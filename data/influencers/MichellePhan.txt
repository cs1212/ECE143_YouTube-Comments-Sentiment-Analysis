Came here after the Tati James Charles drama to remind myself what YouTube and creating art is supposed to be about
Who’s here during the James and Tati drama?
Wanted to remind myself of the old beauty of YouTube


Edit: thank you so much for all the likes! Glad to know I’m not the only one out there feeling the same xo
The reason YouTube has a beauty community is this woman. I miss her.
Michelle, I took your videos for granted. You were straight to the point, creative, and drama-free. The beauty community of today is toxic.
We need you now more than ever, Michelle...
I don't care what anyone says.  Michelle Phan is iconic, will always be a legend, and is an OG YouTube Beauty Guru.

She basically invented or predicted the mainstream success of things like Clarisonic:  "Hey guys buy a sonic oscillating toothbrush and use it on your face to exfoliate."

She also used to pull from her art background and give awesome DIY cheap hacks and tips like using Dawn antibacterial dish soap to clean makeup brushes and beauty blenders - instead of buying expensive cleansers - something that my female relatives still do, up to this very day.
I came here after her recent video with Harpers Bazaar 😭😭
I miss Michelle, she is one in a million ❤️
I hope she's found peace and is creating her own happiness.
She dipped at the right time
I miss her she was the first channel I ever found 😢
2019 Feb anyone? I'm going to wait for years for our sweet queen to return, who's with me?
Michelle Phan is the mother of the beauty community. It all started with her.
Since Michell left, I just feel sad...we have seen to many drama with "new" influencers and its just make me sick. Michelle was so genuine !
I came here after the James Charles and Tati drama. This is true YouTube ❤️
She is much better than "sister" .. please return
I miss Michelle. She was one of the first youtuber that I saw 10 years ago when I was only 10 years old. Crazy
You got out before it really became toxic
It’ll be EPIC when she makes a return
James Charles should refer to this video by Michelle Phan, soon as possible! This lesson and universal statment that impacts those who had the desire of wanting more, along with much more than what meets the eye. 

Update- Thank you so much for reading my comment, guys!
Her plan on a leaving YouTube was good because the beauty community is to toxic or harmful even for the youth
The only youtuber beauty guru with no drama 
Only respect🙏
Reading all the comments. I'm smiling so much. Thank you everyone :)
You're the true icon of the beauty community and I think everyone forgot that. Drama free and straight to the point. You were always so inspirational. In a way I'm glad you're gone because you won't get all caught up in this. I hope you're out there following your dreams and living your best life; you truly were the best. Miss you 🌸
Who watch this video in 2019
who's watching this in 2019
If you want to fly you must give up everery thing that weights you down..
the beauty community is now a mess we miss u michelle
She said she’ll return when she’s inspired to share new ideas. It’s been almost two years. I guess it will be a long time for her to be inspired. :(
I watched this again after seeing Michelle on GTBWM of Harper's Bazaar. Can't wait for the Queen's comeback T_T
Who else came here because of Tati and James Charles?
sometimes i miss the old youtube .. when it was just a platform to upload whatever before money got involved
She should be a role model to aspiring beauty gurus and “influencers”. Not drama hungry people who have little to share and low quality content to promote to their audiences.
To be honest, I really miss the old beauty community. No shade, no drama. It's all about beauty arts behind the makeup with makeup tutorial. No doubt that Michelle Phan is the real mvp of beauty gurus. We all were still young, living with big hopes and big dreams back then, sit in front of pc watching her Barbie Makeup Tutorial Video, which inspired us to do makeup as a kid. And I swear I miss all of that. Incredibly nostalgic. 
It's like the world knew that the community is about to be a huge mess and save Michelle from it, and im glad that she left youtube. You can tell how much she enjoy her peaceful life right now, living as a normal human without chasing the fame. And i'm happy for that. I'm happy that the world could save Michelle from toxic drama. 

Michelle, we will never forget who you are. We still love you and still support you no matter what. Stay who you are. ❤️
What the HELL happened to YouTube...
Please come back Michelle, you left a hole no one can fill.
THE QUEEN 🙌🏻👑 I am so beyond proud of you!
You did the right thing by leaving YouTube with the way the beauty community turned out... I really miss your videos though, they were always wholesome and focused on the thing, we were all here for: Beauty and Makeup
We need YOU again in this community. 😭 We miss you Michelle Phan 💋
but she never returned and probably never will :(
Omg I hope you are okay... you were the first YouTuber I met and the first I subscribed... OMG it’s so sad to see  you go
Find yourself and came back strong 

I love you girl ❤️❤️❤️
This girl needs to be a voice reader for audio books! Her voice is so relaxing
i’m kind of glad michelle left this toxic beauty community behind.

she’s the only ONE who doesn’t care about the fame, she only cared about herself.

she’s the REAL mother of the beauty community.
2019 anyone.....? still watching you Michalle!
I'm so sad she is not on YouTube anymore. I remember being a teenager and watching your tutorials to go out with my friends...miss u Michelle!
whos here after promis‘ video ? just to check if she has a new video 😄
"become succesfull. like a doctor" every Asian parent
this is by far the best video I have EVER viewed on YouTube ✊
Michelle You are the best ❤️
I'm done with the drama(James and Tati)
I was reminded of this beautiful woman today. I remember my entire family loving her. My sister loved her. I loved her, we were young. Neither of us wore  makeup. We are still young, I don’t and my sister barely does. But I enjoyed watching her. Her makeup was awesome. She is inspiring. She’s truthful. This is my beauty community, now and forever ❤️
We need you back this is too much with james
this video is beautiful! i'm glad ur in a better place now, michelle! ❤️ can't wait to see what's next!!
>Who see this video on April 2019?? 
🙋🙋🙋👋👋👋
Your video left me speechless, I never thought life could be so hard although it does get harder when you grow up, and I guess we all know there are ugly things in the world. But despite our plans I think God is always helping us by leading us to our best self, and therefore our happiness. Life is just a set of tests that allow you to know yourself better and grow. I truly admire you, eversince I started watching your videos 7 years ago when my sister showed me a video of your first videos. But I can tell you despite everything that changed, you were always you, awesome, nice, caring and constantly saying that makeup could give us something like super powers jaja. I hope everything improves, you sure deserve it, I must not have been the only one inspired from your make up tutorials, if you need to stop with the tutorials it is ok, as long as you are happy! That is the most important thing and let me assure you tons of your fans wish that for you, including me of course!
Sending you lots of love!!!
Surprised how many people actually came back here recently I think we all just wanted to go back to when makeup was simple and the was no drama what so ever been watching you since 13. I was so sad to see you go but glad to hear there are new adventures for you to be had. I hope you are doing well :) thank you for everything and all your amazing videos.  <3
Im crying. Thank you for sharing this <3 Hope you are doing well
Michelle, I don’t really know you and I didn’t watch you but from your viewers you seem like a nice genuine person. I’m really sad you left you seem like a nice person. 💛
This is so out of the blue but I love your  voice.
I came here after rewatching her videos. How I miss her :( She’s the first beauty guru I ever subscribe.

“Good luck.”
was anyone a kid when her barbie makeup tutorial was uploaded? i was and i miss her ):
she started the whole beauty community and she was also the first one to realize how toxic it was after years of being in it
Came here after Tati James Charles drama beacuse I want to remember why I started watching youtube.
April 2019. I miss you queen
QUEEN! Come back :( the beauty community is messed up without you
come back please the beauty community is toxic and i need quality content 😩❤️
Such a legend!!!!!!😢🤯🙏🏼👀
You left at the perfect time. I miss you.
I came here after the James and Tati tea to remind myself of what the beauty community used to be like without all the scandals
the beauty community got so ugly after she left.
I’m crying so hard ❤️ new fan here xox
I remember when I was 9 years old I found your channel and even though I didn't know anything about makeup. I would watch your videos everyday and when I watched all of them I waited for every single one of your videos. now look at the beauty community, with all this drama. I miss the old beauty community. Its such a shame you don't make videos anymore but your mental health is more important
I understand why she left the Tati and James drama is too much toxic in the the beauty industry..
Who’s here from Harpers Bazaar
You can miss her, you can pray she comes back, but if she isn’t happy, who are you to hold her back?
It feels like 3 years instead of 1 year without her.
I miss you, yet I don't blame you for not ever coming back. Wishing you all the best 😘
I come back to her channel every now and then to be reminded of this message. You're a beautiful soul, Michelle, wishing you the best in all you seek. ❤
Thank you for restoring my motivation in following through on my own creative dreams.
Was Michelle Phan seeing the future of how the beauty community has become so ugly.
WITH ALL THAT BEAUTY GURU DRAMA I MISS MICHELLE PHAN 🍵
I thought I was the only one on an old beauty guru videos binge watch during the James and Tati feud 😂
Even though I’m dark skin I remember watching her videos as a teen. The one video that has always stayed with me that she made is “Kissable Lips”. I found her tips very helpful.
Who else came from Harper Bazaar to rewatch this 😢
The beauty community really needed this right now
Everyone always talks about Tati, James, etc...; but I actually think your makeup tutorials were much more amazing and creative (also art is about inspiring others and people are so caught up in fame they forget that or forget that it comes at a cost. Fame can also come and go which I like how you tell your story to remind people this). I loved that doll and vampire one as it helped inspired ideas for my own style. Your videos were always beautiful and classy. This also shows that when one door closes, another one opens and could be even better than what you originally wanted and planned. More of these beauty influencers should learn from you instead of focusing too much on drama.
Please come back and make the beauty community good again💖
Michelle, i miss you so much, i hope you have a good life now
i love you 🥺❤ the beauty community needs u
i was super sad i love your story and your video i love your family and im super super proud i love you
i’m so glad an amazing and inspiring person like you decided to leave the beauty community
I for real thought this was an ad when i accidentally clicked this video
Ah remember the good old days? When the beauty community was...better
I hear her say God has three answers
"Yes"
"Not yet"
"Or i have something better"
I tear up. So beautiful and hopeful.
This is the first video I'm seeing of Michelle's and I know it certainly won't be my last. She seems so different than the other "beauty gurus" and her journey of finding herself sounds so inspiring to me. I'm definitely subscribing and I can't wait to see what the future holds for you, Michelle!
Comeback we need you , beauty community is way too toxic 😫💖💖
Please come back. We need the "real" beauty youtubers. No drama, just art and having fun.
@jamescharles be careful, don’t loose yourself over money sis.
You cannot compare Michelle's experience to everyone else's. I definitely can't fly away to another country but I'M NOT MAD AT HER just because she can. I mean, seriously. Everyone complains that she's gone for so long. They leave comments, questioning her and asking where she is. And when she finally posts a video explaining they attack her because they don't like her answer. This video isn't about other people and how hard it is for them. It's a response and an EXPLANATION, about HER life and HER decisions. Not about OTHER people struggling. Everyone's life is difficult, but not in the same ways. Grow up. And she can very well promote her makeup brand. Hell, IT'S HER CHANNEL.
I can't believe I'm discovering you so late when you've already left your channel! Everything about this video, the animation, the narration, the lessons...ugh words can't explain how perfect this is. I think this is the most vulnerable,valuable, and truthful video I've ever seen on YouTube. You are officially one of my favorite beauty gurus and I don't even wear makeup! ❤
Gosh, I miss you Michelle. You gave us so many smiles and so much relaxation... you really just appreciated the art of makeup for what it is and shared your love with the world. We need you back!!! We miss you, Michelle. I hope you're happy and doing well, whatever you're doing, wherever you are. 😊💖
wow michelle ever since you left, the beauty industry really took off especially recently with all this james charles and tati westbrook
drama, we need you
Bring back glorious days moment when beauty community was no drama

Hahahaaha
100%. everything you said. 100%. Thank you xx
Oh my God I just stumbled across this girl and already I am crying on this video and didn't even know her.  :'(
My childhood was watching Michelle Phan and Naruto AMVs with epic Linkin Park songs xD I miss my childhood <3 thank you Michelle for being part of it <3
this video is absolutely beautiful you inspired me. I'm crying. Thank you !
This is the first time i saw her video, and dang we lost an amazing true beauty guru.
this is very genuine Michelle. I love your story. help me to grow and learn on how to feel beautiful. #Respect
Oh Michelle, come back, we need you to calm us down in this toxic world.
I miss you so much now in these dark days..
this video still makes me cry. so beautiful. a work of art.
I decided to look back to see how you were doing on youtube. im extremely saddened that you no longer make videos. you’re youtubes first mua.
funny how when a depressed person says that they're depressed someone thinks that because she has money her depression is invalid. Depression can be found everywhere.
i miss michelle but honestly its great that she isnt in this current toxic beauty community, she deserves true happiness
Thank you for reminding us what it is all about
Such an amazing video.
Im crying. Where are you. Im late. Im your new subscriber.
YouTube Is not for real people like you anymore to much clickbate, copypaste, drama, ego stuff, etc just for money. Thanks for Let us believe about dreams come true with your example.
OMG, you're in my book of English
The God of the universe is Jesus Christ. He loves you, created you, died for you, and wants to have a relationship with you if you will turn to Him. He's the One who created the beauty in nature. It is His creation, written like a love letter to us that we might seek the God Who created it. The God of Israel.

Money will never buy happiness, because we are spiritual. Our greatest need is to be reconciled to the Lord, our Creator. This world cannot complete us. It never was meant to. We are made to love, glorify, and belong to God.

For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

Mark ‭-‬36

For some reason I came across your channel again, Michelle, and it reminds of when I was a teenager exploring the realms of old Youtube. At that time I looked for people and things to complete me, but I ended up depressed and suicidal. The only thing I have ever found in this world of real substance, of truth and of love, is Biblical Christianity. Not some denomination or flashy church, but a true relationship with God in Jesus Christ. His love, peace, and joy is greater than anything I've ever known. The truest heights of beauty, creativity, and art come from Him.

We have to recognize that we are sinners, that we are drawn to leading our own lives without giving God any thought, being god over our lives instead. We have not met the standard of perfection: loving God with our whole hearts, minds, and souls, nor loving each other the way we should. We're selfish, prideful, and broken. Without perfect holiness, we cannot enter the Lord's presence in heaven. We deserve hell.

We need a Savior, and Jesus Christ alone is the One who can do it. He wasn't just a mere good teacher or just another prophet. He is God in the flesh, the promised Messiah, who bore the cross to cleanse us from our sins, to purge us from our transgressions. He is the risen Lord and King.

We must believe that He alone can save us, through His death and resurrection. Then we must do the hardest thing. The unimaginable thing. We must repent. Repentance is not a work but a heart change. Jesus needs to become the love and center of our lives. We must be willing to follow Him, even when He says things that are hard to hear or understand. We must lay our earthly lives down and trust Him to give us eternal life. We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone, but this glorious salvation will change our lives. We'll fall out of love with sin and in love with our Savior. The Holy Spirit gives us strength and sanctifies us so we can walk in the light. If we put our faith in Jesus, we're never alone.

I say all this as someone who didn't understand religion or anything about the Bible when I was younger. I didn't want anything to do with it, but the need for truth and salvation doesn't go away even if we ignore it. If you happen to read this, Michelle, continue to seek truth. Go directly to Jesus and His Word and hear what He has to say. You are loved by God and by many who want your highest good.

Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

Isaiah 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

John ‭-‬21
I wish to see Michelle Tutorial again, even though I watched her videos I feel my heart is fulfill and beating fast with excitement...same feeling like I watched her video since I was in high school.
When she says "money can't buy happiness" she's not saying it from the perspective of a rich kid. She's saying it from the perspective of someone who grew up poor, soneone who has been a broke college student with bills to pay and a family to support. She's one of the first big YouTubers. An Asian-american child, she was the daughter of two immigrants. 

Her family was very poor, so she worked extremely hard in school in order to get into a good college and support her family by making a lot of money. But in the end she realized med school was not for her and she applied to art school instead. I believe due to her grades, she even managed to secure a scholarship for art school as well. Her mother was devastated that Michelle would not go to med school but in the end accepted it. The students in Michelle's art school were all presented with laptops, which also had access to internet. She used the webcam to film a beauty tutorial and flash forward to the present: through consistent hard work Michelle has made enough money to support her family.

Anyone who says she has no idea what she's saying, that she couldn't possibly know the true value of money is, I hope after reading this you've gained a new perspective.
this isn’t just a video about beauty and youtube and money. it’s a video for all of the people who are going through something tough. whether it’s depression, anxiety, stress, etc. everyone needs their own time to grow and learn. learning to love yourself isn’t taking a bath or having a “me day”. it’s a slow change. growth comes slowly. give yourself the time to slowly grow.
YouTube was an amazing community back in the day
Your voice is so beautiful 💛
I remember when we first found her.. She was just starting out on her laptop in her bathroom.. The drama with Tati and James.. Brought me here. ❤ She is the GOAT..And I miss her so much.. 😟😭 love you Mich.. Achieve your dreams 💗...
I never knew Michelle Phan, I don't even watch beauty videos but I was curious about YouTubers you don't hear from anymore. My wife loved her and wanted to see what she was up to.

After seeing this I respect her immensely for having the courage to do what was required not cuz she wanted but because she had to.. For herself and her happiness. I did a similar thing, I worked as a vfx artist in the movie industry but I left it all behind to follow my dream of owning my own company. I now fly all over the country for work and spend much needed time with my wife. Walking away is the hardest thing but ultimately it was the better choice.
Where are you now michelle phan? WE REALLY MISS YOU..
You are the legend😍
Edited :
We will wait you until you get back!
This video was so beautiful
I had to re-visit after all of this JAMES and Tati drama!
Makeup should be beautiful , but today's makeup YT community is so toxic . Michelle was Art , her channel not only helped with makeup but life in general . Miss u so much Mish
Shane needs to make a series with her , there is so much i need to know about her and her life .. so much
I hope you’re doing well and happy Michelle but i miss you so much. We all miss you so much. We miss your videos!! THE BEAUTY COMMUNITY NOW IS SO TOXIC gosh
literally the first ever channel i subbed to. i miss when youtube was this pure
I miss you so much. I'm watching this again, I was remembering when I finished the college I did my makeup with one of tour tutorials, the same when I get married. You inspired me to use makeup when I did't know nothing about it. Thank you Michelle, I Will wait for you'r return, greetings from México, I wish you the Best. God bless you always.
I hope james charles would realize how michelle realized that fame and money can consume them
Her voice is really soothing.
We miss you our OG makeup God 💜
I've been wat hing you since 2009, and honestly, you were the best thing beauty YouTube had before all these clowns (Jane's, Jeffree, Tati, etc) came in the scene. Congratulations on your continuous growth.
Who came after reading a Twitter reply?
Someone send this to the despicable three 😧😂
"If you want to fly, you have to give up everything that weighs you down."
healty vibes... faaaar away from jeffree tati and james...drama drama drama
She is without doubt one of the pioneers on beauty here on YouTube.. this video was really nice to watch, we miss you Michelle and hope you come back cuz we are waiting for you ❤
the good old days when the beauty community was actually about beauty. 
nowadays, it's just toxic and focuses on drama more than makeup. we miss you, michelle!
I re-watch this video every time I feel sad, this makes me feel better because it's just so real and it reminds me of what truly matters. Thanks Michelle <3
dear people in the comments, don't compare your life with others. because everyone have different problems, different solutions and different happiness.
I remember myself watching your lady gaga transformation video, you were one of those people who really inspired me to become more confident in my own skin, and I can't thank you enough for that. I have always looked up to you ever since you first started doing youtube. I hope you do find yourself and get the peace of mind that you've been looking for❤️ we are always here for you!😘
I came here to cleanse. Michelle Phan was the Queen.
Please come back we need you in the beauty community
Don’t mind me. Just crying over here 💔
Who was here before 1mil? Love you Michelle
Waiting for your comeback 💜💜💜💜💜
Michelle, the beauty community needs you back!!!!
I didnt know she left.. im a huge fan since she started.. but at one point i stopped watching coz i got busy. The "good luck" in the end made me emotional.. 😭
This is the greatest motivated video. I watched this when this came out & again m here. I feel her words. Hope she is happy now
oh my dear God. I almost cried 40 thousand times. Proud of you for being so honest,  I've watched you since 2008. So proud!
Really inspiring. 2019 anyone?
6:06... it’s ok ❤️🥺 Michelle you’ve gave me so much happiness it’s now your turn. Please take as long as you need. Good luck!
We all miss you...❤️ just waiting on you to return. ❤️❤️❤️
Good Luck Michelle. Just be happy!

we miss you Michelle 💔 this is real
God damn I miss this girl so much
no matter how many MUA there are. you were always the first. you were the one I looked up to when wanting to do a glam. your videos gave me inspiration and hope. miss you Michelle. no rush to come back to social media. take the time you need for yourself girl 💕 will always have love for you
I miss our queen so much, we love you Mich!!
I hate so much drama in the beauty community, I miss how things were back when Michelle Phan was doing videos.
Michelle this is absolutely beautiful. Good for you for having the courage to step out and heal, I can't wait to view your new projects.
I miss you Michelle 🥺 March 30, 2019
Two years later...........
Where are you now?
i don’t blame her at all for leaving. the beauty community is TOXIC. i do wish that she would make a comeback though it would be so iconic. ☹️
you just remind me whats life truly mean to me :(
You're my first inspiration.. Thanks Michelle.. I always love u..
So true! Money does not buy happiness. Only God can fulfill that.
I just found your channel, and this is incredible. I resonate with everything you said, especially about the part where your mother cried when you decided to pursue your dreams instead of hers (and her hopes for you to lead a stable life with a steady income is understandable). The difference between us, though, is that you followed your intuition and I chose to be practical. I don't necessarily regret my choices, though, but I really admire you for believing in yourself and taking control of your life. Your story is really incredible, and even though I'm posting this two years later I just want to say that you're onto even greater things, whichever they may be, big or small.
Her voice is so soothing it makes me calm, she’s such a brilliant person, so inspiring as well
Honestly, looking at some of the comments that have already popped up, I can see part of the reason why she left. Whether you are rich or poor, anyone can be affected by depression. It's almost as if because she is Michelle Phan she's not allowed to feel isolated or lost- money or not, she is still human. People don't wake up one day and decide they want to have depression, or feel lonely or lost and the fact that society still thinks this way about mental health shows how backward our thinking really is. Michelle, thank you for the beautiful message and animation in this video, please never stop learning! x
I miss the days of Michelle phan! Back when everything was drama free and simple
Love your every videos, this one is something which will last forever,  you are special.  Thank you! 
God bless you,  feel and let the world fell happy!
You were the first person I watched to learn how to put eyeliner and I admired you ever since and now more! Best of luck. You picked the right choice. You chose yourself!!
Came here because of my favorite Filipino youtuber😍 I realized that she is so trueeeee.
Anyone else want her to return 
Just watched a few videos of you today and saw your channel for the first time and you are truly inspirational and surely one of my fav youtuber I don't know if you will check the comments or ever read this one but if you then I just want to say that your youtube fam is waiting
We miss you, thank you for being my inspiration everytime ❤️ 
March, 2019, who still there?
Re-watching at 2019... What a big soul 🙌🏻😊
Dear Michelle, thank you for making me i inspired and get out of deppresion. Itll be really hard too not seeing you post but i know it's for youre mental health❤

Thank you so much for changing my life ❤
I've been a subscriber for many years Michelle, and I've loved seeing you grow; whether it be your technique or content choice. Only you know what's best for yourself. I'll welcome you back to this community with open arms, whether that be today or in 6 months time, the most important thing is that you're at peace with your current state. We love you very much<3
it's 3:58 am why am i still awake
Thank you. Somehow this helped me feel better, too.
Feb 2019 any one??
I missed the person who taught me that beauty is beyond what the eye can see, to love w/o shame & to appreciate what the eye can't see. I have never been more inspired by every videos u have shared. Though I missed all of these, I understand that u have ur own life. 

Take ur time (tho i hope it wont be forever). I'll be checking from very so often waiting for ur return. Hope to meet u someday.. God bless u, dear 😘

Love,
Ann 😉
money can't buy me happiness, but it sure as hell makes living with misery easier.
March 2019, still waiting 😿
This was a well done video about your journey. Thank you for sharing your personal story.
On a different note, I just watched you on Get unready with me I was wondering even if you don't wear foundation when you go out do still wear lipstick, blush and eyeliner/mascara when you go out?
Sending love! Virtual hug to you, Michelle:)
SO BRAVE AND INSPIRING... you were one of the first people that ever got me into makeup. i would binge watch you and panacea's tutorials. thanks so much for sharing such a personal experience with us. THIS, is what the beauty community needs.
i feel like i was watching a short film
She was the first tutorials i ever watched in makeup
If you see this Michelle, just letting you know how much I miss your vids, and I hope you’re happy and doing well 😊 Not sure if you’ll ever come back to Youtube, but I’m good as long as you’re at peace ❤️ Take care! And thank you for all your wonderful and fun makeup tutorials 😭🙏
April 2019 watched again after a year . Still a beautiful video still teaching me something. You never stop learning. 
Hope all is great Michelle!! ❤️
August 2018 anyone?
Michelle Phan and bubzbeauty were my first two beauty gurus! ❤️😭
This is the deepest thing I have heard in all my years 💞💓💕💖💗
We all love and miss you! 

You started BEAUTY YOUTUBE sending so much love from the UK you absolute beautiful strong women.
Guys, Michelle just did a video with Harper's Bazaar!! She did her night care routine and it was soooo refreshing hearing her positive voice 😭
I miss your voice it's so authentic and relaxing.
Thank you Michelle 💜💜💜💜 I miss you
Its may 2019 and still watching this!
The one who started it all. I remember watching her lady gaga makeup tutorial so long ago. Oh how time flies. Miss you 🤧:(
I wanted so badly to become successful (rich) right now, because I wanted to be happy. But I'm reminded of this video.
Seeing you go through all this right before my eyes, I can tell you you've definitely blossomed in a beautiful Butterfly like the one we saw on our hike. Let see where life takes you .. Hopefully to a land with lot of yummy Pork buns and Bunnies !!!!
Please return and save the beauty community!!
Beauty industry id falling since she left
-using shoes as an sponge just proves this
MICHELLEEEE I MISS YOU. WE MISS YOU. ❤ i miss your videossss. You remind us always what the beauty community IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. its so toxic and disgusting now. I miss your normal videos, just with music and the background and maybe some small intro in the start. i hope you come back. but if you really wont, theres nothing we can do but wish you the best. I hope you become more successful and happier. ❤
Beautiful soul you are Michelle. Come back plz. Miss you dear. 😢
I wanted to poke Michelle way back in 2009.
Time flys!!!
I miss michelle phan😥 unlike the michelle dy here in the Philippines 🙄
When will you come back Michelle?! I miss your videos they were the highlight of my days.
MICHELLE PLEASE COME BACK YOU NEED TO SAVE THE BEAUTY COMMUNITY
I miss the old YouTube, where when you searched anything. You saw a person who turned on their potato camera and talk about something they’re actually PASSIONATE about.
Not some fortnite YouTube hungry for money:(
Anyone here after Promise's video?
We didnt appreciate her enough until she left the beauty industry and the world of YT. She was such an inspiration :'c im sorry Michelle. Took me 2 years to watch this video :c
I happened across your channel by accident about five years ago. Your makeup tutorials helped shape my own cosplay anime makeup routine for when I go to conventions. I always loved your videos. I hope you come back soon, Michelle. I'll be waiting until then! ;)
I love you, Michelle!!! You taught me so much!!! God bless you!!!
She is the 1st makeup guru I watched on youtube and will always be my favourite. I hope she find what she's looking for. I hope she will stay happy and healthy.
I feel so bad. I wish she comes back with a bang,😞 I grew up watching her videos. N I always watch her videos coz they make me feel happy and confident. U are my inspiration @michellephan
Thank you for sharing this...
This made me tear up😢😭 praying for your comeback Mitchell🙏😞❤️
we are still waiting for you michelle, we miss you :)
I miss her!! She always knew how to keep it classy! The beauty gurus these days are full of drama and exposing people! Not too mention the makeup look these days look so over done with contour and highlight. Michelle made that possible without using all of that! I hope she’s doing well ☺️💖
To be honest....I was so little....I watched your vids....you inspired me and now you...left....two words...thank you...
a fan
-Sofia, April 23 2019
Wow... i came back to this video and saw that this was 1 year ago... i thought this video was like 3 or 5 years ago.. this really shows that old youtube is so much better thank you so much michelle for these years 💗💗
I miss you :,(
I miss her so much..she was the one teaching me how to do my make up since 6 th grade. Now I go to university
i miss her so much. i would always watch her. 😭😭😭
We miss you Michelle. I hear that she'll be back this summer. And I hope she's coming back stronger than ever. Good Luck.
Who is here after all the drama between those crazy so-called beauty gurus and MUA's 😒 God bless you Michelle ❤ you did the best with leaving from all this shit.
You may never see this comment, but I came to your channel after years of not watching. Although I no longer religiously watched your videos, I started to see you on TV, and was so happy for you. The reason why I stopped coming, is because after a certain point it felt like your videos were being monitored, and became unnatural. As if there was an outside authority controlling your content, and when I saw the commercials thought you sold out (gave up too much of your freedom). I came back today to see what you might be up to on here. This video was so amazing, and raw, it felt like it was really you this time! Anyways, as someone that learned a lot about make-up from you, and looked up to you - it's amazing to know you were able to see the signs as well, and make better for yourself. Good luck, and hope to see new videos from you soon. Even art related, family, or anything that interests you! You're an inspiring person to many ^^ (p.s. gonna watch your new nighttime routine video now ♥)
most genuine human ever. 
all the love 💝
I absolutely love, respect and adore this. ♥️
We miss you ❤️
I miss this. I miss real people not people attacking each other. Making money and hurting others it’s more important this days. Smh.
I swear this woman is magical her voice and ways of telling things are just beautiful. I hope 2017 is the year Michelle Pham comes back healed and better than ever
Michelle will never be forgotten❤️
I miss you and your content. You inspired me when I struggled to see the beauty in myself. I can’t wait till you come back and share your growth/journey.
so true 
.... some.people.sre comfortable w being the same
I needed to watch you story again today. This might be silly, Michelle, but you've always brought me happiness, and I love you. Take all the time you need because... we'll be waiting. Good luck.
Powerful story from a beautiful soul.  Thank you for listening to your inner child and following your highest heart!  Nature really is our refuge and brings us back into total truth and harmony.  Very excited to see what unfolds next on your journey <3 Much Love to you Michelle <3
We are waiting for your journey back to YouTube. Perhaps you can assist with its restoration. 💕✨
I’m glad you got out of that toxic beauty community, we will support you❤️
I miss you! Love from Holland! 😘
Transcendental Meditation as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi....to know they self. the purpose of life is the expansion of happiness. Life if here to enjoy - tm.org
I'd rather be sad and rich than sad and poor.
you may never come back but you’ll stay iconic forever. miss you queen. the beauty world is going down hills here in yt.
I needed to hear her voice, I needed the motivation and inspiration that inspired and got me going so many years ago, I needed to hear from this lady that made me love myself and started my love for makeup and art. I needed her to say GOOD LUCK ❤️. I MISS HER 😭
3:02 “I did it mom!” I started tearing up at that moment😭
If money buys happiness, then tell me- how much does it cost? You don't know, right?
Far out, this video is so relevant with the way youtube and social media is these days! Honestly, thank you for making this video, as i'm sure it helped many more people than you're aware of.
She started the Beauty Community on YT. She was our founder (ipSy). She has her own make-up line (Em Cosmetics). She's a legend. ❤🥰
I watched Michelle since I was a teen. Once I discovered her, I would always search her on YT whenever I get the chance to get online. If there are no new uploads, I would go back and watch her old videos - everything! She has inspired me so much!
If you feel sad that Michelle has left, don’t worry, you have hope. You can find her on EM cosmetics. In a YouTube video. :)
“As a kid, we don’t care about money, we just care about happiness”

I wish the world was still like that. I’m 12 and I’m choosing my career when I grow up over money even if I don’t want to do it :(
I've been following Michelle since 2009. she's one of the original OGs  of the makeup tutorials. I have nothing but respect for her.
i just scoured my old youtube to find u again and i see this 😫
I come back and watch this video once in a while. I remeber spending hours watching Michelle's tutorials. I was mesmerized by her talent, soothing voice and brilliant story telling. I do not enjoy watching makeup tutorials now, as they are just driven by money and the 'celebrity culture' and not to help and inspire the average woman like me. Thank you for the escapism you gave me and Thank you for being true to you. "GOOD LUCK" 💜
I miss you and your lovely inspiration. You were a glowing light to goodness for me. Sending love and dreams your way in this new year💕💕
I miss when Michelle was the most subscribed beauty guru. We need you more than ever now with all this beauty guru drama 🙄
Idgaf what anyone else has to say but Michelle Phan forever sits on the Beauty Guru throne, she paved the way for most of these beauty gurus!
March 2k19?
Vietnamese loves you.
Miss you so much Michelle Phan...you're the reason why i know how to make-up! 😘😘😘
I miss finding myself in you..i grew watching you and feel.apart of me left
I watched the whole video and it gave me tears which usually dont happened. I can relate to your childhood and the stress as a kid. My childhood was very similar to yours growing up. My mom was also a nail tech, my father was a gambler that I always constantly hear them fight about money, scared where we would go next. An artistic child i was I would always sit in front of the television and sketch Sailormoon and dragon ball z which was my escape. i remember the times as a kid i wish i had a childhood like all the other children that experience stability, prom, sleep overs, having a home to go to, memories with friends, riding bikes. Your journey, im so happy for your success and did you. I also do videos on YouTube because I also love to create and hope i can impact other people lives like you did for me. I hope you are having a wonderful day and thank you for posting this video.
I hope our queen Michelle is doing well. We love you and we all think your choice was a good one :)
I miss you Michelle! I wish you could come back. :(
Damn not even into makeup but the message was beautiful 😭
Honestly I've watched Michelle Phan since I was a midget. I really enjoyed her content and the community until something changed. I didn't know what exactly but it felt like all of the sudden a bunch of stereotypical Tumblr users I believed have been dubbed "Tumblrinas" from other sites just started trashing everything Michelle stood for. Honestly, I'm glad she left for the sole purpose that you just need to get away from the internet and it's toxicity a lot, but I hope she comes back in whatever pace she feels most comfortable with to remind people what YouTube was based off of 🖤
it's ok to be sad. It's ok Michelle. I am so proud of you and what you became. You are the inspiration for me to be happy everyday. We miss you Michelle. Come back when your ready.
Jesus says: "I am the way, the truth and the life, no one can come to the father but through me." We were always, since the beginning of everything, created to find happiness in our father's arms who loves us more than we can ever hope for. No amount of fame and fortune can give us what our heart truly desires: the right and righteous way, the real truth and the refreshing and fulfilling life. May God bless you on this exciting journey so that you may encounter your real identity in his presence. :-)
I love this video it's inspiring! I want to change my life for the better and grow that's why I will keep on learning
Omg my Lifestory (just without the YouTube part)
Dear Michelle i remember watching your videos and thinking how talented you are. This video is truly heartbreaking for me,since you are the most real beauty guru i have seen on the internet. You made me feel happy and confident. It's so sad that one of,the most talented and great beauty youtuber has left. This beauty community is so toxic. We are losing real talents lately. That's sad. We all love you and support you. I was watching you on my previous channel i am going to subscribe to you in this one even if you don't do videos. 💖💖 I hope you see this and know how much your fans support you 😭😭😭
That "good luck" at the end brought back so many memories. I don't blame you for leaving, Michelle. Good luck with whatever you decide to do next! ❤️
Jan 2019. Still waiting for you phan. Miss u from India
Come back. The whole beauty community on Youtube are sellouts!
If this doesn't prove to you that we are experiencing a spiritual revolution than you probably aren't going to be evolving with us. Thank you fir your authenticity Michelle🙏🏼❤️
Michelle, you were the firsf beauty guru I fell in love with. I miss your positiveness, I miss your inner beauty. I miss seeing you.
When will you come back???
😭😭😭
I miss you so much you were the first I had watched on YouTube
I am so in to this... be happy is the only thing that matters in life... but... happy for real.❤️
Ooh Michelle 💖 we miss you so much and we're patiently waiting for your return...
Michelle needs to come back and get these Beauty gurus together ASAP! Whole community been a mess since she left, return to your kingdom Queen!!!!!
Switzerlaaaand😂😂😂❤
Come back, Michelle.
We miss you. ❤️
i wonder what she's been doing all these months.....
I only just read the description. SHE'LL RETURN WHEN SHE'S INSPIRED TO SHARE NEW IDEAS! Take your time love, we miss you xx
She really paved the way for the beauty community. Legend. This girl I know loves all these toxic ass beauty gurus and when i talked about Michelle Phan she was like who? Makes me sad people missed out on such an inspiration
I used to watch Michelle when I was little 😭 remembered her and didn't expect this.
She always needed privacy and I respect that.
I really miss you Michelle. You're the one who inspired me to love makeup and to be confident in my own way. I was always entertained by your makeup looks, ideas, and your beautiful personality. You are definitely my favorite person to watch on youtube and you always will be. I still watch your old videos and i still have hope that you will come back to youtube someday. thanks for inspiring me love you ❤️❤️❤️
Its been a year, I miss youuuu
Why is everyone so bitter about her success lol. She's a person of ethnic minority and came from very a low economic status. She had many odds against her- it's not like she had everything handed to her on a silver platter. If anything, it should be inspiring?
omg this has a huge game animation feels! your voice is like that of a heroine's 😍😍😍😍
I learned all my makeup skills from your Makeup tutorials. The first youtuber I know 😊 I remember going to internet café after school and spend $1 to watch your videos.
🙏💕💕 you are wonderful, don’t listen to anyone.. follow your heart, you come first..
the way she's talking makes me think of Avatar the Last Airbender and the way Katara intros the show
this makes me so sad because you are the inspiring, creative person that we love on youtube. I respect and understand your choice though. Good luck<3
I miss Michelle . I remember as a kid watching these tutorials when i first started dabbling in makeup as a kid. I loved youtube in the old days when everything was fun, memes and love
watched again and still hoping for your return!! 
you are the first person i started to follow on youtube and would always be waiting for your new videos all the time!
used to watch the videos so many times and was always amazed of how talented you are. 
please come back one way or the other <3
Michelle Phan was the reason why I started doing makeup & taught me how to do makeup !
This video got me so emotional. God bless you Michelle. I wish you all the best.❤️
i miss you so much i remember growing up watching your videos and you were just mesmerizing
I miss you Michelle! I've been binge watching all your videos. Patiently waiting for your return. ❤
The beauty community has been so toxic lately
Michelle u are the reason i became MakeUpArtist.. i was with you from the very first steps in Youtube.. i miss ur energy ur ideas ur positivity... i hope from my heart u are in a better place and happier than ever!! We thank you for every secret u share with us for lighting us with ur makeup tutorials! Maybe u wasnt happy with that but u was making us happy and that’s something very beautiful because u was sharing ur love and  everything with us! Good luck in ur life! U are a star! Thank you for everything!!
She is definitely an OG for the Youtube beauty community. And she is also a tale, precautionary or not, on how to stay humble and how to overcome that evil of ego, fame and money. 
She at least has the humility to admit she was getting weak and from there grow stronger.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ we love you!!!! Thank you for sharing your story. I am experiencing a similar journey and this is so powerful and inspiring. Thank you, again for helping you and us feel more beautiful.
Remember when Michelle Phan was the queen of beauty community? Yeah, me too.
yes, i want u to show me how to feel beautiful
When you gonna come back and sit on your throne , queen.  Your kingdom is now full of drama n we miss you
Her voice is so magical.
Tears to my eyes since Sailor moon look was the first time I discovered her videos 💕 I’ll always come back ✨
I don't have an elder sister, but I miss you as if you are my elder sis... Love you 😘
Damn she really left...
Miss you Michelle 💕
Michell please don’t leave 
this channel I love you
No one going to mention how beautifully thought out this was? I was hypnotised!
2019 anyone??? Oh I really miss her😢😭💞
I like a lot about who your personality is.. You are right being pretty is inside of who you are like flower that shine..
Same. This is exactly why I left all forms of social media as well! It’s not worth it, it never was and never will be; it’s a dark hole. Toxic and constantly dwelling people into its perplexed form of “reality.”
COME BACK QWEENNN♥️♥️😩
This is so beautiful ❤️
We love you Michelle! You're so strong and you're such an inspiration!
ITS 1am AND IM CRYING I ACFUALLY MISS HER 💔💔💔
She is so gifted ❤
why I left buzzfeed
We miss you! You are the first youtuber that I looked up to since I was 12 (I’m now 21😢) I learned everything from u abt make up and stuff😔 pls come back!💜
You have been on youtube for what 11 years and your leaving
This is making me cry so much
I cried during the video and still am
I will never forget you Michelle phan! When I was like 7 or so I found your videos and started trying to do makeup and it always made me happy  when I went onto your channel and a brand new video was there but over time the community became toxic and you were the only youtuber to stay true to yourself! No matter how long you're gone (even if it is forever) I want you to know you were the one to help me feel happy on thise sad and lonely days you were the one to help me find a passion in makeup YOU were the one that help me find mental peace. And I can never thank you enough for that xoxo
The best story teller alive. Made me tear up. 😘😭😻
I was just looking at beauty books and saw her book and just came to this channel to see who she was. WOW, what a beautiful story. I look forward to feeling more beautiful!
We miss and love you Michelle!❤💋🦄 Please come back!!😢
WE MISS YOU MICHELLE 😭😭😭💜💜💜💜
Are you going to complete your story on webtoon? Please complete it because you are a really perfect author and artist. You are one of my role models and when I grew up I want to be just like you. My family wants me to become doctor too and I really like to become a animation maker. Can I make your story a animation in the future? I will tell everyone about the real author.one more thing: I think there is lots of people that like your story and they are waiting for you too completel your story.love you 

Parmis ❤️
I honestly wouldn't blame her for leaving YouTube... God knows how she must be feeling now reading so many negative comments. God bless your family Em, I have so much respect for them for raising such a pure and innocent daughter like you. Unfortunately the world isnt what it once was... and I truly believe that there are only a few people in the world that are pure and real, and it just so happens that one of those few became famous on YouTube. If her mind was on money like how most of you presume because of the ad at the end then she wouldnt have stopped making videos on YouTube because thats where the real money comes. For her to advertise her OWN work isnt a problem, because just like us she wants to continue earning, not just for herself but for her family. Em find God and connect with him and you will be happy forever. Good Luck ♡
she has another YouTube called ASMR Phan.
Michelle I love you 😍 ♥ please come back 😢 ♥
After watching this video, you are so inspirational. You are such a beautiful and strong person❤️
Much respect to the godmother of YouTube and beauty
The irony is her first video " natural makeup" and her last video " why i left " both got 12 million views **!!!
I really miss your voice, smile and the message in your videos.
I wish to bring back the old youtube. Where Michelle Phan is.

:<
Wow this is crazy I read Helios femina a really long time ago and it crazy to think I stumbled upon this video that was truly really inspirational it even made cry that for telling your story 💜
I miss you mitchelle please...we miss you....😭😢
Note to Laura Lee and Manny Mua... this is how you grow. Not grow within a month.
I miss you!
May 2019 Anyone? ❤️
Miss your videos so much 😢💞
2019 anyone??
She was the first “beauty gurus” I watched. My bf actually lives in her hometown when she was first getting big. He said everyone would go to the boiling crab because she was a waitress there! Small world!!
You go girl follow your dreams will be here waiting for when you do come back to tell us all about your new adventures and I hope all your hopes and dreams come true you can’t be a YouTube forever sometimes you have to fly in order to find a true destiny but when you do find it let us know we will be excited to find out your new journey and everything you have learned along the way we will always have your videos and everything that you have taught us and maybe you will teach us something else new when we see you again thank you For the time you spent with us on YouTube🙏💕💕💕
You were one of the first YouTubers I fell in love with. I adore you no less to this day and am happy you are leading a happier life 😊
thank you Michelle <3 I followed you as a young teenage girl when you did your first videos, and i feelt like you  were like a good friend and similar too me, I also always liked makeup routines and learned alot of my basics from you. Then i also feelt that lost connection when your videos became more famous and I stopped watching, now a few years later by mistake I see this video and WOW! I did not know that you were also an artist besides the makeup, so am I and have always been since i was a kid! funny! I feel that strong connection again! cool. <3 I still love your voice and videos <3
This video just spoke to my soul 😭. I used to watch Michelle’s videos when I was younger and even now I watch them when I feel depressed cause they remind of a much better time when I was young and felt happier.
One of the of the og youtubers. I remember that video of her curling her hair with strips of paper bags.  I miss the old YouTube.  Money does ruin everything.
not going to lie.... i cried watching this
She was such a massive part of my childhood wow
hello 2019 March!!
Admirable.  Genuine.  Thank you.
For the first time in a long time, we're finally seeing the real Michelle Phan and I love it. Thank you for discussing so many relevant issues that I know are not only really difficult to discuss, but also very vital to talk about nowadays. Social media essentially is an escape a platform to look and envy the lives of other people, but really lives conveyed on social media are typically perpetuated false perfection so I really admire how you were able to inform people about that because I think nowadays it's common for people to believe and want lives of others that aren't even reality. Though the issue is not social media itself, but ourselves who contribute to that system.
i srsly miss her :(((
I really miss her so much
we miss u queen 🤧💗
I watch this video again every now and then just because it’s so inspiring. 
Thank you
She was the pride of our nation
Waiting for you to come back :(
Miss you so much :( Hope you come back soon!
I wish she never left however it was her decision and a smart one. I miss you Michelle you were my inspiration 😞
I love you Michelle. 😢
Michelle, your story cut me deep. Thank you for this. 
I'm glad it took you the time to recollect yourself. 
Thank you.
Michelle Phan ftw!
I miss you 😭❤️
COME BACK NOW MICHELLE😢😢😢😢
You are always the Queen ♥️
We miss you Michelle 😢
This feels like way longer than a year ago
the only Draw My Life vid that actually matters . . .
Here to remember what the "beauty community" used to be. #InnerAndOuterBeauty
So are u making a video again I stayed for so long waiting
....it'd be nice if Michelle had a self-improvement podcast. Her voice is really soothing and this video alone has left an impression in me.
I love you Michelle Phan 😭💕
First Michelle and then Marzia stepped out... now I went back to this vid full of sorrow but somehow relieved that 2 of only beauty channel creators left this toxic community before its too late :")
Missing you so much. You have a golden heart. Much love from Philippines
What a beautiful video, its like those sad anime endings. Be well on your journey!
Yay Michelle Phan. Is Back. I idolize you. Its Okay to CHANGE.. CHANGE is GOOD. but how you change sets you apart from the rest. Whatever path you choose we will always be there to support you. Even when you are st your worst.. Don't let your ego cloud your judgment. Your AMAZING just the way you are... I LOVE YOU MICHELLE
Constantly coming back to your channel if you ever came back 😢 I miss you Michelle, your one in a million 😢💕
Just one day...she’ll return :’) take ur time
I miss u michelle phan😘😘😘
I really miss you I hope your healing 🥺 I will never stop supporting you💓💓
"next video why i left again lol" Seriously? She didn't said "im back" This is her last video. Stop bullying her...
2019 and i am still crying
This is the most beautiful upload. I’m fortunate to have stumbled across this. Makes so much sense . 💚
i miss you Michelle, WE are still here.
Exceptional Michell !!! Bravo!
I noticed when people become famous others will tend to dehumanize them and criticize them as if they were products. Like I feel bad how our culture tends to be so desensitized to celebrities pain and struggles.Just because they have an abundance of success does not mean their pain is any less real than ours.
I wonder what she is doing now!! Is she on ig still or any social media at all?
Still watching your old Videos michelle ❤❤ You are the best ❤
Been here since ricebunny! :)
I found myself in her
I just wanna say I freaking love her voice. I can listen to her all day.
I'm just seeing this video today. Your story is so touching and I can relate so much. I got teary eyed. Good for you Michelle!
You Did Justice To It Amazingly, Thank You For All The Happiness And Influence Us To Be Happy & Be A Honest Person, Michelle' You Did It!, You Are A Diamond Out Of Coal, Love You & God Bless You... My Prayers Are With You In Jesus Name
Thank you for sharing! This video is so inspiring and to be aware of true yourself!
Watching this again, after a year later, makes me sad because it's how life is. Watching this again makes me want to start my life again. Thank you, Michelle
I've been watching your videos since I was young and here I am, an adult now. Man, times fly and people grow. It's amazing how you can feel so connected to someone you've never met before. I'm glad you're finding ways to identify yourself. I missed you, and you are truly a beauty. Inside and out ❤️
I hope you are doing well. I wish you the best.
i love you Michelle ❤️
Come back! I miss you!
Michelle please come back and save the beauty community. The community you started and paved the way for all the “MUA”
In no way, shape, or form did she have to share any of this with us. She didn't owe us anything. I'm thankful that she shared such a private part of her life and struggles. I'll always be a dedicated subscriber and fan of her work, and brand. 

Thank you Michelle for being the amazing human you are!
Your the best drawer i love you
Please tell me this amazing girl didn't left her 8.8mill family😢
OMG WHEN VENETIANPRINCESS APPEARD I JUST SCREAMEDDDDDDDDD
wow this awesome ..... I hope urn having fun. and come back soon
plasease upload like this more this is the most beautiful things I ever heard I would love to hear like this and your the most amazing story teller I am waiting for the another next video like this❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This gave me the biggest goosebumps especially the ending ☹️☹️
Michelle, I am so happy that you got out. You are and will always be a legend. Please please PLEASE live for you baby girl. We all love you and wish the best!
OMG she literally sound like an anime dub
Aww Michelle this is heartbreaking hate the idea of you being in pain 😞 I'm glad your on this new journey
Mish, come back.... lead the new generation. We need more people like u here. Doesnt have to be beauty videos. Unless u feel like u really dont want to anymore, we, of course will understand. 💙💙💙👯
Definitely missing you. You will never be replaced or forgotten. You were a great YouTuber☹️❤️
I cried so hard...... we miss you Michelle!!!!!!
Such a deep and inspiring video. Very emotional 💕
missin u so much! 😭
We miss you ! I grew up watching you
Thank you for this video, I feel like there are times when you just have to detox yourself from social media and reconnect with reality again.
This so sad than my love story
June 2018 anyone?
Just like Dave Chappelle and Chappelle show.
Beautiful, thank you for sharing this  you are amazing 😍😍
So videos on growth it is 😊
Who misses Phan in Feb 2019
That was so beautiful.

I have so many exams to study for, I was feeling useless and lost. Not knowing what I want to do in life and for who I'm truly doing it. I was stressed, ready to give up but, I didn't.

And then I found this video. This amazing, inspirational, heartfelt piece of work that helped me realize many things in its  minutes.

Thank you so much for this Michelle, I needed it and I'm sure many others did as well. 

Good luck to everyone that's going through exams right now, have courage, you'll make it 😄
Michelle, you are still my idol, I have been watching you ever since I loved your makeup videos. But whatever makes you happy then go for it! Love you
this is so beautiful and made me cry
I miss you michelle❤
I am one of those people that loved your videos in the beginning , then i noticed the shift in your videos😕so like most people i simply was just not interested any more. I stumbled across this video, even though i am a year late and by now hopefully you will be coming back if not totally understand, it all makes sense now💡you are so talented and i wish youtube wasn’t as demanding as it is now. But some things you cant change. Thank you for this upload and opening up like you did✨ 💜💕 your still my #1 beauty guru...
Reading all these hate comments in the YouTube section and you come to realize how insecure other people are with their own lives that they have to trash on someone else trying to remake her life. So what she has money? So what she's famous? That doesn't mean she can't feel the same emotions of uncertainty, doubt, lack of control. This video is about her trying to find her way again. She DID NOT shove her makeup line or new comic down your throat. She mentioned it at the end. The focus of this video is her fight for success, as well as its repercussions. So stop hating and just listen to her story. Leave your egos and self-hatred at the door.
We miss you, Mich :(
This is the most gentle but powerful video I have watched in a year.
I miss you so much. You were such a blessing to me growing up. You were like a friend.
you are an amazing and inspiring woman and i hope you're happier now michelle, thank you for your videos and inspiring us all. may only good things lie in your path ❤️
A beautiful soul indeed
After all these years I still miss her, shes the reason i wanted to get into makeup, she inspired me so much. I hope whatever shes doing right now, she's happier, we still love you Michelle Phan
英語は分からないけど好きでした。
Are she and Dom still together?
when you started talking about how you felt good when you disconnected yourself , that was beautiful
You know with that thumbnail i thought United Airlines struck again.
She says she will come back!
Michelle Phan is really missed...
Oh my, I just came across Michelle's post here. I watched her when she first came on the scene. Always a favorite and a true beauty inside and out. 💞
I miss you Michelle and you're still my fav. 2019!
Your voice is so relaxing. Also, this video almost brought me to tears.
i miss michelle so much :(( she was such an inspiration to others
She soo inspiring✨
Michelle i learned so much from you 💖💖😭😭 i miss seeing your face or a new video, i started watching you when you first uploaded the video of you transforming into lady gaga and then barbie! I died my hair blonde cause of that video!! You are such a great inspiration! 💖💖
HONEY DO FOR ME
Thank you michelle 💞
it makes me cry! we will always miss you, love you and support you no matter what. I learned a lot from this video, thank you Michelle. You are one in a million, and you actually influenced me to love makeup  :'"" We love you so much, be strong and good luck :')
Oh Michelle🥺 I hope one day you come back to us ... sometimes you cross my mind and i run back to your page hoping to see a video from you. You were part of me growing up, you thought me to love my self. I still think of the old days me and my cousin watching your videos like dude look at this girl she created this look! Lets do it! Ugh 😪 you will forever be the QUEEN❤️ much love and respect wherever you are my dear❤️ thanks for helping me bloom through out my high school years.
Man I miss her videos
She is such an inspiration.
It’s been 11 years I miss you so much... my inspiration💕
I needed to see this.
Thanks for sharing all these true sides:) thanks
I totally get why she did this. YouTube has become nothing but drama. I hope Michelle finds peace and happiness for herself.
Probably this is going to get lost in the comment section. Still i am telling you my opinion. I have never heard of you. Your video touched me. I don't care what people in the comments say. I am glad you found your true self and escaped from the situation you were in. Each of us has their own problems. The fact that people are moaning and saying that you have everything and that you shouldn't talk about problems is ridiculous to me. I bet most of the people(if not everyone) would be in the same position as you. I am just glad you had the guts to leave everything behind and find the real you. Every person has to deal with themselves sometime in their lives. I appreciate your honesty and i can relate to some parts of your story.  So i subscribed. Do what makes you happy and ignore these assholes in the comments.(But I am sure you know that already :D )
She doesn’t seek money, and she wanted to grow from her past. The beauty community should take notes from Michelle Phan.
its been a year since this video.
I miss you Michelle....Love you! 😘💗😭
Michelle :* if there is one thing i need to tell if we meet in person it would be :" You are the best healer in the world" just like your mother, you give people strength eventhough you're suffering life....  be back Positive smiling Michelle somedays ... i would wait and pray for you <3
Money can't buy you happiness.. but it buys comfort.
🍒She has a new video on Harper bazaar's youtube channel! 🍒
First time watching you i am crying now
the first video I watch of her and I got really touched.. I don’t even knew who she was and now I feel like I know her for a long time ...impressed ..
Thank you for your words, for your work and your purpose 
-myna
being able to watch this only now already made me feel how genuine she was w the past years. wish i knew her sooner. God bless your heart, you have inspired millions of people! soar high x
the only one thing i want to say..do not delete the videos that you posted on your channel.We're gonna miss you and by watching all of your vids is a pill for us.We love you mish! do and enjoy what ever you want because this is your journey.Create and make it as what you expected it to be.Just be what ever you want to be and live like a normal person that you've dream
I miss you can you come back and do an ultimate skin care routine! 🥺🥰✨✨
I miss you Michelle Phan ❤️
You should make tutorials on how to draw
I miss you Michelle Phan!
I cried, you always get me so emotional Michelle. I've been watching you for the past 7 years and this made as emotional as your Sailor Moon video. So glad to see you're building yourself up again. Life isn't a flat line, and it may seem hard to keep moving, but it only makes us better human beings. Love you. And good luck for you too!
We miss you Michelle!💔💜
Brah her Sailormoon makeup was everything.
God bless you forever
Can you imagine that all the YouTube's we watch now will end up like this in a few years
you have a beautiful soul Michelle
I miss you!! Can you update us??
True.. the way of success also making us become target.
We miss you, Michelle 😞❤️
this is taking 'draw my life' to a whole new level.
Hi Michelle, just seeing if you are ready to come back yet :) Hope you are well.
I can’t stop crying Michelle. I truly love you and I’m so sorry you went through all of this. I’m sorry I really am. I hope you are feeling better. You deserve so much more.
i love you and i miss you 😭❤️
I hope she living a good life right now and come back when she ready. I will watch this video  until one day  there’s a new one. I will wait to see and hear you. (Come back at March 29,2019)
I thought this was a video about why they left buzzfeed
MICHELLE ITS TIME TO COME BACK
Still waiting for U
I found myself rewatching this video, and I'm still crying. You're wonderful, Michelle. I hope you're doing well now.
I miss you so much 💔
You guys can disagree but also be respectful.
Her voice omgggg !!! It is so calming
Goodluck and God Bless Michelle...
Michelle is the original y'all! Shes the OG of makeup gurus. And she knew her stuff! Always classy too. Will always love and respect you Michelle! You inspired a 40 year old makeup artist of over 15 years.
Why did this hit me so hard omg
This video is so beautiful 💖👏
Why your story somewhat kind of reminds of the story in the book - The Monk who Sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma.
creating art is supposed to be fun, not because of the money
Welcome  back! 😘😍
I miss your voice, your art, your positivity, you....I miss you, Michelle. You were my go to beauty guru and the reason why I became a cosmetologist. You really helped me and when you said that you're going away, it upset me and many other fans of yours. I miss you....
THE LEGEND HAS SPOKEN
The queen beauty guru , she will never be replaced . It’s not the same without you 💕
Wow, this was so much more amazing then I thought it would be, glad i watched the whole thing.
Michelle, I started following you since your xanga days. I'm glad you left to grow. Youtube is not as cool at it use to be.
I miss u can you back make every body happy and look good
This is a try not cry challenge ☹️
Random checking my YT subscribed and saw Michelle’s videos..then I realized how beauty world has changed so much...And its all about the money. 😕
why am i trying so hard not to cry
What a wonderful soul 😍 thank you for all you shared with us. Wish you all the happiness in the world.
I MISS U PRINCESS NO NO QUEEN PHAN
great message!
We miss you come back please 💓
I miss this era  :(
Will she ever come back? 😭😭😔
omg! I don't know why am I crying so bad T.T
this may sound weird but her  voice is sooo nice to listen to
come back mish..
This is still  beautiful to me. I am so glad she is happy and peaceful.
We need her back!!
Whos here in 2019
I am absolutely appalled scrolling through the comments section. 

Mish, you have worked hard for everything you have today. Everything happens for a reason. You went through all you did to come out the other end. May you continue to grow. Thank you for sharing.

For people that didn't have anything nice to say, you will never find happiness or success if you hate on other people. To us it is just another make up but she CREATED it. You don't slate businesses for advertising themselves, why are you slating her? You don't even have to buy.
why u make me cry 🥳
What a true legend!
Soooo proud of you! 👑
We miss you so much michelle. The beauty community today is so toxic. I miss watching you, i miss being excited waiting for you to upload your vids.
This video has made me re-think all of my life choices
Love you, Michelle. 💜
Beautifull Goodbye 😘
I miss you 😘😭😢 come back!
I dont know why i wached this but i watched it complete and it was beautiful. good luck
August 2018 anyone??
5 years ago I remember that I was watching your Sailormoon make up tutorial .And I cried when I loose my Wi-Fi I'm still not done watching it yet but I always watching it since now😄😄
This still gives me chills. I so miss her so much 😭😭😭
Wish you have the happiness & growth that you look for I'm sure I will get better and better. ♥️
You are such an inspiration!
Looks likes she's coming back

Waits 4 months Soo uhhh looks like she's not
This..
Very touching..


I came from 2019, and this is the first vid that i watch from this channel
The only real beauty guru ✨
I hope you find your inspiration for new ideas one day, you are dearly missed to this day <3
Love how this video is exactly 11:11 :)
This made me cry..money does buy things but not happiness
i miss u. pls come back w us
That’s how she met Dominique Capraro
Michelle,
 I would always watch you when I was little, trying to make myself like you. Play with my moms makeup trying to look like your tutorials. You were the first YouTuber I watched. You have such a soothing voice and I miss you. Please please come back. Make videos with your family. 😭
WOW!! What a beautiful soul u r😇
God bless u
Por favor regresa pronto, eres la mejor... ♥
I miss you michelle, it's been a while 😔 I saw an ad of ur make up in fb. Congrats! Hope to see your videos soon ❤️
I'm going down memory lane. Just came from kevjumba's channel. Miss his videos. Now passing by michelle's channel reminiscing about the old YouTube.
When I was a kid, My parents told me to be my own person . That I could be anyone I wanted............
                          Obviously I wanted to be Batman .
I learned cat eye liquid eyeliner from her the summer after 5th grade. I'm 21 now. How sad ..
I can’t anymore I miss her so much 😭❤️
NOOOO COME BACK. it's been a year.
I come back after 9 years with Michelle
I missed you mish WE love you -your fans ❤
ちょくちょく日本のキャラクター出てきて嬉しい
I love this video... I always come here
Michelle I heard you met Swoozie
She was the first beauty guru I ever watched. Learned so much from Michelle!!
This is so authentic and beautiful. There are milions of broken souls, lost and lonely, waiting for this impulse that will show them the way. I will share this video, maybe it will help some of them.
2019 here watching you’re beautiful inside and out. Fly high and be happy.
Rest i  peace Michelle just heard the news
I miss you so much Michelle. I hope you find a way to come back to connect with us, even if it is once in a while.
I remember when my older sister showed me your channel. I loved everything about it and definitely miss the light you brought. I'm glad you are taking a break. That's good. :) You are missed.
Very touching, and also a good reminder for all of us to think are we doing things we love or others want for us.
miss you Michelle
this was awesome thank U
Hope you are doing fine Michelle x
This is such a beautiful video. I’m speechless. 👏🏿
I'm actually crying, this was so moving and beautifully done. SO much respect for you leaving everything you worked for to fight for your happiness. People get so caught up in work and success nowadays that they forget to take care of themselves, which should always come first. As Lilly Singh says, "Happiness is the only thing worth fighting for in your life" and I couldn't agree more.
This is one of the most inspiring videos I have ever seen. It was very brave of you to share this with us and I wish you the best of luck on your journey to happiness. I also struggled what to do with my life when I was heading to college. I thought money was the key to success and it took hitting rock bottom to realize all I want to do is be happy, do what I love, and love myself. Please take as long as you need to come back and know that you're truly a beautiful person; inside and out.
Mệt thì nghỉ , đừng biện lí do rất mệt 🙂
Is there a place where i can send Michelle Fan mail?  If anybody knows a physical address.  Even if she’s likely not to read my mail.
Found so much comfort in this video that I first watched in 2017, when it came out. I'm going through some tough times now, so this was what I needed. Love Mish so much <3
Came here from Tati's channel. Happy good old days ❤️ ♥️ ❤️
When I used to not be well known/everywhere especially at school or the internet (before I knew about YouTube, English or social media), I used to know who I am. In 2016 when I was interested on YouTube making and how YouTubers make videos, I made a YouTube channel called Cutemiming Ongachen but I stopped uploading there because I can’t sign in anymore. So in 2017 I made this channel (used to be called Cutemiming Ongachen Reacts, but I revealed my real name when I was ready probably March 2017) .But in mid 2017 (angst time) someone called me fat and stupid, almost broke my finger and hit me everyday when I’m in the way. I lost my social skills and I was antisocial for that period of time. At that same time, I made an Instagram and Snapchat (Snapchat: longachen3 IG:@randomkittysorandom). When I had cross country in mid 2017 aka angst time (because I had drama, bullying and sadness at that time) I was noticed and I never knew I was popular/well known. 2018 was a good year but I didn’t go to cross country because I was sick. I did have a YouTube problem that I don’t want to talk about because it makes me cry every time I tell that story of me uploading something on YouTube that could ruin my YouTube career. After a 3 months hiatus, I was back on YouTube again but went on another hiatus because I was graduating. In early 2018, I made a second account (@catsandlonblackhair) because I have long black hair and I like to post beauty related things. But in May 2018, it became Karma is a #$&*@ because even though people call me pretty, I started to lose weight and know I get complimented a lot on Instagram that I’m beautiful and at school too. My mum even told me that people look at me because of idk change. In late 2018, I made a Korean IG (@koreanloverfan) because I love kpop. I became popular from just having social media, YouTube channel and being everywhere. People even say that the reason why they like me is because I’m nice and I never knew that. Now I proved him wrong that I’m not fat or stupid because I really am NOT! People call me beautiful and smart and you can’t say that because it makes them feel dumb and ugly. But also, I don’t know who I am anymore, I don’t even know myself and I became insecure. I’m lost because I really don’t know if I have a personality or a purpose. That’s why I’m on another YouTube hiatus because I have a busy schedule and I have no content. Ever since 2018 I had been running out of content and constantly be on hiatuses because of this reason. I had became well known at school because know I have a YouTube channel and social media. Still to this day, I’m lost in who I am and my content. But I became popular for my dance videos because they got the most views. So I should be a dance and DIY channel because people like watching me dance and I like to dance and make art? I don’t know but I still need content to film. And when I became more popular in 2018, I started to be more social most likely after the time I almost ruined my career. I still don’t like looking back though. 
This is my story about how I became the popular kid. I even got bullied and dealt with drama and sadness at the time I became popular. How people know me but I don’t know myself.
Sorry if I wasted your time, I just need to spill the beans.
When will you come back？
Oh I still cry every time I watch this!
You are a queen who deserves all the success you receive!
I miss you!!!
Michelle, I truly hope you come to Christ. Jesus is not Michael but Jesus is the Son of God. All fall short of His glory, all of us sin. And sin separates us from the Father. But Jesus sacrificed so that we can have another chance. God said you will find me when you seek me all your heart. 
Prayer fasting celibacy love hope faith will take anyone to new heights, spiritual awareness, peace calmness, sincerity, love, health, renewal. Your name means Who is like God? The angels will gather the harvest. Michael is looking for those that practice and have mighty faith.
I remember watching when you lived with your mom and you made a facial out of egg whites lol thats when I subscribed, and then you showed how to make shoes more comfortable by putting ice cubes in them. I loved this video thanks for sharing :)
we need you come back
a u ready to come back
OMG! What the Hell? Come back mommy your the best makeup artist I ever seen. Wow! I have watched you since like 2010. Hope to see your pretty face again soon.  BTW I remember the Lady Ga GA wide video you made back then I liked that one. :)
True beauty queen.
Strength is not appearing to have power and masking perfection, but being vulnerable and being able to discuss your insecurities and hardest struggles. I think you are stronger than ever Michelle.
): my fav YouTuber ever! Come back !!
This is outstanding in every way.
<3 <3
I miss you 🤧🥺😭
I've been following you ever since I was a young girl. I always thought you were so lucky to have such amazing opprotunities to be successful and show your beauty. But I knew deep down, these things...they couldn't have given you the nutrition you need for your soul. And you have such a deep and kind soul, it was honestly quite a change you went through over the years. Sometimes you didn't even sound like yourself in your videos... But, I'm glad you made the decisions you did and turned to nature; sometimes that's what we need. I hope you're doing well now at least. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.
Love and miss you Michelle. Hope you’re happy with your life right now
I’m hardly the first person to say this but MICHELLE PLEASE COME BACK
Wow 😲 I have to say you must be a strong and honest person to say all of this. Money is a great servant but it’s not happiness.
I miss you so much...
i wish i could fly to switzerland to find myself again LMAOO
Will you ever come back?
I miss you..😭
your beautiful spirit is what inspires me the most
Still waiting for u Michelle
"money can buy you peace of mind, comfort and status but it doesnt buy you true happiness" what she said is absolutely true and she never once seemed ungrateful for all the money that she earned. She even mentioned that although it doesnt buy happiness, it buys her time to travel and what not. I dont understand why so many people are saying mean comments about this. She has this much money because she WORKED SO HARD, and she obviously appreciates what she has, she was able to retire her mom, buy her family a new house through her OWN hard work. But that doesnt equate to TRUE, Internal happiness. I'm proud of her for stepping away and doing what it healthiest and best for her. Good on you <3
I'm in the same boat as you are though not as successful as you. I want to take a pause and chase my other dreams. And I'm so glad Im doing it.
respect 💕
i miss you so much :)
I think that you should go back to how you started on youtube. No big team behind the scenes, nobody else's ideas, just that girl named Michelle who we loved to watch so much and who taught us how to make ourselves more beautiful. Just Michelle, the camera, and the video editing software. You were the first person who taught me how to put on makeup back when I was 14, and now I'm 20 with a continuous love for makeup and I'm even thinking about becoming an MUA. So....you've gone back to your roots in the world to discover who you really are, now it's time to go back to your roots on youtube.
such a beautiful story!
This is beauful from the inside out ❤️
Is she and Dominique still together ?
Bruhh where’d Michelle go? The queen of the beauty community, please 😭 come back😖😖
2019 January 1st... We're waiting for your return to the social media.  We Miss you... We miss the positive energy you used to fill in our hearts... We miss the sweetest smile of our Big Sister who helps us to get ready as A Princess in our memorable occasions. We miss our dearest friend who gives us courage and inspiration when we feel everything wrong. We don't know how many years it's gonna take to see You again but we hope You are doing well and living happy with prosperous lifestyle. And we'll keep on waiting to see our Sister... With lots and loads of affection. Wishes from India...
The first youtuber make- up guru ive ever watched!  I even look like her  haahaa ! Well they said ;)
Miss you love
I miss you 😞..
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU STOPPED YOUTUBE ACTIVITY XX. I LOVE YOUR VIDEO. I HOPE RETURN ASAP Michelle!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU REALLY REALLY GREAT VIDEO!!!!
Dearest Michelle:
I have never wrote a public comment and don't know if this will reach you, but I have been following you since you made youtube videos in your bathroom with drug store makeup and want to share my support!
I am sure I don't have to tell you to not take the mean comments to heart but I will offer you my genuine support. I know the feeling of pursuing someone else's dream and losing a sense of who you are as a person. The hardest thing in life is not only to find something you love but to love yourself. You taught me self-love when I was a teenager trying to figure out how to feel beautiful and loved and accepted. For me, seeing how amazing you are while you were so true to yourself was what gave me confidence to be myself. I will always remember those "nerdy" anime transformations that you did because I remember thinking, "wow, if Michelle can do this here on youtube, I shouldn't be afraid to be who I am and love what I love". 
People think money solves all problems but it doesn't. Keep doing what you love, and be who you are. You have no idea how many young lives you have touched and changed. You not only taught me how to bring out my best (asian) features (and not look to impossible standards) but to love all of who I am and THAT is powerful. I always told my family, if I was to leave the earth, I want to leave it better than I found it. Even if i only changed one life for the better and I DID something to help then that is enough for me. 
Truthfully, I have not owned any makeup from your line but I have been a fan of your personality and soul. I love seeing you back, I love that you took time to be true to yourself and find your own inner peace. People who need to put others down are unhappy themselves and that is not a reflection on you but of them. You go girl, you are an inspiration and strong woman. 
Sincerely, 
Erica
You will forever be the first, the original, and still, the most different. You are still inspiring through your videos. We miss you.
YOU WERE MY FAVORITE MAKE UP YOUTUBER
that was beautiful!
I miss you :(( you were and will be my favourite make-up youtuber. Other than james charles
I miss the early days of youtube.
Years and years I was sooo busy but I was looking through my subscriptions and I found you I thought why not watch some of your make up vids but I found this and I remember the memories of watching your makeup vids at a young age. I miss you so much! 💕😭
I miss you Michelle I hope you are happy xx
Please come back😢💫
can u come back
We miss you 😢😞😩
I’ve known you for 6 years now. I really miss you
日本の伝説を作った方
Hope Michelle is okay, these big corporations are ruthless
When will you be back  :(
I'm so disappointed by the comments that completely disregards the pain and sadness Michelle went through by comparing their own struggles to hers. Everyone essentially faces their own battle but by degrading someone else's pain helps neither you or the other persons fight. Let's build each other up rather then tear each other down.
I came back here again and cry. Why am I doing this to myself 😭😭. Michelle Phan. I miss you 😭
Omg 😭😭heart touching
im back. i'm still waiting for you, girl. please.. come back
Come back😭
This should be trending!!!
I feel like I’m going to cry I miss her so much.
Just say you got bored of youtube
You are spiritual now aren't you dear Michelle? Love
oooo I miss michelle.
Can people just stop?! Yeah okay, I get it not everyone can run away to Switzerland and "find themselves" and some people do believe that money brings happiness. BUT THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH GIVE HER A BREAK!  SO WHAT IF SHE PROMOTED HER MAKEUP LINE! SHE'S TRYING SO HARD TO MAKE ALL OF YOU "FANS" HAPPY. AND SO WHAT IF SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT SHE DID SOMETHING SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO DO AND WANTS YOUR SUPPORT ON! SHE DESERVES IT! 
p.s. obviously not for everyone just the people that say that she's just trying to get attention for her company and does not mean any of this
we love you. 🖤
I just found you today, but I’m crying because everything you said has been so relatable in my life. 😫 I hope you find your truth and eventually come back to YouTube to show us the new you 🖤
This made me cry at 1AM
Michelle Pham is forever the ORIGINAL BEAUTY QUEEN. She’s the reason why I created a YouTube account and I believe she was the first channel I subscribed to and I learned how to do my makeup because of her! I was 11 I believe! Take all the time to breathe Michelle! This YouTube is full of drama and negativity, you’re better than all that. One day, YouTube will be like it was. One day! We love you! Bless your spiritual path you’re on right now❤️❤️❤️
These people in the comment section complaining about her complaining about the money and saying " i dont see a problem there" or saying "You should be thankful you got money because when i growed up i suffered..." All im going to sayis that she didnt get born in money, she fought for the success and she did put her entire mind and energy into being successful and this caused her to forget what she truly needed which is happiness. Money cant give you happiness and thats all she wanted to share with us. You all here complaining just care about the money and are all hurt because she doesnt want the money but she wants happiness.Simply go off her video and leave her alone,simple. Jealousy wont make you haters any happier if you want money just fight for it how she did but dont be here disagreeing on her own experince because all she wants to say is that if you concentrate too much on your success you will end up sad and unhappy.
i swear im crying ranow
Michelle is the og beauty queen
I miss you!💔
I love Michelle's tutorials & am sad she went through such sadness.  I hope she's truly happy now.  She's awesome!!!
This was very deep. I'm so sorry for you. You are not alone! We will always be here for you! We will support you! You are wonderful!💜✨👍🏻
This cartoon is brilliant🔥. Thank you for being transparent and sharing your story🙏🙏
Dear Michelle, I remember you from early youtube videos. Hope that you're on the right path and are more happy now. Good luck! God speed! Wish you lots of happiness!
I came back to this video because I really miss you michelle 😢 I miss you alot 😢💕💞💓💗💖💘💝 I just wanna cry watching this video 😢 Iloveyou michelle , Iloveyou 😔💕💞💓💗💖💘💝📌📎
come back love we miss you
So when she was gone, people kept asking her to come back wondering where she was. And as soon as she drops a video, all people can do is COMPLAIN. Maybe this is exactly why she left in the first place. ok sure, we get it. money definitely helps when trying to achieve happiness. yes, she had money to fly to Switzerland for a year while the average person doesn't have the luxury of doing that. but that's no reason to undermine the struggles she went through just because you don't have that luxury. keep in mind that this is HER experience. not yours. Even though she had money, her experience is relatable in the sense that she dealt with depression, self-doubt, low confidence, hate comments, watching her parents fight, wanting the best for her parents, putting others first before herself, losing who you are in the process of growing up or going after a dream that is no longer recognizable. every experience is different. so is her's. this is her story to tell. so be mindful and just listen.
Sis are you coming back?! We miss u!!!!!
Michelle Phan was one of the kindest, most generous makeup artists on YouTube. Ever since she left, it's gone downhill. :'(
Will she ever be back? I miss her
I WANT HER TO COME BACK!
I will never forget you..... I love you! So much......
We need more like here not like James charles
Iwe will wait dont forget us
it makes me sad that she wasn’t fully happy while filming this
Who else came from the why I left video?
She's been gone for so long 😢
Another youtuber I'll miss. 😢
I know she hasnt been uploading much lately, but thats okay. Michelle needs a break too. And if she comes back, we will be there for her❤️
after watching her latest video "why I left" and then going back to see this...you can see she just wasn't into it and how far she was from where she started. Poor girl, hope she's found her happiness
she is not as active as she used to be anymore. h'm...
you guys seriously need to calm the hell down. I get you're anxious that she hasn't made videos and that you miss her but she needs to live her life, her life isn't just YouTube she has 4 businesses that she runs plus she's making Helios. she deserves her vacation, she deserves time off to get more inspiration for videos. she isn't kidnapped, she isn't in trouble. you're being selfish by continuing to tell her to come back, let her rest her life isn't revolved around youtube.
when i first saw the title and thumbnail i thought it meant removing thr hair on your head 😂
It's been 3 months 😩. And nearly a year since the last makeup tutorial💔. What happened 💦
It's been 2 months please come back
It's been two freaking months, where she at?
Wow, she does seem less lively than before. I'm glad she was able to take a break and grow as a person :)
Why doesn't she make videos anymore?
I've been watching you since I was 14 and I really miss you! Feels like you were my best friend and now I have no idea what you're up to. I would just like a glimpse into your life, like what fun things you've been up to or obstacles your facing, idk something that feels more personal. Don't get me wrong though I love the trend report videos and ' mastering the art of..'. I'm just missing my old YouTuber friend Michelle
woah, 2 months without posting? i miss her so much😞
Are you alive?
I literally feel like I'm watching a 4 minute commercial 😂😂
Girl where are you tho ya know I'm thirsty for ya vids
Michelle it's been three months, where are you?
not seeing you for ages. Where have you been Michelle?
Now that I'm looking back at her vids, she does look pretty unhappy...glad you've finally found urself ❤
Am I the only one that misses the makeup-related videos that actually have her in it???
Where did you go??? I miss your videos 😩😩😩
I miss your videos. I miss you
No more old stuff. I am so sad now.. Did you quit YouTube now?
I miss you 😞 I miss your make up tutorial and skin care tips.
Can u bring back the old Michelle with some makeup tutorials😁
it's been so long since she last post
Wtf Michelle it's already December where are you....;(
I came back from her why I left video feeling very sad
Missing you Michelle <3 ;_; hope to hear from you soon
You were the first makup guru I ever watched back in 2009 and because of you, I fell in love with makeup (and knew from a young age to fill in my brows!)

Slowly losing your fan base... what a shame, we miss the old Michelle! :(

It is a pity that the better ones are so painful
Does she not do YouTube full time anymore? Mish, is miss your videos!

Michelle, I am a huge fan of your videos. I know you have big promotions, business work and other things, but is it possible to bring back some of the Make-up tutorials? they were the best and I miss them alot... But I still love your videos!
I hope she's ok...
Michelle, what happened to your makeup tutorials?

I've been waiting forever for a new vid :(
missing your videos Michelle ❤
where are you Michelle Phan?  Missing your videos 😥
Yes I've needed this 😍
Michelle! we miss you. why arent you uploading videos anymore?
I'm waited for a long time but why isn't michelle posting videos anymore?
when r u gonna make a new video?
where are you?? missing you!
If you're getting laser make sure you find a trustworthy technician. I've had laser done by a beautician with her own studio and she was very honest and fair in her counselling. I wanted to try somewhere else (hoping for cheaper prices) for touch ups and ended up with a company that tried to force me into and overpriced contract and tried to make me feel bad about my body to sell more of their products. I didn't sign anything and got out of there as quickly as possible which they made fairly hard. Don't trust anyone who won't provide information over the phone. If they tell you that laser removes everything forever in any area of the body. No, that is a lie.
After watching her new video, I realize how forced this seems compared to what her videos used to look like. We're here to support you Michelle! XoXo
Is she done being a YouTuber? 😔 3 months no post
michelle we need your halloween videos😭😢
The beauty community is lost without you Michelle! Please come back and upload :(
Is Michelle Phan just sponsored videos now?
3 months??? where is she? Hope she uploads soon
makes me kinda sad her last beauty video was posted on my birthday but im happy that she found her happiness now 💜
Idk if you guys follow her on instagram but she wrote this 8 weeks ago: 

I miss you dreamers ✨ I know I have not been updating as much, but there is always a reason behind every action. I've taken some personal time off to fulfill a personal quest. I've been creating content online since I was a teenager. Since then, it's been a nonstop adventure filled with ups and downs. I don't share much of my downs, because, well...we're all going through our own battles. Some of us find victories, others don't. Regardless, the scars that inflict us molds us to who we need to be. To grow and become stronger for what's to come. I'm in a chrysalis stage in my life. When I come back, I hope to be transformed to share what I've learned. Sending you all elevated light during these dark times. I hope you find your inner strength like Rhea here. 🔥 p.s I've been working on a side project that I've been passionate about since I was a child.

if you think about it , every youtuber that we once used to watch when we were younger , is growing up. Eventually they will give up and get tired and get too busy to film . Youtube is not the same at all. it’s all about the money and fame . Youtube used to be just a platform where you could upload videos for fun . Now it’s about money and fueds and rumors and “tea”
She's been gone for so long! 😢
Upload please! We all miss you and it has been 2 months!
2 months ago... :( michelle pleaseee post
where'd she go?
Mastering the art of braids!!! Please Mish 💜💜💜
Michelle? Where are you? I miss you! a..lot...
Please don't give up...!
michelle phan's last vid was 4 months ago? whats going on man?
you are so busy with your career now. its already 2 months but still you haven't uploaded a new video. 😢 please remember that you started your career here in youtube. so pls dont forget us.
How to avoid ingrown hair though ?
Does anyone know if she does YouTube anymore it's been so long?
Two months to make a video????
when is Michelle going to make another video
The Avatar
Master of all 4 beauty elements 
Makeup
Hair
Fashion
Nails
But when the community needed her most
She vanished
i love ur calming personality😍
I feel like she should have at least considered  posting a video for "closure" with her YouTube fans if she was going to be disconnected for this long.
Dear Michelle,
Wherever you are and whatever you're dealing with now.. May God be there for you.. Good vibes and prayers are sent for you and family.
Love you💜💚❤️💙💛❤️
Athena.
Dear Michelle, WHERE ARE YOU.😭😢😭😥😭😭😥😭😭😭😭😭. I'm empty without you 😭
Sugaring is the best in my opinion
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN DUDE I'VE BEEN WAITING SICK LONG ;-;
I used to be a big fan of you and your makeup tutorials , I always found that you made the best videos but not anymore , sadly..too much success killed you...unsubd
Really miss your videos.
Hi Michelle, 

I know you're a busy person, but I just miss you! my mom and I just really love watching your videos. So if you have time please please update us with any vids.. that will do for me.. 😊
where r u michelle we r missing u very badly
For some reason I thought this video was about hair color removal
K just forget about all the people who support you and don't make any videos.
I know Michelle you are travelling many areas to achieve more and more knowledge about beauty according to different cultures and so on. I am really excited for the day when you will be starting to share your experiences with us.
I miss you, Michelle :(

but you do deserve a break. Take ad long as you need. I'll just binge watch your videos in the meantime. :D
I miss your videos Michelle, every time I visit your channel there isn't a new video😕
Does anyone also have the problem with dark underarms? v_v"
Michelle!! Where are you?! We miss you!
I constantly check in to see if there are any new videos. Nope. What happened
I wish michelle would post more often and more makeup related videos and tutorials. I love her so much but her content is getting weak and making me not want to watch her videos anymore. it's sad because I love her personality and her advice, but I don't get that with her videos anymore :' (
look on her Twitter guys she will tell you guys why she won't consistently upload on here anymore.
6 weeks lmao my hair grows fully after 4-6 days 😂
I hope the next video you make , whenever it is , a chit chat one . Like a life update one . Can anyone tell me of Michelle is on snaochat ?!
Just came from the recent life changing video. I'm so glad I found what she described.
I'll miss you.  Definitely miss her old videos too. I feel like all the og YouTubers are calling quits this year.
Ik you are busy and everything but it would be nice if you could at least let your fans know when you will be going on hiatus so we aren't sitting here wondering what happened to you. We all love your videos and I think it would be appreciated if you could give us a heads up before you leave and maybe let us know when you'll be back to upload if you before hand. 

P.s don't read this in a hateful voice, I'm only writing from love not hate. 
thank you :)
Hi Michelle! It's good to be offline. Then you can take a breath, and just enjoy life. Oh, the irony of this comment!
I love you Michelle! I miss watching your creativity on YouTube. Hope you post more! God Bless!!!!

Maybe she just needs some time to focus on her life instead of YouTube. And if so we should respect her wishes.
I literally thought I somehow I subscribed from her I haven't seen her videos in forever
where are youuu? :(
I miss the old Michelle, you know the one who did makeup tutorials. Your last makeup tutorial was 8 months ago
Waiting on new makeup tutorials ❤️

I didn't know that a new chapter meant barely uploading and no more makeup tutorials
I liked her when her videos were more personall not like commercials
I miss you so much😫🙌🏽✊🏽👏🏽I hope yr healing journey sets you on yr true path✊🏽
Towards the end I feel like is gets more and more expensive. I'll just stick to shaving!
Miss you Michelle <3

Michelle please come back 😭 I miss you, you were keeping me alive and now you're not here anymore please come back
hey Michelle!
You haven't uploaded in a while, and apparently you shared the reason on other social medias, but could you please explain it here, too? It's all good, if you can't or don't want to upload all the time any more then it's completely understandable, but please tell your audience (here - not somewhere else).
XoXo
Hair removal is such a chooooore but the results make me feel fabulous so yeah hahahaha

Where are you Michelle :( I want to see your videos
Michelle, no video, no new posts on instagram, please post a photo or anything we miss you :)
I'm at a loss when it comes to body hair, I usually have to wax every two weeks, epilating the hair comes back as if I've shaved (I think the epilator just snaps the hair) and shaving I can't have a full day of smoothness! 
wish I could afford permanent solutions!
We miss you!! <3 <3
I miss you Michelle Phan.

Are michelle and Dominic still together?
rip this channel
I wish we didn't have to shave our hair😩I hate being tall cuz it makes it harder
Your videos are getting more and more rubbish, plus, that bitchy tumblr attitude is unbearable. And doing a video every three months? You're a big disappointment Michelle. I'll be one of your unfollowers
mishy! can you please make a video with unique eyeliners? there are so many videos and pictures on instagram that i just have to see you make a video about it!! xoxo
thank you for all of the information. it was really nice to know
Damn, she abandoned YouTube, the thing that made her famous.
It is so hard to be hairy. I'm super hairy; arms, legs, armpits, mustache, name it. I'm super lazy, so I only maintain my brows and mustache because they're the only ones always visible. I choose not to wear sleeveless and shorts because of my hairyness and laziness, but on occassions, but when I have to, I need to be notified days before so that I can prepare. IT'S SO HARD! 😭
Hi Michelle! 

I have seen your videos since you were just starting and I love you so much I like a lot the way you care about all of you fans. You're not like all the others girls that just post makeup videos, you're gorgeous and you make me feel ok with myself and no just ok you make me love myself. I don't even know if you're going to read this but whereva. 

By the way I'm from Colombia so sorry for the bad English, lovu
We miss you mich!! :(
Thats the epilator i have! Love that lil thing!

The hair creams never work.

shaving is a quivk method but you hair will grow the next day depending how professional you shave but even if you master the arts of shaving it will grow the next day.

Epilating is rubbish and only lasts for a week plus you have a higher risk tgen any other method of getting "Ingrown hairs!" also it doesn't i repeat "It doesn't" pluck all your hairs from the follicles it mostles trims the hair and makes you really itchy.

Sugar waxing is shit it doesn't take any of your hairs off and its sticks to you skin like glue and takes you forever to get it off your skin.

Threading hardly works and always gives you ingrown hairs.


Laser Hair Removal reduces the hair by 70% it is a perminant "Reducing" solution.

Electrolysis is a more effective then laser hair removal as it removes the hair by inserting special needles into each follicle and killing the follicle from inside it is extremely painful 10x more painful then laser hair removal.


I recommend getting Laser Hair Removal first so your hair is 70% reduced and then getting electrolysis for those tough hairs that the laser hair removal couldnt get rid off
I have so much respect in you. You are so intelligent, determined, thoughtful and loving, a true inspiration. I'm sure I speak for everybody when I say that we miss you and we hope you'd do your videos more often! Best regards
epilators are sooo painful!!!!
Im 9 years and i have a LOT of mini hair in my legs, arms evry thing😢😢😢😣😣
Erm you forgot a type of hair removal....electric lady shavers
I could just listen to her talking for hourss...
Please post video. I missed you!

I missed her so much. Please come back 😔😔
the thumbnail made me think the video was about hair color removal lol
3Months😔
I used to love watching your makeup tutorials years ago, and especially around this time of year could count on some truly amazing halloween transformation tutorials. Your channel has completely changed and no longer feels creative. I feel like you have lost sight of what gave you so many fans and subscribers in the first place
where are u 😭
We miss you!!!! cries confidently cause mascara is waterproof

Congratulations 🎉🎈🎊🍾 on your success!
Michelle we love you! Keep sharing natural beauty tips and club looks! Xo!

Nice I have the exact same epilator
PLEASE UPLOAD I MISS YOU SM
Hi Michelle! Just wanted to let you know that I miss you, but I understand if you have't posted in a while; you have a life, and you're disconnecting from social media, which is something admirable considering that we live in a techy world! Aside from that, I hope everything is going well for you. :) And I really want to see another pillowtalk video from you, perhaps about how disconnecting from social media is beneficial and how to deal with rumors at work or school? Or a fall look? 
Love you mish! :)
could you pls start talking about politics
i miss you michelle :')

MICHELLE PHAN WHERE ARE YOU!?!? IT'S BEEN 4 MONTHS we miss you <3 <3 <3
your book is amazing please make more it's the best web toons you have also glad your branching out
I missed you Mish. <3
Why doesn't She post anymore?
Pls do a video of u singing!! 😄
OK i have been watching Michelle Phan since I was 10 years old, no joke. I always loved how she didn't just focus on her skin tone but tries to incorporate everyone in her products. I love how she honestly gives her opinion and never showed the people that tried to put her down all the time how she felt about them and stayed positive. I think every girl of every ethnicity should watch you because you truly make everyone feel accepted in their own skin. Love you girl, keep doing you.
michelle uploadddd

You should do a home decor haul on your next video, or another makeup tutorial.
Go watch her recent video...i...i...i don't know what to assume is she gone or coming back??
Boo. Make a makeup tutorial.
Michelle! I LOVE LOVE LOVEEE your webtoon helios femina! The story and visuals are so amazing. One of my favourite comics!
Who else is convinced that Ash kidnaped her? Also, any Helios Famina fans out there? I am in LOVE with that amazing comic lmao.
Michelle! I miss you 😭

 months
I miss you michelle, I miss you so much. I can't believe myself!
More videos please Michelle 😢
MICHELLE WYA
Michelle, where are you now?! 😂
Gosh, Michelle, I miss you. I know there are tons of makeup artists on YouTube. And a lot of them are truly amazing, some of them are completely professional and even more experienced being in the industry for decades and I love watching them. But there is just something about YOU, your style, your editing, your voice and your message that just makes you THAT special to me. I just hope to see more of you soon. I know you are a busy business woman. No pressure here. I am not one of those crazy fans who would say that subs made you who you are now.  Because we didn't. YOU did. You are the one who made us love your work. We supported you. But you were the one who worked for it. And I just loved that about you. Your dedication and your creativity. There just used to always be something so exciting when you posted your videos. Especially the holiday looks and ideas. I've tried so many of them. And I miss that excitement that you provoked in all of us. I just love you. Even if I have never met you, but you truly are an inspiration. I hope you are well and hope to see you soon here. Sending you my best wishes. I hope you read this someday ❤
yeahhhh middle east comment saudi if ur from middle east
I always look at the video! Please do its best from now on!

いつも動画見てます！これからも頑張ってください！
Hi Michelle I wanted to know if you are still dating Dom?
xin chao tuyet bang phan
I really miss the makeup tutorials :C
something..make her face weird in this video. i dont know what..something is odd..
Hey mish you inspire everyone , your the greatest youtuber!! Can u plz start posting more videos. All of your fans are missing u😊 Thank You💖😊
I'm confused.
I thought this was a makeup channel.
Last time I was on here, I only saw makeup videos. Now it's more of a basic YouTube channel.
This video used to be private 
not anymore
Do some trend reports!!!!!!!
Michelle I am your biggest fan!!!!! I did all your makeup tutorials and I really want to meet you😊😊
plucks femstache while watching the video
Don't worry read the description
So Michelle just chooses to get rich and then stop making videos… OK
It's been so long since a new video 😕😔
I miss youuu michelle
A long break for a yt chanel.  Don't said bye.
We need more tutorials but with ELF, NYX, Maybeline, etc 
 We don't have Lâncome, Guerlain, Armani, Chanel, Dior... Back to the basics Michelle.
I'm following...Emily Noel83 bc she always do videos with the best new inexpensive brands and teaching a great makeups.
Here in my country the girl that are making a huge success on YT calls CoolMarina. She have a video séries calls: Poor with style. She is cute, pretty, intelligent and have a amazing sense of humor. She always test the best cheap products in the market and just do a video if the product works well.  Emily and Marina deserve hers success.
This is what I calls the real makeup artists. I miss the old Michelle. My first "guru" on YT. Oh, and I'm not younger...I'm 57 now.
Hugs from Brazil
Michelle is like my dream best friend XD
i miss u so much !!!!!
DO A NIGHT ROUTINE
please upload more videos
Electrolysis looks painful!!! I didn't know about that option before watching your video. I has laser hair removal done last year and I love the results!
I'm allergic to Nair :(
After watching "Why i left" I can see and hear how unhappy she was in the new videos vs back in the day. Wishing her the best.

Micheeeelllee come baaaaaack! miss your videos!!
I miss you mish
I miss Dom:(
dafuq??? i thought it was like few weeks?????!!!
Michelle, I just love you! Your videos were what inspired me to start experimenting with makeup in the first place. As I grew more confident, I knew I could always fall back on your videos for advice and inspiration I'm so glad that you've branched out into videos like this, because they offer great practical information from a source I can trust! <3 Keep doing you girl!
Girl we miss you, you have been so absent lately....
Hi Michelle Phan,
I want to ask can you making lipstick that kinda orange brown and a foundation stick

I miss your videos so much

i so pround of you  because i a vietnamese
I will miss her. I also think there is no more reason to subscribe since I feel like there is nothing to look forward to her youtube page. Maybe I will just buy your products. good luck to your corporate life!
It's been 3 months since her last upload omg 😐
4 months ohmy. where is michelle 😭
This helps a lot
What if she died guys

But I do miss her
Does she pay people to do these demonstrations? 😳 so informative!
Hi!!! Please do Harley Quinn makeup!!!

U just wonder.
Only epilator or electrolysis or leaser would give me a cleaner look for a month i guess.... waxing have never removed my hair from roots n shaving oh please!.... my hair grows back super fast.....
Come back Michelle , come back!
she was legendary.
I've been watching michelle's videos back as long as i can remember, and i've found her channel again. Im surprised to see how much she has grown on youtube. Since i started watching her 5 years ago, i've never subbed for some reason. But now i have a youtube channel, i can finally subscribe.😊
Mish! Please do a hygiene video
Hey Michelle! Are you creating a new makeup line for EM? Are you making a BB cream too? I really love the BB cream from EM but it's discontinued :( it's was so light, not heavy like most bb creams.

you know, everyone sounds so pissy in the comments. I love Michelle's videos.
She's one of the OGs of YouTube saying she's been here for a long time & look at her now!
I can see where everyone is coming from, wanting another makeup tutorial but imo, these other videos are actually great & helpful. I love her trend reports bc they keep ME updated.
I also actually like how professional her videos are. they look good
where are you Michelle

My Queen is back!!!!!!
anyone else feel like Michelle has been MIA? like she rarely uploads videos anymore, maybe like once a month she uploads. And they're always just short little videos. I actually thought I'd accidentally unsubscribed from her bc I hadn't been seeing any activity from her channel
I miss Michelle, she hasn't posted a video for 3 months, I never she her post anything on social media and now there are no updates from her webtoon 😢😭 (she said in october that she would be on a small hiatus until november but november is almost over now 😖)
I have tried the sugaring. IT DOES WORK! However, I recommend a thermometer to get the right temp exact! It wasn't for me because my skin wasn't a fan and I'm very sensitive. However it does work and can be done!:)
Hi Michelle ! I've seen your videos on beauty tips...i wanted to know, how do i get rid of scars after popping a pimple ? There is a spot, after popping it...I really want to get rid of it at all cost.

She barely POST anymore since she got more famous
Where is Michelle? I miss her videos :(
where are you michelle?
Why isn't she active anymore ? I miss her vids
3 months without a new video... wow, pushing your fans to the absolut limit
Your makeup is really great!
I think she is busy with her Webtoon Helios femina and that's why she's gone for so long. If you look at the artwork you should understand why she's taking a break from social media because it takes soooooooo long to draw all that. But it's an amazing story so I recommend everyone to read it! ☺️☺️
you will find out who I am
its been 4 months and no more videos??? ...😩😩
Where are you I miss you wtf
it became 3 monts please come bach
these are more like adverts ...😐
that was a 4mins + commercial...i feel extremely disappointed to have come back to this channel with high hopes. nvm.
I'm a guy and I don't give a shit about all this stuff but I watched the entire video because your voice sounds like an angel.
Neu co kem cao rau cao se ko bi rat ... con ko dau lam
Women don't have to remove thier haur or feel like they need to to feel like they need to uphold a certain image.
i miss michelle so much....she was the one that got me into makeup when i was like 12 or 13 (even though i wasnt allowed to wear it at the time). i just want her to do more tutorials or come back
ummm are we supposed to remove hair on our arms?? lol
I can't believe your gone for so long I miss your old videos from your very first room I learnt to do my make up because you I will always have you as my Make Up IDOL !!!
Where is Michelle it has been 2 months?!?
Does anyone know what she uses to edit?

I miss you
Happy Birthday! It's today right?
Thank you!
i miss the old michelle. i used to love her. she inspired me to study more because of her story,. i've watched all her videos. I MEAN SERIOUS LEGIT. even i have her book.. but now, i just miss watching her in her old videos, the fun DIY videos...
she does not post vids anymore either... that's why, i missed her already...
she hasn't posted in 4 months!!!! i know she is traveling but 4 months is a long time. and she promised that she would be making more makeup tutorials than before but she hasn't uploaded one of those in over a year.
AAAAAAAAA I MISS HER SO MUCH☹️
I think you look great.  Are you half African-American?
A shame she did not mention options for intimate hair removal.
Do a trend report!! 🙌🙌💕💕
Subscribed because of her second name.
Un mes y con este video sales ???

I miss u mish....:(
I really miss your videos. You´re such an inspiration for me and I would just like to know if you have stopped making them or if you just upload them every other month or so. Please connect with us because you´re great
y is this so soothing.. must be your voice
Please
oops
Michelle you have a beautiful laugh
Am I looking at a mannequin 3:53 😂
if you scroll down almost to the bottom of the comments she has replied to the earlier  comments asking where she is , she said she is just taking a break for a while
I miss the old Michelle Phan..
Heyyy Michelle, may I suggest a Helios:Femina inspired make-up tutorial? I just read your webtoon and the aesthetics are SIMPLY STUNNING. Please?? 😚
the makeup youtuber who doesnt create youtube videos anymore much less makeup tutorials
I used an epilator once... NEVER AGAIN! >_<
YouTube without you is nothing :(
What happened with domnique???
That was I'm my birthday
Im here for yuyaaa xd
where r u Mish :(
Yuya te tiene Admiración 😺✨😍😊
For the dear life of me I will never wax my eyebrows ever again but discovered threading 7 years ago thank gawd, the results not only look better but lasts way longer than waxing.
Okay, the bad thing about the Nair body hair removal cream is that it makes your skin super itchy. It does it to my skin. So, it doesn't like sting or burn or hurt I don't think it just makes you so damn itchy. I don't know why.
Michelle Phan, Could You Maybe Give Shoutouts? It would be really cool, and inspire many people!! I'm of your biggest fans!! If you ever notice this, which you probably won't, but is you do... That would be a dream come true!! Love you Michelle Phan!!
why is it that when a YouTube hasn't posted in a while ppl jyst assume they are dead? FYI they are ppl as well and need rest like anyone. you would think it was stupid if ppl said you were dead if you hadn't posted in any of your social media social in a few months so why is it OK to say the same thing here?

you lot need to start THINKING before you start TYPING
No more michelle shes tired of youtube
Is it me, or Michelle seems less tan?
i lobe u Michelle !
You can see the sadness in her eyes, so glad she's found the truth and back at her real self again :)
is this new??
Why has she not posted anything for 2 months?
Okay so you can't YouTube often . Atleast snapchat?! Honestly your Instagram is so made up I can't follow you there . Looking through the Pictures gets my head spinning . Atleast snapchat to keep us updated . Cuz we actually miss you and want to be a part of your life .
where is she now any idea anyone....
video hay quá
She hadn't posted in monthes
Came back to this video after watching her recent one to see the comments about her disappearing
why hasn't she posted anything?
Michele have you quit Youtube?
Where did you go? :( Hope you are ok.
I just want to know if her and Dom are still together

Great video.  Didn't know how some of the methods worked.

Where is she, she haven't been uploading for ages... I don't understand:/
Were is she???😁
"Mastering the art of ... "?  I do believe that's name of Julia Child's cookbook. The heavy emphasis on being "creative" is not reflected well here.
That acc help so much thx

I really miss Michelle and how I used to feel very close to her I guess bcuz she shared with us her thoughts and idk maybe it's just me...
She should do a harley quinn toturial
3:01 those eyes 😍
She was so sad,  but sounds so happy. Just shows you how powerful a face “mask” can be
I do laser- depending on the strength it can hurt like crazy!
1 minute long advertisement??
I have my eye brows threaded if I'm short on money, otherwise they seem to come out better when I get them waxed. Threading is far less painful and there are no bumps or breakouts.
Michelle we miss you :( please come back. ..........
cri
Vine por Yuyita ❤
what do you think is better for your brows: waxing or threading?
I can tell what she meant by being a "Product" all these companies were paying her to say all this. Glad she found her self again :)
You don't post a lot of makeup. Videos to once a week now once a none
Do we need the cucumber?
Where is Michelle
Is she still with don? I hope so
I miss you..
I have PCOS and body hair is my worst nightmare. I'm nicknamed hurtful names such as Sasquatch, Bigfoot, or ape. I cover my body when I'm in public because I know they would stare if I reveal myself. I'm more hairier than my step-dad and brother combined. In fact, I'm more hairier than most men are. Ugh. I can't wait to get it all permanently removed.
Where did Michelle go?
Another youtuber I'll miss.
pls make videos I understand if you are busy
Please continue your season please
Laser is less painful than electrolysis? Hell no! I was almost crying, it hurts af! But it's worth the pain.
So, is this the Michelle Phan who did makeup years ago? If so, she looks... different.
Ou sont les françaises ?! :-)
Ur mien?
Where are you????
ヒカキンがミシェルファンの講演会に行ったと聞いて
Hi, i've been a fan since you started your channel on Youtube...but your videos are loosing more and more of that personal feel, just looks so corporate this days. I know that a youtuber have to evolve and upgrade and you also have to make a living but i don't even know if you're running your own channel anymore. I feel l'm not the only one here missing that Michael magic..
I think she doesn't update the channel so much so that the previous videos get more views. A lot of youtubers are losing views lately.
So this is the video that pushed her to the edge.
you dont upload anymore :(
Came back love ❤️💛🌹
i have very thin hair
is she korean?
You can tell she's not fully into this video.
does epilator hurt?
2019☹️
So umm, the vacation of Michelle took it too long. I bet she won't appear until january unless she comes back on december to do a "thank you" video about 2016. 😒
Chị ưi k có dịch tiếng việt ư
its makes me so sad that she was dead on the inside while filming this
Miauu!!
Amazing video
Another youtuber I'll miss.

How about mastering the art of creating a society that doesn't demonise female body hair. Seriously I am so over caring about body hair but at the same time I don't want the attention that growing body hair will bring. Tips anyone?
Come back ☹️ please
Mich, when I watched your latest video I want you to know that we don't want to see little miss perfect. We want you! There are no expectations for anyone. Not even you

Mish great video i have to say, but what about facial hair my dear? Thats a topic i watched so many videos about, but i cant seem to find something that would help for my very senitive skin😞

Is it just me that after a day of shaving my legs they start to itch really bad ?? HELP and I do everything properly
DEAR MICHELLE, I am a Bangladeshi. Actually I never visited ur website before. Truthly speaking I never liked u so much before as my frnds always praised about u. Bt the last night I suddenly visited it nd I found a heaven there. U r so much adorable nd some of ur videos made me cry. I am just thinking that how a girl can be so loving. Ur life draw video, love related videos was very close to my heart. Ur videos inspired me to live a even longer life. Now i just want to knw that , Do u still have relation with DOM? If u then I will be the happiest. And now I am just praying to the ALMIGHTY that to give me a chance to meet with u once in the whole lifetime. I just love u nd this love maintain no bounds of contents. I think my love will travell the whole world nd reach to ur  heart. I will consider u as my soul sister . Stay blessed nd remain that someones love is spreeding  for u from the opposite of the world. If u can then plz reply. Love uuuuuu.......  SOUL SISTER.........
is she dead
Where did she go
She looks different here....
Please,come back
Did she quit YouTube? I miss her :/
Did she actually quit YouTube?
there might be options but are there really any options when they don't work I mean from the cheapest that's very temporary to the most expensive that's long-lasting but still temporary so many options and there goes my wallet
Hey Michelle my lips are dark and i have tired everything plz help me
Did you forget that you gained love and popularity as makeup guru? Where are the makeup tutorials at?

Now that you're a multimillionaire thanks to OUR views and support, whatever right? Just continue  regurgitating beauty facts every video until everyone gets sick of that too and just stops watching you completely? 

Great.
Great video!
:(
is she still making videos
i miss the old old old videos if you know what I mean :/ but if you're happy with what you're doing right now , you do you :) don't have to listen to me, just some suggestions!  keep it up! :D
This girl made a bunch of money doing her  vids for us to watch , and now she's forgotten all about us. I can't wait until she says she's been too busy traveling the world , working on her manga character , she can't post anything . I feel so used .
I'm mini u
I think probably the reason why she doesn't post any makeup tutorials anymore or I can say for quite a long while, because besides she's busy, she just doesn't want to do what somebody elses are doing these days(makeup tutorials). with so many makeup gurus nowadays, probably she might think, if people wants to see makeup tutorials, they can find a hell lot of pro makeup tutorials on YouTube nowadays. So, she focuses more on self care/advice/tips instead? because that's what she is good at too besides makeup? And, it could be that she is starting to feel insecure by other makeup gurus. Well, probably not because, well, we know she's one of those earliest people on YouTube who did makeup tutorials before it was a ... I don't know how to say it, "a trend"? "a thing"? or just people starting to become more outspoken or more brave to do makeup tutorials or provide more selection to the viewers. but we don't know if she really feels that way. plus, we can see there are some people also who bash her ways of doing makeup tutorial. people are not always strong. so yeah, just an opinion/useless assumption. because I'm kinda sad when she stops doing makeup tutorials too. keep figuring out why.
IS SHE DEAD?
She forgot all about us, fans.......
I've watched your videos since before anyone knew who you were in the beauty community. You've been such a huge inspiration so please understand when I say PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put more effort into putting more videos out! I've been checking back every few days and can't help but feel disappointed!
No Halloween videos?? I miss seeing your beautiful face!
Why is no one saying a thing about her not posting a video for over 2 months!!!, that's lazy
Pls go back to your old styled videos!!
It's been 3 months, I'm unsubscribing in like 2 weeks
هاي
Miss her.
Were are you? you didn't post anything for like four months
did anyone else think she looked liked choji from naruto
4 month? Omg thats sad michelle
It's awful what she was going through she didn't want this!
Miss ya
Epilators hurt :(
Threading works REALLY well! I've done it a few times and I've been happy with the results. But for me it's torture. It's just awful, worse than tweezing.
WHERE ARE YOUUUUU?!!!
do NOT do laser hair removal on your period it is TERRIBLE
Like si vienes por YUYA 💕😂
No holloween looks?
And if you could do one or two halloween make-up tutorials I want to try something for halloween this year and not sure what. And if you could please give recommendations for halloween make-up would be great too. love your videos and GOOD LUCK!!!!!!
You know Michelle, you can't hide from YouTube forever your fans everybody is on your side,we will go through the problem together no need to be shy!!!
Does she broke up with her boyfriend?
she looks like sulli
Has she quit YouTube?
I miss her
For everyone saying that Michelle has abandoned her channel stop. She has a career, a business worth millions or even billions. Michelle doesn't need to do YouTube anymore and I don't think she even has the time to make videos anymore. This is reality; our favourite youtubers and beauty gurus aren't going to be on YouTube forever. It's sad, but we should be proud of Michelle, because of her success.
threading is actually from india
Estoy aquí por Yuya
Salu2
Michelle is the reason that I got in to makeup and now she never posts makeup videos anymore and haven't posted for ever. I know she has A life but she was such an inspiration to me and I just miss her old videos.
We need you , Michelle. Come back when you're ready.
Thanks for abandoning us 😔
Alguien mexicano???😭
What the he'll happen to her did she die 😑
Are we supposed to shave our arms? I never have but their so.... ew. And I want to get rid of the hair but I don't want to because I heard it grows back darker...
Hola linda!!! Quiero decirte que eres un amor, me encantan tus videos, me han ayudado mucho, tanto para sentirme bien conmigo misma, como para verme bien fisicamente, cuando estoy triste veo tus tutoriales y tu voz me hace sentir mas tranquila, gracias, aunque no nos conocemos te siento como una gran amiga, hari bol
It's seriously been 3 months since her last video ? Don't wanna be rude, but the few last ones weren't great, totally lost interest in following her...
How can you safely get rid of pubic hair and which method lasts the longest?
I miss her inspiring videos
Do you have makeup new videos ??
im glad my hair glows very slow and not prickly on my legs.
it makes me so sad to watch this video now that I know how unhappy she was at this time in her life. in her most recent video, she talks about how controlled her videos were and how there was nothing genuine about them at all. She compared herself to a product. So glad she decided to take a break to reconnect with herself :)
Yo
I know she has her own life, I just wish she could make videos more frequently /:
I hope u come back
did she quit YouTube.
Did you die Michelle? Don't you think it is too cruel to disappear like this? You have 8 million of us waiting for you, rooting for you. Remember Michelle, if we werent here supporting you, you wouldn't have a life that you have now. I am hurt Michelle, I really am
BRING BACK THE TREND REPORTS AT LEAST!
Yuya te admiraaaa (upss fui muy directa)😅
Where can I get the bleach?
I would love the see: Mastering the Art of Computer Editing
I know it's something different but I love to be creative!
I NEED a new makeup vid
it's been over a month
She use to be a top YouTube channel. Now it's on the verge of abandoning. Well this is what happens when a YouTube star becomes bigger than their channel. Screw the subscribers.
sad
Can you do the ride or die makeup tag? I know you normally don't do tags but I thought that you should do this one. It's actually a pretty good tag
She is famous and RICH. she does not have time for you guys anymore.
We miss you Mish!
Hey michelle. Halloween is coming up and I really hope you are doing some halloween related videos. I absolutely love your Halloween videos. Much love
What is your sisters name?
Is this chick dead?
How come you abandoned your fans
ugh where are the makeup videos??
Where is she ?
Where is she?
I feel like part of Michelle's YouTube failure is based off of the messy ideas and change of her channel. she should have stuck with cute tutorials.
https://www.sanrio.com/wish_lists/4e21a9e48dac
well this chanel is dead
RIP
Guys please don't put mean comments. She might be traveling over seas to collect more tips or blah. Or she might be taking a break. All you dummies saying she just abandoned us is stupid. She is a grown woman with her own life. Her life isn't all bout yt. Imagine she is making another video of her traveling and comes back to all these negative comments. Do think she will want to make more videos? Do you think she will feel good about her fans? The answer is no. Think about what you're gonna say and the aftermath.
Is she dead?
Michelle! You have to do a harley Quinn makeup tutorial pls!
You should do a Halloween makeup tutorial this year 😄 (specifically mermaid) 😜😜

Her hair looks like a sumo wrestler's butt
I've wounded myself once when I was shaving. It's painful even if it's just a small wound. I even still have the scar (looks like a mole). Since then, I've been afraid of using the razor so I simply stick to waxing and plucking. 😱
What happened to Dom? He's not here anymore (I'm new to her channel)
My mommy (don't judge me plz) shaved my armpits today. I keep touchibgvthem xD
Hais where are you mich? I miss your videos so so so so so much 😔😭💔

Love you so much Michelle! I have sensitive skin and I can never find a good razer! Can u give me some options ? Thanks 😘
I miss you Michelle ♥ :(
Michelle , it's been so great to see you grow into such s wonderful woman.  I have watched your videos from day 1. I didn't start wearing make up until I was older and I'm atleast 5 years older then you. Thank you for teaching me how to wear make up properly.  I must admit I haven't been watching your videos the last year due to the topics. They just don't apply to me but a younger audience.  Although I may not watch your videos anymore , I truly wish you the best and so happy with all you accomplished. We all go through different seasons in life and whichever season you may be going through, wishing you the BEST!  -from one of your OG subscribers!  haha!
Dear Mich, 

We miss you, please come back to us.

love, 
your subscribers
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS
Girl you haven't made a makeup tutorial in SEVEN MONTHS! The year is almost over and my creativity vibes from my favorite Boston-born girl are dying!

Could do a makeup tutorial of the Enchantress from Suicide Squad?
Your character in Avengers Academy came out :D
I'm hairy too the must part I hate to remove is underarms gosh worst place, at the beginning my older sisters helped me by removing it with sugar and they were completely UNPROFESSIONAL worst days of my life and my underarms became really dark but after using treatments and the must thing was useful is wax ( I went to PROFESSIONAL) to remove the hairs it turn back light again so personally I use wax for best result but go to PROFESSIONAL people or if you don't have time just use the epilator 🙌
anyone know why she is not uploading videos
Michelle can you do the art of hair removal for people who are starting out with that👍❤️❓

Heyy Michelle ❤️
Well, there was a time, when I used to cry at night. I used to watch all of your videos.
Then I came to know about your long distance relationship. I gained courage. I was totally broken but then, I was strong too. 

Today, I'm happy. I don't cry anymore at night. 
I really appreciate the efforts you put in your videos. I was encouraged by you, inspired from you. So, unknowingly you helped me a lot ❤️
thanks Michelle ❤️ 
I love your videos ❤️

Never wax over the same area twice!! Doing so could lift the skin and leave it irritated!! And do not wax or tweeze eyebrows too often or they become thinner over time and sometimes don't grow back to the original way!! BE VERY CAREFUL ladies and shaving is the safest option as long as youre careful and keep a sharp blade.
Why not use a permanent method to remove hair ? There is something called ant egg oil, ever heard of that ?
I tried this out and it seems to work, The hair growing back looks thinner and shorter but I guess I have to wait some weeks more to be completely sure if the results are permanent. I made a video about this ant egg oil if you are interested check the video out on my channel.
OMG i wish the unwanted hair just simply go away by magic. Beauty hurts :/
this channel has become the wiki how with BASIC info for everything which she calls "mastering".
You're channel inspired me to create mine, and I'm so thankful!
Just voted you for best beauty blog on bloglovin! I hope you win! 💘I will always support you, thank you for creating awesome videos for us!
btw love the fashion!!
Do a "mastering the art of photography"

Hi Michelle I'm new to YouTube and would like to know if you would ever do a video on what equipment you use such as lighting, camera etc.
Hey so do you think you could do a video on back to school for people with school uniforms?

My arm hair is not noticeable at all, and neither is the peach fuzz around/above my upper lip. 
But, my pubic, leg and underarm hair is ridiculously dark, and grows back ridiculously fast. I have no heritage that would make me especially hairy. That's just how my genetics happened I guess. But I still love myself!
I miss the makeup videos 😕
3:54  Damn, that woman on the left smilin' so long , I feel like she murder the whole facility after this video
Don't worry Mish... Your the one who taught me not to steer away from what I love and makes me happy... you always said life is like a blank canvas what we decide to to put on the canvas is up to us... and I know that this may be a difficult time in your life... but always remember you have the support of us fans who have been with you from the beginning. I love you Mish! ❤️❤️
how come Michelle or promise don't do guys make up (feminine make up) more? :( I wanna see them make a guy look like a great girl or I can be that guy :) I'd pay like 100 dollars :D
If there's anyone reading this, I'm going homeless in 14 days unless I get help. 25 min video on my channel for anyone who wants to hear my story. Hope someone reads this.

Electrolysis hurts soooo bad!!
hi I love you when are you going to go live on YouTube😃
I wish you mentioned that electrolysis is only for SMALL AREA PERMANENT removal. As someone who got laser on legs and arms, I am so happy that you mentioned 80% reduction. Lots of people expect to never have to shave with laser & that is not true at all. Hormonal issues can also cause hair regrowth despite laser. Also if you get too much laser done or it is 2 strong it can stimulate hair regrowth so for anyone interested please do not cut corners and go to a reputable place. Thank you for that wax recipe!! It is so gentle! I just wanted to share my experience. :)
cool michelle low you

Hi Michelle. I love learning something new from watching your videos. I'm a late viewer, been busy with school and I was wondering if you can do a video on how to clear insect bite scars on your skin. I been getting bite everyday by summer bugs and I have dark spots on my calfs and arms.
Epilators never pluck any of my hairs😒 dunno why

Hello from Vietnam.
Xin chao Michelle
Can you please do a Harley Quinn inspired makeup tutorial
I sometimes prefer to use guy razors but never thought about these things in my shaving routine. Thank you mich. xoxo❤️❤️❤️😋😋
Intense pulse lighting can be another alternative. I just began a home treatment.
When I saw the title and intro i was like wtf, i thought it's head hair removal. Then I quickly realized body hair and stuff. Sorry I was born with thin hair, so I'm literally hairless on my body
Can you do a back to school tips for girls
we have the same hair color @michellephan
I didn't know removing hair was artistic
just silly info waste
Michelle has changed from how she used to be...miss the old her
Michelle please do back to school videos some of us are going back to school
Does anyone remember her Barbie zombie video?
Can anyone that actually tried hair bleaching tell me more about their experience? like is it a good thing to do, is it effective.....I'm so sick of shaving my arms, but i have a light skin colour and dark hair, so the moment it grows you can see it all
DID she really just do a commercial. Pure advertisement, pointless video.
 What happened? 
Could you do a video on different brushes and what to use them for? I would find that really helpful 💕
Loved this video awesome job Michelle :-)
Plz do Harley Quinn makeup tutorial!
Your hair! ♥ It's like Rhea from your Helios: Femina ☺ Love you Mish!
Wow. This video is so amazing. I just know it's gonna be just as good when I see it the second time around on Buzzfeed 🐸☕️
I thought it was about hair dye removal lol
Honestly, laser hair removal in the USA is different from in Vietnam. Anw, I'm so happy I'm the first one to liked!!!!
Are you going to do makeup tutorials again
your my idol
who else misses her old makeup videos also the ones with her boyfriend :')
NAIR.... I barely had time to wipe the foam off when it burned me so bad. Or maybe I had a severe allergic reaction, I'm not sure what it was but NOPE!!!
how tall are you
I'm blonde everywhere but in the bikini and underarm area, and I don't shave (feminist and laziness reasons) but I love Michelle's new series so I watch it anyway.
Could you do another draw my life plz 😬😀😀😀😀😘😜😛😛😛😛😛
W the hell i just realised that her last name is dan and phils ship name i have a feeling that im one of the last people to realise this
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO A HARLEY QUINN TUTORIAL that would be really cool as it is very current right now
I was watching old Michelle videos and I realized that Michelle is like the ultimate future teller. She used cushion compacts before they were cool, color correctors, contouring... Even in her Trend Reports she called out trends and then BAM, they were big on Instagram the next week. It's so creepy yet cool..
Ugh threading hurts SO BAD! Maybe I'm just sensitive but I got threading and it hurt so bad, I almost started crying, and then it was tender. I didn't get an allergic reaction or anything, but the whole ripping hair follicles out from your eyebrow is not for me.  At least until I stop being a bit of a baby.
Pls do the kids makeup challenge! 👧🏼💄
Su voz me da sueño
waxing and threading or any kind of hair removal is prohibited threading is used for moustaches in the middle east 😂

She's so cute
mình là người viêt nam nhưng,nhưng tiếng anh rấy hạn chế vì mình miứi có 10 mấy tuổi,mình xem rất nhiều video làm đẹp của bạn và nhận thấy không có phụ đề tiếng việt(hơi thất vọng vì có nhiều video của chị mà em rất thích),nên em góp ý cho chị là hãy làm thêm nhiều video có phụ đề tiếng việt vì như vậy sẽ tiếp cận được nhiều ban trẻ việt nam hơn,mong chị sẽ để lại phản hồi,yêu chị :-) :-) :-)
my hair is getting darker in summer and it's growing wildly, it is too much especially after I came to Japan girls' skin here are just perfect:((( have anyone tried the laser hair removal device that you can do it home?
Am i the only one who is so bored of these videos u don't even see her in them I miss her old chatty videos still love her tho
Why should we remove our hair in the first place with all these procedures, isn't time for woman to accept their body and have the choice instead of following some nonsense beauty diktats?
where is she from?
I miss you michelle phan 😢 i love you so much ❤️
I wanna see a video with Dominique💔😭
Who else wold love tha Michelle got a vlog channel😍😍
i just couldn't fully focus on what she said at last part, i got too carried away because of her beauty like how she was laughing got me😍😍
I use Nair, wax strips and razor (not at same time though haha)
Can we get a Harley Quinn makeup tutorial? I miss those types of videos
when r u gonna post another makeup tutorial
Michelle Phan!!!! DavidSoComedy LOVED YOU❤️❤️❤️❤️
I miss you teaching us diferent makeup looks
¿Quien viene de Cuanta Razon?
I'm reading Helios Femina and it's amazing! Xx
Hi Michelle! Please make some video with your boyfriend? You Guy is goals!
Too bad you make not much more diys and small movies. Or confidently videos, so i got more confidence. Im really shy.. 😕 I hope you make movies again as before. But i love you're video "Mastering The Art Of Beauty Oils" super fun!! 💛

PS. Sorry if i say something wrong, im using google translate 😄
I kinda miss her old make-up videos
I have bad experience with Nair hair cream removal it left my arm decolourised even th I followed all the instructions given don't not use chemicals !!! to remove your arm hair
I miss your old videos
How does the skin stay smooth for 6 weeks after using an epilator? My legs get hairy after barely 3 weeks.
Threading hurts !
It's so funny, just now I were sitting in a Pho place called Phoreal in Shanghai, three guys on next table were talking about you! They were surprised about your height, no offense, but that proofs how famous you are, even in China!😘
Any one else miss the old Michelle who used to ACTUALLY do makeup tutorials???
I love your videos keep doing them 💜❤️
michelle could you make a hair tutorial? with all benifits health, split ends , styling products what not to do , good tips for different hair types and picking the best hair colors
please do a back to school I'm moving to a new school and your advice would really help - Luv ya Mish 😘
My favorite old videos were clubbing makeup and her holiday makeup tutorials with the shell wallpaper
Hey Michelle I was just wondering if you could give us a full BEAT face tutorial. Cake it on girl I'd love to see :)
MAPORRCCCODDDIIIIOOOOO
THANK YOUU
Sugaring is also a Middle-Eastern technique.
Aww Michelle i loved this video. You are the first beauty guru i ever watched over 7 yrs ago when you used to have your ricebunny account, much love xoxo
Where did you buy your sailor moon compact

I miss your old videos... They aren't the same :(
Hope you make makeup tutorial
I miss her old make up tutorial video ☹️
Is she still with Dom?
why can't everybody just be hairy and happy... i'm saving a lot of money and time by just not caring.
Hello from Morocco
Please do full face using only kids makeup
To Michelle:The 1st emperor of China would trade his fortune for it<<You Qi Code>> at Amazon.com

Deserved of your attention

Love that you use women with different skin tones!!
I wish michelle was in the video instead of the models. nothing against them and the video was great i just miss watching the old ones
Nice video and great editing but... we want YOU and your TUTORIALSSSSSS
that medium skin toned girl is gorgeous😍
Kinda sad that you rarely show yourself on your own videos....
Omg the darker model has the same birth mark like me in the same exact place 😲
I think I'm the only person who doesn't really wanna tan lol
the short blue haired girl looks totally like Jenna Marbles:P
PLEASE DO A MAKEUP TUTORIAL! YOU'VE ONLY DONE ONE THIS YEAR!
What channel is this?? None of her videos barely have michelle..
here I am working so hard to get rid of tan -_-
this look like buzzfeedvideos
Loving this series , Mish! But can you please make more videos with you ? We miss you ! x {^•^}
Who else missed her videos? 😍💕
Will you do a "master the art of shaving/wax/sugaring?" I'm suffering from strawberry legs T.T
Where do you find these amazing people to be in your videos? They seem so sweet! 💕
If you're reading this never forget that you're beautiful inside & out, don't stress too much and hope you have a wonderful week!! 💓
Girl you're not even in your own video
Editing goalsssss
All of the models were gorgeous!! And the black girl's hair!!! Lovely video
That (I'm assuming)Indian girl is so beautiful😍❤️
I actually need a video on how to get fair skin #asianproblems 😂😂
Yay! Tanning for dark skin! I love knowing that I'm being represented :
I feel like all the Asians on YouTube are amazing at editing: Michelle, Ryan (nigahiga), wengie, Iamkareno, etc.
Hey thanks for including dark skin too!
I miss when she did makeup tutorials and uploaded them often...
Nice video! Editing goalss!! ILYSM
please do the art of sunscreen 😢
I absolutely love your webtoon!! Everything is drawn so beautifully and I love how BeBo is a total badass yet so freakin adorable. I can't wait for more chapters :)
"Repeat after me, exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate"  Me: EXTERMINATE REGENERATE
Michelle, you choose the prettiest and most gorgeous girls for your videos! Love ya ❤️✨
Also don't for get to apply a light barrier cream to your elbows and knees too, where the tan may cling and come out noticeably darker 😊
or I could step outside for 2 minutes.. I'll get 5 darker
How do you edit your videos?!.. Gosh they're amazing! Love you beautiful ❤️😘
she didn't say good luck :(
Can you make a video on how to lighten the skin ? I want to be paler c:
that one dislike is bugging me already

The dark model in the coral top is so beautiful

The comic is REALLY good I'm always excited for the next chapter 😊
Um the medium skin tone model is gorgeous! 😍
Highkey miss her make up tutorials. 😟

The dark skin toned girl is stunning
If you miss Michelle's Makeup tutorials, Great. go watch them then because she has over 200 of them. she's done just about everything so she can do whatever she wants now.
That Indian chic though! Love that bunny❤️
YASSSS GURL!!! WERK IT!!
missing mish' face
Dear Michelle, I love the artwork and story line so far for your webtoon! However, the story can be a bit hard to follow and some things can be vague. The name and concept is also amazing. 💕
I love you Michelle! There is define try nothing negative about what I'm going to say. However, I am simply wondering if you are done with makeup tutorials.  I'm nit trying to be rude, but I have asked in the last couple videos and you haven't responded 🙁. If you'd prefer to keep that private, I'm not trying to prod or anything! Just curious to see if you're still going to do makeup tutorials. Love you ❤️
Where are the makeup tutorials? I want some😂😂😂
Editing Queen ❤️
Michelle!Can you please do the mastering the art of Brows next time?
How do you put self tanners on your back if you live alone?
She never mentions all the chemicals in those products that you are inhaling and absorbing through your skin. Love the skin your in.
Hi Michelle, remember me? I'm the girl that said I saw a lot of myself in you and you enjoyed my videos. After two years of film making I have created some creations that I am positive you will love. I will not let you down again, take a peak. Sincerely with best wishes, Belle.
You realy are an Inspiration to me 👌 😘
I'm just going to embrace being as pale as a porcelain doll bc this is too much work
I'm way to lazy to tan lol
only watching this because I love her video aesthetic
well that's bs. Your body needs the sunlight. sunlight= Vitamin D=very important for your muscles and bones.
Also just use SPF50
As much as I love you, I miss the old you. Your different. I miss all of the makeup tutorials. Now you just have weird stuff
Please please please do some makeup tutorials that has you in it
If you do I might cry😂
5 months since a makeup tutorial

THANK YOU Michelle for the tutorial :))) love from your Indonesian subscriber

Omg you draw so Beautyful 😍😍😍
Michelle keep on working on your videos to get the diamond play button!!!!!!!! Good Luck!  :)
The black girl's hair is my goals. 😍✨ Also thanks for the tip on using tanning products to contour my body. Definitely going to try!
This is probably just me but Nisha (Medium Tone model) reminds me of Kareena Kapoor
That spray tan reminded me of scream queens 😬
Also don't forget to wear sunscreen everyone
lmao there's a video on how to prevent and repair sun damages (including tan) in my subscription box right after  : ')
Can you please upload a makeup tutorial 😭
I love you so much, so proud of you <3
OMG these models are gorgeous 😍😍💯💕🔥
Loved this💜 all the ladies were so pretty too!
your style has changed quite a bit but in a good way.  love you
Mastering the art of concealer next please! <3

MICHHHYYYYY I love your comic SOOO MUCH!!!!!! The colours are beautiful and make me inspired and happy and I just want to live in their world. Keep up the amazing work!!!!!!!
Thank you for having tanning for different skin tones!
Whatever happened to her doing makeup tutorials? I'm not hating on her recent videos but I miss her makeup tutorials.
Missed your face Mish.😭✨💖
thank you for posting this bc I have skin that looks like paper
IS MICHELLE AND DOM STILL TOGETHER? I NEED TO KNOOOOOW
The editing ❤️❤️❤️
I miss the makeup tutorials... I'm sure most of your fan base would want to see you doing what you did in the first place. Makeup tutorials.
You are my inpiration!🌞😍 i live in norway please visst us
I miss you Michelle!! please do a make up tutorial!  i miss your old video's 😭❤💕
you voice is literally the most calming thing ever
Michelle can you PLEASE make a video on how to get clear skin? I have weird dark patches/spots on my skin and I feel like I can never find products that fit my face type (dry, and somewhat sensitive) but I don't want to buy all these products that don't work or, most importantly, EXPENSIVE. If you make a video for people that have similar problems I will be VERY grateful!
I miss your makeup tutorials😢😢
MICHELLE I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS. YOU ARE MY ROLE MODEL!!  I LOVE YOU
I love the mastering art videos!Seriously they help us alot!Thank you❤
Earlies I've been!!!! <3 ❤️❤️💜 love you
i reeeally like helios femina, one of my fav webtoon :D
Your the best be blessed!!!
Yaaas for using different women!
I love this Michelle, you've really come such a long way ❤️
I like that you use different races in your videos. These people aren't too perfect but still so very beautiful! Like it should be. 

Aaaand I've read your comic and it seems really well done! Beautiful style, interesting and entertaining story and the background music is a cherry on a top. I have been a follower for the whole time you've been on youtube and I totally saw this coming from you. I'm glad that you made it. :) Wish you all the best.
I really like the drawing style from this video ^^
Michelle can you do a video about different lip products. ie. lipstick, lip stains, liquid lips and also how colours look on different coloured skins. And which colours are best suited to certain skin colours. 

I've looked but I some how, even if its bizarre geneuinly trust you. All your videos are something I learn from and keep on board. I could look at other YouTube videos buy i wouldn't have 100% faith in them as much as you. For these types of things. Also you've kinda been slaying with the different-makeup- type videos 😊💞🎉
HELP IDK IF MY SKIN IS MEDIUM OR DARK MEDIUM MY LIFE IS SAD
THE ONE LOOKED LIKE JENNA JOSEPH |-/
I EXFOLIATE for THIS?
Thank you so much Mishelle I am your biggest fan ever💓💓  I really REALLY  hope you'll see this
I see the baked potato trend is catching on, people want to be browner on the outside.

Personally I prefer cream to be inside the potato instead on the skin. iykwim
Great! Can you do a video on exercising?☆
THE GIRLS ARE SO PRETTY IM SCREAMIGN
I LOVEEE HELIOS FEMINA!! great vid, will definitely try these tips!
This is such a helpful video !!
I needed this video. 💙😍🔥
I missed your old videos Michelle
My favorite thing about you... 



Your last name. ;)
I felt kinda weird watching this video because I'm suuuuuper pale and all of these models were no doubt gorgeous, but much tanner than me already. I simply feel it would have been best to get actually pale people so I could see the changes and maybe try out these methods.
love you mish!!!
The edit is so amazing omg😍
in 10 minut over 1,000 views
i do love your vid but just feelin a lil dissappointed cause it feels not tht friendly like before :( but as long as ur happy :)
I'm in love with Helios femina!!! Michelle you have such great talent. everyday watching your videos I feel I wish was something even closer to what you are 😘 loveyou for you and for your hardwork.
When she talked about spray tanning by professionals, am I the only one who thought of scream queens ? 😂
I screamed when I got the notification 😂
She is amazing!!
Does this mean even going to the beach increases cancer risks?? 😧
I love these types of videos but I miss seeing u in the videos ❤️❤️❤️
I love your voice Michelle Phan :)
Love you mish! Please do a make up look!
her web cartoon is actual perfection omg 😭💕
I missed ur makeup tutorials!!
Yeeees needed this soo much!! :D
early bird!!
I liked this before watching it😆
bless ur soul michelle ♥♥
I miss her makeup tutorial vids 😭
HOW TF DO I REMOVE MY TAN
I'm so early :")))
I'm really enjoying your comic:)
Can you please do a video about Arabic makeup or Arabic eyeliner ☺️😊
tbh your my favorite youtuber and you were the first youtuber i watched it was that barbie transformation from like 2009 or something it was fun watching you evolve into the beautiful swan that you are xoxo❤❤❤
...or u could just accept your natural skin tone?
Hi Michelle can you do a webtoon tutorial of how you do your comic strips? I'm new to it and its an awesome comic and story. I love bebo character lol
i love your comic book
what is your job?!
isn't It makeup artiste?
Please do a video about primers pls :')
Proud to be pale 😁 who else??
Omggg I love Helios Femina pls make more web comics!!!
i just red your manga. The drawings are amazing and i am in the chapter 5 . Love it already
helios femina: so AMAAAAAAZIIINGGG!!!!!!!!!
but where is michelle :(
I got sunburnt  because i forgot to put sun screen on my face and I have an awful farmer tan on my arms :(
I WANT MAKE UP TUTORIALS😭😭😭❤❤❤
Hey Michelle Can Do A Story Video Kinda Like Your Older One You Did, Love You!
Remember when you did makeup tutorials lol
Don't get me wrong, I love this kind of videos: great quality, amazing drawings, but I'll have to admit I'm kind of missing your makeup tutorials. 5 months since a tutorial!
But...pores don't open or close..?
This is so helpful omg ily
There all so beautiful I wish I was as tan and as thin and fit I love you Michel
comment before the actual video play :')
are spray tans and tanning lotions damaging for your skin also?
can everyone stop begging for makeup tutorials? We know you subscribed for tutorials originally but a person has to develop. This is still beauty. Michelle doesn't have to do only ONE type of video her whole career. There are a a billion other beauty gurus you can harass. Jeeeeeez
The fact that the girls in your videos are always so different is awesome !!!
Your voice is sooo relaxing!!
thanks for the tips
can you please do a greek goddess look? i need it for a costume party. thank you ♡
Helios femina is soooooo good I love it
I hope you do a tutorial video on how you edit ur videos/ behind the scenes/ how you're setting up this kind of video... its so beautiful!
I internally screamed from the intro caused I'm a lifeguard and I'm in the sun all the time
(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
bianca is so gorgeous !!!
Ahh. I'm actually obsessed with Helios Femina✨✨😍😂
Michelle's avid includement of Women of Color makes me cry with happiness!
Can you do a video about shaving?!
I love this!! Looking forward to picking up some cushion compact foundations and tanning products at the store soon :) your videos are so on point <3
I love you Michelle❤️
thank you for including a black girl, people dont realize that we can tan too!
ولامام علي مافهمت شيء
Once again, your "models" (contributors? I am not sure what to call them) are gorgeous.
The Indian girl is gorgeous
Great video! I can tell you put a lot of effort and thought into creating it, and it really payed off! Looks amazing and is very professional but also down to earth :)
Tan girl wanting to be pale because of Kpop XD
We need You! Your smile, your voice, just you! Please stay with us in this year too, like you always did. LOVE YOU!
You are so talented! Cant wait for another awesome video!
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AGES I'M INTO SLIME NOW THAT'S WHY BUT BEFOR I WAS SO INTO MAKEUP
Mastering the art of sunless tanning: don't be white. :D
are her and Dom still together?
Pls do a Bella Cullen and Edward Cullen makeup look I'm dying to see one
WERK THE TANNNN!!
YOUR VOICE IS SOO RELAXING TO HEAR <3
Oh hell no....I'm waaaay to lazy for this. I mean I appreciate the editing and awesome video BUT I can barely be bothered to do my own makeup let alone put it all over my body....except during "sexy time" hehe #BowChikaWahWah ;)
Wow I'm pretty early!👍🏻
This is soooo important. And such a good tutorial. Michelle is such a role model!!!
I love helios femina 😍😍😍 but woow michelle you did an awsome job,like a boss😎😎😎
Love you so much  you are so inspirational
Why can't people just accept their skin tone as it already is? I'm so fair that the lightest shade of foundation is still too dark for me, but I'm not complaining. I love my fair complexion.
does she do beauty tutorials anymore? cos I only watched this cos imma fan
I love how diverse her videos are!!! Thank you, Michelle!!! <3
Like number 212
I appreciate the effort and consideration that you put into your videos so much Michelle!
the recent videos featuring people of all genders and races are on point!
your content is top notch quality, keep making videos like this please! xD
Gorgeous girls! And great tips, I'm very pale and never get tan anyway. Plus I don't like sunning haha. The tips of shaving does really help, since I have a lot of little dots every time. Probably because of waxing?
Does anyone else miss her make-up tutorials?
I still love her videos but I miss them! 😢
Lmao the black girl is already dark😭 why she gotta tan??
I know it's sad that Michelle hasn't been doing makeup tutorials and just showing herself, but these videos are amazing! It shows different skin types unlike many other you tubers (no hate, a lot of them are really amazing). I love these type of videos, and just enjoy for now on how hard Michelle works for her channel. I'm sure she'll do a makeup tutorial sometime later, but I think she's just exploring other topics to do. They're extremely helpful for me!
were supposed to see more of you RiceBunny!!! We miss you and your videos!
I THOUGHT IT WAS MARZIA IN THE THUMBNAIL
how about a video with Dom..?
wut animes u like
can  u do a room tour
The beauty community is lost without you Michelle. Please come back and upload :(
Michelle, when do you intent to sell your Glam bag in Europe, espacially in Belgium?
Can u do a House tour
they looks sexy 😉 by the way I miss pillow talk so much
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE SCHOOL VIDEOS AGAIN???? I LOVE THEM!😍 ANYONE ELESE WITH ME???😘✋
soooo early!!!!😂
Helios femina is the best...love this so much... thank u mish..😭😘😍
Hi Michelle i really love your channel since 2009 when i was 10 years old xD i noticed that you lost weight , can you do a video about it? I mean not basic things like 'drink lots of water ,workout and eat clean'. XO
Or maybe try going outside
HHIIIIII MICHELLE!!!
That Asian lady is beautiful
plz do a makeup tutorial
model's of different skin tone, good job Michelle ;)
omg they r beautiful!
I miss your old videos :/
Can you make a video about fixing uneven tan lines? And how to prevent accidental tanning in the sun even with sunscreen?
Such beautiful ladies! Love these type of videos. I'm always the 2nd shade from the lightest foundation, so this is helpful for when I want to be a bit more tan, and not a human reflector. Thanks, Mish!
Kasekathleen gives me a chloe price vibe
need more tutorial!!!
Lady beard looks better wearing those bras
Your videos are always amazing
and here I am, thanking God for my fair skin. I could never understand why tanning is a thing, especially when it's done wrong.
Bianca Alexa!
i think youve focus more on EM 😧
I love your voice so much
do foundation, concealer or powder
The Mayo clinic has seen a rise in younger clients with advanced cases of skin cancer because after applying a self tanner/spray tanner peiple stop using sunscreen.
Hey Mich,how are you?I want to figure out what I want to do in the future and I am LOST because I just think about high function and money and it is not a good thing.I also live somewhere where you do not earn a lot of money for my dream job which I would love to be a fashion designer and tennis athlete OR MAYBE A NURSE .I am not sure if I am going to be able to become that.
Can you please film a video on career advice which includes occupations,how you can  become it and what you can do to become it?I really need your help.
Truly loved how Michelle used girls of different races for this video! I found it really helpful:)
I have really orange, warm toned skin. Thanks for the tips Michelle!
great tips....and the models are beautiful
Good job  👍👍

Can you have a brief look on our video and also let me know what you would think as I think you could have an eye for the work
Master the art of eyeliner??? Please???❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your app isn't available in Canada 😭😭
don't use Vaseline, it has drying agents. believe it or not.
When will you do a makeup tutorial?
you know what thing i like yours  . Michelle Phan
+Jasmin96961said:
I subscribed to her in 2009 and I have been your loyal viewer. As much as I am happy that you have succeeded, I must admit that I don't feel the connection anymore. I loved your videos, I adored you. But now you have just disappeared, detached. I feel like you are breaking up with us Michelle. Maybe just a vlog, or quick get ready with me, or just your everyday makeup tutorial that your viewers so desparately await
+Denai Win replied:
SAID IT JUST HOW I WAS GONNA LOL
please do a makeup tutorial
I respect Michelle for having work, personal life, youtube, and then still have to time to continue her comic. I not yet to find a passion like hers. :')
hey Michelle I have been watching you for so long and this is my first comment so I just want to say you are  an amazing human being!
Or just be like me :D
I love your videos💗
but you need vitamen d on the natural way 😣 come on there is suncream ...
I really miss Michelle's old make up videos until i rewatch it over and over again 😞😕
yay i was planning on self tanning for the holiday weekend!
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
Such a good video! Love you Michelle!
ты сэкси девужка 
I suggest do more DIY videos Michelle! I really miss those

the short hair girl looks so emotionless lol
makeup collection
Im so white, like a ghost, I can't tan, no matter what I do 😔. Thats frustating
Dang I have median skin so I don't tan :p
miss ur tutorial ur vlog..
I appreciate that you are being inclusive but Asian and Black girls don't tan,Well not intentionally anyway.
Can you make another tutorial? I miss them !! Maybe a cut-crease?
You have the most helpful videos Michelle! And the art in Helios femina is so so pretty !!
where did your makeup videos go :(
When are you going to upload a new makeup tutorial?
When are you going to do makeup tutorials again? ❤️❤️❤️
How long do spray tans last if done by a professional?
But how to I put tanner on my back???
I REALLY LOVE HELIOS FEMINAA <3

Lovely, lovely video! Please do more like these! ❤️
Omg I loved this video

Please upload the next video about makeup using less than 5 makeup produce. Thank u
Selma Hayek, is that U??? LOL.
Seriously do a makeup tutorial that is what you are known for
I'm already a tan girl but I love any of Michelle's videos <3 you keep on doing what you like Michelle. I'm here to support you any way (: thank you!! Snapchatfam.
I've wondered what the point of tanning was if you already had a deep skin tone, now i understand thanks to this video :)
That moment when you watch this anyway but you are already tan because it's summer. I tan so easily. :O
Michelle love ya girl but it's been 3 weeks without a video and 15 vids without a tutorial!! I love these vids too but miss ur tutorials
I know I'm gonna get some heat for this, because I've seen other people in the comments have that happen to them, but I really miss her tutorials. Yes, I know she's changing, and that's truly amazing. But YouTube is where she got her start, and her subscribers are a big reason why she's so successful, and it's just disheartening to see her putting less effort into her biggest reason for success.
are you a fan of ze frank
I thought your channel was about being a beauty guru and doing makeup tutorials.😠
I'm so happy I'm naturally tan🙏🏽😊🇭🇳
Hey, could you please consider putting captions in your videos? :)
I hope you come back... You've fallen off. Regain your reign girl!
Michelle, I love your Web Comic!!! I've watched your videos since you started and always loved when you showed yourself painting!! It's so cool to get to more art you created and a story you wrote!!
I just love listening to Michelle!
I miss michelle
Am I the only one that wants more makeup videos🤔😂
So refreshing to see models of all colors, ethnicities, and hair textures. Next time we might even be lucky enough to see different body types. So glad you're switching it up, Michelle. You rock!
im not spray tanning thanks to scream queens 😂
I love that you have different women with different body, hair & skin types!
meh i like my pale skin~
Please do a pillow talk Mish we miss you
It's really helpful and I can tell you put a lot of work into these videos but your channel is special because of YOU! These tutorials of random girls and professional editing, I can find on other company channels :( miss just you on this channel Michelle!
Are there any Cruelty free Products?  I don't mean to be "that guy" I'm not vegan but I'm slowly transitioning as best i can and will only use cruelty-free/vegan beauty products. I'll do some research in case anyone is wondering :)))
Lol i literally JUST put on my fake tan XD
Can you do a video on highlighting and contouring and how to get different looks with it? Thanks ❤️
are spray tans and tanning lotions damaging for your skin?
this reminds me so much of buzzfeed😂
Please upload the next video about makeup using less than 5 makeup produce. Thank u
yasss early
lovely video and great tips:)) thank you<3
who else thought of Josh Ramsay in the bts for one love. when he says " they tell you to go get a spray tan, what they don't tell you is that the bottoms of your feet  go WHAT!" lol
Great and beutifully edited video michelle! :))) and beautiful girls! <3
i love the hair
i feel like sunless tanner is not any safer than tanning....they are loaded with chemicals.   :-/
I know this is a random question but were u ever a summer camp councillor in Toronto ?
I've never been so early 😘
I don't mind self-tanner, adding a healthy sun-kissed glow is nice, until you look like an orange oopa-loompa.
Maybe because I'm Filipino, natural brightening exfoliants, toner, and rich serums for dewy, luminous skin is ideal, but to each their own.
Anyone else think she's busy with the re-vamp of EM? Maybe the next tutorial will feature her new products
Can you pls make more makeup tutorials? Can you make a natural makeup look pls? Thanks Mish!!
I went to school under the sun 30° once for 10 minutes and got tanned!! 🙁 I don't want to get tan i want to give my skin 😂
WOW MICH U ARE QUEEN AND YOU ARE AMAZING LOVE U  :*greetins from bosnia and herzegovina
Helios:Femina is goals i love it so so so much. I love how the characters are very original and unique and they are different from the typical comics. Absolutely amazing
The light skin girl looks so angry and bored
We miss you and your tutorials!
Omg those girls are so cute!! I love the direction Michelle has taken this channel. So original and more creative than all the other gurus
Helios Femina has beautiful art!
Michelle, can you do more makeup tutorials, like an all drugstore makeup tutorial for those who are teenagers getting into makeup?
Hey Michelle , I have seen you animations and drawing and I love them but I really want to know what tools you use because I really interested in draw more
Can you do just a basic everyday makeup rhetorical that you do with products
Hey Michelle! Can you please do a tutorial of your webtoon "Helios: Femina" for one of the characters. I'm a huge fan of the story and the art! I thought maybe a makeup tutorial would be nice. 😊
I redeemed your makeup mood enhancer in dewy skin through Ipsy and absolutely LOVE it! I went to your site to buy another and can't find it! 😢 was this only available through ipsy?
THANK YOU! <3
your videos used to be nice and beautiful but now they are not that interesting to watch
I miss the one-on-one videos with Michelle and her casual tutorials instead of just voiceovers with perfect looking models. Sure the quality is better but it's too generic. I used to watch every video, and now I'm thinking about unsubbing.
Any kind of tanning is bad, Michelle
I LOVE U SM❤️❤️❤️
Michelle, you forgot about fair-as-a-ghost females!
.I appreciate what you do.you have so many subscribers for a reason.You are so nice xo
I've never understood why tanning is an OK thing but fairness cream and skin clearing is such a horrible thing .-.
And if you have eczema.....?
I miss you Mish!! ❤️️
I really miss old Michelle I miss her
It would have been so awesome to see you in bikini for fair tone ;) but it was just your soothing voice :/
Disbunnybites is a total babe.
Nopenopenope no spray tan for me (scream queens)😂😂
THANK YOU
Please make a what's on my iPhone video!😊 I have been waiting for you to make one ever since you filmed the "my favourite tech items" video.
u never r in ur videos and never upload often.. u might be a busy women but u have fans and YouTube is were u started cries 😭
I ❤️ your videos!! 😄 😄 😄
How do people put the tanner on their backs?
WHY DID MICHELLE CHANGE SO MUCH 😔 I miss here old videos
I miss her old videos, don't get me wrong her videos are great now and amazing quality! I just kinda miss her being in her videos and her old style, but I still love Michelle and Nice Job on this video c:
Hi I need a tutorial for people with freckles I can never find what eye shadows or facial things to do

why is everyone so beautiful in this video lol😁
That buffing brush is a good idea!
We miss you Michelle!
I just kinda miss those makeup tutorials.
Michelle can u do a morning routine please..
Imissyou michelle! your old videos style please
We want your tutorials and u, tbh
Such a great video, amazing editing, and so great that you include a variety of different people of different races and different skin tones...but I think a lot of your subscribers would like to see more make up tutorials, we miss them :(

love you michelle <3
3:44 OMG she looks like SHANE! Lmao

When is the next video? I can't wait
Did she do a video on exfoliating cause sadly I don't know what that is 😓
Lol, I'm tan 24/7 365 days of the year. What's the reason why people tan?
thanks😉
I am a big fan of you
One hundredth comment! Love the video! Anyone else here look like a ghost? I NEED a tan!🤓
The music at the very end always gets me
I love your book!!
Do you have siblings
lmao i want to lighten my face tbh because it doesn't match my body at all xd so no more tanning for me
please make trend repport video! i'm waiting to it :D
As a girl with cancer i just want to clear up some misconspections.1 while skin cancer can be a result of no sunscreen, skin cancer rates go down when we dont rely on sunscreen 2 no one is probobly still reading this 3 i am also fay
i don't get tan. i am as white as casper.. but i'm ok with it :))
mitchelle we want to see you in videos we love you
Am I the only one who like these new type of videos? I am learning a lot from Michelle and I trust her sources of information
what if I wax
michelle, what happened to beauty tutorials? Now all u do is pillow talks, master the art, and trend reports!
Michelle Phan is real
Michelle can you make more makeup tutorials if you are too busy I totally understand
Michelle could you do a video on how to get clear skin this summer? I would really like to get clear skin because I'm starting high school in september
I don't tan, just burn. So I just put sunscreen everytime I'm out and it's boiling outside.
All of these women are so beautiful 😄
Thank you for including the brown girl- I've never seen someone a girl like me with a similar skin colour to me. Thank you!
michelle i am missing ur makeup videos
i have officially watched all of her vids 50 times and i literally only watch because i love the sound of her voice :/
thkssss! needed this videooooo!
Cigarettes are better than sun yay
I wish you would have showed tricks on how to apply it to your back. It's so hard to reach that area and get it even!
Hey 💜 you
Can you do another makeup video? I kinda miss them, and I know your busy with work
im in love
This video is sooooooooo helpful :)
Maybe I'll get a spray tan, idunno how much its gonna cost here in norway tho xD
I hope we meet sometime!
not useful and not interresting
I miss Michelle's old videos :(
I love your video's
Sao chị k lm video nói tiếng việt nhỉ?!
We miss seeing YOUR tutorials Mish.
Loved this!
Beautiful diversity :)
Where are the makeup tutorials??!?😑😫😫
The music is sooooo Buzzfeed😂
And here I am avoiding the sun and the beach because I hate tanning, I am pretty pale too...(The sun in Greece is WILD)
I think I need to just spray tan my legs... o_o
Bianca!
What can I do if I can't avoid deodorant? can I use one of those spray on dry deodorants after I use the tan? Because... trust me on this one I can't NOT use deodorant...
How do you get RID of tan?
I love how you used different types of women with different skin types but ur going away from ur fans, pls we all miss ur old videos where u star it I gave  this video a thumbs up but yeh hope u read this and take a moment to think about it thankss mish love yaa <3
love you
we want makeup tutorials Michelle!  
were are youuu 
why you left us 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
I miss you!!! 😭😭
what michelle use to edit her videos?
I live in Massachusetts
as I watch this with a sunburn...
Tan tips for skin with asian touch would be good too
plz show art for color improvement 
in india v are tanning like hell due to harsh sun 
and all are already brow shaded plz show colour improvement method
I love Helios Femina!!!!!!!! It's so good!!! 😊😊
Michelle Phan is just trying to add some diversity in her videos, I don't understand why people are tripping. Also, this video is very helpful because of the different skin tones. And maybe she doesn't want to be in her videos sometimes and prefers to direct them. There's nothing wrong with that.
mish i lovet...
Я одна русская?
I'm probably gonna get skin cancer XD
your makeup tutorialss???what hapenns?
I've been at tennis practice, and now I have a terrible tan on my shoulders and back smh.
i'm here already tan and i'm scared to go outside because i don't wanna get darker
Omg cringing so hard at the part where she is shaving her leg when its completely DRY
I like my pale skin and I don't get why orangey skin is so popular. In a way it's kinda racist preferring a certain skin tone
am i the only person who prefers to be pale? im naturally very tan, but i try my hardest to avoid the sun so that i don't tan. (i tan incredibly easily :/ )
Who miss old Michelle
Is the girl with curly hair a hand model? Idk lol she looks familiar
I got webtoons just for Helios and I love it so much! The art is so captivating and so is the story
It's summer🏝!
The dark skin girl is freaking gorgeous!!!! 😍😍😍😍. Her Afro is stunning on her. I think I'm in love lol.
If you hadn't have made Helios Femina I would have never found webtoon and the amazing comics on the app including Helios Femina, Nightmare Factory and others
if korean see this, they think like you guys are damaging your beauty
Omg the girls are georgeous  uwu
I a little love tanning and i not wearing deodront
am i the only one who freaked out at the spray tanning bc of scream queens lol
i dont understand why would they want to tan if theyre naturally tanned?
when did this channel become a tips and tricks channel? I thought it was a makeup channel
Is there going to be a video on staying fair during the summer? 😅 I don't like having tan lines...
Hi Michelle! Can you please make a 'lip kit by kylie swatches' video? I'm considering to buy a lip kit, but I don't know in which colour, because the colours definitely look different on every skintone and I think I may have the same as yours, since we're both from Vietnam.
- If I sounded kinda offensive, I didn't mean to sound offensive in any way..
I live in the Netherlands. What is the sun?
how long do these last?
I don't care how bad it is I tan in the sun at the beach all the time
i used to be faid but this summer im really tanned:(
PLEASE. DO. A. MAKEUP. TUTORIAL!!!!!!! 😫😫
Surely she's running out ideas on make up
I really love you
What's a good product for cool tones?
Please can you answer Michelle 😥
I love helios femina 💖💖
What's the deal with tanning?! I personally don't like the tan look. It looks so artificial. Why can't people just be happy with their natural skin color & their natural beauty without wasting a second of time or $0.01 of money on the way they look!?
when is her bday?
yay
I love that she use 3 girls with different skintone
Hey Michelle, could you at least upload an update video for 2018/2019?
What are some products do you suggest?i love you so much been around  when that lady gaga vid came out
what are the things they put on their hands to apply the mousse?
I have watched you for over 6 years now, and this is the first comment ever :) I love the vibes of your videos. so peaceful, accepting, releasing and beautiful. so alive and freeing! thank you for not forcing any beauty standards and make all of us feel loved and beautiful michelle. it means a lot. I recently recovering from my eating disorder after 9 years and realized you are almost the only guru who makes me feel like it's okay to be my natural self and feel beautiful. thank you so much. always love you  xx
I love u
updated 20 dollar makeup challenge
I am always pale as a ghost nothing works for me.....
First, I don't hate your video but this is just my personal opinion: I don't see why tanning is considered healthy in our society If nowadays you're just putting things on your body or staying directly exposed for hours in the sun. I mean anyone can do whatever they want with their body, I just don't like how everyone is obssessed about tanning.
 I just wish people could realize that not everyone thinks they want a tan or will look better with one. And I'm just saying this because I don't see anyone posting a video of "how to protect your natural skin from the sun" or stuff like that '-'
the light skin is as dark as I ever will be
i have extremely fair and have sun damaged skin. i don't want to have skin cancer when I'm older though.. any tips to help my skin
Thank you for the video michelle since im pregnant and i dont want to be exposed to the sun and im not trying to tan in the sun anymore especially because of skin cancer . Have a nice day michelle
I don't believe the "you get skin cancer from the sun" I basically live in the sun, especially here in the Caribbean. I think people tell you that just to psych you out..
I don't get the deodorant one ? Like why would you put self tanner in your armpits anyway ?
I wish I could self tan but I always look like an orange spotted cow because I have fair skin :ppp
The Indian girl is so pretty
SOMEONE REPLY TO MY COMMENT
😍😍
😍😍
I love how Michelle has the beautiful chocolate girl in the begening like "yas we are interracial girl"
Definitely smart for those who want to slow aging (real tanning does age the skin) and also for those that are high risk to skin cancer.  Many of my clients have aging and skin damage by the sun.  This is a good alternative and info!
for some reason I am in the mood for pr0n now.
'Or you could accept your natural skintone' comments are annoying! ... This would be my natural skintone if I went and tanned in the sun.. but I don't want the damage. Nothing unnatural about a tan 😪
Sunless tanning seems like a nice idea but i don't want to make myself darker than i already am. It makes no sense, since i already have colored skin, you know?
wait so i am not allowed to go out in the sun?
Trump needs to watch this
I would love to do self tanners but I am super scared! Knowing my luck I would be different shades everywhere. LOL I work with the public so I wouldn't want to scare any of my patients. Any opinions on which brand/formula is best for newbies?
you inspired me on filming videos  and I made one. Check it out, I will be so glad to hear your feedback! You are amazing!
tanning under sun can damage your skin ,  which can cause a variety of skin problems.  sunless tanning is better option
My name is Kaylie
omg! at 3:10 i have that weird mark next to my belly button too! what is it from???
Hi
Your Poop Guy
I can get all that by just swimming. I feel like I'm 2 dark because the tanning is unintentional
Lol I don't know why I watched this.I just really live Michelle. I'm pale as hell and i don't want to get tan.
This is literally the opposite of the situation in my country. Most women want fair and light skin , you can find whitening/ brightening cream pretty much everywhere . And u guys in america want some tan
People who spray tan other people are not trained. Spray tanning is an unregulated service.
For all my fellow pale skin gals- Tarte's Brazillinace Self Tanner is INCREDIBLE! perfect amount of color, plus you can build it up, and it's definitely not too orange. It comes with a bit of a price tag, but I promise it is worth it! Usually I'll do a base tan once a week with this and then use Jergen's gradual tan throughout the week when I feel I need it. I hope this helps those with fair skin! (Btw this is coming from a ginger- super pale!)
...or u could just accept your natural skin tone?
...or u could just accept your natural skin tone?

loving tan gives a nice color but makes me itchy 🙄
you know what! I think you are not so good person and you talk about great things and morals... I mean you've lived under poverty and you knoe what it feels like but yet you keep the price of your makeup so high
...I mean who the hell can afford a 75$  eyeshadow palette?? or is it just that your brand is just for high end people and not for us? 😢😢😢😢
#Editinggoals!
In muchhhh lighter than ANY of the girls in this video I am very pale!
I ❤️ u !!!!!!!!
am i the only one that miss her old video :(
Could u plz do a challenge where u have to do ur whole makeup using only kids makeup so the makeup u would Fina at Claire's and at the toy section at target... Plzzzz do this challenge
All the girls are so pretty!
in malaysia, atleast 30 minutes under the sun and i already tanned af. and burn.
Wow you have not been posting alot
fun fun fun!
i think the reason she used 3 different girls is to show variety. plus she has already done a full bronzed look, including makeup, on herself before already.
your videos are just so good but you should show yourself more in your videos! we wanna see your face more
i like that you're using different models to accomodate everyone, but i wish you'd show up in your vids a bit more, because in the end, i did subscribe to see Michelle :)
Ive been a subsriber since 2008/09. I am unsubscribing until michelle phan actually gets back in her own videos.
Lol they had a light toned girl, but she was still pretty dang tan...none of this stuff works for anyone lighter than that. Wish I woulda seen a pasty white girl like me in a video like this haha
are those permanent tanning or they wash away ?
THANK GOD IM AFRICAN
helloooo
I have the same swimsuit as the girl with blue hair
Michelle you should have been in the video :-(
Why is everyone angry that Michelle wasn't the only person in the video?? She's including different skin tones... She has to have multiple models
Why doesnt she do makeup vids
She didn't say "good luck" in this video. Just got used to her saying it.
Does anyone know why Michelle blocked all her videos on the Rice bunny channel recently?
i like this vid and all, but can it be just you?
I kinda want Michelle to feature women with different body types because the three girls in this video has the so-called, "perfect" body. It would really help us insecure girls out there more :D
oh wow, didn't know about the pores in your legs..?! i've noticed it every single time when i do my spraytan (at home), i always get those weird black dots on my legs. but now i understand why..;) thank you so much michelle, keep it up with the great vids and i hope we'll see more videos like these or makeup tutorials (just absolutely love them!), take care x
Interesting. Learned so much.
None of these people are even pale
I'm tanned and I'm dying to be fair. I don't get people wanting to be tanned,or I'm just the ungrateful bastard with a skin tone that is to die for
Could you do a video on makeup styles worn around the world? Like what kind of makeup is popular on different continents in different countries? It's a big project but maybe you could do it sometime in the future? P.S. Could you feature Mongolia if you do this? It's my home country <3
It so nice how diverse you are Michelle! All these girls were beautiful. It just shows that anyone can be beautiful not just light skin people! I use to be put down because of my dark skin tone, but you inspired me so much!
But Michelle, the active ingredient DHA in self tanners also cause cancer, especially in spray form where it can get into your lungs. At least the sun gives vitamin D and the darker your skin builds a resistance to cancer.
How is tanning bad for you? I thought only burning was? I always tan loads but never burn, is that still bad?:o
I watched this like a million times ...has anyone else?
Come watch my first video!!!💜
Come watch my first video!!!💜
Where makeup videos?
Makeup tutorial pleasee😭😭😥😥
Who knew... this would be her last video 😔
is she still dating her boyfriend?
I love the tanorganics tanning oil. I have super pale skin, so this works well on me for a buildable tan. You can apply it with your hands and get dressed almost right after. I even wore a white t shirt after tanning and I had to look really good on it to see if there was any transfer, it was only a hint of color at the collar.
Really love how inclusive you are!!!!
So happy I'm an olive skin tone. No skin cancer for me, thank you very much.
I love Michelle soooooo much ❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😗
Black girl doesn't need a tan..she's naturally perfect 👌🏾😍
I agree that the sun causes cancer but won't all the chemicals in the tanning lotions do the same??
You're too awesome!!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I'm Indian all I want to do is get fairer!
Makeup tutorial plsssssssss
or just be black
The 2nd girl with the short blue hair has the bikini just like Alisha Marie but in pink.......if you guys know what I'm talking about #macbabbies 😁😁
style
Why is the black and Asian girl there? They already have melanin.
Is there any self tanner that could help even out redness on the skin? I really only use them to even out my face and chest, but can't seen to find one that helps with redness.
Can someone tell me what happened to her makeup brand?? Ik I'm late but I just saw some old videos of her makeup line and it looks so good! Where has it gone??
How about accepting your skin tone and the way Mother Nature made you? Girls, excess use of this chemical products CAN CAUSE CANCER AS WELL. I'm a goth that has embraced my naturally pale skin, and I love the way nature made me. Changing the color of your skin will not make you a better person inside nor a prettier person outside. Stop living for the ideals of female beauty imposed by others. You are fine just the way you are.
I love sunless tanning! I've gotten pretty good at an even application now and I like not having tan lines on my back. However I swam for a few minutes the other day and got a tan line below my other tan line from last year and now I am actually a tiger
Why do you always have other people in your videos and not yourself..?
when americans do anything to be tanned but filipinos do anything to get whiter. 😂😂
Wow
Omg I literally just 5 minuets ago started reading her webcomic, it's AMAZING I have serious chills.. I really hope she doesn't end up cancelling it because shes busy with her youtube or other projects or anything because I already know that I'm gonna be a hugee fan ^_^
Way too much sun misinformation.
Anyone else miss the old Michel who just did makeup videos and didn't try to be her own brand of buzzfeed.
Can you do a 3 minuite makeup challenge?
Why does everyone want to be tan? I'm Viet and have a darkish tan and I want to be more pale. I don't get it.
unsubbed because you don't upload frequently and your videos aren't as personal and raw as they were when you went to university.
Why they got a black woman trying to tan though? Just use toner to even out your skin or eat better because you are what you eat
I love you Michelle but you need to post more. notice how your average views have gone down. just because you are some bigshot YouTuber now doesn't mean you can't post after all we are the reason you are so blessed rn.
I'm glad that she added a black girl!
Dear gods above, what a groundbreaking video. Suntanning's been out of fashion for five years AT LEAST. Everyone and their mother uses and knows how to use self-tanners. This content is at least four years too late to be relevant.
why did she put a black person in this lol we don't tan we are the tan
Sh*t, i have now 70% more chance of having cancer, i tanned once in my life for like 45 minutes (not in once but whatever) and i've forgot to put sunscreen
who is the blonde girl please tell me her social medias or youtube chanel
I never had a tan in my life :/ my skin is too pale ugh...
Early 💗💕💙💜💚❤️
PRESS THE VIDEO SOMETHING COOL HAPPENS IF U NOTICE IT
hi
the chance  of skin cancer may increase,  but what about all the chemicals in tanners? I don't  want the extra chemicals  on my body. I'm  out in the sun from 7 to 11/12 am, I  have a nice tan and healthy skin. Health also comes from the inside, eat healthy,  try not to be outside when the sun is strong and enjoy  life. x
😊😊
sun contains vitamin d , sun is good for you! overtanning may cause cancer not the sun
her voice is so soothing
am i the only one who likes pale skin? don't get me wrong, a lot of girls look gorgeous with a tan. but us pale-skinned girls don't seem to get a lot of love. pale is so regal, I love it :)
i have acne scars and acne can you do more videos and i have a sun tan from being to  machine the sun how can i make my skin even and to my original color but with out sunless tanning or any tanning play anyone
Can anyone recommend a self tanner for skin that is already tan? I'm a student and can't afford the expensive loving tan and st tropez ones
Can you PLEASE do a video of your updated every day make up?? I've watched your videos since you uploaded your very post video. As an older woman then majority of your subscribers,  it would be nice to see an make up tutorial.  :)
they all have amazing postures and faces, but this black girl is to die for
I hate the sun and tanning. Every year i cry when summer comes
Ok the petroleum jelly on your hands trick is GENIUS. When I use self-tanner, even after washing my hands afterwards, sometimes I'll notice later a little color develops in my knuckles or the webs(?) in between my fingers.
Why does she have to use super skinny models? Even though they have different colors, she always uses very skinny models. How can this match witch her preaching that everybody is beautyiful.
I miss the makeup tutorials. What happened? You haven't uploaded one in 5 months. I used to watch them when I was down. I miss the old Michelle phan. Don't get me wrong she's still good just wished she posted more makeup tutorials and hair treatment ( or whatever it's called)
Any smaller YouTubers want to support each other? 💕💛😊😍
i enjoy that there is a variety of skin tones in this video, however I would love having michelle in the actual video. these ones feel more manufactured and it feels like she only did the voiceover.
ermmmm when you use self tanner you get a wrong  idea of how long you can be in the sun. Your body produces Melanin when tanning which is what gives you a tan and will protect your skin from dangerous UV-rays. If you have self tanner on you don get the Melanin since self tanner links to aminoacids on the very first layer of your skin. Therefor the tan only makes you look pretty but you're technically in more dager when being outside in the sun because the first layer o your skin is tanned but there is next to no Melanin to actually protect your skin
♥♥♥ I have a recommendation for all pale ladies out there Try out the St Tropez Gradual Tan in Shower Lotion :) ♥ I usually don't like self tanners because they make me look orange and streaky (I am white as a ghost!!). This lotion is used like a shower gel and you won't get ANY streaks at all. It's super awesome, so I thought I'd share this since it wasn't mentioned in the video ♥ Much love!
Hahahahaha that girl with "fair to light skin" is not light skin. I'm a ghost compared to her!!!
Kasey looks like Fang from ff13-1
the black girl is so pretty
I'm the whitest person and I'm too lazy to use self-tanner
your voice didnt change at all
I want to see Michelle, and ONLY Michelle, not any other girls like in your last 10 videos. sigh
Eh, this looks way too complicated and messy. I naturally tan easy so I'll just go outside. a little bit of sun isn't going to kill me.
Putting chemicals on your skin is still not got good for you, just as the sun and tanning beds are bad
is it fine to tan even if someone doesn't shave at all? i have never shaved my arms nor legs.
deodorant acts as a barrier? dont think i really care about having tan underarms.. haha
Am I the only one who came hear because they saw phan
Great video!
Come back
Hi Michelle Phan how are you I hope that well, what typography they use in this video is very cool!
What channel is this?? None of her videos barely have michelle..
Plz visit Massachusetts
Ugh I went and got a spray tan last night and then had a shower this morning (had to wait 8 hours to wash it) & it came off most of my legs !! Luckily I have this Dove gradual tan stuff but c'mon suppose to be 'professional' 😕
Sunless tanning is SOOOOO annoying.. I feel like there's a dirty layer on top of my skin and most of the time is STINKS! Also it can turn out pretty orange. That's why I just tan naturally and it leaves it looking nice and natural. I know it's bad! And it's pretty embarrassing :(
The girl with the colorful bikini is beautiful!!
awesome
awesome
For how long do you have to be in the sun to increase the risk of getting any cancer by 70%?! Not enough information about that in the video. If you already give out numbers at least give more information on those (and also were you got them from).
miss you
What did you sign Michele! What did you sign? It's your channel, and it started you behind the camera! Do another channel for these types of bodies but cmnon I want to see the Michele I feel in love with
Unpopular opinion.. To me tanning is as worse as skin bleaching. Unless your treating spots I think everyone natural skin should be embraced. "Imma get dark in the sun😒" or "im so pale😩" comments like that are so odd to say! Like there is no perfect tone or "glow".... Why is this a thing. NO SHADE LOVE YOU MICHELLE
Can u please please please bring back the ROSACE EARRINGS????????????
GIVEAWAY! iPhone 6 s , Apple Magic Mouse & earphones. Anyone wants to join ?
Mish, do you self tan???
so.......this channel is now a corporate channel and doesn't even feature michelle anymore.........guess she's too busy for youtube now
Can I not shave my legs?
Welcome to my Channel guys <3
I don't even tan on purpose. I go to the swimming pool and swim the whole time, and I get a little bit tan.
We miss you, where are you? I hope you're doing great Michelle
I personally love all skin colours as they are and wouldn't encourage tanning, but I like that even already browner people, like Asians and African, are included for any reasons. It makes people more the same.
Where are the pink and neon bathing suits from?
TÜRKİYEDEN SELAMMM
What's the song at the very end of the video? Anyone? Lol
Can I get likes for no reason ?
my question is why is the black girl tanning
It has become much like an advertising channel with no michelle phan... so unsubscribed (:
My skin is medium and for my current age, I feel like a natural tan provided by the sun will look better, but I don't always tan evenly. However, at the age of 14, is it still okay to use tanning products on certain areas? I have some events coming up soon, and I do not have enough time to get an actual tan, but I am still a bit concerned about sunless tanning.
Hi, guys 😊 Mish is receiving a lot of hate lately. And I can barely see good comments on every type of video that she makes. Maybe, some of you know me already, 'cause I literally comment on most of Mish's videos! Just so you know, please don't fight with Mish's haters! Why? A true dreamer (meaning a fan of Mish) DOESN'T fight with others. If you see a hater, just talk to them in a nice way.Don't say any foul words or hurtful statements. I fought with Mish's haters before on Instagram. Mish said, "Don't let others who choose to misunderstood you upset you. People fear what they don't know. Sometimes, the road to truth is paved with mysteries. Everyone has their path". So, it's actually normal (in this generation) from someone to hate. I'm not agreeing to hate, but this is reality. People will always find and find a reason to hate someone. So, if you're a dreamer...don't feel bad for anyone who hates Mish. It's THEIR path. What Mish wants us to be is a  dreamer. 😊

Happy Summer
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I have trouble loving my dark (sort of tan) skin. I'm Asian and being lighter skinned is desired, I feel so ugly. 😢
مرحبا
for this video why she is featuring those girls who have already tan and brown skin(except that one white girl)!!! if you are doing TANNING video atleast you have to feature white girl or yourself ..where is MICH???
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT SONG SHE USES AT THE END OF HER VIDEO'S!?!?!?
Send this video to Donald Trump
I want to unsubscribe please I miss the old Michelle I want makeup looks come back
Hey Michelle
This feels like a commercial from Buzzfeed. HER VOICE seriously, she's so lucky!
Why people don't like her anymore ?
Want to be tan but don't want to tan,Be Asian
...70% higher risk of skin cancer just by tanning?..not even actually burning, just by tanning? how is that possible.
why isnt she doing a makeup tutorial this is just sad
Pause at 3:29 and start touching the screen of your phone! It's so weird, pls try it!
Loved the video, but the Loving Tan self tanners are horrible, such a waste of money!
I find Michelle Phan's videos boring since mid-2015... I still love her but myyyyy, there is nothing really interesting anymore. :( Go ahead and throw all your hate at me, but I just wanted to say something.
I thought this was a buzzfeed video
Why do you promote such bad things? Such as makeup that tests on animals, going into tanning beds, and eating animal products?
I don't see videos of her almost a year,  she doesn't makeup tutorials anymore 👎👎
or i can just go out and stop being a vampire. #asianproblems
Maybe Michelle broke up with her boyfriend this year and that could be why she is not showing up on videos because she's depressed
Visit Malden, Massachusetts to be exact plzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!
new video!
OI GENTE. VISITEM MEU CANAL. FICAREI MUITO FELIZ...
GIVE ME YOUR LAST NAME
i swear by those tanning wipes. they sell them at ulta in different sizes and shades and they never turn out orange, but more of a cool toned bronze, which looks really nice, and never leaves me looking streaky.... SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME AND JUST BUY THESE AND TAKE MY WORD !!!! :)))
What gradual tanner did the black girl use? x
i hate to break this to you, but sunless lotion yes is safe, but increase acene, 
why not take the barbie drug our suntan pills, Put hawaii lotion on your body face tan like 3h than you will have sungod skin.
goin onto a plane to vietnam today! Visiting my country that i havent been to since i was 4 :)
How much time does this tan last? And aren't those chemicals in the products dangerous..?
i dont get it? why do girls want to tan their body and have ugly tan lines....
Actually deodorant can cause skin cancer too. Just depends on what type of deodorant You use.
Happy July 4!
Why would I dislike my perfectly fine pale skin?
Why don’t you just stay white... it’s perfect
why do you want to be tan? like I want to be white!! WTF? ps: using dads acc
ok im not racist but black (African Americans) need sun im black and I don't kmow what i would do I the sun was not existent but saying all the do say I dont think black peoplw would get skin cancer from the sun unless you r skin is sensitive (correct me if I'm wrong).
Tanning in the sun isn't hazardous with the right Protection
I know Michelle states she does not have time to physically be in videos anymore, but honestly, I really don't like these newer videos. It would be nice for her to do a make tutorial, skin care routine, or even like a favorites haul again with her looking into the camera and smiling at us at least once in a while. It's been since November of 2015 since we have had a video that the fans truly love. I'm not saying she can't grow and try new things, but you shouldn't forget your roots. Maybe instead of feeling like they owe Michelle, fans should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content; that way she would actually want to preserve her YouTube channel because I'm sorry all I get from these new videos is "Hey I don't have time for YouTube, so let me get people to physically be in my videos and I'll just do voiceovers. You guys obviously don't like my newer content nearly as much but I can keep doing it anyway because you all feel like you need to stay subscribed to me"
How are people still subscribed to this channel? She has over eight million subscribers yet the last video that got a million views was a makeup tutorial done months ago. If people are unhappy with her content just unsubscribe and maybe if enough people unsubscribe she will start doing things her fans originally subscribed for

Michelle was the OG of makeup gurus but too many people came along and swept her away. RIP this channel.
I missed you all so much this year, but a lot happened. I'll be ready next year to share my growth and what I've learned :) Thank you for your love and support. Sending you all positive thoughts during these dark times.
In case y'all are wondering. Michelle is fine,  yes.  She keeps up to date on ig and goes on live streams and continues to post stories. She said in her live last night that she's 30 or almost 30 and she feels like she's going through a time in her life where she is letting go and realizing the more important things,  which in her case she's letting go from "makeup" and YouTube.  She said that all people want to see is her cosplaying or makeup videos,  even though sometimes she just wanted to talk on yt.  She said that for her,  right now in her life.. not everything is about makeup.  She is moving on from that stage in her life and you guys should support that decision.  She wants to continue her studies in science and discovery and make more of herself as a grown women. And yes she is still with Dom and recently she went to a bts concert.  Just updating y'all.  You're welcome.
I read an article today in Self Magazine. She was depressed after her L'Oreal line didn't take off, so she took a break. She said her fan base complained about the prices of the products. I always feel so bad for Youtubers trying to make a living outside of YouTube. Most people's viewers seem like a bunch of college kids who can't afford to pay for anything.
This is a long shot, but Michelle, I'm glad you're coming back. I unsubbed thinking that you had left YouTube for the algorithm drama that happened awhile back and figured you were trying to find a better platform. Seeing the interview and the video from JK news, I want to let you know that you are so very brave. I've struggled with depression for years, and it hit me hard just after high school ended and only got worse for the years after. I'm 24 for now, and feel like I've been in a slump for the past 5 years, but am making moves to try and better myself. I am glad you took time off to just relax, experience, and find yourself. I hope you've found a place where you are content with everything and can breathe easy. I also wanted to say thank you. Thank you for being someone for me to look up to during my teen years. I didn't have many friends, but your videos always made me feel less alone. Each and every video made me feel like I had someone to talk to, someone to hang out and share with. So, for all those years you were there for me, I am eternally here for you to support you in whatever it is you decide to do going forward; whether that be YouTube or anything else. Just always continue being the amazing person you are, however that may be.
You just randomly popped in my head and I realized I haven't watched any of your videos forever! I thought I got unsubscribed from here, but noticed you haven't posted in 6 months! :o
Hoping to see your videos again, you were one of the first beauty youtubers I watched which inspired me to make my channel.
I only just started and just hit 100 subs- so if any other small youtubers want to support me that would be awesome
She changed profile pic, and deleted literally all the trend report video, hasn't uploaded in a very long time and her last make up tutorial is almost an year old

MICHELLE WHERE YOU AT?
YouTube is not the same without Michelle Phan! :( I remeber when I watch her video in 2008. I grow up with her.
Just to update you guys on Michelle since you guys don't want to know more about her.

Michelle took a hiatus and went to go on a "spiritual journey" but that journey was to expand her cosmetic line. She is giving her cosmetic line a "rebirth" so she says. Expect a new video in the future about her talking about it.

This is the reason she has not been making videos. As you can see she changed her picture to a hexagon for whatever reason. 

Also, her new products are based off crystals and gems. They look highly pigmented and beautiful.
Michelle deleted so many videos! Ahh I'm so sad...
Why she doesn't make videos?
Duality ✨
Why are so many of Michelle's videos hidden or unlisted?
michelle come back
wait wtf happened to her channel and videos
Tbh I miss Michelle and her fresh style and the effort put in these looks. Now the beauty community is about drama and that's how they sell their makeup now. By feeding off each other.
missing michelle's old videos so much :(
Has anyone else noticed Michelle deleted half of her videos on her channel? what's up with that??
Where has Michelle gone she never posts videos anymore at all this was 6 months ago where is she ??!!!!
Whenever you come back I'll be very happy. I've been watching you for 4 years now and I love your vids. I hope your alright and happy holidays!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
She deleted a lot of her videos. I'm starting to get kind of worried
WHY ARE ALL HER VIDEOS GONE? :(
Where are you now that I need you Michelle?

Is she still with Dominic?
hey michelle, do you make new videos soon? :o

This is STUNNING
Anywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live.

Thank you
or
Farewell

?
Her removed videos are still in her playlists 😕
Wow what happened to all your recent videos?
i miss your amazing makeup vids... i've watched your videos for the longest times and i haven't seen a makeup video like the ones you used to make...
Why'd you delete so many of your videos? They're all so great.
Michelle is becoming kevjumba!!!!! - 2k17
maybe she made "final dynasty" as her final video....
There is only 57 videos before the "200th Video" - so many deleted! 😰
For a second I actually thought this was going to be a makeup tutorial.... nope

where is she..
What I love the most about Michelle is that she puts so much work and effort in her videos. And how she still uploads often even know she has so many projects. She is just so diffrent to other famous youtubers, cause she doesn't create the same content that everyone else does. The definetly deserves more attention.
You were the first Youtuber I ever watched almost 8 years ago......I miss you! Come back😭
I love her videos and I'm truly worried about her. I watch this almost every day and can't believe it's almost one year this was uploaded...I hope she's fine.

EDIT: SHE'S BACK BLESS GOD. 
I'm so sad, I loved all those videos you deleted!!!!!Noooooooo((
Just patiently waiting for your return. 🙃

MICHELLE?!?!?! EVEN IF U HAVE OTHER JOBS, YOU CANT JUST DITCH YOUTUBE. COS U HAVE MILLIONS OF FANs AND PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LOOK UP TO YOU. 😭😭😭
The beauty community is lost without you! Please come back and upload :( I MISS YOU
Michelle Phan said on Twitter that she is going to take a break (I'm not sure it's going to be a long break). Michelle also said that she needed inspiration.
Both two gorgeous girls 😍😍
Just because you're starting a new cosmetics line doesn't mean you can/should forget about the YouTube channel that launched your career and gives you your customers
~I LOVE YOUR MAKEUP AND SENSE OF STYLE~
I can't believe this video was like half a year ago. I always go back and watch it. Makes me so happy!
Michelle Phan we miss you 😩💔
what happened to Michelle? is she quiting youtube? she hasnt posted for like 5 months and now she changed her profile picture to black? somebody tell me something i miss her!
Michelle's Channel is dead now since if she came back, she wouldn't get tons of views..
Happy Birthday, Michelle. I really hope you're feeling good as of right now, and not just because we miss your videos. But because we learned to love you throughout your journey, and even if we're all strangers here, we care about you so much. What I wish for you, is for you to be happy, to heal your mind and soul, to feel connected again with yourself, to have that spark in your eyes shining even brighter than before. So take this day  for yourself... and yourself only. Again, happy birthday, and let the world pamper you as you deserve. Good Luck, Mish. Love ya.
Come back already michelle 😭❤

PS: Guys, I've started making YT videos, please suggest a good content or visit my channel and give a Like/Subscribe. I appreciate it. Have a great day! 😚💕
She's still dating with Dom?
WHERE ARE YOU MICHELLE? ITS BEEN NINE MONTHS
miss your videos sooooo much... <3
People who cannot invent and reinvent themselves must be content with borrowed postures, secondhand ideas, fitting in instead of standing out. - Warren Bennis

Perhaps this is why so many people don't understand Michelle. She is growing, changing and improving constantly.
Can you start making more videos
This was a really nice video that was really well edited, but I just wanted to see some more makeup tutorials
Watching you grow over these last few years  has been a huge inspiration! I still remember looking at it in awe of what you had accomplished. I know every one experiences negative comments every now and then, and I'd like to counter that by telling you that you have the sweetest most expressive way of doing your make-up art I have ever seen! I think your personality and emotions are poured into every single piece and that makes it wonderful! Everyone experiences hardships and your fans will always be here working as your support. We love you, and we thank you for all the beautiful lessons you have taught us.  Just be strong like you taught us to be, okay? C=
michelle... we miss you so bad. come back already! 😭😭😭
This is so amazing! I love your editing it slays.
SHE'S BEEN REBRANDING EMCOSMETICS FOR THE PAST YEAR EVERYONE! Shes being more active on instagram and apparently coming back this year!!!  Like yaaas ❤❤❤
I love michelles videos because she doesnt copy what other youtubers are doing, she uses her own style and owns it. She isnt busy worrying about what others think and I really admire that.
when is she back? it's been half a year 😢
So beautiful 💕💕
pls do more videos michelle..... I miss watching all your videos
Odesza makes the best songs. They are so calming, catchy and awesome I love their work!!

I love this video so much. especially the trampoline roofs lol
When are you coming back to YouTube
micheeeelleeeee where are you???

Remember when Michelle actually uploaded
Reminds me of jessica's fly mv
I got this feeling that Michelle is becoming more spiritual and is exposed to the beauty and secrets of this universe.
Can't wait to see her transformation.
SHES A BTS FAM OHMYGOD
Pourquoi ne fait-elle plus de vidéos ?

AYYYY! Back from the Instagram live stream! I miss u! Btw, how come u don't upload as much anymore?
MAMA IM SHOOK HOPE YOU ARE DOING OKAY
So everyone's noticed how MIA Michelle is on YouTube now😭She was one of the first youtubers I subscribed to! Her content is so unique and I love her relationship with her boyfriend (I don't know if they're still together) I hope she doesn't quit YouTube!❣️
"I care so much about my fans, they mean the world to me, without them I would have nothing, so as thanks I'll abandon them"
I really miss michalle
Michelle Where You at? 🤷🏼‍♀️🙌🏽
Amazing just amazing 👌🏼
Where has she gone? And why?....She gave me hope...
What if Michelle started doing makeup tutorials again. Don't get me wrong, this video was cool and all, by there was no point. We all know by now that Michelle's videos are very well edited, which I am always happy to see, but that's about it now. Just cool edits of stuff that doesn't have a point. Like girl, please go back to what everyone started liking you for. I didn't subscribe to your channel to see cool edits. I subscribed because I wanted see how to do a certain makeup look. Now it's just pointless videos of you floating around in a desert? Guess I'm gonna have to go somewhere else and find what I'm looking for. I'm looking for makeup tutorials Michelle. MAKEUP TUTORIALS!! I still ya girl, just please bring it back to the original Michelle. Happy that you've grown and all. Just once in while do a makeup tutorial. Please!!! 🙏
OMG WHERES MICHELLE ??
THE AESTHETIC 👏👏👏👏👏😭
tiny housee❤❤
This kind of video 2 years ago 
I means this is amazinf
Mich where are you?? You're other videos are now

is this were jessica jung filmed her fly mv?
I really miss this gal making videos!!! :( Mish was one of the first people I ever subscribed to on YouTube.
She was there when I went to upper school right the way through from start to finish I got my inspiration for my prom makeup from watching her, and then when it was time for me to start college I realised that everything I knew about makeup I had learnt from her! Every tip and trick! It's heart-breaking that she's taken such a long break from making videos :( PLEASE COME BACK SOON!!! <3 <3
You and Karen look so beautiful.
WHERE IS MICHELLE?! COME BACK PLEASE, WEVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG. IM GETING IMPATIENT 😭
she was just on Instagram live vid
I don't really comment like ever but that was fantastic Michelle! The shots and time lapse were amazing. you and Karen looked badass and beautiful. Sending positive vibes your way.
Michelle, I'm a little bit worried about you. You used to make make-up tutorials,but now you don't post as often and your videos are really sad,it's like your vids are how you're feeling. (i know that people have their own separate lives,but i want to know you're alright and happy). btw, 2016 is a very unlucky and bad year.
Michelle pls do a Snsd Tiffany Hwang makeup
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! We all miss you so much and hope you're having a great time!!!! ⭐️✨🌈⭐️✨🌈⭐️✨🌈⭐️✨🌈⭐️✨🌈⭐️✨🌈 
It's my birthday as well!! Hehehe
Michelle! where is that video you created about salmon salad?!?! i can't find it anywhere!!!
this is too much for youtube. congratulations! it was a pleasure to see this art.
RIP Mish 😑
What happened to her videos?
michelle v really miss you....y aren't u making videos
The editing is amazing as usual
Guys, I am more than sad to say this, but this is her reply to one of her comments on FB: 
-Does this mean you will do videos again?
Michelle: I think my next video on YT might be my last video, we'll see

SHE IS QUITTING YOUTUBE. NOOOOOOO, IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS MICHELLE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO US PLEASE. I HAVE WAITED YOU PATIENTLY FOR SO MANY MONTHS. I HAVE BEEN YOUR FAN SINCE XANGA DAYS, PLEASE DON'T ABANDON US. PLEASE DON'T.
It's been 10 months😓 nearly a year since you posted😭
I used to watch Michelle all the time, and now that I've stopped and started watching Dan and Phil (How I went from this to D&P idk) I can't focusing on her content because of her last name.
Yes I know I'm a bad person
Yo it be 9 months since she's posted. I'm worried, or maybe she's just busy
I just love your filming and the calm atmosphere of your videos. Keep it up! <3
ตามมาจากพี่นุ่น♡

im so proud of you!!! well done girl 💚💄
Why are u not posting anymore in YouTube 😭
This looks like Jessica Jung's Fly MUSIC VIDEO <3
I often don't comment on videos, but I really miss your videos and you saying good luck at the end.  You have some over the most original content on here that is different from the other. You helped inspire  my drive for makeup. I would be so excited when you posted a new video and now I am so much better from were I have started because of you. I am also so happy that you rebirthed em Cosmetics and successful!! I just hope you come back to the YouTube world because so many people miss you as well as I do 

xoxo Elise

Though I have no clue what these 'aesthetics' are, I have to say, the cinematography is absolutely divine.
I was looking through your videos and you've seem to have deleted a decent chunk of your vids, what gives?

can we just take time to appreciate this beautiful and cinematic content. Michelle definitely upped her game for the YouTube communitty. Im so proud of how far she has come.
this is the content im trying to create lol. anyone have any ideas as to what editing software might've been used for this?? everything looks so seamless and smooth!!
I'm living for these looks. The aesthetic is majestic! I support Michelle with whatever she's going through ~ just like any one of us she is an evolving being and she has a right to do whatever she feels is beneficial. She was one of the first youtubers that I subscribed too so she of course has a part in my heart. We can only hope that she's safe and happy and maybe one day she'll be back. Good luck on your journey Michelle :)

Muchos de tus videos se han borrado, Porqué?! Tú eres mi Gurú del maquillaje te veo desde que tenía cómo 11 años, recuerdo que el primer video que vi de ti fue el de "Tutorial of transformation Barbie" y de ahí me enamoré. Tal vez no me entiendas pero estoy muy triste por tus videos borrados y porqué ya no estás aquí en YouTube. Ojalá y estés bien, que todo se mejore para ti si la estás pasando mal. Take care so much... Te mandó todo mi apoyó y amor desde México. 

I love you Michelle♡you are my Queen of the Makeup, stay strong. Bye :c

So sad she doesn't post makeup GRWM/diy/etc. anymore like when she did back in the old days. I stopped watching her when she became a millionaire, it's just not the same anymore.
I'm speechless  😍
0:35 Is that a reference to the anne frank macbook video?
I miss her makeup vids so much
Okay, I actually wanted to cry as I wrote the previous comment. I feel sad for her. I really want her to be okay. And not "just okay", I mean REALLY okay.
How do you still have subscribers???
Am I the only one who thinks this reminds me of FLY by Jessica?
I miss you so much :'(
I didn't think about the fact that I could of had a baby since the last time Michelle uploaded lol. Miss you 😘
My favorite thing to was craft
When you gonna post

ODESZA!
Hey Michelle, such a beautiful video! Just out of curiosity, are you doing any more makeup tutorials or are you continuing with the new vibe? Love you so much and keep inspiring ❤️
Please post soon ♥️♥️♥️
Came back to this because it's so beautiful
michelle, I've loved your channel since the first video. recently I've been going through a lot because my husband got stabbed in the head saving my life from the person attacking me causing him to lose motion in the right side of his body I watch your inspiration videos to help remind me that everything will get better. you have also been my inspiration for my art and my reminder that no matter what I'm a beautiful person and when I have doubts and low self esteem I just watch a few of your videos and I feel better. I just want to say thank you
Oh my god yess
Miss you. You were the reason I got into makeup. I hope to see you back on YouTube soon I love you
Jk news uploaded a video of her explaining her battle with depression
I miss you so much 😟
WHY ARE SO MANY VIDEOS DELETED😭😭😭
OMG editing on fleek!!!!!
That timelapse tho😍😍😍😍
where are u plz come back😭😭😭😭
hey michele will u draw my life BC I feel like telling the world how I feel I'm Sakura an 11 year old I was born with a good family, but I left my mom a few days after my birth. It was until I moved to san Fran. I could barely remember where I went and lived. I grew to have a fond of art. My first ever drawing was of a flat Stanley. My friends bullied me secretly when I didn't know it. if I went down on this again, I would've been even sadder. to move into a closer detail of today is when I was 9. My aunt was terribly murdered by my own uncle. its hard rto explain the horrible death. I wanted to draw, but I made myself a fraud. I traced pics over the computer, then gave them to my friends. I ought it would make my friendship more pop, but instead it was ignored by most students. I still draw as good as I try to make myself feel better I still don't wanna make specific details BC I feel sad about my new life at my new school in Georgia.
This so tumblr
were have you been?
Where'd she go ?..
long time no see :(((
you don't deserve your 8+ MILLION subscribers. you dont even care or upload anymore...i upload weekly and have barely any subscribers..

Hey Mich!!!  where are you?? 😟
Yeah but where are your make up videos?
Tbh, idk what's going? It has been 9 months? I don't even know what's happening to her. I'm kinda worried. I know that she'll make a video about why she had been gone a long time. I miss her 😭
Where have you gone :( does anyone know? I can't find any videos explaining why she's not posting as many videos.... all my favourite youtubers never post anymore and it honestly makes me so upset 😭
Bae I miss your old channel like from years ago when you were uploading daily pls come back
i miss you
She said: "I'm sorry I've been away. In the world of " social " media, I found myself feeling isolated and alone. I felt broken and lost, so I took meaningful time away from the noise to piece together back my life. "

You've saved me in so many ways Mish. please be patient with yourself and know that we love you. We were all created out of love, and this is know you understand. So many things in my life have been a trial recently, I've been very sick and It was hard for me to see the light for a while. I pray for you in this adventure you are taking. I love you and thank you × a million stars for being an old soul💚
I miss you TT
I feel like Michelle Pham deleted the video where she was introducing her makeup line because people hated it 😂
I miss you mish but I'm loving Helios femina

Guys don't worry Michelle posted a live stream on Facebook saying she will continue to make videos soon:)

Imy Michelle 💓
We are not going to wait eternally Michelle ...
WE MISS YOU MICHELLE
I hope you are ok Michelle, we miss you!
You never post anymore! It's like u forgot about us
Is she youtube-dead?
This is Phantastic!
please another vid like this
She's been 7 months Michelle... we miss you! Hope to see a new vid soon!
michelle come back we miss u :(
I like this video. It leaves much to interpret, but I honestly miss her makeup tutorials. Of course, I could just look at the old ones, but I would love to see what new techniques and tips she has to share. I hope we could see at least one makeup tutorial this year, but I understand that you are busy with many things and I wish you well. I hope that when you do come back, you rekindle what made you so well known and respected. Good luck! 🤓
Michelle please re-upload the old videos you made if you still have them, your videos inspired me and made me happy.
I miss you a lot
Sending nothing but positive vibes your way hunny. See you soon.
SHE COMMENTED ON A INSTA PHOTO SHE WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR
How long did u have to sit on the chairs for the time lapse lmao
This is so beautiful Michelle!
we miss you,  michelle 😘😘😘😘😘😘
This video is beautiful.
0:33 my university fees are on that bed
You haven't posted since July or something
I miss you ☹️😓
I love your videos Michelle. They're so majestic and aesthetically pleasing and I feel like I understand you, your posts, and the things you learn. I don't think most your subs understand, they just keep asking for your old videos and the "old you". You've grown and keep growing, keep exploring and learning new hidden things. Those who understand you will be inspired, like me. I'm eager to learn what you've learned. You feel like a sister to me, I've read your manga and idk how to explain it but I feel connected in a way. You're so creative and you have a beautiful brilliant mind. You are unique and stand out and that's what I love about you. You are your own person, not a copy of everyone else. You are truly inspiring. I hope you see this 💗
I miss the old Michelle. She has changed so much😔
Michelle post more often. Like literally the last thing u posted was 8 months ago
I don't know why Michelle Phan's YouTube profile is black.
We miss you!
Did anyone see the comment she posted on this video explaining that her year was rough? For some reason it disappeared
I thought I didn't activated the notification bell that's why I stopped seing her videos!
ahhh where has michelle been?
We miss you michelle 💗
Like cyber goth and how to look like nana was it because they weren't popular it's so sad I have watched your vids sence your lady gaga one and vampire one I was looking for the glasses vid the one with cool wing but saw most of your vids are gone why is that??
#hỏiđức
She recently said on IG she had some stuff going on and will update ALL SOON!!!

for people concerned about Michelle : she is fine. she said she is gonna share all her experience and knowledge soon. so don't need to worry about her:) i hope you all understand  <3
Why is like all her videos gone, like i will literally die if she took them away cause like the video "how to have a fresh start" something like that. I really wanna see it and alot more of her videos. I was wondering why she didn't upload anything. Someone please explain ;-;
厉害了
So did she give up on YouTube? I hate when my favorite beauty gurus get popular and famous, they stop making content 😭.
Missing Michelle so much
So creative and artistic! It looks like a music video! At 1:44 Mish reminds me of the Mother of Dragons <3

Are you okay Michelle? You haven't made a video in a while. I hope all is well.
我爱你 我想你
Are you ok Michelle?
I loved her trend reports . I hope she's OK she hasn't posted and is deleting things

Please do a spring makeup tutorial please
Michelle were you aré????
her last name is to live for tbh
where'd you go?
When i think of michelle i think of the space and universe =)
Say the ipsy interview!
Check her twitter. The first week of May she said that she's in china working off of an internet VPN and has slow speed. She edited a video on the plane ride over and will upload as soon as she can get good internet.
Watching her whip out 4 laptops just annoyed me and made me feel bad about myself.
michelle please come back and make tutorials... i really miss u.... 😭😭😪😥😫😱😖😢
Where's Mish gone?!  😢
What happened to her she was such a great youtuber come back Michelle. :(
People complaining about this not being a makeup tutorial or having a point . . . .  😐😑

It's called playing around and trying new things and letting out some creativity 
If you don't like it don't watch more. Simple 
No need to be rude or ignorant 
Or spread any negativity 
Just simply leave if it's not your thing or you think she's "changed "
Omg where is that space themed bed cover from?
I think you haven't been posting because you're busy. No pressure. Following you on Twitter, but still miss you. We know you're wise!
Is she dead? where are u Michelleeeee Im missing your videos soooo muchhh

i miss you michelle. the queen of beauty guru. my one and only inspiration on youtube. please, come back!
Miss you Michelle! I hope you come back kicking and well!
Shes busy with a lot of stuff like her webtoon and buisness
I wonder when she'll make a new video...
WHY are you all complaining about her not making more videos.
LITTERALY nobody is concerned about her health?
Maybe is isn't feeling well and wants to take a break. What is wrong with you? If you are a true fan, can't you try to put yourself in her shoes? Ask yourself why she isn't making videos. maybe she is busy, maybe family problems, maybe she wants to take a break because of exhaustion? 
She is human aswell like we all. Just try to not only ask but also to give and to show some love and caring.

Just think a bit before judging and give this girl a break.

peace.
Michelle???
I'm kinda worried about Michelle. Her photo isn't all black, look closely there is some kind of mandala. But she hasn't posted in forever
Queens <3
*cries* Michelle I want you to know...when I first started watching YouTube 6 years ago, you were the first YouTuber I subscribed to and ever watched. You helped me become the young lady I am today. I had no one to teach me anything about beauty and the world. I thank you for it, please don't leave...I love you <3

It almost is like sometimes youtubers who are super famous go on hiatus, but forget about the people who made them sucessful, I love Michelle Phan, and wish she would post more on this channel, and I know that she is working on her brand and everything, and this isn't directly at all to her, I just wanted to put it out here in the world. No hate LOVE MICHELLE

I love all your videos but we need some more with makeup tutorials..

Michelle :(
Almost been 10 months. am I the only one who goes on her channel every single day waiting for a video. Michelle you're letting us down and we are worried about you I hope all is well but if you aren't doing videos any more please tell us because everyday I go on your channel to see nothing new. yet you're still active on everything else on social media. you have 8 millions subscribers I am sure many would love to have that many subs. so don't take us for granted. and if something is going on please tell us because I am worried and slightly disappointed... Where are you MishyMoo😭;(
I was wondering why she deleted those videos. I'm actually glad she did. She left the kind of videos I missed, the old Michelle. hopefully when/if she returns she'll go back to the old Michelle
cool ✨
i miss the cutesy, bubbly, bright videos
i love you guys
I wonder how much$$ she settled for back in the day with  the lawsuit with Ultra records
She was and still the best beauty YouTuber she started since 2007 and she worked so so so very hard , I've known michelle's Channel since i was very young , to hell with these new beauty guru nikkie and her gang. I miss michelle so much
Michelle why did you stop making videos??
Two hot girl very beautiful
Omg the last time I came 2 years ago I saw her UNICORN bedroom vid. She's only posted 9 vids since then
Come back
I miss seeing her makeup tutorial videos...

This is soo pretty!
... Still waiting.
I still visit her and talk to her because I love them both
i've been checking your channel every now and then. i miss watching your videos. you are my first favorite here in youtube. i hope you'll be back soon.

THIS WAS JUNE LAST YEAR CAN SHE PLEASE POST I MISS HER
My family bring Disney to Ho Chi Minh city
Anyone remember when mish did makeup videos?
Why doesn't she post anymore?
I love this video so much
Where have you gone Michelle?
I miss her voice overs on her actual makeup tutorials and her makeup tutorials 😩 what happened??
where did she go ? 💔
I found out a music company is going to sue her for 7.5 million dollars for playing their music in the backroad of 50 of her videos without permission
Did she die? ( I'm kidding)
When is she!! She hasn't been posting since June?????? What's wrong
I miss u
Wheree are you Michelle?
I miss you a lot michelle!! My life has been a crazy roller coaster and watching your old videos made me think about that time when i was in 5th grade living with my parents. memories.
....
for anyone who is confused on why she isnt on her channel and changed her profile pic, theres nothing to worry about! Her profile pic is her makeup business logo. Im guessing she hasn't been on her channel for so long is that she's been focusing on her business right now. Her website of her business will come out on April 17th.
Where are Michelle ?? 😢☹️☹️
Michelle!!!! What happened?!? Why did u delete all of your recent videos and changed the banner art and your profile picture? Is there anything bad that has happened?! 😫 we care for you and this is worrying me 💔💔
GET BETTER MICHELLE 💕💕 WE WILL BE HERE FOR YOU
honest she was blowing um and now after she stopped posting often its like who's Michelle phan
Y don't u post any more
Why did you delete your Fantasy Look? It was my favorite video?
Please stop looking for a "point" in this video. Just enjoy! It's incredible.
Did the song change from the original? I don't remember this being the song
does anyone know when she's coming back she did a video with refinery that was posted a week ago on refinery i love her so much
It's been almost a year now.....
the way her friend is chewing gum and talking otp around 0:26 reminds me of Janette mccurdy. Am i right?
um so what is this about....? like is it fashion, make up or...?
maybe she never back on YouTube again becoz she only care and focus on her brand (company) I guess.
Where u at
Make money as you want ahieve your dreams and screw youtube. Wow thats a nice circle that everybody does
I want Queen back
this gave me chills
what happened to you mich? why are you not posting any more videos?
Why did you delete some of your videos??
I look up to Michelle, she was my idol. Seeing her gone makes me sad and worried. Please come back.
Make more videos it's been nine months
this is my favorite video of michelle :)
I love this video!!
gofundme.com/4rzjbb-life-dream
The first video i watched of Michelle was that zombie princess
Michelle, we miss you.
lmao okay take 6 months and probably more to upload a single video. this is why i unsubbed
I LOVE PLACES LIKE THIS omg
what happened mish?
For those wondering why she stopped uploading and changed her profile picture she was going through a depressing time for some reason from reading ALL of her depressing tweets from Twitter so if you want to know more just go on her Twitter
Cool video. But what was the point?
Hi I am from Vietnam to
hy guys we are a new channel and just made our second video can you please support us?
why she go?
This vid makes me want to cry... lysm Michelle! Do what you want, don't make videos just for your fans and subscribers, make them when you want to and when you don't feel pressured! lysmmmm
If you really cared about your followers then you would at least tell us that you want to take a break and not just disappear pit of nowhere. Dont forgot without your followers, you wouldn't be where you are now. I know those who believed in you will understand but its just very insensitive I guess.
Where'd you go?
Two months ago she promised that she'd make an update video soon.
I like the set.
can you do a helious femina tutorial? Inspired looks.
you guys made her rich and famous. That being said she left. She used us! she's made enough to retired. it's call reality!
I love her so much,I've been watching her ever since I was 9 years old :") but ever since she got kinda inactive I forgot about her for a while,I suddenly thought of her and came back to watch her new videos and to see that she still wasn't posting 😪. I really hope she gets back on posting daily. I miss her and her videos😩
is she alive
I miss her old videos and it's been almost a year since she's posted
I miss her old videos and it's been almost a year since she's posted
Thanks for abandoning your subscribers.

She doesn't post anymore
Michelle we all love you so much and look up to you! please come back to youtube soon!
Michelle please come back!
So sad for u to treat ur subbies like this.
Michelle please come back!
so where she at its almost been a year.. I dont think its ok for her to leave her supporters like that :/
michelle please come back 😭😭😭
Michelle come back :(((
I loved her channel, but since she hasn't posted in 6 months she clearly isn't taking youtube seriously anymore and I'm specific to who I'm subscribed to. Sorry, but until you're posting again on the regular, I am unsubscribed.
what happened to michelle
dang it's been 9 months
Where have you been girl ?!?
Where did you go
Thanks for the consistent uploading, Michelle. We really appreciate it. It's not like we got you here or anything.
Reminds me of a pretty little thing ad
9 months..
Can you try the bye bye foundation
Michelle please please please please please please please.. please upload few videos.. It's been a very long time.. We love you so much 😍😍
where are you?
😍😍
Where is she? Hasn't uploaded in 6months 😞😞😢
Why aren't you doing any videos !?? It's been a long time
What happened to her?
Where are you??
Y did she stop making videos Michelle I'm disappointed
I know she's rebranding her makeup line -- that probably no one really has an interest anymore, but damn 9 months since she's uploaded a video!? I didn't think it had been that long!
Where are you Mish? We really miss you
If you want to know what is happening with Michelle and if your actually care, do some digging. I have only looked at this video and the comments and did les than 5 minutes if looking about and found out she is getting ready to launcher her new cosmetics line - EM Cosmetics - the new profile pic is her logo and if you notice part of her banner picture on her Google page.

Lesson? Stop being so triggered and actually find things out before typing useless "omg" or "is she dead" etc. Life is too short to be so basic.
A mother and daughter take a witchy camping trip
Where are you?
Why don't you post anymore
Where do you live
Michelle are you dead ?
I miss her...
This is STUNNING the camera angles and lightings , combined with beautiful visuals and aesthetics ,the music and speeds of movement all come together to create i think the most nostalgic and aesthetically pleasing videos ive ever seen 🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕
What is wrong she said dark times what
you took down quite a few of your videos!! why??
michelle has deleted much videos from her channel ?? why ??
I so miss you people in my life only talk shit and you can't have a serious conversation like a barrier, you can only say things that make other laugh, no real thoughts
She hasn't made vids in ages has she stopped

Waiting for her to get back to her Channel

Why doesn't she post anymore?
why isn't Michelle not making any videos?
TT i miss you
She's probably deceased
hey Michelle, if you see this. I really hope what ever you're doing now is what you want and that you're in a good place. I miss you and your soothing voice aha. really hope you're well and doing what you love. best wishes :) x
Where did she go? 😭
Still waiting for a new video...
Why does she always so look so sad.
I just came back to see Michelle been watching her for years... she the bomb diggity, more than makeup
Is Michelle alive?
omg why she is like that 🙊😱 I mean 8 000 000 000 subs and I now michelle phan 2 years old 😁🙊
Hey everyone! Michelle is fine. She finally updated, I think in an interview or something saying she's been in a self-diagnosed depression for a year. It hit her after Em Cosmetics fell through with Loréal. She felt like she spent so much of her life just hustling she never got the time to truly find herself and see the world and stuff. Now she wants to be behind the scenes focusing on her brand and things rather than in front of the camera. :) Hope this kinda helps anyone else rewatching her videos cause they miss her.
WHERE DID SHE GO
Please come back soon! We love you!
Where have you been mishelle ? We miss you so much :(
Did you die
Breaking Bad

Hello Michelle. I just wanted to say marry Christmas or whatever you celebrate. I LOVE your videos and I'm eager for you to come back!! For Christmas I got an ipsy subscription and make up brushes. I think you'll be happy that an ipsy subscription is what I wanted most! We want you to come back, and thanks for the always awesome advice!!
Hey! I have these friends and they are the only ones i've ever to be able to get close with. But I am Buddhist and they are Christen and they don't seem to respect my belifes like I do for them. But I don't want to lose them.. im still in school and if I do lose them, I wont have anyone. I just need some advice ^3^
Please comeback ☹️
Is she still alive orrr ...
Why hasn't she posted in ten months?
I love Michelle so much, but she only posted like 5 videos in 2016
People said that she deleted a bunch of videos featuring em makeup because she's rebranding but idk alot
Her face changed so much she looks pretty both ways just amazed at the difference
Twaimz, now her!?
Dear Michelle maybe you will read this maybe not. I am 43 yrs old and always enjoyed your videos because they were and are, art. As an artist, you will outgrow depression and be larger after it. Because you are unique, this is why everybody watched your lovely videos. Hopefully soon you will be able to maybe enjoy everything youve worked so hard for, and after that, the greatest of all- the challenge of motherhood. Am sure you have people who love you around you, who will support you in this and that. Be strong and stay strong, hope to hear your soothing voice soon again. You will grow taller than the clouds that seem to put you down! Greetings from greece+hope to be able to guide you through the wonderful greek islands anytime you want.
I've watched Michelle sense she started on her webcam and she was my first YouTube video ever watched. I remember being to fascinated by this world of Youtube. To see Michelle grow her company and seeing all of it has been amazing to watch a girl who was out exporting the world to finally find what she loves. I love you Michelle and always will ❤️
I love Michelle so much. .
Is she still active
why isnt she posting?
My name is coco
Is this where Jessica's mv was shot?
Guys michelle isn't hacked she even liked a video 3 days ago
what is this? i want to draw every frame
Nostalgia...
Would love to connect with some of you guys on here!
I've just realised how sad it makes me thinking of someone I adore (or even know) who distances themselves and well, disappears. I know she's still around, but I feel like she isn't. God, sometimes I hate social media.
where is she?!
I miss her so much :( and no I'm not being that annoying person who can't cope with a person growing up and changing, that's fine. But I miss the constant/not super HQ videos where she'd do a dope look or talk to us. That's the shitty part of life. You want your idols to soar but once they do they leave you.
Where is michelle?
Where did she go
greats
I'm so mad she fell off the face of the earth
I followed Michelle on her first videos (make up tutorials etc)
she has changed a lot since this old time. The artistic of her videos are very nice.
But her natural way miss me...
Michelle.. I'd like to start off with a huge Thank You for all of your hard work and to anyone who has helped you. I've usually lurked in the background of your videos and was more of the quiet audience all these years and saw you blossom so much and to see what you have achieved is amazing and inspiring❤ but.. you've gone now; and I understand you may have your reasons and may you and your family be alright, but let us know just something to give us peace of mind. So many are very worried and just saddened by your absence. In the mean time of your hiatus, I shall be watching your videos and try to instill much of what you've shown us.  

Good Luck, Michelle💕
Happy Holidays ❄
OMGGGGGGG WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUU IM SO SAD AND SCARED OMGGGG
u lost 2 m subs, mish
I am missing u Michelle!!!!!!!😪😪
What happen to your channel why theres a lot video that are gone and why you never posted again??
Mitchell if your reading this 
I hope your life if going great im not fussed that ur posting im just hoping your ok dont give up no matter what is going on take your time
Michelle where are you?!!!
is she still alive
any helios femina webtoon fans out there?
1 year ago today!
as much as I miss mish's videos, you guys have to understand that she's a business woman and has companies like ipsy and her makeup like to take care of. She's a grown woman now and perhaps she's not interested in making YouTube videos. That's what happens with growth, things change and you grow out of things. I'm not exactly sure if that's why she hasn't been on YouTube but it's understandable if she is. She's almost 30 she can't stay on YouTube forever!!!
Did you die
She looks like cheng xiao
why did she delete her videos
Why is her profile pic black
Why doesn't she post anymore
IAMKARENO!!!
Stop whining and go to her Facebook page. And please get a life. Thanks.
I wonder if any of YOU IN THE COMMENTS know any creators making videos similar to this? I would looooove to know of them!
I'm so obsessed with this video - I watched once a day, and I'm so sad you deleted the trend report with the baby girl trend, cus that video had a similar cool vibe as this one and so awesome. I hope you'll make more in the future!
This was beautifully done
what's happening w mish?
where are you??
why is there just 141 videos ???? are you deleting it??? what's going on?
michelle whats going on
I miss her videos
It's honestly so stupid to me that Michelle puts so much effort into her videos, but people will still go ahead and dislike them. Like wtf.
Where's Michelle
Does anyone know why Michelle has been gone off of youtube for a long time ?
Hi michelle ????♡♡♡ I am your fan since the year of 2014

Yea this is a waste lol 2 min video of them posing lol wow so disappointed that's my opinion so I don't fans checking me over my opinion
2019
She deleted so many of her old videos :(
I really want to see more of your old videos, I saw that a lot of them got deleted. are they ever coming back, or is there another place i can find them ? :(
Did Mitchell like quit YouTube?
If there are no more vids I'll unsubscribe
I can completely understand youtubers taking a break (however long they desire) especially when something awful happens, but I really wish they wouldn't delete or make any of their videos private. In her case, in maybe a legal issue. I sure hope not. I wish you the best Michelle and hope these darks times don't have to do with Dom or your mom or sibling.
Where did Michelle go for 7 months?
Thought it was a makeup tutorial
oh my god michelle come back! I'm pretty sure everyone misses you and your videos!

I don't know if it's the music or the video, getting emotional vibes... to be honest; the mix of both made this so beautiful and peaceful? Somehow a litte bittersweet, who ever filmed this really knows how to capture beauty in the simplest things and ofc, girls, you're so pretty😍❤

I have watched this so many times it's ridiculous
What editor software did she use? It looks so cool!
does anyone know where her bed covers are from< they are awesome!
Michelle, although this is probably going to be on the bottom of the comment section, and no one will read this, but I really miss your old videos. I love you so much now too, with your trend reports, mastering the art of, and pillow talk, but remember when there used to be so much more? That's what I miss. Your Favorites videos, beauty basics, gift guides, makeup tutorials.......I just wish there was more vairety of videos like that. I still love your videos, and I get you are more mature now, but......idk..💞
what is this? I don't understand it?! a music video or fashion video or lifestyle video... please, PLEASE tell me... :? :? :?
Do any of you know where this video was shot at???
Is she dead? Someone tell me what is happening
Michelle that was beautiful! You have grown so much and I'm very proud of your work!!! 👏🏽👏🏽😘
I was wondering where you get your Big circle contact lenses from and if it also has lenses for astigmatism. Let me know whenever you have the chance. Love your channel <3

Kawaii hipster😍

+Michelle Phan do you know Jonathan Park he's my cousin he said he used to work for u with the camera
Hi, guys 😊 Mish is receiving a lot of hate lately. And I can barely see good comments on every type of video that she makes. Maybe, some of you know me already, 'cause I literally comment on most of Mish's videos! Just so you know, please don't fight with Mish's haters! Why? A true dreamer (meaning a fan of Mish) DOESN'T fight with others. If you see a hater, just talk to them in a nice way.Don't say any foul words or hurtful statements. I fought with Mish's haters before on Instagram. Mish said, "Don't let others who choose to misunderstood you upset you. People fear what they don't know. Sometimes, the road to truth is paved with mysteries. Everyone has their path". So, it's actually normal (in this generation) from someone to hate. I'm not agreeing to hate, but this is reality. People will always find and find a reason to hate someone. So, if you're a dreamer...don't feel bad for anyone who hates Mish. It's THEIR path. What Mish wants us to be is a  dreamer. 😊
I LOVE watching your videos! You are very inspiring and helpful! :3
This clip is extraordinary😍🙌
pretty but came here for a makeup tutorial
This video screams aesthetics
oh my god she played a song from odesza!!! ahhhhhhhhh im dying
This is so cool, but I really miss your makeup videos :(
Although you don't post as Many beauty videos anymore, I still love your videos, this is probably one of my favourite videos, it's so artistic and inspiring and I have to thank you for it 💙🔮
This is so beautiful
She is nominated for a teen choice award but where are are her weekly videos
This could have been the music video just great
This looks like Nevada
OMG IM SO HAPPY SHE USED THIS SONG
this looks better than a ton of music videos out there omg
I love this video
I love these creative videos!!!! Tips and makeup tutorials... you have tons of them and everyone can make those, they get repetitive. Beautiful and creative shots like these are really inspiring. You two are gorgeous queens!!!!!
I miss your old videos
So obsessed 😌 if anyone knows any similar videos, with nice music no talking please please please let me know!!!
What's the point in this video ?
What music is this？
i read this as final fantasy and freaked for a sec bc she used to do a couple of makeup looks based on the characters. i'm a little disappointed
You always have the most beautiful people in your videos. I just love the diversity.
Age, Sex, Race. I don't know how more diverse and all inclusive this video can get its amazing
That guy is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. How does he have such perfect skin? Is he real or a hallucination?
2:04 that boy is BEAUTUFUL.
She looks so unhappy, I just hope that she is finding happiness now
Yay for the diversity! And not just in terms of skin type and tone. Age, gender, nationality!
Why everyone talking about "I miss the old you," like what?? Y'all need to chill! I been a faithful follower since before Landcome snatched her cute ass up and I have never once thought, oh my god, can Michelle stop for a second and do exactly what she did 1 year, 2 years, 5 years ago? Like damn, it's called growing up. It's called having the right to post whatever you want. As far as I'm concerned, she inspiring as hell and has taught me so much since I was a lil 8th grader putting cocoa powder on my cheeks, putting egg whites on my face, and now learning bout cushion compacts. Instead of complaining, maybe try to accept that you can't control people, no matter how "perfect" they "used to be" in your eyes. Simply let them be and learn from it? Haha idk just me, I think she's great the way she is posting the videos she posts.
1:14 GIRL YOU ARE NOT PALER THAN A GHOST LIKE ME, DON'T PLAY
You have the most beautiful voice.
The quality of your videos, like nigahiga's, really prove quality over quantity. Rather than just sitting at the same spot, reviewing products, and blabbering throughout the entire video, you actually give so much effort into the details of the video! Both of you are definitely legends, and the top you tubers of all time <3
It was so lovely seeing the diversity in skin tones, skin types and gender 💙 Love how in depth and informative the video was too! x
I love the amount of diversity in this video.
After watching "Why I Left" you can clearly see how unhappy, almost dead her eyes were. I feel so sad that she had to go trough all that sh.t. She is such a beautiful, unique, precious soul, she should never be let down by anything. We need more people like her, not like some "celebs" of this time.
The person who had dry skin had the best eyebrows and eyelashes! 😍
Your videos are flawless but I miss the old ones that were focused on you.
The guy in this video is flawless omg
MICHELLE I LOVE YOU. The diversity in this video was BEAUTIFUL.
Love the new video and how informative it is! For a makeup newbie like me, this is so helpful! Literally someone told me I need to learn how to contour because the lighting in my kitchen makes my face look flat. Lol! So true, so now I must learn. I miss seeing more of you in the videos though! xx
I just watched her video as to why she returned. And I also read the comments berating for making it seem just like an advertisement, which I agree with to a certain extent. But looking at her at the beginning of this video, I can almost see the unhappiness. If I were in that room it could possibly even be palpable. I think, while most of us can't run to another country, I believe she really was helping her well being. Because here I really do believe I see someone suffering.
This video had more diversity than most Hollywood movies.
Love the diversity in this video :) Everyone is so beautiful bare face <33
When even the lighter shades are too dark for you... God damn I'm white as paper
Kudos on the wide range of models in this vid. They were all so beautiful and some literally took my breath away. Love to see all ages and skintones :)
Love ya girl you haven't posted in forever post more often love watching you
OMG your flipping the sponge tip is GENUIS. I've been using these since they first came out... AND NEVER THOUGHT TO DO THAT!!!!

I dont think you need makeup because ❤️you are already pretty ;)
I can't imagine how much work was put into this. I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND YOU! <3
2:30 he is one beautiful human being
Your vids are always works of art.  I'm such a massive fan of yours. ❤️
I love that your models are so diverse. This channel has truly become a universal beauty spot :D
YOUR VIDEOS LOOK SO PROFESSIONAL! THIS IS QUALITY CONTENT YA'LL!
That first tip was already a great tip. I immediately flipped it :P
Korean skincare & makeup really is blowing up so much. But it deserves it bc everything is so good
that boy's skin is flawless, wtf. what is life
Just what I needed! Looked up some of these products a few months ago. Thanks Michelle.
love seeing the diversity ! you should totally get a hijabi for your next video!
I wish I could try the authentic Korean bb creams but with my skin tone that's just not gonna happen lol
Every cushion I try makes me break out. I think is because they grow bacteria so fast but im not sure :( , somebody knows if they're hygienic?
The beauty community is lost without you! Please come back :( WE MISS YOU MICHELLE
Thanks for the tips 🌙🌸
To be Honest why are people Suscribed to Laura Lee or Manny mua  and James Charles so do people not watch Michelle phan anymore

I LOVE how informative you are. Because of this (along with many other things) you were always my favorite channel to watch when it came to all things makeup. Love you!
No hate but I miss the videos where it was just michelle and no one else
This is so helpful, thank you
❤You're such a good girl
Wow the boy's model skin was SO PERFECT fml
missing you so much😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Michelle, you have the perfect voice for ASMR......if you ever considered doing a video I am almost certain that it would be well-received.  Just an idea......
To: that guy

SLAY HUNTY, S L A Y.
I find these videos very informative and helpful, thank you for that. But honestly, I don't enjoy watching other people in your videos when I came here to see YOU (
I love you so much girl ❤️❤️❤️Such a gorgeous video
Loving how much diversity is in this ❤️
I love these videos! But I also miss the constant makeup tutorials, a healthy balance of both would be ideal 💖
sulwhasoo is really useful!
but a bit expensive
Yay! We got to see your face in the intro!!!
Wow Michelle, you're hair looks amazing.
Your videos are always amazing! <3
This was so good! I need to try Lancôme!
Tbh just use your beauty blender...you can turn any liquid foundation into a cushion compact by using it with wet sponges
I PRESSED ON THIS SO SO FAST I MISSED YOU MICHELLE!!
That guy for the dry skin part looked oily af
I was so glad to have found Korean Foundations, a few yrs back and I love the Cushion CC's.
Yes, I am Fair, I had a bit of a tan  happening in that photo in my profile.
I love how much diversity you showed in one beauty video <3
WE NEED A SKIN CARE ROUTINE FROM THAT MANZ
This video is diversity goals. 👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
this was so helpful☺
Great video as always <3
Love all the models in the video :)
Well this was extremely politically correct
the eyebrow goals in this video tho !
try out the 100% pure air cushion foundation :D
i really love your new hair colour it looks amazing on u <3
Good thing that you're back again Michelle. 😊 I've been waiting
This was actually super helpful. Thank you!
The fact that there was a guy in this vid made me sooo happy
Like,nowadays is common to see guys wearing makeup,but some people are against it.Glad to know your not one of these people! xo
That guy that was "modelling" for dry skin is beautiful...
I love how informative this video is! Can't wait to try a cushion compact
Not gonna lie, after watching this I went out and got a cushion compact lol
Do we need to apply primer before applying the cushion compact
I that girl is whiter than a ghost, then I'm whiter than a flashlight beaming light into your eyes. 0_0 Seriously, she's considered tan to me.
I am LOVING your new videos. They look so professional and aesthetically pleasing. I feel so happy when I watch them, thank you for all of the hard work that you put in!!
you should do more ASMR videos c:
Mish, what's your skin care routine? Your skin is so beautiful :) really missed your videos a lot! Hope you snap more!
I always support you. Love you!
loving all the diversity in this vid!  <3
I am in <3 <3 <3 with the diversity in this video! I feel represented!!! 
Favorite video, Michelle! I was thinking of getting cushion compact too.
You're incredible Michelle! I love the different models and your amazing editing 😍😍😍😍 I can't stop raving 'bout you.
I lovvvvvvvve yoooou soooo much , pllllzzzzz post more vediooooossss I miss u 😭 when I see ur vedios I feel happy 😍
The guy has the most perfect skin 😍
Keep up the good work Michelle! But i would really like to see you more in the videos
I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin so I love the Clinique one it leaves my face feeling and looking flawless without making me break out in hives
I love you Michelle, this is just the video I needed! Hope you continue to do well! xoxo
could you make a skincare routine video ? but with only you in it...
I love Iope Air Cushion for my dry skin! Although the darkest shade is slightly light for my skintone, I end up bronzing and powdering in my t-zone to match.
I have the Laneige BB cushion (not the new one) in shade 23 and it's one of my most treasured makeup products!
My skin type is a mixture of oily/combo/acne prone but I do have to use a green based primer and powder (that helps with oily skin)
Plus: my primer, bb cushion AND powder all have added SPF :)
Lastly: Although it is a bit pricey ($30+USD/$60+NZD), it DOES come with a REFILL! :D
the things michelle did is viral and becoming a trend now.i love a queen who started everything
damn so much effort into this video, much appreciated<3
Please teach me how to do my makeup!
YAAS MICHELLE FINALLY <3
I miss your make up tutorials 😥 I still love these videos tho 💖
the girl that is representing oily skin has the most beautiful hair!!
You're back finally !!

that girl has acne? 
oh hell no, she doesn't know what acne looks like mine is so bad that all the cushion fundations in the whole world couldn't cover it :3
I miss the old Michelle phan 😞 She's so matured nw  -just saying
I have missed seeing you in a video Michelle :)

i miss your makeup videos, please make more^-^- no pressure
that boy is an angel👏😍
oi Michele amei seus vídeos sou do Brasil 😍
OMG i was looking for a dark skin cushion foundation (so u know the struggle) and i found you and this video: THIS IS GENIOUS!!! The content is FULL u give all what we have to know and the aesthetics are FLAWLESS i subscried girl!
OMG! Your hair Colour is like Tzuyu from Twice's dark green hair!
This video is just too beautiful 😥
I get that she has other responsibilities but she posts so infrequently now that I sometimes forget I'm even subscribed to her. Her channel seems more impersonal now, too.
@vicmram those eye lashes ♥-♥
This was so helpful
My goddess! I love you Michelle! 

and am I the only one who thought of Edward Avila during this video? oh that would be a collaboration I would love to see!!!! 🤗🤗
This was sooo helpful! 💜
What's the background music called? It's sounds amazing!
aaa i love your hairr <3
When I rewatch your video after watching your "Why I Left"  video.I can see the sadness from your eyes.
u seem really sad cheer up gurll i love u ur an inspiration
Cushion compacts.. nothing new then :D Been using ones from IOPE, Hera, Etude House, Missha and many other Korean brands for two years now
That Latina model is BEAUTIFUL
Nobody does this kind of quality video anymore. I miss her. I hope she is happy, wherever she is❤❤❤
ive legit been watching you since you did that barbie makeup tutorial xD
OOH please do a reaction to your old videos! I was watching some of your videos from 2009 for nostalgia sake, and it's so crazy see how much you have grown since then❤️
Michelle has always been a life saver!! It was so difficult finding the right shade cushion compact. Thank you so much for the brands recommendation! I didnt know face shop carries several shades.
Absolutely LOOOVED the diversity in this video!! Also this was really informative, it's obvious so much thought and research was put into this. I love Michelle's old makeup tutorials, but these kinds of videos are super helpful and very specific which is awesome! Thank you Michelle :) Xoxo
Your videos are so beautiful
how do I know which type of skin I have? sorry for a stupid question I really don't know.
Are there any vegan/cruelty free cushion compacts out there?
It would be nice to see the art of moisturizing next ☺
I miss the old michelle and  her old channel 😣 @michellephan
I would love to try Cushion Compacts! Can you add it in an ipsy glam bag?
How do u clean the applicator? Do u just clean it like a u would clean a beauty blender or?
That guy's eyebrows are the most magical things I've ever seen in my life
please do mastering the art of pencil Eyeliner
Mish, may I know which Innisfree cushion that fits tan skin? I have tropical skin and used to have an Innisfree cushion, but it was still too white for me. 

Anyway thanks for this video, and by all means this really helps me! xoxo
Cushion compacts are innovation!!
i miss michelle so muuuccch
Love these informational videos! ❤️👏🏻
michelle will always be the best beauty guru
your voice is so soothing!
omg the outro is so magical and soothing
I'm pale af and don't appreciate being compared to a ghost. However, the diversity in this video definitely deserves accolade.
Yay new video!! Been waiting for this lol 💜
For acne and oily skin, there are : ac clenaup mild bb cushion and real powder cushion from Etude House !
Deutschland?😂❤️
Hi Michelle! Love the vid <3 May I know what's the mattifying spray that is used in this video? :)
how to clean the sponge
That guy at like 2:30 is so beautiful omg
where are you frommm :v =)))
she is back ♡
+Michelle Phan My face has an oily to combination skin type and I would LOVE to recommend the Chica Y Chico Mat Fix BB cushion (Black Compact). I live in the Philippines and the weather is hot and humid, the formula of the cushion compact is perfect for those who share the same skin type as mine. 😊
it's not safe to use milk of magnesia often
I wish I could find one with the combination of my needs, there's one for fair, dry skin but I need one that also has spf color correcting and for extremely sensitive skin.
I cannot even imagine that the product listed here for light/medium skin was actually used in this video, though. My skin tone is similar to the person in the video, and no Korean branded cushions have colors that are "medium" enough - their version of medium is our version of light.
ALL HAIL THE YOUTUBE QUEEN ♡♡♡♡♡
all the models in this video are so pretty!! ❤❤
What that girl doesn't have fair skin, my skin is nearly white
omg! i miss you Mich! 😻😻
Michelle you have such a beautiful voice. I haven't watched your videos in a while, but I started watching you over 6 yrs ago.
Beauty comes in so many different forms and not just one! I loved this
this helped me so much thanks mish!:)
I'm loving this mastering the art of series!! Keep it up Michelle!
I love you and your videos 😘
Can you make a make-up tutorial for your next video? Other then that, I LOVE YOU!!! You are a great inspiration to me!!
I love this video <3 no age and gender discrimination :)
I recently has switch from foundation to cushion and I like it so much. My face look so shine!
I love that you've used so many different skin types and tones! And how you're really explaining everything to makeup dummies like me 😄
Why are you always so late with every trend
MICHELLES THE BEST
Love how you include diversity into your videos for a real representation! :) Hollywood should take notes
Love you so much😚😚😚😚
omg love all the people in this video! feel so good after watching it and seeing so many different models.
Cushion foundations actually originated from Japan...
You're the first beauty guru on youtube that I watch.
Anyone else notice how on point vicrams eyebrows are ? 👌🏻👌🏻
the color correction is so 'gimmickie'... (or whatever the spelling is)
I'm really enjoying the Physician's Formula cushion compact.  It works well on my skin and has SPF 50!
LOVE THIS MICHELLE!
Can you review the ANLA foundation ?????
another mastering the arts of ?? pls pls pls
can u make more makeup tutorials  please
You inspired me to get one!! Thank you Michelle! I've been watching your videos for 7 years and I have never been dissatisfied by any videos! Love from Canada
SHE SAID PROTIP SHE SAID PROTIP SHE SAID PROTIP DON'T CRY CRAFT SHE SAID PROTIP SHE SAID PROTIP SHE SAID PROTIP DON'T CRY CRAFT
my tzone area is always dry and the rest of my face is oily
This video is so relaxing, the editing and her voice is so soothing
Ru still together with Dom?
ILYSM 🌙🌸
Is she still dating Dom?
im pretty clueless is she still dating her boyfriend? i think it was daun. cant spell his name my apologies
I so needed this video!  It answered all my questions.  Thanks Michelle!
wow! this is very  informative! !
She is so overrated
Very helpful thanks.
Thank u for featuring diversity ❤️👏
love this!
I feel like she changed so much, like she doesn't care about her YouTube videos anymore, what a shame...
Yes, Mish finally back to this hairstyle! I love it!
I hope it inspired you to find your best cushion compact. aww so cute X'D I love mish
michelle can you make a video that show us how to edit video???
I love how everyone in the comments is so positive❤️
Bb cushion has been out for 2+ years already... Such an outdated video.
I love how michelle promotes other youtuber like that. Way to go mish! Love yaaa! <3
promote cruelty-free product please Michelle,  you have a such a big influence, you can change something !
Can you please do a video for Vocaloid makeup? I would prefer Rin Kagamine (if anyone bothers to read this you are probably baffled xp)!
I love your range of models!  😄
the lack in range of colors has nothing to do with it being new. makeup has been around forever and so has brown skin and dark skinned people. the lack of darker shades is blatant racism point black period. it's not like these cosmetic company forget that brown skin exist when they're creating their foundation shades. don't give me that bull shit
Amazin video !! Gotta buy that cushion compact
I love ur voice it's so soothing 😊
KARDASHIAN LOOK
Thank you! It help me alots
This video helps me a lot! Thank you Michelle <3
Could you make a video that throughly covers Korean skincare/products for people of different skin types/colours? I'm interested in testing out some products, but I don't even know where to start!
Michelle's face looked soooooo good in the thumbnail😍😍
Can u do more makeup tutorial I love ur makeup videos
Missed you💗
Another ASMR video? :-)

I love hearing that motivational ending "good luck" what's up you seem upset mish!?don't worry we're still hear for you!!and ur calming sweet voice is all I want to hear!ur amazing!!!
OMG i thought they had make-up on! They're so beautiful! Love the diversity, Michelle! Keep up the good work!
THANK YOU SO MUCH TT^TT!! I've been looking at multiple youtubers and their reviews on cushions because it seems like I'm moving towards the benefits cushions give. I have been using bare mineral's matte foundation, but my dry flakes seems to pop and my T-zone area gets hella oily. Bare Minerals is great, but it seems like korean products are doing the job on my skin. THANK YOU MICHELLE!! Super helpful :DDDDD
3:37 she looked like am I doing this right? 😂 but she's beautiful
wow, that's a beautiful boy
with a damn sponge? wat?!
Great job Michelle , thumbs up for you cause there are tons of Bb cushion review videos and yours is definitely the full gear one👍🏻   You always teaching us make up skills and cover different kinds of skin type and problem! Thank you!
+Michelle Phan can you make a video similar to this but for concealers?
+Michelle Phan can you make a video similar to this but for concealers?
Thanks, it really helps me for my grand dinner ! 🙌🙌🙌
I love Cushion Products but sadly there arent any cruelty Free Cushion Compacts out there... :(
If anyone knows a brand thats cruelty free and carries very pale shades please let me know!
Thank you ♡
Just discovered your channel and I'm in love with how you make your videos! I'm honestly entranced
to day, your make up look is so nice. Please have a tutorial !!!
This is so beautiful I could just watch it all day

Woah! loving the diversity!
this video is too professional not everybody have that flawless and brighten skin , i missed ur old naturel video when u show us all the imperfections and how u coverd them. but i'm still a fan ! fighting <3
It has been a long time since I watched one of your videos,  you have changed a lot
Flipping the sponge if genius! I loved my sponge for about a week but then the product settled. Now I flipped it and it's like new again!
Even the light cushion shades are to dark for me 😂
Hi Mish can you please explain why it's a good idea to wear foundation?
I love this series and I like how broad and helpful her latest videos are, but it has literally been 6 months since her last makeup tutorial and I really miss them
Still haven't tried cushion foundation but this video was full of useful information so it will be easy for me to choose the right cushion foundation for my skin type and need. Thank you! 😘😘
I LOVE YOU MICHELLE
Michelle, PLEASE DO A VIDEO WITH DOM!! WE MISS HIM!!

This was an awesome video! I really love and appreciate the diversity of folks in it! Keep up the amazing work!!

I just love the diversity in your videos ^_^ makes me realize how beautiful we are no matter what color of our skin <3

I have Estée Lauder cushion compact and its soooooo good  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 I survived 35 degree weather in Bangkok with it and it's great with cold and damp weather in England ! (I'm Oily combination skin and nc 30 southern Asian )
You look so beautiful in this video :D missed the the origin-embracing Michelle I love, who flaunts her roots, you've been americanising your makeup for a while, now you look amazing sporting that monolingual cat-eye Xxx
YSL!!

What about cleaning?  I clean my brushes but should I be cleaning the applicator in my cushion compact??
Michelle is back!! 💕✊🏼
Hi I'm medium skin and I bought the  Light/Medium Skin Face Shop Oil Control Screen Cushion. It  is too white for me. The model is even darker than me. :|

Everyone has such nice skin in this video!!

I'm korean so I like this video (sorry I can not English well😢)

Really love your videos! Stay beautiful 💖
can you please do a makeup collection? please?
the boys brow waaas  liiife !!!
I miss your old kind of video...
I love cushions!! I apply mine on the subway if I'm running late and it saves a lot of time. I use the Iope one and it's been great ^^
Love you Michelle 😍😘😘
Can you da star butterfly makeup
loving how diverse this video is!!
Too bad cushions that are reasonably priced and good are not for dark skin.
Say no to Lancôme!
The guy with dry skin has such nice eyebrows
Your videos were so good and now you've changed
honestly i'm so grateful for coming across these bb cushions. They're literally the only foundations that fit my pale skin. It's a shame they don't have more options for darker skin.
Mish, The Face Shop has one for oily skin. It helps enough, especially for someone with incredibly oily skin like I do (in under an hour, I already look greasy); their Oil Control Water Cushion. It lasts a few hours longer. :)
0:40 PROTIP
Can you do a Mastering the Art of Cream Eyeshadows?????
routine video plss hehe
I might have to give cushion compacts another try. My first dip was a few years ago and it was just too dewy, but I think the US now has more options. Thanks for all the tips!
Michell phan what is your first video?
You're videos just aren't as inspiring as they used to be. :(
Protip!
Are there any compacts without anything in them you know of so i can add my own product?
It inspired me to be me <3
I love this video it's so helpful and thank you for giving us these tips and showing us the different brands
how do you clean the sponge that comes with the compact?
could u tell mewhat you do with combination skin? i couldn't listen that part
is the l'oreal lumi cushion good for oily skin?
Which cushion compacts are really pale and really yellow toned bc all the ones I find are too pink for me😩
I thought the thumbnail was a drawing
What I'm wondering is: What is the best way to clean your applicator?
Beautiful video, Mish - I love that you really tried to cover all of the extremes without while still keeping it a short and sweet introduction. I'm not sure that the cushion is for me with very fair, oily and acne-prone skin, but I haven't ruled it out ;) I'm curious about the sanitary aspects - one way I've managed to curb my acne is to wash any foundation brushes/sponges after every use, but that seems like it would waste a lot of product with these, and you likely have to touch the sponge to the cushion repeatedly during 1 application. Is that a problem people have encountered, or are there some special properties to the sponge/cushion to combat this? Thanks in advance!
lol did any1 notice that every1 was wearing white hahaha
This is extensively researched and brilliantly executed! Learned so much Michelle 😘😍
i need to try this :)
Milk of magnesia is an effective mattifying agent for your skin but it is harmful for your skin.
me too, I really like and appreciate the new videos, but I miss michelle 😿
The last woman is vegan!
love your video so much 😍😍😍😍😍
Solwhasoo is NOT good for combination and oily skin AT ALL!!!
Thank you Michelle. I miss youuuuuuuu
More vids like this
Love the variety of models in this!
Yaaaaaas, Michelle 👌
Laxatives on the face? wtf?

I love that you dont exclude anyone <3
this video is so helpful!!  ilyyyy
Mamonde's cushion is really good for oily skin
I love the new direction her channel has taken. The aesthetics are unbelievable, and I love to see her more quirky, spiritual, dreamer side :)
I can’t find a single flaw with this video.

+ all these people are so beautiful I’m speechless~
i want you as the model not anybody else!!
ure my fave person love uu
🌙🌸 ILY MICHELLE!!
I love u mish!😘😘 I missed to attend bubz visit here in Manila but if u come here I will book a hotel just to see u xoxo
I watched this video last night, and when I went to sleep I dreamt that I was applying makeup with a cushion compact. Surprisingly, a very fun dream, now I want a cushion compact in real life.
When will you create make up tutorial again?
I love this type of videos.Showing all type of skin types and so much diversity.I love Michelle for doing this.
her last makeup video  was 8 months ago
i am crying
sorry
Seeing the brand name "innisfree" when you're Irish brings back a lot of English class memories
Good job in publicity §§ how much did u raise from that :3
I love your hair color so much.
i miss when you used to do makeup turtorials
🌙🌸
Mish is soooo gorgeous OMG i die
Do the full face of highlighters challenge please queen
Your face is so beautiful
I miss seeing more of you in make-up videos Michelle😏
I miss watching your makeup tutorials!!!
That guy's eyebrows are so awesome. Let him do my makeup!
I love cushion compacts. I bought the L'oreal one and I just toss it in my purse and use it for touch ups. Not great for people with oily skin or for people who want a lot of coverage. I have dry skin with little discoloration and it's perfectttttt.
OMG I m amazed that you uploaded introduction on Cushion compact as Korean. These are so commonly cosmetics in South Korea !! :)
This video is very good for people who wonder about Cushion compact to choice them!! Also subscribers who have a interest in details of Korean Cushion compact can give me message :)
I want to inform you guys about our great cosmetics!!!!
Any suggestion or tips on how to fix a cushion compact that may had lost its moisture?
wow she’s actually in a video for once
Your voice is so soothing
Your voice is so soothing
so in depth, and so helpful! TY Mish!
my skin extremely dry so which cushion is best fro me
Are any of these brands cruelty free? I love Korean and Japanese makeup but it's hard finding out if they're cruelty free a lot of the time :(
no reason not to love u Michelle! Great tips!
When u talk in your videos you sound so beautiful I wish my voice was as nice as yours
I love Michelle, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, but this is probably one of the best and most informative videos she's made in quite some time.
OK mish, I need help, so right now, the style of brow shapes are kind of a boxed shape, I don't like that shape, so can you please help me master the art of eye brow pencils?
1:40 OMG her skin tone is BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!
your voice is so relaxing
the Missha magic cushion is amazing!
Hi michelle. Would you recommend missha or a'pieu for oily/combination skin?
I love this series.
That guy's brows were ON POINT.
I never actually care what she is saying, I just love her calming voice! Anyone else?
OMG UR HAIR
🌸🌙 #instagramfam

And PLEASE don't show guys using makup!!! I'm sorry but let's show young people that man is a Man and woman is a Woman. thanks for understanding
2:09 damnnn those eyebrows on fleek

I love you Michelle :*

Thank you!

Hi Mich, what tone did mellbeauty use?
You can also make your cushion makeup for people who can't find their match.  I tried it and it works pretty well.
Teeth whitening tips video? I have a lot of trouble trying to keep my teeth white. 🙊
i love her videos, even after all these years, even if she does not use CF products and i don't use tested ones, i can't not watch her :'3 all my love, mish, keep growing <3
Is steve from promise phan and michelle are siblings tell me?!!??????
I actually like this format of showcasing and testing the products she is suggesting. Very helpful to see different people with different skin types and tones in the video. =)
I love the diversity in this vid!
More makeup tutorials! ;)
Hi michelle. How are you ?. I have a question: In which order you put your makeup on or you use your makeup products?
LOVE THIS
I love cushion compacts! I got a bunch when I was in Korea (:
I love ❤❤❤👏👏👏👏
Loved the video Michelle!! Now I have a question... As you use the cushion in each application, doesn't it get dirty or "contaminated"? Same thing with the product (foundation, bb cream...) love you!! 💜
Michelle!
Can you please do more makeup tutorials & showing us different looks/styles?
I think that's what everyone means by when they say, they miss the old you.
The last time you did a legit makeup tutorial was nine months ago.
The pillow talk, trend reports, and everything is all nice,
but I love you the most when you show us your makeup tutorials! (:
I myself don't like the l'oreal cushion foundation 

since Australia isn't a fan of cushion foundation therefore we don't have any cushion foundation products, so when I heard that L'oreal was launching one I was really excited but it was a huge disappointment. When I applied the foundation everything was good until around 30 minutes later, my face started to feel funny and I immediately washed all my makeup off. And lord... My face broke out horribly And I'm a combination skin.

this was 1 month ago (ish) and the acne/ pimple are still on my face (I don't use foundation on a daily basis)

but this was my experience everyone's skin is different so yeah..
Michelle, are these products cruelty free, or thats not a important factor for you?
I love these videos :D
I love it!! Thank you Mish 😙
You need to go backkkkk. Huhuhu. You need to save the beauty community. :(
I loved it Mish<33 ly lots.
miss u !
did you and Dom breakup
Love your hair here, mich! 😘
michelle is so pretty i would almost rather watch a video of her talking about cushion compacts so i can stare at her face <3
Miss you, michelle. <3
Love this video for featured different skin color and skin type! I do the idea of cushion compacts but I find they don't last on my skin and my face get very oily after 3 hours. However my friend who has dryer skin like cushion products.
...did-did she just... Make a Phandom reference?...
I'm currently loving the Clinque Super City Block™ BB Cushion Compact . I'm fair complexioned and combination skin type and the lightest shade offered matches perfectly. I love the semi matte finish and the SPF 50!
2:27 this guys face and nails are soo flawless :D
Does Mish do ASMR videos?
I love the diversity in your videos now, and I loved this video, but it almost seems like there's a disconnect now instead of the close personal feeling there used to be before
I'm unbelievably pale it's so difficult finding a cushion in my shade 😔
Such beautiful people!
mish!you forgot to mention innisfree long wear cushion for oily skin people.i swear it is the best cushion for super oily skin people like me and i dont even need powder after i wear it and the coverage is awesome!😄
YALL I WANNA ASK IF THE CUSHION SCREEN CELL COVER IS FOUNDATION BASED?? (FACESHOP)
hiyour dead by the way
more videos with you in it and with talking get ready or something
🌸🌙 Love you mishh!!!!
It's sad to know how unhappy she was when she was filming this 😞. Hope you've found the happiness you were looking for ♥️
Well done, what a video! what a review! Thumbs up!
I love how Michelle is using different people and cares about different people's skin type 😭😭
what I really love about michelle is she's so informative and very soft spoken. i love all her videos..
I love how diverse these videos are
So happy to see you doing a makeup video! Especially in a way that features diversity for different viewers
realy love youre hair, i think make you elegant and wise ...
Someone did her research ;) Awesome video Michelle!
What is your color for the loreal cushion compact Michelle
I don't get the hype... basically its a sponge and liquid make up... it seems unhygienic too, because bacteria will stay in it.
W T F!!!
Michelle Phan is love. 💙❤️
ur so beautiful michelle

I'm here as per recommendation from molita Lin
I missed the old Michelle that doing make up tutorials and dont deny it michelle changes a lot....I miss you
Love your hair
Lol all the western brands trying to copy Korean cushions. Nice try.
So bummed you didn't mention the AmorePacific CC Cushion Compact in the video! it's amazing!!!
Seriously, a guy?
What about for sensitive skin?
What beautiful humans!
2:09 agh those brows cut me
POC, not just girls and going for all the skin types? Very impressed! Well done.
Michelle's hair is ❤️😍💕
2 questions?
Should I use powder with these?
do they have SPF?
how to find emty jar
a little behind but sure
Its will be all germs in spong
i love u
i need to try this out!
Michelle, I love how diverse your videos are. 💋
Vicmram has no pores. dam
Shade selection is terrible for compacts. I've ever seen a cushion that's dark enough for me, and I'm only tan :/
I'm in awe of this video. And the diversity! 😍
this video is so cute :)
Any tips and any brands you recommend for skin with atopic eczema? I have extremely dry skin that dries out immediately (even when coming in contact with water) but my skin looks oily a lot of times because I have to use special crèmes to fight the dryness. I have to apply them a few times a day (and having to mess up my make up...) because otherwise my skin starts to flake. Or my skin is extremely dry, or it is extremely oily-looking...
Thank you. this video is really helpful. im trying to figure out which cushion works for me, since most lines do not a carry a wide range of shades.
🌸🌙
🌸🌙
I miss you so much Mich!!! We know that you're busy we understand huhuhu but we really miss the old videos!! You were actually the first beauty youtuber i watched and inspired to do my own youtube channel!! I love you so much xoxo I miss you so much!! :(
Tianne Phan is a property agent , is she a you tuber? Sounds irrelevant to your beauty career??? I am confused
Anyone else noticed Michelle's undereye area something was wrong..😕😕
This video was so cute!
why does the thumbnail look like that
where I cab get this compacts?
I wanna be Michelle Phan when I grow up. ive wanted to since I was 9
the diversity is these kind of video is just lovely
Michelle Phan Very Same To Angelababy
OMG ILYSM MISH!
who is here because of swoozie
can we al take a moment for this guys brows...  i love them omg
Then why don't sell it at em cosmetics
can we like applaud the diversity here in skin type, age, size, everything. love.
Hearing her saliva when she's talking is so annoying now that I've noticed it😅
Acne skin type without acne
What are "harsher ingredients"?
isn't the air perfection cc cushion she mentioned at 2:36 by the brand Pür not Hera?
i can't find a foundation or anything to save my life. i have pigmentation issues which makes me having to resprt to mixing foundation with white clown foundation..
this is you! ♡ Mish
My grandma really likes your makeup videos, but she says it's difficult for older skin to put on makeup, could you make a tutorial for older skin. 😊
I'm so happy she did a section for different skin tones
i should try cushion compacts that are BB or CC based because those have the same coverage as foundation+concealer and quite lightweight i've heard and i never tried them before.
hi Michelle! i just wanted to say that you are an such and inspiring and empowered woman who empowers so many people. i respect how you try to be diverse in your videos. more power to you!
I wish Michelle would start making makeup tutorials
I put my favorite bb cream in an empty cushion compact i got of ebay. Works like a charm and makes it more convenient to take with you!
2:30 those eyebrows though! <3
I have so fair skin that if I take a picture with someone else, you can't see my face at all. 😂
Love it! I am a big fan of Cushion Compacts! The only thing that ticks me out is the whole sponge situation. I have the Physician's Formula Cushion Compact and would love it if it had extra sponge refills available! I definitely want to try the L'oreal Cushion Compact since I've heard good things.
I love Michelle but when she talks she smacks and it annoys me so much
I love the diversity of guests that she brings on the videos. It shows that make up is for everybody, regardless their age, gender or skin tone. 
The brands should follow her  cause even in Brazil that most people have darker skin, it's hard to find products that matches the variety of colours, which brings the wrong conception that makeup is just for a delimited group.
I loooove the diversity in this video 😍
Michelle, I love your new videos and the diversity, but i really prefer you as the main person
I am teaching In Seoul Korea and I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get darker shades for the compact cushions? Im a filipino with fairly tanned skin, and all brands I've tried here in Korea are just too light. Please help!
someone tell me Michelle Phan snapchat please 😞
what is a good compact for middle school girls... my little girl wants to use makeup but idk what to buy
I love the diversity in people I see here :)
Yaaaaas for the dark skin girls! That girl was beautiful. Unfortunately yes, cosmetics company's have limited shades for us when compared to the various options lighter skin tones have. But like Michelle said we just have to look harder cuz there are a few out there. Hopefully in the future we will get better representation/shade range
Thanks Michelle! 💞
Sofina has this primavista ange
Ohhhhh my god. Don't suggest "milk of magnesia" or say "something like"! It is so bad for your skin!
nice hair color ^_^
the diversity in this video is amazinggggg
I'm not really into makeup that much. But for some reason I'm always drawn to Michelle Phan's video lmfao.
god i love all the models in this video!
I thought using cushions will make your skin have more acne
ayeay, new vids! mish, my skin always have a prob with sunscreen, it'll kinda like allergy but not really. can you make the next ep of mastering the art of sunscreen?
OMG the girl that was after the guy is soooo pretty
Does it run out of foundation quickly???
i love her hair!!
hi mich, you're the first you tuber I always watch and followed , everyone right now is doing what you started . I just wished you upload more tutorials and women empowering stuff here on you tube . more power! we love you !
Wow. The guy is so beautiful.
l challenge you mivhelle to do no brush makeup challenge
OMGOSH I MISS YOU SO MUCH 😢😢😢
I am happy to see Michelle again in her new video. Miss her appearance. It;s been so long she did not appear in her video.
I miss the old Michelle phan. :/
how often does the applicator  need to be cleaned?
we're there not any brands mentioned that don't test on animals?
LOVED the vid :)
Lmao the girl with "acne" so u call that acne?
Can you make DIY Father's Day video? I know you don't have one:( Buy other people do:) but u don't have to!
WHY DO THEY LOOK SO SCARED? 3:33 lol
Waiting for your comeback, Queen..
They all look fabulous without make up:)
I love the diversity!

오
I might be wrong but at 2:34 isn't the air perfection cc compact a Pür product? Not a Hera product?
Anyone knows a vegan and cruelty free cushion? I've been searching for so long...
우리나라가 언급되니까 기분 조음ㅎㅎ
I miss
Michelle please do more makeup tutorials and videos likes this that explain how to use different makeup products.
What about the Missha BB compact? What skin type is that best for?

I have combination oily skin, so I moisturise, then put a thin layer of Milk of Magnesia on my T Zone. When it has dried completely I pop on L'oreal Lumi primer to illuminate my skin, then L'oreal Lumi Cushion foundation, setting it all with some translucent powder. I always feel glowing and slightly dewy looking without actually being oily. This is my fave summer combo at the moment 😍 xxx
amazing
aime si tu te sent con parce que tes français 😂
great vid xx
I love love loooooooove this!
Makeup is for everyone :)
...it feels like every BIG youtuber is becoming more serious...like for example,  Bethany Mota...and even you...But i still admire you
The boys lashes tho 😩😩
Im really new to this cushion thing but if i have a cc cream cushion can i add foundation on top? The shade i got was darker than my skintone ><''
Really detail:) !!!!! :) Like it so much
how would purple combat dullness? I'm just wondering
Is loreal cruelty free
hitting the korean market !
I like how you bring up how hard it is for lighter skinned people to find color matches but completely dismissed how the makeup industry consistently excludes people with darker skin
i like the amount of different people :)
Very nice how u included different genders and nationalities😊
You're the Oprah of YouTube
I miss Michelle ❤️
What color is your hair?? I <3 IT
I want his eyelashes
Can you use a foundation brush to apply bb cream from a cushion compact or should you only apply with the pad it comes with? Thx :)
Guys don't use milk of magnesia as primer!!! It's absolutely awful for it and cause acne and severe damage to your poor face...
Kms where I live in drugstores i haven't seen a single cushion...
chinguen a su puta madre todas jajajaja
Is she still together with dom
That guys eyebrows are fire !:)
She's so prettyy
When are you going to make another makeup tutorial
What is cushion compact??
한국제품 소개라니 ㅠㅠ
What about for those who sweat easily on the face? Is there a type for that?
2:16 I can’t concentrate his eyebrows are too perfect ✊😔
This guy is so handsome
Why is shade range limited? That is not fair for all races..
I hate it  when people say we look like ghosts :(
The sound of michelles voice in addition with the music  in the background makes me feel like im at a spa learning about beauty rather than just on my laptap on YouTube lol
thank you for the info. especially on your choices on dark skin cushions and how to apply it
I'd love to see a "mastering the art of..." video for makeup brushes! It might be a long video but it would be helpful. Different types of brushes can be confusing to beginners (and even people like me who have been doing makeup for many years now!) I'd love to see your brush recommendations, too.
for your next Mastering The Art Of, could you do contouring? Especially with fair "ghost white" skin. I always seem to under do it because I'm to afraid I'll over do it. What tips/advise could you give me to help me with this problem? thanks🤗
Is it recommended to pump more of your fav foundation/bb/cc cream into the sponge after the OG product runs out?
Somehow I can never use a cushion sponge because it accentuates my enlarge pores T.T I tried dab the sponge both lightly and heavily, the result is still the same and my pores look considerably larger compare to using brushes or beauty blender. So cushions is a no-no for me even though they are very convenient.
Love it
what happened to dom??
I can't stop staring at your hair. It's so pretty, it's like black and blue and purple and pink - soooooo pretty.
🌙🌸!!!
Any recommendations for sensitive skin?
What's dullness?
Wow, kudos on the diversity in this video. The dark skinned girl gave me, life not everyone shows them love beauty brand wise. Lol, if you ever need a model with panda eyes in NYC hit me up!!
I am using HERA UV mist cushion in Korea >_< It's so good ~~~ Thank u for this video Your voice is so beautiful ~~~
thank you for this video i was like she is kidding since she deleted it
the powder is setting or finishing?
am I the only one using my etude house cushion atm?? haha
Michelle, make your way to Singapore soon!! Host a meet/greet here, want to see you in person soo bad:)
Hi Michele, I followed exact the guidelines in this tutorial. To my disappointment, I also tried to use mattifying products to reduce oily or shiny effect on my t n u zones. However, it appears too shiny and oily. I even resorted to sponges to apply a natural layer on my face but I failed to achieve the desired result. How sad! I have been around in this field for 5 yrs now. I want to covered redness n melasma spots after needling procedures and at the same time get the natural effect on my face but they all failed to do it.
My face is very pale, and I can't find the perfect shade. What can I do?
I personally use mochi bb cushion klairs x merry between. It’s my skin tone and everything it’s very even to
her voice is so nice
her voice is so nice
Michelle Phan is so beautiful and I hope she is accomplishing her goals also happiness! She is the makeup guru or artist that I grew up watching and seeing her succeed makes me Happy
finally someone that could actually explain the cushioning factor in details!! thank you Michelle phan!!
When your 'fair' model isn't even fair .. lol
Michelle pham can u do another come to work with me please like this comment if you would like to see that
I want to start using cushion compacts
u should try April skin and Missha
I was wondering why you were using boscia white charcoal spray to "hydrate" the cushion and as moisture....then notice you used the same product as a mattifying product...
tbh , ill cut to the chase . your new videos are great but we all really just want makeup looks . ive been watching you for years & honestly the old michelle was better . yeah , you give us makeup looks here & there but theres not as much effort at all . now if you'll excuse me , im gonna go watch your old videos . love you tho
im so happy you put all the skin tones and types 😣 the only people that i see cater to black people are black people thank you
feels good to have a beauty gourou talk to all genders, ages and ethnicity! good job michelle
i want to marry michelle. like she is an amazing person.
))
YASS DIVERSITY! ❤️💛💚💙💜
I just came back to hear that good luck at the end of the video and maybe try to be myself before this world messed me up. Thanks for the tweenhood memories Michelle.
I don't think I'll be using cushion compacts any time soon, but this did pop up on my recommended & was curious about this trending foundation. I have to say, I love the diversity in your video! age, gender, color & skin types. So refreshing!
I hate how Michelle tries to have a 'soothing', 'professional' voice in her voice over
I just came back from Korea and cushion compacts are a must (didn't buy any though since I already have some foundation and BB cream to finish). I loved the diversity in your video, wether it was in body types, gender or age!
Lmaooo who tf are these people??? And why isnt there any Michelle phan in a michelle phan video?? im not here for this tbh.. you dont even make any make up tutorials anymore. It's sad
Is she still with Don?
her new videos are so so so aesthetic goals. a little sad that they aren't focused on her anymore though:(
I really love this type of video but i miss the old ones too! I wish she did both
Where has she been
Michelle i love the woman you have grown to be. Ive been watching you since you first started youtube and my have you grown. I only wish you the best and pray that god takes you to great places in life. ♡♡
I don't like the videos you been posting lately. I miss when you actually did the videos yourself, not have other people in them. The reason I used to watch was because of you
I remember watching this video and thinking that I missed the older style of her videos that were less high-production. But now...I miss even this. I loved you so much, Michelle, and I will continue to! I hope that whatever you're doing right now is bringing true happiness to your mind and soul. I wish you the best in life. You made such a heavy and lasting impact on me from a young age when I first watched your videos. I will NEVER forget how this channel helped me grow in my love for makeup, beauty, self-care, and wellness. Much love xx - Mika
Is somebody here good with make up ? ^^
I'm searching for a cushion but they are so many~
I'm searching for a cushion that don't has a lot of coverage but wears longer.
I also gave fair skin. Fairer than the girl she introduced for. Can somebody recommend some cushions ? ^^
i miss u
michelle you should do a foundation recommendations video!! I wanna splurge but can't make up my mind
How about missha cushion?
Is she never doing Makeup tutorials anymore? :(
I miss you Michelle 😔😔😔
love this video Michelle
where r u phannnnnn i need u
so when are you going to post normal videos instead of these unnecessary ones lol
I love thizzzzzssss
❤❤❤❤❤
Does anyone know of any cushions that are cruelty free? Because I have been looking and so far haven't found one.
well i am from webtoon anyone??
hi michelle. I love all your videos and how you inspiring the girls out there. here I have a request. can you do makeup by using Victoria Jackson product since the concept is 'no makeup' makeup. thank you. love from malaysia :)
does Michelle Phan have her own make up company?
omg this black guy has the skin of a GOD
How are Americans supposed to buy and test Korean products?!
Maybe cause Michelle is busy or whatever that she doesn't appear in her videos as frequent as she was .. However, videos that are professionally edited with beautiful women and diverse skin tones , etc..  doesn't neglect the idea that they need to be done based mainly on the interaction of Michelle with her fans not only with backup voices but also by showing up ( like she used to do in tutorials , pillowtalks , ... her old videos you know !! ) and being a simple beautiful youtuber , and that's why people subscribed to her in the first place and made her what she is today ... i myself miss the old videos :) ! <3
where did u get those cushions?
What about sensitive skin?
Her voice is so soothing
I was a fan of Michelle when she was making her first videos. I loved the progress she has made but recently I feel her videos seem neglected. Please Michelle go make more makeup tutorials. We barely see your beautiful face anymore.
Her nose wth
I hope you will have new videos about makeup tutorials of music stars from around the world
do the make up of harley quinn
Wait what?!!! She looks like JING in METEOR GARDEN 2018 like wtf is It her or what?!!!
Man i love whoever editted this video! Its so fun to watch, i wish i had their editing skills
a love your vid,s their super cool
South Korea is the best
that flipping the cushion sponge was the best tip for reals.
My fav Michelle Phan video of all time
Their skin looks darker in this vid , it makes me confused
Her eyes are sad 😕
Want to watch Michelle's make up.. No interest in trend videos...
Looking back at her why i left video, she just sounds like a different her
why is her voice so soothing to me
You and I were born on the same day
Please come back
Ive been searching for "the foundation" that works on me but everything i ever tried never looks good on me , ive been in the hunt for years :( and under eye concealers look awful on me no matter how expensive or popular
Dear Mish, I really like using cushion because it's pretty easy for a daily use. But after few minutes my skin got all bumpy and I got a lot of sebum going on in the center area of my face . Do you have any tips of what kind of cushion should I use? I used to wear the face shop oil control cushion
I feel like Michelle Phan has become the Buzzfeed of makeup lol.
AWESOME publication! I'm a dude using AmorePacific 208 CC Compact for covering up my acne scarring until they get fixed but WOW amazing knowledge you're throwing out Michelle! The black guy definetly shocked me. Dudes eyebrows are on FLEEK and his skin is amazing. I'm praying my skin turns out as awesome as his after laser treatment.
TheFaceShop's cushions are terrible!!!
Nlighten????
1:24 Kim Kardashian saw it here first
Cool
Hey Mish, with summer coming up, I think it'd be beneficial to have a video about tanning. All the way from tanning in the sun (and answer the question if whether or not sunscreen will block out out the chances of having a tan), tanning spray, beds, etc. I think its important to know the "healthy" way to tan. Because for me, I want to have a tan and minimize my chances of all the damages. Thanks Mish! Xox
pretty
Reading through some comments I see how selfish human beings is. As I know Michelle Phan has been on YouTube nearly 10 years and the truth is that she couldn't live just based on YouTube, she needs to live her real life, have her real jobs. YouTuber is just dream job for young people but look at her, she's in her 30s and her view of thinking is changed differently than us. So I think as long as she keeps uploading new videos, just watch them, she's still better than Bethany, who doesn't post for quite long time. That means Michelle take really good care of her subbies, just with another view of life.
😒
Bokef
Thats why i love Michelle Phan... Always teaching something with amazing edited videos and showing no difference of gender, age, sexuality...
would you change the dialogue like instead of saying fair skin, change to something less bias?
How's the Misha compact bb cream?
South Korea is the best
Where can you get the color correcting ones?.
Miss youuuu sm
i keep watching on the old videos. they are my starting of watching makeup tutorial. michelle's video is the first one i ever watched
Love this 😍👍👍👍👍👍
Love the diversity, wt if you have combination skin ?
Hii guys 
1)Do y'all hv any recommendations foundation that can last for the whole day?  I hv super oily + sensitive skin + pimple prone face (due to hormones) + black head... 
2) I am new to makeup for my skin type do I even need moisturizer,  serum, cleaner, toner etc? If I need which type shld I use tho... 

Normally my makeup will " melt " becuz of the heat in Singapore...
I miss Mish:(
difficult to use
but how is this better than liquid or powder foundation? seems like application would take forever.
Could you use foundation drops to darken the color of an already there cushion foundation?
I miss her :(
I must've watched a dozen videos on the Cushion Compact, and it would have been nice if I knew that they don't work on "Pitted Acne Scars". Wasted $41 dollars today on a cushion just to see my scars stand out instead of blend in :( So anyone who has pitted acne scars DO NOT BUY A CUSHION COMPACT. Alas another beauty product thats not made for us.
One of the first YouTube make tutorial that I watched nd learned from, was yours. It was 6 to 7 years ago I think. Your videos are so wonderful and I really do hope that you would make a come back despite of whatever you went through. let that be a minor set back and restart and continue what you've been doing. do make a comeback. love and kisses from Nepal
Is the boy gay?
I like you
i like that she hired a male model, males can wear make-up too!
my fav think about Michelle's videos are that they are informative! she gives so much info, but since her voice is soothing, its not boring! she doesn't just tell you about it, she helps you!
awesome video! love the diversity
The cushion applicator isn't antibacterial. the cushion compact itself is antibacterial, it is advisable to wash the applicator once every 3 days. However, I realize the applicator gets damaged easily after using it for 2 weeks with regular washing, so i would  get extra applicators to be my backup. however, i realize daily usage of cushion compacts will be used up so quickly (one per month). So I am going back to my liquid foundations.
cutie
Okay how do I stop my skin and foundation from drying out on my skin :(
On your next trend report you should definitely do Pokemon go. Everyone is playing it.
great video
Có Ai Việt nam Ở đây Hk tl commen đi:))♡♡♡ LOVE VIETNAM!☆
Me encanta que en sus videos haya tanta diversidad😍
Why doesn't she make more videos?
I am one with the fair skin
When is ch.13 16 for Helios femina come out?
HIS LASHES. ARE. BOMB.
Ugh this is so confusing for me. I have oily skin, but my face gets dried out in certain areas.. I made sure to not use a lot of powder but my current foundation doesnt pair well with my primer. But I dont have any money at all to buy really anything. Its super dissapointing when youre acne prone as well so you have to always pay attention to your skin, yet since you've got no cash, you're stuck in what I call "skin purgatory" lmao.
Holy moly everyone has amaaaaazing skin! 👌🏻
Milk of Magnesia ruins your skins ph level so only use it on special occasions.
Michelle is still queen and will always be queen!
can you use your fingers to apply
I like the video very much, but... Without makeup, stop lying, the first one had eyebrows filled in so obvious
my friend thought you were promise phan and i started laughing cause you and promise did a twin makeup thing lol
Unfortunately it's not that easy as it looks. The only factor that should matter while choosing cushion compact should be the ingredients. Too bad most of these cushions have either bad alcohols in them,  too much perfume or other irritating ingredients. The only safe cushion I know of  is the IOPE one which I personaly use or the L'oreal one should be OK as well.
She looks like a sim in the thumbnail
the black girl beautiful af
I feel there exists a great way to learn more about beauty tips. Go to google and search: "Blast4beauty". Here you can find very simple tips which is very easy for you to implement.
Cool!
I sooo miss her VOICE!    Hi Michelle it's been a long time!    I mean five months haha   I'm glad I'm on this side of YT again.
Good job!
Stop telling her how and what to do with her videos.
Is biaqua a good brand ? For cushion compact
did she break up with her boyfriend?
Amazing video! Thank you very much!
Come back
anyone that's the same shade as the brown girl tried cushions before? i want to get one but I'm scared I'll end up choosing one that's too light for me :((
What is the name of the melody at the end pls help :(
Thanks for including such diversity! Gave me extra excitement when I saw a guy featured!
Wow😍 that guy is beautiful!
love the representation!!! thank you!
Love the HERA UV Mist Cushion in ultra moisture!
It's perfect for dehydrated skin during the winter :)
I've been really loving the IOPE one lately, I also really love using a dampened disposable sponge to apply it to my face, instead of using the pad that comes with it. It gives me a super natural and dewy finish, also a bit more hygienic 😊
I keep getting excited when she uploads a new video because I think it's going to be an actual makeup tutorial. I miss her old videos :(
I'm currently studying abroad in Japan and my acne got so bad here (I have cystic acne and medication for it) the day I landed here.... but I've seen so many cushion compacts here and wanna try them out, so thank you for this video! :)
finally a makeup video!!
MICHELLE I miss your old videos where I look at YOU doing YOUR makeup and being creative with other looks every week or so.. I miss you.. but I love you..
South koreas amazing with their make up
innisfree's long lasting cushion and laneige's bb cushion (pore control) is best!!
I love how she included men and woman in this video 😊😊😊
they all have makeup on tho
Such a useful video!!!!
i miss mish in her videos this past few months!! so happy im able to see her face again
I definitely consider myself quite pale and definitely paler than the model used in this video. I still want to know the point of cushion foundations and how it is better than applying any foundation with a sponge. I'm not at all trying to be rude, just curious.
I love the video! but i was wondering if you can recomend me one for Rosacea or really sensitive skin, I watched the green one that you recomended, but I would like to know if another options are applicable for my case.
These people are aliens. LOOK AT THEM. Have you ever seen such smooth skin in your life!?
Is she still with her boyfriend? :)
If that girl is as pale as a ghost then what am I...
I love seeing accurate, equal and genuine representation when it comes to skin tones and skin types! Beautiful models and beautiful video!
Very informative! OMG thank you michelle <3
Very helpful... and your hair looks GORGEOUS, Michelle!!
Well done for showcasing diversity! Love it!
I f you watch an older interview of her, you'd know why she doesn't show her face as much. She told the interviewer she'd like to be more behind-the-scenes than on camera. I literally think she just gets on camera to please her audience. Lol
How about mastering the art of makeup brushes! Love you Michele, big fan over here ❤️
I haaaatttttteeeeeeee how difficult my skin tone is. 😠😠 it's not medium but it's not dark. It's like a light to medium dark and I either have to buy two different foundation colors and mix them, or just forgo makeup all together. Which I do lately because it's easier than all the extra steps to apply something that was supposed to be fun. 
Glad to see all kinds of skin types and tones in this video though!!! Love it!! 💕💕
Tbhucernchdh (speechless I dunno why)
Thank you for the information  mish! Love your hair so much😍😍 | mish i heard that bb cushion cannot be used for everyday? Cause it can close your pores is it right?
do makeup videos i miss them
I miss your old video
A lot of people here are saying they miss the old Michelle. I have to say I don't. It's been a long minute since I've checked out her channel and I'm loving this new enlightened Michelle. 
She's obviously grown personally and professionally and that's good news for us. The videos are more diverse, useful, unique and zen! Her voice and manner calm me in the few minutes I'm watching. I love that.
I love Michelle she is so beautiful and kind
Ahhh
Hi, michelle! you so cute!!

have you ever considered going cruelty free Mish?
What 286 unlikes!!!!!! This is not fair!😤😤😤😤😡😡😡😡👿👿
Hera cousen is very good
Please do more of this type of videos, they're really helpful !! love u
I miss your old videos :( these ones are really professional and creative etc but Idk I just miss you infront of the camera!
You always do a good job Michelle!
2:27 hIS SKIN IS SO FLAWLESS omg
As someone with dry skin, for the Innisfree Ampoule Intense Cushion, I wouldn't recommend putting moisturizer underneath, unless you're using something light, like an aloe vera gel. Why? Because I find it starts to feel oily really fast. It also emphasizes dry patches.
Everyone is so gorgeous in this vid!!!
laneige is so bad for combo skin for me... catches onto dry patches so easily and accentuates them
Your make up looks amazing and flawless!! Do you have a tutorial video for this makeup look???
appreciate the diversity and representation!
Sulwasoo is really good!
I miss ur videos like this, more!
Love love LOVE all the diversity in your videos!
Love you Michelle!
what color is Crystal's hair?
do I need to wash my applicator sponge?
good job
What about normal skin? My skin has no problems, so I have no idea which compact to use.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Which brand has the color correcting shades¡?¡?
I still don't get the point of cushion compacts.. can someone explain why i would want one? heh
I LOVE these videos you're doing!!! Thank you for including literally all types of people ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I miss your MAKE UP tutorials :/
I love that you featured a man! So much diversity in your videos 💕
Boycott of Loreal!
Against Animal Testing!
the way this whole video was put together gives me lifeeee
lol finally a helpful video from Michelle Phan, I feel like it's been too long since a good video
Thank you Michelle! I've been wondering about these compacts for awhile, now that I'm armed with info, I am  definitely going to try them out.
You're so beautiful
YASSSSSSSSSS MICHELLE
michelle ur hair is so pretty :)
Michelle's videos are so aesthetically pleasing
My favorite is the Laneige one it's not too white
wait I thought sulhwasoo is for those on the dry end not oily skin type. the line is targeted for women in their 30-40s so their skin is naturally drier. I have a compact from them and they give a pretty dewy finish
I NEED IT
I love lancome Miracle cushion. Only downside it doesn't Come w a refill. And it's around $49 w no refill. The refill is sold separately. But I love it either way. A good setting powder for this is RCMA no color powder. If ur oily. And a good primer is MAC time check lotion.
Make contor videos
I heard the YSL cushion is really good for combination to oily skin. Anyone tried it? I'm looking for reviews for me to try and justify the price...
Good advise for those new to this. You have a great voice for videos. I'm going to subscribe! Have a great one!
Omg I love this video! Ive been looking around for a cushion powder but because I have medium to darker skin, its been hard to get a suitable powder. But now I know which brands to look for. Very straight to the point. So happy this video was made with target points cos Google had it all over the place. Thanks @michelle!
wow
Mish we missed your make up tutorials 💔
That guys eyebrows are perfect😻
Michelle, please consider promoting only cruelty free products. Thanks.
I love that she features real people.
yay! even though i miss your makeup tutorials, these videos are so helpful. i've been looking to get a cushion compact.
HIS EYEBROWS😍
I like how informative these videos are and showcasing other people is awesome. I do miss seeing you though Mish!
is the loreal true match cushion one good? Anyone tried it yet?
this pale circlejerk 😒
definitivamente tus vídeos parecería que van a ser sencillos pero SIEMPRE rompes la regla, te admiro por eso :3
We want to see you, I mean the people in your videos they are nice but we want to see you more ❤️💕
please make a mastering the art of foundation feauturing all the types of foundation, how to choose the right shade, what the finishes should look like, how to apply foundation and more
For your make up recommendations can you do make up that doesn't have animal testing usage in it
Mish, I love you :)
yay to a new video! :)
I like this kind of Michelle
so what's the difference beetween bb cream and cushion? which one should I try :|
Goodbye.
I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos when looking at the likes and views they get. She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots
I love your use of young, old, curvy, fair, dark, male and female models. Thumbs up for no discrimination
UGH MICHELLE YOU'RE SO HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!
This video should be called DIVERSITY. I felt automatically included. Congratulations on always evolving successfully! Love you, Michelle!
I love the Loreal cushion foundation, so pretty!!!
@2:05 too distracted by perfect eyebrows 😍
This was so usefull, I've been wanting to buy a cushion compact but really didn't know which was good for me, thanks a lot
This was so usefull, I've been wanting to buy a cushion compact but really didn't know which was good for me, thanks a lot
OMG I AM LIVING FOR UR HAIR!! AAAHH 💕💖
I don't mean to sound rude but I miss Michelle's old videos a lot
I was having a difficult time on what cushion to get. This video was very helpful!!
I've been watching you for so long I wish that you return on what you are doing before with those amazing YouTube makeup videos we all miss you
Has anyone tried the loreal glam cushion bronzer as a foundation? Only drugstore cushion I've seen in the uk that's in a darker shade
Michelle 😍😍😍 Really miss watching your videos!! I learned a lot of makeup basics from you...
I bought the Laneige BB cushion a few months ago as I was really struggling to find a base for my skin tone and type, as I'm very fair with a pinker undertone and combination skin. A friend recommended I try Korean beauty, and I bought the Laneige BB cushion in shade 11 and now I literally could not live without it. It is the best investment I've made in terms of my makeup. The colour matches my skin perfectly, I don't even have to blend when it's on my face, and the finish is just gorgeous, as well as being lightweight on my skin and easy to remove.
this video is very education thank you boo
we only saw you for about 23 seconds out of 5 minutes, in the video😅 not to be rude, but I really loved your videos back then, with just you, not with strangers I don't know😂 I get that you are trying to feature other people, but I subscribed because I enjoyed just watching just you🙊 I also really wished there were more makeup tutorials😌 
So cool to see the diversity in skin colours, types, and - most shockingly - ages! Mature women are so often neglected in videos or blog posts advising which makeup to use.
PALE AS A GHOST...... OU GIRL IMMA BOUT TO FITE U
I guess i miss her
Why did that guy have to pout so much? We get it. You're gay.
Hey Michelle
I feel like the new trends are getting more like the Capital in the Hunger Games 😂😂 I love it though!!
Can we see some makeup tutorials like we used to?❤️
xDDD Anyone else feeling like we are more and more heading towards that futuristic galaxy look that people always thought humans would have in 200 years? :D Like when people in e.g. the 50s tried to imagine what people will look like in the future and they thought we would start looking like aliens. Yep, we're getting there with all the unicorn-rainbow-ombré hair and makeup haha ;D
I want Michelle back :-(
I'm just imaging the stares I would get if I went in public with rainbow brows 😂
I don't get why people are layering on the rainbow highlight so thick? It looks amazing when it's subtle, just a slight hint of a rainbow sheen when your face catches light. But everyone's using it in a way that makes them look like they just got back from a face painting booth at the county fair. Really, might as well be putting eyeshadow on their cheeks...
Trend repeats are great. Really enjoy watching them but I miss seeing you and makeup tutorials
What the heck happened to this channel and to Michelle
When Mish showed her face all the time, you call her "self-absorbed" & "conceited." Now she has women of all shades, sizes and personality, but y'all talking about some "why isn't she in her own videos?"

Bruh, she can't please everyone! She's human 😂 If you don't like the content, don't watch or bitch about what YOU want. Make your own YouTube and create your own shit, maybe?
I think this is Michelle's way of passing on the torch to her subordinates.
SO.... where it´s michelle?
i cant be the only one who thinks some of these "trends" look ridiculous????
I kinda miss your tutorials
DEAR MISH, I'm not trying to say stop making "trend reports" and "pillow talks" and what not, but as a huge fan of this channel, here is my feed back. Over the past year or so I would go to your channel hoping to find a new beauty tip video or so, but all I get are trend reports and pillow talks. I go back to check everytime I go on every few weeks are so and to my surprise, trend reports and pillow talks have TAKEN OVER YOUR CHANNEL. You were my favorite you tuber/ beauty guru. You still are!! JUST PLEASE start making more genuine videos of yourself that would truly inspire us beauty wise. I'm speaking not only for myself but for many others when I say I MISS SEEING YOU ON YOUR CHANNEL. I haven't seen many hate on you for being on your OWN channel, and this is YOUR channel and you can post anything you want, but as a request, PLEASE MAKE MORE BEAUTY TIP/TUTORIAL VIDEOS. (just like how much you post of "reports" or "talks") <3
Can you do other videos besides these trend report and pillow talk? Not interested.
YASSS she showed Mykie (Glam&Gore)!!!!! #zombaes
Remember when Michelle Phan made makeup tutorials? Remember when she was at least visible in the video?
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
Make an tokyo ghoul shirt jacket
I feel like we haven't seen Michelle for ages the videos are too perfect and conscious.
Seems like we'll eventually be doing our hair and makeup similarly to the people in the capital of The Hunger Games
where is Michelle? i miss the old days... it was simple and fun
I want to see mich talking to us through her lense with her beautiful smile, for some reason I don't feel connected to this video 😭
Who else want a summertime makeup tutorial with Michelle in it?!?🙋🏼🙋🏻🙋🏽 I do!
The trends are getting so weird xD
So so cute and your voice I just love it 😍💄
I kinda wish she did more makeup tutorials
sorry Michelle. none of these are in trend (except for the rainbow highlighter, which doesn't make sense).

Try again next time.
I personally don't like the rainbow highlighter, it's too much for me.
I love it! But the lack of Michelle made me cry 😭😭
I LOVE trend reports but I miss your more, like, helpful videos, like tutorials, talks, diy's etc <3
I wanted to see you ☹️
When will you be uploading makeup tutorials 😶
IS THIS MICHELLE?? IM CONFUSED
I personally hate the rainbow highlighter it look tacky and clown like
I miss your makeup tutorials 😢
"Garnet would approve" I SCREAMED
I'm missing her videos lately, it's now like once a month, I hope everything's ok ):
These makeups are getting weirder and weirder... Someday everyone's gonna look like people in the hunger games
FREAKED OUT WHEN SHE MENTIONED GARNET!
So I have not really been a fan of the rainbow highlight until this model right here made it WERK!  Soooo robotically gorgeous!
Love your trend reports! I liked most the rainbow highlight and coloured brows... aaah it feels so futuristic, don't you think?
Mish, I ask you again for a #RinoaHeartilly cosplay please, I'm sure you'll look majestic (sorry to be repetitive). Blessings from Buenos Aires <3
When she mentioned Garnet from Steven Universe i got soooo happyy!!! Fav show!!
They're all sooo beautiful 😩 I love your channel Michelle   btw 😘
Am I the only one that doesn't like the rainbow makeup??😅😅😅
These are nice to look at, but I think if I ever went to school with these kind of things (especially the brows).... so many conversation starters :D "why are your brows purple?" "because I would like to be apart of the Hunger Games fashion"
DO MORE MAKE UP TUTORIALS PLEASE :( <33
What?? The girl in the thumb nail looked like Marzia and i got confused.
where are your tutorials?? So many trend reports and pillow talks
the crazy feminist look is IN lol
The only decent trend in this video to me was the anime shirts.
I thought rainbow grilled cheese started in Japan
i miss your makeup turtorials!
Love this indie look <3
Michelle if you play the new game Overwatch, pleaaase make a makeup tutorial inspired by their diverse and beautiful women. :D 

I figured you might be into the game since you're a bit nerdy.
I understand if you have a hectic life or maybe this is what you want your channel to look like now but I truly miss your old make-up vids and I bet I'm not the only one.. I truly DON'T mean this in a "raging fan" kind of way 'cause in the end we all love you and we want you to be happy so if this is what you want then go ahead but I really miss your old make-up vids.. I truly loved watching those vids and I hate that you're not part of my weekly rutine anymore:(  hugs❤️
dang how can that girl pull off the rainbow highlight I AM INLOVE 😍👅💦
bruh i was gonna purchase the sunglasses thinkin they were gonna b like $70 bucks tops...they're $500... y'all....
Michelle, remember how you did a summer goals video last year? You should totally do another one because it was my favorite video you made! Love you Mish!!!
Why isn't she in her own videos
I loooove the videos you've been doing lately and I'm so happy you have been able to branch out and try new things with your channel! Such an inspiration <3
I miss you ,michelle
when you will come back? cannot wait to see you in your next videos
Im missing the old Makeup Tutorials Videos by Michelle Phan, yhey drive me to another World ans now Im like... WTF is that???
Michelle....don't you think the make up is going to extreme... rainbow blush and coloured brows !!!!  really ??
I love trend report videos, but this time it felt empty... Dont get me wrong, I love Michelle and her video since the beginning of her time on youtube!! But lately her videos are a little empty, and not as enthusiastic as they used to be :(
Obsessed with the metallic lips gahhh! <3
Why am I watching this, I can't even do a winged eyeliner
I went to the page of helios femina but it doesn't show the instructions.
Forget Unicorn, I want to be a majestic Potato in an open field.

Or better yet.................. A Unitato (Half Unicorn Half Potato)
Where is Machelle in the video ??
I want more machelle at video please I dont want to see those girls in HER video .
does anyone know the font she uses on the title? it's so beautiful 💜💜
Love Steven Universe too!!! ☄✨😎🤗

Anyone Else Loving the Rainbow highlighter?!
I've been waiting forever for this
Cant wait for MP to get Diamond Play button
IM DONE WITH HIGHLIGHTERS!! First rainbow then galaxy now there IS PIZZA!
I love how she said "see you in the next video" ......Yeah okay sure.
Every time i expect to see Michelle on the screen but its always someone else
Next trend: How to get a blue skin tone :D
Google Cardboard headsets were interesting. Wonder if the VR will pick up or fizzle out.
I really dig those third eye sunglasses 😍
I WANT TO WATCH MICHELLE NOT ANOTHER GIRL
These trends are all aesthetic pictures for photoshoots. Yes they may be trendy on social medias like tumblr and Instagram but they aren't what's "trendy" when walk out in public..
I love the color trend going on😍makes us humans more magical
the colour brows im pretty sure are to match the coloured hair but ok
I'm fed up with people who's like "yaaay unicorn is life" or "i'm such a lonely potato"
Come on guys..stop doing same as everyone 
But over than that I like the video
I want those third eye sunglasses 500$ tho :(
Anyone know a cheaper alternative? :)
How come michelle only does trend reports and pillow talk these days? 😢
Ok I know she's busy, but can we have back some good old makeup tutorial here and there? Like please! I live for those!
do you watch Steven universe?(I love the glasses😍)
I probably wouldn't hear any of this
i always love your trend reports! good job❣
Michelle have been wearing that third eye sunglasses since the past couple of years
I'd have HMN ALNS design for HUNTER X HUNTER
Hey! Michelle please upload your make-up toturial please🙏😊💖
i love the rainbow highlightt ~
Garnet would totally wear those glasses, square mom swag✨✨✨✨✨✨
COME THRU RAINBOW HIGHLIGHT. I need that in my life!!😍😍😍
everything in this report is for teen girls.
Dream Look: Fairy Tail, Sailor Moon Crystal
Hmm I am super interested in the whole rainbow highlight look just because I love how unique it looks! That whole metallic lip is giving me major life! I am excited to see more brands make them!
I've been waiting for a video for soo long!!! I'm so happy!! love this
Most people wear coloured brows so their eyebrows match their hair, it looks odd if they don't match your hair.
Please make a video of you and Dom
Mishhh I miss you!! Good luck with whatever you're doing, and I can't wait for the next video❤ ily
Where are the make up tutorials? The last one was in january. I miss them :(
I miss you Michelle, why have you forgotten us?
i miss michelle make up tutorial. so dissapointed.
Yess Anime fashion 😍 I'd love a tee of Death  Note or Ajin!
ayyyy I want more makeup tutorials😌 I am not hating, but I liked them better😊
Finally I can be a Unicorn
Are we living in the Hunger Games now? 😂🙈 these trends...what in the world?
Should I really use rainbow highlighter - and draw purple ombré eyebrows?
.. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
The rainbow highlighter would look better if it was more subtle.
love this highlight :D i see many people using it overseas but can't find it in japan... 7-8 months waiting time on etsy is true!?...
OMG garnet, anime, rainbow shtuff! This episode was awesomeeeeee
The rainbow highlighter! 😍
The rainbow highlighter looked so good on that girl 😍
Who thinks sports jackets is cool??
question, WHY ARE YOU HARDLY IN ANY OF THE VIDEO WHEN ITS YOUR CHANNEL??? What happened to the tutorials and the fun challenge videos?
Thank you for this Michelle! Hoping for more videos from you! 😚
Michelle miss your makeup tutorials
AH I LOVE THESE VIDEOS MICHELLE!
Love,
Maria x
The first girl slayed the rainbow highlighter and rainbow brows!!!! Love her!!!
I loved to see you in the videos. You showed me what a youtuber was and I guess in time, with other work and commitments, you have lost that. I liked your talkthrough and tutorials, specially the ones where you were like Lady Gaga and so. 
The Dom videos were AWESOME, and how you inspired your viewers really made an Impact in my life, where I enjoyed putting on makeup every day and maintaining a healthy routine for my skin. But I don't see that now. I really enjoy your sweet voice and loved the edits you did on your videos. Trying some stuff and recommending others, Specially  if you were/are the YOUTUBE MAKEUP QUEEN!
Maybe is a good thing that now there is a variety of makeup artists, but if you want, there is probably people like me that would love to see a throwback and watch the "old" Michelle once in every other moon. 
It's not a critique, more like a suggestion. 
I still admire you greatly and wish you the best of the best, I just don't think that the youtube channel I subscribed a few years ago is keeping the material that it used to, material I loved and could not wait to see once I got home. 
I loved it so much that I suggested it to all my friends, which I'm not sure I would do now. 
Hope all your dreams come true, and if is not youtube anymore, I understand and support your path. But I guess as a old time viewer, I should say something that was so close to my heart.
Hope you take the time to read this.
Have a nice one
Really fun, colourful looks, wish they suit me tho, I don't mind the rainbow cheese toastie, looks delicious❤️❤️
I kinda miss Michelles makeup tutorials...I hope she will make them soon. But I enjoy these kind of videos too!
STEVEN UNIVERSE
its this kind of video where you share these goodies with us the best videos
Most of the items in this video i have never seen nor do i want to wear them....i miss the old videos...
Can you make a video about what haircuts go with what face shapes, like how you did with the glasses video
Michelle i love your videos but I'm subbed to your channel because I want to see YOU and not other girls:(
You were in the video for about 2 seconds, I thought this was your channel? I don't like seeing all these random people showing products when I subscribed to see you, not just hear you...x
BLESS the web comic is free 😍😫
OMG You  have changed so much!!❤👄
why did the thumbnail look like Alissa Cara?
I really miss your videos. Glad you're back! :D
For HMN ALNS: garnet with 3rd eye glasses and ruby & sapphire standing next to her as if they're taking a picture.
Just my opinion.. I prefer when Michelle sits down face to face and narrates the trend report herself, as opposed to this new format of featuring other people.
What the heck is this????? 🙄
That Steven Universe reference made my day
I've missed you. You've been gone for so long!
💜Always looking forward to your trend reports💙
Please do another tutorial!!!!!!!
Love this series! But I also miss your makeup tutorials 😓
the garnet reference made me cry FINALLY
BLESS the web comic is free 😍😫
how does an open-chain linked bra provide more coverage
Michelle's "S's" are so sharp like whistling
These trends reminded me of Xenon (showing my age here)! I've also seen iron on patches coming back too.
Michelle, I missed your calming voice. I hope you are doing well cause you sound like recovering from a cold. Take care chi Michelle !! Lovely greetings from Germany ❤️🤗
You got lost :( Please keep uploading 😓
Michelle you are so beautiful, and a big inspiration to me it would mean the world to me if you responded! But even if you don't I will always love you. Believe it or not I am a viewer from Alaska! It would make this year if you would talk a little more about skincare. It's my passion and you've taught me to chase my passion no matter what anybody says. My fav video of yours is how to find self confidence. You are such a beautiful human being, inside and out! Keep up the great content! Love from Alaska!😍
Love this video, Michelle! That rainbow highlighter has definitely been trending lately! I definitely want to try it out! Much love!
~Cassie ❤️
SAO, Kill la Kill, Mirai Nikki, Guilty Crown, or RWBY

Michelle i loved this video. I actually thought the length of it was perfect. You were NOT rushing. Very informative; esp since I am going in this business. It's awesome for you to sit down and research trends, and creatively inform us of them, thank you mish ^_~
I love these videos but Michelle I'm missing your makeup videos so please can we have a makeup tutorial next? love you❤

that girl is the only person I've seen that can rock the rainbow highlighter! ❤ I don't like the way it looks on other people but it suited her so much... but then again, she would probably look good in anything cause she's extremely beautiful so... haha
Honestly, I think people are kind of over the rainbow highlighter trend considering how impractical it is :/
MICHELLE I MISS YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE OLD VIDEOS UGH I MISS IT :( I LOVE U MICH ALWAYS.

@michelle phan sorta disappointed with the beauty trend

A soul eater rip jeans and a tee shirt 😊😱👍🏻
ANIME FASHION! <3
The anime that I love is black butler and death note and mew mew power
THE COLORED EYEBROWS CAME FROM AMANDA
I would make a Sailor Moon croptop
We should make it a point to dye our brows weird colors. 

Then claim it's because society no longer has control over beauty standards.
itS NOT HER SMH @YALL
Dude I knew you would get into steven universe it was just a matter of time😂😂😂😂
These videos are amazing!! You really gather all the best stuff and share it so everyone else who is not familiar with trends (like me) can see. Your Trend Report is very interesting to watch and I'm never bored. Keep it up, Michelle!!
P.S. love those three eyed sunglasses, reminds me of Tien Shinhan 😍
Michelle u have at lasstt made a video after a century😂 I love you😍😘💓
xoxo Rabeea
Tbh I've never seen anyone use the rainbow highlight outside of YouTube
No glamgallery this ep?

Steven universe reference!! Yesss!

we missed you so much ❤
I miss the way her channel used to be😭
Please make these more often! I love these 😊😘
I freak when i see these THESE ARE MY FAVORITE VIDEOS AGHHHGAGSAHGSAHSAH
missed u alot much Michelle... I literally miss ur old videos
Anyone subscribed to symphani?
I'd never be able to pull off the rainbow highlighter...but dang is it CUTE!
Random question but have michelle and Dom broken up?
The rainbow grilled sandwich gives me life.
Please make more makeup videos
I don't mind the Trend Reports, however I miss the videos Michelle used to make. I know she has grown and changed over the years, but now, I don't know. Every video is a trend report, pillow talk, or some entirely unrealistic-for-daily-life make tutorial. I don't like what her channel has become. And that makes me sad, because she is my favorite YouTuber of all time. She has been for years. I miss the Michelle I originally subscribed to...
Michelle !!!!
No more videos anymore :((
Please!!!!
THE STEVEN UNIVERSE REFRENCE THOUGH
These are too trendy for me but they're cute. I like the rainbow highlighter!
The rainbow highlight can be worn for Pride so lmao
the original rainbow grilled cheese is from Hong Kong
omg i dont care about the giveaway but your comic is!!! so !!!! fricking awesome!!! i love it so much <3 <3
ohmygod ohmygod you are using music from the Fate/Zero soundtrack on the webtoon site YAAAASSS <3 <3 <3
just started Helios Femina and it's beautiful!! it's such a great mix of galactic imagery and anime style figures. so bright and full of my favorite colors. such an intense opening too... reading on now!
The colored brow is probobly only popular because of Melanie Martinez
I love how colorful these trends are!!! Let's keep trends this way :D
Gurren Lagan 😍😍. Or Heavens Lost property!
they should make a Fooly Cooly shirt!👌
The rainbow grilled cheese actually originated from Kala toast in Hong Kong. please actually do your research.
I miss you so much michelle <3
you should do a video about female hygiene
your videos just bring me peace. 🌙🌚
That highlight tho <3333
Your videos are future. It makes me realize I'm in the future 😃
Missing you WAY too much for 3:50 video.:(
i wish YOU were in the video!! still loved this

Some of these are really pretty, but some just look... ugly.

i really want a tokyo ghoul shirt that would be awsome

(But loved this video as usual mish ;*)
Even though the video was 4 min it felt like 10 min
AHHH THAT STEVEN UNIVERSE REFERENCE
That Mykie spotlight though!!
I wasn't feeling the rainbow grill cheese
Loving those anime shirts :D
This is a REALLY AWESOME Playlist! Just wanted you to know that your 
#TrendReport videos are not just for women! I love the Anime and the TV Shows 
you throw in. Please KEEP THIS GOING! Much love. Just subbed! Also, Let 
me know if you would love a graphic designer for upcoming projects!
Wtf,,,,that's not even trendy
Watching the rainbow cheese while starving because of Ramadan was a bad idea.
Kaichouwa maid Sama, aka me ha kill, special a oh damn.. There's much more anime a like diaboliks lovers and vampire knight
i missed you lots Michelle!
this is so cute and aesthetically pleasing i love it :0
Absolutely love your trend reports! Can't wait to see ur next vid! <3

who are still watching and miss this girl ...
Finally I've waited for another video for ages how long does it take I missed you so much 😫😫😫😭
srry to ask are you still dating Dominic
Plz post more I miss you and your vids!!!!
I KNEW IT. I started matching my eyebrow colour with my dyed hair and ppl thougt that it's weird but HERE WE ARE :D
wtf did I just watch?
Dear Mish, I really miss the make up tutorials. 
I love you <3
That rainbow highlight is everything! I need it in my collection right now <3
miss ur tutorials so much.got to know a lot from u,where r u?😍😍😍
Is this some kind of joke? 😂
where I live If we wear a rainbow highlight and coloured eyebrows you would be looked as a crazy person lol but I would sure love to try them all
I want them to design kaneki ken! Tokyo ghoul!
I missed you :(
Loved the DBZ shirt but then went  to the website and saw the price and wanted to cry lol
Rainbow Highlight, Colored Brows... only a question...WHY?!?!?!?!
This all so futuristic 😅
For the anime tees: ATTACK ON TITAN! :D
And maybe Dramatical Murder, Kuroshitsuji, and Haikyuu! Haha
It's called trend report but I don't think that what is portrayed in this videos is covering the current trends at all. The trends described by Michelle are always futuristic, a lot of neon and bright colours, but in reality this is very much niche. Yes it's trendy amongst some people but I think it would be fair to include the other 90% of what is trending in these videos too. Or the videos should be renamed to something more appropriate.
I think Michelle and her PR team are making a mistake with the direction that her channel is taking. She has proven before that she can make great video content but she is veering off the right path. It seems that she and her company think that there is this unexplored market out there of young girls that want to watch what she makes now and buy her products, but I think this change in style is a bad decision in the long run.
Also, I think the mentoring she is trying to provide to young girls through this carefully selected and seemingly diverse group of (minority) girls she shows on screen is not working because the viewers have no bond with the faces they see on screen.
Sorry for the long comment!
I LOVEEE these trend reports oh my gosh please keep them coming 😍😍
Geeze sorry but I thought this video was poor. A lot of the trends have been trends for ages and you're only just picking up on them? Also how come you're never in your videos anymore, just a voice over. Feels so lazy, Michelle if you don't want to do YT anymore then don't.
I don't know how I feel about that rainbow highlight... XD
more trend reports please... i love them..❤💙💜
I miss your makeup tutorials michelle! 😘 you are the first person who taught me how to use makeup.
I'm sorry but yawn.. Please do more makeup tutorials. We miss them... Thank you.
Always her endings are so....they give me goosebumps and allow me to pursue something because the music gives me feels
I'm obsessed with Helios remina please do second part
these trend report videos are so relaxing. ^0^
Great video and great content as always. I know, you're a very busy person, but I really miss your face and your makeup tutorials. I know that I can watch any of your old stuff, but your tutorials are always so amazingly put together, that it's just a pleasure to watch. And I really miss seeing you doing it. If just once in a while you (when you've got time) put them out, I and many other fans would be very happy and would appreciate it! Love you! Keep up great work! ❤
Que triste, casi 9 millones de suscriptores y ya pasaron 7 horas y no tienes ni 100 mil vistas :(
but everything is so expensive
i want that highlight so much omgg
Loving these trend reports! Keep it up! 🦄💎💜
missing your tutorial
oh come on this is ridiculous
only an handful of style seasons away from becoming The Capitol from the Hunger Games
miss you Michelle ! i love you!!😻😍😍
That highlighter thooooooo <3
I love the rainbow highlighter it's sooooo pretty
Favourite type of videos ahhh
Hmnalns' tees are so badass, but they are very expensive tho. $95/tee. I wish they would design either cowboy bebop or samurai champloo.
STEVEN UNIVERSE OMG
I miss the old style of Michelle phan video🙄💜 ...but the new videos hell awesome 😍❤️
more of this :)
girls wanna look like clowns because?
I would totally like a shirt with any kinda bad ass sailor moon :3
THESE ARE MY FAVORITE VIDEOS FROM U
Actually, the update on YouTube lets you do the cardboard effect!
Sorry but this rainbow highlight is terrible.
michelle, where have you been? what's going on? we miss you
where would you wear funky brows??? besides a festival lol
Woah I haven't watched her videos in ages she looks so different o.O
my dream outfir would be lyrics t-shirt
In the past days i used to love your videos. but nowadays your channel looks like news channel. Attracts none. and you're losing viewers. Sorry to say but I want That Michelle Phan channel back.
What is the brand of the highlighter???
Ok , we like Trend Reports , but lately you are uploading so much of these.Please do another type of video . Love you Michelle 😙
loved the video! still my fav channel ever! x
Mishy, I want to see you in the vid. Please make more makeup tutorials! All of your vids are amazing!
this video was boring...
The only trend I like is the rainbow highlighter....but not THAT harsh 😂
"trend report" just gets shorter and shorter....😢 i mean 3 minutes...seriously
Welcome
Back
YAY HAPPY DAY! Im graduating tomorrow and Michelle put up a video :) I love you. You're so gorgeous, inside and out and intelligent. I love your attitude and motives. Keep on rocking.
MICHELLE PHAN IS GOALS
Yay,  I love trend reports!!
One piece💀
Does anyone know what song is played at the ending/closing of the video? It's so beautiful <3
When one of the iPads is already won by someone because the original giveaway deadline was three days ago. /facepalm
Helios Femina is so good, too! Keep it comig! ;D
I love  these kind of videos♡♡ Thank you♡
michelle i miss youuu... please make another makeup tutorial. i love your work! it's magical.

ooh damn she's an occ girl, willam would be proud
I make 10 sec vids pushing random objects...
And a butt
Keep this comment at an even number of likes
I'm very in love with your trend reports 😭
+ Michelle Phan you should do a beauty busters series
you know, I wouldn't mind a lady kiriunin shirt.
Who else thought this was deleted 😱😂💗I'm so happy I found it, but it's a bit weird it isn't in the main video section✨
Awn, honey, just now you're realizing about the rainbow highlighter as a trend? That was weeks ago!
miss the makeup tutorial😭
YOU ACTUALY PAID 500 DOLLARS FOR THOSE GLASSES??
An outfit based on  naruto would be my life
please do a summer makeup video! i would love it if it was kind or related to your PSYCHEDELIC DREAMS video! thank you
people complain on how boring Michelle is when she does this colorful childish videos! It doesn't matter because this is who Michelle is truly is deep down! at least she doesn't pretend to be like someone else! you can watch other famous youtubers who have basically the same videos! same edits same quality and its getting boring! we need people to express their own self and ideas and this is what Mish is doing! if you don't like don't watch it, just skip it because we definitely need no negativity on social media
YesYes, Square Mom would love the third-eye sunglasses.
garnet would aprove 👍😂
I'd love to see a makeup tutorial again
I LOVE trend report and I find it incredibly creative. But we miss seeing you, beautiful! You'll always be my favourite youtuber but I'd like to see more you. You are the reason I started watching this amazing channel about 7 years ago and never stopped. <3
Yay Michelle I love u so much
So basically the trend right now is to be a unicorn
anyone mind linking the give away? cant find it
Michelle we all miss your makeup videos😥
I miss Michelle doing makeup tutorials. grrrrrrr
She hardly uploads videos now...
I miss Michelle Phan`s videos
me encanta mish <3
Now I can eat, wear and live the gay. :D
Princess Jellyfish!!!

Absolutely love these trend reports! And your outros are the best ones I've seen on Youtube so far ♥

I really miss your makeup tutorials
Your voice is so Inspiring and effective.
STEVEN UNIVERSEEEE

OMG rainbow grilled cheese?! I need to try that! Also love the pom pom sandals. So cute! xx
Garnet Approves 👍👍
Tokyo ghoul shirt
can't wait to wear that rainbow highlight to pride
The beauty community is lost without you! Please come back and upload :( WE MISS YOU
hey mish, would love to see a video that isn't a trend report or a pillow talk, preferably a makeup vid, love you x
i miss the old makeup videos but this ones are cool though
It's been 4 months since a makeup tutorial
I dont know about the rainbow highlight I think its too much tbh lol
love these trend reports!!!! they give me awesome ideas of how to rock a new style!!!!
Omg Michelle is a Steven U fan!
I MISS YOUR OLD VIDEOS ..COMEBACK ...NOT JUST ONLY YOUR VOICE ....THANKS♥
Sailor moon ofc!
For a HMN ALN shirt maybe some Sailor Moon, Bleach, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, honestly so many options
Garnet Would Wear it herself xD
I'd give a fortune for a Dedective Conan t-shirt!! that'd be so effin cool!
What kind of program do you use to edit video???? It s fantastic
wow ppl barely watch ur vids anymore altho theyre more well-made than be4 wtf
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a video on spinbrushes. i seen many reveiws and a bunch of products,but  i don't know who to trust so im hoping you could do a,video on it. please! love you! ♡
sailor ☾
whrre's gram galary?
I would like a t-shirt with alot of bugs on it (xD)blue and green dragonflies, mantis and maybe fireflies, they fit the atmosphere, but their colours are odd
Mish your helios femina comic is amazing! I always can't wait for the next chapter :3
The rainbow highlight is a bit too much imo
You know when it comes to anime merchandise I feel like Blood+ isn't appreciated at all. In my opinion it's a really good anime and it would be very cool to see some Blood+ shirts 😆
the colored brows could only pulled off with colored hair... if u have natural hair color you'd look a bit crazy
I REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT GARNET WHEN YOU WORE THE THIRD EYE SUNGLASSES IN YOUR ZODIAC VID <3 <3
did anyone else think of Melanie Martinez when she mentioned the colored brows??
I REALLY love these Trend Report videos. They help me spice up my look/ wardrobe
gahhhhhhh! I've been waiting for new trend report vids! Love you mish!
So glad that you have a new video up. I miss your videos!!
2:36 XD LOL
I APPROVE OF GARNET MAKING A CAMEO
;( i want to see Michelle doing some kind of tutorial like it used to be 😪
I am still not into the rainbow highlight or colored brows yet☹️
I miss Michelle 😂
I've missed your trend report videos Michelle! <3
I saw garnet coming lol
I've been watching your videos for years and I just wanted to say I admire all the hard work you put in your videos. You inspired me so much over the years! Just wanted to say thank you Mish!😘
I love your trend report series! They're always so relevant and handy ^_^
When you've been doing coloured brows since August 2015🎉🎉
I miss the good ole, just plan makeup tutorials!!!!!!!!
Wow, 500 dollar sunglasses! Dx
The third eye shades are really cool but are there any alternatives which are more affordable than those from the description? (500$ !!)
i miss u doing makeup but still love u
Missing the old Michelle :(
rainbow highlight?? purple brows?? interesting trends going on over here.... I am not brave enough to try them but I take off my hat for those who are:)
Missing your tutorials...
not a fun of the rainbow highlighter.
pro tip: apply the lightest color first,in the center of your lips and then line them with the dark lipstick,that way you won't stain the applicator sponge thingy
☁️🌿youtube friends anyone??🌿☁️
im new to youtube 👽🤘🏼
Michelle can you do a makeup tutorial
NARUTO!!!
I wish she would post more makeup tutorials. WE MISS THE OLD MICHELLE!!!
It would be amazing if Mish did the ROAST YOURSELF CHALLENGE!!!
Where is the glazed donut trend :P ?
I have been watching Michelle since 2010 I miss the old Michelle doing tutorials..
" By everyone see you in the next video" .... But we didnt even see you in this one :(
How to become tacky, by MP. I'm sure it was not Michelle who had these bad ideas.
literally none of this looks good.
i would love to see an attack on Titian shirt 😁
when are you going to do more makeup looks?
I love your webtoon michelle!! Its awesome
ATTACK ON TITAN
THESE TREND REPORT VIDEOS ARE AWESOME!! KEEP IT UP!!! xx
Who thought of Melanie with the coloured brows?
Awesome trends! Especially the brows!
This video! 💛
I think colored brows only work if your hair is the same color lol
I don't really understand the giveaway terms! Can someone explain please??😔😔
clearly no one is reading that comic lol.
Phanally a new video!
For the next video can you do a summer make up look
Omg I would make them design korosensei pastel clouds on a periwinkle base colored T !!
i miss the old you michelle :(
I thought rainbow grilled cheese was started in Hong Kong :|
uh uh honey, that rainbow highlight is ours why do straight ppl gotta take everything
I thought that vans are also really trendy now😕
ya video! For a second I was like wait does Michelle do videos anymore?
MJ shirt for realz!!!
Did she just mention Mykie?!?! Yay!
I really miss your makeup tutorials, I really don't enjoy your latest videos.

I watch this just because her voice is so soothing ;o;
I have been missing your videos. 😘
i missed u
Hey Michelle I really miss your makeup tutorials and mishdom a lot
I wish Mish's vids would last for hours. 
I love her videos sooo much from her voice, her editing, her filming and content,... ahhh I just cant get enough of them 😭 😭
none of these things are in except rainbow highlight
I miss your own makeup look tutorials.. I miss you..
Rainbow Highlight just cool af!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! luv it:*
I think if youre only going to feature other girls you should start a new channel called FAWN or whatever. Kinda dissapointing when youre not even in your own video. Your subscribers are here for you, not strangers.
My favorite youtube seriees eveer(:
This was a s t h e t i c
MICHELLE..why arent you posting weekly anymore? we miss you 😭😭😭😭 like if you agree
Nope...
Cheese is nasty en todo el sentido de la palabra
SSSSSSSTEVENNNN
please do make up tutorials more
I miss your face Michelle but as always love your trend report. I didn't know rainbow grilled cheese is now a thing :D xoxo
I would want them to make an anime shirt from Naruto or Another.
AM IN LOVE W THE RAINBOW HIGHLIGHTER 💞 but totally grossed out by the rainbow sandwich yuck! tho i honestly think half of these are pretty old trends?
What are screen caps?
I would love a sailor moon design on a shirt.
On my anime shirt I would put Ours High School Host Club or Black Butler.
make a make up video
Do u use a laptop to edit
hey michellee ♡♡♡
I really miss your tutorials with you in them...the videos now feel so empty...sorry:/
I miss MishDom videos 😩😩
I love trend report but I hope I can see more makeup video instead of this update. :(
😍😍😍👏😭
The Hunger Games is coming true.
Miss your vids 😢
I can't be the only one who's in love with Michelle's voice
Okay I don't think so but can you buy rainbow highlighter at Sephora or somewhere like that? Or can you only buy it online?
you should be in your own videos
how come u used differant people instead of u
Dream outfit:black body con dress with mini backpack , adiddas sneakers and baseball cap
I miss your makeup tutorials 😢 however I do realize how busy you are with other things and how it can be hard to think of all these different looks, so I just hope that you are happy and successful ❤️ can't wait to see more exciting things from you!
where I find this virtual cardboard
I missed you so much Michelle!! I love these trend report series, they're so cool!!
We all love you💕
I love the trend report videos! There's always something cool and interesting.
Io ti amo
Michelle should do ASMR
Can u make another makeup tutorial?
those sunnies are $500, no thank you
Can you do a Helios femina makeup tutorial please??? Loved the video btw ❤️💛💚💙💜
michelle, I used to love your videos, but now it feels like you're trying too hard. The trend reports you do are months after the trend's time. please go back to makeup videos.
Causal Sailor moon tee
MICHELLE PLZ COME BACK TO THE NORMAL ROUTINE..I'LL LOVE TO SEE UR TUTORIALS AGAIN <3
love all the trend reports!!!!
Rainbow high light!!!!Yus. Yus.  defo rocking them this weekend 😄😃😚😍
The outfit she was wearing together with the pompom sandals was so cute!
Yay! Another video! Love you!
I love Michelle but she like hasn't done a makeup vide in like 6 months that's what she got famous in I'm dying without one!
ENOUGH with the trend reports!! I miss the make up tutorials and Michelle!
I love this series so much
There is a reason why Michelle has so many subscribers: connection. She always made me feel connected watching her makeup tutorials and of course her sit down advice/talk videos. Now it just feels like each of her videos are just sponsored and very commercial like. I wonder what made her decide to go down this route...I felt like she found more of herself years ago until now.
I miss her makeup videos 😪
$500 sunglasses is a trend?????
I'm suprised on 2:42
i think if Michelle decided to stop uploading those Trend Reports i'd quit watching YoutTube! THEY ARE THE BEST
thats a lot of cheeeeeeese
where has she gone:( she never posts😭
i don't like any of these 😂😂😂
Zombie Vegeta <3 <3 <3 <3
Why so short but amazing video as always
Michelle why aren't you vegan:((
tokyo ghoul
Okay when Princess Peach said "Sweet!" I got really excited
I miss her makeup tutorials 😇😕
this is so cool
I wanna be in Michelle Phan videos 😩💗
I just wonder if there's anyone who will wear the rainbow highlighter out.......
Make a new makeup tutorial
More make up video please

michelle phan, u are beauty inspiration, u incourage woman that they can be more beautyful. but what are this?
you made woman over make up i mean too colorful that they will be look clown.
so disapoonted. many of ur fans waited for you, and yes u download ur videos but its all about trend etc pillow talk, it is nice also but how many times? we miss make up tutorial where u started, i hope u dont forget where u start, if u r busy or something problem pls just make a short video about what happen? or for sometime u cannot upload make up tutorial, 
you just waste our time search8ng and waited on you.
sory i say this cause i am one of ur fan waited on your make up tutorials that made me inspire.
GARNEEEEEEEEEEET
make a Haneki shirt
Please make more makeup tutorial Michelle:(
I miss her tutorial with her on screen not this random people..
I love trend reports, if I'm being quite honest
i don't get this it's doesn't seem realistic to me those make ups is not even wearable. I miss the old michelle phan videos those simple tutorials yet helpful once 😞
What happened to her doing makeup tutorials
No gram gallery?
I love metallic lips
I really really miss the old Michelle channel :(
Michelle's outro's give me life
2:07 who thaught of doritos girl when saw her😂😂😂
try to unfollow her, and am sure she will take care of us again.
Please do more trend report! I love it a lot.
Rainbow cheese!??
why you abandone us?? and after all this time give us this weird vídeo :(
please do more makeup tutorials
it feel she is a bit gone.
i understand, she has full up.
but what if she made makeup tutorials of her day. like she go up on the morning and if she going to a more special thing she could record it. 
Just an idea....
Do you watch Steven univirse cause I luv that show
Human Aliens might have this but I'd defentitly want them to make a Cowboy BeBop shirt
I would have Gray and Juvia from fairy tail hand in hand doing a unison raid
Yass Michelle's back!!!!
This was SO beautiful I my eyes exploded with rainbows
garnet would approve
Metallic lipsticks? The 90s are back.
lol u look so different!
Lmao remember when she ACTUALLY made makeup videos??
hi dear i really missed u & ur useful video .happy to see u again love u
well that was quick
Michelle it's almost Halloween and I just realized how much I miss your Halloween makeup videos they're so beautiful and creative. It brightens up my day. I hope you make more this year.
I love this series to freaking much!!!! I looovveeee all the rainbows
please credit the creators of the rainbow hilighter!!! especially since so many people are copying it now it's sad that the people who invented it don't get the proper credit!
@glamandgore
I'd ask HUMANALIS if they can make a sailor moon tee
the rainbow grilled cheese looked so unappetizing to me for some reason... As for the anime tees... Love it! A really cool sailor moon tee? Yes! :)
purple lip color?? need
Human Aliens should do a Tokyo Ghoul, Pokemon or Helios Femina collection
Do a makeup tutorial
Wish i had the courage to wear colored brows!
i only loved the anime tee
The Hunger Games is here... we're literally the Capital haha
I like the rainbow highlighter but I'm way too afraid to wear it! It looks gorgeous though :)
I hope you make a makeup territorial for the next video and you be in the video just you it's better
but the question is, who is actually going to try this?
Some of these trends are very out of my comfort zone.  But I will be sure to give them a go, why not? You never know when you will find your new favorite thing.
I'm a big fan of Michelle but I don't understand why she doesn't post makeup videos like she used to 😩
Why doesn't she upload videos that often anymore?
ive always wanted gold eyebrows
OMG MYKIE
THE GLASSES ARE 500 BUCKS
I don't think any of these are new..?
could you do some makeup tutorials again?
I had just checked your channel yesterday just to see if you had posted anything new and I missed it. Good to see you back!
Pokemon shirt would be cool to me haha
Some one plz answer this but what font was at the end. Like the one saying good luck. Plzzz tell me
Michelle I love u so much !!
Can't find the info for the giveaway anywhere on the heliosfemina page.
yayy garnet
I just love the music at the end of her videos, it's so soothing.
I miss tutorials and make up tips :(
I miss you michelle
Michael have you heard of WindPouch? I've been seeing hem everywhere online. Pretty cool new invention
i know a very inexpensive highlighter and its called oil and grease lol
her voice is so soothing I love it
curious, did you mean the giveaway ends on July 1st? cause it says June 1st but this was posted on the 8th .____.
these trend reports are getting cooler and cooler :) ! I love how fashions getting so colourful
Make a charmander from Pokemon shirt or a digit on shirt ..that would be cool
r u a fulltime catoonist now?

i feel like the coloured brows are over
And no good luck ?🙁
I miss the old Michelle  :/
I love your videos so much!!
those sunglasses are amazing . Bye bishes drops mic
Can you please do more trend reports
Rainbow cheese? What???? It doesn't look edible.
2:44 SCREAMS
i love you sm
Happy Hunger Games (sheesh these trends are LOUD in the color department)
This trend should be titled as COLOR BOMB! way too much colours everywhere :/
I would definitely want to see HMN ALNS design more athletic/japan wear... If ya get my vibe..?
I want to create my own anime character or put myself as an anime character.
I SAW MYKIE AND FREAKED OUT.
I don't know if Michelle takes any requests anymore but it'd be really cool to see her do a makeup tutorial based off Naruto. Like Naruto's Sage Mode or something like that. :D
Oh God. I can see the hunger  games coming...
MAKEUP. TUTORIAL. PLEASE
Why aren't you in the video... Hmm
Those eyebrows are a no-no
i love these trendreports

The only trend that I liked was the Grilled Cheese one.
i miss Michelle...
When I worked cosmetics my hair was hot pink, so I used to fill in my brows with hot pink too. That was 8 years ago!
Can't wait to see someone with rainbow highlight in the street... LOL !
the makeup looks were soooooooooooooooo messy
Rainbow food colored cheese and rainbow blush highlights ?? Lol no...just no
I WANT SNK OR TG OR HETALIA FROM HMN ALNS
I really miss michelle she was the one who got me into makeup
i like how our trend has become more and more colorful xD
I miss your face so much
who's garnet?
I love Michelle's voice so much
I would have that company make a Free shirt lol my obsession
She inserted a picture of Mykie for the colored brows. Zombaes!
Please mish make more make up tutorials , I love your trend reports but please please do make up tutorial and it's so sad how you don't really most often 😢
is it just me or does her camera make weird sounds?😭
Welcome to Panem
I really miss her old videos :"(
Mish, can you do the eyes makeup tutorial that it can go with both red and nude lip colors? I'm graduating and I need that look for my big day! Thanks❤
YAYYY TREND REPORT!!
I guess Im the only one diggin the rainbow hghlight lol...
Finally another trend report! My favorite videos to watch on youtube <3 Nice to have you back after some time!!
ehh....🌈 blush...looks weird esp on her maybe it might look good on someone else? idk..
any else just want regular makeup tutorials from Michelle?
You haven't done a makeup tutorial in 4 months
vietnamese
Guys lets get Michelle Phan to 9 million subscribers! :)
Guys lets get Michelle Phan to 9 million subscribers! :)
why is everyone so obsessed with wanting to be an unicorn?? can't wait for that whole unicorn trend to be over and done with!
horraaay!!
The apps are awesome
I loved the third eye glasses but they were 500 dollars!
I normally color my eyebrows so that really doesn't seem like a trend to me . 😂
Can you show us how to make a rainbow highlighter if you know how to do it?
I would have them make an attack on Titan shirt
i was missing her videos so much :(
I felt a lil bit dissapointed because it wasn't michelle reporting it :( but the rainbow highlighters was SOOOOO COOL!
I love trend report so much 💜
New trend report pls mish!! Miss you
Another great video, Mish! <3
I personally think the rainbow highlight is overdoing it its just too much
THOSE SUNGLASSES ARE 500 DOLLARS AHHH
VEGETA'S FACE IS GONE HAHAHAHAHAH
where's Dom?
I love the trend reports you do!
Idk why I'm subscribed anymore. I love her makeup tutorials but she hasn't done one in four months.
where's michelle....?
Am I the only one who hates the rainbow highlighter?  😖😷
Love these trend reports!!!
I love these videos Michelle!
tbh i miss your 'makeup tutorial' videos. i do love your 'trend report' videos but pls bring back the 'makeup tutorial' videos. i badly miss it.
I would like them to make a Noragami shirt
Am I crazy to think that the rainbow highlight might actually work out and look good ? :D
I loved the eyebrows!!!!
OMFG WHEN MICHELLE MENTIONED GARNET I ACTUALLY DIED
only 90's kids will remember michelle phan in michelle phan videos
😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘💄
AaaaaAAAAH IS THAT NATASHA AND MEGHAL?!
well the hunger games was right about us
I'm totally fine with her not making as much makeup tutorial videos as she was before because I'm never going to use much of the makeup looks unless it was a casual look
0:07 AHAHAHAHAHHA ME WHEN I GET FED
Are you ever going to post a make-up tutorial again? :( Bc I miss watching those a lot
se are Watling fore the next trend report
Unpopular opinion. Im tired of the rainbow and galaxy trend :/
It'd be cool if human aliens made one punch man and psychopass themed shirts.
J imagine que tu dois avoir beaucoup de travaille mais ca serait bien de faire une vidéo avec toi dedans
A fairy tail shirt
Y'all should remember these aren't the only trends that are huge right now in the makeup//fashion place. It just seems that Michelle tends to lean towards the more " bright " and " colorful " trends.
garnet~
Is nobody going to mention that those sunglasses are like $500? Like omg they look dope but why would you pay that much for sunglasses?! :O
Yaaaaaas!
Looks like Shirin David
HMN ALNS PLEASE MAKE A SAILOR MOON LINE OF CLOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the trend reports! Your style is so futuristic and different that most of the things people are used to seeing and it's entertaining
I miss you mish! soooo muucchh!! 😍😍
I want to get purple and blue or silver highlights or rainbow streaks, but I'm on the dance team and we must have "natural colors". I mean silver kind of is natural because when you grow old your hair that color but idk. We're getting a new coach so maybe she'll let us dye our hair other colors. One of my friends who's on the dance team too just dyed their hair pink, but she said she was gonna keep it just for the summer. 😭😭😭😭 I really wanna dye my hair something unique and fun. grrrr
Been walking around with colored brows and metallic lipstick and bold coloured eyeshadow for a while now and now it's becoming a trend. But people here all dress the same so i don't expect others to wear it, which is a good thing since i'll be staying my own unique self ^^
I've been waiting for your tutorials like ages. Though Trend Report and Pillow Talk are quite good, but I believe most subscribers would love to see more of your tutorials. I always get inspired by your makeup too. Really hope you see this comment, Mish.
i like the longer trend reports where you're there talking to us, and i also loveee your season favourites like summer or back to school favourites lool i just wanna see your face
Am I the only onw who felt this video was rushed?
terrible trends this time!😱
Nooo Michelle!! I wanna see more of you :( even though i really enjoy watching these trend reports and pillow talks, i miss seeing ur makeup looks :(
i feel like I'm the only one who genuinely loved the rainbow highlight trend lmao
shortest trend report so far
gurl that lipstick... no
I thought the video icon was a joke
i enjoy watching these, not because i care whats trendy and will be looking to try them out, rather too see these crazy trends!  I find them very interesting.
I would have hmn alns make a helios femina tshirt! I like your anime on webtoons :)
U go guuuuurl!
Omg michelle I love you 🦄⚘😘💋
nice third eye concept
Hmm ...some of these trends are like for the year 2200's 🚀 😸
amazing
I didn't know colored brows are trendy now, guess I won't feel as weird now
I know people are really loving the coloured brow thing, but I feel like it's the trend we're gonna look back on it in 10 years or so and face palm.
love this video! !
Michelle I love your videos, but I miss the beauty tutorials. I used to love it when you would do really cool transformations into Barbie or show us an eyeshadow tutorial. I miss the old Michelle
Fan girls  <3 !!
I'm really not dighig this rainbow highlight and eyebrows. who would wear this in public???
So short this time:/
I love this videoooo
!!!! the rainbow grilled cheese trend started in Hong kong, not SF.
were is michell face 😢
i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee trend reports
Does anyone know where to find the giveaway link? I went to the website and couldn't find any info or link. 🤔
Love your trend reports!
Finally a new video!
make a erased hoodie
When are you gonna do another makeup tutorial? It's been 4 months since your last one :'(
I love these !
I like these! They are funky! But sweetie, you haven't uploaded a makeup video in like four months; and not everyone likes crazy (rainbow) stuff or sporty fashion (letterman jacket)
Beautiful
I thought u will be trying it out??
I feel as though you have lost your touch with these videos. It doesn't feel as real or like a report. I miss you sitting at the desk
I'm happy that Michelle is now a super successful woman but I think she should sometimes post something on her YouTube channel. After all it was one of the many things that helped her. Anyways I love you Michelle.
Is dat michelle? I am back after a long tym and cant recognize her. Whats going on?
Pleaaaaaaaaase do more makeup tutorials
I really loved this video
Who wish that she could upload a video everyday!!!
where are u michelle?
I miss her earliest videos...
No more beauty videos?
I miss these trend reports.
I would love if you did a haul
wait why isn't it michelle in the video??
video it iss :*
she never does makeup anymore :(
Mish I've been watching your live subscriber count recently and you're losing  subscribers because you aren't the one filming your videos. All of us miss your makeup tutorials. You've inspired so many Youtubers to create a channel of their own with this channel and it breaks my heart to watch this go down hill even if ipsy and em cosmetics is thriving, this is where it all began and it's worth keeping up and putting a lot of effort into. I understand you're busy but you were the first and my favorite Youtuber I ever watched and I know so many other people who feel the same way I do. Please upload a makeup tutorial soon. Congrats of Helios Femina I love it. <3
Wow Michelle changed a lot.
ew... Michelle what did you do to your face?
I dont like the new kind of videos. Watch the videos from the past, years ago, then you know who is Michelle without operations
That's not Michelle....
I personally appreciate the rainbow highlighter sure it's not an everyday thing but it really gives an extra touch when you're going out to a party or a music festival like cochella. I think it looks really beautiful if you wear it paired with the right makeup up, outfit and hair.
garnet  😃😃😃 when ur favs are in 1 video
wait is that Michele the one in the video ?
These trend reports are stunning.
I hated 90% of these trends.
Wth? That is not Michelle phan?
stupid trend reports... where is your normal videos?
I'm so obsessed with these trend reports!!
I hope we don't turn into the Capitol people from hunger games...
GARNET
we all missed makeup videos!!!!!!!!!!!
How to look like a weirdo 101
When is Helios Femina chapter 11 coming out?
more career talk and trend report please! :)
I think most of these are cool. But I'm not all that happy with the chain bra thing.. I mean,  I don't want to see kids my age, (14), or younger wearing stuff like this is in future.
Still promoting unhealthy, cruel, environment-wrecking food I see....
I think my favorite  thing was the third eye sunglasses. I'm a guy and I don'y care about gender standards when it comes to fashion so you can bet I'm gonna rock those.
No more makeup tutorials?
I got the virtual head set cardboard thing for free you don't gotta waste 15$
Remember when Mish used to make film? Oh the days
Michelle I miss your face! huhu I cry.
A EXO tshirt
I'm sorry michelle, I love the human alien shirts, but their insanely expensive and I'm surprised you would feature them in this if most of your subs aren't able to afford them.
Are u really that busy?
I love the trend videos!!
pls do a makeup video :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
Where's Michelle?
First it was galaxy, now rainbow, next monochrome, and so on -.-
that girl reminds me of azaylea
I love you Michelle !!!!!!
wait a minute, this might sound stupid, but I didn't know that Michelle own comic on webtoons
I want the rainbow highlight so bad:( Can't find it anywhere here in Indonesia :(
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do you not do makeup tutorials anymore???
786.jihat
love Michael videos but miss her
Love this video! We are a new channel! Please give us a look
i thought that was cheese on her nose but it was her nose ring lol awks
Nothing I like in this episode trend reports, don't get me wrong I still love her, but this bold style isn't for me 😁
Well love shana even im 11
Loving these trend but I feel something like the rainbow highlighter, metallic lips, and colored brows are all trends for festival makeup. It's a look for choacella or and other festival. I personally am looking forward to the Reading festival in the UK this year and I'm happy to be going. I might test out the rainbow highlighter and metallic lips for that.
Where is the 3rd eye sunglasses? There is no link
Is she Vietnamese ?
And another thing, michelle is simply reporting these trends, not starting them.
i watched this video awhile ago but didn't subscribe back then, thinking it was just another random video made by people who barely know what they're talking about. I just finished watching a music video thats trending so much and in that video, almost all of this stuff was in it. I immediately subscribed. WOW! PSYCHIC.
Rainbow grilled cheese.... what
Where was this when I was an avid raving little weasel?  I used to literally use paint ..so horrible.  I am so glad the 90s are gone.
colored brows are only cute if you have colored hair :(
all the trends are trash
Aww I liked the longer trend reports. So fun to look at everything and almost live vicariously through these videos. So visually appealing too. <3
More trend report
Lol I don't see anyone do these trends in real life
Interesting trends!
I miss trend report :(
Hey Michelle, i really miss your transformation videos. I think you have a talent for doing those videos. I mean... look how many views you got? They are amazing!!!!!
I miss her old videos
I LOVE TREND REPORTS😆😄
Her closing theme song is so relaxing :( it reminds me of The Sims songs :(
A lace up dress!
TUYỆT VỜI QUÁ CHỊ ƠI
Wats the font yuh use ?
I love Michelle and her videos and still I'm sad that in most of her new videos she's just the voice (wich is beautiful), and it's rare that she's acting in front of the camera like in earlier videos.
Anyone else who thinks this?
pretty sure I am never going to put on colorful eyebrows
I love these trend reports!
That girls tongue at 0:09...😳
wow is this the new generation of beauty ?? I'm dissapointed. What happened to all natural and basic makeup??!#&?
our fashion is getting weirder and weirder ....
i miss this kind of video
make a damned beauty video, not these dumb trend reports. Get back to the makeup tutorials and DIYs
Next tend report: GRAFFITI HAIR
I know it's a bit upsetting to some of us to not see mish on YouTube as much. But she's doing what she loves,  which is why her focus is more on creating her comic than on makeup.
The whole lip makeup thing is not smart to me..people spend so much time doing 7 different steps, when it'd look just the same as if you'd swiped it regularly.
GARNET
I thought it was marziapie on the thumbnail haha
I know this might be rude or anything... but I really miss the old Michelle where she posts herself doing makeup or just her talking to us (with her face of course... This videos are great too.. but I miss her :(
Must have... Owari no Seraph...
I don't wear make-up, but I've considered at least trying something out, those rainbow highlights are making me really want to try that out at least once.
SAO
My dad had been working with VR at his job, so I've been messing around with the Google cardboard, the Samsung gear VR, etc. it's awesome
Have you stopped youtube.
Music?
:-)
The applications of the makeup were so sloppy ew...come on Michelle. I miss the old you. I unsuscribed a long time ago. But seeing as you're moving forward and creating a new version of yourself  I can't interrupt that process.
I. NEED. A. BTS. SWEATER.
give me more trend reportssss
give me more trend reportssss
OMG i love these trend report videos
that girl with applying the metallic lips... her makeup was horrific but good to know
Are you going to do other videos apart from trend reports and pillow talk?? It's kinda annoying and boring 😒😕😕
really loved this video! but its such a shame to see how much your channel has changed and grown to a very different, less personal style. i understand all channels change over time but i miss the old and more connected videos personally
wtf?
I'm loving the fact that all the things I loved throughout my life - rainbows, metallics, and the idea of VR immersion are trending! I was always teased for being a nerd - even for using the word "hacks" instead of tips, which you can see everywhere now. Maybe I'd have grown up "cool" if I were born later, haha! So good to have you back Mish :)
Love trend report😍😍😍
Where did you go?
I feel like I never see any of these things as trends and then when Michelle puts her trend videos out, everyone is doing the trends in her videos lol she starts the trends
The rainbow highlight looks like a cheap rainbow tattoo that you peel off on your skin.
Is she serious with this mess?
Do any of you know any good brands that sell natural ingredient makeup? I found out when applying eye makeup, my eyes cannot stop watering
Oh no...videos only once a month! I know that she's busy and YT has opened up a lot of real doors for her, so she's got a real life and not so much of a digital life, and I'm not saying she sold out but it's still sad to see the change. I know ppl don't work this hard to stay the same, but its hard to watch the fall from grace. She'll always be the best but she's def not as around as she used to be. Her or Andreas choice, just gone...
Where can I get those shorts she wore with the anime shirt???  I need them!!
she looks different...
She said a bad word
Im not keen on any of these trends tbh, but fashion is always evolving so give it two months and everyone is probably going to be into something completely different.
So cool! Love these video!
Cute video, but the rainbow grilled cheese made me feel a little queasy.. :L
好多广告
The colored eyebrows only work if your hair is colored, too 😐
You're being weird now michelle
hi
I miss u :( It's pretty sad to say, and I'm not trying to guilt trip anyone, but I miss the actual tutorials. Like, if I wanted to see what was trending, I'd just go on Instagram, not wait about 2 months for a 3 minute vid. I miss everything that used to be on this channel, now, it's just something I forget about. Even if u maybe aren't going to be posting a tutorial soon, can u at least be in ur own video?! :* (
Not trying to hate but I'd love to see some makeup tutorials, I know not everyone will agree with me but it's been a while and I do understand you have a very busy life but especially with summer coming up it would be nice:)
I love the Trend Report videos, but this one felt a little rushed...
I love rainbows who else ???
8 million subscribers
400,000 views
?????
Where can you get the sunglasses?
am I the only person that got a little weirded out by how these looks reminded me of the hunger games?
My old fart days must be kicking in because none of these trends interested me. Why must we get older?
OMG U GUYS MY MOM KNOWS MICHELLE PHAN IRL AND HAS HER NUMBER AND ALL HER CONACT INFO!!!!! I WILL SAY HER # IN THE COMMENTS IF U GUYS REPLY TO THIS COMMENT SAYING U WANT ME 2. 😱😱😱😱😱😂😂😂💅💋💋💋
Would Christine like this?
where can I get that rainbow contour makeup thing?????
Is Michelle in any of her videos now? UNSUBSCRIBE
So is she still with her boyfriend?
Please do more make up tutorials!! we miss those. I am sorry but I am tired of these trend reports and pillow talks. I feel like its not you anymore. As some one who came to know about the make up side of youtube through you, I really wish you could go back to making those amazing make up videos you used to make.
Love that the recent trends are colorful reminds me of Helios femina wherever I go ☺️
YOU, we want you and your old videos. I like these new videos, but I'm subscribed to Michelle Phan to watch Michelle Phan. )-':
I didn't find the rules for the giveaway on the website? Can anyone help me find it?
trend girls look like kylie jenner wanna be to me.. show some unique stuff plz. i don't wanna follow trend stuff
Sometimes her videos keep getting boring . Still love her tho
Anybody else get reminded of Luna Lovegood when colored brows showed up in the video?
YAS GARNET
Colored brows? ...what lol
she should actually make videos with make up that we could wear and not only on halloween
GREAT VIDEO MISH! x
Her voice is so clear and soothing
great video
I LOVE TREND REPORTS!!!
What’s the name of the background music? I tried the description one but it wasn’t the same
The weird colorful fashion things of Hunger Games are coming to life.
I love the colorful makeup but I don't have the confidence or an occasion to wear it. I feel like I am in this awkward stage of feeling I should dress more like an adult but I am not old enough to pull of such a look. Too old for a teenage look (which I usually wear) but I look too young for a more mature look. Am I the only one with this problem?
who else thinks that theses trends are weird and crazy? i dont find them pretty.
Clown make-up
I LOVE YOUR TREND REPORTS!!!!!
I really don't understand these colored-food trends. In today's pro-organic, no GMO, natural-is-better world of food, why are so many people willing to deliberately shove a bunch of food coloring down their throats? Food coloring is in a ton of stuff we eat, but we aren't purposely adding it to those foods ourselves for the sake of a trend. I just don't get it.
Guys lets get Michelle Phan to 9 million subscribers! :)
Guys lets get Michelle Phan to 9 million subscribers! :)
I love trend reports Michelle
Michelle why you stop making makeup videos :(
LOVE YOUR TREND REPORT <3
Where can i get the blue bomber jacket !!!! Anyone know!??
Just here for michelle's voice. I don't really like the trends of 2016.
The girl who wear rainbow highlighter really looks like the girl in Justin Bieber "One Less Lonely Girl" Music Video. (in my opinion...so....)
Michelle we want to see you more in trend report. Just like the old ones. please.
PLEASE DO MORE TREND REPORTS!!!!!!!
This is so stupid. Who came up with it?
I miss her old videos, makeup tutorials and advice videos where the only person on the video was her and it looked like she was the only one who was filming it :( I need more personal videos from her that make me feel like I'm talking to her/she is talking to me face to face.
All I see is Halloween makeup, it looks beautiful but for Halloween. Or costume parties. Sunglasses are corny.
A michelle phan's video without michelle :( i miss her old videos...
terrible. it's like she's gotten too lazy to think of greater things. disappointed.
They look absolutely ridiculous.  I know makeup is self expression, but there are some limitations.
The 3rd eye glasses are the dumbest things ever...
WTF??? Is this serious???
guys don't blame her for all these weird trends she's just showing it to you its not like she made it.
ベジータいて草
That cheese thing looks disgusting xD
I have the google cardboard that I received at youtube space and also have a regular VR might try that app
WAIT A SEC SHE DOES HELIOS? OMG SUBSCRIBES
OK I like rainbows a lot, but not enough to wear it on my face, feet, hair, lips and cheese. Besides good old yellow cheese will forever be the best.
I don't like her new video like this. Miss your old video
I have no longer see her boyfriend in her videos. Did they broke up?
These are all pretty ugly. All the trend reports are, no offense 😅
Come back to YouTube Michelle! We miss you! We really miss and need you. Don't you miss the simplicity of a self made video? I can't stand these anymore. Please come back.
Come back to YouTube Michelle! We miss you! We really miss and need you. Don't you miss the simplicity of a self made video? I can't stand these anymore. Please come back.
A trend report without Mish in it?? Nooooo!!!! 😧
Michelle plz go back to making new of makeup plz i miss watching it
why are these trends all so ugly
plZZZ do a video of secrets on succesful relationship
0:12. XD
I would have hm. Aliens make me whit Jean pompon sandals and a third eye glasse
Where do you get it and my daugther wacth to and she want rainbow grill chesse
I really don't like the HMN ALNS-Stuff..... one half looks unappealing and the other looks slutty..... :(
Am I the only one that doesn't like these new makeup trends?? except for the metallic lipsticks, that's awesome! :)
these trends are for 15s year olds... those color look ridiculous
Which brush did you use to do the colored brows?
Are the athleisure still popular? Because I still like them.
u are getting boring.  -.- makeup tutorials are ur thing, not this.
I don't like this trend, it looks  like a clowns face. sorry don't like it!!
anyone else who thinks this look ugly? i surtenly dont like this look .
Sorry to be rude but...tbh one of them looks like a guy...
I wish she'd go back to doing tutorials :( I hate this trend report stuff
please go back to making tutorials! and maybe monthly favourites.. miss your old videos
Pls do whats on my iphone pls
i love you so much
When will she go back to making actual make up videos. Enough of pushing 1 minute worth of crap and her comics in our faces. She's too busy doing other things and not focusing on what brought her to this level in the first place. I subbed for her AMAZING make up videos and now those are seriously lacking. please make more!
Oil slick colors. Looks nice
I love the Trend Report videos! <3
the vr thing the thing that Google created. when google created it the Google team came to my school and they gave it to us to try it out it is super cool
fantastic
The girl who filled in her brows make them crooked looking and so did the lipstick girl :/
I really love the trend report videos
👎👎👎
Readers please don't troll well in really fat I'm just 10 and I'm 70kg so please guys and Michelle please help to reduce fat
this is so ugly
Hey Michelle!!! You are amazing and you are my first ever favorite make-up artist... My mom told me about you and I always watch your videos since I was 5. I'm now 10! I only commented now on this latest one cuz I figured MAYBE you would notice this and I only created a Google account last month sooooooo.... Yeah! BTW my favorite look of yours is your Alter Ego look. I'm not really gothic in person. I just loooooovvve that kinda style! If I would re-create it some stuff may be similar okay.. Sorry for that, haha. Like the Moon Phase Tattoo (I simply love it seriously!), and the Black Lipstick. So if you read this, thanks!!!!!!!!!
hmm
Interesting
love your trend report videos!
These Trend reports are the only thing that keeps me from literally being an 87 year old grandma that doesn't know what a selfie is
Ehh
i love trend report videos 🙏🏻🙌🏼
Am I the only one that thinks the rainbow grilled cheese looks kind of gross (but I like normal grilled cheese idk)
When is there going to be another trend report??
I loooove the way the highlight looks on her. Metallic lips all the way. Love these, Mich! ♥
I miss the makeup tutorials! Bring them back please
FINALLY!!!!! A new video 😢
I love CoCo and BreezY sunglasses they look amazing!😎 Next level
My biggest dream is to be on Michelle's gram gallery... But i guess my instagram page (jenerbeatrice) will have to wait like... Forever 😩
GODDAMN I AM EAAAAARLY HELLLO
Love you so much Michelle!<3
tokyo ghoul t shirt yaaassss
please, do not only makeup, just like in firsts trend reports
Yes,yes,yessss.
I LOVE HELIOS FEMINA
that was short:/.
weeee miss you micheeeelle
Sorry but that looks incredibly stupid
I love your trend reports!!!!!!! :*
these trends are all ugly unless u pull it off well tbh ??
I miss the times when she was putting the egg whites on her face and speak about omelettes
why Michelle is not in any of her trend report videos anymore like how smosh ( ian and anthony) is not in their own videos as often.
I hate how Michelle isn't even in this video! I really don't like all these other people in your videos, I miss just us, one on one.
For the Google VR headset they are on sale for 5 dollars off so you can get 3 for the price of 2
is it just or me, or was the rainbow highlighter the BEST one!
I'm so earlyyyy
dang. that highlight is art.
Lord have mercy i am thinking about all the anime characters that i ever wwanted Yagami laito , Kaneki ken , almost all diabolik lovers male protagonistes hhh and without forgetten zero and kaname from vampire knight , sebatian and ciel from black butler .........and the list goes on.
omg steven universe omgomgomg
love the video can you do a get ready with me
those sunglasses are $500??? omfg i think i'll pass.
Michelle where are you 😭
no more make up tutorials? :(
the hunger games are closer!
Anyone know where to get rainbow highlighter🌈🌈🌈🌈
YESS
oooooooooo
Maybe i'll try the colored eye brow look. Take a few selfie. And wash off. So that no one will no. 😁😁😅
Why does she post like once a month now???
my dream outfit would be a cute pink summer dress with a beautiful bikini underneath if I were to be going swimming
देवेंद्र कुमावत
Did you stop filming makeup tutorials? In the past few months all you have been doing are pillow/career talks and trend reports. Getting kind of boring tbh
Oh god. Why do u keep making this boring videos? We know about these trends from Instagram. Stop being such a star. Do a make up video. Or smth where u will be visible
Am I the only one who hates almost all of these? ._.  I mean the rainbow highlight is cool.  Other than that...
YAAASSS! Unicorns unite! 🦄💖 Thumbs up if you're secretly a unicorn 😂
IVE BEEN WAITTING FOR THIS!!!
The rainbow highlighter is awesome
i really love the rainbow highlighter but i wouldn't wear it outside
Ooh Michelle i love youuuu. ❤️

YASSS
favourite series on this channel is trend reports!!
I love your trend reports!!!
Wait, this isn't Michelle right?
Nope
👍❤💙💚💛💜☺😊
Google cardboard is too heavy for my head, eyes, nose and everything. I hate multiple colors on face, looking cheap. Not sure if i still like your style any more, I mean, i am no longer 12.
Cute white shirt  with cat whiskers and a crescent moon and black jean shorts with some fading moons and a cat ear headband
Didnt like the lipstick😷
Those sunglasses are so stupid
I love trend report videos

Hii
hiiiiii
Why am I watching mediocre girls not doing makeup that great, when I'm subscribed to Michelle Phan. Like I don't wanna watch others do her videos, and then only listen to her voice. What's that about????? :/
Horrible.
Michelle!! Where are your makeup tutorials?!?!? We need them, I like your trend reports but I prefer you makeup tutorials way more it's been like three months now. Sorry but I miss the old Mish. Unsubscribing for a while sorry :/
I LOVE these kind of videos, they help so much!
I miss her tutorials i feel like her channel is always advices or somethings, I thought she started her channel with makeup looks and now it's like this, and i hate it its so boring, if it's always like thie I'll unsubscribe, so disappointed😡🙄😑
FINALLY RAINBOW HIGHLIGHT!!
Michelle I missed you you're back ❤️
OOH im so early but dont know what to say
I MISS YOUR VIDEO SO MUCH ❤❤❤
i love the highlighter.
12 th ❤.   PS ilysm
love the rainbow highlight!
Aye I'm early!
YAS ❤️🦄
love this
wow!😍
Thank you for the trend report Michelle!!
42sec!
so much love for your videos! :)
firstt
I hope the rainbow highlight will be available in Korea...
The girl who did the metallic lip did it horrible....
I have been subscribed to her channel when she just had little viewers nowadays her videos are so weird I don't think I want to look like A rainbow flying cat in the streets all the time, It's like her videos are getting darker illuminati...like nahh I'm good, ..  I mean what's up with this now. Sorry I had to unsubscribe. It's just not authentic anymore. 
It's cool in an expressive way... Just not connecting to me, or shall I say grasping authenticity to my attention.
I told her about the rainbow highlighter (that she didn't mention it in her last trend report) and now it's here!!! Yayy :D
Make a hentai print T-shirt. I know is VERY vulgar... But I think it would look super cool and a dope street fashion item.
Im so early 😂
Yay! Love the new vid
Rainbowww
Wow, ground braking. I had never heard of rainbow highlighters, except in EVERY YOUTUBE VIDEO posted in the past month. Thank you for the great, new content, do you even care about what you post anymore?
who the hell would put a rainbow on their face!
I mean I guess this is nice if u wanna be a unicorn for Halloween
I love how a lot of people are complaining that she isn't doing as much makeup tutorials, but she's giving VITAL information for you people to succeed when you get older. This is something our schools forget to teach us unless you choose a specific elective class that covers these things. 

Some of the stuff in the video may be common sense to you, but based on how people act at their job LOL they forgot or never learned these essential tips. haha
Stop bitching that she's not doing makeup tutorials. There's thousands of makeup tutorials on YouTube, I recommend Casey Holmes and Jaclyn Hill. I find videos like this super helpful and different. Thanks mish!!
Michelle is the only youtubers who knows whats the most important
I love the different variety of your videos! Regardless of the topic, they are always educational, entertaining and fun to watch! <3
it's so hard to find internships honestly.
So crazy, the first internship video came out as I was preparing for an interview that week, and now I got the internship and I start tomorrow!! Perfect timing, thanks for putting these tips out to us Mish :) xoxo
Thank you for making these kinds of videos, Michelle--makeup tutorials are all well and good, but career and general life advice is important, especially for young people who are trying to get a headstart in the world. There are some unfortunate realities when it comes to life in the workplace, however, and I think it would be interesting to see a video that addresses issues that people face every day when they're at work and how to deal with them--issues such as sexual harassment, dealing with co-workers or managers you don't like, and how to move up in your position. Sometimes it can mean the difference between being able to keep or lose your job/internship, so I would be curious to see a video (or two) that covers things like that. Love you Michelle!
I feel like you're a more modernised TED education with a touch of laid back smooth teenage feeling ❤️❤️❤️
Love your Career Talk, your videos are not only entertaining, but also so useful! Thank you for everything you do 💛
Love it how Michelle cares for her subscribers by encouraging them to be confident and to build their own career. She is a perfect example of Beauty with Brains 💜
Am I the only person obsessed with the pillows???? 😍💖
Perfect timing, great information!
y did she stopped  doing make-up  tutorials
i love all of the career takls, pillow talks and stuff like that but its been 3 months and 11 videos since we have gotten an actual makeup tutorial and believe it or not thats the reason why me (and i bet a lot of others) subscribed to you
That sweater looks amaaaazing on you, Michelle. <3 :D
I miss her beauty tutorials and I love them but I love this more. I love how she went from beauty guru to a lifestyle channel that helps us so so much for our future. I'm sorry but people evolve.
You've not done a makeup tutorial in over 4 months COME ON!!!!!
Michelle why arent you uploading makeup videos anymore?
Person reading this never forget that you are beautiful inside & out, don’t stress too much & smile lots. Have a wonderful week!! 💓
can u start doing some makeup tutorials????pls!
michelle may i know where you got your top from?? please please it looks so fab <3
Good video!
Thank you, Mish :)
6:02 DATS MY BEST FRIEND DAS MY BEST FRIEND
I don't even do make up but I miss Michelle Phan's make up tutorials.
Can we get some makeup tutorials
I need more makeup looks your so good at them I just need more💓💓
Thank you so much for making these kind of videos!
Can we have more makeup tutorials please😫☹️
more makeup tutorials please!!!!! i love ur makeup tutorials because they are different from everyone else's
Love Michelle's top...✌️💖
So how do you keep in touch with them 3 times a year after the internship? You can't just email them and go like hi how's your day going right.... are there any techniques on how to email them and stay in touch?
Been 4 months since last makeup tutorial.
can next time be more on networking and keeping in touch!
Let's talk about resumes,cover letters,and cv. I don't remember if that was on the first episode
Michelle you seem to get happier every video it's very nice
Where did the videos go??? Not just the videos in general, but what about makeup tutorials😪
I love your videos!! ❤️ your amazing! Keep being you, and keep being a dreamer ❤️
Can you do another Day in my life video
Are u planning to do anymore makeup tutorials?
please do a makeup tutorial!!
where are you now Michelle? WE MISS YOU!!! <3
Michelle's long floppy sleeves was probably what I have focused on and been distracted by most of the time while listening to them talk. Her blouse is just SO cute. And away from that, this video totally gives me a sense of preparation when I do get an internship at the hospital. Thank you!
I've never been this early what should I write?? XD
love the advices.isnt the picture a bit grey/?
this was helpful, but i swear to god if i do another unpaid internship im flinging myself off a cliff
Yaaaay
Like it if you are one of first-watchers💛
Thank you for featuring a plus-size clothing model and for giving out such good information!
Where is your videos I'm going crazy! Upload immediately!
I love this! I'm almost done with my first year of college and thinking about doing an internship next year so this is perfect timing. Thanks Mish and Lauren!
Don't take me wrong, I like this videos, but I really miss your makeup videos T.T
Can you please do a hair and makeup tutorial on the look you wore  in the video please? love you❤
Oh my god is that blue plushie Sayo from Touken Ranbu?
Very cool Interview! I absolutely love this! :D
Omg she published this video few days after i applied for an internship at a bank. Wow perfect timing and this was very helpful. I hope my anxiety doesn't ruin this for me
I haven't been subscribed for like a year, today I came back and saw your low views?? what's happening Michelle? listen to your audience girl! Don't become a Ray William Johnson!!
Hey michelle. So my formal is coming up soon and I decided I want to wear false eyelashes for the night. I tried researching the eyelashes, and found all different styles like Tapered end, natural, glamorous, wispy, or lengthen. I was wondering if you could make a video to teach about applying, what companies are the best for natural, what eye looks to include while wearing falsies. I haven't seen many videos, so I hope this gets attention to you! Haven an amazing day thank you!
Can you do an episode on interviews. How to answer questions, dress, and stand out. You talk about  all this once you have the job or internship, but not how to get there. Thank you Michelle. ("⌒∇⌒")
am i the only one who immediately noticed the shelf full of nail polish?
I seriously LOVE your career talk videos! 💖
Mish I love how you have evolved into business woman and building your brand. It can't be all about makeup and fashion and I love how you're helping others.
Love this series. Thank you for sharing not only beauty knowledge with us, but real-world working tips. Love you Mish! ♡
Loving this career talk series! Thank yku so much for making them :)
I miss the old videos when she makes homemade mask and cosplay makeup simple fun health and beauty DIYs I mean I still like her but it's just not the same😐
you are the definition of Beautiful, Mish!
I really like these career talks because i'm coming to that point in my life where I have to decide what I want to do in my life soon!
I really like this series! It's really helpful!! Thank you
You're the best 😁💖💖
Very helpful! 
I've a question: when i need to work with other people in a personal venture or new creative project and create something different.  How encourage these people? 
Love that big knit! 
Thanks a lot, kisses
THIS WAS SO HELPFUL! Thank you for creating such great content!
She has nothing else to do now except talk.
I turned up 2 hours late on my first day but now I work for the place I interned at. You can always redeem yourself if you're one kick ass intern ;)
hey mish! Im a super great fan of yours! 
Love all your videos and you're always my role model 
btw you look tired in the video i hope you're all good, don't be stressed out <3 
Bless <3
MISHDOM Q&A please !!!!
Love these videos! 😃
Didn't Michelle's sweater look like #FinalFantasy 's style? Michelle... I love these videos, but I admit I also miss your cosplays, I'd go crazy for a #FinalFantasy8 cosplay video, I know you'd slay as #RinoaHeartilly
Blessings from Buenos Aires <3

Hi Michelle, can you give some advice on starting my own business in your next pillow talk please. It would help me so much if you could share some tips on getting started. Thanks I look up to you a lot. :)
Omfg please do a makeup tutorial!!!!
+Michelle Phan I know that a lot of people like these vids, but PLEASE MAKE BEAUTY TUTORIALS!!!! I always look at your channel, looking for a makeup tutorial, but when I see these vids, I exit out of your channel 😰😥😭
I'd find it very helpful, if you made a career talk about how to find the perfect job for you!
3 times a year? But what kind of email should I send, what subject?
PLEASE DO ASMR VIDEOS I LOVED THE LAST ONE
Hey Michelle! Have you ever thought of teaching makeup classes? I would join so fast. I really love doing makeup and want to further my skills and knowledge.
this is so helpful. They don't really teach this anywhere. Thank you Michelle !
Having my internship program right around the corner and watching this (feeling more confident than ever)  Thanks Michelle.
really helpful advice ! Thank you so much !
Wow thank you Michelle and the intern queen! I'm definitely going to keep everything you said in mind. You rock!
I really appreciate your hard work, thanks for being such an inspiration. This video is amazing ♡
but how do you stay in touch without being creepy? isn't it weird to mail them 3x a year saying "hey how is everything going?"? xD
This was actually really helpful! thank you both so much Michelle and Loren! I'm looking forward to the next one!

I always watch Michelle when I need advice. She's so helpful.
Very useful thank you! I start my internship next month woo
I love your new style of videos on YouTube but I would like to see more of the makeup tutorials and beauty videos that led me to love your channel🌟
thanks for the awesome tips
PLEASE PLEASE CONTINUE THIS
SERIES. LOVE YOU. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST HELPFUL VIDS EVER. :)
my first internship is in a couple of weeks and i'm absolutely terrified >-<
so I saw your book in Barnes and Noble's and I bought it just staring it was so amazing #please_see
Can you please do The Power of Makeup
Next year, i will graduate so now i'm searching internships. This video is sooooo useful. Thank u so much. I hope  content of next video is about finding a true dream for students in high school and other people. Love you ❤️
for the mail (K.I.T part), what do u say, write..? Tks for the discussions, its great.
I am actually wondering how to keep in long term touch with the guy who offered u his/her biz card? Sometimes I can leave good first impression and get offered a biz card during those networking events, but I just find it hard to keep in touch, like, how do you send out ur further emails after the first follow-up email? I am really at a loss of how to turn those networking results to a real job opportunity.
this series has been super helpful and reassuring...thank you so much!
These videos are so helpful x thanks Michelle!
Love all your tips and advice!💕
Thanks so much for these tips!
Omg the sweater! Michelle where did you get that sweater from, I love it!
Can you please do a makeup collection video? I love your videos
i love these!!! keep them coming mish <3
I really miss your makeup tuotorials Michelle 😪N I'm always waiting for that. 🙄
first!(one of then)
😸
I missed you Michelle <3
Do more ASMR videos there so cool
You probably won`t read any lines of it - more your employees. 
Just a note: I wish - you Michelle - would keep the 100% natural aura that you once had on youtube. Unfortunately I have to admid that the whole impression and expression is too businesslike - too professionel. I see your heart somehow but not your real reflection. Maybe you just look a little tired....but it is my opinion. I`ve been following you on youtube for years now.
I know the one about job resumes and stuff passed but i wanted to know, what do i do if i dont remember the name of my boss/ supervisor from a previous job years ago? Usually they ask you for that information but i dont remember it and dont have a record
Its great to see Michelle having grown to be so successful and having busy-pack schedule but it would be nice if she did another anime make up tutorial hehe 

Maybe like the ones she did featuring Rize from Tokyo Ghoul / Hatsune Miku from Vocaloid/ NANA 

I really loved the NANA one that she did. Its been super long since she made that video but its still one of my favourites 🌸
You're sooo sweet! Care so much about our life & give amazing advice. Thank you so much xx
Please do a morning routine xx
How long should you stay at an internship for? After two weeks at my internship, I was doing routine work and there was nothing left for me to learn. So now I keep internship/job hopping which is a bad thing I assume
Michelle I really miss the old fashioned makeup tutorials
Can u please post a makeup tutorial u never make them any more 😔😓
Michelle phan can u please make another makeup tutorial i love them!!
When are you going to upload a tutorial? It's been while 😅
This is so timely for me! I'll start my internship on Tuesday~ thank you so much, Michelle! 😁❤
Michelle be like I'm gonna post more vids doesn't post vids in a month
Hi michelle !!! This is a request. Pls get back your makeup tutorials. We all are really missing them. You are a makeup guru. We know that you are busy, but please take some time out for yourself and do some good makeup tutorials. As a subscriber and as an audience, I have sent my request to you. Now it completely depends upon you that what videos you want to make. hope you read it. Love <3 from India.
I'm really in love with these career talks right now :)
pleas do a makeup tutorial😃just like the good old days
you rarely post vidoes.
woah!! your so cool michelle
Is Michele pregnant she covered up her belly with  jacket and a pillow twice
i miss you Misch!..I've been busy one of these days making my own YouTube channel with my own. and its all because of you the first time I saw you on youtube 2 years ago . I said to myself to have my own channel soon. you are my inspiration.
i am just learning now but unfortunately I am the only one who do all things but that's ok i know i will learn and improve more in this craft. thank you for inspiring me Michelle phan.
i hope you can also visit my channel and try to comment for more improvement.. thank you and God bless

HOT POTATO CHANNEL
this was helpful but you look soooo flawless today
I'm a vet tech at a vet clinic so I get to wear scrubs, one less thing to worry about 😀
Hello Michelle 😊
U r so inspiring !!!!
i swear to god if you upload a pillow talk, trend report or career talk again, i will shoot myself. Legit 20 of them in a row what happened to the makeup vids mish???
Hey Michelle you have perfect last name sooo perfect
what sort of stuff do you talk about when you keep in touch with people on your internship
was waiting for this <3
Maybe she's not making make up videos cause she's pregnant
Hi Mish!  I love the fact you are branching into lifestyle videos, so happy to see your channel grow!
please make makeup viduo's
Thks Michelle and Lauren for having a Career talk section, Im looking for an internship and these talks really useful for me in getting one successful internship <3 <3 <3
Michelle, alongside these career talks, you may also want to give us a make up look for interns! Love ya!
if following these steps is what it takes to be successful, I pass on the "successful" and the career experience altogether. thanks.
when will you do a make up tutorial?
thank you for all of your advice through pillow talk it helped m 93rd land a great part time job and this could open a bunch of doors for me in the long run i cant thank you enough
Gap, Target. Buy key pieces as The Intern Queen said. White button down shirts . White Gap tees over a navy or black blazer. 
Stay in touch with your business contacts. 
Lastly, always be professional. Work is work , and do not share personal info .
Love you Michelle ❤️✨

I love, love, love, LOVE these videos, Michelle! They are very, very helpful. But please do makeup tutorials, too! I kinda miss those :)
Where have you been? I miss your videos so bad. It is so disappointing checking your channel but there's no new video 😭😭😭😭😭
MICHELLE PLEEEASEEEE MAKE A ROOM TOUR/NIGHT ROUTINE
WHERE ARE THE MAKEUP TUTORIAAAAALS? love you
hey michelle ... you are my ideal .. i love you sooo muchh.. plzz let us know how you start your work
OMG I AM EARLY
Michelle Phan,
You have been a true inspiration to me. When it comes to make-up, inspiring, or tutorials, I've tried them all and have followed and adored your videos throughout the years. My only complaint is that I wish you would upload more tutorials or make-up videos like you used to. These new videos are educational and definitely helpful, but I wish there were more tutorials. Just know that growing up from a tomboy background, and having little to no friends or being afraid to dress up and bust of my self-conscience shell, I was able to find hope in your videos and be inspired to try new things and make-up styles that I would never dream of.
Thank you for being the hope and inspiration, and more or less of the older sister who has helped me to grow and learn about new things throughout these years.
You're wonderful and beautiful. 

Sincerely,
Tabbi
This is so helpful!!!! Love you Mishxx
I love you so much Michelle💕💕
Chưc chị thành công.
Dang I don't have any dresses or skirts :P Better go shopping :D But all jokes aside thanks for the video, I took some great points from it!
Thank you! I'm about to have an internship next July, so this really helps a lot! x
yeah i love this topic! Good news is that I'm going to be the intern in of of the fashion industry that appears frequently in fashion show 😳
You can find makeup tutorials everywhere and anywhere on YouTube some are even similar to each other. This is way more helpful than makeup tutorials, she's the only one making content like this, thank you Mish!!♥️
Thank you Michelle for helping me and others gain success, and keep everything professional.
helped alot 👌👍
I love this but I miss your make up videos 😞
Thank you, Michelle! I started watching  your videos a long time ago. And now I feel that we are growing together. I'm a brazilian girl with so much dreams, and you help me come true. Ive learned  english watching your videos and now I'm in a process of interview for a internship of a global company , that was possible only because i push myself to keep learning and trying. You taught me that. Sorry for my english :p wish you the best!
Love this series!
Mish is such a good soul.😚
Woo hoo 💖 You go Michelle 😉 Love your videos btw

First comment
I ❤️ these career talk videos
This is incredibly helpful! So many videos point out the basic: "be friendly and don't be late" but I like these specific steps to follow.
EArly :)
they look so pink it makes me feel like my eyes are playing up 😔
Love these videos Michelle!! So helpful
This was fantastic! I'll be interning the summer after next, and this was so helpful - I love that you focused on things other than the obvious (be professional, dress appropriately, etc.)! xx
I would love to see some more videos on the em channel
Michelle, can you pleaseeeeee make a video which highlights all the steps you took to finally get you to where you are in life business wise. It would be extremely helpful for people like myself who are struggling to find that opportunity to launch. 😊
Lauren 🍔
These intern videos have been so helpful! I got my very first internship that I applied to for this summer and its nice to have tips going into it!
I know these videos don't get a lot of views but they are so helpful and amazing!!! Thank you
is this even still a makeup channel 😭😭
loved this!

is Dom still her her boyfriend? Also this is my first comment
i love those so much!! thank you
Plzzzzzzz do an angel tarot card reading video / tutorial
I love that you make these useful videos as a beauty guru. Most just talks about makeup, buy more expensive clothes,etc. not knowing that they do have a younger audience, and these types of videos might even help them along the road.
Oh I have 2 questions that I need help badly.
If I want to work in a certain industry yet I do not have any relevant experience(work and academic wise) in the industry what should I do to get in that industry.
And if the country I live in does not have demands in that industry, is it possible to get internship or job in another country?
Thank you!!😭😭🙏🏻
Michelle is the cutest thing when she watched the snapchats😍
guessing an internship is it the equivilent of work experience? (we call in the uk)     how do you get work experience when you have no work experience to get work experience?
This was so useful!
i love you michelle, we all do :)
Hii 💘💘
michelle, please consider doing a video on productivity and how to approach long term vs short term goals.
Hi Michelle ! I love you so much you have been such such an inspiration :) Thank you for the motivations and make up tutorials. How about a 1 brand make up tutorial? say Wet n Wild ;) ? Love you !!!
makeup video?
can you active the sub title for the french viewer please ? you are very pretty michelle ＼(^o^)／
you should do more makeup tutorials.
I totaly hate your videos!! Noo just joking! They are really usefull thank you very much!!
copionas de la pascualina
Estas hermosa
omg i want an outfuit and makeup breakdown for what michelle is wearing!!
Man that top or whatever it is was really bothering me 😂 looks like a Snuggie 😆
tis is so usefull☺
Dear Michelle, how can I become more confident in myself? I have a dream job but I'm too scared to ask my mom for help getting there. I even a little scared to ask about getting  just a part time job and getting my license. Please help! I don't want to be scared forever!
Thanks!
MJ
very helpful!
Idk who she is but is her second name Phan because damn I'm jealous of her second name, if your in the phandom you will get why
her nail polishes in the backround though.
Hi Michelle, I just want to say I miss your make up tutorials. It's been 4 moths since the last one. Recently, I've been loving matcha because now it's everywhere. It's becoming a trend. Can you do a makeup tutorial that is matcha inspired? love you! <3
i miss her make up tutorials 😯
Love how you help with all these videos!
Thank you for the video  , I am going to intern at Microsoft in the summer and I can't wait :)
I love it whenever you post a video! your videos are always so on point. :) I want to see more videos like this  and about trend reports, college and travel! :)
i dont know why "fans" of michelle phan hates this series... its very helpful!
love this
Hey Michelle! I was just wondering if you could do a video about trying to find a job that makes you happy and successful instead of trying to choose. Thanks!
I just wonder why is life so un fair:(
love u mish!!
What happened to Em Cosmetics? I feel the company/line faded into obscurity and I've never seen any other youtubers reach for its products outside of first impression videos when the line was first launched
Thx Michelle
Nice vedio😀
Hey can em cosmetics make a tinted moistuarizer please!!! and an eyeshadow palette with earth tone colors!!! that would be the bestttttt
Is her and Dom still dating?
What an awesome video. Our light a lot of young people need guidance in this area. Often times they simply don't know. To produce content like this that can help someone is very beneficial to more people than you can imagine.  Good stuff, Mish! - Eno
Are you vietnamese? Cause I am
If Fousey ate his chipotle I would have watched this video earlier ! 😬😝
Pls. Do a makeup starter kit
Thank you Michelle. Not only you are making women beautiful, you are also inspiring young ladies to start taking actions.
I miss your makeup and beauty videos... I hardly come by any more because you barely post : /
Love!!!
Thinks that your first when really there are like millions already commenting and watching
These are awesome tips, but i can't get an intern :(
I really love these! I wish there would be more episodes like for first time employees, people who are struggling to look for a job after years of trying, and for entrepreneurs! That would be of great help~ 💖
Omgg does anyone know where she bought her knit jumper? So cute! 💗
i wanna buy the all work no pay book but can't find here in Japan!!!
I love these videos so much, they help me a lot! But.... are the tutorials coming back soon?
☁️🌿youtube friends anyone??🌿☁️ 
im new to youtube 👽🤘🏼
it feels hard for me to get a job because i haven't done any extracurriculars, have no work experience, no volunteer experience, and haven't joined any programs/clubs during high school (i'm almost done with it). i'm not even actively involved in anything. i'm a taciturn and a very introverted person, and i look younger than my age which makes it even more harder! i have to put in more effort than the extroverted and those who look older than their age or look their age! who wants to hire a teen that literally looks like a kid! I feel like no employer is going to hire me. :( i just want to die and start over with my life. this world is like survival of the fittest.
Thank you so much I'm going on my first internship and I've been so scared and this really helped to chill me out and give me confidence :)
Hey, just wondering what is a good way to keep in touch with your professional contacts? Like, what is an example of what you could say in an email? Thanks
-_-
😘
love you michelle :-)
Why am i watching this i'm still at freshman year of college
More Makeup tutorials please?:) can you do Harley Quinn?
whats it like doing an intership? was it hard? in really curious cause im looking into doing this but i want an personal experience that someone had.
Are all the tips u guys gave in the  videos included in the book too? Please reply! My dream is to become a well known make up artist this could really help. Love you xx
It's been 4 weeks since she has made this video omg😡
I miss you michelle
watching this because of grey's anatomy hahaha
You have to realize that Michelle is growing as a person, just like any of you does. She's more than that YouTube girl that does make up tutorials now. Yes, she's still that girl, but that is not only what she does. She's an entrepreneur that has a goal of helping people reach their dreams and create. 

I find it really confusing that some people react negatively to what she currently creates because it's not the same as the..."old things". Things change, people. It can get better or worse, and I honestly can't see in anyway that Michelle's work quality is going worse.
Can you make a make-up look please
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS CUTE.
When are you gonna post tutorials
Michelle is slaying. Loving her clothes
She talks down to everyone lol
mish, your top is adorbs but the floppy sleves are distracting.
anyone else obsessed with Michelle and her aesthetic? x
Hi Michelle... is there a way i can interact with u or mail u ... anything ... please please let me know....looking forwarded...

Ilysm
Yas
I know you've evolved your channel, and I like it. But I miss the old videos. Like old tutorials and stuff. It feels less about makeup than it used to.
I would faint if you would reply :D
But what exactly are we supposed to email them about three times a year?
I want her to make another makeup video
I can so relate to this series now that I got my first full time corporate job! Is it safe to give food gift(korean rice cake) to your colleague for thank you?
Exactly! I re-subscribed Michelle Phan after learning that most of her recent content could benefit my life and career which I am always genuinely interested in on videos. Her makeup tutorials did not interest me at all as I am not a makeup enthusiast. And now that her newest videos are worthy of attention in ways you could learn from, these are the type of videos her viewers, especially the youth, should at least TRY to listen to. It would be really sad to know her younger viewers just rely on makeup tutorials, hauls, YouTuber challenges, and all those common videos that aren't of any value. Therefore, in my opinion, Michelle is doing an absolutely fine job giving out advice nowadays! I am SO happy she is taking another different route and branching off her channel.
awsome
can someone explain to me what an internship is - is it like an apprenticeship?
what is an internship?? : s
I love you Michelle!!!!
It would be funny if you were a Dan and Phil fan
Love this episode! Thank you so much for this feature! I recently got an internship for a research organization & felt like I succeeded and don't need to do anything else now that my foot is in the door. But with your questions Michelle and Lauren's tips, reassured me my work is not complete just yet. Definitely adding this video to my favorites and will refer to it constantly next semester!
Michelle how do i  deal with my short hair which I don't know how to style
65th
The guest kinda reminds me of Aria's mum from Pretty Little Liars
does she still work for em?
I love these!
Michelle was really sweet, but I really don't like the guest.
hey Michelle!!! Well, I am Brazilian, but when I get older I want to study in the USA, so, how is the universities system there?? I'll be so happy if you answer me. Kisses from Brazil and I love you!!
what happened to dom?
Michelle, I use to follow you religiously ever since your rice bunny xanga, but nowadays not really. I feel like now your videos only cater to young girls, not women. I miss your sexy looks and fashion for women with chriselle lim! Now it seems like you are catering to just high schoolers and college kids. It would be cool if you provided more mature content for women. Advice for women, topics for women and looks for women!
I am missing all of the makeup videos it seems like this channel as forgotten about all of that
I've been a pretty harsh critic of your channel in the past, but I have to admit that it got better now with the educational videos featuring other people. I think you're a pretty good interviewer. I have (at least) two major internships coming up in the next 7 months and I have to admit these videos are very helpful.
hi Michelle I'm not a YouTube channel but can you make your month favorites like your summer favorites or spring favorites pls I'm requested...
Can u post more makeup tutorials please
Michelle this video is very sweet and cut and good. please I have a whish can you make a video haw girls can impresse boys or something like that. Thank you so much.
Hì
pleas make gisha's make up something japanese :(
please do a room for mermaids
such a fail

Where are you?
I just finished an internship at a hospital and my supervisor was always busy but always made time for me. 8/10 she would put aside what she was doing to help me, right there and then. She was incredibly patient and helpful.
Why does every youtuber now who like reached their max they start posting slower and slower until it is a video a week. I am not trying to be mean. I love her videos but I am just pointing it all out.
Oh my god please stop making these videos and make makeup tutorials
Nice :)
Wow

So helpful! I'm doing an internship soon at a small clothing boutique soon:)
Is dope2111 your sister-in-law?
michelle where are you?
I miss michelle phan's makeup tutorials 😢. where is she ? I kind of bored with this kind of video. and she show herself like once a month 😡 with this kind of video. 😠💔
Why is there no more make up videos :( I miss them ... But i still love you, Michelle ~
nice!!
Hi!!!! I was wondering, could you do a Career Talk for Colleges as well? It's a stressful time, and it's hard to know what to put and what not to put on your applications, ho much is goo how much is TMI, vital points that help you stad out, interviews, etc... THANKS!
Love this video!!! :)
No hate but why are you not doing makeup tutorials anymore
we all like to have longer sleeves and oversized cloths, but that actually doesn't look cute at all.
LOVE
This is a tutorial channel......its been four months since you posted anything related to make up..it isn't that hard..your content is terrible.
to the people who wish she'd do more makeup tutorials, don't y'all care about anything other than makeup?
Hello
she doesn't do her makeup tutorials anymore :/
hi, thanks for doing there videos! this was kind of addressed in the first one, but how do you even find your first internship? I have two problems: 1) most of my friends find their internships through previous internships so if you're not already connected, how do you find out about who is looking for an intern? 2) so many internships ask for "previous experience," so how can you show that you are capable and willing to be committed and learn without having "proof" (past internships). thanks again!
Can u post more makeup tutorials? The reason I started watching your channel was because I fell in love with your tutorials. As nice as these inspirational videos and such are there's too many of them compared to makeup which is the reason most of your subs are probably here.
ok I love Michelle but like i feel like her videos are lacking a bit, I understand shes busy but its a lot of the same that coming out, not a huge fan of the career or pillow talks all too much the trend reports are nice to watch though. But I wish her makeup tutorials would come back and ones that dont seem repetitive. I noticed that when em was launch she may have been really busy and the channel got better in production value which was cool to see but the tutorials began to lack and even with the life stuff was a bit recycled from past videos. I love Michelle regardless and am always anticipating everyone of her videos because I know she is a very hardworking and dedicated individual.
hi
in my work when you offer help once even if its not your job, the next time they will ask you to do it and the next thing you know , you will be obligated to do it.. and then if its not done , youll get the blame. yes it happened!
Really love your videos!
I hate your sweater 💀 but I love you lol
Michelle, hello? Where's the new video hunny. It's been 1 month.
Her channel has become so boring.
Michelle you are awesome.... just say me when you will publish your new video in a week.I mean which day you will publish please say me the day.......
Can we get more career talk vids
cool :)
I didn't like you're last videos,pllzzz :makeup,makeup,makeup
Like and your crush will punch you :))
How come the views are low with having 8.5 million subs?
I'm happy that Mish is creating so many interesting topics & videos on it!! I'm addicted to her blog & this channel <3 Thumbs up if you are too:)
i miss michelle's makeup tutos but i love the direction shes going to ❤️ like she doesnt need to do tutos anymore because yall are gonna complain abt how shes doing the same thing over and over
Love
Wear a pencil skirt during an internship? I think this is only suitable in the fashion industry but nowhere else.
Подскажите как и где есть перевод этого видео?
I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos when looking at the likes and views they get. She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots
Hola, Tu Hablas Español.?
Is she with her boyfriend??
What is ipsy dress code?
why dosen't she make makeup tutorial videos anymore... :(
I don't like her career talking with people they are boringgggggg
shes the intern queen and you're the youtube queen
Just adorable! Pasen por mis videos en español! Tengo nuevos tutoriales de maquillaje también hechos con mucho cariño y dedicación. Besos y abrazos desde Chile!
😃😃😃😃
Cute

Dear Michelle, my name is Beccah, and I am 13 years old. A few weeks ago my mom and decided that it was okay for me to start wearing makeup. I'm completely lost and I have no idea what to buy, because my mother doesn't wear much makeup so I don't really have a guideline to follow. I have slightly sensitive skin that can get oily and or dry at times and I have a small amount of acne. Not to mention I am VERY pale. I was also wondering if you could help me come up with something to do about my pale complexion. I do not tan easily but I do burn.... PLEASE HELP! I doubt you'll see this but if you could help I would really appreciate it! I love you btw!
Does anyone know a website or something where I can find an internship as a teenager in LA county???
Ъмм,здравей Мишел. Искам да знаеш че много харесвам твоя стил и бих се радвала (момиче съм нищо че профилът ми е мъжки) ако качваш павече DIY клипчета! Както вече си разбрала аз съм от България. Много бих се радвала ако отговориш на моят коментар( I'm sorry че е толкова дълък)Очаквам!!!!!  I love you from Bulgaria!!!!!!!!😘😚💋👄💘💘💘
hi hello
FIRST OMG
Rubbish
It's literally been three months since your last makeup tutorial. I get that you want to make new videos, but make a new channel for them, most of your subscribers are here because of your makeup. Stop ignoring what got you to where you are.
First
the pink sweater is the prettiest sweater Ive ever seen..
Sorry but I don't like these career talks. Boring
Is anyone else feel outdated in style sitting in their room  wearing a potato costume?
Really missing the makeup/hair tutorials and diys. Even a favorites video would be awesome! Just feels like it's all been pillow talks and trend reports lately and I love those too but switching it up would be nice :(
People get weirder and weirder these days, lol
Finally, after 5 years of silver hair, chunky heels, and a lifetime of freckles I'm finally trendy!
"Raise your right hand and repeat after me: I will not download the musical.ly app" (-Chloe from vine)
I want to try the body contour sticks!
i love the trend reports that you have made!!!
Always love when you do this!
those faux freckles look really bad
Do more of these trends report :)
I really do not get body contouring
this is my favorite series everrrrr!!! yassss
I always love your vids but I miss seeing your face!!
Again Michelle , your editing goes beyond the moon and the starts . Would you by any change show us some tricks you use when you edit ? I know it´s all about creativity and you sure are a true ARTIST by creating this lovely videos that go beyond on everything on YouTube. It´s a shame we didn't see you in the video. Hopefully next time ;) Lots of love <3  xx
The new team is so cool. They are all gorgeous! Love this video!
WHEN WILL MICHELLE END HER TREND REPORTS AND PILLOW TALKS STOP THE MADNESS
WHERE DID THE MAKEUP GO?!?!?!?!?
I want more beauty videos, and less pillow talks and trend reports:)

don't get me  wrong, these videos are ok, but I subscribed for you makeup videos and skincare tutorials <3
Bangtan boys using freckles and its trend now wow wow woow 
#bangtaninfires 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Big love for this report series but I am dying for more makeup tutorials
Bucket hats are so cool, but i look so bad with them, lol
Why would any one wear grills??? (Sp?)
for someone who has actual freckles, I can't stand having them ):
Michelle's voice is so soothing.
I could literally fall asleep to the sound of your voice
yassssss thank you so much for adding musical.ly for apps!😀😀😀😀
You should check out @brettsu on instagram. His photos are so unique and interesting! :-)
Don't follow trends, just be yourself..
Nothing in the world will ever make me wear grills, I don't care how "trendy" it is.
whoa I like the idea of leg contouring! another alternative: when you apply self tanner, apply more on the inner and outer sides of your legs. it's a little trick that works well for me :) love Riri in this! she's bae <3
This was such a cool video!
 I also just posted a video with this really cool trend where you use rings for your braids!  💖
that moment when she talks about glitter freckles, you think of Jungkook's forever young photoshoot
Please make a makeup tutorial <3
Anyways I still love your videos I just miss your old makeup based days.
damn her legs looked so good after she contoured and highlighted them. also enjoyed the vid, hope to see a makeup tutorial soon😘
I live for trend reports! But these trends were extremely bizarre!! 🙀
Omg! you made Helios femina?! that's amazing! I just ran into your channel by chance and it's amazing. I had no idea haha! anyway new subscriber
Can you make a channel that about art tutorials!!!





Like if agree!!  :)
I wore faux freckles today 😭💖👌🏽
Imma try out this happify thing bec I am one pessimistic person
Omg that colorful pastel jacket, the same one Hayley Williams used in the Still Into You music video 😍
What happened to the make up tutorials??
I feel like glitter freckles will look really cute at a music festival, rave, Ne Years party, etc <3
we are slowly turning into the Capitol
Don't get me wrong - I'm totally into this fun season - but I feel like sparkly faux freckles and body contouring are definitely going to be two of those trends that we'll regret in ten years or so. Kind of like how my mom reacts whenever she looks at old photos of herself sporting an 80s' fringe. ^^' (But then again - most trends have a limited life span.)
Personally, I feel like body contouring is taking it a bit too far. :/ While I agree that we should all do whatever makes us happy, it begs the question of how "happy" someone truly is if they need to cover their entire body in makeup in order to feel good about themselves. Not judging anyone - I'm just a bit worried about where this trend might be heading and what consequences it might have.

I'm definitely digging the brightly coloured hair trend, though! :)
Michelle is the ONLY youtuber I've ever heard telling her viewers to give a thumbs down if they're not digging it. WOW!! she is so dedicated
I miss Michelle's makeup tutorials.. this channel just feels empty.. I'm proud of all her success, but I can't help but miss the old Michelle
I've never seen anyone doing glitter freckles except Karen O and I doubt that I will ever see anyone wearing glitter freckles IRL.
When she mentioned musical.ly I was so happy
Mine is Shiningdiamond_jv
Litterally me :
sees title
Grills aren't a tre-
vid underneath has a girl with grills in the thumbnail
Oh.
musically rice gum sqaud where u at 😂
Totally nailed saying 'faux freckles' five times😂
The tooth cover things...why?!?!?!  They look so awful and ridiculous D:
Michelle please consider shipping ipsy prodcuts worldwide? I know easier said than done but they bags look soooo cool! 
Btw love you heaps and keep up the great work 😘😘
somehow your outro always makes me feel a little sad
You should check out @thefourthjonas on Instagram.  She photoshops herself with celebrities and all her pictures look sooo real haha!
whenever i see a notification coming from you i thought it would be a make-up tutorial <///3
Your videos are sooosososo nicely edited 😍
Love these trend reports so much! <3
MICHELLE I CANT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR FEATURING ME I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤
My name is Riria (@NeonCrownRiri) who had this amazing opportunity to be in Michelle's trending report. I had noticed that couple of people had pointed out about how they felt some cultural inappropriations toward to me, wearing grills (grillz) which Michelle introduced as a part of custom jewelry which is trending in Japan. (Not started in Japan). In my humble opinion, the way we have been trading cultures is beautiful and trying new things out of your own culture/heritage is one way of showing respect to the people from those communities. Just like how "Kimono" is popular in certain style now but it's actually originated to a Japanese traditional outfit. But from my perspective, who is actually a Japanese, I had never felt offended by seeing non-Japanese people dressing in them. To be honest, I'd rather say I feel proud of how my own culture took off to the rest of the world and being loved. At the same time Japanese Kimono is originated from Chinese culture from thousands of years ago. Furthermore, Japanese "Kimono" itself is a great example of how cultures have always been traded even back on thousands of years ago. The look of kimono is very similar with other Asian countries' traditional outfits such as "Chima jeogori" from Korea and "Hanfu" from China. Therefore our cultures have always been traded and influenced each other. For whom it may concern why I was wearing my braids (cornrows) and grills, I truly respect Hip Hop culture as one musician and hoping to share its style with who has the same heart. In the end, I apologize for any of my linguistic errors. I am not a native in English and have only been 4 years since I started learning the language. I tried my best to share my personal opinion and what has been written here is nothing to do with the team. So if you have any questions, please ask me. NOT the team. Thank you.
I thought I wasn't subscribed to you anymore because I haven't been seeing your videos on my feed for a long time. 😳
When I saw musical.ly 😒
Michelle Phan is my trend goal! 🙌💕
I love these trend reports and your editing skills!  ^^
Luv luv luv this trend report!!! Thanks so much Michelle and the team behind this!!!!

I'm trying to get rid of my freckles aaaaaand she's packing them on lol
I was in shock in the way that girl contour her leg!! It looks AMAZING!!!! So gonna buy it!
I like how she removed the first version of this video saying that "grills" we're a hot new trend 🤔
does everyone kind of just miss her old makeup videos..? I mean of course I love these but... idk... not tryna piss anyone off just :(
for the helios femina comic, i think each chapter should have it's own music, like you did with the homepage, that would give good vibes
wow michelle is replying to some messages even though her video was up ages ago
btw i love your vids they're amazing! Great editing as always
I miss her makeup tutorials :(
You didn't talk about the rainbow highlighter! It's been everywhere :o

You're friends are beautiful btw 😻😍 @Michelle phan
when im in a hurry, i just walk out the door  >_<
Michelle should do more makeup videos
Hello !!
Nice video 💕Your super great;))☆｡◕‿◕｡)ﾉ♡☆,｡･:*:☆彡
❤️❤️Thank you for a good video ❤️❤️
Michelle please do some traditional tutorials again! I miss seeing you in the videos~
YES THESE ARE MY FAVORITE VIDEOS
RICEGUM MUSICAL.LY SQUAD SHOW ME YOUR L'S
Custom grill trend... I hated it then and I still hate it now! #TackyAF
Absolutely love these trend reports! They always feel like a little birthday gift in my sub box. ^^
Highly appreciate the effort that the whole team puts to bring out these trend reports.. I have been a great fan of this series... already looking forward to the next ones :) Love you Mish :*
love this! also that girl's undercut is AMAZING!
If you want faux freckles I highly suggest the temporary freckle  tattoos (aka beauty marks) from "Mr. Kate'!
I'm living for these trend reports. I've watched the last two ones about 20 times each. No lie.
Can you please do another 'Beauty Basics' video on how to find your skin type / how to keep your skin clear/ how type of cleansers etc. to use for your skin type 

P.S Love you Mish ❤️❤️💞
I love these kinds of videos! It's like I have an older sister letting me know the 411 lol
ilysm +Michellephan I love watching your videos! and I've been watching you for ages I love you, your my inspiration ♥♥
Love these...✌️❣
A really beautiful Instagram account is @taramilktea 👈🏼❤️
I love these trend reports. But I REALLY miss your makeup tutorials. Are you not going to do them anymore?
When I saw Musical.ly as an app trend I literally choked on my saliva 😂
This. Is. Amazing!
the freckles are so pretty
I didn't like any of these trends.. and how is freckles a trend?!
I absolutely love these videos, keep doing them!! 👑💗
@katejerryy is an awesome instagram account full of positive artwork!
Wad up notification squad ???
lol love you and your tips
You should feature chloetersigni on gram gallery. Her art is amazing!
thank you for such an inspiring video😚
I dont like the trend reports...I want good old creative makeup tutorials.. :/
làm video tiếng Việt Nam đi chị 😍
@hlcyon is one of my favorite Instagram accounts <3
i love how this is so helpful and so fun to watch (like always) thanks for the hardwork queen em!!
I don't want to be mean but all this seems a bit too much 
do people in america really go out like that contoured from top to bottom and with freckles drawn on their faces;;
i want to see Michelle's face not the faces of random girls
I liked this trend report!! Loved seeing Sisi around here! <3
I luv your vids, they are just so calming and they are really good quality.
your...your name..p...PHaN coNFirMED!!!! nice video tbh :)
what are the name of these shoes? 5:25
Gram gallery suggestion: @choi_seung_hyun_tttop 
Lol. 😂
All the trends you showed are cool but not the grills...
We all know good and well that the grills "trend" didn't start up in Tokyo, Michelle. 

Even though I don't take a huge on cultural appropriation, but this is ridiculous. For as long as grills existed and started in Hip Hop with Hood origins, it would automatically bring a negative connotation when we, Blacks would sport them. 

So please, next time you advertise rocking something from another culture than your own, please give the CORRECT credit where it's due. Not the friendly, watered down YouTube version your bubbly fanbase can swallow. 
xx
ah finally, us freckles faces have been taunted long enough, it's time the freckles become a thing. :D
wait....isn't that Asian girl supposed to be a beauty newbie? her face is flawless man
Who would ever wear glitter freckles? LOL 😝 trends are getting weirder every second
@diamondcelebration~~
01:35 OMG SHE LOOKS LIKE HOODY KIM
Girl I ain't got time to contour my damn body haha
You should feature @thelessismore on Instagram!! I love her
love this series💕💕
Girl those faux freckles look pretty bad. Glamngore does a full tutorial on how to make them realistic but those are legit just dots
I like how she doesn't pressure us to like instead she tells us to like or unlike if u want. Unlike SOME other people
I was feeling down and was really glad this was uploaded ❤️
Your voice makes me happy.
Hope to see you in your next videos..
Really miss you
watching your videos is already a healing to me 
please don't cease to make fantastic videos !
xoxo
correct me if im wrong
ipsy sends u products than u send then back or keep them?
also
MICHAEL IS AMAZING
omggg the Hair styles look so slick and goregous 😍
When you naturally have freckles and don't have to worry about drawing them on
Omg I definitely remember that hot chocolate bronzer tutorial you did way back 😆🍫🍫💖
I love jenerbeatrice instagram actually, but i dont think you care 😂
I just read the first chapter of your comic book. the art work is amazing, and I already like the bunny creature Bebo. Nice job, I'm going back to read some more.
i loove these  kind of videos....i mean, i love all your videos Mish
and i love you and i miss you too
I love these videos!  but it has been 10 videos since you actually done a makeup look.
Always rejuvenating, your videos Michelle! <3
Thank you for uploading on my birthday!
so is grillz making a comeback?
yAMAGUCCI WITH THAT FAUX FRECKLES

I absolutely love your trend reports, they are so well-made and just great to watch! :) ♥ 
You are such an inspiration to me, thank youfor blessing the Youtube community with your videos! ❤
Michelle,I love your new videos but...I miss tutorials so much!!
SIENNA SPALDING!!!!
Scented makeup is nice but not flavored gloss etc...
The app is called Glitche not Gliche tho!!
I miss your old videos
You're beautiful I get so excited every time a new video comes out, Xo 🍫❤️🌂💋
You never post  makeup vids anymore😭😭😭😭
Love u girl so genius u r ❤️❤️
Definitely into the glitter freckles, trying this at my next music festival! 💖
casually covers up real freckles to create more 'realistic' freckles.
Basically my life.
ahhhhhh. my girl Riria on your videos now? shes so talented
I love that glitter freckles are a thing now ^-^
When I saw the freckles I remembered Suga when they did the Young Forever album photo shoot. Any ARMYs?
gram gallery: @sergeysuxov and @tashalakoz
their pics are insanely creative and colorful!
1:59 Someone call Bongyoung he wants his pants back
Dude, seriously no rainbow highlighter? :O
ok what happened to makeup tutorials like that's why I subscribed.. :( 
this is ok though.
Love all these trends! why didn't I see them sooner, like before my trip?! XD
You should feature @_isaacjrz in your Gram Gallery! Great illustrations that deserve attention!!
Wow that Asian girl is beautiful! Soooo unique! My dream look if I could pull it off.
@charlottekk8 uses clean edge rad silver grey designs on insta and is's the future of cold aesthetics
OMG MISH HELIOS:FEMINA IS SO GOODDDDD <333 Can't wait for chapter 8! You've inspired me to share my sci-fi/fantasy novel online! :)
For Instagram: ConnorTD (Conner Dwyer) amazing guy and lovely photos.
I love glitter freckles but I wouldn't know when to wear it ><
a color story isn't on android :(
please do a makeup tutorial. I need more
I'm not really into any of these trends😅except maybe gold/copper eyeshadows for summer😎 Too Faced peaches palette seems good (colors) but I'm really NOT a fan of scented beauty products (don't want them to smell like food wth). Those relaxation apps are a bit weird since they keep stimulating your brain instead of trying to make it pause/cool down at bit(which is one of the purpose of meditation).
I'm sure some ppl like these trends and found some cool new apps thanks to this vid but no so much for me (not giving a thumb down tho😉)
I am enjoying this series so much
Go Trend Report!☺
Yess! Trend reports are my faves!!❤️😭 ure my inspiration ily.
feature fetchingtigers/annegienschilling! ilysm michelle. 💞💕

Hi michelle! I study architecture and photography. I would love you to take a look at my Instagram page. Main focus is architecture and showing my point of view about common things we see in life. 
Love from Argentina! 
Bicky

SIENNA OH MY GOD I LOVE HER

The app is named "Glitché", not Gliche.
Musical.ly 4 life
Michelle, I loved headspace as a beginner meditation app but try out the calm.com app too! It's more in depth and has amazing meditative music and scenery. Love the suggestions! xx
Can u make a make up tutorial for Yui from sword art on line

Sienna! Yasss!
this is the first time i ever hear a youtuber ask for a thumbs down! haha

lovely creation as always
Is the girl with the space buns one of the girls in get black heart?
Michelle videos will never go out of trend
Hey Michelle! Great video as always, but I was wondering something.
Would you ever consider looking through some of your fans' Instagram accounts and recommending/featuring them? 
It might help the sense of fan community, and help us boost each other's confidence. Also, you'd see more of your fans and their lives, their interests, and their creativity. 
Anyways, just a thought. 🌸
Scented makeup irritates my skin just thinking about it... Not sure why anyone would want that. Leave the scents to perfume and body sprays
Why don't you feature in your videos more often? Instead of other models?
Is the IPSY bag you showed for May or April??😊btw I love you so much!!
Knew It was you 

BTW best Webtoon ever
im melissa.i love your trend report videos they're amazing! another amazing video! ur so pretty mish! c:
I think @spaceofmalik is a really cool account
I like to watch Michelle's videos before bed because the end music is so relaxing<3
Being part of this video was so much fun! Thank you Michelle! xoxo
guys....WHERE IS MICHELLE?!
Wauw, I admire how much effort you put in every video and pretty much everything you work on. thumbs up!
All ur videos are so relaxing 😫💖
It takes me quite sometime to search for 'Gliche' it's actually Glitché
For gram gallery please use @aliyazula please!!!!!!!!
dude bucket hats and grills are not new trends
siennaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! <3
Would love to see less trend report😊 and more makeup vids and videos like mastering the art of oils (super informative) loved it more vids similar  to that would be greatly appreciated
what color correcting pallete is this pls reply man
I loooove these trend reports.
GO MLP
completely fangirls and ignores rest of video LOL
Love this. But it would help if the apps mentioned were in the description box for access. :)
It's literally been 3 months since an actual make up tutorial was uploaded:(
the girls you use in these video's are SO beautiful. I love these kind of videos... they're just perfect. yis
I live for colored freckles, too bad I'm a mom of too and would look like a complete fool rockin' them! lol Love you Mish!
I hope she posts a makeup tutorial soon, she's my favorite you tuber <3
Are mish and her bf still together ?
idk if anyone cares but i also just discovered the app Eve. and it's for your period. i used to use period tracker which i love! but this one has a cool discussion board and it tells you pretty interesting facts on what ur body is doing during ur period days. and it has quizzes, it free too:D
Pretty soon she will have someone else do the voice over.
Why you don't linked the shoes?😢❤
The tech trend now is musicly!! Lol
icant find the patternator 😩
I haven't watched one of your videos in a long time! ! I missed how much information I would get out if just one video! lol
I freaking love you are so helpful
I'd love almost all of these trends! <3
the benefit tinted lash primer is ome of my fave things rn
I think it's awesome how you're putting other Youtubers in your video and referring them but I want to see you more Michelle :-(
I rly want Riria Niimura's jacket and shorts <3
Love this vid! <3
That hair is Dope, I would say Golden as in first place....but its a rainbow....ergo Dope....yup, logic.
I love the unicorn-rainbow multicolour hair but unfortunatedly I work as a nurse.... huhu....
gram gallery : @pastelpriencess
sisi!!! love you!
It has been all about your work, and that's exciting to, but I miss some good old fashion tips and tricks from you! Trend reports and pillow talks are great to. I haven't seen a video of yours, for a while... Because of that... I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I'm a real "Phan" anymore❤️❤️ ilysm!!
i really love your voice ❤
@fetching_tigerss!!
kpabz_ on ig!!

I need your make up tutorials back. NEED.
you should do a packing essentials for vacation video!!
gram gallery @amyborenstein
здорово,круто(cool)!))
I like the trend reports and pillow talk but i've been looking foward to a makeup tutorial where you do your own makeup and its one-on-one with you and the audience💜
Where did you get those big heeled shoes from?
''TRENDY"
Finally shes back! I missed u😁
this is great but i miss those makeup tutorials!
OMG I love patternator! I've made tons of wallpapers with BTS members on them lol #ARMY
I think I got too old for this.
Use a stipple sponge for freckles. Looks WAY more realistic
i like the apps you featured. and i agree I'm happy to see the chunky heels back ;)
I LOVEEEED THIS SOOO MUCH ❤️
Did she and dom break up? or they are still together?
No no no no let the bucket hats die
It's amazing, Michelle
2:07 interesting trousers
I love this series ❤
Whelp.....bout to download happify
"She is channeling My Little Pony" 😂
You're awesome to say "thumbs down if you're not digging it so much"
Yeeeeeeeesss headspace !!!
YASS SIENNA!!!!
Loving these trend report videos!! I've seen the faux freckles trend for a long time now and am dying to try it out 😊💖
All those fashion trends look awful!
I love Michelle but she hasn't done much but trend report and pillow talk lately.. I love trend report (not so much pillow talk) but maybe a little variety:)
Your trend reports are amazing xx 💞💕
I honestly love this series so much, I just wish u uploaded them more often, that'd be awesome!!!!
Gram gallery Wengie! xD
trend report is my favourite michelle phan series of videos! what is everyone elses favourite video/s? :)
So is there any way to be featured as an instagram account? 
I have recently started posting very regularly, on average an absolute minimum of one picture a day, usually around 3, all being creative makeup looks or paintings(I am getting into fanart a bit more, but I do a lot of different styles depending on what inspires me most that day)
I am also open to collabs or something similar with other smaller IGers :D 
I have just never really taken the time to figure out IG, but I find it so much fun to see so many creative people and be inspired by them. It's amazing and even the feedback a small account like mine gets really boost my self confidence.
When i hear word "grill" i always think about CL ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ
I don't really watch Michelles videos, but i saw the thumbnail and was like "is that Sienna?" So I clicked on the video.
I'm definitely subbing to ipsy
my freckles are in right now? o.O
DUDE I REMEMBER THAT HOT CHOCOLATE VID
This is a little out of the topic, but can you make Rhea's hairstyle of the last chapter? :3 I love it so much!
@thanyafox, you should follow her
You should feature the ig artist : Boldo777 on your gram gallery he's an amazing artist
Sorry but undercuts have been happening in the black community for years now! It's just that yall are "catching on/stealing"
Michelle, what is your musical.ly? I want to follow you!😘💕✨🌙🌸
I like the Lips Sync App Musical.Ly So Much Too! its really fun to play it with your friends!
Btw I Think @killllel14 is a quit good instagram creator tbh he dun really hav to much posts but i thinks his post are awesome pretty decorated :D
Is it me or did you delete your alter ego makeup look?❤️❤️
Michelle do you ship phan??
Looks like that thing about cultural appropriation only happens in America. In Europe, we usually like to share cultures and we don't just "appropiate", we respect and we use it, I've never been told by any black person or friend that I can't wear cornrows (in case you don't know, white people can have thick and curly hair, so yeah, that hairstyle helps me a lot).
im disappointed michelle...where's the dark-skinned girl love? where's the michelle we love with the personal tutorials?..
I'd like to see more makeup videos, I mean that's what I subscribed for
Seriously though where can I get those chunky heals at! I'm in love!!!
Love this video Michelle - you're an inspiration
Are you kidding me? I have freckles all over my face which is so ugly, but atleast it's a bit unique. Now people can have GOOD looking freckles and I'm stuck with a face full of them :(
Gram Gallery suggestions: @jeijeiworld @lifeofbart
grills are coming back. oh lord...
Yes @evaafernandez she so cute and cool i adore her
Gram gallery! He is a photographer for underground subway trains. He's a fierce daring and fearless photographer. @61k2ps
Grills are cultural appropriation.
Upload more😊
Mish can you do a routine video (night/morning) like the one made by Trisha Paytas/Andreas Choice etc?  Pleaseeeeeee!🙏
Love you from Malaysia 😘✌
Love this segment 💕
Pretty soon we'll all look like people from the Capitol
I don't think we should be calling freckles and grills trends just because white media thinks they're "cute"... Just saying.
what's your musically???
@zakbeau
Please do a bridal make up tutorial
@arielaartistry on instagram for Glam Gallery ! she's awesome
who will draw freckles on their face? n glitter? m sorry is this sarcasm?? atleast hold a board in the hand white says "SARCASM" on it..  or m in some alternate world where it is weird..

I remember that chocolate video! I never tried it but was totally intrigued 😜
i just love how original your videos are
I like the glitter freckles :)
YAZZ SIENNA
Musical.ly????
This is really useful. Thanks Michelle!! ☺

I dunno why but ur voicr in every video is so relaxing! Like you speak softly and it makes me asleep!
Hey Mish, I really wanted to say that i love your videos a lot recently(not that i used to hate them tho cuz ur so creative) These lifestyle vids and Pillow talk has helped me so much.Oh and Mish Helios:Femina is amazing, the art and the way you promote feminism and that part which i quote "If you kill one you kill all but if you save one you save all"(or something in that genre) which is found in the quran I think is absolutley wonderful. You are doing such an amazing job Michelle and i love you so much for that. The art and concept of Helios:Femina is just out of this world ;) Keep it up Mish ily and will always support.
Siennnnnnaaa s2
Michelle you should try NuSkins if you're two on one its protects your beautiful skins and the product in no chemical  i use it and it works you if you do try it out please tell me

Be careful on the highlighting and Contour. When you take off your make-up, it is very deceitful. #StopLieing
Love your trendy report, especially the tech trend.  Keep up the great work!!!
leg contour? give me a damn break...
Your videos are beautiful
كونتور الفخذ  مررره خقه 
دايما نشوف كونتور الصدر و بقية الجسم  بس الفخذ طريقته جذابه مره ..
بس صعب بمجتمعنا ما تقدري تلبسي لبس فوق الركبة .

OMG THE 2010 THROWBACK!
i've been doing glitter freckles and I had no idea it was a trend! I never saw anyone with them....I feel hipster
we really need new trends every month?
we end up like that??
humanity can stand in the same direction just for two seconds???

I don t think that earth's resources grown as fast as our minds change...
What was the color correcting palate you used in the video?
I definitely have enough natural freckles to spare the trend...lol
Where are the chunky lace up heals from ?
i liked this video but if you are not about to tell me that GRILLS originated from Tokyo
I wanted to see your beautiful face in the video michelleee 😞😞oh by the way I had this project on English and it was about writing for someone who inspires you and whole second it be besides you?! I love you Michelle ❤️❤️
NOPE to the grills.
Siennaaaa!

Michelle, I really apreciate you, but honestly,  aren't you bored of these pillow talks and trend reports? You are telling me about the make up I've already seen în MAKE UP tutorials
Where you at girl😩😩😩 where's the tutorials and favorite videos
GRAM GALLERY: _danny_zzz
This is my best friend's instgram profile. His posts always have a hidden meaning which i think is really cool. 
I would really appreciate it if you would check out his instagram! :) ❤️
It reminds me of the looks that the Capitol in Hunger Games has xD
I love musical.ly I am on it 24/7
Does anybody else think that the girl with the grill looked like Zico at that part?😂 loved the video btw!
If you want to show off your grill just make Leo's face in The Revenant
I think the headspace is app got deleted :(
But I think that musically is dying down now...
@cloud_shit pls

i love her videos so i had subscribed her channel it's fun to do
michelle i really like you but it seems like you've grown not as closes you used to be. you r videos seem more professional and not personal anymore and you have been doing alot of pillow talks and trends which I feel like isn't you. I LOVE YOU thanks

Oh! that's great!!
Gold grills for sure
I just got my first ipsy bag in the Mail!!!!!!!!!! I'm so happy!!
oh my god.. those grills... no.
I know I already said this, but the art work really is amazing. It reminds me of my favorite comic book elf quest. If you've never heard of it  you've got to check it out. I think you would really like it. I just finished the second episode and the angel like being reminds me of the high ones in elf quest. Love it! going back for more.  Thanks for sharing your talent, i'm really impressed so far.
@lasma_st
I miss your make up tutorials :(
When I saw freckles I thought of Leo and suga....

Tara milk tea
Hey Mish, i wanna say thank you for helping. You made me have more selftrust, at first i was a shy person and did'nt talk to anybody, like a Kuudere XD people were also teasing me and it was hard for me to make friends, heck, i was even thinking about commiting suicide... But then when i watched your videos, i got more trust in myself and to never up no matter what and also to be happy of who i am, people were amazed when i changed, and they don't even tease me anymore, i've got to make more friends and it was all because of you. Thank you sooooo much for everything. You're the best woman in the world! I love you! <3
i have musically its awesome realemely is the name its really a awesome app ☺☺☺
I have freckles too...and I really hate them... and now people draw freckles on their faces... And im like: Dafuq? pls dont tell me that: OMG youre so beautiful or.... I love freckles...... thats kinda annoying for persons who have freckles....pls just stop it thank you microphone drop

what color corrector palette is it?
Is this really Michelle Phan video? i don't even see her
love these kind of videos
What about real freckles? Am I cool yet?
One of the girls was wearing Hayley Williams Jacket from the "Still into you" Video of Paramore! Awesome!
You forgot braids. They are becoming super popular, especially in hot weather when you want your long hair to stay in place and not give you too much warmth
where did she get those glasses <3_<3 @ 6:40 ??!
More of these pleaseeeeeee
Cool love this 👍❤️
I can't believe Michelle's almost 30!!
where to find the gliche app
if anyone can find the shoes in 5:31, please please send me a link.

I've been trying to find shoes just like that and I'm still looking. But if anyone finds them, please comment. 

Thanks ❤️
Some of these trends are terrifying
love the jacket!
I love all the videos that you have been putting on your channel Michelle! But I was wondering if you can upload a makeup tutorial? It feels like it's been ages since you last posted a tutorial! But of course, this is your channel and you can post whatever you want.
I LOVE those thick heeled sandles!!! Where are they from?!
Lovely Video, great work Michelle <3 :)
I love the faux freckles too
what is your musical.ly name
I LUV U MICHELLE BUT WHERE'S THE MAKEUP TUTORIALS????! It's like you always upload pillowtalks, trend reports, etc. :'( your makeup tutorials are the BEST!
she is literally the only youtuber that says "Give this video a thumbs up if you like it, thumbs down if your not digging it do much." I love her so much
Goals!
Grills? Really? cough cough cultural appropriation cough cough
feature @gloomybear_art
...I've seen faux freckles since pre-k, but I guess they're on blast now? :/
Guy Tang came in when they were filming
Your voice is magical michalle
Was the ipsy bag for May
You used hot coco powder that has sugar and other ingredients instead of just regular coco powder lol
does anyone have any methods or tips for applying eye makeup for severely hooded eyes? I just have no idea what to do!!!
I really LOVE trend reports 💖
What if you already have freckles
I wonder why u didnt post something on snapchat:'(((
That girl's hair had my jaw dropping. Like, she looks as if she jumped out of a sci-fy fantasy artbook or something like that wow.
What's the color correcting palate called?
Chunky heels... Trend? They never left. But, I don't care for the shoes at 5:28.
all mentioned app is not available in ph 😩
I have freckles and I hate them so much
Does anybody know where those heels are from? I really want them😩
Make more videos please. I love your videos. But I understand that you are busy but don't forget about the YouTube channel +michellephan
Bruuuu... Is she tricking us in saying "faux freckles" fast?? 😳😟
for gram gallery check out the account sam.gamberg - really awesome aesthetically pleasing pics!
At 5:32 I thought White Iverson was playing.
For your next trend report video put the Instagram account @fullscreen
I already have real freckles lol.
Where are the shoes from??? :)
Where are the foils from?
I dont see YOU in YOUR videos anymore
Man I miss her
Ugh, I still miss Michelle Phan! She brings back so many memories, she’s made me sooooo happy when I was sad! I misss herrrrr
bts with dem faux freckles
i love these trend reports!!! there's some bookstagram instagram pages that you would really like mish, if your looking to feature some.
Love your videos! So fun and creative and unique!
So fab!!
Anyone else want the old Michelle back?
Michelle, check out @nadzlustre on Instagram. Her feed is so cool and edgy. :)
Michelle, I am sad to see how far your videos have strayed in capturing and creating the art of makeup. In my opinion this is not what we fell in love with you originally for. I admire how successful you have become, and you've done wonderful things, but these videos seem to be reproductions of the overproduced hauls that cloud the internet. I just think that you are so much better than these videos that toot products, apps, and material items, and I miss being wowed by the sheer ingenuity and artistic talent that used to define your videos.
Loved the trend report!! I clicked on it as soon as I saw Sisi's hair and the words trend report!! Love you Michelle!!
whats the color correcting pallete she had
where did you get those shoes from?
Is she still together with dominic ?
Hey Mish 💎
I wasmwondering...I dont really get the content of helios femina. The illustrations are justt. .. AMAZBALLS. but I just dont get the content you are giving to us.
Love the apps. Thanks!
Nice acting in the Matt Damon charity ad... how much to hire you?
So in this chanel i actually learned something.Thanks michelle
YAAASSSSSS FINALYYYYYYYY I HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT LINE WEBTOON FOR FO-EVAAAHHH
where can i get those glasses
Am I the only one who said faux freckles 5 times?!
trend report is the best
SIENNA BABY DARLING
Mis your makeup tutorials!
those jeans are a bit tired ripped
Sienna!
I'm not sure if I'm imagining things, but Michelle sounds so melancholy and unmotivated these days. I really hope I'm wrong...but if I'm not, then cheer up Mish! We love you! Make videos where we can see you! I miss you so much
I havent been here in a while, is she still dating Dom?
That Asian girl was so cringe worthy omg
IG @hellobeenj :) Give me some love! <3
I read webtoons and found hers to be boring. However, the graphics are simple an amazing work of art. But the story... Just.. Meh, in my opinion.
😍
Okay when there are a billion holes in your "jeans" along with 3/4 of the leg missing, I don't think you can call it "jeans"
Oh this is cool
Michelle's clothing sense slays me🔪🔪👏🏻!!! I would die if she ever came out with a clothing line!
You should try Video Selfie App!!! Perfect for video editing on you smartphone!! I think you would like it Mish! So cool if you are on the go or if you are a creator who is starting and you dont have or cant afford a nice camera and editing programs.
how cute!!!!
how cute!!!!
WHO ARE THE GIRLS IN THIS VIDEO AND WHERE ARE YOU? I MISS YOUR FACE
I'm interested in apps :)
siennaaaa
I LOVE trend reports
I can't find gliche in the app store :/
Your channel make me want to rage out and murder.
The Asian girl is so pretty and adorable
GRILLZ have ALWAYS been popular Down South. This is not a new trend from Asia :/
I need to know where is this multicolored leather jacket from !!!!!
how do you make the glitter freckles stay on your skin???
Michelle copied IAMKARENO with the freckles lmao
i LOVE those thick heeled shoes!! Where can i get them O.O
I honestly wish that Trend Reports were their own TV show!
@aliencreature ig is breathtaking
i missed old videos
I NEED THESE JEANS SO BAD !!!
I find it crazy how freckles are a trend now because I have natural freckles so I never thought they were a big deal lol
I miss the makeup tutorials
where can you get your clour corrector palette？
Freckles are from and for redheads, stop copying us
I miss you michelle 😢
are there any other vids like this on YouTube
I need those chunky heels in my life. Anybody know where I can get them?
The faux freckles are really cute!
where do you get those jeans? the ones in minute 2:00
I LOVE your trend reports! They are so well made. Can't wait to share some of those ads with my friends!
❤❤❤
They've been doing those undercut design things in Harajuku forever. It seems like a lot of trends from there slowly make their way to the west which is kinda cool!
trend reports are my favvvv
Am I the only one who can't find the GLICHE app?
My favourite gram gallery is always this new artist elsnaps_ ! OCD people will feel good after scrolling thru haha !
michelle i wish you would make videos narrating your graphic novel/comic your voice is so calming. I would love to be read by you.. in a non creepy way. :)
these trend reports are so cool and helpful. love it.
it shouldn't be a culture acceptance it hurt to the people who created and not fair but it okay to take it make it as a trend 
WRONG MY CULTURE ISNT A TREND BUT YOU GUYS WONT SAY ANYTHING BUT JUST THE FRECKLES 
MY CULTURE ISN'T A TREND BUT I GET TO CALLED UGLY AND GHETTO EVERYTIME
@elliotweaverr
Ace Junior brought me here
What glitter foil is that?
For a second there, i thought it said glitter faces.
i can't find your webtoon
look at @muhammedsalah_
Again... Its free.
What is your musically account
Ugh stupid videos 
Can I see makeup tutorial Idc about this
love chunky heels!
Anyone know where I could get that multi-colored jacket at? I need it :O
can you please do the power of makeup?
Who would ever give one of her videos a thumbs down?!
This generation looks like we stepped out of the capital from the hunger games
I love fun freckles!
good job #michelle phan
Does anyone know where are the black heels from ? I love them ! 😍
for feature recommendations i recommend essynoir and terrytatata
I LOVE THE EDITING STYLE OF THE TREND REPORTS!!
Is it only me or did she not list where the glitter is from? I think it's so cute!
This is what I love about her. She is okay with dislikes and doesn't try to force likes out of us like other youtubers. She's honest.
Wow thanks
and nadine lustre
Isn't the place at 06:29 the same from Song of style's video on how to take instargram photos?
Michelle, I gotta recommend you to bryanadamc, he has the gram gallery and photography!
What are the shoes called?!?!
Hi michelle! I would like to work in your company or just be a model just like them in your videos pls ❤️
excited for my ipsy bag
seriously, a grill? did you really think a grill would be a good idea to label as a trend and show off in your video.
Feature fetching_tigerss
Remember her barbie tutorial, and you know, all her other makeup tutorials. And when she was in them mostly. Yea i miss that.
That throwbackkk
body contouring, way to much make up all over my skin... and all those chemicals on your body now as well
Did not know Suzanne Collins could foresee the future
Where is your make up tutorial video?
I love your trend reports!!(:
the gold thing in the teeeth was seriously orrible!
HER SELFIE STICK IS FROM THE 99 c STORE I HAVE IT
Love the glitter freckles! I have rosacea and just use a matt pale green cheap drugstore eyeshadow SPARINGLY as you say,under my base...
Those jeans are super distressed
Not that I don't love you Michelle but you should go back to the old videos.
love it!
don't know what to say.. i'm all in for being open, playing around with makeup, hair, colors etc... but this? this is a bit too much, i think. that first futurist haircut, "pony-like", definitely looks amazing, but, come on, how many people actually wear that? and the glitter freckles make that girl look weird and artificial. the metal accessories are an interesting touch, i'm not sure how wearable they are on a day to day basis, for simply going out or at the beach etc. thumbs up for the makeup, outfits, dark roots balayage, and the happify app, but then again: make yourself happy by going out more, taking a trip somewhere close to nature, reading smth, not always spending time with your phone. as for the contouring the legs, you can also get a light, healthy tan, then moisturize well or apply a lotion that is a bit oily, then you don't have to worry about contouring "melting" or coming off if it's too hot outside!

hope i didn't offend anyone! i love Michelle phan, this was just an opinion :)
Hat Trend... Hate it!
since when is mental health a trend
sienna!!!!!!!
those freckle and grills is hideous.the rest is fine,but my favorite is the hair
Really miss your makeup tutorials
Beautiful
I love your trend videos!
Some of these trends are ridiculous
You have the most unfortunate last name. I bet you hear "PHAN IS REAL! PHANFICTION! PHANDOM!" All the time.... so sorry girl.
feature anntheginger at your gram gallery!
Hey Mish, could you do a faux freckle tutorial using different methods and advice on how dark a colour to use?
me gusta el pan
michelle, what happened to your 'makeup tutorial' videos? i really miss them :( pls upload a makeup tutorial soon!
I want a girl like you. But it'll never happen:(
I really wanna know what that color correcting palette is Q~Q. I always have a hard time finding those color correcting colors all in one palette
Bucket hats already came and went..
Glitter freckles are not trendy........ Lol
i wanna be one of those girls inside!!!
contouring legs? damn smh, why don't people make real changes that would benefit them in the long run?
to *
Awesome video - want to collabe
Dang, that girl's face at 4:03 😳 cringey!
As someone who was born with freckles, I'm kinda sad to see people with such clear and beautiful skin try and recreate them for themselves :( But to each their own I guess x.x
ure  tred reports are my favs
Where did you get those shoes😫😫 I love them😍😫
I really love the trend reports but i miss the make up tutorials
www.instagram.com/s_o_a_p_p_o_r_n
Hi! Anyone know what's the brand of the colour correcting palette in this video? Thanks!
anyone know where to find the gliche app? thank you :)
I know that you are a big advocate for peace and unity but I would really want to see a response to freelee the banana girl from you. In my eyes she seems to be bullying girls into a lifestyle that might not be for everyone. I feel like your opinion on it would be very bold.
Mark David (deathbefore.decaf) has a cool instagram feed!!!
i really love the ripped jeans at 1:50, they look so cool😄
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone know where are the black heels from ? I love them ! 😍
I hate the grills
I wish you featured people on instagram that don't already have thousands of followers.
Does anyone else miss her tutorials?
I love these videos
those trends are becoming weirder and weirder with each video....
+Kris A idk why you're so butthurt about grills. Sure rappers wore them, but that doesn't make it a trend. Michelle said in Tokyo they started to wear grills as a trend. A trend in this context is something you wear in your everyday life whether famous, a rapper, or an average joe. So your point is irrelevant.
love these trends!! do you think foil freckles would look good on me Mish??
So are the mini products in this months Ipsy? Sorry did I miss Michelle say that?
Today is my birthday 😄
I love these videos!
The girl doing the freckles was so adorable
😍😍😍
The colourful leather jacket is just like aria from pll where is wore it:)
I thinks it's a waste of time and money doing glitter roots. It's messy and seems like it would be. a pan to wash out😩
i love headspace, they have the cutest videos and the voice is so super calming. the only downside is the cost. it costs so much compared to any other app i just keep repeating my first few sessions again and again :<
didn't love the style of this vid compared to other trend reports
this video was made over a month ago and has only broken 650k views with 8m subs :(
5:01 WTF that face she's making?
Those cornrows though
I hate how a lot of these apps aren't for Android! But well, I guess that they will release it for Android in a future.
What's the brand of the color correcting pallet ??
you know who actually started the custm grills? Rappers.
what software she use to edit the videos?
1:59 it is used in all music videos :)
you're a bae
Here are two cool instagram accounts I have been checking out: @thinker.dreamer.coffee @mo.concept . Hope you like them too.
Michelle are you still with dom
I can't find the app a colour story in my Samsung! pls help
Do you have any good recommendations for anti aging creams? I may be really young but I'm paranoid about wrinkles I know I will get them eventually but I would love to keep them away as long as possible!!
Oh I liked those shoes.... anyone know where I can get ones like them?  (UK)
Where are those heeled laced up shoes from?
Remember when Michelle was youtube famous.? Now there are other youtubers.. 😂👌 lol no hate but ya
Phan
BTW MORE MAKEUP TUTORIALS PLZZZZZZ
I love trend reports!!
Hey Mich, may i know the brand for the color correcting makeup? Thank u, love u
faux freckles ._. one day the actual makeup-less look will become trendy
I just miss her makeup tutorials
These trends are so outdated
I can't find the gliche app...
body contour? smh.
Michelle, I checked out the webcomic and it is A-MAZING! the art is breathtaking and the story is complexly beautiful! Keep on writing, girl!
Miss her face, her  tutorials :/
i have always wanted freckles so bad!!!
does anyone know where those big heeled shoes are from?
I'm really glad she said musically because I really want everyone to know how awesome the app is. I've been doing videos for a while now and I also recommend the app. it's really fun and some people make awesome videos.
sofia andres please
It is always so interesting and entertaining to watch your trend reports! Can't wait to see more episodes!
Whenever I see something disgusting, sad, stressful or frustratingly stupid that makes me want to just wash my brain with bleach I just watch your videos, because they're so well put together and so aesthetically pleasing it cleanses my eyes
cringe when i look the asian girl show the grills (im asian dont worry im not racist)
I love my real freckles. people used to make fun of them when I was younger but now people are trying to recreate them and I'm like lol don't have too
I don't honestly see what so trendy about grills it looks ugly
Who are all of the people in her video
+Michelle Phan  the link that you have leave in the discription for the metalic fangs doesn't work ,how can i search for it on etsy or other places ??? BTW your videos are cool
It's interesting how many makeup trends now are tricks that drag queens have been using for years such as contouring/body contouring and color correcting. Older trends too such as baking and the "Instagram eyebrow" have all been used by the drag community for a long time. I wonder what drag trick is gonna become a "trend" next
Where are those black heels from?😭
I can't find gliche in appstore
i wish she would do different levels of ipsy bags....i want more products. Like a 20 dollar bag then a 30 dollar bag with bigger sizes and more questions to better suit the more amount of product.
I don't want to be a hater but I miss Michelle Phan 's old videos
I cant vind the app gliche on the app store??
glitter freckles are for like late night party gals
Where are the chunky heels that you showed from??
u could have added the colour changing nail polish trend too
I have sooo many freckles and I don't know why people like to draw them...they not very likeable😕I don't like them
You should feature @ gabsgetgnarly on instagram!
Where are those laced black chunky heeled shoes from!?
I can hear her saliva
i like how how she says you can thumb up or thumb down. most people would would just say rhumb up thumb up
Where is the color correcting pallet from?
Why are some apps not available for android😠
pppplllsss do more trend
another trend would be all those dance videos floating around with the younger generations
Trend reports are totally awesome
what shoes are those???
when is the next trend report
This Video Was uploaded on my Bday!! And i did Not know!
omg love trend report!!!:)
wow grills and bucket hats are making a comeback?
Luv trend report!!!!!
#BringBackMichelle
I love these trend reports.
I love her I wanna be just like her
I like that video
Why don't you make makeup videos anymore and post more??
I love how she doesn't just say "give me a thumbs up if you like it," she wants your honest opinion and asks you to give it a thumbs down if you didn't like it too much. Good for you,Michelle😊😘
Can you use another term instead of fair skin? not everyone has that skin tone and calling it fair sends unintentional message that darker skin folks are not considered fairest of the fair.
the teeth trend or whatsoever it was it was awful especially it didn't suit that girl
i dont like the last two trend reports. I dont like the music, the "ambient"... i dont know, but first trend reports are diferent
Me and my friends really want ipsy but it's not in Australia.. When will it come to Australia??
I am pretty sure if I wear glitter freckles my boyfriend would never want to stand near me... Just saying
It kind of cracks me up that bucket hats are back. All I can think of is how hideous they were once they went out of style when I was a kid. 😂
Ugh grills are so disgusting to me really. That part of the video made me exit the video quickly.
I love trend report!!!! 😍
all these trends are like from 2014 w the grills  n bucket hat
Mooore trend report!!!!
What type of that heeled shoes and where i can find it?
I'm so sorry, mIchelle, these trends are freakin ridiculous... plz don't get involved. faux sparkle freckle??? and body countoring taken seriously??
Where can I find those chunky heels?!??
Where are the black thick heeled shoes from? :)
Who cringed when the girl put the highlight on her neck ? Just me ? Ye okay bye...
The grill and freckle glitter are terrifying...
Does anyone know, where the shoes are from? the ones she mentiones and shows with the thick heel?
Please do some makeup tutorials Michelle, it has been a looooooooong while =) . I'd love to see some pretty summer-inspiration makeup. Love you xo
Wait so I've spent my whole life trying to hide my freckles, literally refusing short sleeves even in the heat of summer, and now it's a "trend"?!?!? So you can just wash it off when the ridiculing starts back up? Screw that.
I get it Michelle has people working for her.. But it seems like she doesn't care about her channel anymore it doesn't feel personal and quite bland idk
These aren't even trendy.
My Musically is @Raei493
I still love Michele phan, but after she got famous and started her new company, she doesn't post much videos on YouTube. I really miss her old YouTube channel where she show how she does her makeup. 😔😔
I LOVEEE TREND REPORT!
The fashion and makeup trends in this video has been trending in Asian for years now. And it's actually starting to be past trends this year.
The fashion and makeup trends in this video has been trending in Asian for years now. And it's actually starting to be past trends this year.
I wish ipsy sold to Aus :((((
I think the glitter freckles are funny! And the geometric hair is unique but beautiful, like it pays homage to this cartoonish, outer space style.
I'm actually pretty pissed about the freckles thing, I have had freckles my entire life and have even tried bleaching them out which can cause skin damage, AND NOW it's a freaking fashion trend... -_-
This is Michelle Phan's channel without Michelle Phan. I love her voice, but it's not enough by just doing voiceover with her videos featuring other girls. Videos with the real Michelle Phan please.
Love the glitter freckles
Does anyone know what App Michelle uses to get her pink tinges in her Instagram photos?? I downloaded a color story and maybe I didn't know how to use it but that wasn't what I was looking for
the worst trend report :( :O ... too many neglect details I just think you have much better videos
would love to see a makeup tutorial Mish! these trend reports are great but for the majority of us we want to see makeup tutorials. i miss the Youtube part
EyeEm is trending right now too. It's a photography app. It can help with getting your photos noticed by bid brands and it haves a really good photo editing filters.
Wow... I got none of these items in my ipsy bag except for the starlooks cream shadow... Disappointed
Where can i get those shoes?
I didn't like faux freckles they look ...... WEIRD
Miss you Michelle
How come you don't upload makeup tutorials anymore?
Your ad for Ipsy has been all over my internet.... I don't even wear makeup.
I miss that this chanel only consists of makeup tutorials. ...... wtf
what happend with her? where is the old michelle ?
she said a trend in tokyo she didn't said the trend started in tokyo u guys are really fast offended
What's the color correcting palette she featured?
omg I love my little pony 😀😝😄😃😎
check out misterode
I really hate when people put freckles on themselves for a statement, cause I have them all over my body and I hate them! But I mean, I'm not gonna judge someone who does
I'm so happy you started this series of Trend Report! No one has ever put up monthly updates and summarize it as simple as how you do it. I used to always flip magazines but full time school and 2 jobs really put me on hold with what's up to date lately... Pretty sad because before I had so much time on my hand but now I barely can keep updates on my social media... Love you Mish <3
NEOLUTION. GASP
AW THE 2010 CHOCOLATE BRONZER VIDEO😭😭I was in 4TH GRADE when it came out and I remember watching it and trying to do it even though I wasn't allowed to wear makeup. I'm in 11th now and honestly I'm so into makeup and it's all thanks to Michelle, I used to watch her videos for hours since 2nd grade! She taught me so much and without her I'd be the kind of girl who is clueless with makeup 💙
is there something wrong with you doing a video of how all young women can look beautiful for what they have with out telling then about looking fake ??
ugh grills are for black poor rappers
wow
THOSE FRECKLES DONT LOOK REAL, and, I'm going to be honest, i hate the rianbow freckles trend.
Anyone know where she got those boots from at 5:27
I loveee chocolate Makeup..
+Michelle Phan I love reading  your webcomic Helios: Femina! Is very good!
Why is that Gliche app is not showing in my app store (I have a Iphone 5s)? I really want to install that, looks fun. Please someone tell me
Really missing the makeup tutorials! It seems like you're just mainly doing trend reports and pillow talk!
i feel so lost i want to do something for humanity but every time i try i fall motivation is hard to attain and  i lost faith in myself i keep thinking Im useless but i need to remember Im humen i ,no we are capable of many things cause god gave us intelligence not to waste it but to use it and we must work together to spread a message learn and work hard to bring us back we are more then 7 billion ppl on the planet one life makes a difference hashtag work for a cause
In your next trend report can your suggest good font apps 💖
The glitter freckles are awkward lol, will anyone wear that out? :/
cool vid
You dont do makeup videos anymore ): 
pls look at @jenniferbin on ig. she has the coolest pictures of architecture in Shanghai- a very minimalist aesthetic. check her out!
Can you make more makeup videos??? Like for people who can't afford more than dollar store makeup??
❤️💛💚💙💜youtube friends anyone??🍉🌙
im new to youtube 😝🤘
who else wants to see more of michelle instead of the models? cmon minchelle we love YOU!!! voice overs are great but the older trend reports featuring you were better.
I have freckles naturally and I hate them... Why would anyone paint them on?
"Hey I don't have time for YouTube, so let me get people to physically be in my videos and I'll just do voiceovers. You guys obviously don't like my newer content nearly as much but I can keep doing it anyway because you all feel like you need to stay subscribed to me"
Freckles are trendy? My freckles are hated and people always tell me to wipe them off! I guess they didn't get the news :/
SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE TO GET ONE OF THOSE COLOUR CORRECTING THINGYS FOR CHEAP BC MY ROSACEA IS HORRIBLE
todays my mums birthday
The Happify app sounds super interesting. Will check it out right away :D
were does GUY TANG live????? my name is yusra my mum is mariyum and she whant's to get her hair colored from him😊😊😊😊😊😊
Reply if you watching in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019,2020,2021.
I have Alot of freckles.
Where has she been dude it is like shes been missing for a while
I couldn't find helios:femina in web toon
Did she lost subs? The last time i checked it was 9M
I love what you did with this trend report, Michelle. You have a pretty face, but I thought this was better trend report in my opinion. I hope you do this more often, it makes me more attracted to the product. It's like a commercial, but alluring!
Can anyone tell me where those chunky black heels are from?
That girl with freckles and grill doesn't look trendy, she looks like she is trying way too hard....that is ridiculously stupid-_-
the girl with the blonde buns is in a video for make up newbs
Anyone know what lashes the girl with the glitter freckles was wearing?
5:15-5:22 such a weird trend and ı got afraid of her
Where are the black thick heeled shoes from?!
What's next? Galaxy Eyebrows?
Look at these strange ripped jeans in 02:07 😕
The hair part of this video was cool...unfortunately I'm feeling a bit disappointed with how crazy people are getting to create or have a certain image....why put glitter on your face? you're not 13...I guess for some occasions it could be fun but come on..and what's up with the grills? To make matters worse people are always saying be happy with the way you look yet they are trying to change everything about their body..contouring their neck, their collarbone, thighs, boobs, and even abs, legs and feet....who even has that kind of time?! Why are people doing this?
She sounded really unhappy in this video, like it's a chore not a passion anymore.
Seriously, I really don't care about trends reports, I just wanna know how to put makeup on. 
So when people naturally have freckles they are called 'ugly', but creating the illusion of freckles using makeup is a trend? cool.
Y
Grills are kinda gross I mean no
where did you get the chocolate bar pallet
is it me or michelle is losing viewers? :c she used to get millions and now her last vídeos dont even hit the million.
Does anyone know where you can find the rainbow jacket that the girl with the grills is wearing?
Black people been getting undercuts
Just an FYI: Places where the sun hits your face more is where you are least likely to get freckles
Too Faced had their chocolate/Cocoa bronzer or pressed powder ever since they started the brand... I remember my first one back in 2008 or what. That's long before the first youtube beauty channel ever. Not surprised they came up with these chocolate bar palettes at all. It's their branding.
Michelle where are you? I don't like these basic girls. I hope they're not going to be replacing you.
am I the only one who thinks that the girl at 2:27 looks like the one from the music video from jet black heart by 5sos? 5sos fam whre are you? ♡♡♡♡
This colorfull hair is ridiculous
Almost everyone's foux freak less look horrible! OMG so unnatural even when you try and make it look that way! Glam and gore slays that shit 10x better than this girl
Hi!! I'm a 15 year old and i upload comedy, advice and more videos coming soon!! My goal is to get 9000 subscribers please help me out, thanks guys! :)
i honestly think that michelle needs a second channel where she does trend reports & pillow talks (i kinda wish she'd stop this series bc i watched a few & they're pretty boring & pointless, not a  bit motivational) so she can do makeup looks on this one!
kinda on the fence of being happy and pissed off about the faux freckles trend. I've had freckles for my entire life, been made fun of for having "dirty looking skin" this trend pops up, everyone loves my freckles. I know that when the trend goes away, everyone will make fun of them again. same thing goes for cultural appropriation, but I could just be over exaggerating.
The freckles supossed to be well blended in order 2look good and realistic
5:21 cringy sry
😜😜😜😜😝😝😝😝😝😝😚😚😚😚😚😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😌😌😌😌😌😄😄😄😅😅😅😃😃
I think everything in this video is interesting but I do  not understand why wearing grills is attractive and why wearing glitter freckels are as well. I have real freckels all over my face and I don't think thos r needed. love you michelle... I want to recommend a show for you to watch it is called the miraculous lady bug. it is a French show but there is an English version. The original version is French but it has the subtitles. It is a story that has cute  romace and humor and action. to me it is like a French anime. :)
Glitter freckles make you look like a blown out birthday cake and why do people with freckles try to hide their freckles and why do people with no freckles draw freckles lol
I dont wanna sound like hater...but why the girls in the vid didnt have plugged eyebrows? is it really a thing to have messy eyebrows filled with browshadows? for me it is kinde ewww... so :/ I am just curious because this is not the first time I have seen it :)
I have a face and body full of freckles that I get made fun of for
Its kinda sad how like in her last few vids shes not showing her face and i was so confused why but now it makes sense
Freckles are from and for redheads, stop copying us
What has her channel become l i kow she change like everyone change but I thought she does makeup tutorial
I love these! Please do more!✌🏻️✨
great video!!! <3
she dosen't show her face 😭😭😳😳
This was a good episode!
Michelle you are an inspiration to smaller YouTubers like myself, thank you for everything. ♥

Any smaller youtubers want to help each other out? ♥ ♥ ♥
each time someone complains about cultural apropriation, my insides rot a little faster. please pray for a cure. bless
am I the only one who felt uncomfortable watching that asian girl? don't mean to be rude or something......
Undercut???? Really those are just parts. People and these "trends" that people of color have been doing for years and years but that doesn't really matter.
Cultural appropriation is a lot like turning an art project in, getting a big, fat, red "F" on it, and then someone else turning in the SAME art project and getting an "A" on it, with the teacher PRAISING that student for their creativity. 
Anybody would be pissed off about that, so don't EVEN with the whole "afgoigafgrjgo EVERYBODY'S OFFENDED" bull crap. You would be offended too. Any reasonable person would.
The girl in the pastel colored jacket looks so irritating! 
omg I hate her 'look'. I hate the hair the brows the eye shadow het outfit and the ugly freckles.
Definitely loving the 90s and black inspired culture that's trending worldwide. It just makes my life easier cause I have most of the material 💖 Love your trend videos 😍
I always look forward to these videos 😝🤘🏼
Michelle's videos are so useful and inspiring!
Remember when Michelle tried the chocolate soleil bronzer because she said it smelled like chocolate 😂💖 fav moment ever
yay! I love trend reports! :D
I am LIVING for the undercuts 😍😍 and I'm loving the idea of different colors with it!
Why don't you do makeup tutorials anymore 😭😭
Again? Please!!!!!! :( you are so boring now :c
This is my favorite series. Also you should feature @sydneystclare she's a super talented artist.
Amazing vid really inspirative i love you
you're my nr1 inspiration !
does anyone know where those chunky heeled shoes are from?? I'm in love !!!
That grills Etsy link doesn't work. 😢
@commoncomfort :)
people with freckles try to cover them, whereas those without, draw them on :) i love both natural and drawn ones too!
I can't find GLICHE app on App Store, why? 😰
I love freckles, since i don't have them I draw them on all of my characters
The hair is very beautiful I love it
her voice is so calming!!
i am always loving trend reports 👍🏻
Scented makeup yasssssssss......Michelle slayyyyyyy ❤❤
I love how you can see the imperfections in the skin during this video. It's very natural looking and you can clearly see the makeup on the skin, a lot of people will blur out any imperfections now a days with lighting and photoshop
I love this trend reports like soo much. ❤️
I loooove trend report. Keep doing it pls!❤️
Your videos calm me down, you have such a soothing voice. Thank you for inspiring me and for just helping me clean my head and improve my self-esteem!! ILY Mish! <3

I have those shoes, there from the coachella collection at h&m
lol all the fashion trends, apart from the grills, have been a thing in the UK for a coup;e of years and if anything is already going out of fashion . US is always 5 years behind all major fashion trends in Europe.

Omg never been this early! I love you Mish! Kisses from Brazil!

This video was so helpful!🎀
John Spanakos is from Greece?
I like the colored hair and cuts SO MUCH! Actually been wanting to do that for years but since I'm only 15 and my parents don't like being out of the norm and drawing attention, I gotta wait
where do i get those shoes??
I'm so insecure about my freckles and I don't really have alot but I hate them so much
the scented makeup isn't really a trend. it's a thing one makeup brand called too faced does.
don't know why but in the end you seem a little sad or disappointed. I hope you're doing well girl ✌
Can you do some more tutorials or shorter videos please. I have a really short attention span which is a shame as I do like your videos.
how come she hasn't have 9283777838292929928474777483829919292938484 subscribers

@panachedecorshoppe2016
can you PLEASE stop putting makeup products in the ipsy bags that use animal testing???? it's sooo wrong that you're supporting companies that torture animals
I love you Michelle, you inspire me so much!
haha first
Love you so much michelle
too cute girllll
Yasssss
😍
WHAT IF YOU'RE FREAKING ASIAN AND CAN'T HELP BUT TO EAT RICE BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR SOUL
Why are the people with nice skin asking advice questions?😒
why some people always sleep late at night then always drinking liquor but their skin is so smooth and clear af. WHYYYYYYY?????
He can treat my acne any day hehe
He's so cute... sitting like that, cross legged with those socks ... pillow talking. Lol
Is anyone actually listening to the Information or is everyone staring at that dermatologist?😂
I would get acne just to go to this doctor
I swear to god everyone in the comment section just be thirstin' over the dermatologist 😂😂😂
I'm sorry did he say a hottatologist?? Cause that's what I heard...

I'll walk  myself out
I'm glad she's successful. But I wish she was still doing the fun inspired make-up. that's really the whole reason I started watching her.
it would be terrible if he was my doctor....i'd be so awkward and blush the whole time because he is just so handsome!
The truth is that acne appears  from having low zinc in the body. Normally dermatologists sell you stuff but this guy is cool. I started adding raw cacao powder into my smoothies as it has a lot of zinc and my acne disappeared quickly and I use raw cacao everyday so now I am spot free. 😊😊😊
if chocolate caused acne I would have the worst skin in America lol
Gosh his voice was so soothing
I stopped drinking milk and eating dairy products. My skin has never been better!
wasn't the last girl question about facial brushes like Clarisonic? why did Michelle talk about liquid foundation? -_-
today, its been 23 years since Michelle last posted a makeup tutorial..
he's hella freaking fine
I just think it's funny but cute how he doesn't have shoes on 😂
goes to buy spearmint tea
How about cultured milk products like Yakult, does it cause breakouts/acne?
MICHELLE, PLEASE ALSO DO A PILLOW TALK ON HAIR FALL, DANDRUFF. THANKYOU
The "dreamer" led light looks amazing :<
practice good skincare is not enough. You think ppl with real acne problem don't wash their face or have good diet? believe me people with real acne problem tried EVERYTHING already
but this is aesthetically pleasing
You know what I love about Michelle? The fact that , despite her incredibly successful business and busy schedule, she still has the time to create beautiful videos for her YouTube channel . Not only that, but each video is personal and centred around the viewer and their needs . This video is a perfect example of that , Michelle clearly doesn't have acne and probably doesn't need this advice . But many of us do , and so she made this video . It makes me sad to see such a hard working , caring and inspirational individual get so much hate for so many things . Thank you Michelle , never stop doing what you do. xx {^•^}
does anyone know how to help skin that is both dry and breaking out at the same time?
It's so cute how he sits cross legged too 😂 but thank god for this video! My face has been breaking out like CRAZY lately.
Take a shot each time "It boils down to" is said 😁
Coconut oil helped me and also birth control pills
I know im not stupid...but damn there are a BUNCH of words here that makes me feel so stupid.
thank you Michelle Phan for Pillow Talk
Damn son , first time I've wished my skin wasn't clear
What if you drink lactose free organic milk? (Horizon Farms)
Michelle if you can can you bring in a dermatologist that specializes in dry skin. i have eczema and it's killing me and i cant afford a dermatologist. thank you Michelle!! ❤❤✨✨
Did I only notice that she said "best of luck" instead of "good luck" ? 😅
love it :D how do you do your hair like that? :)
Hush + Dotti. Best acne cleansing balm ever. Non-comedogenic too.
he can be my doctor any day 😍😂
Aww I wanted to try out the curiology but living in the UK
These doctor is lovely!!! Great tips and great service, realy awesome!!!
LOL I don't know why but when Michelle uploaded this, I thought about Zayn 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and whenever she uploads another pillowtalk video, I might think of Zayn again 😂😂😂
when I stopped drinking milk my skin got better and my acne completely disappeared
I tried Curology and for me, it definitely worked very great that I no longer have severe breakouts.
David the Derm? More like David the DOM
YES DADDYYY
I have bacne (back acne)! I feel really embarrassed to wear backless dresses or shirts. Help!
michelle, i really love these pillowtalk videos but i just noticed that u haven't posted any makeup tutorials. i really miss your makeup tutorials :(
He's not married, ladies! I see no ring. He's single.
I wish their was a video like this for eczema :(
It's actually IX for 9
PS : sorry Michelle, i love u but i had to say it ^^'
Aww I really wanted to try Curology but I live in the U.K 😭
I wish they also covered body acne because once in awhile I get a few little pimples on my upper back and chest /:
Great video thanks for thinking about this topic :)
I simply wished the products could be shipped to Switzerland
XD That dermatologist is gorgeous XD Lol
I'm vegan and my acne went away after 2 weeks of being vegan!
Hey michelle,  
Awesome vid. But one error, lX is 9 not VlV
JUST AS WAS LOOKING AT MY ACNES AND WHINING, I SAW NOTIFICATIONS AND SAW THIS AND I WAS LIKE. MISH, YOU'RE THE BEST 😭💖
omg never clicked so fast!!!! #oilyskinsquad
Just signed up! Thx for sharing this Michelle
I'm in love with her filming aesthetic, and they're so well done 🤓
NEED MORE VIDEOS.   has spaz attack in corner
I'm disappointed that it's not world wide :(
9 is IX in romans, not VIV
Sigh I got acne all over my face :( 
Any advice?
This is amazing! I cannot wait to try it. I think his idea is wonderful.
why is the curology offer not available for people outside the US
I'm in Germany, why does it always have to be like that :'(
This is so amazing! You've no idea how many people you and David are helping through this video <3 thank you so much xx
Pillow talk VIV?
Should it be IX instead of VIV?
It is Roman numerals right?
loveeeee pillow talks !! always great ❤️
This was so helpful! Thank you, Mish! ❤
I am so happy this video popped up in my subscription box!! This information helped me so much, thank you both:))
Can't wait to try the spearmint tea, going to buy it after work tomorrow! Thank-you very much for your advice! 

-blue
thanks for the tips 👌 and ms. phan you should go for being a dermatologist 😎
MICHELLLLLLLLEEEEEEE!!!!! I love u :)
omg he's cute and his voice is..ahhh
Amazing video ♥ And that Sailor Moon socks too :))
The pillow talks get better and better!! This was great as always Mish!
The high glycemic and dairy thing is soooo true! Also, salicylic acid worked for me in the beginning but I use the benzoyl peroxide (Acne.org's The Regimen) now and it does wonders. I had bad acne for about four years, tried everything. Then I started The Regimen and it wasn't super fast (it took about a year to get clear skin), but it changed my life. I used to worry so much about acne.

Also, I visited two separate dermatologists and it didn't help much. The pills they prescribed stopped working, and so did the cleansers and creams. But this dermatologist knows his stuff ^_^

Thanks Michelle and Dr. Lortscher for this informative video!~ Good luck to those still struggling with acne!
Great Video Michelle Phan.  Keep up the Great Work <3 <3
Can he be my dermatologist? 🤔😍😂
Darn. I can't get curology :( I live in the UK
thank you for this video!!! i now drink herbal spearmint tea and my skin has improved and i didn't even PMS with my period!
LOOOVVEE your hair!! please do a tutorial!!
Just signed up for Curology and I'm so excited!!! Thank you so much for providing us with this awesome opportunity!
@5:52 umm Michelle i dont think i can afford that....lol
Happy Birthday Michelle!!💕💕
Thank you for this!! It came at the perfect time for me! I just signed up!
Omg I love these videos because I have acne and I feel so insecure about myself!! Thank you Michelle!! <3
can't be more helpful love you Mish 💜
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISH!!! ilysm💕😘🎂
Could you do more  makeup tutorials please!!!!💘
A question for another Pillow Talk: What can you do when you aren't comfortable in your own skin?
This is amazing! So helpful !
blue eyed and humble dermatologist.. Thanks for bring him in Michelle!
This was really helpful! I can't afford a dermatologist so I just do what I can with my skin and this really gave me some great advice! (especially for oily skin and that app)
How do you do you hair?! 😍Tutorial pls
I love your hair style mish ❤️
OMG that guy is gorgeous !!!
Thanks for doing this video 
I love you ❄️💕
Recently i started watching your videos and I love this channel now! ❤️
Damn Michelle back at it again with another pillow talk!
Can you do a hairtutorial of this hairstyle? It is so pretty!
Thank you so much for this!! Its really helpful for me and my acne 😊😊👌🏻👌🏻🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️
Thank god for this video. There's a hot guy that's also smart,and actually helped me 
What more coul I want??
My Mom is always the kind of person to buy me drugstore face washes that only end up making me break out even worse so the fact that I'm able to hear what is making my skin worse and what it needs is really helpful. Thank you all so much.
I really like your make up videos, however, I love these types of videos. I really do, because your talks are all positive energy. Besides helping us look good through tutorials, (on the outside) you also help us look good on the inside as well. You're really open minded and I love how you explore and share the things you have learned with us. I say this because most people are close minded, and are filled with so much negativity. With an open mind, you can explore and learn so much about things and people. Thank you for that. ❤️
Happy birthday michelle! from indonesian!💞
loving these pillow talks
this is actually a good video, very useful. thank you <3
he's such a cutie patootie
So like, i ship them? and it's so wrong?
dermatologists HATE her!!!!!1!1!!
I wish they can ship it to Canada as well.... 😭😭😭.... im so sad
just signed up for curology!! very exited!!
Michelle, could you do  pillow talks dedicated to sensitive skin and dry and talk about ways people can do to improve eczema.
This video was so great! Great questions and I loved how relaxed but really informative and helpful he was. Excited to try this out! Thanks so much Michelle :)
I'm not sure but I think 9 is IX? not VIV 
I was just wondering o3o
bummed that Curology is not available in the Philippines 😭😭😭
I think that the Phandom should be here more.
I mean Michelle Phan
Yep. Went vegan and no more cystic acne whatsoever.
So worth it even for skin alone, but there are countless other reasons to go vegan anyway ~
: )
next could you please make a video about diy face masks. (: i love you!
I'm gonna need to watch this a few times.. So much info!
Love the video super informative!! Michelle where did you get your jacket!!!
Just signed up for Curology! Excited to try this
David not just look really good but his voice if so gentle too <3
super interesting! I have a lot of problems with acne and I'm 24!! this helps a lot.
BTW love your socks!!
Anybody else run to get their moisturizer and check the ingredients?
8:52 every time I talk to my friends these days
I've been struggling with acne on my forehead so hopefully these tips will help me with my skin!❤️
Curology changed my life!!
Wow mish, thankyou so much for this video, i've been struggeling with acne since i'm 12 years old. Now i have a lot of scars and regulary breakouts but this vid will probably HELP SO MUCH!  💕
thanks David for coming onto Michelle's channel and for doing something so sweet. You/he really have a charming persona. I haveiffy skin so I probably won't be using it but trust me many will!
Mish! I'm obsessed with your hair! 😍😍😍 tutorial?
Pretty sure the girl was talking facial brushes as in Clarisonics and stuff
Holy smoke, he is handsome!
Super great advice!!!!!!! Thank you so much for posting this video. Keep on making videos Michelle, I sincerely look up to you! xoxo
Michelle's channel takes it above and beyond the normal teen beauty gurus😘 not that there's anything wrong with them I just appreciate how professional and creative the content is here 👌🏼👌🏼
YASS you are on a roll with posting!!
That Cali accent tho ❤️ lol
Just recently got into your pillow talks, so relaxing before bed. Please continue with this series!
But I looove milk ;-;
Ok but why does Curology gotta be only in the us tho?
Just only one thing have worked : acutane ! (for me)
Can you make a space buns tutorial?
this vid helped a lot! ❤
Aloe Vera gets rid of acne scars 😄 Hope I could help!
After I went vegan and started to eat high carb low fat my skin got so much better. I really recommend it. :)
love the vid (9 is IX not VIV) just saying no shade tho
michelle you are really different other youtubers ,thanks for this videos
I'm so glad I wasn't being my usual cynical self and decided to check out this video haha...I've done some pretty hardcore research on regular and hormonal acne (I had mild to serious acne for around 8 years) so I've pretty much heard of everything I can do for my skin by now, but I'm so psyched, spearmint tea is a new one! My skin is pretty clear now, but old habits die hard.... *runs out to buy all the mint teas*

edit: and holy hell that dermatologist is hot
Hey doc, got a pimple on my bum... Can you help me?
Do a makeup look with out BB créme and foundation!!❤️❤️❤️
Guys is Mich still wil Dominique?
I watched the whole video... Then..I was like.. ''Ooh, but I don't have acne.'' 😂 😂
i currecttly have a gel cream which has Myristal Myristate, so sad bc it reduced the redness of my pores, but i have noticed my skin getting clogged up :(
My skin struggle is having eczema, it's horrible.. 
I love her hairstyle by the way, it's so magical <3
It's so humble of you to invite a dermatologist to your pillow talk and letting him give more complete answers to our questions. Thank you Michelle, you are so beautiful <3
He looks uncomfortable sitting like that 😂
Benzoyl Peroxide is heavenly for me...always works for my face...
Love u Michelle !✨💜
He's adorable :3
dayum i want to marry him right now 😍✨
pls make more videos with dominic
can you ask him to make shipping international coz I'm in australia
I was literally taking notes the entire video. I love that Michelle is so knowledgeable on what REALLY works for your skin.
Great video really helpful! So sad that they don't ship internationally 😭😭😭 xx
Going to a dermatologist was the best decision I ever made. After much trial and error with different Rx's, I ended up going on Accutane. Incredibly harsh but I went from have a blemish on literally every part of my face to having perfect skin.
Get the international shipping started pls!
this actually helped so much
daaaaaaaaaammmnnn😍😍
I wish they will have international shipping.
Could you do one of these for dry skin?
Damn David, ...... U R 1 hot Derm.
If you said that the hormones in milk can give you acne what if your drinking organic milk w/out hormones?
Omg had no idea my question was added. You're awesome Michelle!!
wow! this idea is amazing!
Hi Michelle! I love your videos❤️❤️ you are so creative:)  Can you do more favs videos? Love Ya🎀
I feel like everything is a trend report or pillow talk :/ I miss the makeup and hair tutorials

Hey he's my dermatologist! Curology worked for my very oily/acne prone skin! I'm currently in the process of getting rid of my dark marks and very satisfied with my skin:)
How does she get such an amazing purple glow in her room?
another amazing video, hope she comes up with more soon :3 <3
I got so excited about this affordable dermatologist thingy, but sadly it's US only 😢 thanks for all the helpful tips though. Will definitely try to cut out dairy.
Michelle would be amazing at ASMR oh my godd
I love how me matched his socks and shirt
Great video !! I just adore the editing. It's soo relaxing to watch this while eating my dinner :D PS: 9 is IX, not VIV :D but I like VIV. It's symmetrical, and thus pleasing. :D
It should be IX, not VIV... just saying :)
I really want like a part 2 of this :D really helpfull! Thanks Michelle <3
If he's my dermatologist then I will have bad skin every day😂😂😂
I've been given a 42-day treatment of Doxycycline (an antibiotic) by my GP because my acne is considered "severe vulgar acne".
 I have it all year around, even though I do notice an increase the weeks prior to my period, but my acne doesn't limit to my face. It goes down my chest (even on and under my boobs) and down my back, my neck, my shoulders, even my hair roots! Which let me tell you, it's AWFUL, especially for your self-steem. 

If this sounds familiar, do consider going to a dermathologist.

I've heard lots of people with my problem got good results with it too, and the acne usually doesn't come back, so I'm hoping it works.
(It has its down sides, like it messes up with contraception pills, can get your skin red under the sun, can give some people headaches, etc, so definitely ask your doc before hand and read the patient information leaflet before using it. In my case, I haven't felt any different and I've been taking them for a week.)


Also, dang it, I checked one mattifying moisturizer that is supposed to be for oily skins that has been breaking me out and none of those ingredients were in it so I still don't know what ingredient is messing up with my face hahaha
can you do another tech faves video??😃
I really needed this ♡
I recommend to wash your face with natural things such as oats, honey, green tea. It helps me so maybe for anyone else? ❤️
The way he talks reminds me of Schmitt from new girl
Such an informative video, Mish!!! I don't have acne but I have lots of sun spots I've been wanting to get help for... what an amazing pillowtalk! <3
thanks michelle for this video, ive been bully for my ance and people always make jokes like "Do you wash my face!"
I wish this was available in Europe, I would've signed up in a heartbeat! Great video though :))
I wish it was Sandra Lee lol that'd be dope.
He's soooo damn cute🔥🔥😍😍 Why have I never met a hot doctor in real life!
Love your videosmichele can u dodesc
That was soo helpful! thank you :)
Really wish it was also for Canada :(

Can you traduce the videos to spanish please?? 😙😙
Michelle love your hair! Tutorial Please!

Hey! From my own experiences I recommend avoiding products that have saline
Best pillow talk 💕
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISH!!

I am so waiting for another 'Masters of' video
lmfao. love the way they r sitting
crap, its only for people in the US! thank you for the advice on this video though💙
Shouldn't the roman numerals at the beginning be IX, not VIV?
so how should I clean my (makeup)brushes correctly, what product would you recommend ? Is there any brush cleansing product that's not good for acne and I shouldn't use to clean them?😁
thanks for any help xx😊❤️
if you drink milk. Choose organic or vegan.
Wait so how do I get the free product 😭 lol
That dermatologist is hot
Applying vitamin C helps with the scaring tremendously 😃

Michelle can you please do a room tour please
I love that you have an actual dermatologist talking on your channel! So cool!!

You were taking the word right out of his mouth. You shouldn't be shy you are well verse in beauty and skin care! You are MICHELLE PHAN!
Hi Michelle, this is so helpful! Thank you! I've tried to sign up on Curology but unfortunately it's not available in Australia. 😔 are you able to show me an alternative website? Thank you!
Did everyone forget he might be gay? 😂
His smile kills me.. ❥
The derm´s voice is SO relaxing.
#Sailormoon (sailor Mars) socks :D
I stopped drinking cows milk and am only drinking soymilk. I've seen a big difference in my acne👌🏻
The latin number for 9 is IX, not VIV, right?
I enjoy these pillow talk videos Michelle
amaaaaaaaaaaazing job Michelle, thank you!
Great video idea, good advice and the dermatologist is both hot and kinda looks like he wants to kill me (I think it's the eyes XD )
Yes as more pillow talk
Lol. That's my dermatologist.  curology works!!!
youngest dermatologist ive ever seen
not to hate but roman numeral 9 is IX, not VIV although i see where the confusion comes from.
He's saying scientific stuff sitting cross legged next to a emoji pillow.
Kinda liked it.
any tips for acne on your back and chest? I am struggling with this real bad
+Michelle Phan can you please  do a room tour
I wish they named products instead of mentioned scientific stuff lol
could we get a hair tutorial?
I need Dr. David in my life. Hah.
could u do a pillow talk about teenage love and how to spend time with both your boyfriend/girlfriend and friends?
I love this video Mish!! This is how a real YouTuber does it. Uses one's network to bring in people, and help viewers. No one can beat Mish in quality content! <3 Love you!
:( too bad it's not international :( but great video
watch nina and randa on Facebook!  they cured their severe cystic acne on a low fat high carb plant based diet!
did you just wrote 9 VIV in roman numbers? it's actually IX...
can you do a room tour
Ummm obviously when she was asking about facial brushes, she was talking about clarisonic/foreo, not makeup brushes... Can you answer that question?
I see those Sailor Mars socks Michelle 😂💕
This was so helpfull and interesting! Thanks Michelle!!
This stuff really is amazing, I swear it! It's not habit forming, my dermatologist is the sweetest; I chat with her all the time about all of my skincare concerns. Plus it was so quick. I joined as soon as I saw this vid and within a week my formula was made, shipped, and at my doorstep. I didn't have severe acne problems when I started, my major problem was blackheads and discoloration under my eyes, so I didn't expect a big difference but now my skin feels flawless all the time. One of my biggest problems with Michelle's more natural makeup tutorials was that she would be like "just concealer here and here, that's it" and I would be like wtf -__- no I need way more than that your flawless stfu. I'm so much more confident now wearing little to no makeup out of choice. I know that was alot lol but if you read all of it, and you were skeptical, give it a try furreal. Had to let yall know.
where did you get your case? I love it!
As one dreamer to another, id like to THANK YOU Michelle for the inspiration to follow my dreams. After doing so, I've seen so much positive changes in my life that wouldn't have happened had I not taken your advice. I myself am a youtuber hoping to inspire others. One of my biggest life changing moments was when I got into my dream college. I made a video about how I got into my dream school (transferred from UCI to USC), hoping to share my story and inspire others. <3 if anyone's a student, I think this video would help you tons!!
please make a pillow talk talking about your best friend's rejections after getting a boyfriend and thirdwheeling aka how to deal with it ~ love ya
I am feeling hopeful so I signed up for it. Years and years ago I signed up for SkinID. and that was a total fail. I hope this is different. Thanks for the tips. I will definitely be checking my products for those pore clogging ingredients.
Yay. I live in San Diego!
When you get a sheet mask layer of oil on your face what can be done to reduce this from happening? And this is with clean skin.
is it really free? , like I dont have to pay for shipping or the medication for a the month??
And now I'm so sad because I live in France. 😩
Been using Curology for like 2 months. Love it! Cool to hear advice from the founder. :D
My acne cleared up like crazy when I cut out dairy products. Honestly it's so easy to switch to nut milks/cashew cheeses and coconut yoghurt. I highly recommend people look into not just how harmful dairy is for your skin and health but also for the environment. <3
love this video Michelle❤
I am so happy he mentioned diary products in the food that causes acne. For years now, i stopped milk for breakfast and replaced it by Rice or Almond milk. It's hard not to have cheese (especially where I live, in France) but if I totally avoid it, my skin is way more smooth and clear ! I still have a little acne sometimes because I didn't find a substitute to my butter yet.... 
I wish more people would believe me when I say hormones in milk is bad for the skin...It's real ! I know that some people are not concerned but you can try and see if in fact, it wasn't simply that :D
Any make up product with the ingredient bismuth oxychloride can cause cystic acne and severe breakouts, so make sure to check your products! (:
I wish I had something like this in my country! I was so happy when I could click the link and devastated when it was only for the us 😭😭 

xoxo, a girl with severe acne lol
I signed up and will be receiving my products tomorrow! I cant wait to try them :D
I cant help myself when it comes to italian food especially pizza😭😭
Thank you for this! My acne has been uncontrollable. But I've recently been on the pill and also another pill that helps balance my body. It's been doing great so far and I only wash my face with a shea moisture soap bar and origins.
This is an amazing video! I went to a dermatologist when I was a teenager and she helped cure my acne. But I wish I had all this advice and knowledge of skincare back then! David seems so nice too! Great idea for a video Michelle!! ^_^ X
GO VEGAN!! I love these videos!
would love a tutorial on your hairstyle
OMG thank you so much for this video!!! I've struggled with acne almost my entire life! Can't wait to get my Curology and see if it will help me!
When will u do makeup videos again 😔😔
many people clicked this for the same reason, including me, and we don't even have acnes😜
can you please make more makeup tutorials
I ♡ YOU MICHELLE ☆
IX = 9 not VIV... just saying
sees ponds cream contains isopropyl palmitate

okay
you’re going in the trash
being vegan cleared up my skin
it makes sense though because i used to eat grilled cheese like all day er day 1hunnit and i stopped and its been like 3 months and my skin is already way more clear
Omg i love dairy foods so I guess that's the main reason why I have acne 😳
Very young & handsome dermatologist!
Wait a second! Shouldn't '9' be written like IX instead of VIV?! ;p
The animal foods for me made me break out 😁 went vegan now I only break out if I'm not washing my face well enough after I take my make up off
The roman numeral for 9 is IX, not VIV
IT DOESNT SHIP TO AUSTRALIA! What a shame. Was very excited to try it❤️
I can't use the code because I'm not from the US😫
STAY AWAY FROM PROACTIVE !!!
This was so helpful
that's a bomb bomber jacket phanmish
dermatologist looks like Dom don't you think?
Is Michelle and Dom still dating? She hasn't been talking about him as much anymore
I just love how Michelle is such a beautiful person. Not only is she so beautiful inside and out, but she's successful, and seems so smart. I love how she was looking at the dermatologist, listening to everything he said and just being so willing to learn. I love you Michelle!
Hey Michelle! I was wondering if you could do more videos like the Alter Ego look. Thanks ilysm!!!
This was so helpful, thank you! :)) But what is the name of that app ?
A lot of  research shows that it's fats and oils that make acne worse, not starch or sugars.
Well now im 100% sure i wanna be a dermatologist he is fiiiine
THANK YOU!
Happy b-day Michelle!!
MICHELLE THANKYOU SO MUCH! U THE ONLY ONE DID THIS AND IT WILL HELP A LOT OF US THANKYOU SO MUCH WE LOVE YOU PLS CONTINUE DOING GREAT AND MORE POWERS
all you ladies pop your pimples like this, shake your body dont stop dont miss!!
Hello, Mish! Great vid as usual. However, I don't see the 'old' Michelle Phan which is not 'really commercial'. I'm your biggest fan for sure but after waiting for so long, I miss your makeup tutorial vids. No offence, Mish. This is great, this is perfect, but please, keep update your makeup tutorial vids. That's the thing that brought your millions fans here. I love you, Mish. You're very inspirational. And you have positive energy around you. God bless you always. XO
w8 i drink alot of milk bc i wanna grow lol
so true with the milk thing, just talked about with my friend today she said the same thing
Sailor Mars socks💕
WAIT...Chocolate doesn;'t cause acne but sugar does? Seems legit.
MICHELLE I'm from the UK and I can't use Curology!!! This is sad, what can I do??? xx
When I used a face mask with salicylic acid in it I flared up and I had a rash for 3 weeks, it was SOOOO itchy and it BURNED!😭😭😭
I was wondering, if Isopropyl Myristate is a pore clogger, since if contains part of the two terms you listed.
...the roman numeral for 9 is IX not VIV mish
Is it normal to get alot of body acne in your teenage years?
I know this has nothing to do with acne, but omg Mish I love your Sailor Mars socks!!! Hehe ^^
Thank you so much for this Michelle. I tried everything in the drugstore to try and clear up my face but NOTHING was working! I gave up until I came across this video and immediately tried it. IT WORKS WONDERS! I compared my face now to the picture before I started using it and wow I'm so impressed. It helps me feel more confident in my own skin now! Thank you! ❤️
I use all natural ingredients on my skin and it's never been healthier!
Idk but I thought that 9 is written IX...
Am I the only one noticing how bruised his knuckles are? Yes? No? Okay
... roman numeral 9 is IX not VIV...
Love u so much xoxo
He is so nice!! awesome video Michelle so happy you did this!! plus I'm super excited about trying the app!
okay call me crazy but he kinda looks like an older version of Troye Sivan😂
I'm so glad you did this video!
There's a boy who love me so much that whatever I do, he's still always with me. But I really really want to stay away from him. His name is Acne, but some people call him Pimples.
Urgh what should I do :'(
its been 4month since your last makeup video
Do more videos with Dom!
Do they ship the product internationally? 
You should just keep doing your makeup videos
He is soooo right about dairy! Anytime I have anything with dairy in it, I break out right the next day. I stay far away from dairy and my skin looks 100x better without it. The Doc is cuute if I may say so myself =)
I am came for the skin care, only to be blown away by her beauty. What a goddess.
hes so hot and smart and his advice yaas ♥
Does he remind anyone of Joey Graceffa?
I ship them.
Thanks for the video!!
Love this video! I've learned so much more about skincare now and I love taking care of my skin. Bringing this dermatologist onto your series was such a big help!
You guys are a true match.. Look how strong the chemistry
Go vegan
can you please do a tutorial for Tumblr/ig makeup/ootd? thanks
So my bday is coming soon and I need makeup but don't no what to get and have a budget of 30 dollars. So I was wondering if you could do a 30 dollar makeup challenge for drugstore products
now that i'm taking ochem, this makes so much more sense haha.... oh ochem....
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISH :)
I love Michelle but.. Her channel isn't the same anymore.. She rarely even does makeup tutorials..
The way Michelle's face went when the little girl said "I love you" awwwwww I love Michelle
I really wished I watched this video before I went on a skincare shopping spree (':
Im in love w u michelle 😭😭😂
Damnnnn what a doctor???? ❤️👌🏼😬
ZAYN IS THAT YOU
Thank-you Mish for this video. I have ance and this video really informed me. I want to try this web site. & you interviewing the CEO helped me understand what he wants to do by helping people with ance. Thank you girl. <3
The curology doesnt ship to the UK :[
Needed this! ❤️❤️❤️
herbal spearmint tea for harmonal acne??? awsome
i really love this series!!!!
my issue is definitely the really processed high glycemic index foods. I ALWAYS notice a difference when I avoid them.
This was so helpful! Awesome that you got to have an expert as well as yourself answering the questions :)
So sad it is only for the U.S :( Love you <3
VIV? Isn't it supposed to be IX for number nine?
VIV? Isn't it supposed to be IX for number nine?
:( damn I dont live in the US... no curology for me :<
Can he be my dermatologist like woah
"moisturize me, moisturize me."
very informative video! Too bad Curology is only for U.S.
Thank you so much for this video I tend to break out due to stress and eating a lot of junk when I'm having those bingeing days and I've been trying to find the best skin care products for my type of skin and I really found this video useful thank you!! :)
Michelle is like: Oh yeah, that surprised me 😂
Any recommendations for a good spearmint tea? 🍵
Can you talk about keratosis Pilaris next time for pillow talk? I have it and would like to know what's best to treat it. Thanks
do a makeup  tutorial  you always do trend reports and Q and As
aww only for us :c there were some helpful tips tho!
I love you 😍
<Takes Notes >
Thanks Michelle , this enhanced my Acne Presentation that is due Monday ^_^ !! Best of Luck ❤︎

I do have a tiny question if you have time to answer it, does Dimethicone clog the skin since it's a type of silicone. It's a type of silicone oil but apparently, it's in many products such as lotions and shampoo as well. 

Best, Jamie :)
Michelle you always give me the best advice.
Just carb the f*** up Go Vegan
how do you use a eye curler because every time I use one it gets stuck and my e eye pulls out
Happy birthday my sweet heart Mish! Be healthy and stay awesome! Xxx
i wish he could help me someday. I have acne for 10 years straight now, and i'm 20.. thanks for the helpfull video though! :)
Hi Michelle, I know this isn't the right pillow talk to talk about something else than acne xd but I would really like to see in the next video topics like love, cause I really need advice in my situation and I'm tired of hear that someday I'll get a boyfriend but I'm 19 and I haven't got one, and it's not the pressure of having one, it's the feel of loneliness an feeling ugly cause no one has ever told me beautiful. When I like a guy I say it to almost everyone around but him and I can't never get to talk to him bc of my anxiety of being reject, and I spend most of my time thinking that.
AHHH, Love your pillow talks and your videos seen so professional!! As they always have been your the FIRST youtuber I've ever watched on YouTube back in 2011-12. 💜and what's your editing software?
Michelle your hair is gorgeous
When the one girl asked about facial brushes I think she was talking about products like the clairsonic, not makeup brushes. I myself would have liked an answer to that!
Did Anyone else think he was cute lol 😩😆
Well, time to look up some spearmint tea brands.
I clicked on this video so fast lol
I keep getting acne on the tip of my nose....
he reminds me of Joey Graceffa, am I crazy?
its true guys, the only thing that stopped acne for me is eliminating ANY dairy related food..
Y'all being shy about it, I'll just say it - I want him to raw this booty and use his own special serum on my face
I miss you're old videos :( 2012-2013 was the best years...
He's really hot, but this really wasn't that informative, at least for individuals who had/currently have acne.
why is it only available in USA. make it worldwide
It's says it's not available in my state 🙁but I need are there any other solution?pls
Great and helpfull video, Michelle! Just a little sidenote. VIV is not 9 in Roman numbering. It is IX. X equals 10 and you put the I before it to make it 9, just like you did with IV to make 4. Hope this explanation is clear haha. Love you!
Hi Michelle phan do you have a Skype account
PILLOW TALK??!! DO U MEAN PILLOW TALK BY ZAYN??!!! :OOO
Ah man it's not international 😕
excuse me but 9 is IX not VIV ???
rosehip oil helps w scars
Hey Michelle i don't want to be rude but you spelled 9 wrong it's not VIV. It is IX because X is ten and I is one so ten-one=9 
Love you😘
I went to sign up but they don't do it in my state... 😭
mishhhh pleasee pleaseeeeeee do a tutorial of your hairstyle like pleaseeeee
Really helpful video<3
but i love milk
Great tips! I will definitely check all ingredients in my skincare :) xoxo
Awwww I want to try curology but I do not live in USA. 😭
😆 This video is so helpful!! Thank you Michelle and hot dermatologist ❤️‍❤️‍❤️‍
I love this video... !!!
Oh I miss make uo tutorial
hi!! whats that Tea ??
Are her and dom still together?
I realised after a year that protein shakes and milk caused acne
MICHELLE HAIR TUTORIAL
It doesn't work for Canada 😭😭😭😭
I actually have Curology and it made my face drier than I already have it. As of now I still have ance and I'm still hoping it gets rid of my ance
Is mish and Dom still dating ? Because I don't see him anymore?
I FREAKEN LOVED THIS! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I HAVE BEEN DEBATING ON IF I SHOULD BE A DERMATOLOGIST, AND NOW I AM CLOSE TO SURE!
Nooooooo but I love milk! I guess that explains a lot though.
dont understand people that disliked this video lol thanks i learn a lot of.things
woooowew SAN DIEGOOO
I don't have any acne problem at all. But when I saw the thumbnail with such a cute guy in it, it was necessary for me to play 😂 he is just waaaaay too good looking!! 😍 great video, Mish. I could maybe help some of my friends or my sisters through it. Thanks! 💟
I started my free trial, but it keeps saying I didn't fill out my birthday even though I did. I keep re-trying and re-typing it in but it still says the same thing.
makes an appt with dr mc dreamy
Michelle, I luv u so much, words can not explain it! But I'm kinda missing to actual tutorials, ya know? I still watch all of ur vids but it would be nice to see some classic makeup vids once in a while, like u used to. I mean, it's been like months or something since you've posted on. These r just my thoughts and I would literally die if u could maybe get back to me but I understand if u don't. LUV U 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
You didn't answer if  brushes make skin better or worse :-(
He is my dermatologist for Curology!! 😱
happy birthday
I need help I have had acne since I was 8 no one has teased me or anything but whenever  I go outside it makes me self conscious should I cut out dairy?!
What about hyperpigmentation caused by acne ?
i just ordered a curology
I don't think I can live without diary. I eat cheese, ice cream and put cream/milk in my coffee. I do want clearer skin but I don't see myself cutting out those things. :p
Do you have to put in any credit card info or anything for the Curology trial?
This was good but there were not enough natural product ideas presented.
I've suffered terribly from acne back in my highschool life and until now I can say that it still affects me because of the huge scars if left on my face. I lost my confidence at all and eventually suffered from depression because of bullying. People don't understand the pain of being teased from getting pimples or acne. I hope that we all should respect or be sensitive enough in giving remarks to people suffering from acne. I'm kinda happy and proud of myself that I was able to cope up from that dark point of my life. So for everyone suffering from acne right now, I'm telling you.. There's still hope 💗
Fun fact: spearmint tea helps with digestion and bloating. So chug that stuff for a flat tummy.
I wish I would of known this beforehand, i have questions about dry skin and blackheads. Perhaps a part 2, please?

Also Mish, i know it's not your kind of thing but would you ever do a video of how to make your favorite Pho? I love pho so much and would love to learn how to make it at home (i know i can search up a recipe, but i feel this would be more fun.)
Tea? Oh wow, where can I buy it? :D
Curology dried out my skin and just gave me more acne👎🏼
Amazing I'm getting some today
I've been waiting for this video!! I was also wondering how to get rid of scars?
I would feel so nervous if he was my dermatologist
Michelle can you please do a video how to wing your eyeliner
OMG ! I've been staying away for chocolate for nothing ...aww das sad ....
the title screen put VIV for nine in roman numerals lol
It's " IX" not "VIV". Just saying.
I used every type of acne medication and went to dermatologists and nothing helped me. The way i cured my acne was by eating vegan and oil-cleansing my face. Oil is not the devil when it comes to acne, and oil cleansing actually made my skin less oily and much healthier and well balanced. Avoid olive and coconut oil, jojoba works best! I know its scary but give it a try, people have been cleaning their faces like this for thousands of years!
I ONLY use water on my skin. NOTHING else. 
That was the best decision.
I don't know why I'm watching this if I have naturally clear skin 😂
what about blackheads? i heard it was acne too
thumbs up if you couldnt stop staring at the attractive dermatologist 😍
HBD MICHELLE
How do you do your hair Michelle ?
Put him back onnnnn😁😁
Benzoil peroxide worked sooo bad for me. It got so red, and my faco got huge. I had to go to the hospital to get an inyection to stop the reaction :(
Your loosing views mish 😥😫❤️
Unfortunately it only works in the US :'(
Just signed up!!! Can't wait to see if it works
Michelle! I have missed your smart, professional and informative videos... you look so beautiful here! So happy to see that you are stepping into the youtube life again!
Aww to bad.. I see I need a us zipcode. Don't live in the US so can't try it for free😭
whats the background song??
Wow this is so kind of him to do that!!! I'm seriously so excited to try curology I have high hopes!!!!! Better believe after this free trial I will continue to repurchase so excited!! Love you Michelle & thank you Doctor! :)
I'm so happy he didn't say "diet doesn't have anything to do with acne" like how most dermatologists do.
Argan Rain %100 Pure Argan Oil  is such a great acne treatment. Most of the times acne cream will make my face dry out really bad. This product leaves your skin feeling soft and clean. I've noticed my pores have minimized and now I can't even notice them. I don't know how I survived without this previously!! This is a must have.
Michelle I love your hair in this video! Could you please do a tutorial on it?
Is Curology available outside the US? I would love to try it! <3
Sailor moon socks
I'm sad that I can't try this out because I am from Europe and they can only work woth US patients ;-;
Unfortunate for all the international viewers :/
Want to sign up for the curology but I don't live in US :(
okay bye.... flips over table
I just want to start off by saying thank you so much Michelle and Dr.L for introducing us to curology! I'm so very thankful especially for the free first month! I have  lots of acne, acne scars and hyper pigmentation. my dermatologist told me I could never come back to their office because I rescheduled 2 times which I couldn't help, and that's the only dermatology that my insurance covers so I've spent days crying and months feel so insecure about my skin knowing that I can see a dermatologist for this just made it worst...so I really appreciate you taking the time to make this video and partner up with curology to help not only me but hundreds of others who suffer from acne and acne scaring. love you ❤
I have a question what is happen about her boyfriend? Are they together
I bet they don't ship to Europe. :(
Do they ship to Europe?
Love this video^_^
Thank you michelle and your guest for taking the time to do this & share. <3 what should I do if I have rosacea looking on my face :( anyone?
Thank you both so much for the video and free trial of curology! I'm super excited to try this out so hopefully I can finally say goodbye to acne
Sulfur is the best for acne!!!👍🏽
There hasn't been a makeup tutorial in so long...
dang why can't he be my dermatologist, the dermatologists I've had never gave me advice like that AND all the medication I get don't have experication dates on them so I always get paranoid if my face creams are still good or not 😫
wait,, so RICE CAUSES ACNE??? I'm confused w/ the rice emoji :((
I have actually been trying curology for months & it works!!! my skin cleared up 90%! I now receive complements on my skin 😊
wish i lived in the US 😢
OMG IM IN SAN DIEGO
Why he always looked at Michelle's face but not camera? 😂
where can you buy this tea?
wow can he be my dermatologist
Free for a month? that's amazing.. oh wait I don't live in the US... great!! :):):):):):)
thanks for the advice tho Michelle. I'm crying right now because you have been an inspiration since I was just getting into high school life and I'm able to walk confidently even of my condition because of you 😭😭😭😭
Btw I have been with Curology for about 4 months now and it really works!!
mish what about your international audience? It´s only avaible for people in the us :(
plz make a pretty spring or summer makeup plz plz😢😯😗😙
I dont have acne on my face. But my problem is my back acne i tried everything but nothing worked. Its horrible 😭 im too shy to show my back always covering it .help!
I use benzyle peroxide gel cream 5% and it helped me so much!! I tried proactive, salicylic acid products and nothing worked!! It burned my skin twice, so now i only use it on my forehead and not cheeks
I used to have really bad acne but I started using African Black Soap. It cleared my skin up sooo much. It's made of all natural things (ex: oats & more). I think everyone should try it if you're struggling with acne
THERE WAS A RISE EMOJI BY WORST FOOD FOR YOUR SKIN 😱IM ASIAN I ATE RISE EVERY DAY !!!PLEASE TELL ME THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT
I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide. I've heard people say its really good, so once I tried it on a couple of spots on my face and when i woke up the next morning my face was extremely swollen. It was horrible
Happy birthday Michelle Phan!
Do they not ship to the UK? I really need help! ):
2:45 yesss, he's tellin it how it is. Just go vegan!
shut up baby girl, let the professional talk
I would really like to try Curology but they don't sell worldwide 😔
What is the tea he mentioned called? 5:00
Happy birthday Michelle!!
Why does he remind me of Will Ferrell
His eyes are mesmerizing.
he's super adorable omg
How moderate should I drink spearmint tea to reduce hormonal acne? 🍵 Once a day or 5 times a week? I always struggle during my time of the month and I dislike my skin every other two weeks... 😭
I use a device called lumie clear with red and blue light, it really worked for me!!
so vegans would have better skin than people who aren't vegan?
But is he single? 😚😉
He's so cute 😍
Where the tutorials?
I'm allergic to tea tree oil not only doesn't it make my acne worse it gives me boils
They look so comfortable😇👐
it's such a positive surprise to see how herbal spearmint tea seem to help, it's my favourite tea!
he has gorgeous eyes, better than my poop eyes
He's a greek god omg 😍
I found her when I was looking for Phan videos 😄
Such an affordable option! Can't wait to try out!

chocolate does not cause acne!! omg i thought otherwise 😂 I'm so happy! But i love rice! What should I do damn it. I'm asian, i eat rice everyday 😕
Geranium essential oil is super super good for acne scars and it's inexpensive
DAMN DAVID
Try Baking Soda with water, scrub on acne scars, it really helps to fade them away !
The site works only for U.S. :(
What do you use to edit your videos Mish? You edit all of them so well.
Is the free Curology available in other coutries?
Can they ship it to singapore please
If I dont eat dairy how I ingest calcium???
hey michelle I am canadian and I am wondering if Curology is only in U.S?
I want her to collab with Troye. :(
Damnnnn he's a good looking doctor.
I'm allergic to both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid :/
SO sad, I tried using this but don't live in America at the moment

Such an amazing vid by the way! Thank you su much Michelle and David!
hes so cute where did you find him 
I want a hot derm boyfriend
What should I do since I have eczema and acne?Sometimes If I use an acne face wash my skin becomes too dry,most of the time I use body wash on my face which dosesn't take off that  much oil from my skin and sometimes I have to wash my face 2-3 times in order to get most of the oil on my skin off.
Hey michelle! I hope you are planning on doing more pillowtalk.
I'm dealing with seasonal affective disorder, which basically means I get depressed in fall and winter. Normally I look up to the end of summer, but this year its way heavier than normal, probably becouse of a stressfull envirement at home. When I even think of winter coming I feel like crying, and I feel so much fear. 
Do you know how I can deal with my SAD and all the stress?
9=IX not VIV
Michelle could you talk about self harm
It's finals week and I've been pulling consecutive allnighters, now I have cystic acne :((( Btw, if David were my derm, I'd be making more frequent trips per year lol ;)
isn't it US based? :(
Michelle how come u don't do tutorials anymore
Does it ships worldwide?
he is so hot damn
I kid u not...
I
Just
Ate
Ice Cream
what type of moisturiser did he say at 1:07? my English is still not good enough
I'm 17 and still having acne, should i be worry ?
Please do more makeup tutorial please
Dont get me wrong but I really miss your ild videos.
I've been trying to figure out why my skin has suddenly taken a turn towards breaking out, especially since I completely changed the way I ate :(. I lost 30lbs and even my palette has changed but my acne has gotten out of control. I wonder if maybe I need new products now that I changed my eating to purely organic/healthy foods?
How is that tea called? I can't grasp the name.
Do a reacting to old videos !!!!
I wish I had seen this sooner!
they removed the bed that was supposed to be in that studio. i wonder why...
Handsome dermatologist
I broke out terribly after using proactive (I barely had acne before using it) and I applied coconut oil to help the dryness and my acne completely cleared up.
Free trial only in the US  :(
Do clarisonics help or hurt your skin? I've heard mixed reviews about the clarisonics and that it made some people break out like crazy
Are you Vietnamses
When will this be available for Canada?
I don't mean to offend by any means Michelle.. But Roman numerals for 9 is IX.
What is the herbal tea he talked about for hormonal acne?
what do you use to edit your videos???
where you bought that jacket? I got dance show next week and i need that looking jacket
anyone will wish for ache if he was your dermatologist 😁
I swear that dreamer light is everywhere
I would like a makeup tutorial
lol I mentioned curology and how much that helped me on Michelle's last video.
@michelle phan Something is wrong with the curology site. The section asking for a birth date has an auto-fill type thing, but once you select the month, day, and yr, the auto fill puts it in the wrong order so the site will not accept it and I cannot get past the page as it says I've not filled out the fields correctly. 
Would love to be able to try this.
What can you do if you have back acne??I don't know what the do?
I wish acne didn't exist in the first place ARGHHHH throws hands up in frustration
Why does he reminded me so much of Ezra from Pretty little liars? 😂
god dang I love milk and cheese.....
Michelle's Sailor Mars socks 😍
isn't 9 IX not VIV ???
Guys is jojoba oil for dry acne prone skin help
If the Curology product doesn't work during the free month, can we cancel the subscription?
what is the name of the hairstyle michelle wore in this video?
is proactive a good solution?  and is it true that your skin get addicted to benzoyl peroxide
Derm Derverd.
So here's the kind of hot doctors people talk about on tumblr
Only works in the US :'( I hope this comes to Canada!
I tried some clean and clear acne products and they made my acne worse so I changed to neutrogena and it's making my acne way better! They're starting to go away even though I got salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide from both brands😊
I'm interested in the accent of the doctor, where do you think he comes from?
I actually drink a lot of milk so that might be it... But honestly I'm pretty at peace with my acne and I think I love milk too much to quit. Oh well...
Michelle do some beauty video
so i dont live in the uk can i use this??
Do a korean skincare please...
Bleh his advice was basic
i'm a million times more perfect than u and don't u ever forget it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! walla walla
Yasss
Milk is not good. I drink a glass every morning
What happened to dominique ? 😟😟😟 did they break up ???
When you don't get acne...
Dairy!?!! How can I live without milk??🐄
Collab channel looking for members!!
Is the free Curology thing only for U.S. residents??? 😕
GOD!!!!! MICHELLE DO YOU REALIZE HOW LONG ITS TAKING YOU TO JUST POST A VIDEO ALREADY?!?!?!

Her last video with Dom was literally a year ago D:
Such an informative video!! Also, it is just me, or does this specialist remind anyone else so much of Joey Graceffa?
Ahhh should have discuss about back and chest acne problem too ! How to reduce the hyper pigmentation or discoloration due to the acne and how to control the active chest and back acne by using which kind of body skincare regime?
so sad it only ships to the usa :( I am in argentina and I was already suscribing :((((( please made it worldwide
I keep trying to sign up but it won't accept my birthday and I can't get past the screen?
this is a really educational video
His eyes 😍😍😍

I'm French I didn't understand properly what he said for curing hormonal acne? What is that herbal tea?
Pleeeease I need that advice !
Thaaks for responding :)
nooooo its not available in Canada ))):
can i use it if i am not a us resident? (i dont have a us zip code)
Hey! Whats a good spearmint tea?
wish this was available in Canada:(
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MICHELLE🎁🎊🎉🎈🎈😜😝😚🤗😃 love you
Is anyone else annoyed that the Roman numeral for 9 is incorrect?
Thank you so much for being so kind to offer us a chance to visit your site for free , I think that is outstanding, May your business  be blessed and grow.
Hey Michelle, are the products that are given as samples in ipsy tested for people who have acne  prone skin?
9 = IX
I'm sad it's not available to Canada :(
Lol not to be mean but thats contradictory and misleading, you can't say chocolate doesn't cause acne and then tell people to avoid dairy and sugar...  uhhhh most chocolate = sugar + dairy 

Come on now.  Better advice would be if you have to eat chocolate make sure to eat dark chocolate, the darker would be better since it has less dairy and sugar.  Otherwise chocolate will cause breakouts, don't play yourself. I became lactose intolerant at 20 years old and when I did I began getting less acne since I stopped eating dairy so that part is definitely sound advice
Does she not do tutorials anymore
Free trial for US only?
Dear Michelle, 
I need an advice. My little brother is 13 years old and he has only one or two friends. I mean that would be enough but they live far away so he can barely see them. When I ask him about the other students in his class and why he won't start a better relationship to them he refuses to tell me about them. I can't understand why he is a 'loner' because he is actually very funny and smart. He just lacks on confidence. Whenever I can I try to play with him or do something with him but I have much work to do latetly. 
So please please give me an advice on how I could help him make friends. But my friends don't have siblings at the same age.
damn he's hot
what was that tea called?
oh derm derm derm!
what do you do about acne scars?
I wanted to do the online dermo but I live in France...
What if your Whole diet is based on those foods like bread, rice, milk these are pretty much my go to breakfast and dinner. I am young and my parents buy food so :/ but Omygodd this was so helpful thankyou so much !
Can curology please be worldwide?!!
what kind of tea did he mention at 5:02?
it's pretty hard for me to understand 😥
nooo I dont live in the US :'((((
its only for usa?? @michelle kindly elaborate as i live in germany and would love to get the treatment 😒
So sad I live in the UK and won't be able to get this
It's only for people in the US. :(
Lol damn how is one supposed to compete with these rich, good-looking doctors...
I want him touching my face
so cute 😍😍❤️❤️love his eyes
Alright... I'm too old to still be dealing with acne. I'm gonna give this curology thing a try. e_e Nothing else has worked and I was done in by your Sailor Mars socks.
Every derm I see has amazing skin!!!
I'm totally sold kn this website hopefully I see some progress
but isn't chocolate a mixture of sugar and dairy
Free only to the US?
Well this is sad because it isn't in my state
Isn't chocolate a high index food though? Some types are high in sugar, and it's also a dairy product
I was so happy to start signing up to find out they aren't available in my state yet 🙃 I hope it's available soon
The girl who asked about face brushes meant things like the clarisonic, facial cleaning brushes not makeup brushes. Im only mentioning it because i really want the answer! :(
Dairy is full of somatic cells, of course it's going to make you break out
oooo he's my derm
Milk is for babies ;) And I just go natural, I don't eat stuff that I know is bad for me and I don't put all weird stuff in my face :)
It's nature. I love nature.
Michelle again put subtitles in Spanish to the Latino community we love your videos i love you , greetings from Colombia   PLEASE PLEASE ♥
is it seriously for free? i have terrible things growing on my skin
He is soooo cute😍
Wow, this is such a good idea! Internet is changing everything and i love it! I used to have acne and this would have been awsome! Anyway i live in the uk so i dont access tof this service...
I wanna try benzoyl peroxide but I heard that once U skip a day from using it than u break out way more:( I tried using it but my pimples got more red
Curology doesn't work in Arkansas?? That's sad:(
What if you live in other country other than u.s?
does using olive oil on inflammed acne id bad
Whoot whoot! Thumbs up for living in San Diego !
Is there a way i could use Curology outside of the US? Been trying to get ride of my acne for a long time.
Is Curology only available in the Us or worldwide?
I've been using my dermaroller for these BAD red acne scars that's been on my face for 6 months & IT WORKS. it's definitely fading away. I saw results the next morning after just 1 treatment. Highly recommend it.
Good thing I love spearmint tea, haha
How can we get the free trial of curology ??
"diet causing acne"? that is not true. Acne is a skin condition, it is not caused by diet exclusively.
Miss your makeup tutorials, they were the reason I was drawn to your channel, but you hardly do them now!
is curology only available in the US?
I want to cut out dairy but I feel like I won't get enough calcium
Why does nobody ever talk about chemical peels? I've had quite a bit of success with it.
Can you speak vietnamese ?
Is 50 mg zink Good for acne ? I take IT everyday . Pls help
Dear Michelle 
is it safe to use dermo roller ? 
I mean does it have any side effects?
One tip, wash your pillowcase often
Nooooo I LOVE milk
What camera do you use
IX*** not VIV 😶
PLEASE english is NOT my first language what's the tea he mentioned at 5:04 PLEASEEE??!
what if I have to drink milk because of a special diet I'm on?
gofund.me/qqy6npzq
sorry to be a bother I'm just looking for some kind souls to help out
He's hot. 😜
Are those Sailor Mars socks?
Is curology available in the uk?
awh man the website isn't available for canada :(
When I was a freshman in high school, I had a really bad acne and very oily skin and the next thing I know is that my whole family telling me bunch of stuff to try it on my face like proactive, etc. Nothing worked on my skin until I went to see a dermatalogist, who gave me a prescription just for my face and also I researched on my own on how to help my acne get better by cutting on sugar and eating healthy and everything. Now as a junior in high school, I rarely don't get pimples, my skin is wayyy better then before except the little redness and scars around my cheeks and I've completely cut on sugar and dairy and also have been using my prescription for the last two years...I really recommend for ppl with acne is to get professional help, get a better diet and use products wisely since a product like facewash can be beneficial if right for ur skin and atleast wait for few weeks to see the results on your face! One last advice of mine would be is: be very patient with ur skin because it will get better!!!
Buyer beware. I tried Curology for a month and it was great, however they bill you $20 a month for the product but you only get 1oz of product every THREE months and the product only last a month. Rip off.
Michelle is so smartttt
what about back acne. does anyone know of a good body wash for that?
Hey Michelle can u do a video about UV rays because I have a few questions: 1. Is it present when it's rainy, cloudy or when we are walking or standing under shadows? 2. Is it present at night? If not then how long does it last after the Sun goes down? 3. Which time of the day r the rays very powerful? 4. In which season are the UV rays at their lowest? 5. How important are sunscreens, umbrellas, sunglasses, etc.? 6. Do clothes block out UV rays? 7. Which countries have the highest concentration of UV rays? 8. Can u recommend sunscreens for different skin types that are available n affordable? 9. Is it present inside buildings? 10. Which range of SPF n PA is suitable to completely block out the UV rays? 11. What is SPF n PA? Ur very smart and informative and I enjoy watching ur videos. Hope u make this one. When I saw u putting on n talking about sunscreens a lot of times in ur videos I knew immediately that you are the best person to comment this to. Love you Mish 😘
Can people in uk have access to the free trial as well
Absolutely dairy and gluten allergies are the biggest cause of acne. Because allergic reactions are different in people it gets minimized as a cause.
Do pores shrink on its own, when they are clean? Or they just stay bigs as they were clogged?
Home tour
Michelle, I live in the Philippines, is this also free here or just the US? :/
Can we get a updated daily make up routine or even some diy videos you used to do with even the simplest things.. Miss them lots mish
The dairy thing is so real for me. My hubby and I moved back in with my parents recently. We haven't really had dairy since because 1. my mother is lactose intolerant, and 2. we are all sharing a fridge and I don't buy any extra things since they won't fit. My skin cleared up so quickly, and now has a glow back. I only get 1-2 pimples every few weeks now, most likely hormonal.   Plus I've been using the Pixi by Petra Glow Tonic and that's been amazing as well.
What works well for whiteheads??
What is her snap
Happy birthday Michelle
Happy birthday Michelle
And what is he really talking about? Like what should I do if I have acne or bad skin?
what is the kind of tea that the doctor mentioned?
Feel really awkward reading the comments after eating two packages of Bulgarian yogurt today...
My boyfriend breaks out when he eats Chocolate
I can't sign up to curology because my zip code is invalid.... I live in Puerto Rico, but it is a US territory... What can I do??
Can they only do the free thing in the US?? I live in canada
i dont speak so well english , but someone can tell me which tea is antiandrogen? i dont understand that part , herbal .....tea , thanks!
Correction.Chocolate is dairy...So, yeah chances are that u might break out.
i have a question is lactose free milk okay if you have acne
Michelle help! I use a product that has 10% benzoyl peroxide in it and I feel like it works really well for my acne but then it makes my face dry. it's been a struggle for me to have soft skin without acne and I have no idea what to do. I don't know a lot about moisturizers but I try to use cooling oils sometimes. It'd be nice for a recommendation.
I legit jumped on the site as soon as they mentioned it and then realized it's not international.That sucks,I really wanna try their products cus I trust Michelle.Guess I'll have to wait for them to make it available...
he looks like Sean o'pry
Do they treat backacne?
If i only lived in the US D:
Omg the girls in the snapchats are so young 😭😭
How do you control acne from hormonal medicine?
hi michelle can you kindly do a video on how to clean make-up brushes neatly? cuz I feel that getting them washed with water makes them even dirtier :( thanks a  lot :)
I can't live without bread & cheese though..😔
Hey Michelle! What's the exact name of the tea mentioned in a video around 5:20? :) English isnt my first language so I couldn't catch the name.
guys, curology really really works, I promise. you're not going to see overnight results, but I've been using it ever since late June and oh my goodness I cannot tell you how much my skin has cleared up. I got my formula worked with everything except anti-aging, but I'm probably going to get that added since my dark circles are not cute (my sleep schedule is gone). my acne scars have lightened up so much, my blackhead scars are barely noticeable, and the occasional zits I used to get are no more. I haven't even been using curology lately (bad, I know) but my skin is glowy and clearer than ever. I tried everything before using curology and seriously nothing has given me the results that curology has. if you guys are suspicious about it at all, you should have no worries to try it. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I have :) (I wasn't paid for this or anything at all)
no brainer that food like dairy and starch causes acne.. it produces mucus in the body.
Hi +Michelle Phan I love your videos, because they have so much of tips that make us better 💪. I'm 12 years old and if you can understand I am little 👣. I would like if you keep making the 🎀GIRLS GUIDE🎀, because I have learned a lot of things of your beatifoul videos🍃🌈⛅. And also you are beatifoul too 👸, no one can make that precious videos than you 💕. And I'm from Chile (that is in South America 🌎 on the coast if you don't know) I speak spanish and I watch your videos with subtitle in spanish, but I can speak english very well, no? 
If nothing more to say I gave you a big hug, regards Esperanza (Hope in english) 💖👍

That awkwardness when you live in San Diego
I have acne on my arm, face, legs and chest.
Does anyone know how to get rid o the red spots that pimples leave ?
I use curology :) I use to have pretty nasty acne and it's now gone ^.^
Is it available in Canada?
What can I do to shrink the size of pores on my face due to popping pimples in the past. :(
My parents force me to drink milk every morning and night, which causes A LOT of acne for me. I cant seem to convince them that i have the freedom to eat or drink whatever i want and that my skin is very sensitive and acne hurts on me..
It's only for the U.S...... That is so disappointing... Everyone only helps the U.S. not Canada...
YES! I used Curology, and Dr. Lortscher has helped me so much. Found him through the SCA Reddit community. I plan to write my B & A soon. Kind of scared to but the Reddit SCA has helped me so much! <3 Thank you Curology.
omg why isnt it, world wide shipping !? :((((((
are there like special things to do when you get pimples on your period
Thank you
he said drinking milk can cause acne right ? but what about yoghurt?
Hey Michelle! I love you <3!! I have lots of blackheads and I'm wondering how I get rid of it because I'm worried that my skin might be allergic to some products.
I want more makeup videos !
Great topic. As a 41-year-old, I'm dealing with hormonal acne. I've never had acne before in my life, and I'm quite at a loss for what to do about it. Curology sounds like a great option. Thanks Michelle!
happy birthday michelle
Do you have any home remedies for mild acne?
What about black heads whats the cure for them !
which tea did he say??? i didnt understand 😓
did michelle and dom break up?
is she still with dom?
Guys I found Curology through Nabela Noor...and omg a decade of acne gone in 2 nights! and so cheap compared to stuff you get from clinics. pls try it!
Just wanted to say that I have tried curology about 1.5 years ago when it was still called pocketderm and it worked very well for my moderate acne!!! I was even assigned to Dr. Lortscher back then too ... Surprised to hear his voice! Not sure how it is anymore since I only subscribed for half a year but response times and delivery times were very fast back then and my skin definitely cleared up. (I had moderate hormonal acne from my nexplanon).
The tea they were talking is HERBAL SPEARMINT TEA. I saw a lot of people asking in the comments, so I figure I should just write it down.
Is Apple Cider Vinegar as a toner diluted with water or not great to kill acne bacteria.
What kind of tea was he talking about?? English isn't my native language
Hi Michelle, I am taking my engagement pictures this summer and fall. Its mid day and sunset, do you have any make up ideas you can share? I like simplicity, any advice or video can help. Thank you!!
I have acne only on my nose but it's still really annoying. I've tried everything and it just always seems to come back. I hate it so much
what tea was that? the antiandrogen one?
what about Isopropyl myristate? Does that clog pores? I have been having really dry skin so I have been using Cocoa Butter on my face. It has that ingredient in it. Will it clog my pores?
I have hormonal acne and always had a hard time getting it under control, it takes a couple of weeks after my period to go back to clear skin and the more time goes between my period (I'm not regular at all although I'm 29... Thanks PCOS), the worse it gets! I'll try the herbal spearmint tea and hear to curology right now!!
Thanks for this video :)
whats the name of the tea that helps with hormonal acne?! I didnt understand
OMG HAHAH THESE COMMENTS ARE KILLING ME. he can recommend chicken grease for my face and HELL I WOULD TO XD
hottt
I kept cringing when the young girls kept saying they have acne...well unless it is diagnosed I don't have a say but I strongly believe that most of u guys jus have breakouts..its puberty it will happen
milk is a devil to me
guys I just read the comments lmao da fuq w/ you haha it was a pillow talk about acne not about the physical appearences of the dermatologist hahahaha im.laughing hard
You're so great. I wish your videos were around when I was younger.
Is Curology only for people living in the U.S ? :(
Did anybody sign up and what do you think of it??
I drink milk on a daily basis like I'm the only one in my house who drinks it and i go through an entire jug in less than a week omf
No hormones in any dairy or meat made in Ireland :)
I did a derma roller treatment !! and also have a derma roller :) and yes if you have active acne its not a good idea but it def helps with left over scarring and white/blackhead! :) xo great vid! also vegan all natural face products work best for my skin esp products with tea tree oil! and I take maca root in smoothies or capsules it helps with hormonal acne! :)
So then what can you do to replace the nutrients you need from milk
What do they mean by herbal "experimental" tea?
+MichellePhan Hi Michelle i tried signing up for curology, but they only accept zip codes from the U.S. is it not available for Canadians??
I tried curology for about a year, and while it did work on my hyper pigmentation it wasn't working for me as far as clearing my breakouts went! I actually had this same dermatologist! But I quit curology because I wanted something more natural to use on my skin! I just uploaded a video about how I have cleared my skin using natural products if you are interested in that sort of thing!! <3
Where did you get that jacket Michelle?
michelle,where you live in canada or ...........?
Ughhh curology isn't available in South Carolina. I'm heart broken. I've been trying EVERYTHING
it's only for the us :/
I don't live in the U.S... Does it still work??
+Michelle you are Asian? am to you're really inspiring and pretty plzz put my name in any giveaway because I need makeup and wanna be a beauty guru like you plzz reply😅😅I have hope from you😊
Hey Michelle, I live in Europe, Romania. How could I use Curology here? I would really give it a try to cure my acne! I always hate how you and your collaborators have such great ideas, yet I can't try any of them. Kisses! :*
Really love your hair Michelle!
Noooooo checked the jar of my favourite night cream and it had one of the pore blocking ingredients in it. 😢
Okay so I don't have acne but I have been getting allot of pimples that are under the skin and won't come to the skin so that I can pop them ... any help?
I completely agree with every single point in this video. 👍🏻 I'm visiting a doctor/dermatologist now and the fact that I have someone actually checking up on my skin and going through in detail what I should do really helps. My skin is so much better now and tbh, I'm 100% more confident than before. When I booked the appointment and I entered the clinic, I had all types of acne be it big or small or hormonal. To say the least, my face was a trainwreck. But as soon as I started the prescribed treatment and pills, my face instantly started getting better and not just acne-wise. My skin tone grew brighter and more even and I just felt that my faith in skincare and treatments was restored. ☺️ The reason why I'm so passionate about this is because every single thing mentioned in this video was what helped me in the process. I actually conducted my own experiments with diet where I went from eating everything to being vegetarian, pescetarian and even was vegan for a week once and let me tell you, 〰️ EATING CLEAN IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 〰️ It helped cure my acne, it helped boost my self-esteem and I feel so much healthier and therefore, active and less tired. I've recently gone back to eating everything except dairy products and processed/fried foods and my skin is still intact. I'd say that diet is the most important tip in skincare and other problems as well. Another thing I discovered on my own that is so important is 〰️ BUYING PRODUCTS MEANT FOR YOUR GENDER. 〰️ I'm not entirely sure how scientifically proven it is, but it has definitely affected my skin greatly. I used to buy over-the-counter or expensive skincare products that were meant for women and honestly, it broke me out even more and I didn't understand why. But then I had an epiphany one day and decided to just buy men skincare. The one I bought was Neutrogena's facial cleanser and it just happened. My acne started disappearing and my skin felt so much nicer to touch. Now, I stick to skincare for my gender and it really helps. That's all I have to say based on my experience. Hope it helps! Thank you Michelle and David, I'm glad you guys are doing this because it is honestly so important and I'm happy that you're sharing this with everyone. ✨(I am actually very close to tears right now because it has been such a roller-coaster ride and I'm just very thankful that the two of you are doing such great things for people suffering with acne. Thank you. 💗)
what is ance
Does the website ship products overseas?
Is curology only in the US
thanks
david the derm? more like daddy the derm.
This is so dodgy, they prescribe you treatments from a selfie? Really guys??
chocolate doesn't cause acne!! yeahh!!
What are examples of high glycemic foods?
holla holla holla. First they say that using benoyl peroxide makes acne worse and can make people flare up but then they say that benoyl peroxide helps with redness and irritated skin. should I use it or nah cuz I got those problems?
Roman numeral for 9 is IX...
is she active on sc? I added her but I never see her story?
No wonder my pimples won't go away, I eat breakfast cereals everyday and drink the milk.
Has anyone here tried herbal spearmint tea for hormonal acne? What were your results?
Can't see her new hair colour
And his dimples omo x.x
What if i'm not from USA? I'm from Indonesia. Can I use curology too? 
She looks like Khalessi so pretty
I wish it has subtitles. Sorry 4 my bad English
I feel like not one person who shows up on Michelle's channel will appear to look ugly, like everyone we've seen on her channel look freaking amazing and I'm here like...
I feel like the girl that was asking about facial brushes was talking about cleansing brushes, like the Clarisonic. I don't think she meant makeup brushes...
I hate pillow talk
Never heard of the spearmint tea one. That surprises me because I've literally tried ever method ever.
Girl, David is delicious. Mhmmm.. Mhmmmm..
Watcing this video in 2017? Anybody? I miss her alot.
I get acne from chocolate, and I have controlled for it 😕
too bad its only in US :(
I can't afford the prescription =( is there a site that lets you do a similar thing, but instead of giving you a prescription it gives you personalized advice?
Does isopropyl myristate break out your skin?
Happy birthday!!!!!!🎂🎂🎂🎂🍰🍰🍰
Sailor Mars-like socks, soooo cool! :)
Good job Michelle
Gel moisturizer?? Where can I get that?
Seriously guys, can you be a bit more mature for once? Look past the "looks" and more into the pivotal information he's conveying
What is the name of the Tea?
Women would literally die for any guy 😂😂😂 I only appreciate his advise. There are models you can stare at on Instagram
+Michelle Phan do karai makeup tutorial from Nickelodeon teenage mutant ninja turtles plz I love this show :)
Can curology PLEASE COME TO NZ?!!?! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOREVER.
I can say from personal experience that processed sugars was one of the causes for my stubborn acne. My dermatologist recommend it, and now I haven't looked back! If anyone is struggling with acne, please give this a go!
I'm allergic to Salicylic Acid and I have acne on my forehead 😒😒😒 recommend me anything?
I stopped drinking milk and eating dairy products such as cheese and ice cream and though i didnt have very bad skin to start with, i have noticed that my skin is looking a lot better than it used to. So yeah cutting down in dairy products does help, at least for me. My mom got really mad about me not eating dairy anymore though :s
When he said icecream, I died because I love it and I eat it in large portions each day. Sigh
Has anyone tried to sign up from the app? From the website version, it doesn't ask you for images of your acne but in the app it does? Is that true? Are images not needed at all?
HAPPY 29TH BIRTHDAY MICHELLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT ONLY GET BETTER! I had really bad skin at one point where my skin would be congested and red with acne! I felt like nothing helped I used everything. And nothing worked. 

- double cleanse with oil first to break down makeup and then use a foaming cleanser after use a micellear water (optional)


- HYDRATION! Hydrate your skin I used la rochaay possay serozinc with aloe Vera gel

- serum corrector use a vitamin c to improve scars 

Moisturiser cream for the day 

And moisturiser cream at night with an oil such as Sunday riley Luna or nuxe oil 

Helped me so much don't waste your money on anything else
oh can you only use curology website if you're in the USA :(
Can someone write me down what type of tea they said in the video? Thank you!
WHERE IS DOM DID THEY BREAK UP
he is hot 😍😍😍
I am currently using Curology thanks to #Nabelanoor it is working so far and I hope my acne goes away. I just started about a month ago. I need to cutout dairy for sure... 
hi, sorry i didnt quite get what kind of tea did he mentioned... did anyone know?
How do I get just the free month and not have to pay for anything after that?
is she still dating dom
I think the facial brush question might have been about Clarisonic type products, not makeup brushes. I'd be curious to see what the answer is to that question!
The people who are asking the questions don’t even have acne 🙄🙄🙄🙄
I'm not living in the states. Can I still try curology? I cant register cuz I dont have a US zip code :(
Pet peeve, using roman numerals wrong, 9 in roman numerals is not not not VIV, its IX :x That really bothered me. VIV isn't even a number ...
I have a big question ( do have a dermatologist I consult, he is one of the best in my state) for people with very ultra sensative skin (or with cold sores/HSV), what can I do to help since I have moderately bad acne that is very red, note that some cleansers are to harsh and make me break out in cold sores. I would really like for you to get back to me on this one as soon as you can, thank you so much.
Dis was posted on me and your bday
My facial cream has the isopropyl plamitate yet it says won't clog pores. I think I will just switch to a gel moisturizer.
Has she really been gone for a year
What did he say .. "Use a ... Moisturiser".. What was the word can't hear it clearly .. Anyone? :(
i started to sign up, but they apparently aren't available in my state ):
where is michelle's bomber from?
Did you mean chase from Zoey 101?
Does anyone know when the offer expires?
+Michelle Phan cud u plz do a how to start a yt channel series? I have been wanting to start one for a while but don't know how. Really want ur help and expertise.
It's only Americannnnnnnnn

What kind of tea did he recommend for hormonal acne? Sorry, but i did not understand 🙁
Where is she she hasnt posted in 2 to 3 weeks
Hi, I live in France and can we join the website by living in another country? It was a very interesting video Michelle, all my love ❤️
I don't get acne
hey guys! i found using baby products if really helpful when treating acne. I use doves baby bar soap and honest face and body lotion for babys! it works rly well
Has anyone tried clindatech solution? I've just started it as my doctor wants me to try it. It's expensive but I hope it works. So far I've reacted a bit to it with little bumps but not big pimples like I was getting
Chocolate and caffeine break me out terribly. Everyone is different!
i stopped eating and consuming dairy and girl let me tell you, my acne was gone, i went from getting like non stop 4 or 5 pimples to just 1 or 2 pimples a month and thats only on my period. try it , you'll notice results fast
does anyone know how to get red of body acne scars?
This guy has to be either gay or a psychopath... just hating here but if my gf had acne I would tell her that she is beautiful no matter what instead of letting  her go see this dermatologist lol
maybe I am the only one who miss old Mischelle makeup videos...
did anyone have trouble trying to sign up for Curology? can't seem to get the website to accept my birthday date..
I had horrible acne all throughout high school and it wasnt until i tried curology that my skin FINALLY cleared up and stayed clear. ive been using it for almost a year now and i couldn't be more happy with my skin (:
español por favor
so helpful
Definitely the dairy causes acne, because I'm a huge milk drinker but it caused me to break out. I switched to organic milk (which doesn't have hormones.) and it seemed to help a bit, but cutting down on drinking it (I can't quit cold turkey, because I don't like soy or almond milks.) and drinking more water helped me a lot.
mmm he's cute
i like your socks, michelle
I used my Curology way past the expiration date and it works as good as it did when I first got it. Sometimes expiration dates seem more of a liability issue than anything else.
Does anyone know where I can see remedies or any treatments for acne on my back and arms? :)
waawaawawooommmmm ;) he's cuuuuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It's so true about the dairy , those hormones make a huge difference . Eating more vegetables and using natural sweeteners can really help. It helped me so much, now i try to eat dairy once a week.
I have red scar on my face. I started using some products which actually make my scar lesser but after a few months it stop working. Why does this happened? And please recommend some good products for scar. Tq.
Curology is the worst thing ever don't try it guys !!!! 😭😡
Did anyone else try to sign up, but it said that your birthday was invalid?? It's accepting everything else, but won't accept my birthday or any other ones I put in (to see if it would work)...
Those dairy tips were sooo true! When I cut off dairy completely, my skin has been a miracle. I haven't had a single acne or even a breakout since nov-dec of 2015 'till now and hopefully still counting! Anyway this video is really helpful, thank you michelle! Xoxo
Reaction of Michelle at 3:44 hehehe.
He's so hot!
Facial acne is commonly discussed but what about back acne? I've had it for many years and I still can't get rid of the scars and pimples. There're so many beautiful clothes that I can't even wear due to bacne! Please help :(
You need to drink milk to keep your bones strong but my face has to suffer
Has anyone tried herbal spearmint tea? Does it actually work? Thanks so much in advance!
Just tried but its not yet available in my state (Louisiana) :(
Lysm
I feel like North America injects more things Into their food like eggs, which is why I don't eat them anymore. Makes my face bad. And coffee. I've heard of herbal tea being good for acne - hormonal. Didn't know it was spearmint ;) nice info
Watching this again
Anyone know any tips for how to get rid of oily skin?
what is the tea called?
Dear Michelle, You are just not posting anymore 😭 I haven't posted in like soooooo long and I miss the old Michelle who typically posted weekly :( C'mon, your whole career started from YouTube and now it's like your way too busy and fancy for all of us. I know this is just a little bit rude, but I just really want the real Michelle. Love you so much💕 ~ Daria_Duz_Things
Do you have to subscribe after your free month trial? or can you just try and then stop if you don't like it?
Awesome video :) I love your pillow talks ^-^ Is this available for non U.S residents too? I would like my little brother to try Curology
is just me or anybody thought that they removed the bed and put the couch instead so it wouldn't make uncomfortable being the bed with him? I know it sounds pervert >.< but I thought it was smart and prudent to do it haha.
I use curolgy and i have tried not using and using other products and i always go back to curolgy its the best.
how did she do her hair?
also going vegan helps. i had acne and my derm said i should eat a plant based diet and eat less fatty food and here i am having clear face and beeing happy
Washing your face with soap and water,, drinking plenty of water and laying off of foods that's high in sugars has helped improve my face TREMENDOUSLY...Not sure about the dairy product thing. Everyone is different maybe...very good vid
Michelle, how did you get your hair like that? Anybody here in the comments can show me a tutorial?
why does michelle's face look so long o.o
Ok so i can't eat rice.............that's going to be a problem............………I'm Asian. So I eat rice everyday. What to do !?!?
all these ppl who have acne problem are mostly with oily skin.. I had acne problem like there were time it was horrible (bad reaction from a certain skincare and supplements tht came w it) but I had dry skin.. I've never heard any solution with acne with dry skin. Today I get some zits here n there and get even breakouts if I skip night time routine bcuz when I wake up Im a little dry and see new breakouts. so yeah I breakout when my skin gets dry. But I have uneven skin texture on my forehead and cheeks (not pores) its like tiny tiny little bumps (not millia) n it gets worse n sometimes better. My goal is to get smooth flat skin but quality of my skin is not so good as in sunlight the texture of my skin is bad. how do I get rid of it or get better quality? (btw I do exfoliate and all that)
look at all the girls in here who want his D
actually what helped me ..was visiting this kind of dermatologist on my own...she have seen my face and she pescripted me some skincare products that helped me treat acne insideout... now I am using them for my morning and night routine ...I dont have any acne anymore just maybe once in a while small zit here and there...then she adviced me to use skin care products from pharmacy like bioderma and so on for acne skin ...and also my make up from pharmacy( I use LaRoche-Posay) so my face would not get clogged (I know my comsetics got a lot more pricy but my skin is really clear) and a the end she adviced me to always clean my brushes even desinfect them..and not to use any sponges because they have a lot of bacteria inside ...even if you cleaned them... and try to dry your face with napkin not towel :D now I will go on check up to her when I will fly back home and she will tell me how should I continue to treat my face or if there will be another treatment with acids needed :D I also recommend using sunblock to protect face from scaring and blemishes.. also from pharmacy :)
Cutting out eggs and coffee(iced cappuccinos) out of my diet has saved me stress and my face from pimples and cystic deep within the skin acne. I don't miss them nor have I thought about adding them back into my diet. To think back and remember how much I picked at my face, and how much my face hurt to the point it was scarring and itchy and covering it with makeup was hardly a confidence booster knowing how bumpy and texturized my face was underneath. Try maybe cutting out what I did, it wasn't easy for me, I would go back to it a few weeks later, then adjusted to the new change until it became less and less acne then never again did I want to add them back into my diet. . Cause once you see your skin improving and you add bad foods and drinks back into your skin and your skin acts up again, it's so not worth it. To think how much money I spent on all these skin products. It's crazy. It's a challenge to let go of things you love, but it's all in a persons head cause they're used to it
Not gonna lie I loved Michelle Phans makeup tutorials now a days is so boring. 😐 still enjoy her older videos. :) specially her little story videos.
hey michelle, there are a few great foundations that are out there that have skin supporting ingredients and clean ingredients that might also help individuals with product inducing acne. jane iredale has been great but there are tons of options out there that have great ingredients that also can stand up to more common foundations. thanks!
I was waiting for him to say that dairy can be linked to acne. I swear that once I stopped drinking cow’s milk and limiting my cheese/ice cream intake I noticed significantly less break outs in under a month. I substitute milk with almond milk (and drink at least two glasses daily) and though dairy products do taste great, I have found that it is well worth it to get clearer skin. If you have been struggling with acne, PLEASE TRY THIS!
the only problem I have is terrible dark circles
its US only :(((( no cNada!!
Any tips for blackheads? And I have like a white ball like pimple but really hard and in middle blackhead...
chocolate doesn't make acne worse specifically, but eating a lot of processed foods and sugar, as well as dairy and unhealthy fats definitely make acne worse.  Everything in moderation!
Should I go see a dermatologist for me black heads on the side of my nose? I've tried everything but they just don't seem to want to come off... :(
Wtf he's so hot
porque ya no le pone subtitulo a sus videos???
Wish I can convince my parents to go vegan. I feel like the reason why my acne is this bad because of what we've been eating. I always want to make an excuse so I wont go to school because its embarassing as heck. Plus, its burning outside. Makes my face more oily. Plus more acne. :/ Damn, public school's here in the Philippines.
I dislike this series
michelle why cant curology not available in Europe?  Even your fans are in Europe :(
I've cut out most dairy products from my diet (not for cruelty free reasons, to help with acne) and to be honest my acne has gotten worse. Is this caused by a sudden change in my diet or is this not a good way to heal acne?
It's funny watching this because I had to discover through an article that milk and dairy caused my acne. My skin was amazing and then I started consuming more cheese and dairy products. All of a sudden my skin was covered with breakouts. If anyone is suffering with cystic acne try cutting dairy and drink lots and lots of water !!! Believe me, it works !
I have the kind of acne that doesnt have a head and is really deep and when i touch it it feel liquidy. How do i get this thing out it doesnt have a head and it is really annoying
VIV, I think the roman numeral you mean is IX.Also, Mish, those are some of the coolest socks in the world.
Worth mentioning: If you are having hormonal acne and you're nursing or pregnant - check with your midwife or doctor first, or do a search for galactagogues, which are things that can decrease milk production.  Mint is one of those things.
8:00 I think she was talking about brushes for the face when using acne products...lol, I know this video is old and no one will probably see this comment but, yk...idk
When I was younger, everyone would always tell me to drink more milk and that dairy products make your bones, teeth and nails healthier. And now everyone is saying that dairy is bad and causes acne??! What do I do???
Honestly, I'm not really worried about acne now because I am 15, do not wear make up, eat healthy so I know it's normal for my age. One thing I can't do is give up my milk, because I LOVE milk. But I have my cleansers and moisturizer s... I see a dermatologist every months
how am i suppose to cut RICE out of my diet. honey i'm vietnamese. i eat rice every single day. and don't even get me started on the ice-cream
I will drink milk and my chest will be broken out the next day. Milk is something that everyone with acne should pay extra attention to their skin before and after drinking milk.
I would rather have acne then cut out dairy products
Is the bacteria that grows in home-made lotion [shea butter, coconut oil, vitamin e, beeswax, cocoa butter] anymore dangerous than the bacteria that grows on human skin naturally; Does a person need to add a preservative to home-made lotions?  It would be nice to hear a doctors opinion.  Some people use a preservative and others do not.
Dont think she realised the last one was asking about clarisonic exfoliation brushes not makeup brushes
They said that chocolate doesn't cause acne but if you eat milk chocolate it has dairy so wouldn't you still be consuming dairy and it would contribute to giving you acne to some extent. I'm guessing that not a lot, sense I don't think it contains a lot of dairy but still. Or were they talking about dark chocolate?
How to get rid of blackheads?
Am I the only one who still views Michelle's old videos?
I also thought that girl had pretty nice skin. I was like where are the scars?
its only for American addresses :( I got soon excited!! :( :( :(
+Michelle Phan I've been following you since long and using your tips for skin care but these days none of your tips work. Actually the place I live in gets extremely hot during April-March and hot and dry winds blow here carrying huge amount of dust with them. They are called ‛loo'. The sun is too strong here. And this weather condition have a bad affect on our skin. Can you please help me out by making a new video
but...chocolate has milk...and sugar...
Why isn't it available in Australia? 😭😭 I need this
HES FINE AF
I drink milk everyday 😐
Diet. Does. Not. Affect. Acne.
after becoming vegan, my acne cleared entirely!! eating/drinking milk made a huge difference in whether or not the acne returned. because a lot of chocolate has milk in it (either milk or white chocolate), you can't really say that chocolate isn't entirely acne-inducing. but anyone looking into clearing your skin for a lifetime, please please look into a plant based diet! :)
How many cups of spearmint daily would be good? I've been drinking three cups a day but I recently read some websites saying it's also has some bad effects in women :(
Does anyone know how long the free trial is offered for? I've been out of the country, and I just saw this video tonight (2 months after it was posted)!
So genuinely interested in trying this I have dealt w/ MANY years with acne and it is not that bad now but it could be better. Anyways is this like get one month free and then they start charging u afterwards? Because if so..I don't have the money for it :/. If someone on here decides to try it, please tell me how it goes! I'd love to know! Thanks so much! 💓
Please help me... I don't know what's going on with my skin. It is not oily at all and has no dirt on it but I get pimples all the time and they're really big and hurt really badly. What is this?? 😭
Has anyone USED curology and have seen successful results with it? I just signed up today for curology. I do not have horrible acne but I do have blemishes that are bad enough so that I need basic coverage &also, I have huge pores from previous blemishes/acne. I hope this works since michelle kind of recommended it.... :/
This is so annoying. Its only in the US. I live in the UK 😣😭😭 not fair!!
i know a ton of ppl are skeptical about this idea but if you go on a strict diet or cleanse and only eat whole wheat bread, brown rice, vege and fruits (avoiding any kind of meat, chicken, fish etc) it might  help. idk but it worked for me. my face cleared up in a few months. with the help of some facial appointments too
It's not yet available here in Louisiana :((((
Hi Michelle! I had a pretty short story about how I got rid of acne. During my teenage years my skin was totally acne-free then when I turned like 22, I guess. I started to get small zits, its not severe but every now and then these little zits were insisting and its annoying! Then I watched some DIY facials, and I found raw honey for morning and evening facial wash. I also like to let it settle on my entire face for hours and I got amazing results! Up until now I am still using it for some tiny zits, because Im living here in the Philippines we have tropical climate here and some people says that temperature can affect the acidity of our skin. ;) And recently I been using apple cider vinegar as a toner and just like honey. It is amazing! :) Aside from that, these two are natural ingredients so guaranteed no harm effects! Hope some of your viewers would read it so they would know and I will be glad if they would try it. Thanks! Just sharing my experience about acne. Godbless everyone!
Can you at least drink milk once a day or like once a week or month?
Does powdered milk count??? I know i sound stupid now but i just want to assure. Thanks
He looks like Joey Graceffa.
If you have acne I HIGHLY recommend tea tree oil as a spot treatment. It's natural and you will see a difference in the size and appearance of the spot within 24 hours.
Why does he sound totally gay?
Descendants pl$ssssssss.:-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
thank you michelle and dr david... very informative

Love this series!
Thanks soo much Michelle! 💕 This was a super helpful video! I've been going through a weird acne breakout lately (more so than usual) and I honestly don't know why; my diet is pretty clean. I'm definitely going to try curology!
I love Curology! Been with them since they were PocketDerm
You guys only mentioned acne with oily skin but I have acne with dry skin :(

Ok so when he said chocolate doesnt give you acne i was like "really" because i have VERY sensitive skin and acne prone skin and if i eat the smallest piece of chocolate i get a pimple the next day and my skin is totally pimple free😅😫
Michelle's face at 2:02 when he said chocolate doesn't make acne worse 😂😂Me too, me too 🍫🍫Chocolate is life tbh
If I have acne around my mouth, I know it's that time of month -_- if I have acne anywhere else... I know it means Ive been lazy with my skin lol

I was so sad to find out that Curology is not available in my state
As soon as David talked about the ingredients that block your pores. I automatically paused the video, and I checked all of my cleansers to see if it have the ingredients that he mentioned. :) :)
Michelle if I live in Canada can I still do the free trial ??
Wait, how come we can have chocolate but not dairy products? When chocolate is made with milk?
I have a huge collection of peppermint tea. Would that work in place of spearmint?
aw its only for the us :(
I need another career talk because i want to make sure I know how to kinda get a good plan even if i don't use it
too bad it's only available in the US :c
chocolate does give u pimples tho... for me it does.. my doctor confirmed it too

No. Not all the milk have hormones. Consult a veterinarian and/or a profesional about that.
HAIR TUTORIAL
GO VEGAN!🍌🍍🍜🌯🐮🐔🐷🔫 stop the acne and animals
I've replaced milk with flax milk (which is almost as delicious). It helped with my adult acne for about a year but I recently had to do a cleansing prep for a colonoscopy so my cystic acne is back full force and wreaking havoc the past few weeks. I've had acne since age 11 off and on (mostly on). It's dreadful to live with and I feel nothing will truly get rid of it. My diet is much improved, my sugar has been replaced with coconut palm sugar, and I've been on birth control for about a decade. What more am I supposed to do?
he looks like Joey graceffa...
any chance the curology treatment is available outside of US? i don't live in america :(
how can i remove my acne scars completely? i am applying facepack given by dematologist but iam not getting expected result.please help me
I don't really drink milk, or eat a lot of dairy, thank god
Very Helpful acne guide “fito shocking plan” (Google it). I am happy I downloaded this one - a fast read with simple to apply acne remedies.  I`ll try some of the tips I read from this guide for my son. This may sound easy, but I think that I`ll be delighted by the results of the small changes.
I'm just wondering why there's 12 year olds asking about how to not make their acne look bad when wearing makeup and what brushes to use..... your a preteen! treat your skin! you're not even old enough for makeup.
ZINC DEFICIENCIES! Go get a blood test or get your hands on liquid zinc and if it does not taste disgusting you are deficient. Magnesium helps with stress and is cooling. Oily skin, use a non clogging facial oil like rose hip oil (also helps with scaring). Avoid if not completely get rid of gluten and dairy and eat low gi and when eating higher gi foods eat it with lots of fibre and a bit of protein. Wash your make up brushes with each use and rotate your pillow each night and wash after two uses. Wear a natural face sun cream everyday and avoid sun exposure on your face. Bentonite clay mask once a month. TRY USE NATURAL PRODUCTS WITH NO ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.
I asked my doctor if dairy causes breakouts and she told me it does not, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and cut out milk and a lot of dairy products and my skin has been seeing so much improvement.
Thank you Dr.!!!
I've already replaced milk with almond milk. :)
Tried to sign up to Curology, but it's only available in the US 😞
2 iPhones 🙏🏿
Mish when r u gonna upload make up videos?And happy birthday!!!!!!!
I love her phone case ngl 😍
Isn't milk very good for your bones? (bc of calcium or something) if i stop drinking it,what can i replace it with in order to grow?
I'm from the uk I can't use the app thing can I? It just says us zip code😭
Im quite surprised that no one has said Happy Birthday to her, so Ill be the first. Happy Birthday!
Guys, Michelle has posted a skin care video so that can help a lot!
US only??? :(((((((
well not eating high-glicemic index food and also not consuming milk is something I tried but it didn't work so that doesn't work for everyone. my acne is way more complex than just changing your diet.
Um I'm not sure if the people saying they want to have his babies are ignoring this, but I think he might be gay...
is this website only available in the states?
It's been a month that I say no to milk products,and say yes to more green vegetables is a big miracles
i have the same pairs of sailor mars socks as you michelle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Weird question. Can someone tell me why couture is a thing that seems like everyone does now? I can see experimenting for fun but do people actually do it on a normal basis?
YAYY MY DREAM JOB IS TO BECOME A DERMATOLOGIST
Acne is simply a genetic condition that certain skin types are prone to. Hormones can trigger it, as can dirty, oily pores getting clogged. THATS IT. Diet has NOT A FREAKING THING to do with acne. This dermatologist is just giving hipsters what they want to hear. The diet thing is a myth. It's been virtually proven.
could you possibly do more tutorials?? thats kinda the reason i started subscribing. Also, i had to cancel tipsy because i have repeatedly done the feedback things and said i didn't want any nail polishes anymore and overtaken the test but i continue to get them!! so frustrating! i wouldn't put on here but i seems like its impossible to get this across on the ipsy website.
That's not how to write 9 in roman numerals
It's not fair you can only get this in the US! Please fix this David!
Great topic! Really helpful.
thanks for this!! I needed it
every time I see this title now I sing "pillow talk" in my head lol
but i like my dairy products and donuts :3
not available in my state yet :(
Yaaas I needed this video
They don't have bad skin BRING ME ON YOUR SHOW
amazing Michelle love u
Does anyone know where Dom is?
😍😍😍😍😍 He's hot
If it's Pillowtalk 9, is it VIV or IX?
Lol he's kinda dreamy!
Is this only a US thing because I'd love to give this a go. Is there anyway to get this product to the UK?
I love cheese too much, I have avoided cows milk for at Least a year now
what tea was it again?
He seemed awkward at times
I'm 14 and I don't have acne
Ok, so I lOVE MILK! Can I still drink almond milk? If I'm thinking about a non-dairy diet things like almond milk would be fine right?
We can all agree that Michelle Phan's videos puts us in such a soothing mood, am I right ?
wtf is wrong with having acne?! why would anyone bully anyone for having acne or a skin condition?! whats wrong with this world really
people will ALWAYS talk. Just choose what you feed your mind ;) love you beautiful!
Whether in real life or on the internet. If some one says something you don't like. No matter how harsh. They have a right to say it. Even if you don't like it or think it is unfair. If you see yourself as some kind of victim. If it harms or hurts you. You are thinking about it too much. Putting too much value in the words of a stranger that doesn't know you, understand you or value you. Today a lot of young people seem to crumble on the weight of others. I suppose I was just raised different. My ma taught me to steel myself. Harden my skin and stand up for myself. She would know. She's one tough lady. Not saying you should argue with people on the internet or nothing like that. What I am saying is when somebody pokes fun at you for something like your looks or your views on life. Remember words only carry as much weight as you give them. Keep a stiff upper lip. At least that is what I think.
Can't see the word pillow talk and not think of Zayn
You can be the ripest, juciest peach in the world, but there is always someone who hates peaches.
I don't know why someone disliked this, this is such a beautiful video.
acne shaming is so horrible, why hate on something that someone has no control over?
Id like to see a pillow talk on dealing with anger and getting into a zen mindset
Could you do pillow talk on self esteem, dealing with your inner critic and knowing how to motivate and succeed without depending on being hard on yourself and bullying yourself internally into fear as a way to focus
Nobody should be shamed for something they have no control over! It says a lot about the character of the bullies that make fun of this kind of stuff, and it's way uglier than acne ever could be.
Acne is beautiful whether you agree  it or not because it makes you you.
My dad always tells me, Not everyone's going to like you, or think your pretty, but always know theres someone who will love you and think your beautiful and be there for you
I've had acne since I was 13 (now I am 27).  I feel you Ashley, you are such a lovely gentle soul!  In a weird way, maybe this happened to you because you would have the strength to stand up and cure the hate for those of us who were to scared to stick up for ourselves.  You are a beautiful soul!
Can you tell how to do this hairstyle Mish? 👌 sorry for grammar mistakes
I've had acne for three years now, and sometimes I can't avoid to feel bad and basically ugly. It's not the worst kind, but it let's you lose confidence. I don't try to hide or conceal them with makeup because I'm still young, and I believe it's natural for my age. It's better for people to get used to you with it, rather than to hide it and shock everyone one day with a bare face. I use an acne lotion to control breakouts, so at least I still do something that doesn't change people's judgment if I wear makeup or not. Bullying will not matter anymore if your strong both inside and out—physical and mentally. This pillow talk and you guys's comments taught me a lot today. Thank you so much!
It's so sad to see people bullying others just because of such unimportant things that everyone can end up having to deal with. Everyone is dealing with their problems and just because you don't have to worry about these issues, it doesn't give you the right to bully him! When people bully others, it says more about the bullies than about the victim. It is like meaningless criticism no one should pay attention to, but it can be difficult not to because that's just how we are. Bullying should stop being a hobby for people. I wish everyone would be more understanding and supportive towards each other! :(
Michelle is so good at these videos! Who else thinks so?
such a helpful and beautiful video mish
Michelle is an inspiration!😍 I love her passion and her videos are AWESOME!☺️💞
People who can only insult people over internet and not in person deserve a potato to the face.
thankyou so much for talking about acne shaming in this video Michelle! I've been through it in high school and that was...horrible
Who else thinks that Michelle is a gift to our world ?
it's so crazy to me that people actually care about these things. THEY ARE SO UNIMPORTANT. 
Like ugh we got bigger fish to fry here, kids. 
Just radiate love.
Isn't it ridiculous that we really judge a person because of acne.
I love this video so much, kisses from france!
I love your pillow talk videos and all the advice i get from it. It really helps, thank you
I really appreciate this video Michelle ❤️ it means a lot to me and many others.
This Argan Rain %100 Pure Argan Oil works quick!! I could tell the next morning that it had already started working and by the 3rd day, my face had cleared up*
You should do a simple hairstyles video. Your hair looks super cute☺️
Awww thank you so much for this wonderful advice! I think we can all learn from this and work on being nicer to each other, especially to other girls. We girls should show each other love and support in any way that we can <3 #curethehate
Michelle is so beautiful, inside and out
Thank you for making this video Michelle. I remember all the bullying in school due to my medical issues (being on dialysis, having a tube hanging out of my chest for it, the scars from surgeries, etc) and it was really hard, but one year I made myself my science project to shore my classmates that no, I'm not contagious, and that what I was going thru was hard and to keep me alive. It was amazing how my classmates opened up and helped me explain everything with the other students who weren't in my class. I just wish people looked at things more closely before opening their mouths with hate.
i really do not understand why you would shame someone for acne, its not like people have control over it. Its not like people aren't self conscious enough about it that you have to point it out.  I just don't simply understand making fun of something like acne....
Hi, I am a young YouTubeur Belgian, who speaks French.
Youtuber the French hate that job ads into their videos, so I'm doing here.
Although no one will understand ... lol
Kiss.

Salut , je suis un jeune YouTuber Belge , qui parle Français. 
Les Youtuber Français déteste qu'on poste des pubs dans leurs vidéos , alors je le fais ici.
Même si personne ne comprendra... lol

La bise.
It doesn't matter that your not pretty even If you are. It matters If you are beautiful on the inside. The people who bully are not beautiful on the inside .
I love how confident the both of you are 💋❤️
thank you so much Michelle Phan I like these Pillow Talk :)
This video really helped me. Thank you!
Hi Michelle, could you put subtitles into your videos please?
This video is so helpful thank you so much <3
I disagree that the internet reflects society. We aren't supposed to know every single thing that other people are thinking. People may be "honest" when they comment on social media but it is a cowardly way of being nasty to others that wasn't available to previous generations. I've always liked the saying, what other people think of me is none of my business.
Wow she is so nice and strong and I wish I could have a big sister like that!
Omg that girl is sooo beatiful!!!
How do you do your hair Michelle it is so majestic 😊💖
Why is she wearing shoes in bed
She is so so so beautiful without makeup😍
this is happening to me right now and this video is hitting home x
i love how positive you two are 😊😍 your voices are soooooo calming and beautiful- i could listen to you two everyday 🙈
love the pillow talks ❤
This helped me a lot. I don't have much acne but people call me "pepperoni pizza". But this helped me to stay confident in my skin. Thank you.
Hey Michelle, any chance we're getting a tutorial some time? :) Thanks for this vid, btw, I liked it.
love these talks that help show us ways to deal with different situation
my emotions sometimes scatter under pressure from others during a day
your talks help so much <3 many thanks
Who else was surprised that michelle phan said a curse word? 😂 Love you Michelle💕💎
this girl bullied me for 6 years and now im her best freind and im getting bullied again but its worse you really helped me thanks
How can anyone dislike this video... They must be very negative people..
Spread positivity and happiness everyone!!!!!!! I hope everyone has had a lovely day today xoxoxo
I love you so much Michelle! Your so inspiring. Love your videos ! 😊💕
awesome pillow-talk video as always! I'm sure you inspire and motivates a lot of young people with your videos
OMG Michelle! I love you! Literally I need you as my best friend like...yesterday!
Iif there is any industry that shames women for their appearance it's the makeup industry. Make up can be great and fun. But let's be real! If women felt comfortable and accepted themselves it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry.
Acne can be caused by something in the bloodstream. If you have cystic acne you should see a doctor to test your blood.
Due to my PCOS I have acne on all of my upper body as well as lots of body hair. It makes me feel ashamed since I don't feel pretty, and I have been bullied for it. But since there's no cure for it I'll have to live with it.
It's hard to stay positive though, and I always feel jealous of other girls who complain about one pimple or that they haven't shaved their legs despite basically not having any hair at all on them. But I try to stay positive, no one is perfect. You rock Ashley, your self-confidence and strength is amazing. And you're beautiful.
I love this!!! Boss @$$ b*tch <3 we all have our own insecurities, skin blemishes is just a cause and effect with our biological states. It doesn't represent who we are, and it is only temporary. We are always working on improving ourselves in every way, and everyone is always trying their best. This is a great video, thank you for making it.
Hello Michelle! Could you please do a hair tutorial for this look? It's amazing 😱😛
Michelle needs her own talkshow :)
Thanks so much for sharing ! I'm a victim of all 3 / I feel so relieved now ! <3
em youre the cutest, this helps a lot.
Michelle please do more amsr videos! Your voice is absolutely calming and relaxing to listen to <3
Wow, people can be so terrible. I wonder who these people are, hiding behind their screens and phones. Probably they wish they had a better life and struggle with a lot of things too. I never wrote any mean stuff like this and I never will because I truly believe that positivity helps us to overcome any obstacle in life. We need to EMPOWER one another and just be there if someone needs help♥♥♥  It could be so easy, yet there are sweet girls like Ashley who experience such cruel things. :( Thanks you for the video!!! BIG HUG!!
Michelle, you have grown to be such a beautiful and inspiring person. Thanks for being who you are.
nice video!can you do a hair tutorial,michelle?thanks
I like how calm both of yoy beautiful women in this video <3 spead love <3
Never thought acne shaming was actually a thing till now  ... I go to work everyday thinking if I should cover up the acne or not , it's not something I can avoid and I just wish people would  understand that .
I know your channel is mainly about makeup and inspiration, but can you do some hair tutorials as well? I really love your hair :)
This is my favorite type of her, this help me so much. Thanks. #lovepillowtalks
Michelle you are such an inspiration for me ❤️ ty
Ashley seems to be such a sweetheart! loved this video!

michelle you continue to inspire people like me thank you so much for the things that you are bringing to the world .
People who didn't like this video are not humans 👍🏼
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MICHELLE!!!
Acne Bullying!!! Oml Acne is a struggle😭😭
Thank you for those advice, you're always helpful and it's great and relaxing to watch! <3 love u
2 words about  you  : kind and confident
U both r really inspiring 
Very innovative
Hat's off Michelle.....lots of love ♥
So early😱❤️michelle you are the most beautiful person❤️
such an inspirational pillow talk!! love you so much Michelle<33
to the person who asked how to be confident with adult acne in college: I'm currently in same position as you and I wore makeup before to hide it but I realised that I'm much more confident with my bare face than with makeup. honestly one day I just stopped wearing makeup for no particular reason and people didn't really change their behaviour towards me. i always try to be confident even when I dont feel like it. it is all about accepting your flaws and not paying too much attention to it. people will always get drawn to your positive energy than get turned off by your acne. 
stay strong and positive 😊
this video is absolutely beautiful 💕 I can honestly say that this helped me a lot . also the editing on this video I'd quite nice . also does anybody know the outro song to the video ?
Sorry for off topic, but Michelle your hair is on point, can we have a hair tutorial of it?😍
THESE VIDEOS GIVE ME SO MUCH INSPIRATION❤️❤️THANKS MICHELLE❤️❤️❤️
People are jerks who do this & honestly everyone's beautiful 💕🙏🏼
I hate acne bullying or most any kind of skin related bullying because it's something people can't help and can be tricky to hide. My boyfriend has a lot of acne scars and to this day he feels like "the ugly one" or "the troll I'm stuck with" even 4 years of being together and that's because of bullying he's received online and in real life. But it blows my mind how casually cruel people can be to people for their skin. ive seen a baby born with a skin condition and the comment section calling it a monster... To an actual newborn baby. Basically people are cruel and I don't know why, but what I do know is there's also people like yourselves who do promote positivity, confidence and kindness and that shines through anyone's face
Loved this xx How did you do your hair? It's so pretty 💗
Tyler Clementi Foundation!! I loved you had mentioned that, more people should know about his story and continue spread the message of his foundation!

If you're reading this:




You are beautiful and don't let anybody bring you down 💗 YOU ARE PERFECT IN EVERY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM 😍
She is beautiful! And so are you, Michelle! Good work!
I like to remember a coco Chanel quote when I'm being bullied for acne. 
"I don't care what you think of me, I don't think of you at all"
michelle is my girl crush
Needed this right now. Love you, Michelle.
Michelle I just love the help and positive vibes you create! Thank you!

The Internet is not here for people to judge other people. Only judge yourself. The Internet is surrounded by negativity, but only you can make it positive.
One nice comment could make someone else's day! （＾ω＾）
i totally cant listen to mean people ,, i do 2 things ,
1 totally ignored them .
2 block them
Inspiring as always. Thank you!!
+MichellePhan thanks i was cyber bullied and  this really helped ilysm and thxx
I love the pillow talk vids also can you pls do a tutorial on your hair?
I'm a middle child so I know how it feels to worry about the younger sibling and worrying that they'll be bullied. I mean I was bullied and made fun of because of my older sibling and that kind of made the course of how I would eventually deal with things and develop a personality and stuff, so I ended up acting a certain way so that I would seem a great person so that I wouldn't be a reason my sibling would be bullied.
You are doing great. Thanks for being who you are and thanks for just being how you are.
You are so relaxing and peaceful💕
great video!😍😍
BEST YOUTUBER EVER😍🙌🏽
as long as you love yourself, that is all that will ever matter💖
Anyone else miss makeup tutorials??? Love you Michelle💖
You have such a positive influence in my life, and help me want to be better! You're the best 💖
Both so beautiful, acne goes away and either way you're great and your personality shines through everything!

Can you do a pillow talk on relationships please? Topics like advice on how to have better communication between each other, resolving issues that arise, crossing boundary lines and taking the next step in the relationship and approaching that type of conversation with one another. Also about how to keep the relationship feeling fun and not dull or too comfortable. Love you michelle! <3 You're a role model for me and I turn to your videos when I need some inspiration and comfort as well as advice! <3

Can you explain how you make comics? And how did you came up with the story😩🙏🙏🙏I want to start a comic om Webtoon too
#pillowtalk I had a friend who started being realy mean and saying horrible things to me and my friends, but when we confronted her about it she told everyone we were bullying her. We tried to be nice about it but now everyone else in our year (grade) has been angry and mean to us for "bullying" her. I know making an enimy of her is not going to help  but I just don't know what to do. What others think doesn't bother me but it realy upsets my friends.  please help love you❤
I love you Michelle! You're videos are awesome 🙌🏾💯❤️
Omg I love her! She sounds so nice and sweet 💕
Jeez it's just acne. Acne shaming is just blasphemous. what's wrong with the world.
If u are suffering with acne try Exposed SKin CAre it worked for me!!! #notspondered but def helped me clear my skin!! I urge anyone to try it!!!
Great topic! Thanks Michelle & Ashley!
Your room is so beautiful xx

Loved the video, as always Michelle! It's was really eye opening and touching. And I was wondering when are you going to upload a makeup tutorial? I miss them. +MichellePhan
STOP BEING SO PERFECT ☆ﾐ
I've been on a constant battle with acne for as long as I can remember. It definitely brings down my confidence, but luckily I haven't gotten bullied for it.... that I know of. But I always feel like people are staring at it and judging me in the back of their minds >.<
I lovee you so muchh you are so inspiring❤️❤️
this video is amazing 😊 you girls are inspiring 💕
Love this video. I love the fact that you are confronting the issues on social media and taking questions and answering how to cope with cyber bullying
the people were just jelouse that u had the courage to post the pic
This is awesome. I really needed it!
I know this sounds SUPER petty, but it happens. Before in primary school, I was super confident, I would be known as the happy, confident Asian/English girl who would try and make people smile but since I've moved to high school (A different one from my whole class since I moved house) I feel super lonely and less confident, and now I just feel self conscious of how I look. I have friends and all, but I feel super lonely with no one who understands me. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about personal stuff or just cry (See petty), before in Primary School I could just cry or tell someone when I was upset about my dad passing away, but now, I feel like I have to bottle it up. And, I am always so self conscious of how I look. I feel like I look like an Asian Potato with a really long fringe. And, he is the pettiest problem ever, I don't know what style to put my hair in, since I'm in England and it's always windy, my hair just goes everywhere. This makes me anxious of how I look, and honestly, it really makes me feel nervous. I just wish I could be back in primary. :( Any advice on how to overcome these problems (And don't say hairspray for the second one, already tried)..
Hair tutorial pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!
the funny thing is that i freaking loved her face without makeup! istg it looks so SO PRETTY
Happy B-day Mish<3
Gurl! You're so close to ten million subscribers!🎊🎁🎉🎈
You're outlook is really inspiring. I'm so sorry you had to go through all that cyber bullying.
Ashley, you are absolutely gorgeous! You are too Michelle and thank you both for sharing your views and gifts with the world. I have talked to multiple young adults that didn't experience acne in high school, but are experiencing it now. You are brave and setting an example for others.
Hi Michelle! Thanks for the tips!
I love that you are using your platform to stand up for the vulnerable :)
I love these videos so much  !!! One of my favourite videos you make .💜🌌
I love u so much Michelle 😘
We have those emoji pillows in my store 😂
Ashley's voice is so calming and peaceful 😌 loved this video
she seems so sweet. and everyone has acne or had it once so I'm having a hard time understand why it's a reason to attack someone for
The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. Proverbs 12:18
you are beautiful ❤
Thank you for this video I feel much better because I am being cyber bullying
Omg I got every thing that I want to hear about cyber bullying
This is really off-topic, but did she ever make a tutorial of how she did the decoration over her bed? My native tongue is not English so I do not know what the name is for that thing in English. Just to clarify, I mean the thing hanging over her bed, which is usually used to keep mosquitoes out/away. 

And regarding bullying, I try to not let things get to me. I have the power to NOT let their comments affect me. They can say whatever they want, but how it affects me is on me. Their words mean nothing to me, as they do. I don't give them the light of day. And I am not saying that is easy. But if you keep letting those words affect you, you can barely live without negative thoughts.
Love  you Michelle!! 💕💕 🇩🇴🇬🇧 xx
This video means a lot to me thanks so much for doing it 
At the start of this year a girl started bullying me and cyber bullying me so it means a lot thanks so much
Love ya Michelle watched u since I was 3 but I was wondering how do u deal with tough times and still try to be happy

I don't even think her acne is that bad, she is actually really beautiful with and without makeup and shouldn't be judged either way xx
pillow talk means having a conversation after having sexual intercourse...
her pillow talk videos calm me down
hi mish your hair is beautiful. i would like to know how to do
both are beauties OMG
Ashley's beautiful. With or without acne. Same goes for Michelle. Same for everybody. Everybody is wonderfully and beautifully made.
michelle phan....michelle...


PHAN!
I can't believe people still do this its so dumb you look pretty any way with glasses,acne and more. and it's so annoying if someone is bullying you because people look at themselves and they say they are right because they try to make you fell bad about yourself to make themselves  feel better.i think that people need to feel confident in themselves and they need to love themselves it makes you feel better and even if you dont think you look pretty they shouldn't judge you on your looks they should judge you on nothing.listen we don't want your opinions we have our own opinions our personality and how we see things is how we are beautiful. I think it's so dumb that people are 
Making videos that are like the prettiest girl on earth or the ugliest girl ever it doesnt matter we our are own person no matter what you call us we still believe in are selves you can't bring us down you shouldn't be ashamed of your self you should be proud of what you accomplished so go outside and rock what your wearing just know to be confident in you self:)
I miss your make up tutorials 😢
Michelle I love your hair in this vid!! Can you please do a tutorial on it?? It's super gorgeous ^_^
Ashley said "like" 68 times (yes, I was bored..)
Hey Mish, what's your hair color? I love it so much 💗
Third comment :)
she is so sweet her voice is so calm
their talk is good but very theoretical .. we can't apply it in real life
i love Michelle's hair on this. Hairstyle video pretty plz plz plz!!!
omg that happens to me so many time. like its unbearable but not for acne, for my figure shape I am little bit chubby and those damn people make so much fun of me and it feels like go and jump from the rooftop but very next minute I realise that this figure, this shape of body, this face  are not maded by you..... Yeah YOU little damn people. it's god gifted. well I don't have to explain you. my silence is enough to explain actually.
"it could always be worse" is what i think when i am feeling down...
Michelle you are such a peaceful and gentle person your presence is just very calming and soothing to me. Just your voice and what you say just makes me feel relaxed and calm so thankyou ♥️💕💘❣👑💝😍
It's such a shame that people are bulling someone for their acne. Like Ashley said: it's just acne. Skin problem doesn't define someone's personality. Great video and it's so nice to see people who are doing great things on Internet :) xoxo
I've never seen that picture before I just want to let you know your beautiful and don't let anyone drag you down keep your head help high
Booooriiinnnnggg!!!
you are such an inspiration woah x
Michelle I miss you and ur videos 💓
Michelle always makes my heart stop because I'm so overwhelmed by her aura. She's just so admirable and a role model. I hope I could meet you someday. Love you, Michelle.
"Time is limited, tomorrow is not promised, but today is..what I can do today can affect tomorrow and build a better promised tomorrow.." I love that
Room goals!😍 And this video is very good!👍
I will scream if Michelle replys
i stoped and im gonna try this
Michelle, your videos are seriously the best advices anyone can get. you're an inspiration to the world. I love you. I respect you. XOXO

Thank you very much for this beautiful video. Regardless of our right to say what we feel inside, we should try to put ourselves in other people's shoes, try to envision what it's like to have someone hurt your feelings. We are all different but deep down I know that we are all connected to one another. We all should also be sensitive to other people's feelings. Namaste
This video helped me a lot, thank you xxx 😪
Tomorrow's her birthday, April 11
One of the things I love about Michelle is that how precise she is with her words/advices/videos, life lessons in 5 sentences! Yo go Phan
:T i dont like cyber bullys....
When I first saw the topic, I thought they're gonna sing 'pillow talk'
you and her are absolutely beautiful
I've been watching Michelle since 2009 and I can't believe how much she has grown! I can relate so much to her, we are like the same person (well we were born on the same date)! Keep up the good work Michelle! I love you so much! ♥♥♥
Michelle's voice is so soothing and relaxing
Oh my gosh is she just sitting there with shoes?!

How to stop cyberbullying 
close laptop and phone
Coming from a perfectionist here. Eventually you will get tired of worrying about your acne and the comments you receive from people. Instead I just focus on things that make me happy and healthy. I avoided friends that would joke about my skin and stick with your true and empathetic friends. Coincidentally, my skin got better. I personally think worrying about your skin can make it worse. 
Sad to say this but acne doesn't go away overnight. You just have to be consistent with happiness and health.
Haters  make me feel like I am doing something right...
so nice of you to do this <3
I MISSED U
Wahh iloveyou michelle!! 😍😍😘
Pls do more makeup tutorial... ☺☺
Can someon pleasse tell me how she did this hairstyle or please tell me how is this call???😩 It's so frckinn prettyyy
Hye Mish! Im so excited for your next pillowtalk. I  have a crush at my school. I always feel that I shouldn't tell him what I felt. Do you think I should tell or I shouldn't? Thank You! 😘
I love you so much you speak the truth
PILLOW TALK MY ENEMY and MY ALLY
is it just me but WHY IS SHE WEARING SHOES ON THE BED
Can you do a tutorial on your makeup in this video?
Stop cyber bullying!!!
So early 😄
her voice is so relaxing
People should hate on the things that is worth hating for, such as wars and other serious problems that impacts ALL of us. Not on someone's physical appearance.
what do you call her hairstyle?? it's so pretty! 😭
😘❤️
can u show us how to do that hairstyle and also the tutorial or products u used on ur face
Ashley is beautiful! People are crazy to acne shame her. smh. You're awesome Ashley. :)
SO EARLY
You have such a beautiful heart Michelle.
This is such a beautiful video
People saying Before  someone think about your self first that if someone says u like that then how would you feel ... how can someone be like that .. Respect everyone value and everthing
Why would you dislike this video, this is beautiful
She is beautiful just the way she is
Thanks a lot for this video, I'm dealing with acne since I'm 13 (and I'm 20), it's horrible. I tried everything, from changing my way of eating to my contraception, nothing is working. But everyday, I'm fighting against myself to love me even with this problem I have. We are not ugly, we are just differents, please everyone, love yourself! :)
love ur videos so much
The world needs more people like her. #PositiveThinking
Why don't u do makeup anymore I missed the old Phan iam steal ur 1 One fan steal ❤️ ur video it inspires a lot of people

Michelle is the best person in the world. She has a great comunication, she's very nice, she's funny, she does everything perfectly. I just love her so much and I love her videos. =)💛💛💛💛💛💛
How does she do that hair?? I love it so much, can you please do a tutorial on it? <3 xoxo
love this vid
my teacher pointed out my acne to the whole class once
Michelle Phan, Please Please Please continue to make makeup tutorials cause that's why millions of your subscribers want to see, can you see the number of viewers on your latest videos is low!
please I am and I am sure a lot of people agree with me about this, do more makeup tutorials and reviews and looks and challenges...
I'm going to a psychologist for the first time tomorrow after being diagnosed with depression. A lot of the joy in my life is often taken away because of my depression. Yet, your videos are one of the very few things that still bring me some joy. You and yoyr videos literally mean so much to me. Thank you, Michelle. You have a beautiful soul and I wish you all the best
Oil Pulling will remove acne.
I used to hate my face because I'm acne prone myself. Eventually, I realized that acne is a temporary thing that we can't always control, but the bottom line is that it's only temporary surface blemishes that don't truly define the person underneath. ❤️
I've had a really bad day, but this video makes me feel MUCH better. Thank you so much :)
okay, so if we like talking about acne then you guys should of wore no makeup to show us the confidence  we need
i clicked on it and thought it was the song pillow talk;)
11th comment
Named after Zayn Malik's Song Pillow Talk
where can i find the background music??

I use Korean product
I miss you Michelle😢
Very beautiful, very smart, very nice ❤️
❤️❤️❤️You are the best lu u... Michelle.......
This makes me so sad. ;(
INDIA loves u MISH ! we ALL do !!! <3 <3 <3
I love this
do a hair tutorial on your hair in this video? :)
Can you make the subtitles please?
hi mish I am a big fan
I have to say this
I love you Mish
I would love to hear your thoughts on social media expectations. Seems like a hot topic these days.
Yaaaas I'm early
how did you do your hair? i really like it! :-)
I'm currently still suffering from my acne scarring. it's been so long 😭
I have such bad acne and there are like no other girls in my year with acne that's really noticeable and it's really awkward and I can't do anything about it
Love this video...Michelle you are so nice....
передёрнул на тебя девочка!
Honestly this helped me so much Michelle. As a sophomore in high school I've recently been getting acne shamed by people I'm acquainted with and teased for covering half of my face when I'm not doing anything. This became a subconscious habit of mine because  of how insecure I am with my face and how I look. Yet, I contradict myself by not wearing makeup because I don't feel its right to give in to their teasing and hide my insecurities. Now I never will give in to them. Thank you for teaching me to love myself Michelle, when nobody else would.
Love from guam
It really sucks that this happened to her, she seems like such a sweet and genuine person! I've been dealing with acne for awhile too so I get the struggle.
I know it's like a really important theme and stuff but her thumbnails just look so silly
Omg I love michelle
403rd view <3
i cant believe you were this brave to open up,well done to both girls and you can do whatever you want to do you can be whoever,whatever and whenever dont  let your dreams be dreams


JUST DO IT!
good video keep doing  more
the one thing I think about to boost my self confidence is to remind myself to stop caring and focusing so much on my physical appearance, instead remind myself that I am a beautiful person inside and that I shouldn't conceal that beautiful energy and my true self due to any physical insecurities that can seriously debilitate your self esteem and how you reflect yourself onto others, the world and your perspective of the world .  it's like don't let yourself and others miss out on the beauty that is you, it's unfair and a loss to you and the world.
3rd haha soooo happy
I love pillow talk
Pls do a tutorial of your hair michelle!!
This is a great video, I found the background music a little distracting though.
I love you Mish! <3
Great advise and tips it's really sad ppl have to go out their way to bully someone online
I love u pillows where did u get them
Mish, please show me how to forgive your enemy
I had acne and i changed my eating habits. def helped!
Michelle you're beautiful and thank you for inspiring all of us. You are helping us go through the tough times, so thank you.
Can we stop with the pillow talk and trend reports? I've been waiting for a new makeup tutorial video from you for about 2 months.
Thats so true u r amaizing michelle i love u give me so much strength and advice u were the first youtuber i had ever watched and u r so inspring U R THE BEST thank u so much for helping through rough times u always make me smile!❤️❤️❤️
stop at 6:45
Thank you for sharing this! I have cystic acne and was teased for it in Middle School. So I totally feel for Ashley! Thank you for standing up and not tolerating that negativity. I have always been self conscious....but I have learned that I am beautiful no matter what other people might think of my skin. I think you're beautiful Ashley!
Damm she is soo gorgeous even with the acne. I don't get why people would bully people like her. Like do they feel better after it?
And I've not really heard why you're not putting new things out there but I really hope you have plans to relaunch. I love your videos, I miss how frequently you used to upload hair tutorials and make up tutorials and I miss all of the skin care vids but j understand you're a busy woman. You've been my favorite beauty guru from the start and you always will be I just hope you know through all the negativity and hate there's still people out here who love you. 
-Mary Alex
I would shame her for wearing shoes in bed instead, gross
Thinking about it I've never seen people's acne as ugly, It's always just kind of blended into the rest of their face for me
Beauty comes from the inside not from the outside
They say "wash your face" But you wash your face everyday :/
i love you
i can defeat cyber bullying but what about real bullying in schools?
You inspire me
she's gorgeous.
Where I live, in Switzerland, there are many people not knowing much about fashion or make up. So, while in other coutries girls start to use make up when they are 12, here it's really unusual to see young girls, even teenagers, having make up on every day. A little bit mascara, maybe eyeliner and rarely a lipstick, that's basically it. A little more, like a more intense eye makeup or a darker lipstick, on big events but no big deal still. This way nobody really judges if someone has acne because barely anyone covers it up. I think this is a good thing, because you basically grow up with natural looking people and don't judge them. It's more that people would judge someone's make up rather than their acne.
Another thing, I don't judge people for such things because they usually can't do much about it. Most people have a really long time covering it up and trying to fix it and when it finally calms down you still see the scars. Besides, if someone covers it with make up and can basically make it disappear, why is it so terrible if they have that acne under the make up? You get to know people not because of what they look like but because of who they are. And if a good person stands in front of you, what do you care if she or he has acne? You'd like or even love them still the same and you'd totally ignore these unimportant little obstacles like acne.
Yes I love these videos
hey she was on that syfy show! I think it's called The Internet ruined my Life
That's was nice but I was bothered that she had her shoes on while in bed😒. Other than that I  enjoyed watching
Yeah, every time I see a meme about a real person I always think about how it can hurt them. It's sad :(
Your hair
michelle is goal 💗
Clap Clap
Zayn copied ''pillowtalk'' from Michelle.😜
love all your videos!
Music name?? :*
I love your videos. May I ask a question?  Are you related to Promise Phan?
I love you
Please do makeup tutorial. I don't like video like that
Where can I send in questions for Michelle to consider in her next pillow talk?? Anyone?
I've been through this I'm 1 month clean of cutting
a troll came in our Facebook group one time we are a group or women who have miscarried and we are discussing how to cope. some jerk said to me "haha I'm glad your homosexual baby died"  I just took it calmly and said "we all die eventually hopefully when it's your time you will remember what you said today". It hurt a little because it was a recent loss and I did not know people waste their time on one troll comment
Thank you Michelle for this pillow talk featuring Ashley:) I deal with adult acne too and I often have people inbox me messages like, "your skin is damaged, you shouldn't be doing beauty videos and have a beauty channel, you have some sort of skin disease" and worse. while these come from people entitled to their opinions, I give it no attention. I create videos that I have strong interest in, this gives me intention, purpose and fulfillment.. I say this to myself whenever I need a boost to my confidence. this pillow talk served to be very informative, thank you once again!!
Who misses the old Michelle?
Aww 💘
You're so inspriring...
today is my birthday turn 16 yeeey
Lmao just block them
que paso con los subtitulos 😭😭😭😭
love the video
I miss your videos :(((( I am wondering how long I have to wait for you to make new videos ^^ Love you, my idol <3

Michelle can make me laugh when I can't even smile. Love you Michelle. ♥︎♥︎♥︎ And who ever reads this, have a good day. Your beautiful.♥︎♥︎♥︎

beautiful video :)
I am so sorry for you
Thanks for making this video I really find it helps! Can you make a video on how to cover up your acne😊🙂
damn zayn where u at
People are so brave when they hide behind their computer screen ...
I love jou
you may have acne... but you are truly one of the most beautiful girls I have ever laid eyes on. true beauty, as a high school students you've helped me so much and I will spread your campaign:)
no 5565 view
People can be so rude don't let that go to your mind be nice and ignore everybody else's aways be happy 😀😀😀😍😍😍😍
love you
awesome video. sending loads of love and light to bith of you. xx
i love both of you
Can you make a video about how you do this hairstyle?-
ive had acne for 10 years now. i just turned 23 yesterday. im totally traumatized by my skin and i now have BDD and am constantly suicidal. my whole face is blanketed in scars and makeup doesnt cover anymore. its just a nightmare. ive done everything i could
😭
cyber bullying doesnt even seem to b thing. just ignore it. real life bullying is worse cuz in most cases u cant get away from it.
+Michelle Phan I am a victim of bullying, my classmate on my school steal from me, call me names, blame me, always tell my secrets to everyone😔. Can you make a Pillow talk video about BULLYING?
Te sigo desde hace mucho tiempo, desde los videos que hacias desde tu habitación, que alegría ver como has crecido..
That's so good of you to help people who r going through cuber bullying. You can go to a dermatologist and they can recommend products for you and for your skin.
I agree
Can anybody tell me the song she uses in her outro? It sounds so beautiful and I would love to hear the full song!
Opinions are different from hate comments. An opinion is like "I respectfully disagree..." not "You're completely wrong!" 
      Always remember to be nice. Kindness is key. People have feelings too, and you can truly damage them if you say something mean. Always remember that and never forget it. You might think that saying something rude on the internet won't mean anything, but it really does. Even if it doesn't impact you particularly, it srill does to some other people. So please don't comment anything mean because, when you think about it, it really doesn't do much for you in the long run.
I'm almost 29 and still battle cystic acne. It went away for a year then came back with full force a few weeks ago following a colonoscopy due to the cleanse I had to do, just like after my first one a year and a half ago.
you should do a video with your mom i reallly  would want to see you mom
Cyber bully or any type of bully is just a way of life. My best friend betrayed me once and started telling rumours to like people in school. I started getting bullied and never have I ever think about committing suicide. If they say anything about you just leave them, it's their mouth anyway. I suffered from pistanthrophobia because of cyber bully and I'm still fighting against it. Don't think too much, just don't. It'll hurt you mentally and physically. What I suggest is do your favourite thing on your free time instead of going on social media. I love gymnastics, thats what I love so whenever I feel down, I just start stretching and do gymnastics. Nobody can stop me from doing that. Now, I'm so much more stronger. I might be alone sometimes but at least I know that I won't die if somebody hurts me again.
I have acne and I can relate to this. Some people just don't have perfect skin.
BIG LOVE !!! <3 <3 <3
This is such a beautiful video. Why would you dislike this?
I read HELIOS:FEMINA and its is really good manga, it's like  sailor moon  :)
I am only a kid and I have many pimples....... I get asked lots of questions like " what is that on your face" or "pimple face" or "why do u have so many pimples?" No one else in my school has acne but me.....😓
going vegan helped my acne so much I went from a full face of red to an almost clear face with the occasional pimple x
LOVE HER PILLOW TALK AND TREND REPORTS.
Loved it
I love ur channel
Song reference
I get bullied where ever I go.
happy birthday mish
where is the pillow between Ashley and michelle?
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 😙😘😚😘😙
Dear Michelle,
I've been a huge fan of yours for about 7 years. My mom is not very girly and she never taught me how to use makeup or how to do my hair so when I started getting interested in those things I took to YouTube. You were one of the first beauty gurus I fell in love with. You were so passionate about your makeup and you taught me how to properly use makeup as well as how to properly remove it and take care of my skin. I trusted everything you recommended and believed every bit of advice you gave to me. So as you started to grow I found myself getting a bit jealous because all of the people I recommended you to before who said they weren't really impressed were now flocking to your videos and talking about how great you were. Fast forward to your make up line and you'll find me with eyes glued to my computer screen just wishing so badly I could get my hands on something in your line and low and behold my mom bought me a life pallet and contour stick for Christmas. (Thrs more)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MICHELLE ❤️❤️❤️
can you talk about friends please i mean loosing a friend
I love the vibe of all of her vids
Can you talk about people not understanding your ideas, critique, prejudice, trying everything and depression
i got bullied before       and im a kid im 10 years old
Good talk ! I can't take my eyes off of those shoes on the bed tho .......
I feel people are shamed with or without acne society is so different now and everyone is just trying to fit in.
In seventh grade my acne was the worst, and everyday in third period this girl would sit across from me and reply things about it and say, Oh I'm connecting the dots in your forehead. My acne has gone down considerably and I'm in the tenth grade now. My acne is to the point where it's little to none. But last year, I wore no make-up one day to school and a guy came up to me and told me to put on makeup. Now Tbh I can't go out into public w/o makeup and not feel self conscious, so I wear makeup where ever I go, except when I don't have company.
Who knows the name of that song playing at the beginning? Michelle really have great taste in music
Im glad more people are promoting anti bullying, so i hope their will be more love and frienships.
y do people judge people   with acne if they could get it too
Pls, somebody tell me what is Michelle's hairstyle called?
How to get rid of acne?
I know this is late but happy birthday day is it on April 11 tell me is it right anyway Happy Birthday love your view😘☺😉😇
whoever bully people regardless, is a shallow people.
Remember kids, our freedom of speech allows us to speak our minds, but it doesn't protect hate speech ✌
How to act with your first boyfriend?
michelle can you please do a pillow talk on depression , low self-esteem,suicidal thougts and family problems
Is cyber bullying even real? like dude close ur eyes look away from the screen lmao
heyyy
michelleeeeeë
Michelle do you remember when you cyber bullied a teenager on Twitter? #hypocrite
Acne shaming pisses me off so much !!!
WHAT A ZIT
Alrighty then I'm going to kill myself nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Michelle should be a counselor lol
Love the video!
when I was in the 8th grade a guy that sat next to me asked me "hey do you like choclate?" and I said "yea!" because I thought I was going to be offered some but then he said "No wonder" and I was so confused and asked "what do you mean" and he said "well you have a lot of acne" and he laughed, and honestly for him it might have seemed as a joke but it hurt me and the fact that he laughed at my insecurity, at my face, it really made me feel bad. I tried to laugh it off but till this day because of that simple moment I have been very insecure about my face.
the underlying cause of bullying, majority of us comes from dysfunctional or abusive families which can be manifestation of insecurities that we subconciously adapt to cope
Happy birthday Michelle!
I was rejected, dumped, bullied and everything else just for having acne. I've always had low self esteem because of this and other reasons of course.
the haters think skin makes you ugly, it's your features, and you have really nice features so youre beautiful !!
I love this video.
I don't have acne but I loved watching this video!!!  Confidence is one of the most important things in life. The abundance or lack thereof can make or break you.  This made me realise we should always see the good in people and let them know we see this good side of them, and we should never let anything/any,one trample our confidence. This may sound funny, but when I feel down, I listen to Tom Petty's song "I won't back down." And it ALWAYS lifts me up. :-D Thank you for this video Michelle and thank you Ashley Vampevenage, you're both VERY VERY beautiful!
I'm beeing cyberbulllied right now and it won't stop
Michelle, love your hairstyle, it's super cute!!!!!!!;) p.s. who cares what mean people think of you, the most important is that you are you! and you  are unique!  you have to love yourself and embrace your best qualities! <3
Beautiful
I am Korean! But I like you video♥
There should be so many likes one this
people who be to each other tgere are haters dont listen to them they are just jealous.They are just mad because you are the one whos beautiful.They are just mad because they are not beautiful your the who is beautiful.#believeinyourself
Negative people shouldn't matter to you. As long as you think of yourself as beautiful then that's all that matters.
I didn't know Ashley, she reminded me of #SabrinaSpellman :-)
I'm sure she already knows but, just in case, there's make up for skins with acne, in Buenos Aires we got #Asepxia brand which also sells soaps and other products. Also try washing make up brushes, pillows, towells (everything that touches your skin), very often, you may have sensitive skin.
I have Akne too and i have no Make-up and i am Lucky 😜👍🏻
LIFE is too short to be mean. Go out there and touch someone's LIFE in a POSITIVE WAY, you will feel good about yourself!
i loved this video!
❤️❤️
Her voice 😍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
wonderful video! :-D
I think zain malik was inspired by the name of this I don't like him sorry guys
Bullying and hate, spread pain and hate. No one has the right to bully anyone.
toodlers are way nicer they say "you have an owie?" then want to make me feel bettrr
does anyone know how Michelle does her hair here or what it is called?
I love this video. I used to have a lot of acne too, but now I grow a few here and there. It is more of a scar now sadly, but I used to feel insecure about it and think about what people will say or think about my face. When they look at me it feels like they are looking at my acne, but of course they are since it is right at my face too hahaha but I went out and showed it off no matter how I felt. I never covered them because I know that no one is perfect and we all have our insecurity. We just have to learn how to be confidence in all of our flaws : ) It just takes time for everyone.
That has happened to me I get it
I  know this might not be you'r style, but can you please make a makeup tutorial of Harley Quinn from the upcoming movie Suicide Squad ?...
Hi
Michelle I hate to tell you this but in the beginning of the video at 0.10 no one said a bad thing in the commons actually was all positive and encouragement and good things lol
How is cyberbullying a thing like just walk away from the computer
The one thing that comes to my mind when I look at people on the street is "why all of you have such clear skin and I'm the one sticking out with my acne?"
Finding others with problem same or even worse than mine makes me feel a little bit better but honestly I don't like this way of cheering myself up. Sometimes I look for people with similar features on the street, on Instagram, youtube, as if some part of me wishes to find a clue how to be a better version of myself. How to find and embrace the things that make us different instead of longing for what's not meant for us? The funny thing is we need to see others to do so to feel like we are allowed to be who we really are. How am I supposed to work on my personality if don't even let it show? As I'm reading what I said I'm thinking that if I made sit down talking videos I'd probably would film something on that subject. ANYWAYS, I loved the new video - as always. This is my favorite channel on Youtube ✨
Where did you get your emoji pillows?
These videos are so calming to hear and look at. The colors in the backround make me want to fall asleep
I had acne for a long time. It was a really difficult time in my life. It hurts so I always knew it was there and every time I met someone new I knew that they were looking at my face and making some kind of judgement. So many people would make comments on it as though they thought I had no idea that it was a problem. Strangers on the train, kids at the store, everyone had advice. Now that my skin is better, a lot of people have told me how much more beautiful I am, because apparently I couldn't be beautiful with acne. The people who gave me advice for my skin are always trying to figure out what fixed it because they want to take credit for my skin. It may be trivial to people outside of the world of acne but the whole experience really shaped who I am today.
Yeah. Third comment.
Luv u
great message! my heart dropped once when I read multiple comments where Amber Walter referred to Brye Ashley as Skeletor. Brye has shared her battle with an eating disorder a few times. She also chose to label her Skeletor in the description box of one of her videos. Disturbing to say the least! She also stated in a video that adult entertainers have no feelings and its difficult to hurt their feelings?
Michelle, what do you do if you want to stand up for you and your friends.Because when I try to say something I'm afraid of being hurt. And public speaking, I have a little speech impediment and I'm afraid of people judging me.
we were born on same daayy 😆😆😆
she wear shoes on the bed?
Ily
Sometimes I wonder how people like Michelle or Marzia keep their lives so in order.
Michelle is getting a lot less view than most channels with this many subscribers are expected to have.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
makeup tutorial please...
Nice video
I have a lot of acne and one of my best viewed videos about it on my channel, I couldn't share on Twitter or Instagram because I was scared boys will make the 'take a girl swimming in a first date' joke but this video was so uplifting!💛💛💛

To me, freedom of speech doesn't mean you can say the most outrageous things and it will be okay. You're just simply being a very rude person. And that's not okay.
I want her room so bad so. Cute
even i had acne and i used to be heart broken when my classmate make a talk about it !. but what i learned from all these was that people who were trying to drag me down was already below me!
your acne will likely clear up if you cut out all animal products especially dairy.
What's Michelle's hairstyle called?
I loveeee the ending from 08:58 till the end its soo calming and soothing. Am i the only one?
Cyber bullying doesn't exist lmao,just block the people who are 'bullying' you.Or just get off your phone :/
Omg I'm reading Helios femina
I brought a backless prom dress because I want to get over my bacne scarring and to be more confident
How do you tell your crush you like them 😭😭😖
how do you deal with everyone hating you, not because of something that you did,but because you're different
Social media is full of superficiality. If your gonna show your true colors, you gotta be tough and ready because negative comments is inevitable.
I hate ppl sometimes because of things like bullying
why even bother about haters? do what u want and just let 'em talk shit! they want yer attention: if u react, they get what they want!
Michelle, I don't normally follow blogs / vlogs, but you're the only one! I am so happy for the community you've created to support other women of any age. Women should give strength to each other, and in general people are designed to live together, so they should help each other develop better ourselves. And this is exactly how you are, and your inner beauty shows outside, you're a beautiful woman <3
Cyber bullying is terrible bullying in general is terrible it hurts 😔
Even ppl say i look bad without makeup my darkcircles and all and i feel so bad
I have acne and a very oily skin despite my skin care, but I honestly don't give 2 shits about it. I've always failed to understand why it was such a big deal to people
You can face anything and you will overcome bullying.  I've taken on an entire grade at once, and if I can survive it you can too!  Don't let people see they've hurt you, don't feed them- they want a reaction.  Just remember...happy people don't try to hurt and bring you down, people that are sad, negative, or damaged do.
Does anyone else find her voice so soothing?
how pretty and  cute are u 😗😗😗😗😗😗
Am I the only one that got paining instead of painting at first and was like confused af? Lol I'm so dumb...
l have bad acne and sometimes I get really hurt by other people comments when I'm not wearing makeup. Sometimes even close friends will do hurtful comments without meaning to hurt me. It's hard because we feel insecure. It's like, our face and appearance are our first greeting card. To anyone. If we don't feel comfortable,  people will notice it. So, for me makeup is a bit of a cover up or a mask. My foundation is my second skin, a skin that is perfect. And it helps me a lot with my confidence.
Is Michelle pregnant? Her face is fuller on the sides
I don´t think acne is a reason for someone to humiliate anybode, so i just think who does is idiot, to be honestly. Actually, nothing is a reason for humilate anybode.
I'm in uni already, but I still get acne :( I had it since I was 14! It's crazy!! I hate it when my friend with a clear skin complain when they have a tiny pimple 😠
I was physically and mentally abused by my father when I was young. He used to beat me and lock me in the basement. The idea that people feel 'violated' because they read mean comments get zero sympathy from me. How can you add so much value to someone on the Internets opinions of you, when they don't know anything about you? What's important in our society today is scud... what people say (write) about you should not effect you. At all.

NEVER give anybody power over your mind. You are strong and will over-come, just like I did.
yo acne is super cool. 1. they're pink polka dots on ur face? how cool is that! 2. they're like stars and constellations and ur face looks like a night sky. 3. it makes u look different!! 
don't get me wrong I love makeup and I'm all for anyone wearing as much makeup as they want as long as they know they're beautiful with and without it! love urself, majestic unicorns 🕊👼🏼
U see a lot of Instagram  accounts that live off of memes and they're kinda hypocritical they'll post a pic trying to defend someone to cyber bullying but like 2 post later they post a meme that made fun of a girl with big feet
Thank you very much, Michelle and Ashley! I have been bullied before and there have been people who talked ill about me. The feeling is terrible because it's just unfair when people say things that are not true about me, and when people want to destroy the joy in my life

I do not like this viedio
Mabye having makeup on makes the acne worse. try not using makeup for a couple days and wash your  face in the morning when you get up and at night when you go to sleep
Great video! :)
to help me deal with anything that bothers me about myself, I usually tell myself that I am so much more than that; because I am so much more than my acne, and people should see through it, so whoever doesn't I don't need them in my life.
she should have a meet and greet
Hi MISH, i have a question for you, i have a problem. I 18 years old girl and i never have boyfriend and now i dont want to have, but many people even adult Bullying from me, what can i do ?;/
Michelle are you making excuses, because getting bullied is not ok and yiu shouldn't act like it's ok and that its normal
Hello
I had bad acne for as long as I can remember. the worst bully I had was my own mother. I would try my best to cover up with makeup but she would look down on me for wearing too much of it, saying that makeup only looks bumpy when there's a lot of it but no, it's just my skin. Now, I'm in college and my skin cleared a lot because I found skincare that works. I think I'll be one of those people that will never really outgrow it.
Mish, can  you do a tutorial for your hairstyle???
Did she make this after the episode of "the Internet ruined my life"? This girl was on an episode of it.
Plz do more makeup tutorials!!! You havent done one in two months!! And dont care about what people think. Listen to the people that love you. Ive been watchiny youre makeup tutorials since i was five! You inspired me to do makup. And since i am still a kid so i dont were it so much, it still feels nice when i can. Plz read this comment michelle.
About acne I can't say more than just you do not have to care so much , because others don't. They are focusing on their insecurities and worry about their problems. If they do care, then it's their own issue that they do and you don't have to deal with it, you know. Stay strong and love yourself the way you are! Sorry about my grammar :)
I love Michelle and all her videos. Her YouTube account helps boys and girls. She does fun makeup tutorials, she does these talks that will help all genders,she also does helping videos,and so much more but importantly she is SO PRETTY AND I LOVE HER VIDEOS.
I also only had occasional pimple in high school then very bad adult acne from 25 yrs old to about 33 yrs old. Now at 34 yrs old I am finally using oil based cleansers and moisturisers without fear of a breakout, in fact my skin is dry not oily anymore. Those who are suffering adult acne, don't worry it does go away eventually and don't think harsh cleansers or acne creams did my skin any favours as my skin started getting better after I stopped using those types of skincare.
My boyfriend had a problem with acne, they were HUGE and he couldn't sleep sometimes because he was in pain (they were painful ). So he went to the dermatologist and started using roaccutan. And he was taking those tablets for a long time and now he has none. But roaccutan  is a very strong drug and you must be under medical supervision when taking it and it's expensive and you need prescription to buy it, you have to check up your blood every month, girls can't get pregnant because it can effect baby's health. So I advise people to take this drug ONLY if they have REALLY big problem with acne
it's even funnier when your own family's the one who says the most negative things about your acne. hah... no. it's not funny.
Many makeup products which I have purchased, from my student loan money, were bad qualities, although I bought it from Sephora. So I know...using  bad quality products for makeup which it can never stay on my skin. I was being pushed to the point where I don't have no eyelashes, etc...… I'm sure it's called bully. Isnt it?
Didn't realize acne-shaming was a thing. I thought acne was just something most people have to go through and we can all sympathize with... :/
ANYONE HERE KNOWS WHERE I CAN FIND A TUTORIAL FOR MICHELLE'S HAIR?  pls i think ver hair in this video is so cute
my bff has acne but i have clear skin(only a few pimples n whiteheads sometimes)but she does not care n that's what i luv abt her.she doesn't even wear makeup.i jut wanted 2 say tht ppl r gonna talk abt u even if u r the most beautiful girl in the world but ppl who truly luv u r won't care if have acne,blemishes or whatever.
If you won't say it to their face don't say it behind their back
Great tips, ladies. Any type of shaming is horrible, but acne shaming is something that hits close to home for me. I used to have AWFUL acne growing up. It really took a toll on my self esteem and it took me so long to finally build myself up again. Wish I had videos like this for when I was going through those times. <3
what i  block the comments
and it makes me wanna die more that no one has seen me without makeup since i was 13, ten years now. like..if people saw what my skin really looked like
She's like the youtube Oprah
I battled with adult acne. I did not have acne in high school, but it developed as I got older. I started with curology  this year in January. I have seen such a dramatic change in my skin. Just trying offer some help.
Hola!! soy de México y e visto que tienes vídeos con subtítulos y me preguntaba si pudieras ponerle a todos.sub
pillow talk? how rude. pissing off the neighbors and such. ESPECIALLY in a place to feel the tears and a place to lose your fears. SUCH wreckless behavior. in a place that is so pure, so dirty and raw.....
Well, I got acne at primary school and I still have it at uni. It sucks but nothing works on it and yet life goes on (even with hate and bullying).
Such great topics to cover! No one chooses acne...so why would people feel the need to make fun of someone for that? We just have to continue building each other up, that's why we are all on this planet :) What can you do today to make yourself better, the people around?! Life is too short!! :)
I'm only 12, but I just wanted to say a message:  To be honest I've put up with a lot of trash. I'm not going to list them all, but let's just say I've had a lot of bullies and a few goodbyes. But I've learnt that we were  not given a good or bad life, we were given a life. We have have many bad days, but we don't have a bad life. I do realise that there are people out there suffering, and praying for the best. We all do, sometimes we cant make the moment happen, we have to watch it, and leave it be. That's the hardest part of life, not being able to change moments. Regarding the bad times, I have food, a shelter and a LIFE. We were given our life because we were strong enough to live it. We all need to stay strong, and concur life. ❤️
Life is harsh. Just try to be harsher.
I get acne shamed by my own family people they always say "I'm gonna get a pencil and connect the dots". ,"you're a filthy person that's why you have Nasty pimples" .And I'm not even filthy
I hope you be strong about acne I went though it at a really early age much earlier then some and still battling it all just because of  genetic acne and I got it all over if it wasn't for the people so supported me I probably wouldn't wanted to show my bare face every day I have to take medication and instructions creams for acne but I still love my body
Idfc
Be strong, we now that a lot of poeple use to be very stupid but really when you are someone pretty well known you have two options one be what poeple want you to be two show them the real you and be ready to support their bad thoughts
Hi Michelle.. I am a big fan, I am so glad you made a video about this topic. I was actually suppose to post a video on cyber bullying or bullying in general based on my experience. anyway I know you're busy, but i'd appreciate it if you took the time to take a look at my channel. I'm new and I would appreciate the support. Thanks so much.
Hi Michelle, I love your pillow talk series! And this is the first time I'm commenting and asking for your help. I made a mistake with my best friend (in the moment I made fun of her about something that she is really insecure about on snapchat, and I wasn't thinking about it at the time) and when she told me that it really hurt her feelings,, I apologized and deleted the video cause it made her comfortable. But after I started getting hate videos on snapchat from people who said that we're my friends, calling a bitch, broke and bringing up situations that didn't even relate to what happened between me and my friend. When I asked her why does suddenly everyone know about it now and are calling me names is because she told them. I asked why and why was it any of there business, and she said "take it up with them, I'm not them so idek." And it was so bad that I started bawling my eyes out, and then my parents found out had to calm me down. How can you deal with fake friends?
you're only bullied if you allow it. take my experience for example I felt emotionally hurt through comments about my weight and guess what it made me change. yeah it hurt yeah I cried A LOT but guess what it made me change my ways and take control of my own life.
whoever bullies that someone is ugly in the inside but also in the outisde
I'm ugly too.😕😐😞😭
To be honest if u think your not ugly or whatever they called u then let them talk but just know that those haters are vulnerable and they are not as brave as u because they wouldn't show their face like that even though they know they are going to hate comments
That woman has beautiful features so it doesn't really matter to me. Acne is a skin "disease" actually, so not your fault or because you're nasty. It's a part of her, much rather a superficial part and if you give it meaning, you'll allow it to become a deeper issue. I am glad my skin is this soft, but there are other things that make me flawed, human.
So I get to watching the videos you had on how to apply the shadows in the life pallet and how to use the contour stick and I notice all of the negative comments already being posted about your line. People thought it looked cheap or like a Barbie makeup kit and everyone was just throwing hate at this thing I was so in love with I just couldn't understand why. Then you stopped making as many videos I would look for new vids every day and you were just gone it was like you were too busy for YouTube anymore which is okay, I understand you have a life outside of the YouTube world, but I was worried about you as a person rather than mad at you as a fan. Your makeup line was awesome in my opinion I loved the ideas behind it I loved all of the hard work you had put into it but the rest of the world didn't seem to agree. So today I stumbled upon a review video for one of your life pallets and I realized that's the first actual review video I had ever seen about your products (still more)
I have acne .... And its really hard to deal with it
Boots in bed. Boots. In. Bed.
Having acne is as normal as hair growth. Why do people make it such a big thing? Never have I ever heard or saw anyone wonder why we have hair on our body. Both are normal human body hormonal functions. Some grow more hair and some has acne, nothing more to it!
why do some people juge by looks this market my cry not jk
I realized by watching this video how smarter Michelle is.... Not saying Ashley is not smart or anything like that, but the way each of them spoke had a huge difference. Ashley used so many of "um", "you know", " like" when Michelle worded her words so educated.. sorry if this came out as a hate :c I also use a lot of " like" and trying to fix that... :) you guys both looked so beautiful :)
That was so nice video. I have also acne, but it's mild one. I hope it won't go too bad, that I have to eat medicine. I think people should be proud their own personality, not at all their skin. Personality is important, am I right?
Hey Michelle
And the video was great the girl wished it wasn't a white pallet because it was getting dirty really easily and she talked about how her dark eye shadow shades were getting mixed in with the blush and such which are things I had kind of noticed too but I was willing to look over because I loved the actual makeup so much myself. The girl have a good review so I scroll down to the comments and see all kinds of hate just filling her comment section. More people just like I had saw before saying it looked cheap and it looked low class and it didn't seem that great but none of them had to have tried it because your product is wonderful. I'm sure you've seen the negative comments and I'm sure you've had to go through hell and back with this makeup line but please, from your biggest fan in Kentucky, please don't lose yourself in all of this. Just read the hateful comments and try to find the constructive criticism because it saddens me to see that you've not launched anything new (almost done
Michelle do you like Donald trump of Hilary Clinton
Hi! Can you please do a video on how to make memories and keep them? Or how to show someone they mean a lot to you? Please  help me!
4th and under 301 club :P
Omg she gave the worst responses ever.. This isn't all about her.
having acne.... sigh, just sigh. its worse than you think people! be kind be nice plz
I have rarely dealt with cyberbullying, because when all those haters come around, I just shrug them off. In real life, even though my skin is clear, people still make fun of me, for no reason. And mostly, the ones who do this to me, they mostly have acne. I need advice, should I ignore them, fight them or anything else? Is this jealousy they are experiencing?
Favi in un minuto fa più di 1000 visualizzazioni, Michelle con 8 milioni di subscribers ne fa 900 in 4 lol
there's a girl who is mean to me everyday and texts me hateful things. She sits with me and my friends at lunch, but continues to be rude and mean. I stood up to her, and she left my group. The problem is that everyone in my group are my BEST friends and they really like the girl who hates me, so they begged me to let her back into the group, they even threatened to leave my group, so I had to let her in. I can't just leave the group, because no one else likes me
My dad says to not get acne or pimples just eat fruits and vegetables while you're still 12+ and eat less oily and sweet foods.
Unrelated to the vid topic, but hoping someone will know - how safe is the little canopy with string-lights folded into it that Mish has in the back corner? I love the whimsical look and ambient light, but I'm not sure if this is something she keeps more for videos or if it's actually alright to have as part of a room design. Does it just take certain types of lights, like LEDs? Thanks!
keep this comment to an even number of likes
i'm in uni and my acne is worse than in high school. it gets to me every day. i even work at a pool, so i can't wear makeup, and i wonder what others are thinking of me. but, as ashley said, there are so many worse things that could happen. i could be blind, or deaf, or have a limb missing, so why am i worrying about something i can hide?
I suffered bullying because of my skin color, in life, and because of my religion, on internet. I just ignored bullies, I think they are dumb and short minded people, because, come on, we live in such an enormous world, we are millions and millions, we are all different, we will always be, humans are complex, unique, so whoever fights that... wel... I´m sorry for them, really :-/
I remember seeing that video of her getting her makeup done, I remember those horrible comments. I feel bad for her but I also felt that for every person with acne because when you shame a person with acne it affects more people than you think. I have acne and it's pretty severe and people saying such horrible comments about people having acne just makes me so insecure.
When in the past someone said PILLOW TALK i tought about Michelle, but now i think about Zayn... sorry
Michelle is Lipsyncing
Jordeecakes jay makes an interesting point (posted 1 month ago) when she says:  "people will ALWAYS talk. Just choose...."My 'corollary'  to her point would be that.....We non-bullies should realize that if we are [or aspire to be] balanced human beings, we have to accept that...not EVERYone has to love US.....And, of course, that means the reverse is also true....WE don't have to love EVERYone.  Love - and hate - are just emotions...but when people take a negative emotion like hate and [thru their ACTION or behavior] turn it into an assault, whether verbal or physical [or with words in print, as in Ashley's case], the assault is unacceptable and inexcusable.  [You can't kill by just thinking alone, but ACTIONS can most definitely kill]....
At the end of the day you are still "Hotter" than other girls who face this so get over it.
White people wearing shoes to bed and wondering why they can't face problems in life. It's in the details girl.
People are rude af. Cyber bullies are looking for the weaker ones. That's why I get evidence that they're bullying me and report them.
Bullies are poor people... They need attention and so they try to get it just a like that. But it's negative attention, though..
happy birthday😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😙😙😙😚😚😚😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😆😆😆😆😇😇😇😇👸👸😺😺😺😻😻😺😸😽😽😽💛💗💙❤💜💚💓💘💖💋💓💌💎
Bullies are just sad small minded people. I've had so many horrible comments left on my videos. People telling me to kill myself or to get back in the kitchen. I just laugh it off. It is what it is. You just have to know who you are and love yourself.
im only nine i started my youtube channel for ine week i got so much bad commets im crying wright now
YOUR NEVER GOING TO "CURE THE HATE" all you can do is find them and take their life. Just like the black people are doing.
Cool video ♥
She
For me i don care if people is ugly or nice, rich or poor all i care is the people is nice in the inside, kind, generous
People who bully others don't actually feel good about themselves, because when you do feel content with your life and yourself as a person, you don't feel the need to make others feel bad about themselves...I can't stand bullying, it's a horrible thing to do, and it can push people to do terrible things to themselves
There was always this mean girl in my class that just hated me for no reason and everyday she would just gossip about me. Then I heard that I had cancer (stage 3 Lymphoma) when I was 15 and at that time I never went to school because I was in the hospital all the time getting surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. My best friend wanted to send a card to me from all of my classmates and they all had to pay a couple of cents for the card so that they all payed an even amount of money. So the mean girl had to pay too but she said "No, she's not worthy of my money" and she didn't write anything in the card. I was shocked when I heard it from my best friend cause I just heard I had cancer and I just thought everyone would stop the bullying and hating but she didn't.. At that time I didn't even know if I was gonna survive and still she hated me for absolutely no reason. I never did anything to her, I'm too shy for that and I always tried to become friends with her..
If anyone says shit to you, you'd think it's unfair and awful,but people can say what they want to be honest as it's THEIR statement. It's really just up to you and your thoughts how to handle it. I hope it doesnt get to you.
Hmm acne isn't so bad. I have acne as an adult but I also know that they aren't permanent and it doesn't disfigure my face. No biggie, not even worth bullying about. Although I think it's too ambitious to try and stop cyber bullying. The Internet is the one place people can anonymously say all the harshest things one can imagine, so they run with it. So The way I see it, if you want to put yourself out there online, make sure you have a thick skin.
Hermosas!!! ✨✨ tengo SORTEO en mi canal! Vayan y participen! Súper fácil!✨✨✨
It's kinda lucky for me because people where i live don't really care about whether i have acne or not. They just say that acne is normal no need to be shame, when i had acne my parents, my friend, teacher told me not to touch it, took care of it more and i didn't have to wear make up, that's not good for ur skin . After all  acne is completely normal , it's not a big deal everyone have it once in their life. Stop judging people who have acne
People call me ugly because of my acne
It makes me sad how people started doing the don't judge me challenge that's still shaming just Cus someone has scars, spots or even a mono-brow doesn't mean they're ugly. Everyone is beautiful and you shouldn't doubt yourself because of someone's opinion your insecurities make you, so try and love that.
Go vegan. Your acne will fade away!!! And plus we as women get acne when we are nearing PMS!
This is totally insane!!! I don't wear makeup but I have really bad skin, lots of rashes, bad dark circles, and a little acne and so many people make fun me. I don't understand this how come when we do and don't wear makeup people make fun of you!!! It isn't even our fault for having these kinds of problems why do we need to make fun of people for something none of us can help??? Please stop making fun of people. It doesn't stop is from having acne or make us disappear from you "precious" eyes. This is something nobody should have to go through.
Kinda perfect timing. Yesterday someone said really nasty things to me "you are so fake. Glad i'm not as ugly as you" etc. For no reason. Why do you want to say something like that out loud to someone? Yes everyone has their opinion but why do you have to say it out loud. It's so easy to hide behind the screen and hit your keyboard and ruin someone's self confidence.
It is not your fault for being upset about someone's comment. Just because they can say it, doesn't mean they should say it. People are so selfish and thoughtless about what they say. The simple solution is just to be a decent human being and understand that everyone's life are just as complex and eventful as yours. They have feelings and problems in their lives. This goes beyond appearance.
Can't you just disable the yt comments?
that's what block is for
Doesnt Kylie Jenner have HORRIBLE acne? How come she deosnt get so much hate? Like people! That's a real person youre talking to a REAL LIVE PERSON.
how is Michelle not more popular/talked about? I get she doesn't do "fun" videos like Tyler or Bethany, but Michelle's videos are so professional & soothing (her voice!)

Was a little surprised that almond oil wasn't mentioned. Lately I've been rubbing it into my skin immediately after a shower, and my skin has become super soft. 
Great video btw, argan oil is a godsend for my hair <3
Hey Michelle, I miss you❤️ :(
She has such an angelic voice😍..Could you do a song cover someday?That would be so great. 😊
All of the ladies in this video were just beautiful!
Can you please do a video on different skin types ❤️ And what sort of foundation to go for xx
Video is super soothing. It calmed my mind.
By far the most informative video by michelle phan :)
Can you make a video about ingredients that you should avoid in products? Thank you!
I don't know why but I was crying at the end of the video because I love how you include all kinds of people on your videos it is so beautiful
Who else is addicted to watching Michelle Phan😍😍?!
I love Michelle's asthetics omg it's so unique and refreshing! Love you girl
Love you. I have been watching your YouTube videos for years!😄😄😄😘
Michelle, thank you. For being you. For celebrating life and diversity and for encouraging and empowering women and even men to be the people they hope to become. I had tears in my eyes seeing these gorgeous women celebrate with you.
HER EDITING IS GOALS
I love using these oils on my hair and skin! Bring GenBeauty to Orlando!!
Miss you Michelle!!  Hope you are happy :)
Thanks for being so inspiring! I'd love if you could I another diy room decor for unicorns video, I've watched it about 15 times! It's one of my favorite videos of yours.
Ur so positive I feel so relief if i see ur videos when I have stress! Love ya
Can you do a vid with essential oils??
Id love to see a hair tutorial for the style you wore in this video Michelle. So cute and reminds me a bit of Luna's hair when she turns into a human in the movie #SailorMoonThrowback
hi..lam maryam from Iraq l love you so much l hope you translation your video 😘😙
I love the 3rd girl's hair, such beautiful curls 😍
all of these women are so beautiful and unique and I love Michelle for choosing different races and sizes of women
does anyone know a video tutorial on how to do hair like michelle in this vid??
How do you do your hair like this????? X
Michelle is such a goddess 😍
I like how your videos are a bit ASMR but Not so much as to put people off who don't like it ✌🏼
Really love all of the diversity in this video! Awesomeness :)
I love how you not only do makeup/beauty related things,you also make videos on many different types of topics like the how to de-stress I fought depression when I was EIGHT years old (maybe nine forgot exact age) you really seem to somewhat care for your viewers unlike other YouTubers who just say they love their fans for views I can't see that in you at all.



                     -Aileen
another great oil for hair: rosemary oil! it helps stimulate hair growth while strengthening it, and also reduces hair loss!
insteae of the lash or brow serum you can use castor oil!
3 years later and I still watch this video for oil recommendations
Can you please do a video on mastering the art of hair products. Like, shampoo, conditioner, pomade, waxes, masques ect.  And what about one for (hair) wash day, for beginners.
WE MISS YOU ❤️😭😭
Sad.. I developed acne like i never had before after using rosehip oil for one week, I wonder, did i over use it 😔😔
The silver haired lady is beautiful!!!!!  love those dyed tips!
Literally the best video I've seen. So informative and creative. Thank you Michelle 🙌🏼😍

i love the fact that you include every type of person and skin type for your vids. Makes it really professional 
Love you Mish :*

Your videos are always so informative! You're so beautiful inside and out ❤️
Mastering the art of hairstyles! Your hair is always gorgeous 😭💜🦄
I just tried argan life Argan Oil for the first time last month and my face and hands feels so much smoother already. I have horribly dry skin in the winter! I'll definitely be using this every day.
Are Michelle and Dom still together?
It's 2018 and I still miss her
thanks so much for this video! very helpful. Amazing editing too.
Oils are amazing.

HOWEVER, I tried oil pulling for a week and I was extremely sick after.
I am an advocate for using oils in place of other products that contain chemicals and who knows what, so I greatly appreciate this video! Educating others in how to use natural solutions to fix common problems is so important!
castor oil also helps eyelash growth
I love this! So helpful and the filming and editing is amazing! Can you do a 'mastering the art of serums'? 💖 love you Michelle! 💖

Hello Michelle, 

Good day from the Philippines! :)

This is so peaceful! You have an amazing voice

this is amazing thank you
What about mastering the art of proper  skin care... I've been having trouble with that.
This video really helped me to take care of my hair and face ^^
Your voice is so calming😍
Argan-oil black caster oil-avocado oil-
Great video, aside from the oil pulling: it is a good technique when you have no brush, toothpaste etc, because it is an apolar liquid and therefore it's more likely the things you have between your teeth will get swooshed out and get in solution. Our spit does the same thing by the way but more effectively and it has antibacterial properties. 
The risk of aspirating the oil is pretty high and oil in the lung can be a growing ground for bacteria, which can be dangerous and lead to pneumonia (lung infection).
So rather than doing oil bulling: brush your teeth with tootpaste, (fluoride helps your teeth remineralise) and use dental floss for the spaces between teeth and drink enough water. 
By the way, I love your graphics, and I can't even stop looking at your hair.<3
My favorite oil for hair is coconut oil and amla hair oil!! My hair is so silky smooth and soft
Your videos are pure art...the way they're filmed and edited and the music used omg I love it!
Just subbed. Its so worth watching and its so relaxing. I'm new to this channel but, Love your look.

What oil is she talking about when she says "apply it in your skin or foundation for extra luminosity"? It's between 2:20-2:40 where she says it. Is she talking about cleansing oil or rosehip oil?

Wow New sub. i LOVE YOUR VOICE
I really consider of using serum together with oil for skin care but I have no idea how to use them enough for the skin, I feel so hopeless when applying them together, or combining with nourishing cream in the evening, and daily use after applying suncream. I hope that you can do some tutorials about combining and using it for moisturizing or hydrating, or different  purpose.

So in love with those knowledge like this.
tutorial on your hair style please!

WOW, what an amazing and informative video. what an amazing video and how great how you chose people watching your videos to participate! i loved that. Could you do a video on anti aging next please? like natural remedies for anti aging seeing as creams and stuff is so expensive. the only thing about this video is that some body oils you mentioned even though thicker can still be used on the face and shouldnt be limited to body because they are thicker. great video anyways and the best ive seen on youtube because its so cheap to do all this! my mom has thin hair and ive recommended black castor oil to her.  thank you for the effort you put in to making this

I swear by my witch hazel + apple cider vinegar toner and rosehip seed oil to reduce the appearance of tiny scar on my face! I have slight discoloration but no acne scar >:D Well my acne isnt even that bad but I do get hormonal breakouts...
I want more videos like this, editing on point
Mish thank you so much for this videoo :)
And plus everybody is so beautiful in this video, especially their hair!
This was such a good and informative video. Thanks Michelle.
You definitely need to make a video on how to do some of your hairstyles ! I love them but I can never figure out how or where to find a similar tutorial
Can you please do a diy bad girl /Instagram baddie clothing 💕
Loved this video ! Just recently I started adding oils in my beauty routine. It is just a very healthy organic way to take care of yourself without the need of harsh chemicals in other beauty products !
``~Impressive production value!  Thanks for referring to we,  your viewers, as 'majestic ones.~``
All these girls have such excellent hair
It's kind of sad that I can't use oil on my face. I've tried olive oil and green tea mask and I've used bio-oil to fade my acne scars but they will just give me more break outs and acne.. 😢

wow they are all so beautiful!
argan oil has a kina red tone into it i know because im moroccan and the argan oil you showed looked like olive oil idk
I love how diverse her videos are!
It's just an idea but maybe a video about hypoallergenic skin or VERY sensitive skin ? It's very different from dry skin and people do not talk a lot about it..
I don't know if there are food that could help or creams or again oil to help the skin be revitalized~ If you actually make a video about that I know it will be a good professional and complete video (I mean like you always do honestly :3) that could helpful for many people ! (I'm very young but my skin is so sensible sometimes i can not put ANYTHING on it if it's not very natural even creams that are expensive and special for hypoallergenic skin burns) So yeah it's just an idea / request >< I'm sure I'm not the only one with very sensible skin :)
* Omg Elleeeen !! *
thank you Michelle Phan

perhaps you could make a video explaining the importance of the vitamins mentioned and what benefits they provide for your face and body ☺
2:43 more richer skin XD Michelle grammar
This helped a lot. Thanks :)
Their hair is literally goals. Love Michelle's hair!!
Tea tree oil anyone?
I put a few drops in my shampoo bottle because I wash my hair weekly. Bacteria? Product Build up?  The smell of weed? (I live in London) Mustiness from sweating out my blowout at badminton? Gone. 404 error not found.
Apparently it stops dandruff and headlice too but I've never had either to testify on that.
I subscribed! Michelle's voice is so relaxing and soothing... I don't know why but it is... maybe do "Mastering the art of a soothing voice?" I don't even know... but there is so many things to master in an art that you can't really like truly _master_ it. Thanks Michelle for this video. It helped a lot. 
 
All the love and hopes,
      Myra
i loved this video...thank you!
For the past few years, I have been using oils for all moisturising and fighting wrinkles - really quite effective. Also fish oils as supplements to keep joints in good shape and to improve heart health. For scars there's one  that's reasonably priced called PureOil. In 2009 I tried oil pulling and it really does make the teeth shine, but it's a tad messy .Dry oils not so common in Singapore yet, if you got a couple I could try out, do drop me a line and might grab them off Amazon. Thanks
you should make a vloging channel
do one of these on exfoliants!

UUUUUH WHY R U SO CUTE
Mastering the art of tea!
some of these oils can be bad for people's skin so it's important to spot test it before putting it on their face or body. 

also, not everyone's skin is the same so assuming that these oils do work for reducing inflammation etc is foolhardy. It all depends  

I wish you would put this warning in videos before teaching it to young impressionable girls who'll put this on their skin and get rashes (I used to be one of those young girls who followed your skin tips and ended up with a rash on the apples of my cheeks because turns out my skin can't handle having lemon on it)
can you do a tutorial on oils thats good for your hair
amazing!! thank you
How about mastering the Art of making an aesthetically pleasing video like this one

Hope you have a great day Michelle. xx

I love Michelle's hairstyle! Does anyone know the name? I'm trying to search for a tutorial because I can't see her hair clearly.
Does anybody here use grapeseed oil for oily/acne prone skin? Pls. let me know if it helps your skin. Thanks! :)
Watching all your videos are incredible !! but I want to know if you can send me links or giving me suggestions about face health care .. My face have been very dry and have acnes so I'm trying to buy some products for my face but idk any and watching ur videos gives me good ideas so if you're fine with telling me or replying back to me to go buy some face products for face skin care let me know ASAP please ..
Thanks
Love your videos, being a cosmetologist, MUA, and Esthetician I love Essential Oils from my hair, face, make up and body! love love that you made an educational video on multiple oils and uses! My fave are Coconut, Sweet Almond Oil, Roseship Oil, and Jojoba amongst others!
would olive oil work for oil pulling??
What about oily skin? My face is always oily especially at the end of the day
I was wondering if you can do some video solely about body and face acne
I was looking for a video like this. I'm definitely going to try all those tips out. Thanks :)
Please do a mastering the art of skincare

interesting,i wana try almond oil for my face idk
you should do more makeup tutorials
your hair style in the end !!! diy ???????
WHAT'S TLC?????
Neen oil "! yes that oil 😃
of you hate the grease or oiliness of oil then just use glycerin with water on skin and hair
it made my hair so soft people would ask me if its still wet because it was so moisturized and silky and healthy
it also really moisturizes my skin without making me sweat and oily looking  and has toned my skin
its good to use in all weathers including cold weather because of the water you mix with it. mix with water when applying and not in the bottle pour water till its not sticky or viscous
youre welcome! 
plus glycerin is way cheaper than oil. its more moisturizing, and not greasy or sticky when mixed with water
i could do yoga to this
Everybody's hair in this video 😍😍😍
How about emu oil?
Hi, which part of the video did she mention bio-oil? Thank you!
I LOVE YOU
your look in this video is awesome... y don't u make a video of it?
Would oils make oily skin even more oily? And if not what type of oil would be the best oil for oily acne prone skin?
I have been using the Argan life pure argan oil for over a week now and am very happy with the pro duct. It doesn't leave my skin as oily as I thought like other creams do. I also use this on my neck, chest, nails and a couple of drops in my hair. Great pro duct!
I am already using oils in my day routine because I think that oils are one of the most naturals way to take care of yourself. This video is so useful in describing all this oils!!! Well done! Get inspired!!
I love Michelle because she stands for so much good in the world, she supports it, helps it, embraces it, and introduces us to it so it will become a norm. She is such an inspiration to me and I hope to one day meet her or become just like her. She also helped me with my Anxiety issues. I just think of what she would do, and calm down.
I love oils especially on my face.
She NEVER posts anymore it's soooo sad cause I love her videos 😭😭
So, I was just wondering if you can give specific steps. For example, how much of each oil do we need for the hair mask? Depending on the length? things like that.
How about almond oil for the face?
This was incredibly calming to watch.
i literally want to be u wtf
I love how she includes tips for all hair and skin types 💜💜 michelle honey you're doing amazing sweetie
Hello!!! I have 2 questions!! I have a oily scalp and hair, but I have dandruff after day or 2 of washing and blow drying 😢. What oils can I use? And which oil can I use to get whiter teeth?🤗 thank you and love you!!! 
kells🦄
ive been recently using an apple cider vinegar toner and it's literally amazing, i mix about half a cup of distilled water with 1-2 tablespoons of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar and i recently started adding a few drops of tea tree oil and a tablespoon of rose water in and it's literally a blessing

What oil is best for removing make-up? olive, coconut, or grape seed? Will they clog pores?
I fell asleep because her voice is so soothing!
where can you get those oils?
Thank you very much MP!
I love her voice!!!
Tea tree oil also works for acne! Just make sure you dilute it first before applying it to your face. 1/2 cup of water : 2-4 drops of tea tree oil. Wash your face and then apply the solution/mixture to your face with a cotton pad. Let it dry for 20-25 minutes and then apply moisturizer, you don't have to wash it off your face. Do this maybe twice daily for effective results. You can also add 1 drop to your moisturizer. Hope this helps! :))
boi oil is great for scars and stretch marks!!
pretty
Does anyone know if rosehip oil is safe for sensitive skin on the face?
where can i buy all these oils please! especiailly avocado oils!

Great video Michelle
I miss her videos when it was just makeup her channel is lowkey boring now.
the thing is, are these pure oil? like for example the argan oil, you can actually use argan oil for your hair and skin. everything here is diluted.
Thank you for this tutorial.  Michelle, do you still have the "oil slick" hair color?  Can we have an update on the upkeep of such a bold choice?  Thank you
Oil on hair is heavy, weighs hair down, doesnt wash off, so you need to clarify because of build up. Oil also drastically affects dyed hair, makes reds, blndes look drab and brassy! Because she knows it all, lol!
Which oil to be used for oily skin?
You can use olive oil on the face too, it works very good and doesn't clog pores.
This video was so relaxing to watch. 💚
What rose oil do ?
... omg there is so much to learn... i just use coconut oil in everything... e ve ry taaaang. but it works quite well imo
U should make a story about yourselves who agrees
R u still with ur boyfriend?
Lavender oil - perfect for everything.. hair, face and body. Fill a small spray bottle with water and ten drops of lavender oil and you're good to go.
What  a beautiful video❤❤❤
GURRRLL i use that same conditioner in the beginning! ! as s black girl my hair needs ALOT OF MOISTURE!!! our itll start breaking off but that conditioner literally keeps my hair moisturize & healthy for a couple weeks!!!
I miss you😭

What is suitable for keloide scar on body?
Thanks😙

Michelle's hairstyle looks so cute. Does anybody know which video shows how to do it? 
Tks
All the women were so beautiful!!!!
Please make video with your boyfriend. I miss both of you on the same frame huhu
I use coconut oil with honey, yogurt or egg for deep conditioning. Leave an hour and you will have soft and manageable hair. The mixture works as a deep moisturizing mask. If you have dandruff also add few drops of lemon into  your oil and say bye to dandruff, but be consistent.
You're videos are always so professional and informative, and the editing is always on point! I refer to this video all the time to create my own home made remedies. As a future "mastering the arts of" suggestion, maybe a mastering the art of plants and herbs in skin and hair care? Like how certain roots (ginger, turmeric as example) have certain benefits, as well as tea and i'm sure many other plants do as well?
I would love a more detailed episode on hair, and I know you already made a wonderful video on your skin care routine but I would love something more on it :3 Also, for chapped lips or something ^^ And a more detailed video on preventing acne? Face masks are also cool XD Or applying certain make up things..? Thanks Mish!
Her voice is so peaceful
This is nice. The oil can be good for the skin most of the time. Infections and pimples are a bit harder with oil, because the staphylococcus can hide under the oil and eat it too. Be careful with infected skin, if you use oil.
can you do more makeup tourtoials?
I know your channel is about a beauty and you teach how to look after an appearance ,but everyone knows that  beauty comes also from inside ,please can you make a video about cocktails or drinks which helps to clean and refresh the organism ,cuz the way you do it is so interesting and easy ,I would really appreciate and  be thankful to you for this ,your follower from  Russia ,love ya❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved seeing all the different women
did anyone see the horse conditioner
How do you do your hair like that?
what is a good oil for skin that has psoriasis? if anyone knows please let me know :)
WHAT SONG DOES SHE USE FOR HER OUTRO? SERIOUSLY
can you palease tell me what camera you use
Which oil to mix with foundation?
For the hair mask instead of using olive oil you should use almond oil but the castor oil and coconut oil is correct
Since you are an artist as well, featuring some of your favourite artist or new and up-coming artist would be great! Or what you did with with video, but with different artists. I know your channel is more beauty related, but this would be a great way to showcase that side of you!
I love the fact that these are real women not all flawless models that all look the same. Diversity is beautiful. ❤️
Wow!!!!!!
I love how positive the comments are. Good for you Michelle for creating and positive and safe space that everyone can participate in.
My face and hair is oily enough ;-;
I never thought I could use oil on my face but DHC changed that.  My skin is so smooth, clear and radiant.  Lovin' this!
I like < 3 ●
WHERE CAN I BUY EM COSMETICS???
i miss you
great viedeo
Am I the only one that thinks that she has lost a lot of subscribers???
Miss you girl ! :(
What about shea oil and almond oil? :)
Wait, you swish oil around in your mouth for 20 minutes?!
Does anyone else think that her voice is relaxing
does anyone know where to find black castor oil? only the jamaican kind keeps coming up. is that the same thing. if someone could reply back thanks..michelle?
can u explain the basics of linoleic acid and oleic acid when it comes to face oils? I mean, just because jojoba mimics your sebum doesn't mean any skin type can benefit from it. I have heard that depending on which acid is stronger in the oil, it will work for a particular skin type/concern, more info would be awesome :)
Omg! Is this the song from the Today&Tonight channel on the old Wii? I watched this video a few times and It sounds just like it hahaha!
I love using oil!! A lot of people who have acne are afraid of using oil on their face lest it would make their skin oily and break out more, but that's not true! Applying the right kind of oil actually reduces the oil production :)
does anyone know for how long should we keep the pre wash hair mask on?
Is coconut oil good or bad for your face? Some people say its bad and others say its good. Can it cause breakouts?
glad that she is broadening her career but I miss her daily videos . . .
I have terrible acne marks/scars does the Rose hip oil really help?
Hi did you know that my parents was born in Vietnam as I understand everything okay
I definitely like this Argan Rain %100 Pure Argan Oil product. I have seen its results on especially dry areas of my body (shins). I actually had someone tell me what nice 'makeup' I use!!! Considering I don't wear any foundation just moisturizer, it gave me a good laugh.
I'm not swishing oil in my mouth for 20 min lol. other then that it was a useful video
This video is so beautifully done
We want more of your video and voice.Michell please come back

Bio oil is full of mineral oil! how can that be good for the skin?

Question for anyone to answer!  At 2:19, what product does she mean by "you can use 'it'" to mix with your foundation?

Can you put something for more prone acne skin
Yeehhhh
jojoba oil genuinely saved my skin... i dont use my dermatologist acne creams anymore because jojoba oil and tea tree oil (spot treat) pretty much got rid of my acne, it's crazy. i truly believe that oils are the best thing you can possibly put on your skin.
instead of watching asmr for relaxation, i watch michelle phan's videos. her voice is just sooooo soothing. love it! i wish she returns to youtube.
your voice is so cute
Michelle.... Where is Dom?  :OOOO
Idk why but watching this video is so relaxing?? Like the music is so chill and the editing is so cute and pretty. Goals 
do a new vid
💜💜💜💜
What ever happened to the makeup videos?
I love the music she puts in her videos
does anyone know the name of the song in her outtro??
The girl with the curly hair is so beautiful oh my gods

miss you!

So glad I found this video! Beautifully done. I also share your love for oils. I'd really like to know your opinion on Cacay oil, Borage oil and Camellia oil? I personally love the last two and am planning on trying the Cacay oil next. Thanks so much!
I miss michelle phan 2014 and 2015 hmmm
Wow, great video! I'm not that good at english but I got most of it :D just one question, what is TLC? If that whats she said, I'm not sure :S I think she says "If you hair need a little TLC" on minute 0:32
I love oils for body, face and hair. Caudalie has amazing products with Oil of grape seeds: exfoliant Cabernet, Oil Divine and Premier Cru Elixir. Josie Maran and Kérastase has wonderful products with oil of argan and sesame.
Just buy all the oils.
Where are u Michelle

anyone have any good suggestions for hair loss/ thinning hair. I am anemic and losing alot of hair everyday. how do I stop hair loss and thicken my hair? ?
I used coconut oil on my lashes for like 2 weeks and it grew noticeably longer.
can somebody tell me where to find these?
oils for oily skin please!
thank you Michelle for helping all the girls and guys in they world who needed advice for makeup,life,oil,pets and everything else that you do.I can imagine being a business women and still giving so much time filming a video and coming up with ideas,must be tiring but I think you love us a lot.Thank you for being a superwomen in my life.Love you and can't wait to watch more.:) good luck ;)
I have very pigmented thick lips for a Asian girl and I was wondering how to make the more pale?
My son(5yrs) gets itchy after bath which oil to use? How to find put what type of skin he has?
I don't like oil...I'm oily enough already
You can also make your own body wash using oils. I don't use measurements, but it is a pretty flexible recipe, use any oils you want. The ingredients are:

• Dr. Bronners Castile Soap (use about a cup)
•organic raw honey (about a tablespoon)
•coconut oil (about 3 tablespoons)
•avocado oil (about 2 tablespoons)
•sweet almond oil (about 1 tablespoon, great with the almond scented castile soap)
•vitamin e oil (about 2 teaspoons)

You will need to shake it well before every use because the ingredients will start separating, it's normal! It's great especially in the winter. You will still get a lather from the castile soap, but all of the oils will be coating and moisturizing your skin while the soap cleans. Sometimes I've even skipped out on moisturizing after because this stuff works so well. My skin has never felt better!
omg I need help with my hair, to thicken and from losing hair, I am losing so much hair, everytime I run my fingers through my hair so much hair comes out... PLEASE HELP!! been using rosemary oil, peppermint oil, grapeseed oil and castor oil but not helping, also need help for discolouration on the face, using coconut oil breaks me out..  😢😘
Is it safe to do oil pulling with fillings?
is it just me or did michelle get boujee all of a sudden
hi Michelle......hope u will reply....fingers crossed 😊....want to buy a product to give my skin little bit of tlc 😊....but i am confused between vitamin c serum or rosehip oil.....need your suggestion to pick up right product
Does anyone know what kind of hairstyle she's wearing here? It looks cute as hell and I want to try it for a concert I have coming up next week.
all the women were sooooooooooooo damn gorgeous!
most satisfying video ever to watch
This video was so beautiful to watch!
Do a spring makeup tutorial please
I don't like the sent of most of the hair oils you mentioned. can I add green apple perfume oil to make it smell good?
I sleep with her voice it's so soothing
no moringa oil? :(
Please do not put olive oil on your skin or hair. Eating olive oil is fine but if you want to aply it topically keep in mind that in the lab when want to grow bacteria we feed it olive oil because they natural thrive in it.
She has the voice of an angel. Haha
is there a way to get a free copy of your book? or a signed one? thanks!
How did you do your hair in this video????
I'd love to see a broken down version of this video. In depth on oils for course and curly hair, in depth on oils for stretch marks, etc.
Ahhhh I love your videos!!! Every single one is like a mini movie :)
editing is so freaking peaceful, creative, chill i feel like im meditating watching this A MOOD
Your videos ❤ please please do more frequent videos love ❤
I missed you Michelle ❤️❤️
Imho.. Liquid foundation is destroying everyones skin.
Skin needs to breathe!!!!
Disclaimer: There will be no getting thru to me, 😄 lol
Love u Michelle
What product does the person use at 3:33??
So grapeseed oil isn't comedogenic???
I love Michael so much ,little did she know I came her to learn from her beauty tips and get rid off my stress❤😘
If you're looking for good essential oils you can find them here @ yorhealth.com/wendylow7 100% pure certified organics!!
my hair is dry and thin, Can I use organ oil or abssyssain oil and able to my conditioner ?
how many drops should I add into my conditioner
Can you tell me how to enhance skin colour by using oil?
Can I get The DIY of teeth whitening :D
Having sensitive skin I try so much nothing work I believe in natural remedies so olive oil and eat lots of olive love ❤️ olives 😋
i know this is unusual but it helps if you have acne or spots, like me. I use mustard oil to cleanse my face before I go to sleep at night and I do this everyday, the difference is amazing! Even if you have oily skin it works, you can buy this in a local supermarket.
0:40 I thought I was the only person who still uses horse shampoo!
May I glow from the ancient wisdom of oils
this is such a beautiful video. I love the aesthetic
I miss you
i wish instead of hauls beauty gurus did more videos like this. Where they do research and pass it on
This video was super cool and calming. I like how Michelle sounds so mellow like she used to in her old videos.
Very helpful and beautiful video
Hey! Such an awesome video and tips! ;) the only thing I don't agree is coconut oil on curly hair. I've tried SO MANY times and it makes them extremely dry because it gets too deep into hair structure. Olive oil is awesome and I've tried lately Hazelnut oil - and I highly recommend that duo :)
Swirling the oil in your mouth for 20 minutes?? Or did I hear that wrongly?
Red skin around eyes, on hands, around nose, mouth, like she was crying, how to treat it ,what is it from?
The girl at 2:43 has awesome hair :O
The woman with the grey and blue hair aged so gracefully omg goals
I didn't mean to be rude or anything, but i'm wondering if mish is still with Dom or not :|
what about oil that ruins our body and environment?
what is her snapchat?
Shes working from the outside in she didnt say anything about healthy foods to eat or drinking water. Very interesting tho😘
WAS THAT KARINA KHO
I miss she makeup tutorial
Why does everyone in this video have such nice hair :( I want nice hair.
I love Michelle,  her voice is so soothing !!
where do you recommend buying these oils, i want them to be pure but safe to apply directly to the skin!! :D
Lol
The people casted here are all beautiful and attractive and unique in their own way.. it's always so interesting to see people's differences are embraced so gracefully and even enhanced. I love it!
Por favor, Michelle, pon subtítulos en español. Gracias.
There is an awesome product called LEG GLO that I use it a body sheen oil that give your legs a glow. They have a website. :)
Did you mean 20 seconds? Or is it really supposed to be 20 minutes of swishing oil around in your mouth?
can u please say the ratio of shower her to 10 drops of oil ? or how much ml of shower gel to 1o drops of oil ?
that girl in the first part is a taurus yaass
good tips!
is there actually scientific proof that oil pulling helps with clearing skin and whitening teeth? I just can't wrap my head around how it somehow "cleanses everything" when you're just swishing oil in your mouth...
You are so cool Michelle
Hola, guapa. Porqué no traduces al español. Sería fantástico para la comunidad hispana poderte seguir. Gracias Michel.
Nice video😎
I have curly hair and coconut oil is awful for it.  It makes it actually dry and brittle
thinking of unsubscribing bc there's no more makeup vids.... lol
How do you make your AWSOME VIDS !
What an amazing video!  It gives spa vibes that are so relaxing and soothing :):):)
www.goldenmoroccanskincare.com
Her voice is so calm
loved this wow
Your voice is so SOOTHING
I miss you, we miss you.
I use coconut oil mix with vit.e and a vaseline for wrinkles and eyebrow grower. It helps a lot!
Anyone know what you'd call the hair style this lady has at 3:15?
I think last I've seen a video of Michelle was like 3yrs ago or 2 I'm not sure, looks like she did some works on her face.I know it's been years but not that long since I've seen her last. but she looks a lot aged now. I hope I'm wrong, I like her face before, natural beauty. if someone can answer my wonder n curiosity I'd appreciate that.  nice video tho,very informative :)
I watched this video and a professional dermatologist said coconut oil is actually bad for your skin and wouldn't recommend it to remove makeup.
hi, every body argan œil is very the best œil for body skin  becouse he clean it  .can you try with it.
Oils on the face are a big No No according to dermatologists.  It’s funny how we used to believe everything she used to said.
If I were to mix a couple drops of oil in my foundation and apply the mixture to my face, would the foundation be absorbed and eventually clog my pores? Please explain.
aesthetic
LOVE LOVE LOVE it ! <3
Can you use castor oil directly for face and body?? (please respond)
Girl at 3:13 looks like Sangwoo! But she's really beautiful <3
Miss you!
Really like ur diy home remedies but does this really apply for oily skin in singapore where we have no seasons? The last time i tried on a oil base makeup remover i had a bad breakout
Amazing video! Am obsessed with oils!! even though my body does not accept it that much I mix with my body lotion,for hair I use as prepoo treatment and mix in my hair butter,for my face I mix with face cream so I basically don't use them directly... Am a new youtuber so meeting you now is so great for me and my new channel
i felt so sick when i found out that michelle haters posted nonsense n stupid rumors bout her....ugh...Michelle stay strong!!!haters will hate anyway 😌
Why doesn't she post anymore?
How to like school? I absolutely despise it and I'm not allowed to be homeschooled. It's making me really depressed. Thanks! 
Forgot tamanu oil
https://youtu.be/s0VIG-SOsSc
Where are you?
Oil pulling does not have any scientific evidence to help with ailments. Just check out snopes or ask a dentist. My Creationist roommate swears by it - that's reason enough to know it's bunk.
I miss her. Does anyone know where she go??
What song does she use at the end of her videos?
her baby hair is faaaaab
UGH....I MISS HER SO MUCH!
♡♡Oh Please Michelle ! Do More teeth techniques like oil pulling .....ext  !! We Really neeed More of your beauty Hacks :D Thank youuuuuuu sooo MUCH ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡

Miss u mish
what about tea tree oil?
❤️
Thank you
hi just want to ask how much or measurement of mixing castor oil,olive olive oil,coconut oil and conditioner?
so satisfying
Has it really been one year that Michelle has stopped doing videos?? It seems like an eternity ago😢
What about calendula oil?
Love you... 😍😘😘
beautiful video beautiful women, I hope you're well Michelle!
What about moringa oil?
We miss you...
Back when our girl Michelle was the one and only beauty genius of our time... now it's all these newcomers, ugh.
Very good!!!!!
Please note: you CAN overdo coconut oil. If your hair starts to get crunchy, switch to an oil with less protein... protein overload is so often overlooked. Just like you can overdo protein you can also overdo moisture.  If your hair is spongy and stretchy, look for products that give you a protein boost..
Great video! Thanks.
This is so useful! :)
actually washing your mouth with an oil been proven not to do anything but possibly attract bacteria, its been a phenomena is Hollywood and many dentist and other oral practitioners do not recommend it....
This may be a stupid question, but I've heard castor oil should only be used on fine hair, which is presumably found in the African American race. Is this true? I have thin and fine hair, but no wear near the african american texture. I hope this makes sense.
I love oils!
Oily people will want oils that are higher in linoleic acid, like grapeseed oil, sesame oil, evening primrose oil, and rosehip oil. Drier people will want oils higher in oleic acids, like apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil, sweet almond oil. You can buy these oils from Whole Foods, Sprouts, GNC, or Vitamin Shoppe and practically any health food store.
I miss the old Michelle
For the body, should I mix argan oil into the Organic/botanical/authentic body wash or any body wash can?
I hate being greasy
I use these all the time
hi mam can I use grapeseed oil on my face my skin is dry and sometimes irritation and itchiness occurs
I miss you and your videos so much, mich :( these days everyone is ALL about oils and of course being the beauty goddess that you are, YOU were one of the first if not the first beauty guru who has repped the use of beauty oils from the start (as shown from this video). I really hope that you'll bounce back soon. Miss you, michh!! hopefully you're doing well.
What about ezcema and icthiyosis skin what oil can i use to bring the inflammation down?
Ohyes
where is she?I miss her
Is this Michelle? She look very different
you’re the only one (besides doctors of course!) that i trust with info like this!!
Choosing a facial oil is really easy. I'll just cut to the chase. Oily people = Chose a oil high in linoleic acid. Dry people = Chose a oil high in oleic acid. That's it! All you need to do now is google for the oil high in these acids.
I wonder why she doesn't post anymore :/ I miss her
If you apply oil to wet hair, wouldn't the oil and water just repel each other?
😍😍😍😍😍
Which oil is best for Wrinkles??
Is this even Michelle Phan anymore lol. Came back to her channel after years to see where she is now and she doesn't even look like the same person
I'm just starting videos I would appreciate if you could check them out I would love some feed back thanks
hey guys. I need a little help here.I have combination skin (this winter my skin have been SO DRY and dehydrated). Argan oil, jojoba oil, or rosehip oil? I have blackheads and big pores. But I heard that rosehip can clog my pores, argan oil too, so the winner is jojoba.Any opinion ?
Love this

I HAVE THAT BODY OIL AT 03:31 It's Too Cool For School's Egg Body Oil :) Love it!
i have the worst hair every;/ they are long , have split ends even though i dont use heat much, like mabey one a month ,  they are wavey , but not curly and not straight, they are super thin also ;/ what should i do? and they are super dry and extremly frizzy , pls help! im actually crying ;/
I use lavender oil, and omg, it makes your hair smell amazing while growing quickly, and thickening, and it doesnt attract muisqitos since its lavender, so no need to worry about ur hair smelling su fab that bugs must live in it
Miss you, Mish!!<3

coconut oil for coarse or curly hair? no way. Thin or sleek hair love coconut oil, thicker and fluffier hair shouldn't use it, its molecules ale too small for hair pores of curly and coarse hair and they just blow them up from the inside. But it's not always a rule of course, however they shouldn't use coconut oil and look for oils with bigger particles.
Can anyone sorta describe what she did to her hair in this????
2018?🌹
wheres my almond oil?
hi michelle! there are a lot of brands on the market (around the world) so what kinds of oil should i use for skin-applying?!

Beautiful Video xxx
I really love ur video....
Hey Michelle
Hi Michelle, my girlfriend loves you and you inspire her and make her happy. Anyway, in 3:17 you mention adding a few drops of argon or olive oil into your favorite body wash. Can you please tell me what that favorite body wash of yours is? Thank you!

Hey Michelle, would you mind considering an updated kpop star makeup look as a video idea?

How do you do Michelle's bomb hairstyle tho
I learn more from Michelle's video than I do in school
what about tea tree oil?
does anyone know how Michelle's hairstyle is called? it's so cute!
Who else thinks that michelle looks like rachelle ann go🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻🦄
thanks but the acne oil is debatable et needs proof from people who experienced. like poor person broke out from manuka honey. with these acne help from oil, I truly get professional help. from dermatologist.
for oily skin you wont mix oilet foundation on a hot summer day et becareful on winter day for oily skin. oily skin can still get acne on winters day. As for the oil to treat acne dont push luck maybe it can cause more acne.
Great.....
Omg that girl with black curls.. that tresses!!!
MICHELLE. You never fail to motivate me, THANK YOU SO MUCH
Thank you so much for having me as a part of your video! :) It was such an amazing experience ever!!!
Loved this! I use coconut oil for almost everything!
HEMP OIL I swear by this as a moisturizer for acne prone skin!! I had very bad cystic acne and after using raw unrefined hemp oil (I buy it on amazon) my acne is practically gone
I use good ole coconut oil for everything
Your videos make me so relaxed!
Miiishhh! Please add a video about how you organize aaaall your makeup and beauty products! I need a little bit of help since I joined Ipsy last year haha +Michelle Phan

I'm surprised tea tree oil was not mentioned!

What about sunflower oil? I use it as an alternative night time moisturiser.

Very informative! Beautiful girls :)
This Is so calming !!
The body shop has a range of oils that are so good for dryness and are organic
I love jojoba oil on my face! It's pretty much the only thing I use
If I begin using some of these oils for my body, face, and hair at a young age, would that mean my skin in the future will be healthier?
Hey, would love to know more about the Too cool for school egg mousse body oil, it looks amazing :) xxx

How can my eyelashes grow longer
Omg Ellen!!!!!!
I miss her old video but im starting to like this now
What product did they use for the eyebrows
Great video. I am a big oils fan. However, we all have different skin types, so some oils may be too heavy. Remember to patch test! Also, I recommend essential oils for aromatherapy. I have been so stressed lately with college (dead week) and have been using peppermint essential oil to help myself concentrate. Just a little sniff does the trick ;) (sounds gross out of context lawlz).
Wonderful video ❤
Could you make an update of skin care routine for oily acne prone skin? You haven't make one in months
I'm not sure if you'll see this, but I was hoping you would talk more about essential oils, maybe in your next video?
The quality of your videos is incredible!! - Awesome video as always <3
❤️ Mastering the art of moisturising - would be so helpful! ❤️
Oils have been one of the best things for my acne prone/oily skin. My skin has never been better. I absolutely loved how this video was filmed and everyone in the video has gorgeous hair! ❤️✨
Wow !! Loved this .. Please talk about essentials oils , use , how to , or precautions !!Love you xx

Michelle, it's such a good thing that you encourage natural ways to care for our beauty. :)
It's definitely a good part of the way to redefine your path.

ELLEN V LORA FANS WHERE U AT
What kind of cleansing oil would you recommend to use to take off all your makeup? My skin is a little sensitive and is prone to inflammation of the product is too harsh or heavy
Great Video! I love using coconut oil and almond oil for my hair and face:)
I didn't even know about some of these oils and what they can do for the body! Great video :)
hey could you give advice for waxing facial hair or bikini area and just your favorite techniques.
I love how you include everyone not just white women with long straight hair and you're one of the only beauty youtubers who does this it just makes me happy
Love Your Videos michelle!
Can I just use the virgin grape seed oil that would typically be found in a grocery store ?
I wet my palms a bit with plain water after applying facial oil. Then I go back over my face & neck. The water helps to spread the facial oil and pretty much gets rid of the oily, shiny phase of using facial oil.
Why is the music so creepy
Ellen V Lora is my bae ♥

Jojoba oil helped me with my adult acne, its been a month that ive been using it and i had a break out at the beginning but now all is vanishing. oils for life, i use them everyday and anywhere
Mastering the art of Photography pleaseee. :)
Every women in this video are beautifuulll..
Perfect timing. I was wanting to incorporate more oils into my skin/beauty care and this was extremely helpful.
Michelle Phan : Can you make a video on natural or brand facial products that remove acne? FOR MEN AND WOMAN ♡
can we talk about how soothing/calming michelle's voice is?
I love all your videos @Michelle_Phan
ELLEN V LORA <3
I have a lot of guy friends who ask me for oil advice for their beards! What would you recommend? Where would we start?
Can you do a makeup tutorial?
Thanks on the tips
I really liked this video because oils are so good for you and not given enough credit or attention. Thanks Michelle!
how about maracuja oil?
I have an itchy, dry scalp. Do any of these oils work to fix that? Love this btw!
She puts sooo much effort on her videos, we really appreciate it michelle.I love you soo much!!
Does anyone know what brand the hair dryer is or where to find it?
Which oils are appropriate for nails and helping them strengthen?
Your models are so hot
What kid tlc
Can you suggest some brands that are good? I have rosacea. Its very difficult to find things that don't irritate it.
I seriously don't know where she finds all of these absolutely beautiful and flawless women!!
Michelle your videos never disappoint me!! I love 'em so much and such high quality!! <3
This is awesome. Love the diversity in this video! #girlpower 😊😊😊
Karinaaaaaaa 😍😍😍🔥😍😍😍 yesssss
What I learned? When you got no makeup on, make sure your hair is on point.
That production value tho
what can i use tea tree oil for? :)
I was expecting tea tree oil too :(
Pls do a hair tutorial!! Love your braids
Love!!!!
eye  liner bc I  don't know how to do my own
I love your hairstyle 💕
You didn't include pomegranate oil, raspberry oil which is an SPF and macadamia nut oil
Could you do a tutorial with your favorite hairstyles or hairdos? I love the one you are wearing in the video... :D
you looooook fantabulous in the thumbnail. what is your shampoo mish?
Hi Michelle! I love that you featured different types of women in your video. :)
biết chị đã lâu giờ mới đc dịp xem clip....michelle người mỹ gốc việt hehe
Guys which is the last oil for the teeth?
I like coconut oil, I put it on my face before I go to sleep and wash it off in the morning, I also add castor oil on my brows.  And in the morning, I use coconut oil as a mouthwash before I wash my teeth. It's supposed to clear your body from toxins and it helps prevent cavities, as well as makes you have whiter teeth and a nice breath. Also, I buy the coconut oil from an organic store, it's cold pressed and virgin. It means it has more of the good healing stuff in there than the ones you get from the supermarket.
relaxing voice😴😴
Ur voice is so soothing
I just love how she includes women with all skin tones and body types in her videos🙌🏽💕
When my internet speed is really crappy and I'm playing literally every video at 144p. I wait for hours, just so that I can watch her video at at least 720p. Because Michelle Phan deserves to be watched in HD. :D
Love ❤️ love ❤️ love ❤️ miss you
why does michelle look like hilary duff when she smiles,, is this only me
i wish i had money to be cool
"Came in looking really ratchet and I came out feeling like a majestic dark unicorn" 🦄
I love how she always uses many different looking women to represent the trends. Not the same type of woman which is always shown in medias nowadays
The only problem I have with bodysuits is going to the bathroom is a nightmare!
Where is your signature "good luck" ??😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔
Congrats on your webcomic Michelle! Love how she resembles some of you! Great trend report and loved the camera perspective. Felt more personal. Hope all is well :)
Actually that goat's milk cream is by brand Ziaja - which is brand from Poland ;) yay! I love that brand so much because it's not tested on animals and mostly vegan (goats milk in this series is synthetic) :) and sooo good for my skin, and very inexpensive in Poland :)
Not all liquid lipsticks are eye safe!!! The Jeffree Star ones are but not all and I would NOT be recommending this to people who don't know this!
im a creature?... 💭
guy tang only takes famous clients
You should do a dark unicorn inspired makeup look (:
Was so fun to be a part of this!! I cannot wait to see April's Trend Report :)
i love the models in michelle's videos
OMG she called me beautiful creature! MISH YOURE THE PERFECT CREATURE
I love the geometric cranes on your dresser!
Sidenote, I appreciate the diversity displayed by your models/interns. Super important message about inclusion and representation!
I got a Michelle Phan ad before this... Lol
I always thought liquid lipsticks make great liquid eyeliners. They're opaque, long wearing, and super matte dry. -_- I prefer it as eyeliner.
i love these trend reports!
Wow the hair colour is amazing! Definitely gonna look into Guy Tang!
When she is Goals and I look like a potato 😱👍
when will Michelle make another makeup video because we've gotten pillow talk and trend report 2 times in the last 4-5 videos
light up shoes yasss!! Michelle, your hair looks GORGEOUS! fell in love as soon as I saw it on Snapchat
Is anyone else convinced Michelle has a secret fountain of youth somewhere?? She doesn't look older than when she started her channel!
How do people use the bathroom with a body suit when they're wearing tons of layers and really gotta pee?!
No one cares if you're part of the "notification squad."
WHO ELSE LOVES GUY TANG???? 💗
Where did you get the shirt your wearing here? It's so cute
I love the braided hairstyles so much!!! You girls look fabulous.
When the last makeup tutorial was 2 months ago and I followed this for makeup.
I love trend report series sooo much!
And the liquid lipstick idea is amazing!
I'd love a video on how she curls her hair. It's always so perfect
THATS JEFFREE STAR LIQUID LIPSTICK IN BLUE VELVET AND BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S
I love the trend reports legit look forward to them all the time ❤️❤️ 
Gorgeous as always xx
I wish I could like this video 1000 times because you always have so many different looking girls showcase trends. We do not all look the same and seeing videos that show the same trend on different body types is amazing. THANK YOU!!
Who else loves her hair? 😍😍😍😍
Michelle you are just so talented. All of your videos are so original and absolutely beautiful to watch. keep up the good work mish! ❤️
The Asian girl with  grey theme is sooo pretty! 😻😱 Loved this update mish!
Ugh Michelle your videos are always great and full of information! Love youuu💘😭
OMG! Your hair is AMAZING! I want my hair to look like yours (for real)!
Your voice is so therapeutic ❤️❤️❤️
So proud of Kim! <3 Yay Ipsy girls!
Omg I love your hair!! It looks so pretty for one to have!! 😍
3:02 she is so gorgeous, its so great to see someone with a similar body type as mine. is she a model?
Good video but pleaseee don't forget that braids aren't a 'trend', its apart of a culture and its not something that disappears after  its not appealing anymore.
I love how she always has girl in all shapes and colors in her videos 😻
LOL at Michelle calling her hair "ratchet" at one point..... girl..... what?
anyone know an alternative to snug, for android users? <3
omg who is that girl with the braided silver hair?! she's just so cute! her smile is heart melting! so beautiful!
Oh my gosh your voice!  like I could play all your videos just listening to your voice haha it's weird but soooo relaxing
Pause, hold up 👋🏾 hi there. HOW TF ARE BRAIDS TRENDS. HOW MICHELLE HOW😑
how are you so pretty! You look like a model! Why can't I look like that! Love you!
I never heard of oil slick! I'm going to have to try it. I'm really looking for another way to get temporary color.
thank you for using a range of women in your videos!!! it's lovely to see someone more curvy fabulously rock a bodysuit or what a lipstick colour looks like on a darker tone. i truly appreciate it mish <333 xxx
jUst saying i liked this video for the editing, not the content. ;0 bye!
Congratulations with webtoons comic~
If you wear light up shoes in maryland, you will get roasted. Just saying.
Can we please, talk about how beautiful she is?! ❤️ Goddess!!
SYAF OTHMAN ILOVEEEEEYOU SOOOO MUUUUCH 😍😍😍😙😘
Anyone else's Siri go off when she said "This year?" 😂
I love that I can trust this video because she isn't sponsored most types of videos are almost always sponsored which makes it hard for you to know if they actually believe what they are saying or if they just want to push the product
Aren't backwards Dutch braids just cornrows? 🤔
no, they are not coming up with different types of braids
they are learning them from other cultures

dont appropriate other cultures by giving credit were credit is due
I wonder how much it would be just for Guy Tang to do your hair 🙈
I love these series!!
Totally my fav <3 x
I'm always taken aback by how calming your voice is ❤
Hair goals🙆🏻
michelle, i LOVE this style of video!!! these feel so personal and direct. i haven't been very good about keeping up on your channel the last little while but i've been subscribed for a good 4 years and it's cool to see the progress you've made. thanks 4 continuing to be fuckin awesome ;0
I love how d models r nt skinny !
I dont know why but michelle kind of reminds me a bit of Hilary duff ^^
Your hair is the most magical thing I've ever seen, I swear !
I always loves Michelle's trend report 😍
whenever I see the ☔ I think BMTH
Yessss I love trend report so much!!!
So much time and effort is put into each and every video! 🙂
Michelle Phan's videos are always so clean and neat! :)
This series is my fav ❤️
You are my favorite beauty youtuber!!💕💕💕please never quit!!
Why does her voice give me peace? anyone else or is it just me? 😂
I love how the body types of the girls in this video varied and looked like normal people instead of models, these videos are such good quality I love them omg
That oil slick hair looks amazing! I would love to try it out! Guy Tang did a great job 😍
Michelle I love your book and I did a report in it and I got a a+! I love you so much!
Does anyone know where her top is from?? I loveeee it
I love you Michelle!!❤️❤️You are 100%my role model/ idol and the best person on the world!!
#n.1fan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💟💟💟
Light up shoes are so 2015!!!! Everyone had them in the beginning of 2015.
AMAZING video Chi! Everyone behind this video is amazing! So thankful I got to be apart of it. See you next time. :) Ps: LOVE THE HAIR!
I WANNA KNOW WHERE SHE GOT HER TOP
This woman is her own Youtube Level. Like, the scale isn't on ONE to TEN, it's on a scale of ONE to MICHELLE PHAN (of course, Michelle being the best!)
This video was very aesthetically pleasing
her videos make me feel so calm and inspired i love them x
4:20 I thought that was stephen curry's wife.
Where can I buy the black top/blouse/sweater/whatever Michelle is wearing? It's beautiful!
omg your glove(???) is messing with my eyes
looks really cool tho
I see how braids are "in" now but please thank us black women for that. Just saying.
love your makeup & skincare videos so much~ (>•<)/♡ thank you Michelle~~~
t.o.p need to download that snug apps instead of posting and deleting photos all the time, lol. and that light up shoes always emind me of saligo~ saligo~ saligosaligosaligo~~
I've noticed that fashion has really been inspired by the '90s
gahhhhhhhh
editing goals!!!
I used to be a fan, now I'm an air conditioner
So the trends are pretty much inspired by Jelena Karleuša and CL. ❤
Your voice is so amazingly soft and relaxing. 😍
Plz do makeup tutorials again...
I love you Michelle Phan.
You are my inspiration. 😃
Please do a braids tutorial!
 Love your videos. <3
Ha! It took me some time to see your finger glove so cute! Thank you for putting some of your favorite products in the I pay bags! Send more mascara plz!!!!😘
SO PRETTY!!! i really wonder, what kind of apps that do you use to edit your instagram photo mish? like the rainbow color filter that i am talkin' bout. i hope you see my comment (i hope). salam from indonesia
I know change is important to move on but I kinda liked her old videos more. And by that i mean the make up transformations. her sailor mooon tutorial still gives me life haha xD 
the new videos aren't bad though.
Lysm❤️❤️❤️ your makeup game is on point
Mish! you look thinner. take care.
"A majestical unicorn"
Snug!! That's exactly what I needed!!
why are you wearing a smudge guard
I SAW YOU IN MONTREUX, SWITZERLAND😭❤️😍
Love that term Dark Unicorn 🤘🏽🦄
Loved this so much!! 
Loving braids so much they are adorable^^
OMG YOUR HAIR!  I would keep it that color it's gorgeous
Could you possibly make a video on scalp and hair hygiene and how to keep your scalp smelling fresh throughout the week without constantly washing it. Even when I use dry shampoo I still feel that you scalp is dirty, I used to be able to wash my hair every week but now it starts getting really oily by the second day, maybe more nature ways to do so? I know many people struggle with this and I believe your advice would be very helpful. Thank you!!
or hair is beautiful 
Guy Tang sure is talented with hair💇❤
First off, haven't seen you in 3 years!  Second, peel off makeup is a great concept and will sell well. Finally, the Lumee case is a huge win.
I love you Michelle you're such an inspiration to me xx
Informative beauty vlogger? Michelle Phan is the best!
Your hair looks amazing!! And I'm excited to check out your webtoon! 😄😄
Is there an alternative to braids for short hair??
@Michelle Phan I really like your shirt!😍 can you tell me where it's from! I need it!!😱😱😱😱😱❤️❤️
Thank you for the trend report💕 You look beautiful as always😍❤️
I admire you so much Michelle!! ❤️
I'm so happy she didn't say boxer braids coz that's not what they are called, and I'm happy she didn't act like its a new hairstyle like it just came out.
The hair and the outfit are beautiful~. Just saying~. 😎

See ya~!
I love that Michelle doesn't always show her face she also shoes examples and beautiful small  videos
Thanks for the update! :D I always look forward to the trend reports hehe! I love that bay-max phone case <3
Adore Trend Report!!! 🙌🙌💕
To me the a "body suit" will always be a leotard
Are you even doing beauty tutorials I need to know
Like always, loved it! Thanks, Michelle! ❤
That outro song gives me the feels every time ! Love it <3

Tbh, the gram gallery is my fav ❤️ Love you!!
How can we pee in bodysuit... Just wonder
i love watching michelle phan's videos high af😍
you are just perfect! you talk about make up but are so natural at the same time I LOVE YOU💕
Ummmm Michelle braids are not a trend, it's a part of African culture we've been doing for years😌
I read your webtoon! It had me crying! So magical - can't wait for the next chapter! xx
Wish I could get an ipsy bag but I'm from the UK 😞
wait that's YOUR webcomic?!?!? WOW It's super pretty!!
I read the first chapter and fell in love with all of the beautiful colors!
Why is it every time I watch your videos I become instantly inspired? You're amazing!
cornrows aren't so much a trend
Totally love this 😍 everything I need to know is here
Yas, I want Guy Tang's Mother of Pearl: pastel pink, blue, and lilac!

HOW CAN ONE BE THIS BEAUTIFUL?!?
Hi Michelle Phan!

Love you Michelle Phan 😘
Hi Michelle :) your voice is very relaxing. Love you u.u
I love these trend videos you make!! Do more please! Love you ❤
Petition for Michelle to do clothing hauls because I seriously want to steal her wardrobe 😍

you're my inspiration (´ε｀ )♡
I love your outro song so much idk why! I'm always replaying it lol
KIM!!! I LOVE HER!! & such a beautiful video ❤️
mercari is a great selling one cause its free e.e they dont take a percentage out
is there an android version for Snug!!
Intricate looking things when they are knotted?? lol I was like what
I love you 💜
where is my "good luck" :((
I love that braids have become popular again! They give you a lot of creative freedom and aren't as damaging to your hair since many styles don't require heat : )
Wait, taking selfies with lumees cases when those people were recording on their phone???!!
i dont follow trends. Im more modern/vintage and i like being  me.
can you pls do a makeup tutorial on this? it looks so gorgeous on you😍
+Michelle Phan Would love to see your everyday makeup routine. Keep up the good work! ✌
Michelle, you're dressed like a mystical space princess because you are a mystical space princess. 😍
You forgot depop as a consignment shop
I love this video so much! And honestly, who needs therapy when they can just watch your videos? Your voice is so soothing, and all of these are pretty trendy! ILYSM, you're the best!! <3
JEFFREE STAR MAKEUP THO 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Diy chockers would be an awesome video 😃✨
guy tang is a hair magician but his personality makes me put his vids on mute
I am very happy to have found this channel! 
I usually am a little behind with fashion since I live in a small town in Germany and trends don't come here until there are out of fashion, so it's really nice to see a summarised video of trends to keep up with the cool kids 😊😎😉
Will the Glam bag be soon in Europe (especially switzerland)??
I've never heard them called "no bra bras" only Bralets. Where did you even hear them called that?
Loved the multicolored hair , so unique 💕
OMG I absolutely LOVE your outfit!!!♡♡♡
Mish so beautiful💜💜
SHES WEARING THAT THING FROM HELIOS FEMINA!!! I WANT ONE!

I love you Michelle💜 I am so happy you are getting to do your dreams and you inspire me so much ☺️😍😘
Kinda random, but I love her outro for some reason, it's so relaxing with that music lol
You're my FAV youtuber!!!!
I can listen to your voice all day... it's so soothing and relaxing!! 💟💋💟
I don't care what other people say , I love your newer videos and don't think you should ALWAYS have to make make up tutorials, however , I do enjoy them too and hope that you don't stop doing them completely ! {^•^} love ya Mish! Keep dreaming!

Syaf othman!!!!!!  She is super gorgeous!!! Like how!!!
Your hair is AMAZING Michelle!
"I like to file on the harder side" lip bite @ 10:14 

wth was going on there Michelle, hahaha
Not a fan of the liquid lipstick as eyeliner one xD Probably because I hate any eyeliner color besides black. I love all of the others, though!
😢 what happened to saying good luck after EVERY video??
Hair goals! 😻
Michelle, I'm so glad to see so many different body shapes in your trend report! Beautiful!
Ziaja is the best Polish brand! It's very unexpensive and mosty vegan, non tested on animals. It's my favorite and I'm proud of my country :D Pozdrawiam polskie widzki  <3
I've never heard of the "oil slick hair" thing....what the heck? That's what that's called??? I thought it was just dying your hair crazy colors
Love every single trend up on here 😍❤️
that hair is so beautiful omg
Great vid, Michelle, these trend reports are always fun and interesting. And I love the outro. The music and graphics are so neat:)
Ugh I love the color but I can't dye my hair yet 💔

THIS! This is the kind of trend I like and I'm usually lazy in trying new trends but the oil slick hair is definitely something I would love to try out! The peel-off make up is something I've been doing for a while now ever since I discovered WishTrendTV <3

Braids have always been 'in' with black women tho- it's not a new 'trend' 😐
Congratulations on your webcomic release!!! I really liked this trend report, I've been eyeing that goat's milk cream! hugs, Claire
This just reminded me to file my taxes...thanks girl
where is Michelle's top from? it's TOOOOOOOOO cute 😍
you are inspiring michelle. ♡
Michelle I seriously wish I could pull off that beautiful mermaid hair you have going on!

Btw Im trying to reach 2k and i work super hard on my channel to make people laugh and have fun. Do you mind supporting my Youtube endeavors? :)
I love bodysuit, but the only problem of it is that when you go used the bathroom and you have to take everything off just to go pee. that's like my only issue. lol.
i am a creature. thank you Michelle for not making me feel like a have to be a human! (no sarcasm intended)  I LOVE YOU MICHELLE
She didnt say good luck omg
I appreciate this video! Thanks Mish!

Hey Michelle! Question. Where did you get that lovely long sleeve cover up? <3<3
Backward dutch braids? You mean cornrows?
KIMMMMM YASSSSSSS
Omfg i love her top 💘
LuMee is life, i had it for 1 year now! it's so good!!
i didn't get it when she said "first world problems" . Regardless, this is awesome
is no one going to mention the very obvious advertisements in there? I haven't watched her videos in like two years, but is this really it??
Is it your chocker stolen from a window?
I love the hair idea, i always want to change My color but i don't want something some extreme, so that's really what i was looking for <3
Waiting for a new trend report today and a new comic!
Who else was waiting for their Instagram usernames to show up?
love the hair omg
KIM THAI <3
Goats milk? Really Michelle? You're the kind of person I'd expect to be vegan
Michell can you do a makeup tutorial soon?
I remember your channel being the first I subscribed to when I made an account and now I'm reading your webcomic. It's amazing how far you've come and I know you'll continue to go further. Congratulations! Oh, and the artwork is phenomenal :3
I'm seriously in love with everything about Michelle Phan omfg... I want her hair lol~ Michelle if you see this, you're so beautiful and inspiring :-)
Depop is also a good clothing selling app :)
Poshmark app almost made me loose on my photos on my phone :'(
It was crashing my photo gallery. I had to plug my phone in to my computer and delete the poshmark photo album... scarrryyyy meng! I hope they fix this because I really like how the community is.
Your shirt tho! 😱 Where did you get it?? :D
You forgot to mention depop! For selling clothes
I LOVE HER FASHION. PERIOD.
I notice you go back and forth between phones, but which one do you recommend. I have a Galaxy S5 and I was looking at the s7 edge, you have a galaxy in one video and an iPhone in the next video do you use one or do you use both. You seem to love tech stuff so I wanted your opinion. YOU COULD PROBABLY MAKE A VIDEO😃
I just screamed at the top of my lungs coz I loveeee trend reports ❤️👏🏻

What is that thing you are wearing on your hand? Is it the thing that makes your hand slide smoothly over a graphic tablet (Wacom)?
I love how body suits are just fancy leotards

Dry shampoo, yes. Life saver to not damage the hair! Bad to wash it everyday. :)

Are there any android apps related to snug? I can't find that app anywhere
Humid climate is when the air is very moist and it contains a lot of water vapor. If you live in a dry climate it's definitely not humid.

Dear Michelle, I really love your videos and I've been subscribing your channel for years!! You look amazing as always and your voice is really relaxing... 😍 I'd be glad if you could do more make up tutorials because in my opinion, you are the only YouTuber that does beautiful makeup tutorials! Thank you!! I love you! xx
OMG I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING!
I love her hair and she's is really smart and beautiful
I Looooooove her hair during the chocker cut away. They're like spacebuns but like a victory roll? Just lovely
Could you possibly make a video on scalp and hair hygiene and how to keep your scalp smelling fresh throughout the week without constantly washing it. Even when I use dry shampoo I still feel that you scalp is dirty, I used to be able to wash my hair every week but now it starts getting really oily by the second day, maybe more nature ways to do so? I know many people struggle with this and I believe your advice would be very helpful. Thank you!!
I need the shoes!!!!
i love watching your videos.
these "no bra bras"...some tips for websites where i can buy rlly nice of these? best with worldwide ship :)
where did you get your top and the long sleeve portion of it ?
LIKE then watch ☺️❤️
Braids have always been a trend..... And multiple braids are called cornrows
please do a room tour, your backgrounds are so pretty 😍😍
I liked depop more than poshmark tbh
Doesn't anyone think it's dangerous to apply makeup with long nails
♡♥♡ Michelle~ I love your hair so much
I love your videos sm 💕
that baxmax phonecase 😍😍😍😍
Love the trend report , keep going on this topic
（≧∇≦）
i really want your tops
Anyone else notice she didn't say "Good Luck." At the end of the video?
Michelle is so beautiful and positive that she is giving me positive vibes from one end to the other end of the world!
Dear Michelle, I just want to let you know that you are the truest, coolest and everything else that's great, YouTuber :'D! You inspire me to do greater things, and I thank you for that! Despite the busy lifestyle, I thank you for taking your time and making great great great content!!! You make me happier everytime I see you either on here, instagram, ads, magazines and even on airplanes! :-) Thank you so much for the great inspiration you give us <3

love this trend video because I can't choose one who is good for me....all I want to try and suitable for my character! Oil sleek hair (totally love color choice!), no bra-bras, and that argan oil..
What about Depop??
Lord i need money 😭😭😭
Could you do a transformation video for us soon?  Maybe Rihanna, or  Sia
MICHELLE there is a newest trend about hair which is rose gold tone inspired by the iPhone rose gold tone...
Light up shoes :D
The peel off makeup is a huge but creative trend!
KIM! love her!
that place where the love robbery shoots their mv
she didn't say good luck!!!
why dry shampoo do u recommend?
I lately see comment trends saying, "where you (blank) squad?" 😂😂
any alternative for snug?
do a goddamn make up tutorial
Nice trend report, those light up shoes ; I would ;) 1990 baby represent
What top and glove are you wearing in this video? I love IT!!!!!!!!
Hey Michelle, I was wondering, do you still edit your own videos? <3 It would be so cool if you still do :)
None of those braid styles were created by them.
Not just anybody, beyonces makeup artist created the design 😄
You're not supposed to buff your nails or file your nails in a see saw motion
i wish i just had someone to make braids in my hair all the time bc i am NOT able to do anything but the basic braid. its really sad
I love this Trend Report video series! ❤️Don't stop!
You should sell the Ipsy Bag worldwide! My sister is such a huge fan of yours and I would love to buy her the Ipsy Bag but It won't ship to Europe! :(
where is the top youre wearing from??
she gets prettier everyday  how is that possible😍
Braids is the greatest of  all time hair trend.
There was a Michelle Phan ad before this feel xD
i have a nail file like that but mines a 7 in 1
michelle my little sister wants to make a comic about you called''michelle's plan''. and april 1 is here birthday she is turning 10 so if you can, can you say happy birthday to her she lllooovvveess yyoouu. and you can make a lipstick like glossy eye shadow . And she just said your da best
Kim Thai♡♥♡
Thank you Michelle! I love these trend reports! <3
omg, one of those girls is a dead ringer from Ayesha Curry.
.. I got excited cause I saw jkissa .. not crazy about Michelle,  she's a passionate woman but .. meh
did she not say good luck?
Am I the only one that feels really calm while watching Michelles videos?
Also,one week without washing hair..YOU RAWK GIRL! I wash them every 3-5 days cause I want to keep them as healthy as possible,less heat e.t.c My friends find it gross but I think it works perfect for your hair!
I love the oil slick hair!
Isn't it sad that youtubers have to mention that they aren't sponsored?
I couldn't stop staring at your top and trying to figure out how it worked 😂👌 
Great video mish :)
Does anyone know the music from 7:55?
she doesnt have goodluck at the end of this video :(  hahaha still love you michelle <3
Yes I love trend reports!!!!
I absolutely love the models for the bodysuits!
How can you get on the gram gallery??
Michelle where did you get your outfit or shirt?
Omg its syafothman frm Malaysia!!!!
I'm so early this has never happened before, mama look I've accomplished something!
Luv the light up shoes
I really really love Trend Report!!! we'll never go out of style again!
light up shoes trended well over a year ago but...... sure i guess theyre still cute
On your hand.. Is that a glove or part of your shirt? I seriously love it!
I wish snug was available for android, but I'll definitely do a preview of my instagram feed from now on anyway! I found out that VSCO cam is a good app to see how the feed will look😄. The video was sooo cool!!
That clothe trading app is such a good idea! They should make an app where u can swap international snacks haha ooooo or make up!
I miss mish+dom videos
did anyone notice that she didn't say good luck at the end of the video?
I love your hair!!!
the lumee case was cool but my phone already has a front selfie light and you can choose how bright it is
Braids have been around for centuries honey
Link to her chocker that she's wearing?
I know you have your web cartoon but id like to see a video about your drawings!
Good work  👍👍

Might you have a good response to our video and also let me know what you would think as I do think you may have an eye for it
Love the ad too

I thought you were missing fingers

I really want those shoes...
Can i just be the one to say that i love Michelle's style
I'm happy i'm not the only girl who washes her hair once a week!
does anyone know an android alternative to snug?

I read your chapters of Helios Femina and fact(if you didn't know):in islam if you kill one person,it's like you kill all people,if you save one it's like you saved all...reminded me of your saying...😁😁😁
I LOVE YOU MICHELLE!💜💘☯️
YESSSSSSSSS

Are you wearing hair extensions in this video? Xx
I am a Chinese and I can tell you those are not mandarin colors!The colors are:
Red=Luck and Happiness
Yellow=Earth
Blue=(No meaning but used exclusively for gods)
Gold
Is she still with Dom?
My arm literally gets SO tired while braiding! I wish I could hop on this trend without the whole "I want to die" feeling in my triceps
She should make another asmr video
The choker looks like something that came out of touken ranbu.. Which is a good thing lol

Throughout the video 60% of my concentration was on the "builtin glove with body suit" on two fingers of her...... Hehe it looks kind of cool ✌🏼👍🏼
Before the video the woman in the ad tried to slay

I can't braid my hair because somewhere in the Bible it says not to do it :'c
I luv trend reports please keep this series going this is basically how I keep up with the style lol.
well the only thing I'm caught up on is chokers, light up shoes, "digital doodles", and snapchat 😂
I didn't find snug :(
does anyone know what the decorations  on her desk are called?
For part of the photo  to shoot did you go to lacma for it
BAYMAX PHONE CASE.

There is also Depop & Etsy are also great ways to buy sell &/or trade.
What about Depop? :)
Hey Michelle, where are the sleeves from?
Where is the glove from she is wearing? :O
Your hair is life!
Who dislikes Michelle Phan
I have them shoes like 2 years
Ugh michelle i'm trying to conserve my money
What are you wearing on your right hand? It looks soo cool!
Michelle Phan is a prime example that you don't have to sell out to make money.
Wowwwwwwwwwww your hair is so wonderful
kin thai! yassss
I have light up shoes
OMG, Michelle, where did u get that top?! I LUV IT!!!!!!!!!!
is that the cintiq glove you wear? qwq
I love you
Love you Michelle
Isn't this a repeat?
Braids don't suit me at all
She's wearing an artist's glove! They're used to keep the screen of drawn by tablets clean, and allowing the artist to rest their hand without messing up the artwork.
+michelle phan You're beautifully enchanting
Have a vlogging channel
Jkissa slaying as always
I love these videos! 😍😍😍
Aren't the clothing apps just for fashion line names, though?
I'm pretty sure Michelle Phan is beside Slay in the dictionary, she slays it all, business, aesthetic, fun, beauty, professionalism
you and one of the girls are wearing the same chocker
What tablet was the person drawing on?
I don't see any makeup tutorials. Only one that was about 6 weeks ago or something.
Where did you get your top. It looks just like the one in your webtoon.
Yeah body suits seem cool until you need the toilet you basically have to take of all your clothes before you Can go to the toilet 😂❤️
who is the girl at 04:05? ^^

I NEED SOME LIGHT UP SHOES IN MY LIFE!!

i dyed my hair a lot and my scalp get really hurt and well it's terrible...but well, i can't stop dyeing it tbh.. can someone give me tips on how to prevent scalp damage and stuff?
What is that music at the very emd of the video? It's beautiful
It looks like wengie on the thumbnail
What happened to "Good Luck"?
No bra bras and light up shoes are quite last year
I wish I knew where Michelle got the light up shoes from I'm really digging them
i see you Kim i see you 😎
what happened to ur hand???!!!!
The Helios femina link doesn't work for me :(
I just read Helios femina and I love it the colors are just so beautiful
Michelle!! Don't buff your nails.. It makes you nails thinner and easy to chip :((
Love this trend report deff love the multi colored hair, the shoes, and the apps!
i wear braids like everyday and now that they are a trend I'm not going to wear them anymore... idk what to do I hate wearing things that are trends.. that means a lot of people have it as well
🌸
@elianamarji
Goddd I love your videos so muchhhhhhh
Oh Michelle I love your trend reports, so much interesting stuff in one video! Love from Austria!
What's on your lips?? omg it looks so good on you :D love your trend reports!
She didn't say good luck! How will I succeed in life now?! 😂😂😂 Jokes aside, I am happy to see trend reports cone back.
2:50 where is it?
I love these trend reports! 💕💕 Who else??
Does she still live in nyc?
I have those light up shoes wear them to school everyday lol
I love trend report bc I learn something new each time
the other girl looks a lot like ayesha curry :)
I'm reading Helios Femina, it's such a great story! I have one question though-who is the girl on the front of the website with the space buns? Is she going to be a major character in the story, or is she just a random design that is drawn in the same design as the story? 💖✌️
I love how various body sizes were represented in this video
+michelle I am having a bad night but after seeing this video gives me such a good vibe. I love you and please continue making videos to inspire not just me but millions of people loving you.
I mean she's so cute
chị nói được tiếng iệt chứ
Here for SYAF OTHMANNNNNN ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
For liquid lipstick as eyeliners, does that apply to ANY liquid lipstick or certain brands? I know Jeffree Star works, but just not sure about Colourpop and others.
Watching this make me miss you
I love these videos
OMGG where is the GOOD LUCK...:(
the girl with the gray hair in braids is so pretty
I use a app called selfie shot for front camera flash.
i have oil slick hair!!! i feel so ahead of the trend game
Maybe mention that some lipstick formulas ARENT good for putting near the eyes.  Not to mention the ingredients used to create reds a lot of times irritate eyes.
I love your trend reports!
does anyone else feel like she got more edgy???
i love her make-up :vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
i love what she's wearing
What's on your hand?
Damn did I love this video series
What's the name of the song from 4:20 minute (when she was talking on the case lighters)??? Plz write if you know :)

Do a diy
When is Inkigayo?
Isnt that the place Jungkook had a photoshoot?? (The white  candle poles)
Oh how I wish I had Michelle Phan as my older sister. Being the eldest, its hard to find someone who can help give tips on make up and help me do my hair. Thanks Michelle for being my older sister on YouTube! <3
How do you do the snapchat one?
whats with the half glove thing? is that a trend??
I wanted light up sketchers last year :/ so I guess since light up sneakers are coming back to style, I won't get made fun of :P YAY!
Is she still with Dominic?
I just love that lace choker!! soooo cute!!!
Guy did Joey Graceffa and Daniel's hair too cx
So cute! So Beauty!
I live in France and a few weeks ago light up shoes were forbidden in a middle school because a light up shoe just started to be on fire (it burned, with flammes)... Don't know where it's going but seemed kinda dangerous... Sorry for my english ;) hope I made myself clear
Love the trend reports !!
Queen
it's just coming from a single parent home, you think you give something to the young moms who don't have all this money to splurge. like I'm not saying anything g on her character. just her business sense. it's kinda silly, if you come from that demographic you'd think you'd still make those type of videos every once in a while. but I wait in vain. well frankly I say screw it.
What was the hair dye thing?
I wish I knew where her outfit is from....
I wish I knew where her outfit is from....
I want to rock the oil slick look...but then I look at my bank account. :'(
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What's one your hand
How the hell do you use the bathroom with a body suit?!?!😰😬😉
Love u❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍💋💋💋💋
did she break up with Dom? he hasn't been in her videos for more than a year.
Of course you would say it's a trend your hair is like this hahaha #fullofyourself
I heard you can't actually 'repair' you hair ends or your hair in general because they're literally dead cells like how you can't bring back a dead person:-)
Yes, work that cultural appropriation with the braids :/
The curtain or whatever that is is in the back is so cool! Where did you get it
Whats with the glove?
❤️❤️❤️
These trend reports are like my version of the news 😍 but this is much more interesting!!!
sound is a little loud? no?
What happened to Dom?
What happened to Dom?
the girl with the freckles is sooo beautiful 😍😍😍 i wish i had freckles too
I'm sad that braids are big this year because I'm too lazy to do braids.
miss you so much
Michelle didn't wish us good luck 😰
who came here thinking it was BMTH
So my boyfriend was listening to this when I was watching and when he heard "adult kids" he freaked out so much and went, "ADULT KIDS?? TEENAGERS??? IS THAT WHAT SHE MEANS???" lol.
Who is in 04:06 ? She so beatiful? What's her name ?
michelle i love you...i really want to buy the ipsy bag but my parents wont allow me beacause they think its humbuck...but i really love it...and you:)
Love your shirt Michelle .
love it mish!!
where's Dom
Srsly Bodysuits 😂 any ballet dancers out there? Leotards are trending!
I broke my $100 light up shoes crying atm
What happened to the boy friend?
Does oilslick hair fade like other coloring does?
That necklace makes her look like she has a really weird silver beard....
Ugh stop with the LACMA shots. Its not that cool. We la natives hate it 🤣
You should check out jernert's feed! !
Is it just me or do you not line your webcomics? It's kinda like a rough sketchy lineart, which makes it harder to color inside the lines. Do you turn off or do you use the pen stabilizer?
thực sự là nhớ chị !! bao giờ chị sẽ tiếp tục vậy  :) em sẽ luôn theo dõi nhớ các clip make up của chị :) 
i really miss you <3 <3 came back soon !!
Where is the white duster coat from?
kiiiim thaiii ugh died from this video
Please subtitles in spanish
I just read Helios Femina and I LOVED IT. 👏🏼👏🏼
About Itsy.. do you ship to Romania now? I wanted to try some of your products for so long, but there was no shipping available to my country :(
I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos when looking at the likes and views they get. She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots
Loveee the diversity of the models in all of her trend report vids!!
How do you spell the two clothes selling apps??
I love trend report
Speaking of Snapchat and MSQRD, there's an app called SNOW you might want to check it out! It even has different filters to choose from!
PLUS SIZE suggestions for bralettes????????
Vinted.com is a great alternative to Poshmark and Tradesy. It's available in multiple countries, not only US, ant they have a super cool app that supports both Android and iOS! :)
Man I miss her.
I did not expect to see in ipsy bag a product made in Poland :D It's big surprise that someone outside my country found this brand (Ziaja) attractive enough to comprise its products in ipsy bag, it makes me happy :)
SYAFFFFFFFFFFFFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
goats milk??????
I want her hair!!!
Do you guys think it would be okay if a boy wore those light shoes?
Snug is only for Iphone? I searched on my app store and found nothing, does anyone know an app that's similar but for android?
the oil slick looks rad and shoes look da bomb, I used have a pair as a kid.
using lipstick on your eyelids can be dangerous....ingredients used for lip products may not be suited for eyes...please be careful when you do this.
Michelle over here sharing her culture with chokers and these people are yelling at her to stop wearing braids because culture apropriation...  :/ I love you mish
If you want to use liquid lipstick as eyeliner do it at your own risk! Many of them are not labeled as safe for eyes so just be careful out there guys
i got a cheap nail file in my ipsy bag😷😒
Gurl ew. Dry shampoo doesn't clean your hair, it only hides the filthiness of your hair by absorbing oils and greases your scalp secretes.
What's up with the werid glove on her hand?
I love trend reports
Michelle, I noticed that you listed the Etude House Dear Darling Tint under the peel-off makeup. This is a normal lip tint, I think you meant the peel-off lip tints from Berrisom or The Saem (probably the former, it's more popular) ^_^
Didn't she used to have 9,000,000 subscribers
Is she still dating Dom
Is she still with Dom
Is she still with Dom
lol body suits are trending? I believe it but they are hella uncomfortable. Body suits are basically a leotartd,  after being a dancer for so long I know the feeling of having all these sweaty layers on and having to strip to go to the restroom uggg. . .
What if I want to pee wearing the body suit? hahaaha
What brand are the light up shoes from
I feel like wearing a body suit would prompt be to avoid washroom use at all cost lol How annoying it would be to wear.
0:00 did she just told us creature?
2:48 
all I can think: BTS BTS BTS BTS BTS BTS BTS BTS kajlkdjfkaljfkjdsakfhkjds Oh my god
The goat milk cream from Ziaja is actually really popular in Poland. Ziaja is one of the cheapest brands here, they have some good products, but you have to be careful, because most of their moisturizers are thick and contains lots of mineral oil.
What's the glove thing about????
I would say sarees, and the jewels that come with it, basically anything Indian and beautiful is becoming a trend
I had a michelle phan advertisement while watching a michelle phan video
It isn't safe to use lip products around your eyes. You risk staining, at worst, expect itchy, red eyes.

And the way you, and the models, use that nail file is incorrect. Filing in both directions will fray your nails. Only file in one direction.

 Michelle has no excuse for giving bad advice. This is her job, and she's been in the biz for like 5 years. If you want good advice, find another channel and stop supporting someone too stupid/careless to do 5 minutes of research in order to make sure her advice is good.
cool hair mish
Does anyone know what shirt she's wearing? It's so cute!!!
She seems upset in this video...
Hi Michelle. I miss you. If you're reading this, just know that my prayers are always with you and may you find happiness wherever you are in the world ❤
Guys bomber jackets are slaying these days, do you know some brand that is not so expensive and have this amazing stylish article?
so is no one going to talk about what the hell is she wearing on her hand
Michelle, can you PLEASE post some new makeup tutorial videos!? or anything like you used to post, I know you are busy and everything, but I miss those old videos, these types of videos are just kinda clichè
Does anybody know an app like Snug available for android?
Michelle where is the yellow dress you're wearing with the choker from?
Hi, may I know where the Baymax phone case is from? Thanks.
Anyone know what shirt she is wearing (the one that covers her fingers)?
arent dutch braids.......cornrows ??? sorry if im wrong dont mean to be offensive just wondering
And there is EBay to by and sell ur clothes and anything else
Love.
can you please start doing makeup tutorials again; I'm not saying I hate these vids I just miss mut
Lip Art is a huge beauty trend in my opinion, some amazing lip art Instagram pages are ryankellymua, zodieac and vladamua. It's just such a cool thing to see and it kind of makes you want to try it yourself!
Love Trend Report!!!!!!!
Where's Dom?
I used to make braids in my hair like two months ago, just the start of the year, and everyone looked at me weirdly. Of course I didn't care, but then I decided to cut my hair, and now that everyone is doing braids it's frustrating xD
Ok
How do u pee in a body suit ?
niceu
Humidity? In LA, ........nooooooo. Wait what
Wheres my goodluck? 😔
is there an app like snug that is free? :/
why does she looks like shes wearing kaneki ken clothes
... Backwards dutch braids.... No, those are cornrows
Great video.
What's the shirt she's wearing? Or cardigan?
Hi Michelle, I really don't mind when youtubers get sponsored to show certain products. All of the things you mentioned are great and I've no doubt that you personally like them, but lying about sponsorships is kinda weak. Again, there's nothing wrong with receiving money for mentioning products that you like, in the end, you have a lot of outreach and can help businesses get noticed (which is great), but please don't lie about it because it's pretty obvious.
Does anyone know where she got her sweater?
Be great if Dom could do a guys side of a Trend Report whilst you do a girls? So it's not just focused on female style trends :D <3
I don't know about you but my LG phone as a flash option for selfie that when you turn it on and it's dark, they put pinkish borders around the screen to light up your face 👌
... I didn't realize helios:femina came out on webtoon already nor was it going to be on webtoon. Is this Michelle's first webtoon?
Just when doing Dutch braids be careful not to do corn rows if you're not black..
How many times do you guys wash your hair in a week? Cause Michelle said that the product can last for one week and she doesn't wash her hair except for dry shampoo. Just find it kinda interesting cause I have to wash my hair like 4 times a week cause I feel like dry shampoo is not enough haha :)
U don't say good luck anymore, why?
love
02:54 IS THAT THE PLACE WHERE NIGAHIGA SHOT BROMANCE??!!!
can anyone tell me why she wears a half glove thing on one if her hands? was she burned? i just started watching her vidoes
does mich have a dyed hair care video?
New trend Report sooon?
WOuld it be possible to get a tutorial on the look at 3:52 though...... ♥3♥
Why the glove thing mish? 💜💜💜
miss u
I have become interested in ordering an ipsy bag from this video but I'm wondering if I can order older ipsy bags or if I just subscribe and get the next latest. I really liked the design of the February bag and last November's bag. Pretty much just wondering if I can get previous bag designs.
I used to be a beauty video addict but nowadays I don't watch any, like at all. This is literally the only content of yours that I watch (or any beauty vlogger!)
do u have any tips on how to get started on youtube doing makeup tutorials etc..
Not trying to be mean but the oil slick hair is kinda ugly :/ it looks like a Demi lovato Disney look and not in a good way
Nuuh I want the multi-colored hair - But my prom dress is blue so I would have to watch out and take colors that fit right? :'D And can I rock a choker to a floor-length, blue prom dress?? XD
02:47 I don't know that place, the only reason why I recognised it was bts did a photo shoot there xD
bring me back to the 90s when makeup wasnt clown looking and fashion was better
I don't like body suits because it's hard when ur wanna go to bathroom
Did she and dom break up? :/
KIM THAI!💚
Trend riports are definiatley getting better. I like that you show trends with real girls. <3 Now it's closer to me and more extraordinary.
What is the difference between a body suit and a leotard? Lol I'm a dancer and I have about a million and one leotards.
this whole video is just one huge advertisement/commercial
I'm ugly
Did she break up with Dom?
no
Black people have been doing braids for decades and now it's a "trend" started by White people, taking away all the credit from the Black people who've always been doing it? I would expect you to know better than that, Michelle. 🙄 disappointed
Did the girl really put some toner under her eyes...? Isn't unsafe ?
https://youtu.be/D4m9QgGqLH4?t=3
💕Anyone want to support each others channels?💕
I love Michelle's outfit. The thing that goes over her fingers and across her back...I wonder what it's called? With that and her hair, she looks like she's from the future. And I want to go there too!
Is that an iPhone 6 plus? It looks H U M O N G O U S in her hand.
Whats that thing that's covering her right ring finger and pinky?
How come she is loosing views and subscribers
is it alright to buy those asian meets western chokers if you're white or is it cultural appropriation?
had this question for a while..how do people pee in body suits???
u seem so busy that u don't make that many videos anymore :(
WE WANT MORE TREND REPORTS! WHO IS W/ ME?
your outfit is soooooooooooooooooo cute!!!!!!!!
Hey Michelle! You tagged a few of the wrong Instagram people in your description box! The first one is actually * randomactsofpastel * 
Second one is fine! 
The third one the link isn't working but the account is * blvckd0pe.clothing * 
The forth link is a different account. the one you showed is actually * tayst * 
And the last one is fine!! 
❤️😛🙂awesome video as always!!
Oil Slick, Braids, Bodysuit rocks! :-)

at 2:15 DOPE2111!!!I LOVE HERRRRR
Where are you from?
So whats up with that half glove?
Hello everyone ✋✋✋
I do love your trend report but braids have always been a huge trend for years. It's surprising how Kim Kardashian wears two dutch braids and it's the latest news while black women have been rocking that for years! I'm sorry to say that but it's true. I'm not against you at all Michelle as you are awesome for taking out your time to creating this report but this message is to everyone else who believes this is a new hairstyle.
I love trend report videos so muchhh
Hi, so i just wanted to say that Helios: Femina is so beautiful, every single part from the drawings to the language used. I look forward to it every Sunday. Congratulations to you for following your dreams and making them come true. ♡ love you mish ♡
Loved all the apps you mentioned, especially Snug, that's so helpful! 🙌🏻
what about box braids?
A majestic dark unicorn 🦄 couldn't have said it better 😅👌🏻 love you 💜
I just love how calming your voice is <3
And your hair is so incredibly beautiful! In 7 years probably one of my favourite hair colours I've seen on you :)
Your hair looks amazing!! I love it
love these trends❤️❤️
Oh Michelle, I'm so happy to see another Trend Report! I love these ^^ You did a great job! Very inspirational
I love the cool finger sweater thing, it'll will be the next big thing :)
Gosh I love the trend reports😍
loved this video!!
Michelle Phan is goals af
I love u Michelle !!!
Love this video
the body suit makes me look like a stuffed sausage and honestly I haven't seen anyone it looks good on unless they are stick think :P
Are the girls in your YouTube video your models??
Why hate her IF IT IS sponsored? Like, why won't you just let her make the videos that she want. Are you michellephan?
When is the next trend report??
does she have a black out tattoo?
I love the 'oil slick hair' look - subtle but colourful still.
Too much cultural appropriation for my eyes 😩
I think peel-off makeup is one of the best things to happen. It makes brows so much easier to do 😀
michelle that top is GORGEOUS! I love the half glove. Where did you get it if you don't mind me asking? xx
Hey Michelle I just wanted to say that you are fabulous , I love you and Great work  ♥
so basically the 90s are back.
Your videos are so peaceful <3
Michelle! I am so looking forward to read the next chapter of your comic book! I have to wait too long from now!!
I use the marc anthony shampoo and conditioner, and honestly it´s the best thing i´ve ever used for my hair. It makes it shiny, and it´s sulfate free so my hair is soooo not frizzy and sleek. LOVE IT
your fashion sense is literally goals!!
How do you edit your videos? Final Cut Pro? (I'm not so good at English.)
I love your hair so much
Kim thai!!!!
read eggnoid on webtoon!!!
whats up with the half handglove? love these videos tho xo
hey Michelle wanna be  best friends
hey mish i just wanna ask you, where can i read the helios femina? bcos i can't find it in my webtoon app
This is basically just a commercial
Why is this the only Video where She does have this hair color?
why her nose get red?
I love you so much you are so down to earth I can't believe I've been watching you for 4 years now 😂💞💞💯🙌🏼

Do you plan on going back to Vietnam anytime soon! I'd love to see more videos on Vietnam. Also the Webtoon was great I read all the chapters you had posted yesterday!
you are freaking gorgeous. you're my goal in life . i mean to be like you 😆
I love watching Michelle's videos they keep me in style and whenever she does these one on one vids I feel like shes talking to me, like we're besties.....I know that's sad but it brings me comfort
Oil slick hair looks soooooo gorgeous
Can you use all liquid lipstick as eyeliner?!?
Your hair is out of this world!!!!!!!! 💕💕💕💕
Can I be a potato with MSQRD?
Lmao.  Cornrows are now a new "trend". Jeez. Black girls have been rocking it since forever but of course that can't be appreciated, only a "new" instagram trend can be appreciated
her hair is sooo on point!!  😍😍 how do u take care of it???? 😭😭😭
I love it  🐰🐰😍
I hate your lipstick
it just kind of annoying to wear a bodysuit and then you have to go to the bathroom. you have to take off everything.
The second I saw the video I subscribed and liked.HELL YEA!!!
I was looking at the thumbnail and I was like WOAH WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHELLE WHAT DID I MISS....then I saw the video
loveee that you include all types of ethnic backgrounds in your videos!
I've been watching you for years and years, you have grown up to be an amazing woman. Love you! :) <3
Now the best thing was that TOTALLY AWESOME BAYMAX PHONECASE!
All your videos are awesome but I'm dying to see your makeup video again.
Michelle you're so amazing 😭💖🌙
Jeffree Stars liquid lip sticks are fantastic eyeliners!!
Your hair looks amazing!
i really wanted you to make a video!
and now you just upload!
I'm in heaven😇☺
never been this early!!! love this vid!!
its 1:55 in vallejo i am awake still why
I'm the luckiest person in the whole world. Michelle Phan (just happens to be my idol) replied to my comment. 😭😊💛👑
I love your videos Michelle! Been watching it for so many years now and now I'm addicted to makeup and fashion! Thank you :) 
OMG your hair Is so nice. I want your hair... Give me your hair. 😛
tnx mich.. you always inspire me to create my own style, never fear what others think, self confidence, strong woman, loving myself and be a hard worker. i hope you do a fashion or "what to wear in job, school, college, visit, meeting.. in a elegant style" or something!!
Thank you for keeping us all up to date on the latest trends. I feel like the braid and liquid lipstick as eye liner I will be using a lot. ✌🏼️🌸
i want to met u mish my biggest wish i hope one day god will make my wish come true
why is @feralcreature (a.k.a eugenie grey)not in the need to be followed???
COOL video
During college I did two internships instead of the recommended one, which not only gave me the edge over other applicants at my first job a few years later, but also I'm still friends with these companies and they are now clients of mine. Internships can be hard but soooo important!
i love how mish has branched out and has started to talk about things that schools don't, like tips on getting jobs (career talk), mental health/thoughts (pillow talk), and more! love you mish :))
Finaly a video that really learns you something💋
Michelle you're like the older sister I wish I had :')
I love these kind of videos I love that you're trying to help people achieve their goals
I had such a fun time filming this video! Thanks for everything Michelle!
WHO ELSE IS SOOOO JELOUS OF ALL THE NAIL POLISHES SHE HAS BEHIND HER??? 😍
I'm already loving episode 1!
Thank you for doing this video!! :)
I got to be an intern to a company I adore. But it turns into a nightmare. Some companies took interns as an option of a cheap labor. It's pretty sad. instead of learning about the working/business skills, I learn about life and how some rich people really are. XD
I'd love to intern for Michelle Phan!
This video was soooooooo good!!!
Loveeeee!!
Really needed this video in my life right now! Thank you
I love this! Your voice is so soothing! ❤️❤️
Cleaning up social profiles is a must in our age. Employers do check out social profiles before hiring, because it's easy.
This is so great for young adults and even teenagers who have a hard time getting internships!
I worked at Ministry of Health of my country for 3 weeks 😃 

Also a tip: add the languages u know.
This is great! I'm a freshman in highschool and I wanna apply for an internship in a couple years and this is very helpful knowing ahead of time.
omg I love this series !!!! Thank you so much for making videos like this💕
How to choose career?
this is such a great idea! i think it's also worth mentioning how to literally find internships, i.e. your college career site, via linkedin, via company's career pages on their sites, etc. because sometimes it can be hard just finding one to apply to! xx
This is an awesome start to this series, Michelle! These are really great tips from Lauren that I'm sure are super helpful to sooo many out there that don't learn these life skills in school. Great job.
This was soooo helpful! Thank you so much for starting this series :)
So helpful!  Thanks, Mish <3
Loving those pillows and the background (especially the 1UP and Hatsune Miku)!
This is so helpful because a year from now I'll be having my college degree. (fingers crossed)

Thanks Mish, love you ♡
I love this SO MUCH!!! I'm currently in college (UK education system) and still need to figure out my career, this is perfect!!! Xx
Thank you so much for this video ! It was really informative and helpful. I am going to graduate from university this year and I was not so much looking for or thinking about an internship but applying for a permanent job. However this has given me a newer outlook that it doesn't matter because we all start somewhere and that internships are a good place to start. So I appreciate this video a lot. Thank you Michelle and Intern Queen. 👍👏
Best series ever.  Seriously.  Thank you for making this!
This video was so helpful! (as i am a college freshman) Can you please do a video all about scholarships, how to find them, etc.?
This was so helpful! Thank you so much Michelle and Lauren! You saved us all! :)
I am currently in my last year of fashion business school and looking for an internship, this has helped me sooooo much!
This video has got to be one of the most helpful videos on youtube. Thank you for sharing this Michelle x
Definitely buying that book ASAP!
vigorously jotting and taking notes
I'm so glad that you make these kind of videos
Her video endings (end card)  always make me feel oddly nostalgic for some reason ahhaha
I adore your videos! They are so useful and just amazing! ❤
Thank you so much for this video. This well certainly help me in the future and I find it amazing that you found it important to share with others too. Much love :)
Thank you, this helped me so much! I am currently applying for an internship at a psychiatric clinic, wish me luck! Xx
What if you never had a job experience?
How to get an internship with ipsy, and em cosmetics? Who do I contact?
Definitely a unique segment of videos and who better than to do it than you! Love this idea! I can't wait to see the rest of this series!
This is really great advice, that I do try to follow :) Great video!
OMG...this really helped...Thanks mish
This was very helpful and interesting! Please make more of these type of videos!
Really good tips for interns and graduates. I had to learn all this the hard way and if you make effort it does work. The Facebook test is important. Employers will check your Facebook whether you like it or not.
This was super helpful; thank you for all the quality advice :D
I've heard that once upon a time people just applied for jobs and the whole process was not soooo complex. Nowadays you need to have a pretty impressive resume and experience and recommendations and what not, all for a basically mediocre job or .... internship. I can't help but think that this is wrong somehow.
this video is super helpful!!! Thank you so much, Michelle and Lauren Berger!
This is really helpful, Thank you Mish & the intern queen <3
I'm excited for career talk
I love this Michelle. I'm about to get into the adult world so this is very helpful luv u mish😙

NOTIFICATION SQUAD!!!!! ANYONE ELSE?
Love this... Thanks for sharing!
i love how michelle is taking a step further influencing her viewers to a good destination. 😊✨
I actually really liked this video! It's a great change from the typical makeup tutorials. Just wanted to say great job!
As a freshman in college, I do not have a lot of experience relevant to the jobs/internships I'm interested in other than my academics and coursework. Is it okay to include relevant coursework from high school (like AP courses and post AP courses)? If so, would you list that chronologically, or would you list below the relevant coursework from your current institution? I also had a three month long internship and research opportunity that gives me experience relevant to what I want to do today, but I did that internship my senior year of high school. Is it okay to list that under Relevant Experience? Also, shout out to those magnets! :3
You're not supposed to use family members as a reference guys :)
First Michelle Phan video I have watched in awhile. Love it!
WOW THIS IS SO HELPFUL THANK U. im not even a freshman yet but im really ambitious and really want to try out intern in sophomore year. i love career talk series :")
Notification squad goals👏👏👏
What perfect timing! Thank you
The real world is relentless, and it's ALL about who you know. If you are super intelligent in your field that helps too
Michelle, please do a makeup collection!!!!
Sweet lord baby Jesus ur so amazing.
Hi Michelle, I love your videos. I have a suggestion for you. Could you put subtitles in spanish for the latino community. thanks!
I wish I was Mish sometimes 😔
I love this series, such a good idea.
sooooooooooo excited for this series!!
yey!! I love your videos so much!!💜💜😘😘
that spelling error "cpabilities"
Is this weird that I was just told just today my next 6th semester in my Diploma in multimedia is actually internship. Im actually nervous yet i don't know where to start. And this notification popped up. It made me think God really wants to prepare me for a good internship. Thanks Mish and Lauren! This really helped me and got me inspired.
Loved this video!! I got some really helpful advice. Thank you so much! 😊
Hey Michelle, I'm loving these career related videos. Just having content on makeup and fashion as well as career on the same channel is amazing. You always inspire me! Keep slaying queen Mish ^_^
Thank you for sharing this video with us Michelle! One of the many helpful videos I've watched from you. This gives me more insight on internships as I'm working towards resume building and all that fun stuff in graphic design. Love you <3
I love this!! I may be young but I am very interested in the YouTube, beauty, and fashion world! I really want in!!
Thank you! This is good advise
Hey Michelle! 
The Video is awesome! 
I wanted to ask you what kind of programs your interns used to design their cv's and covering letters. 

Thank you! 
Hugs and kisses from Germany!!!
Thank you for posting this! As a college Junior, this is what I've been thinking about so much and I didn't really know how to approach it but after watching this, I will refer to this when I'm applying for internship! Love ya Michelle!
Love you michelle!💜🌙
Thank you ladies :) I was so nervous! But this makes me feel a lot more confident :)
I remember Lauren Berger coming to my college to give a little talk about internships, and couple years later after I graduated from college I landed a full time job right out of school because I had a lot of past experience from internships. It was a lot of hard work, but it really did pay off in the end! :)
This is such a helpful video! I'm so glad that this video was uploaded because I actually have an interview in 2 days!! :) thanks so much!
this video is really helpful! thanks michelle :) i found the part where you connect with your company via twitter really interesting!!

however there is one thing i digress because in singapore, we are not allowed to have family members to write our letters of recommendation. family members tend to side you, and sometimes their judgement may be partial. so in jobs, we are not really allowed to have anyone related to do a letter for us.

just sharing how it works here! :)
It would be so great if you had closed captions. It would be fantastic for the deaf community to understand and learn from your advice about careers.
To fill up my resume before I got a job, I volunteered for a ton of stuff. Even stuff that wasn't related to my field of study. You can tailor your experiences to the job/ internship you're applying for so if you helped at a soup kitchen or something and you're applying for retail, you can say you acquired customer service skills from it. A mistake I made was just putting my position title and not elaborating on what I actually did while in that position. I eventually fixed it and it definitely paid off in the end.
Omg mish !!! Thank you for this! 
I really needed the advice! 
This video is GOLD!
Sooo looking forward to more episodes :D
thankyou for sharing the video, it's really helpful 😍
I love your work Michelle! You're my inspiration! Kisses from Brazil 😘💖
Hi Michelle.

Thank you for sharing this video with us. I have always looked up to you. You are such an amazing person. Your enthusiasm for life and how you perceive it just inspires me.
THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATIVE AND AESTHETICALLY PLEASING MAGNIFICENCE 💝
thank you for this video! Just subscribed to internqueen!!
can you review 'pony effect' makeup items???????💕💕💕 LOVE U MICHELLE
Misshh, this video is very helpful and inspiringg <3 Thank youU!
Wow, this is such a crazy coincidence. I uploaded a video called about career advice with Casey Neistat (following your passion after college) just now, and I check my subscription box that you posted a video on career too, Michelle! I have a CRAZY story of how I met Casey Neistat and asked him "what advice would he give to people who just graduated college and want to follow their passion". This was a few weeks ago in NYC, where he filmed a video with me, which is the one I just posted! I am also trying to inspire others as you are. I'd love to work together and continue inspiring the world. <3
Love this, thank you so much for making this series it helps a lot :)

"Be a nice person" 😩
too late i already have alot of person who hate me😩
Hey Michelle, I have a suggestion for the next Career talk : "Open your own business"
I wanna open my own business (but not on the internet) inspired from a shop I saw in Japan that I though was a great Idea and we don't have anything like this in my country.

I would like some information, talk, anything related to open up a business. I am currently finishing my HS studies so I still have about a year maximum to go before going into business class.

thanks, and love you!
"Make sure you're a nice person" haha
This was such a great video. I hope someday I can intern to ipsy.

Loved this! Very helpful and informative!
YES THANK YOU MICHELLE
YES THANK YOU MICHELLE
I think it's ridiculous that students should be expected to update their social media. These days, I hate social media; I hate what it's become. I don't really use it anymore, at least not for myself. On twitter, for example, I follow some interesting organizations/people that I like, but I no longer post. I don't like how this may hurt my chances at finding an internship. I may just delete my social media presence all together...
I recently made a video talking about my experience with internships! Love Michelle's inspiring words!!
Thank you Michelle! This video really helped me.
Just do makeup already .!

SHe said she would do more makeup videos on her Forbes video and I'm still waiting...
Lately it's just talk talk talk.
Loved this!! I've almost finished my degree in college and I'll start looking for a job/internship very soon and this was very useful!! Thank you Michelle ❤️

je suis française et je t'adore, je te trouve trop belle !!! j'adore tes vidéos, j'espère que tu vas continuer encore longtemps sur youtube et que tout tes projets se réaliseront. Voilà bisous
I liked the video, but it kept distracting me on how much nail polish she has, but yet she isn't wearing any. Anyone else?
wooow this is really helpful to everyone looking for a job. not only for beauty related careers, but (mostly?) any job in general. good job, michelle! 😙😙
Michelle, 
Thank you so much for making this video! It is so helpful. Especially because I am a college freshman who's looking for internship. This video had great tips and advice. Thanks! 
xoxo
Anmol <3
Really helpful!!! Thank you!
My high school requires us to do a job shadow for the last three weeks of our senior year. So while I've had no work experience I'm excited because this is actually a great opportunity for resume building. I'm shadowing at a product development company and I am super excited :)
This was really helpful. Thanx Michelle
Thank you so much Michelle and Lauren !!! You guys do me a big favor !!!
I work on a college campus and I use student employees to help support my department.  If I am hiring a freshman with little to no work experience I do look at their extra curricular  activities, because that tells me a lot about that individual.

Do a makeup collection please!!
This video was soooo informative <3 Thanks for sharing all of these tips. 
Also, anyone else pause for a sec when she said Oklahoma? No? Just this Okie? Okay. xD
This is going to be so helpful. Thank you Mich!
Okay this was perfect. I'm currently a junior in college looking for an internship and this video could not have been more helpful! Definitely ordering that book today!!
Super excited for this career series! I can't wait to learn from someone so successful
who else noticed the backround music ;)
Thank you Michelle! I am going to enter into the internship world soon and this video was really helpful and inspiring! :D
Michelle THANK YOU SO MUCH! this video was beyond helpful. Soon to be college graduate and looking for internships, this is priceless advice. Already cleaned up my resume ;) much love!
that was helpful but can you please do more makeup skin care videos I've been waiting all week long
I loved this so much!!! Thank you :)
i saw that one of your interns  in the videos had her photo in her resume, but i read that that's a bad move because that makes you more prone to being discriminated against because of your looks or race. is that something to look out for?
such a unique series for a blogger like you and actually really helpful, not vauge, loved this so much xx
This was really helpful! Thank you :)
Wow 😘 learnt lots of new tips I can use when I'm older
That resume looks so good
Thank you for making this video, it's very useful to me!
Not a highschool student but this was very educational =) definitely using some tips from this video.
Thank you 👌🏾😉😊
Hey Michelle, for a future career talk, could you talk about creating a good resume and cover letter?
I would love to be YOUR intern 💜
This is amazing as ive been sending out emails to get internships within the fashion industry!
I started watching your videos due to your amazing makeup skills. But your pillow talk videos and now this advice video have been extremely helpful. You are beauty, brains, and everything inbetween. Thank you.
this was so informative! does any body have any suggestions about where to find internships for high school students?
THIS IS AMAZING
This was absolutely helpful!!!!
I am desperately want a overseas job. seriously no kidding. I want to work. USA or UK please call me for interview. 😭
Mish your helios comic is so beautiful. The illustrations do NOT go unnoticed 😍
This video is so helpful. I'm only 14 yrs old but I really wanna make something of myself even though I'm really young and no internship would probably pick me. Thank you, Michelle! 😇
Really helpful! I love your diversifying the channel. I'm looking forward to watching the next episodes of Career Talk. Good job, Michelle! :)
amazing video,❤❤
This was really helpful even though I'm just a freshman in high school I know I'll be looking for an internship senior year and in college so it's really nice to have little background information! Love you mish💜
so helpful! thanks michelle :)
This was extremely helpful! Tysm.
This is so helpfuuul ❤️
hatsu miku in the back :-) 3D concert coming up in SF YAY!!
Can you do a video on hair growth?
Cnt wait for the acne series to come out!!!Anticipating for it so much rn!!!!!
Thanks for this :)
Could you please do an episode on jobs for teenagers and maybe volunteering/internships? I would really find it helpful since I'm going to stark working in highschool next year. Also, this series is so unique! Thank you for everything :)
omg thank you next this video helped me a lot
can you do more make-up videos?
Loved this!
i got my first full time job 4.5 years ago in HK exactly because I did a nice follow up note after the interview while the other candidate didn't do it. My boss hired that girl as well 4 months later and told her this incident. Ever since then, I remind myself as well as all my sisters and friends the importance of follow up, you never know! PS. I did an intern job when I was in university and I stayed in the industry for years now, I think internship is such an valuable experience. For the lucky ones (like me), we find what we like. For the others, at least you may find what you don't like. That really helps when you graduate and have to decide what to do for a living. Time is money (even though you are young) and the less time you spend on "trying to figure out what I want to do", the earlier you get to your (short-term) goal. Cheers :)
I enjoyed watching this video. This is very informative! I have done an internship before and I am currently looking for an entry-level job so these tips are so useful! I look forward watching the next episodes of this in the future especially more about entering entry-level jobs/interviews etc. Thank you so much! More power!
I've always heard about this channel but never checked it out until it came in my recommendations. This video was so good! Thank you for sharing, I will definitely be implementing some of these points.
Getting an internship at 14 was my best decision.
Michelle! i read your comic on Webtoon and i love it!! i want to see next episode! xox
LOVE THIS !!!
I love these tips. As a sophomore in college, this was so helpful. (:
MICHELLE DID U READ MY MINFD?? Lol I've bern actually looking for info about this since last week! 😹
Thank you for it ^_^
So interesting and useful, even when I'm just a freshman in college <3 ily

This is so helpful <3
Can you have a makeup collection? :)
You guys are both so pretty! love the advice
This woman is amazing! Great tips, very informative.
hey Michelle could you do something for jobs too? 
despite having the work experience and all the credible skills people don't hire and it gets very disappointing and discouraging. you must be having experience on both the sides of the table so please do some video for that too. :)
Love this , this is a must for everyone !
this video stressed tf out of me
I'm still love all you're video's eh girll :)
OMG this video was extremely helpful. I'm a junior in high school and most of my friends are seniors, so internships are a big thing. Now I know that I will be prepared when the time comes. I know this series will be a very big help. Thanks again Mich!~
This was great!!! Thank you!
Thank you thank you thank you! 💜
Great series, Michelle! Looking forward to the later episodes in this series :)
OMG i will graduate soon and i think this video is much more insightful rather than the one my uni told. thanks for the advices. i think these tips are not only good for getting an internship but also for getting a job. THANK YOU so much. I love you, Michelle. You really put great contents in your channel. xoxoxo
This was a high recommended video. Nice talks and thx for making me learn new things.
I'm gonna  love this series!
I love this video, I learned so much!!!!
I LOVE ALL THE NAIL POLISH COLORS
Great series
I wish Michelle Phan would do more short stories like before. I loved those!!! But this is really educational too of course.
This is so helpful!
This is so helpful!
I really needed this video because I'm trying to find an internship in the Fashion Industry!
I wish i watched such video back 10 yrs ago :) thanks for doing it Michelle
This video will really help me a lot so thank you so much! 😘☺
I love the great advice I wish they bought up how to prepare for a phone interview..
Thank you so much Michelle for this video! My college goal is getting an internship at L'Oreal in NYC. I am graduating from high school this year, and next year I will be going to college in North Jersey, just so I can be close to the city! This video and the tips you and Lauren shared has helped me so much and has given me greater confidence on being able to get that internship! I can't wait to watch more of these Career Talk videos! Much love to both of you 💗💗💗
I love this video ! it helps so much.
OMG Michelle ThankYou so much!!! I was really not expecting this type of videos. If I loved them now Im seriously obsessed with the channel! :D
Is it only okay to put extra curriculars if it's relevant to the job?
Well that person's advice on resume can be risky. I think it will work the best if youre applying for an internship or a job that actually sees your creativity over professionalism. Overall, the tips for resume is too cliche.
Hi Michelle and Lauren! Thank you so much for this awesome new series Career Talk. Last year I landed my first full-time job and all of the advice you listed is great for landing internships, part-time and full-time jobs. The thank you note is always a must and i'm glad that you mentioned it. All of my internships have helped me in someway at m current job (and i've done a lot of internships!) Thank you again for the new career series. I can't wait to watch more!
EARLY CLUB
What if you don't use social media?
I'm a social media junkie and a blogger. Someone to hire me in Japan? XDD
New Video♡♡♡♡Love u^♡^
Thank you so much for this video Michelle I'm going to have an interview today to be a social media/marketing intern and these tips help me so much!
I like this video a lot! Very useful as a current college student. Thanks Michelle!
Does Ipsy have internships? I'm pretty close to San Mateo so it would be great if they did
the video is all about what i need to know  .. good job mish <3 ....... like if you agree with me
I love that you are making videos like this. It makes you become so much more than a beauty guru.
So informative!
great video❤️❤️
I'm watching this and i'm still in middle school 😂 but this is really helpful :))
when are you gonna make  another make up vidwo
Iloveyou michelle 😍💕😘😻
Thanks for these tip, I am currently applying for internship. I am finding difficult
Omg just when I was thinking I wanted to work for ipsy! Wait for me Mish, will just finish my degree and pass my board exam!
with that resume I'm always worried everything will be moved around the page when its opened
love this <3 love it love it love it
I'm a junior in high school and currently have an internship at an elementary school as part of one of my classes and it's been a great opportunity!
The quality is pretty bad
I think these are awesome videos helping people getting ahead
I love your voice.
Did you guys even notice her last name? (Dan and Phil ship name?!)
Coincidentally I went to a career fair right before I had an interview and it helped me so much! I wasn't nervous at all, I had all the practice I needed with selling myself and knowing what exactly is on my resume and how to explain everything.
Hey Michelle! where is your update on webtoon?  :|
love this video i really learned something today and it was interesting this really helped  me to get into dept with it.
this is soooooo helpful omfg
Even though I finished my internship last year I most say I really injoyed watching this video. I am trying to find a job but it been hard these days bc of school. But on a positive note hehe these are great tips 👍👍
a thank you note!! Why didn't I think of that
This wouldn't refer to interning with an animal hospital 😂 I don't know why I watched but it is very good info if I wanted to intern in vogue. That would be the life. ❤️
This is REALLY a great idea!
I love your outro
Hey michelle I have a fun video idea for you, how bout a tutorial on a neon rainbow smoky eye? :)
im seeking for an intership in cosmetic because i like it but it is so hard. I have learned chemistry and innovation in france for 7 years. Sadly, It is not easy for me to come in a french company because they always ask for a specified master of formulation or maketing. (or i have only a licence degree of chemistry and master of innovation. it is not enough:/ i know but it was my choice. i can't poursuit another prestige formation either university because it requires a lot of money:(. i just wish to be able to work and earn money to not be a charge anymore for my parents in vietnam😟) I wish i have an internship at ipsy but like u can see, my english is limited. :( i really need an internship  to be graduated. My deadline is fin april 😭
This is an excellent resource and refresher for students of all ages! Thanks Michelle and Lauren for putting this together! Looking forward to more of this career-related series!
Perhaps in future episodes you can touch on networking and how to make connections with the right people to help advance your career goals? xx
Michelle's spine must be made of steel or wood because her posture is always perfect.
Really like these series, thank you Michelle !
Where can I get an internship for fashion design which would pay for housing
Awesome timing! Im looking for an internship at the moment :D
thank you Mish, I love you <3
Nice information! Loving it!
Love my IT internship.  I hope for engineering soon.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I LOVE YOU
really hoping to see ur mkeup tutorial or beauty tips :'(
Something is different on Michelle's face..maybebInjiat missed you haha
You look so grown girlllll love your hair
I was wondering if she is still dating Dominique
Can you do a pamper routine?
The second girl who asked a question really looked like Shailene Woodley.
Thanks!!
Very informational, keep these coming!
im so early
I miss ur beauty videos😌
ILYSM mishhhh
Is an internship the same as work experience ??
3:51 CPABILITIES. Anyone else saw it?
Why don't you post as much as you used too 😢
I <3 You
omg, who ever noticed that Michelle don't upload beauty related video lately? 😩😩 so sad, maybe she will no longer upload any makeup or any beauty related videos, Michelle please reply !!! ILY!!
this was SOOOOOOO HELPFUL
Very helpful tips!
where's the guy tang amazing creation? :o
thank you Michelle for this video! I need to do an internship on September to January and now I'm in the process of applying. This video is so useless.
the queen of intern is awesome! very clear, informative and didn't bore me at all.
Yaass! i love "Career Talk" keep it going Michelle.<3 i should really get that book.
i always love Michelle
doesn't chronological mean you start with the thing that happend first? as in listing the things how they happened in time?  that's a bit confusing
Love you michelle u are awesome
Hi michelle😍
This video is very inspiring !
15th comment
Greatest video ever michelle! im actually applying for some internships atm and I am not getting any reply ?? im so frustrated !
This was so helpful, can't wait until you post the next episode.
that was very educative I loved it!
Do u have to be in a college with a specific major to go into an internship??
These tips are very valid! Another tip if you don't have experience, is share your passion. If you are interviewing with someone and they see how passionate you are about the company or position, no amount of experience can beat that. Passion drives success! Also, start internships early :) It gives you a head start of what kind of company or work lifestyle suits you. The internships you choose to do in college especially that are similar to your dream job will definitely help! 😘  😘
OMG THANKYOU SO MUCH What a coincidence, I have a job interview in 2 weeks and I was nervous about it..  thanksyou so much your vedios really help to improve confidence. 
I have nervous when I have to answer so just wanted some tips and tricks 
how to answer interviewer's questions? @Michellephan #Michellephan 
love u 💓💓
i really enjoyed and learned a lot from this segment!! will stay tuned for more of this!
Hello my love ♡ Can you do a grunge 1980's total look video ? See you ♡ 
Very helpful. Thank you Michelle and Intern Queen.
that ending reminds me of kuroshitsuji... am I weird😂
Is that a sayo samonji plush in the back?
I have watched your videos since I was 14 years old... Your tutorials have helped me avoid the awkward makeup stages of my teen years. But now that I am a college student....I couldn't have found a more helpful video.
Really helpful!
do you know of any places that would be willing to offer internships to freshman in high school?
Very useful video . Thanks a lot !!! I love it so much <3
GREAT TIPS ❤️❤️❤️
OMGGGGG 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS!!!! As a freshly turned 22 years old i'm struggling and it's always great to listen to talks about career, it helps and it inspires me! so thanks a million!
Honestly I'm not too sure what I want to do with my life and I have 0 experience but right now I want to try the communication field! I'll try to look for an internship... maybe it's my life vocation who knows lol
Totally loved the video. Please keep the serie, you really help my so much in so many diferent ways! Can you give advice like this but for people who doesn't live in USA? (In my case, I'm from Venezuela) Love you Mish!
Love!!!
That is so true...I was lucky to intern at my local broadcast station as a bilingual producer :). I wish she can make a episode on how to find that dream job after your internship.
thank you so muchhh
great series/video. Makeup and fashion are great and fun, but I love this empowering women to advance their minds and professional careers.
Good segment :)
I'm into digital marketing I haven't joint course officially but I would love to have your input on it what should I do to make digital marketing my carer
These were very good advice 👌👌 thank you 😊
Please keep posting videos like this one. It's really useful for everyone, it's amazing that we can learn new things while entertaining. Great Mish <3 So proud of you !
I like her voice :3
Just in time :-)
Wow. I really learn a lot from this video. I am soon-to-be an intern, and all these tips are very useful to me. Thank you Michelle.
Is Dom still with her?
Thank You Mish! I really find these helpful. I'm  14 years old that you've helped and inspired since 2012. Lots of love from the philippines!
did anybody realize that there was no 'Good Luck' at the end? :(
is it ok to give a thann you later a week after the interview?
Thank you! This video is so helpful, I'm graduating from university this year and I know how hard it is to get into the fashion industry!
You could think Michelle is pregnant... :D
What program names would be best to make a resume?
How do you find out the contact info of the HR person?
Around the 4:00 minute mark, what software is the intern using to build her resume? Does anyone know?
Hi Mish a few questions if you will? I'm an under Grad at my local community college and am majoring in Graphics Design and Visual Communication. I know all of your internships are in L.A. My question is, are you will to help relocate an intern to your city or are they required to be local? And. Are your internships paid? 
Thanks for putting this video up it was a great help and relief !!
How old are you ? ❤️
99 liker fun video♡
Thank you!
Michelle, im really fat but i have an addicton to food i seriusly can't exercise 
What should i do ?

                                               Love dahpne
Did anyone else catch the typo at 3:51 🤔
I'm a biomedical engineering student and had done two internships. My advice is to attend those career fairs that your university or college organizes. I got my internships by just attending those, submitting resumes and doing quick talks with the company reps. Also, extra curricular activities really help a lot. Many companies have high regards for experiences that makes use of your leadership and social skills.
I LOVE YOU MICHELLE!!!
i love you mish💎💕💕💕💕💕💕
this entire topic is sooo beyond me. im 33. finished HS w/a ged & never attended college. the info in this video is more tailored for college students. I wish an internship for a company was attainable. I really don't wanna be 40 & still a stripper.  sigh.
Damn Michelle! back at it again with dem nail polish!
i like how you actually got someone who is a pro on this topic to sit down with you and give your audience great tips and advice on how to properly get themselves together. continue to rock it as usual your biggest fan ever stay truw and stay you
This was so inspiring.
LOVE THIS SERIES!! WOMAN POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the example of that girl's resume wasn't so good. The layout was cool but you're NEVER supposed to put a picture of yourself on a resume.
Can you do the subtitle for the video??? I really want to understand it clearly. My english and listening skills is still poor
earlyyyy
more makeup videos please...
i love you so much my love😍💕😘
I am really loving these kinda videos from Michelle. They are something different from makeup, Fashion but very useful and also helping people in different ways. So yeah 100% 👍🏻
can u do a how to make a wedsite???
Been desperately searching for internships #junioryear
Very nice , informative video michelle.. Looking forward for the next one..
My number one tip would be take internships seriously. When I studied I noticed so many people think internships were annoying and they took it very lightly. They ended up at shitty places, not gaining any experience. A good internship is a 95% chance at a good job, in my opinion.

The professional email address is also a must in my book. And if you're doing anything creative that requires a portfolio, get your own domain!! Stay clear of wix or freewebs or whatever. And get an email address with the same domain. You can get this for about 10 bucks a year, there is really no excuse.
Thank you, Lauren Berger for all of you amazing tips and advice. And thank you Mishelle for Maori g this video. I am very serious about my future. And it is totally true that it all starts with the internship. I will take all these tips into the future, and I will definitely be checking out the book.
YAAAAAAAS
I love u too michelle :*****
It is a great video, thx a lot. However, it would probably be much better if you could make a video focusing on the first job application, things like what to prepare for interviews, and what to put in resume and stuff like that
This was so helpful! I thought I knew a great deal about resumes and cover letters etc. but I still learned so many new tips that I will be making use of. Definitely the thank you notes and the 2 week follow was something I haven't done yet. Thank you for starting this series because it is so relevant and so relatable for everyone. Thankful 😘
Really helpful:)
how to write a resume?
Michelle i miss when you make actual makeup tutorials so can you still do them
early
PLEASE POST MORE ILYSM
Loved the advice!
Wow never been this early😱
Where's That planner from? Anyone know?xo
I'm currently interning at a Silicon Valley company, but GIRLS don't be afraid to negotiate your starting wage. This is something a lot of girls don't do and I wish more would do! Pro tip: never say the number first, until the recruiter mentions a range.
I  needed this since I'm looking for jobs and internships.
I just got my internship! Thank you so much this was amazingly helpful! Especially reminding us to bring resume copies. ♥ Thanks, Em!
yo im here and im early
Hi, this video is so helpful! I'm wondering which software was used to edit the resume in the video? Such a standout resume!
ILYSM
who else read Michelle's comic at Webtoons titled Helios: Femina?
I've recently applied for grad school and this was very helpful. I feel a lot more confident in my application. Endless love for you Mish!!!💜
this video is very nice thanks😘😘
Wooooooow , thank you Michelle
I've heard a lot of people debate about having a picture of yourself on your resume vs. not having it. I don't know which is best.
What program/website did you use for the resume with the yellow pop of color? I love it!
write you would do the dirty.  work for free.
whats an internship
where is the CEO part! ps mish I'm so glad to see this kind of content here, it has morphed and evolved nicely since you first started :)
is there interships for film studies?
Definitely wanna watch more career talk video!
OH MY FRIKIN GOSH!!!! MICHELLE!! I'm not really a big fan of you but now I AM!!!!!OMG!! YOU ARE A CREATOR IN WEBTOONS LINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMFG I AM OBSESSED RIGHT NOW OMG I CANT!!! PLEASE!! REPLY!! ALSO!!! Can you post a video that talks about your webtoon job? AHH OMG THANKS!!
CLOSED CAPTION!? Please be considerate for all those  who are deaf/hard of hearing people & those who speak languages other than  English
Have a beautiful days<333
The girl spells "Capabilities" wrong on her resume at 3:50.
Can you make a video on how to start a career in the beauty/ fashion industry
Hi Michelle. This is really helpful. However most of the job descriptions of hiring companies are geared towards accounting and PR positions. How would one go about finding an internship in the cosmetic chemist direction? Let's say actually formulating and testing out formulas with a chemist of the company? There's no "apply here" for those positions even on the company website to submit applications. I'm assuming being a undergrad doesn't help much either but I'm working as a chemist intern this summer. I would like to branch out next year. Thanks!
helloooo its me
Ayeeeeee Oklahoma shoutout haha the forgotten state
Please take a look at my makeup channel!😊 thanks
great tips but the thank you note is kinda wierd lol
this really help...^^...
Every high school senior needs to watch this!
아이러브유
Great video, so helpful
Hi. I have a question about writing my resume. My school had a lecture once about writing a perfect resume. But she said that if I am applying for a logistic/Marketing department, I should not write that I worked in Starbucks or other restaurants. Is this true?
This is so useful though.
Hi Mish, I admire you <3 
I am Vietnamese and on OPT (Optional Practical Training) year for international student that allows us to work legally in the U.S. Since you first begin your life in the U.S as an immigrant and then success in your own career, have you ever hired international student to your team? Or you would not want to hire international student? If so, why? 

International student nowadays really want to get a chance to work in U.S professional environment, in order to perform their abilities, but most of the employers will put out attitude toward the international students, so make it harder and put pressure to us as an international student. Do you have any advice for us? Or Could you do something that may support us like speak up to the public so employer will aware and look at us differently. Because as a part in the diversity nation, I feel like they left us out and hardly give us a chance to prove ourselves. 

Thanks Mish, hope you can read this since you have a lot of comments and things to do. 
I love you <3
Is there any way I could get in connect with you?
Makeup pls
oh goshh.. i am currently looking for an internship. thank god  you made this video. it really helps boosting up my confidence as well as learning new things which are crucial for the internship application. thanks!
Thank you so much!! I graduate in 47 days and I totally needed to see this video.. Added on my list to watch later
ILY
I don't think I liked the format of this video. It was just so much information being thrown at you in just a few seconds. But the video was so informative! What about the people who aren't so school involved? What about the people who aren't so preppy and school spirited. It seems like all those people get left behind in an interview. Not all people like being so involved. It wasn't my cup of tea in high school. All I wanted to do was graduate as fast as possible. Is there a way around this when your applying for a job.
I thought I was going to be bored with this video but I actully learned a lot even though I already finished my internship. This could also be helpful for fresh graduates. Thumbs up Michele!
I applied for an internship at my local hospital, and I really hope I get it! This video gives me hope that I can do it! :)
make another career talk video!
How do you send a thank you note? Is it alright to send it via email? :)
I haven't been on your channel in so long, so I was surprised to see this video posted, but this was actually soo helpful. I'm a freshman in college and I have been stressing about this so much, especially with an older sister who has already figured this stuff out. Thank you for this video!!
I was fifth
I miss the old mish, that made amazing makeup tutorials. please mish balance the topics of your videos
So proud of Lauren! She's a fellow UCF alumna and I got to personally see one of her speeches! She's definitely the queen! Did she mention she had something like 17 internships while in college? She's awesome!
This video was very helpful Michelle, but I kind of miss your old video style, I wish you would do more makeup videos, it seems lately you are doing more pillow talk videos. Anyways, I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove you and keep on doing what you love
At 3:51 that girls misspelled capabilities on her resumé. Always check for typos on your resumés!!!
nice vid 😀
a no-makeup makeup look !!!!!!! plz Michelle!!!!!
love u💞
Interesting to hear about the importance of a thank you note. Is that something specific to the american work-hunting culture? Im from Europe and I have never, ever heard anyone talk about sending a a thank you note (especially if it was after a first interview).
I stopped after "recommendations from family members" ....are you serious?
very inspiring as usual, Mish! I miss ur makeup turorial anyway. make it for ur old fans, rite? hehe
WAIT MICHELLE! Did you actually start a webtoon? o
Is it appropriate to have a picture on your resume like the example? I wouldn't think so, but please give me your opinions :) it's something I'd like to start doing if so
lovelots ms michelle phan
This video is very informative!! Thank you!
I was just wondering, however, in the video when you showed a glimpse of the sample resume, was there a specific website for that layout or a guidance on how to achieve that or a creative layout?
I'm 21 and I've never had a job before and I really need one now but I keep getting rejected. I've had several interviews but they keep rejecting me and I dont know why because I didnt do anything wrong...I'm still in college so I dont know whether that makes a difference but ???
I love you
When the experience you have is irrelevant, is better to not include it. At least from my personal experience.
These were some really great tips!
things you need to learn in school because this is real life
in the process of creating my first resume
Im waiting till your doing a beauty video...
Please do diy room ideas ,beauty hack, cooking and baking videos . I miss those videos so much Michelle 😀why don't u do that  kind of videos anymore ?
Great video Michelle!
This is such a coincidence since I'm applying for loads of internships at the moment! I am so scared now about my resume being too boring.
I received 3 internship offers at retail corporate headquarters this summer! The advice is spot on.
The sad moment when you can't actually find a internship you want in your area... -_-
Yayayayyayayaya early
The current school system tells us exactly what to do, going so far as to put us down if we do something in a different way that when it comes to jobs and internships and shit I feel absolutely clueless because I have no one dictating my actions anymore.
Thank you so much I really need this!! But can I ask for tips on doing a portfolio? Im planning to apply for a creative position and I'd like some tips if you dont mind :)
eaaarly
This is SO great!!
Just what I needed. The job market is depressing currently so  I feel like this series keeps me going.
I JUST had a phone interview for my dream internship today, wish me luck!
early
okay. hi, i want to ask. if maybe. Michelle can invent a palet daily life for different undertone skin. i am new in Make up and i think that would really help. mine is medium neutral and with make up it is so difficult
I feel a lil stupid but what is an internship 😅
Michelle I love your dress! where did you get it?
love you
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS SERIES MICHELLE! I don't know if you read comments anymore or if someone reports the comments to you, but whoever handles these please:
PLEASE KEEP UP WITH THIS SERIES! AND PLEASE MAKE A "WHAT TO DO DURING/AFTER YOUR INTERNSHIP VIDEO" I am watching and and LOVING this omfg.
What did she mean by a Follow Up?
:) Enjoyed it
As a former Corporate HR Assistant I could say this video gives tips for anyone really that is out there interviewing. Great tips ladies!
Yay
There was a lot of good advice. When I'm on maternity leave I am gonna look for a new job and will take with me some of this.
Michelle , do you have a comic at webtoon?
Hey @MichellePhan! What if we want to intern for IPSY in Santa Monica but live in NJ? Would love to move to LA for the summer to intern for your company!
Her channel is all over the place.
michelle is so inspirational!
Do a video with dom ☺☺☺☺☺😀😀😀😀😀
Surprised to see a photo in the resume. Not sure if it's required in the US, but if it's not then don't put your photo.
Thank you so much for this amazing video. ...finally I've found the right YouTube er
woopp woopp
This is such a helpful video! I can speak for my self, going to University in a big city like Toronto, it can be really hard to set yourself apart. I am very interested in reading that book and really get my film career started! Thank you so much!
Is the tune from an anime? If so anyone know what it is? I've dying to know because it brings me back soo much from childhood :') 11:39
Hi Michelle, I'm new to the channel and I just wanted to say that you seem like a very nice person, you are very pretty, a perfect role model and I'm Vietnamese just like you! You are my idol, I wish I could grow up like you! If you reply, that will mean the world to me! 😄
One thing I encountered last year when applying to internships was the problem of pay.  Companies wanted to offer me college credit instead of money, but my college doesn't count credit for internships.  I understand it's a legality thing, but I feel like I lost a couple of really amazing opportunities because I couldn't take an unpaid position.
I want to ask this that has been troubling me lately:For the longest time now I have been wanting to make a YouTube channel soooo much  (beauty related ) .However it  has also been my dream since I was a child to get involved in politics one day,  in order to help my country that suffers from not only an economical crisis but also incapable and the worst: indifferent  politicians. So I am afraid that if I choose to make a channel it could later on pose a problem to the realization of my dream: '( . What do you guys think?
thank you so much Michelle you read my mind! it's just about that time to apply for internships but I've been putting it off because I was just so nervous but after watching this video I decided to stop waiting and start searching!
Hi
Hi
what is an internship?
Love you
Where has Dom been
Is Mish still with Dom?
Did you creat a webtoon?
Guess who I am😊
Still can't believe she is half-Vietnamese-Autralian
What is an internship?
3:52 CAPABILITIES IS SPELLED WRONG
86.
Wow, awesome video :D
How about when you come from another country, say Germany, and you want to apply for an internship in say London. My letter of recommendations would be in German, so I would need to let everything I have be translated, or what is the rule in what to translate and what not?
Please
WAIT--did I just see Sayo plushie doll there beside the Grumpy Cat doll?
usefulllll
Was this filmed two different times? 👀 the different outfits
Hi Michelle! Thanks for your useful video. In next video I hope you help me to give some tips to get a job if I dont have any experience? And how I should write to have an impressive résume? Thanks!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i don't like the part of any company or somebody from work checking my social accounts ! that's a private thing even if i'm not putting crazy posts !!!
Thank you for this, it is so useful! I would really like a video with tips and tricks on how to get a job abroad. For example I am from the Netherlands and I would like to get a job in California but it is really hard to start this job hunting thing. I graduate this summer and after that I will be on the job hunt, so tips are very welcome haha! I am looking forward to the rest of the episodes in this series :)
Excellent video!
Why is the setting in a dressing room ? The link ?
This video was pretty useful, thank you for posting something that is very useful for life. Rather than other 'gurus' posting diys etc that they get on things like pinterest. Not everyone wants a youtube 'career'
Ways
Did her and Dom break up?
I like the idea here, but in terms of an actually useful video all of these tips are very basic and not very helpful. I would love to see more depth or interesting tips. For anyone in a college setting these should be common sense.
Ich verstehe dich zwar nicht aber du bist trotzdem cool :)
Who wants to be YouTube friends haha?
Color on resume?
So where can I find her makeup tutorials???
sooooo do you like still do makeup tutorials or are you done with that? cause right now I feel like most videos I see are weird videos that a lot of people don't care about. I miss how you post makeup tutorials every week. still love you though. but i really want more makeup tutorials.
Does anyone know what application the girl used to make the resume that they showed?
Michelle seems like such a great role model!! I want her to do more videos like this
Great video
is it possible you could do a Wendy Marvell cosplay video I know you might not do makeup videos as much but around this time is animezment and I would like to cosplay but I can't get a good video can you please help me Michelle phan
yr indian fan 😊😊😊
Meh.
Hello
Great video!!
my soo good
The hair colour that guy tang did at her isn't anymore. I really liked it tbh. But you are still michelle
What are your thoughts on sending a thank you email vs leaving a physical note? Would the physical copy be more effective? 
Any smaller YouTubers want to support each other!? I just uploaded my neutral, everyday look :)
ok, i m 12 why am i watching this?like why?
Hey Michelle, would you ever do an buzzfeed video please?
Simply nailogical
¿Soy la unica que extraña los videos en español? llorando.
What do I even put in a resume if I haven't done any extracurricular activities, have no work experience, have no volunteer experience, and haven't joined any programs/clubs? I'm almost done with high school and I'm not even involved in anything. I'm also shy too and I feel like no one is going to hire me. It seems hard to get a job. :( I want to get a part-time job so I can buy things that I want with money that I worked for rather than relying on gift money from my parents and relatives.
Cool
Hey guys, 
I am a long time viewer as I'm sure many of you are. I don't normally make posts like this, but that's because I've never been in a situation like this before. My nephew was born two months ago with heart calcification as well as many of his vital organs, such as his kidneys, not working properly. We've held on as long as possible and remained so hopeful, but the doctors have said there is nothing else we can do. He is being sustained by life support. We plan to baptize him tomorrow and say our goodbyes. My oldest niece has created a GoFundMe page to help out her mom with giving him a proper burial and to alleviate some of the medical expenses. Please help, even a $1 goes a long way. Anything is appreciated! Sharing the page also helps. Thank you so much. 💕  😘 Sorry in advance if I inconvenience anyone with this post. I just feel helpless. Thank you for those that have already donated and reached out to me! You don't know how much it means <3
Am i the only person who's feel weird when michellephan trying to look like karen? I don't like how she wearing that big jacket on. I miss the old michellephan 😢
do a whats on my iPhone video!!! xoxo
Babe
hi
hi
4the
People have been makeup-shaming me recently, and I hate it, Mish! I need a video addressing makeup shaming. This issue is very serious and it you are a great voice to advocate it.
Great Video! xx
hello, i am new on your channel and this video is so right for me at this moment. i am a law student in my final years of college and i have a hard time to get an internship, because i dont have experience in the area but just a music teacher. This video helps me a lot so thank you so much :)  i hope now i can get a job :)
Is there anyone else that just really really misses her makeup tutorials? I mean that was her claim to fame and I wish we'd see that instead of these advice videos. They're cute, but nothing compared to a good mish makeup video. I miss those.
great tips and video!
Where is her oil slick hair?
Nice
can someone like tell what's the difference between an internship n like a job? like it sounds more professional but like does it really matter? help?!
Why are your videos not as interesting as your old videos?
Sorry but I am a sixteen year old girl living in Mexico, can someone explain to me what an internship is?
Can someone tell me Michelle phans fan mail adress
These make me feel sad now because I think of the depression michelle was feeling
Great video!
Who else wants to see her now ?😥😥😥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Do any small youtubers want to support each other?:)
Hi Michelle ,  could you do a video on how to dress for an interview or for jobs. I have a baby face and I find it hard to transition to wearing business wear or business causal without feeling weird out. Japan has a strict dresscode for 'jobfinding' and I don't really want to wear the same suit as everyone. I want something that shows my personality from my attire.
I really want to meet u mish u r like my role model, n I am jst 13 n I used to watch yr videos when i was jst 10 n I am soo interested in make up, I want to share my ideas with u
Please come back 😫
im sorry but is that aoba on her shelf?????
I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos when looking at the likes and views they get. She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube and she is getting people to be in her vids in place of her. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots
Where was your bomber jacket from?
what is the site address for the cv profile layout thats shown in this video? (the one that the girl uses)
I am an Indian and I have only 45 days to complete my hobbies and after that I have to choose ca as my career choice I have no other option than this but yes I have been allowed to involve my dreams my hobbies between the course of CA but I know that it is so difficult course that I have to so much involve myself into it that I have to forget all my hobbies and dreams 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😯
wwwwwwwwoooowwww
Plz make just like a fun video that isn't like a q & a video maybe like a DIY video or just room decor
umm.. a study showed that getting no pay as an intern means you will get paid less than a paid intern at a "real" job and the paid intern will likely get the job over you...  and, btw, some unpaid intern jobs actually violate the FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) law.. just google to read articles about that..
Any advice for applying for an internship after college? I got my bachelor's last year and I'm taking a year or two to get relevant work experience to see what I want to focus on in grad school. A lot of internship applications I see are only for people in college, so is it still okay to apply if you're a year out? Is it okay to make your case for consideration despite already having a diploma?
I have been internship for IT position for 3 years. Since I was a sophomore in high school. Now I am a sophomore in college. I starts to love marketing a lot. However, when I applies fro Marketing position, i get rejection a lot because I dont have any Marketing experiences. On the other hands, many employers on LinkedIn try to hook me up with IT position which I know that I dont want to do anymore. What should I do?
im so stressed nowadays but dont even know why..i feel like crying over the little things and i cant seem to relax and not feel like theres smth i need to do, smth i need to be in a hurry for...advice?
This video was so helpful and it’s what most people don’t think they need but they do! Thanks!
Hello Michelle, I am an extremely huge fan of yours!!! My name is kearra and I come from a small Caribbean island named Trinidad !!! I will love to meet you in person one day because you seem like such an amazingly nice girl !!! Oh and I just wanted you to know that your YouTube channel was the first YouTube channel that I ever subscribed to. I love you !!!!!!!!!!
Fb is gross
good
Michelle is the best friend I always wanted IRL
Michelle is so calm, i love her so much lol
Incredible advice as always, Michelle! I agree, internships are a great way to get your feet wet without the commitment. By the way, loving the big hair in this video!
Michelle is an extremely hardworking and successful business woman. I would really love to see a morning routine/night routine just to see how shes able to motivate herself and keep organized for her day.
all I can think about right now is pillowtalk by Zayn
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Can we talk about Michelles hair in this video ?? loveeee
LOVE THIS! Hope to meet you one day!!! ❤️🙌🏽😭
Hey all! I'm a dreamer just like Michelle and many of you. I am also a creator. Recently, I took a trip to New York and am coming out with a series of foodie adventures videos (Cronut, ice cream rolls) and a video on how I envisioned myself meeting Casey Neistat (and it actually happened -  we filmed an advice vid on following your passion after college!). If you're into inspiration, food, and travel, I think you'd love to video content I create! With love, Iris.
I love you Mish <3
You need to do a guided meditation video! I listen to your videos when I have trouble sleeping. Your voice is like silk. Seriously read me a bedtime story!
Michelle is so pretty and I love the quote with being a great mind x
you are such a great person. i want to know what your next goals are, if you don't mind. just curious.
Loving these Pillow Talks, Michelle. You're so respectful and intelligent! Thank you for sharing your knowledge 💕
Mish you're looking gorgeous, and PILLOWTALK should be your theme song lol
Ly <3
can we get a updated on how your new makeup line is going? maybe on Snapchat or Instagram?
So if we stop the neighbours,
And a place you lose your fears,
A place you lose your tears
pillow talk, my enemies my ally. prisoners, then we're free
Hi! I just wanted to say that I applaud you so much for your channel. You really have stepped away from the makeup/beauty category and made it your own. I love the genuineness, art and depth of your videos. Keep doing what you're doing and more power to you! <3
I think the best way to limit gossiping around you is to show people your complete and utter disinterest in the subject. If you yourself gossip, you need to get a life. No really, you need to find something to focus on that isn't other people's business. However, if you don't gossip and the people around you do, just show them they bore you when they're gossiping. After a while, they'll do less of it, since it's no fun to talk if no one's doing it with you.
Of course, humans are social beings and talking about others will always be a thing, but it shouldn't have a negative impact on you.
When you are a person with a physical disability like myself, and i want to work in the beauty business (i'm aiming for Ulta or Sephora) how can i go about getting it when you fear being shunned for being physically limited? Even though said places claim they dont discriminate im still worried that my disability will be a setback to them.
I don't wanna sound shallow, I adore corporate Michelle and her life tips but i also want to know how she did her hair like that. Mish is life goals!
My fave series here 😊
Michelle, I just want to take a moment and write this to you, whether you read it or not is totally okay with me! I just want to put it out into the universe for all to hear!

You have got to be one of the most relatable and inspirational people here on YouTube. You remind me so much of the quote "Work Hard, and Stay Humble". Although I may not understand fully how hard you work, I know that you do work very hard and long hours. I deeply admire people who are hard workers, especially when I know that they are working hard so that their loved ones can have a good life. This is the main inspiration I have taken from you. For example, you work really hard so that you're mom may have an easier and more relaxing life. It made me realize that although its important to be self-sustainable, I also realized the humility one must possess in order to work that hard for others. I feel that you have this gift of humility, Michelle. As do all the people in the world who labour for their loved ones. And thank you Michelle for working tirelessly to make all of your ideas become a reality for us. I wish you best of luck on your journey.

Love,
Annie
I missed Michelle so much....she posts videos less these days..Mish plz make more videos...we miss you.
I love pillow talks, but I miss the makeup tutorials
i think of you as an elder sister i always wanted to have
can u do a pillowtalk about breaking friendships?
I love how you encourage girls to learn to program. I studied computer science and it's so much more fun then people think. There is a lot of creativity involved in programming.
So is that a set or her real bedroom?
that glove thhhooooo <3
LOL I thought Michelle was actually in her room! 😂😂😂 Can you pls make a room tour video?!  💖😍
Your pillow talks are so "real". You give the best advice !!!! Have a great day, and God bless you!!!! :-)
Does Dom really want to sleep in a bed like that??
You are gorgeous! I want to see more videos of you each week. I'm sure your busy but omg I miss you:(
I recognize that glove, she was probably drawing on a drawing board 😊
OMGOMGOMG
DO A TUTORIAL FOR UR HAIIRRRRR
Hi, Mish! How do you network? It makes me very nervous! Thank you!, ILY! 💜
Idk if you do DIY tutorials or not, but can you do a DIY wanderlust room decorations
I bet Zayn lowkey watches these videos.
Fabulousness!!🙌💕
Omg!! I love your glove where'd you get it from? ^-^b
Can you do a how to meditate video? thanks xx :)
Notification squad? ayee🙋🙋🙋
ahh mish's hair in this <3
Can you  do a how to meditate video?? btw loooove your hair.
I just got my first real job today so this will for sure be helpful ! 💓
I would love one of these to have a how to help anxiety or stress sort of theme, that would surely help so many people! Either way, I love these videos mish, thank you so much for all that you do <3 ^_^
Mich where did you get the dreamer lightup sign it’s stunning ^-^ <3
Would be amazing if you share your meditation/breathing techniques Michelle! Humanity is waking up more and more... and I'm noticing more people tuning in internally and not externally (wanting to meditate, Energy healing, finding the power within, etc) and taking a few minutes out of ones day to meditate correctly will help one adapt to the rising consciousness! -Namaste Love you!
Thumbs up if you love Michelle's pillow talks!
You look so stunning mish! xxx
These pillow talk videos are my favourite! Your voice is relaxing! 💕
What's amazing about you is that you remain humble until now even if you had achieve greatness in life......A typical ______.
she always chooses the best time to post these videos. each time I make a "drastic" decision she posts a video related to what I did. thanks so much for your advice Michelle :)
She's so hot. Amazing personality.
Michelle, you have an incredible mind! your videos are fun to watch and definitely are helpful too. I hope you make more videos in the future, if not that perfectly ok, you are amazing at everything you do! Take care xoxo

Beautiful Video Michelle! I really love the pillow talk and it always helps me out, thank you so much ❤️
Hi Mish! 💕 :3

I've been hoping to see a video from you giving advice for those in need of finding confidence and peace after having gone through abuse. It's difficult trying to keep my own worth in mind and that I should never give up; it's also scary having to move forward when you don't know what else awaits you in the future and feeling like you always need to be on guard. How can one feel more relaxed and confident with themselves, others, and what awaits them in the future?
Pillow talk seems more distant with the studio look
How can I believe more in myself? I really need advice
I agree with everything you said about internships! It's so important to start internships early in your college years instead of waiting till the last year of college because you really find out what kind of work atmosphere and certain roles really mean. Once you find out what kind of company you want to work for, you can customize your college projects/thesis that will catch the company's attention. 💕 I have a beauty channel as well so please check it out if you are interested 😊✨
@MichellePhan I LOVE this kind of video. It's so helpful. Thank you for sharing :) xoxo Vanessa
That is incredible, Michelle. THANK YOU ♥
What a beautiful soul you are, Michelle  ❤️
YAYY NAMASTAYYYY
Pillow Talks are my favorite videos!
OMG LOVE YA ADVICE TOTALLY AGREE <3
Your hair looks amazing 😍
Love you Mish💋
Michell I love your products they are amazing
The best way to stop gossiping is to read Quraan
I'm your biggest fan❤️✨. When you going to Tour?😛😇
I love u so much! You're so smart and well spoken and beautiful inside and out! Love all your advice! I wish I knew you. :)
Can you do a tutorial on your hair? It looks amazing!! 

Btw I loveeeee this video! #powerwomen 💪🏻
I make 10 sec vids pushing random objects...
And pushing a puppy
Literally.
quote is by Eleanor Roosevelt. ILY Michelle and thank you.
Omg I love your hair in this video 😍 pls do a tutorial 🙆
I Love your advice it helps me so much 💕❤️
I swear these videos always come at the most opportune moments in my life. I needed this michelle! Thank You <3

i was like "oh man it's done already???" When u said "that's it" i love your voice and your advices. <3333
omg why are you so pretty both inside and out omg <3
Is that a smudge guard on you hand?
I agree and also in my situation. Jobs aren't necessarily always going to keep you. Lay offs are real. So I guess being prepared for those unexpected situations. Also I feel like a certificate is under rated. Hha and pharmacy rep are careers people don't realize can just as stable as Nursing and etc. 
My situation I rather get a certificate or promote my self in whatever job that hires me.
Also adapting to whatever work environment your in.
Pillow talks always give me the best advice that i actually use c:
Can you do a Q&A video?
I love your success story and how you are as a person. So inspiring!! 
Any beauty youtubers here that wanna support each other? ❤️
I always get so excited when I see you posted a new video 😍❤
how does ur videos always look so majestic?? 😍😍😍
I've been waiting for a video😍!!! So happy you uploaded. 😘
love this video so much...u have helped me so much in having more confidence
Thanks Michelle! You are so right! I can agree with you learn the most when you fail. I learned in college. Love you!
I believe also green tea has a caffeine. if you are sensitive for caffeine, try Houji-cha(roasted green tea, no caffeine!) FYI :)
you have such a beautiful soul... love you
you are so beautiful and give great advice 👍
I wish if ipsy had international shipping😓
Your so cool keep up the good work and God bless ya soul :D !
Sometimes I feel like I don't have the best leadership skill, I definitely am a great troop! People can count on me :) In syaa Allah
Please do more business tip and motivation for women! 🙇 I would love to hear your business story! @Michelle Phan thank you! 😙💖 #bestrong
i love how this is so open minded 💫 ✨
Your hair is so beautiful, Mish! Can you do a tutorial? 🙈
you're so inspirational ❤ love you
Where did you get that led dreamer light? I want something similar in my room. 💕
Thanks for the advice! I had trouble with drama and stuff, and now I know how to handle it!☺️😊
Love this series. Thanks girl
I love how these videos feel like I'm sitting infront of Michelle as she shares her knowledge 💗💗
Hi Michelle Phan how do u deal with people who judge your ability and underestimate you ?😔😔😔
Great minds discuss ideas
Average minds discuss events and small minds discuss other people. ❤️ That is my favourite quote ever and I try living by it :-)
Michelle ur the best one love u amazing video 👏👏👏❤️❤️🌹
Love that you mentioned Vietnamese women are in power here a lot! That is literally how both sides of my family run, women, being married or unmarried, being a mom or not a mom, they somehow manage to take care of everything perfectly including caring for family, working for family, supporting for family, and rocking their field, be it in education, laws, IT, cargo shipping, international relations, etc. 
Now only me is still not at that spot of success like them yet :(
so true..
Don't be a small minded person.
Love this series and you! ❤️❤️
LAST TIME I CAME THIS EARLY I WAS STILL A VIRGIN

Hi Michelle, do you have any advice for starting up a freelance illustration business? I've worked with one local company recently, but I'm really struggling to get my work seen and noticed. I have a website, and a professional portfolio.

My main focus is watercolour illustrations of wildlife, as I think awareness of the environment and state of biodiversity is so important. 

However, I know there are so many illustrators out there who are also doing the same thing I do, and who have more experience working with clients and professional people. 

I hope you can help in your next Pillow Talk. Thank you for listening 😊
Great advice be blessed!!!
I love your pillow talks..and i love u ❤️❤️
Hey Michelle I love your vid. You should do a video on meditation!

Lysm!! Gossip in my school generally is big! I do my best to avoid it, and when my friends gossip, I doubt they're friends at all!
Hi Michelle! I love your videos and how soothing your voice is. I think I speak on behalf of myself and other viewers that we would absolutely adore if you could post a guided meditation/sanctuary video. I love meditating more when there is a soothing voice guiding it! Thank you,
Love Nicky♥
These videos always make me feel so inspired!
Your thoughts are so insightful, & honestly some of the best advice I've heard from anyone when it comes to this type of stuff. <3
Your hair looks amazing!
This is such an important topic. And not so easy to find advice online on, especially with easy terms and directly to the point. Thank you, Michelle!

Also, quite sad that wasn't your real bedroom. 😂 Lots of love from Romania!

you're the best! 😊💪

A seriously good vid, Michelle. :) You give perspective too (young) people. I sometimes miss the simplicity of your "old" videos, but the videos that you bring out nowadays are such high quality that it doesn't even matter if I'm interested in the content. I'm just proud of what you achieved.

anyone else thought of zayn's pillow talk wen u read de title. :)
Muy bueno, Michelle!  Love the channel!
Gossip can limit productivity. HR  people like to fire employees who start intrigues and are gossiping at work, because it's cheaper to fire on person, than to build a new team.
I love having advices by someone who is so mature and smart!!!! Love you Michelle😘😘😘
Can u so more tutorials
woah it looks like you have only three fingers on your right hand😂
"Climb on board.."
That hair is big and MAJOR!

plzzz launch ur EM products in India also..
Come on board, we'll go slow and high tempo. Light and dark, hold me hard and mellow...........( continue )
Hi Michelle :)

I turned 16 just recently. Here's the thing, I've never had fine lines or anything like that up until my mid-15. I'm really worried as I'm just 16 and the lines on my forehead are starting to look more potent (not sure if I'm using the right word, but you get my point 😅) what do I do? You're a beautiful lady and your skin is so flawless but I'm already starting to develop wrinkles at 16 :(

I don't wear makeup that much, the most I've gone for is eyeliner and brown lipstick but nothing actually goes on my face (eg: foundation, primer). My skincare routine is simple, just rinse and moisturize (every other/3rd day I put a night pack). Can you please suggest me some ways to get rid of these lines? (Sorry if I have any grammatical errors, English isn't my first language).

Thank you 🤓🙌🏼
You are always so positive and happy ahhh :) you jusg always spread good vibes!
lol at least we know that michelle came up with pillow talk first ;))
It is always easy to talk, to listen, you gather information but... It is always so hard to put things in practice & do it.
I love you sooooooooo much Mish.😍💜
wow !!so inspiring !!! love her soooo much
Your hair looks fantastic in this video!
Early omg
Thank u for women Vietnam building business

I recently read a book called, So Good They Can't Ignore You. It made me want to change the past and how I did college. I would recommend that to anyone having trouble picking what to do as a career. It's a very good read!

Right now, I am having trouble getting a sustainable job while being disabled. It's rough. :/
💝

VNese pleaseee !

I honestly love pillow talk so much bc Mish is so chill and her room is pretty awesome
I really like the idea of how you have all the questons on paper vs just reading them off your phone makes it more in touch I guess especially for this kind of video haha
Great video!! Thank you, Michelle!! 💜

I love your hair style
You didn't say 'good luck' on this video.
Her voicee 😍😍
@michelle phan Does your company offer any internships for college students?
iloveyoooooouuuuuuuuu.
10th view MUAHAHAHA
Michelle, I normally don't add comments to any videos, but listening to you always made me tempted to ask something so intense in the public. So big props to you! <3
How do I survive high school without have the mental trap of thinking you're messed up or useless. One part of me is dying to act normal and the happy self..However, there's another part of me that's purposely trying to bring everything down all the time. How can I get that one negative part  of me to go away and to be positive in sudden cruel times?
- Thousand loves from Roslyn :3
I love you Michelle! <3 <3 Please share more videos. ^_^
I love you <3
You how learn how to value things more when you fail and have to work harder than when you are succeed.

Hey Michelle,I love you videos a lot!!!! I love doing eye make up but my eyes are super sensitive,whenever I do eye make my eyes get red.My eyes get red,I will get headache kind of side effects even with eyeliners (without eye shadows).

I love u sooooo much so inspirational💙💚💛💜💎
I think Zayn Malik watches your videos, Mish... I mean, his new song is called Pillowtalk & you came out with this series before he released his solo! 😂😂😂 I love you, Michelle! You're such an awesome human being! Keep doing you, boo! 😘💖
Awesome Michelle  ❤😊
Make a comic video about the comic your doing x

Hey Michelle, I'm loving that two fingered glove! Where did you get it? P.S love your videos, keep up the great work!

How can you stop overthinking
I love that quote about different minds. It's a good reminder.

I love the way u speak Vietnamese with Hue accent!
Em thích chị nói tiếng Việt bằng giọng Huế! 👍
she seems grounded
My colleagues bully me, even when I brought pillow for my chair they making a big deal about it, after that when I draw on my lunch time they talk about it too.. I cried. Don't know what to do. Why they making a big deal everything I do.. Help?
today is my birthday <3
hi michelle! can you share with us some basics about mediation and how to get into it? love you!
you are an inspiration.
well put :)
Can you talk about how to deal with stress
I like you but I never understood people with their shoes on the bed :o :o :o
Heyy Michelle! Just wanna say thank-you for some of the things you said in this video :). "Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew my heartbeat is here"
So true!
Can you be my sister 😢
Great topic and discussion to help people with their careers and in business. Being able to adapt can help you get through the toughest challenges =)
Hi Michelle , how to be a different person than the others?
I'm Japanese
I am so distracted by the facts that she's wearing shoes in a bed...
This video was such good timing! I've been feeling really bad about myself due to not having enough enough funds to go to school for an degree in art. But after watching this video, I feel like I can do anything if I put my mind to it! Thank you so much Michelle! :) You give such great advice! Keep up the amazing work!
YOUR GLOVE OMG NEEd
Cool??
it bothers me that she has shoes on
Love your pillow talks! I could listen to you all day long... Hope you can make them more often! And wouldn't imagine you have so much people behind the scene!! I thought you were in your room talking to us with a single camara :O 
Michelle is an extremely talented woman.That is the reason makes me love her....Tự hào là người Việt Nam
Please can you make more makeup tutorials.
I Love it so much 🦄❤️
I loves all of your video <3 <3 <3
OH I thought that was your real bedroom haha
I have a special event tomorrow and I was wondering how Michelle got her FABULOUS HAIR! I love the pillow talk videos and while I was watching I literally saw her hair and was like WOW... I NEED TO WEAR THAT!
I love her because she dose not wear a crazy amount of makeup like most of the gurus
Hi! Does anyone know a tutorial on this hair style?
Mish is sweet always liked her
Michelle has good taste in music. I ended up falling asleep watching this video because of that song in the background. I don't know the name of it, but it's very relaxing and her voice is soo soothing 😍
Just watched the GuyTang video. Can't wait to see your new hair in a video soon
Hi! I am From VietNam and i am learning English, if u are a native speaker, i hope u can help me to improve my english by talking English with me^^ (on skype) thank u and sorry for my poor English. Have a nice day^^

Thank you for all your advices. My parent also immigrated to USA and I had to learn everything on my own and also help my family in the process since they don't speak English that well. I always felt stuck and not able to pursue my dreams because I feel the need to help my family first. Thank you for your pillow talk and letting me be able to feel more confidence to open my mind up and pursue my dreams ❤️

I think that lingerie and period tampons etc should be designed by women only :D just saying, it is not the most important thing, but an easy everyday life would help get through hard situations too
That's true about Vietnam.
Subtitulado please
the music is disturbing me.. i am dancing instead of listening

Omg Michelle😳 where did u get you're dreamer LED wall deco ? 😻😻😻🦄Or whatever It's called 😅
I use to gossip about my friends....Its True. Ok....
Michelle ever since i've watched you back from when I was 15 I've always looked up to you. I've always wanted to have a career like yours and have a life like yours. I just feel like it's impossible for that to ever happen to me and I feel so discouraged from even trying.  When I watch your videos though it inspires me and makes me want to try harder. Hopefully one day I can meet you and I can follow the footsteps that you followed to get where you are. Love you and Love your vids.
My boss started a company.  But he knew he was not particularly business savvy (He is an engineer).   So he hired a CEO, to run the business side of things.  Out company does about $10 million in sales every year, and even though he is not CEO, he still retains a significant ownership of the company.
Yes I want to be something a robot won't take over...- I really want to be a App/Web/Software/AI programmer that's what my passion and heart is at. Robot is a program and can't write program so I am safe.
You talk a bit like Kim K
Is Michelle and Dom still together?
chị nhận dạy kèm tiếng Anh cho em đc không?
You look tired
How could some drama person could steal your BFF away from me
I like that glove thing Mish is wearing on her right hand! I wonder where she got it from. 😄
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. Eleanor Roosevelt
Am I the only one who thought Michelle was in her room by herself lol Its kinda cool to see the BTS
You're wearing shoes on the bed! Aren't you worried about it getting dirty ? :,(
MAKE UP TUTORIAL Mish pleaaaaase.
I love her hair in this video!!!
My friend told me something called Pillow Talk came out and I was like 'No Michelle already made it!' and she was like 'No its Zayn's 1st song' Well duh dumb me
She didn't say good luck omg Michelle what have you done
ZAYN af lmao
Michelle can you please do a Q& an A with Dom or can you do a eat it or wear it challenge with DOM or ROSANNA PANSINO
Am i the only one who open the comment section and commented "first" or "second"
Why do you know so much about life
Zayn Malik anyone😂
Who cares if your first
But shoes on the bed mich...;0
Are you and Promise Phan related?
Is she still dating Dom?
oversized sunglasses and lipstick are key to look less tired lol. it's my go to since I'm exhausted from working on my startup and my anxiety
I love these
Is it just me.. Or does anyone else miss the OLD videos from michelle?
Hey Mish! I just had a little request. Instead of making these videos ( although I love them ) please post more makeup or DIYs! I die each day waiting for your makeup video . I don't mean to offend you  btw! 😘😘😬😁
Can you do a make up look using your em cosmetics?
It's cool you bring up women in the workplace and business, and how much we have grown in that subject. But it's a little overwhelming to think about the wo/men who wear hijab ( I mean islamaphobia is a big thing, currently ) , and women with disabilities, and women of color, etc. personally intresting, and can't wait to prove people wrong when I'm older, being a hijabi. really inspiring to see people like you, Michelle, accomplish so much. Much love x
Woah that black glove thing is actually kinda cool??
Great video, you inspire me so much. You make me believe that anything was possible
I'm really digging this instrumental where can I find it?
what is the song at the end
why are her views dropping? has she become irrelevant? I'm seriously asking.
Where can i get that neon sign?
Zayn you stole the title from Michelle !
You theif
( anyone who watched zayn Malik's music video knows what I mean)
im really really sorry for asking this but where is dom?
Michelle do you listen music
third
Thx
Does anyone know the Name of the song in the intro? I`ve been looking for it everywhere..
As a fellow Southeast Asian, seeing you wearing your shoes on the bed will give me nightmares for the next 50 years.
Hi I really need to talk to someone 
Sorry if it miss spell or wrong grammar 

I have been study overseas for a while 
I went to study  overseas since I was p4(age10-11)
Then I drop 2 years 
Now like my friends are all s2
And I still p6
Ppl are making fun of me

Ppl saying that am stupid so I drop 2 years
I'm all alone in other country 
My parents are not here
Am all alone no friends 
Now I need to study really hard to get 4 years of sec school (in my country sec school is 6 years)

Sorry for wasting ur time 
Just ignore me
LOVE!
What is the song she always uses in these videos? It's so pretty DX
Michelle is officially the best life coach ever and her advice is free 😍😍😍
She looks exhausted
I love you Mishhh
She seems like a good friend. I need a friend.
Michelle deserves the success she got over the years
Is here any female CEO's that can give me advice on how to be one too? I'm liking the fact that CEO's deal with a lot of leadership and they also provide everything for their company. Something like movie directors. I am almost 18 and I am really curious if this is the right job for me. I'm always the one with the strong vision, I know how to make people believe in my ideas but I am scared of failure, and scared if my future projects fail in my future company. I know it's a day to day job but I really need some advice on this topic. 

Also: my grades are not the best, so I don't know if being a CEO requires a lot of education or is it just a business that requires leadership with a strong idea. 

help
love it so much
12th
so wise
What's the music she always plays right at the end of her videos called???
Hi
oh hey female zayn malik
Hi Mish
what happened to her hand?
In the bed all day bed all day bed all day
Michell Phan, do you writing blog?
I just got fired from my first job at kohls bc I used a kohls cash that I didn't earn. Idk how to tell my mom that the coupon she gave me led me to probably not being able to work in retail anymore.
is it weird i find her voice soothing?
Buy pillow talk on iTunes
How do you submit?
Best business books I recommend to other women are by Mika Brzewski- "Know Your Value" and "Grow Your Value." Helped me get more than $10k in salary growth! Michelle, I loved YOUR book and you sharing your story about sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor is just truly inspiring. As an American with an Asian mom who learned English as a second language me, I understand how you developed and am so proud of your journey and success. Thank you for continuing to inspire us all!!
What is on her hand?

I was very confused for a second, thinking she only had three fingers on one hand, and then I realized she has two of her fingers covered. XD

Wow her advice and quote about how to stop gossip is absolutely amazing and so well said. I hope people all over the world listen to this advice and spread it onto others
💗💗💗💗
My friend Iris was steal away from my friend her was Iris Taylor
I still remember watching your diy videos like an egg facial or tomato sugar scrub that you filmed on your webcam at your home in Florida, and now you've made it this far! You're seriously my favorite YouTuber because you're just so genuine and creative, and even after reaching all this success you still upload videos for us
So wise Michelle.
I relate to that, I'm the friend that brings everyone back from causing drama and a lot of people come to me for advice but sometimes it gets a bit much :(
Hello Michelle Phan. I am Xuan, from Viet Nam. I really love your chanel. It's so great. can you please make a subtitle in english for your video because there are a lot of people like me arent  really good at english. thank you so much
I hope the next pillow talk she talks about mental health it's importance and mental illness.
Does anybody know where she purchased her "dreamer" sign? I really like it!
je vais te baiser puis te manger puis te rebaiser
how do I make that to my hair??
aren't you like 30 why does your room look like that
where is ur boyfrnd
1000 club!
I feel like Michelle's whole look here will be more complete with a nose ring. All throughout the video I was imagining her with one that at the end I was blinking because I thought she was wearing one. Lol
Are you pregnant ?
great video x
😨😱😧 what happened to your hand?
also one of my good friends birthday just passed and all my friends keep asking me if I am going to her party and i wasn't invited I mean what should I do we have been really good friends since second grade I thought we were really good friends need your help so much Mish she even invited some of her not so good friends and of course my chrush started to like her after I found out he likes me 😩
I love your videos so much, specially the pillow talks are my favourite, you give such great advice and you're always so calm, it makes me calm as well. You're goals Michelle. And because we're starting our YT channel we aim to be like you, all we want is to entertain people and give them a happy place at least for 5 minutes or so.
ZAYN am

zayn stole your title michelle
Ur bed looks so comfy, then theres mine.....
you're a good role model
she really has a calm personality, and her webcomic was colorful yet so soothing and enjoyable at the same time like her videos, i love everything she does, i don't know how someone as amazing as her can even exist.
hi !
She would be the best mother if she decided to have kids omg
I'm in a bit of a pickle with my current work situation. I'm a student, and I've been working at the same retail store for about a year and a half now. I work with a great group of people for the most part, and I've been there long enough that I've gotten a raise and I'm no longer working for minimum wage. However, I have a hard time getting along with my manager, and the scheduling at the store is really, really awful.  it's hard to find work elsewhere that won't start me off at minimum again, but I'm honestly miserable where I'm at now. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like if I keep working there one of these days I'm just gonna snap and walk out.
Shoes on the bed😖
zayn named his song after your series
Where do we send out questions? Sorry, I am basically lost lol. If you accept questions here, One I have been meaning to ask is how do you deal with being consistent especially in the kind of line of work? I love graphic designing, but sometimes life pulls me away in creating what I love. It's a struggle for me to be consistent in what I want to do.
Michelle, what is this thing on your hand? :) I've never seen that before.
is it true that if you really really truly believe it it will happen? i have a hard time believing things will eventually turn into place
The thing is,is that women are more powerful than men if you actually think about it because women were and still are the ones that make most of the clothing and they atarted some of the amazing things we have today .
That is true you do learn more from the failures than the successes at least for me i do.
Were is dominique !!!! I miss ur past videos ;((
Awesome advice! I started my own candle business last year, and I am having so much fun working! I never thought I would say that... Like you I didn't go to business school. You will be surprised at how much info you can find on the web. I started on Etsy, and now I'm on Amazon, I've done dropshipping and wholesale. I need more Michelle business advice!
nice room
I see sadness i your eyes in this video... I hope wherever you are now, you are finding happiness.
You are really an inspiration Michelle! I wanna be like yours! <3 :-)
Mish, u r the sister to every girl, teacher to every one, and someone that everyone wished they had in their life.. :)
Mish, u r the sister to every girl, teacher to every one, and someone that everyone wished they had in their life.. :)
How can you stop a relationship with your bestfriend if you just realize that your bestfriend was just using you as slave?
where did she get her dreamer sign? ????
What do you do if your work wants you to cover someone else's blunder while they give your job to the guy who did the mistake in the first place? Ha my real life work experience is ill inducing.
so the dreamer light isn't actually in your room? it's a set? ;) (I think i knew that, just to actually see it feels like I can't pretend it's your real room anymore)
I love Michelle
where is dom
Also remember that there are smaller local version of all kinds of industries. I work in photography on the side and I work with all kinds of wonderful people, photographers, artists, and models that would not have had a chance in the traditional industry. But I feel that the work we do is just as valuable, and beautiful.
awesome channel!
I am a huge fan and hope to be a youtuber one day
😙💃💓
You are such an inspiration Michelle! Honestly you are the only youtuber that hasn't changed, and that hasn't gone bad :) Your voice is very calming and I love your videos! Even tough I don't read manga I still can't wait for yours to come out and I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy it. I love you so much Mish and thank you for being an inspiration. :)
Michelle im 24 suffer from depression and anxiety, my family and home is 'dark' and negative always have been, i cant work due to depression, i dont have any goals i dont know what i want in my life im sick of doctors, i now live with a bully (sisters husband) which he makes my life at home and ive been so uncomfortable for the past 2 years, i 'live in my bed' and im a lost soul, i dont want to be lost anymore im desperate what can i do to improve my life?
Hey Michelle do would you know if I wanted to show my business on YouTube I could just make a video showing my products or would I have to do something else? Would I have to pay to show off the products or would that not matter?
Hi mish,
I have a group of freinds, but one of my friends is always bullying, and if I tell them how I feel then a whole drama will start and they will not wanna be friends anymore. How do I get rid of that one friend without causing drama and losing well all of my freinds
hello
What's that thing on her right hand? Looks pretty cool, like a superhero glove... 😅 hahaha
Mich i have some issues about my "ex friends" we all used to be so good. then suddenly one of my friends met a new group. she comes to my group if she doesnt have that group (fyi im the one who introduced her to that group)
I'm early. When I come back from the market, I better have top comment
Anyone else singing Zayn?? No, just me... Okay
OMG a. I the only one sitting here trying to decide whether her pink and purple room is a cool tone or a warm tone!? Like seriously this is a hard question
Ha ha 😄
Great video!
Come throughhhhh Ms. Tran!! You're such an inspiration! 
Zayn has ruined the words pillow talk for me !! 😭😭😭 every time someone put that in their title I think of his song
Why is she wearing shoes on the bed ...
Why are you wearing shoes in a bed??????
Michelle what should I do if I know someone who cuts? it seems like common sense to tell an adult or someone who can help them but when you're in the situation it's really hard to do that, I just don't know what to do
do a no brush makeup challenge (use your hands)
I don't work, tutorial pleasssseeee. 
Ls it just me but does michelle sound like that woman on those calm CDs 
Ehh..Who finds it weird/uncomfortable to observe people wearing shoes on their beds here??
What happened to your ring and pinky finger?? D: Is it okay?
What's on her hand? Is her hand hurt?!?! o.o
I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos when looking at the likes and views they get. She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots
I miss when this channel had makeup that anygirl in any situation could do. now girls like me who don't have fancy makeup or the money for anything you use. I was a subscriber for years, but I had to unsubscribe cause of all the high end stuff. I came back to see if it had changed... but it's still the same stuff everywhere you go.
Honestly I hate these new videos. They're so boring! I feel that so many people feel they have to stay subscribed to Michelle but they obviously don't like the new videos (when looking at the likes and views they get) She has stated literally that she is too busy for YouTube. If that's the case, people should unsubscribe if they don't like the new content she's uploading and maybe make her think about what it was that got her success in the first place. It's good to grow and do new things, but you should never forget your roots, and I feel that Michelle should make a video being straight up and say that she has moved on from YouTube or something because she does not connect with her subs like she used to.
I very very like it
What's your native language?
What's your life update? Are you still with Dom? What did you do on your YouTube break? What does your next chapter mean?
Michelle I have an idea I've been starting on my YouTube channel but I also had an idea of making my own skin care line I'm young I'm not sure I can do it I was wondering if you could give me any tips also could you give me any tips on my YouTube channel I've been making make up videos and I really need your help I'm determined to get this job done and I'm determined to do my dream but I need help
Very cool video!
nice
Hey Michelle phan, hope you are going well. I am from China. Do you have an idea of building up a team with Chinese girls? I have been watching your video since 2008 when you just started to launch your video online. I really love it and I feel really inspired by your video concept that can encourage women find their confidence. If you can response me, I will be very happy:)
Krufo
Hello I have a video on my channel. there are a few more to come but I will write to starting my videos in English because I see a barrier of anonymity in English. and I will make no sound so you can look at the pictures that I show no matter where you are. they are all my photos that I made myself. i am from germany
cute
Michelle what happens if there is someone in your life who is the " plague of bad things / depression" and they spread it among your friends and then they hurt you of felling some and sometimes you want to curl up and die? What should I do?
Hi Michelle! I've taken a look at your Em cosmetic on the website. Your colors are so great. However, if there's more fun and bright colors for eyes and lips I will love your brand much much more!
OMFG YOUR THE BEST YOUTUBER EVERRRR!!!! You inspired me to make my own videos and I hope one day I will be as motivational as you :) You can always make me smile on a bad day and you give out such good advice ! Thank you for making your videos . Shame you don't make them more often but I know you have a lot going on haha XD
Why are you wearing shoes on a bed? :) Keep it low with women power... it's already striking back... I am coming from a western country and we have the highest single and divorce rate ever in history. Do think that's progress? Women making themselves unattractive by being exaggerated self concious? If men don't have power, where do you want them to be? What's their task?
are you american? you look like chinese!!
Hi, Michelle! I had a mastoidectomy when I was a baby, which means a part of my inner ear had to be removed. Because of this, it resulted in auditory processing disorder and ADD. It takes me a long while to pay attention and really understand what anyone is telling me. Do you have any advice for this? How can I push myself to focus?
YOU WILL ALWAYS REMAIN YOUTUBE QUEEN TO ME <3
i wanna meet you SO BAD! T.T
Something felt extra personal about this trend report, really digging it. Two Instagram accounts I highly recommend are veeceecheng and ownthelight. Hope all is well :)
No lie- I said the same thing in the studio. "So can I give my street fighter dying voice?" It was so hard no to echo my death like they did. LOL Can't wait to see how you did as Jessica!
 Cure has been my hg since forever ☺️☺️😊
I am definitely in love with your channel all over again.

Yesss! I love the style of this trend report more than last years! It felt more personal and relaxing to watch! Last years episodes remembered me a bit of popular celebrity shows on TV for some reason! But this years trend report is perfect! I can't wait for the next episode! <3

just finished my tutorial and already seeing 
them everywhere! I'm super pumped for SPRING :)
I can't. I love this series so much.
i love it when youtubers recommend instagram accounts like thanks for noticing those creative people out there that may not have attracted that much attention otherwise
Those fashion trends have been around tumblr since about 5 years ago or so
SHE DIDNT CREATE THAT LOOK TF OUTTA HERE WITH "bbhoodz"
space buns are my main reason for growing out my pixie cut!
I got my February bag and didn't have one of those items in it.
I was so happy when I received the Josie Maran illuminating wand in my bag since I've been looking for a great highlighter. Can't wait to play with it. :~)
Also happy this series is back!
Omg...this was an incredible video! Loved everything about it! xx Lisa <3

@makeviridianaup  💓💁🏻
What would we do without Michelle? <3
im at my office... where u at?

im next door!
The Artidote is an awesome instagram/facebook account! Art + amazing quotes = yesss
Great Video Michelle ☺️❤️
Thank you for the trend reports Michelle! 
-avidfollower-
BB hood is cool, but I feel like that style was already created years ago. Japan has similar aesthetics when it comes to lolita, and Melanie Martinez had this style for a few years now.
Yahooooooo my fav series! Thnks Mish😘
@alfredtea
@doremifa99
OMG you make me feel so much happier and you have such a positive energy!!!
The postmeat ?
I didn't hear that carefully
Its been so long since we've had a trend report
Btw needa add to the food category: Sakura-flavoured EVERYTHING!!
I was so sad when I didn't get the it's cosmetics in my bag T^T
Where is your bomber jacket from? I love it and I want it so bad!
Omg I love escapingyouth
Where did you get your jacket?It's so pretty😍
Suggestion for the Instagram Gallery: Sharon Lyn
These are my aesthetics omg, pleaseeee make a tumblr💕💕💕
we want ipsy in europe! ♡....why do they only send their bags in the u.s. and to kanada? ://
when you legit can't do space buns bc ur hair is too short for them
Michelle you inspire me soooo much. Thank you for being you <3
Hi Michelle! Long-time fan here! I would like to know your ideas about animal-tested products and veganism. I'm curious. Love you! <3
💜 This video is a treasure! Like everything is so helpful. Please do more of these. I've also been into the Space Buns and patches. I've done DIYs of them in the past.
Jessica Jones is my spirit animal 😍💖
your videos are so calming to watch im in love
Jessica Jones is my spirit animal 😍💖
I'm defiantly going to try the space buns ! Thank you so much your videos are incredible 😊💜
BBHOODZ seems to be such a cute way to style ❤️.
okay but the "bbhoodz" thing is actually really unoriginal I mean look at Melanie Martinez, shes been doing that sort of thing FOREVER
Bbhoods is literally Melanie Martinez
this was so aesthetically pleasing Mish thank you for that ❤️

love you Mish x
ahhh WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR BOMBER JACKET?!!

I adore Karen ( I love her style, editing, videos, etc), but isn't it inaccurate to suggest she's innovating and pioneering a style that's already a subgroup within Harajuku fashion?

I didn't get any of those products in my bag 😭
You should definitely check out @kpunkka in IG. His photography is amazing!

Michelle, the Feb. glam bag was adorable! I loved the design!!! :) Also it makes me happy that you and Karen work together and are friends <3 I love her so much, and I was like, "YASSSS!" when she met you and told us in one of her old videos she would start working at ipsy. This year I decided to try out ipsy (I'm planning to stick with my subscription for a whole year~!) thanks to you and Karen. I really wanted the pink gel coat, but I liked the products I received a lot! Can't wait for the March glam bag!!!

Its so calming to watch your videos.
this is basically one big ad
Every time I am trying to do space buns I failed hard.

I like these trend-report/pillow talk videos more than make up tutorials!
Ok but Harry Styles' space buns were everything!
Does anyone have the link for where to buy a jacket like Michelle is wearing but cheaply
MICHELLLE, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR BOMBER JACKET FROM
I was soooo happy seeing Zeemotion there. I've been following her work pretty much since I learned how to use the Internet (and about Deviantart). There's such a mysterious/ethereal/kind of rough aura to her  pictures. They're simply gorgeous

I love you michelle...
You really inspire me a lot!
Michelle's voice is just so cute lol
I'm not usually into beauty gurus but Michelle I love you so much your voice is so soothing and you really seem down to earth. Idk your amazing
"It feels so satisfying to rub"
Hi sweet Michelle!!! I recommend you in instagram #ahmet.erdem . Love you
please do a vid with karlie kloss! i think you guys would get along so well :D
Hey guys! I'm a male beauty guru and it would mean the world to get support from you guys💖😊
Downloaded Marvel straight away ! XD I personally prefer these type of videos rather than makeup tutorial 😂
YASSS i like how michelle includes creative instagram artists!!
check out Tyler Shields instagram. He's probably one of my favorite artists
You should make a lip gloss and lip liner that resembles candy in the packaging and content
I work at a restaurant and we don't care for postmates or doordash. They have a policy where the drivers don't tip the takeout order people. We work really hard to make sure the food is executed properly, so it's frustrating to not see a tip from the drivers.
Why can't I have instant relationships?...
You should look at lo.r.enart on Instagram Michelle!
I quite liked this video and love that you showed the ipsy bag 😊
I loooove the room you're in!
Are you and Dom still together?
Your voice is so calm! I love it, whathever you talk I would find interesting! Love you !
I actually thought about escapingyouth first :O
Hi Michelle!! You're a real big inspiration to me! That's all I pretty much what I was gonna say.... Well bye Mish! ❤
CURE Natural Aqua Gel and ColourPop Ultra Matte lippies! <3

SUGGESTIONS FOR NEW EM PRODUCTS:
*lip plumping lip balm (tinted)
*mascara that enhancesa certain color in your eye
*chiaroscuro stick (improved version with more skin tones to chose from)
*makeup product able to conceal peach fuzz
*eyebrow oil that tints and helps grow your eyebrows out as well
*mascara that thickens your lash line
*mascara serum to help grow eyelashes
*eyeshadow oil? (dries)
*lip oil/butter
*lip marker stain

Hope you enjoy my suggestions and I hope you use them!

Would really love to try it. xXx
I've been under a rock, no clue about this micro bead ban I had to Google it. 😶
1:12 reminds me of CL - HELLO BIXCHES dancer 😂
a decade ago we would call drones "stuff from the future" and holey moley the future came quickly
Hey mish. I love your channel. Your my inspiration. I want your book so bad but it's okay
Love this series, Michelle! You have really out done yourself with the creativity and passion you've put into this channel over the couple of years. It's awesome to see you continue to grow as a person and as an artist! Im always curious and excited to see what you're up to!!

I have a question about instagram since she mentioned it. I've seen accounts like the one she mentioned and I'm curious about something, how do they get photos like that? Like are they are just made on the phone and then posted or are they edited outside of the phone and then posted?
Please make ipsy international!!!
Hey! Did you go see superwoman's premiere?
How is this really beautiful, gorgeous and sexy redhead girl in 8:50 ?
Small account, my friend does it, the concept is pretty neat: @delightfulpackaging has some cool pics of nice packaging of anything
BBHOODZ reminds me of what I saw on tumblr alot a couple years again called pastel grunge. It didn't really have much relation to the whole grunge style like curt kobain  but I guess the more modern grunge it was like it. Or also that Asian style call... um, it starts with a K and its like baby, pastel instead, idk but I like it! :D
i love these vides so much
omg michelle I saw you on nicknight in the show called flip! i got do excited and you spoke so cute swiss german ! ly
Hey man,if someone is flying a drone around your apartment and filming you without your permission,the best way to get rid of it is with a Spas-12 riot shotgun.
@RonaBarphotos 💓❤
Hey Mish, I was hoping for a apartment tour? I'm sure a lot of others here on youtube would love one too. Love you!

Don't get me wrong, Michelle is my favorite beauty channel on YouTube but I really enjoy this series.

Great vid 😘

Michelle phone please make a volg channel
Part of me lusts for a drone thinking that my footage would turn out to be like The Perkins or something. In truth, I'd probably just be shooting aerial videos of my cat a lot.
I'm in Singapore and I really hope Michelle will bring it to Asia country! I love u and the products u collab with. Really hope u will read my post! Xx

check paperboyo!
Michelle phan can you do more diys
Looooooove u 😄😄😄😄💕💓
ooh girl where's your jacket from
Finally old Mich is back, feeling u r back to earth after unsuccessful business attempt with your own line. You should really learn the base of marketing and strategy in order to get well with the launching of any product, concentrating on targeting, segmentation and value proposition of your brand. Good idea should be hiring marketing and accounting  professionals who would estimate her future return on investments. Good luck with your re-start (referring to her last article)
hey michelle I miss your beauty videos
can we buy the bag alone?
Did anyone count how many times she said lowkey hhaa
Is ipsy international :((
i wrote phan proof in the search bar. This channel came up. Im depressing. Bye.
i can remember watching Michele back when she had 100 subs back in like 2009
love <3
I need ur jacket!
that was a blush stick?! OMG.. lol I've only been using it for lips. oops...
Swoozie sent me
I Play the avengers :D
OMG super awesome!
Em needs to come to the uk

I really loved this video Mich :)
Hope you don't mind :)) Suggestion for your Gram Gallery: IG: Nadzlustre & Jaye.wolf from the Philippines, very artsy!  Nice vid btw! xo :*
CHECK OUT CHARLOTTE MEI
FINALLY I HAVE A WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS STYLE AND AESTHETIC IM TRYING TO SHOP FOR !! #BBHOODZ  ughh u dont know how long ive been trying to ask google how to explain this type of style so I can shop for it specifically 😂😂 Any other keywords I could use? shops like inu inu, what else could they be called style wise?
this  has  to be my favorite  trend report due to the light shedded  on athleisure  style! :3
check out oamul 😍🙊🙊
do more trend reports
I love the trend reports!!
I love the way everyone is calling bbhoodz style as something that was created by Melanie Martinez which is total bullshit, bbhoodz is a brand and also I seen style like that before Melanie Martinez she's not that unique.
360 cameras are so freakin' cool !!!
hey I play that
I thought liquid lip stick was called lip gloss 😂😂😂
YEAYYNTREND REPORT IS BACK! 🤗🌸❤️
Where is her jacket from?! Love it
lol she was right next door
does ipsy ship outside US?
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I love iamkareno and bbhoodz style!
Tumblr in like 2014 lol
where is that "athleisure" clothing from? digging it so much <3
I really love trend reports! So glad it's back!
YESSS ANOTHER TREND REPORT
Space buns are Bantu knots 😒
ok im pretty sure that hair was a wig I could be wrong does anyone know where I can get that wig? its so beautiful♡♥♡
What would I do without her. She is such an interesting and beautiful person, she calms me down and I feel like I could listen to her for a lifetime
The Ispy bag that I got this month contained different items, I just uploaded that video a couple of days ago. So, I'm guessing not all bags contain the same products? That is interesting and certainly worth knowing..
ahora es tele marketing? :(
I love trendreports xx
@antonio_malkie instagram
@milcarhodes this awesome!
@miilkiest is a really cute instagram page and she does post some selfies but her instagram is really nice and neat (at least I think so)

There this one instagram page that kinda cool. I think you should check it Michelle. You check out instagram: @queenofluna. and anyway, I love all your youtube videos. ;)
Are you Korean sorry    the question ?
Bbhood reminds me of a style in Japan called "KidsRock". A model named Ayumi Seto wears this style alot! Lots of primary colors and kid-themed coordinations.
I love you, Mish! I'm so glad trend report is back and with you hosting it. Looking forward to all your new videos in 2016 :D!

She was so excited to open the ipsy bag

Michelle when are you going to make the ipsy bag deliver worldwide?? starts crying
This video kinda makes me want to purchase a drone, LOL! Just wanted to say that I finished reading your "Make Up Your Life" book last night, and it's a MUST-READ for any Michelle Phan fan! <3 Love how you detailed your story. What touched my heart the most is how you deffered art school and then scored your laptop! YAS!
Does anyone know the ending song that Michelle always uses?? I love it!!!!
where can i get the bomber jacket at 8.41 ?
guys , what's the deal with micro beads ?
Guys! Please help me to find facial puff exactly which Michelle shows in video! Thanks for link!!!!
Hi Michelle and team, what advice would you give on how to stop biting my nails? I want to quit but it's always not enough. Thanks! Much love!

You are wearing Michelle
Phan! I'm sorry but where there the phandom at?
Help!!!! My hair won't stop falling out. I feel like it's getting thinner everyday. Can you make a video with tips on how to strengthen your hair? I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Why are people calling them space buns? The buns Sailor Moon wears already have names. Odango, dumpling buns, and baozi buns are just a few of the names this type of hairstyle has been called for a really long time.
I checked out your website, I want makeup but my parents won't let me
I don't really know if she could take credit for that. I feel like that style is just an alter or softer style in comparison to pastel goth... Those go pretty hand in hand... So I don't agree that she came up with that...
bbhods=kawaii style?
where can you get the best patches did she say?
Ily 😘
So many awesome things! x
Bruh if you hate microbeads too then why are you sending out products with microbeads on Ipsy? >> please fix that
I think we could not suggest any interesting Instagram page by using #gramgellery as you can only view the tagged images from if it is added by the user him/herself as part of their caption. :(
I like Karen's style, it reminds me of what people have recently been wearing in Harajuku.
me?
I am so glad trend report is back > < 💖💖💖
Anyone have a recommendation for best liquid lipstick to try first? I love Red lips, Rimmel 107 is my jam! so I was thinking of getting a colorpop red.... But which one.... Any suggestions?

Aaaah yes I feel you about the whole selfie selfie selfie. The accounts you showed were aMaZiNg omg

Makeup look on this look?
Love that bomber jacket mish! 💚
8:27 that black body suit that says "et blanc et noir" is actually from topshop!!! bought it recently, it has a pretty cutout at the back :)
Dear Michelle,
I am your biggest fan ever!!!! It would mean the WORLD to me if you followed me on Pintrest. You taught me so much about myself and how to show myself in the best ways. My name is GothicGypsy22
You are a fashion queen
+Michelle Phan go to Philippines

I love the jacket you are wearing. Where can I find it?
What is that symbol at the end of your video?

I would be more excited if I got the trust fund nail polish instead of ciate in my ipsy bag :(
Great info!
I was waiting to see if she would bring trend report back i'm so happy she did!!!

"space buns" are bantu knots and they are not new something isn't new because white pop stars started doing it
OMG Food delivery is like THE FUTURE. I can't even find anyone to deliver pizza to where I live haha! P.S. There are lots of ebay lip lacquers that are super duper cheap and no branded - some of my favourites are ebay ones ! xx
I wish drones came to australia because america is like a decade away from australia

My brother made a drone😄
omg Michelle is like a walking collection of commercials now :/
can someone please tell me the name of the sporty style she talked about ? Im brazilian so my english is not that good.
I loooooooove trend report and this episode was AWESOME. Is there any way to get Ipsy abroad?
It's really sad that you don't know what it means because you have your own brand and develop new products. It's your job! Sometimes I'm asking myself what CEO's even do. Doesn't seem to be anything important..
Does she have a Line play account then?
Hello did not heard of american new law they Banned mico   beads
Can someone please tell me what purse that is in the background?? Also, hello, that MINI PURSE on the purse. I need it. Where do I get one from??? xoxo

Where did you get your bomber jacket from ?
I wish I got the glame bags. Feb was the bestest -_-
I didn't know that she created Ipsy!
That was awesome, thanks for sharing all that info. I love this months bag too and the photoshoot theme "Pretty In PInk" love that movie. Just filmed my unbagging for this months bag, glad to be a part of IpsyOS. Thanks Michelle for being such an inspiration. And so sweet in real life.
Will you be playing Pokemon GO when the app becomes available? If so, what would be your ideal Pokemon team? Mine is Snorlax, Zapdos, Spiritomb, Magmotar, Gardevoir, and Gyarados.
Can you integrate artists into the gram gallery? Because I have a few people in mind, who are very talented and show much talent and expose it to the public and I love their works. I'll name a few, such as cyarine, yoaihime, milkgore, sugarandcloth, benisaphotographer, hkcameraface, ignisart, bearbrickjia, jurikoi, kishishiotani, qinniart, ibu_chuan and yenpaii

I hope you can incorporate at least of few of these wonderful people! Although MOST are artists* 
Please do check them out and I personally think that all these people are amazing and are worth to follow! ^-^
i just LOL when i saw the word on the bag "take your bao" cuz in Vietnam the words "bao" mean bag/ plastic bag or anything we used to hold or bring something to anywhere
Drones are evil.... don't do it people
Where is your jacket from ?
where can you get the jacket that shes wearing?
I WANT THE DRONE!!!!!!!
Last time when you've been in Da Nang, I didn't have chance to meet you that makes me so sad T_T. Would you like to comeback again?
Tuesday Bassen, Robin Eisenberg, Bananna Bones, Sara M Lyons!!! I adore them and the whole Illustration community on IG! They make cute patches, pins, stickers, etc. These indie artists deserve all the recognition that You Tubers get because their art is creative and they put so much hard work into creating great stuff! Check them out!😊
michelleeeeeeeee ipsy to UK. pleaseeeeee.
Michelle should really do an ASMR video..her voice is always to calm and relaxing 😊😊😊
runnerkimhall, jennamartinphoto, michellisphoto, paulfuentes_design, photosarebullets, taxcollection, and candyminimal are all amazing accounts!!!
Awesome video! And cool trick with the sponge! I've never even considered using it dry! And please check out "Where_is_my_bookmark" on Instagram - it's an account all about books! Love you, Mish!
Someone today told me I was ugly because I have dimples around my nose and mouth when I smile 😓 But then I realized that you have the same dimples, and because you are so beautiful, it made me feel beautiful! I thank you. I have not been bullied in 4 years, and now that I was, it decreased my self esteem in a huge way, but now, I feel better... I thank you with all my hart. You probably will never see this comment, but I hope you do, not because you're famous, but because I love you and think you are an amazing roll model for me. 😌
the other day my darling lost his new theta... he is going to get another one tomorrow... yes theta is cool ;)
Wheres the athleisure wear from??
I saw the February ipsy bag and I just had an instant crush on it. Unfortunately I'm abroad right now so I can't have any subscriptions going on, but I'll try to get ahold of it somehow.
Does anyone know where she got those light up words that say dreamer
you look like Michelle phan o.o
you should check out Melru_Perjhane! she posts fashion pictures, though it's she does take some selfies
Check out the accounts @earth and @space
basically awesome stuff.......for rich people. I dont even know why i bother watching these when im too poor to buy myself some head phones.
BB hood colors are so pretty
a lot of youtubers are commenting here. then you know whos queen.
love these trends! liquid lipsticks are my life, it's basically all I wear now. I've gotten rid of most of my lipsticks because there's no point
I never got my ipsy in the mail this month but it said it was delivered :(
Chị có phải người việt không
where can I get that purple makeup sponge? and that whole athliesure outfit with the cropped Karma T-shirt and short shorts sweatpants that girl was wearing?
looks like I got the redheaded stepchild glambag.
Lol wtf bbhood? You mean Japanese street fashion? Invent something new lmao
Does anyone know the place she said is the best to buy patches because I couldn't find it in the bio and I couldn't make out what she said in the video :D (P.S. I really hope there will be a liquid lipstick in the March glam bag ;DDD)
Does anyone know what's the name of the song on michelle's levitating speaker on snapchat? thanks!
Where is her jacket from or one like it? I LOVE it!!!
Michelle, can you provide a link or contact info for the drone you mentioned in the video? I've done a bit of research and there is nothing even close to $10/day rental as you've mentioned. The most affordable one I found so far is about $80 per day. I'm in LA.
Michelle. I would live if you could do another celebrity makeup tutorial or any makeup tutorial. You inspired me to pursue Makeup and learn how to embrace beautiful things and for that I can not thank you enough. Please never stop doing what you do. ☺
Feels like an tv add couldn't watch the entire video- not legit stuff anymore. Congrats on the gigs but don't forget who you were, thats why people subscribe to you.  This come from a place of care not hate. Bye
I applied to be a part of Ipsy b/c you said that people from out of state were also welcomed.  My response from you all said I could not be apart.  Just course, why? Are there other things you look at when making your decision?
I need some advice on how to dress bbhoodz
I love Trend Report
How much does an ipsy subscription cost? X
is it just me or dose she seem a little more serious in her newer videos?
I would love if you could make a video were you talk about vegan (no animal products in the makeup and cruelty free) makeup-products :)
Is she still with Dom
Does anyone know a good shop/store where there are good athleisure clothes items?
gostosa
can you tell me the brand and type of the camera that recorded that scene? its too good
bbhoods is actually daddy little girl, except without the sexual stuff like this has been around forever???
Can you make a cashmere Kitty for make skin that is black plzzzzzzzz?
Where is Dome?
Am I the only one who finds her voice extremely calming?
Hello Michelle! I was wondering if you could peek at my account on instagram @my_flying_mini. Thanks it would mean the world! It's basically my mini horse Tinkerbelle :) Thanks and i love your videos!
Michelle! Im coming to LA this friday, and well.. I'm white as a ghost. I was wondering if you could reccomend any sunscreens for the face? I live in Norway and we dont really have a great collection of sunscreen for different skintypes. I have pretty oily skin, so I need something that wont break me out, but dont make me look all shiny and stuff. Hope you can help, but I totally understand if you don't have time for this :-)

Hey Michelle, let me just say that I loooove you so much! And I've been watching you since day 1! And I just wanna share something about liquid lipsticks. I find it easier to take liquid lipstick off by putting lip gloss over it and let it stay for a good couple of minutes. that way the dry formula would like moisten up an it will loosen up the product from your lips. You can wipe it off with a tissue afterwards.
i love zemotion. 💖💖💖
Check out teen.lush on insta they are really new and have like 4 followers or something but I love it
Russian jokes
Very enjoyed the video
@vgystore
i can't wait when drug store makeup have some affordable liquid lipstick.i wanted one but theyare a little over my price since im 16
If you want a good liquid lipstick then you should check out lime crime , if you like crazy colours you would love them
Wow
Hi Michelle! You are inspiring. I admire your entrepreneurial skills. My big sister actually religiously watches you videos recently that's why I get to watch you too. She's also an artist but more of in the serious side of visual art (gallery stuff) but she loves make up too since she's also a model in my country. By the way, I saw your Gram Gallery portion and it's a wonderful idea. Would you like to check out Manny Fontanilla Photography please? He is a brilliant Filipino fashion photographer and he does make up and styling on his models too. . He's a family friend. Very humble and kind. I hope you would notice him and may you include him in your Glam Gallery please. Thank you for your time. :)
hi
Wait.... MICROBEADS ARE BANNED? WHY ISN'T THIS A BIGGER NEWS THING? How tf am i supposed to exfoliate now?!!?!!?! 
Oh well I guess konjac sponge, clarisonic, etc... but still! It's not like women are snorting exfoliators now lmfao
Where is the bomber jacket you wore from ???
As if the babyhood thing is new 😒
Where did you get your bomber jacket
does anyone know where I could get that bomber jacket with the pink hand holding the rose on it
I want more trend reports
Where can I find that video with the girls dressed In pastel colors?
So... How do I get an internship with you mish?! I will be graduating college soon and you have been such an inspiration to me. You are an amazing woman and you have shown me throughout the years just where hard work can get you. I have been wanting to start up my own blog and begin doing some videos but I haven't been able to find the time, money, or courage. I would love to learn some pointers from you personally, I know that I'm not a big shot from a huge city but you have definitely inspired me to dream.
Please make more trend report as much as you can!!!!!!!!
where's she from ????
I love these trend report videos! please do more :)
Where is her jacket from?
This is just a commercial in disguise. -_-
Hi Michelle!!!! My name is Michelle as well😂❤️. my sister actually wants to be successful in makeup because she really enjoys doing it. She has an Instagram @kimquibeauty you can find many makeup tutorials that are beautiful and videos as well. You should really check her out!! Thank you💜 +MichellePhan
Hey, I really love your stuff! But as a plus size woman, it's only now come to my attention that you don't really feature plus size friendly videos. Even your stylists at ipsy are all of average size. I'd love to see you try and incorporate some plus size influence for people out there (like me!) that I really into what you are doing, but don't necessarily have the confidence or the means to do the things you recommend. I know it would be difficult for me to find athleisure style or bbhoodz style that was both flattering to my shape and wouldn't make people make fun of me. Plus size people seem like they always have to look sexy to be viewed as beautiful, or have to have amazing hair to be seen as worth it,... I mean the list goes on. I'm completely willing to help you with anything, but I would hope you'd find some way to try to include all types of people in your career. With love! Junkbeauty
Her bomber is killer.
are ipsy and em cosmetics still parented by loreal?just wondering because they test on animals and it would be very disappointing if michelle was testing on animals or promoting it by being parented by loreal.
👍🏽👎🏿👄😍😌😘😊😄😂🙂🎶👍😭👈🏼💩👍🏽💪😒😩💪🏾🙈💕😪😔🤓❤️😳😏☺️😁

OH MY GOD SHE WAS THE VOICE ACTRESS FOR THAT GAME CHARACTER I HAD NO IDEA! I was playing that game, but it kind of got boring T-T;;
Bbhood is like a normal fashion in east asian countries
That's was a wonderful video !
Where is her bomber jacket from???
hello
I remember you talking about some of these things in "The best of 2015" videos
I love the look of space buns! They're so cute :) great video as always, Michelle! xo
Jessica Jones isn't an Avenger, she's a Defender......
Does anybody know where I can find the dreamer light behind her ???
U live in an apartment with 8 million subscribers??? Ummmm idk about that....
Can someone tell me which trend report episode where Mich talks about what editing app she uses? thankiesss
Wayyyyy cool video))
I don't wanna grow up either, but why would I wanna look like a toddler as an adult? That just seems wrong and... Dangerous.
Where is your bomber jacket from?
BBhoodz is basically Asian fashion. The asian teenage culture (think korean and japan) embraces childhood. Hence you see many teenagers dressing up with bold colours and prints. Look up Kpop and Jpop!
Yes!!! Trend Report! Hey Trend Report!!!!!
hi new youtuber here xxxx any small youtubers wanna support each other xoxox
You should definitely do a video with the different price ranges of skincare! Kinda like how you did with the "best of 2015" video and you categorized all the different products based on price range. You should try making a video with an in depth look at skincare and then show the best toners, cleansers, etc. in the different price ranges
Im a vegan, healthy lifestyle instagramer and youtuber! :)
@RafaDIYLife
If you can check it out Michelle! That would be great! :) Thank you!!
Michelle where are your curtains from plsssssssss
she was right about the lipstick
Does anyone know where to get that iridescent colorful pad she has on her table?
Did anyone see her on snapchat? One snap she had this thing where it made princess peach and yoshi float. Does anyone know where to get it or what it's called? I need!
So fun to watch
This channel has gotten so legit😮
Michelle Phan my friends are moving and then I will have no friends I don't want it to be like 4 grade all alone eating PB sandwiches for lunch. I need help making new friends. Could you please help me. P.S. I love your videos so muck thank you for being in my life.
what color are you wearing on your lips?
@Creative_Tsurera on Instagram! Art, jewelry, crafts-  a lot of nerdy art
OMG!!!! The IPSY Bag is to Die for!
I love the Drones....I'm saving up for one so it can take my youtube channel to the next level!!!
I'm going to try the space buns tomorrow =]
Uuj
Can you do karai makeup tutorial from Nickelodeon teenage mutant ninja turtles or renet makeup tutorial and she is from Nickelodeon teenage mutant ninja turtles to plz Michelle phan :D
Cool video
You are the best I wish one day I see you face to face and give you a big hug I gave as ma and it is hard if you ever come to the United States of America please cost me I wish one day I give you a make up tutorial
I love these types of videos where you just sit down and talk about things you like or are becoming a trend, I really enjoy it!
Where is that video of the athleisure from?? I'm dying to know!
OMG I want a drone! You should totally do rentals for IPSY!!!! Obsessed with Karen's style I think I have a mixture of it in me I always say I dress like a 5 year old haha :D  HAHA so funny how she was in the other room!  I love liquid lipstick, you could also remove it with a greasy burger  hahaha I would love to do voices for cartoons! I did not know about these delivery services... omg I'm going to get so fat.... Omg 360 is crayyy ! I love the Cure aqua gel!  Ooo watch out calling every beauty sponge a beauty blender, BB might loose their trademark as it turns into a generic term  hahah I had not heard of this "space bun" trend, I need to try on a weekend haha I'm athleasure all day at lectures hahah
Why did she delete all of her vids?
Hey michelle! I was wondering if sometimes on Trend Report if you could post stuff leaning towards the masculine side. (fashion) Dont get me wrong, I love makeup and pastel looks and colors, but it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
I love your energy in this so much 😊😊
You know what? I think what Michelle is doing here is so incredibly selfless and humble. She is basically spending hours of research and spilling the trend "beans" for all of us to know and explore. Many youtubers will not do this. She is truly a professional blogger and innovator ! If you guys also read the caption you can tell it's literally only two things that's sponsored out of what like 12 things she recommended? So she's promoting these brands on her personal liking and experience, I think that is what it's all about and how YouTube stared, having a genuine connection to your viewers, and not your sponsorships. Way to go Michelle ❤️ love from Toronto, Canada !
Hi Michelle! I'm so so happy about this video, it seemed genuine, authentic, funny, quirky, etc. I feel like your personality was "shining through" haha and I loved the vibe/chattiness :D
Please make more videos like this and never hide the quirky weird part of you! I feel like you've finally found a way to combine insanely good quality videos and still let your personality shine through. GJ ILY!
Man I really want a drone! Great stuff as always!
Love your background! <3 <3
Like this if you didn't get any of that stuff in your glam bag... >,> or if you 90% of the time get hand creams or lip balms instead of makeup.. :( Im holding out Michelle I've been here many years watching your channel and partly because of you I am a makeup artist now who has been to school for it and freelances and works for Sephora..and I want to love your bag, I know it's impossible to like everything in the bags though.
I love this trend alert series!!!
Yes. I love the bomber jacket you're wearing in this video! Anyone know where it's from ?? 😍
WHERE IS YOUR JACKET FROM
The Ipsy Glambag was my favorite make up bag so far! Absolutely loved it! And the stuff inside was great as well!
Hi mich just want to say I loved this trend report. Feels very genuine and sincere. And it felt like an honest overview rather than a "push for product" we sometimes get flooded with elsewhere. Appreciate the content and loved the style of interaction here. ! Xoxoxo
ITS BACK !!!
Love the trends!  Always - thanks for sharing!!!!!💋
Michelle, its so nice to see your videos becoming so much more personal feeling! Talking to the camera like this is a lot nicer than voiceovers and it makes it feel like everyone can connect more with you and what you're saying as a person. c: Great job! I'm excited for every one of your videos.
I really loved this video!!!! ❤️
Michelle and I have the same phone yaaaay
+Michelle Phan can you create a makeup looks like a Vietnamese girl ?? with the traditional clothes too please share it to us how proud you ro be a Vietnamese ^^ thanks Mish. Love and hugs from Indonesia #AskMish

Michelle, you literally lit up when you started talking about your tipsy bag!!! I really love seeing when people are super excited about what they've created! Great design too!
Does anyone know where her bomber jacket is from?
Where is her jacket bomber from
my birthday is in 4 days and  dont see my dad any more and my mom is going away so im kinda all alone but i hope you have fun on my birthday which is the 20th love you so much you inspire me everyday to try something new love you
Love this! Such a cute video! <3
Seriously!!!!' I just got my Ipsy bag and I did NOT get any of those cosmetics!!!!!! It makes me so mad!!!!! Michelle I am cancelling my bag!!!!! You can't promote or advertise something that is NOT true!!!!!
Michelle you are such an inspiration and a hard worker. I was wondering if you could make a video or give us some tips about working women / students that don't get enough sleep and still want to look good in the morning? Thanks!!
idaandu she's a fashion blogger in the Philippines who is creative in every shot on instagram. her story is also inspiring because she had survived cancer years ago and now she has her own fashion line in forever21 please notice her for she only has 123k followers ♡♡♡
Zayn copied Michelle's series lets sue him
Love these sessions with you! Relaxing and inspiring 🎎
of all the youtubers, you have the calmest aura ever. You know what to say, how to say, and when to say them and that's why many women and men alike are inspired by you. I love your videos, but videos like this where you just sit down and share emotions and feelings like you have a calling in helping others. Your life story overall is inspiring. so, thank you.
Thank you for what you said about looking at your significant other's phone. I feel like that's something that a lot of people don't understand. Just because someone doesn't want you to see their phone doesn't mean there's something incriminating on the phone.
You are truly a healer . Your speech is so soothing
I love these pillow talk videos of yours. I feel so connected with you and I feel like I'm listening to my best friend. loved this video Michelle! ❤❤
Wisest, smartest youtuber ever!
Eeeeeeeh the mushroom pillow is so cute!
So how to change a person with attitude built on ego and arrogant?
how does it feel like having a song with the same title lol
the problem is most people don't accept listeners especially in my school, they usually consider them as shy or boring. I listen more than talk and I found out that most people think I'm boring or I have insecurities.
Michelle, you trasmit calmness, inspiration, beauty, modesty and courage to me.!
I feel as if your my best friend Mish, thankyou for that with these sessions. 💗
love how genuinely she's giving advice. instead of always supporting the asker, she'll point them in the right direction. her feedback on the phone/cheating question made me realize how mature and lovely she really is. :) <3
👏 your hair looks beautiful 😍
you are so genuine! I mean as a person I have liked you so much michelle. your body language and everything the way you talk and convey ur messages that is so convencing, may be that is a reason you get so many followers and also am from india and I tell everyone to follow you. keep it up for more Illyyyy♥
Your hair is so beautiful Michelle!! Can you make a tutorial for it? Love you lots!
for the next pillow talk, can you talk about the difference of paradise and war zone ? ;)
I loved the star wars example cause thats exactly what I'm wearing and experienced :D :3
Person reading this never forget that you are beautiful inside & out, smile lots and make the most out of every day, hope you have a wonderful week!! 💓
Great advice on social anxiety! I'm so shy and soft-spoken, but now I feel more confident when I start applying for more jobs!
Pillow Talk by Zayn Malik feat. Michelle Phan
It's like talking to my sister :)
This was such an amazing pillow talk, I absolutely loved it and a few of the questions you answered definitely hit home for me. Thanks as always ♡
She talks about things that other people are afraid to talk about. That's inspirational. Go mishh!!!
please don't stop making videos. I always feel more connected with you when you're uploading :)
THE OUTRO IS SO SOOTHING. HOW TO GET A FULL VERSION?
are mish and dom still together?
Now Zayn is all I can think of when I read your "Pillow Talk" titles. I'm mad at myself, lol.
I think the main difference between confidence and being stuck up is the comparison of yourself to others. Confidence is saying "I like myself because I think that I am a complex and interesting person, I like the way I look, etc and it doesnt mater what others think or do" whereas being stuck up is saying " I like myself because I am better than other people."
OMG you've got a room full of paid shills.
very inspiring! thank you a lot!💜
Why did you stop trend reports?!😢😭
I honestly admire Michelle so much! She is so real, I don't feel like I'm just watching someone on YouTube but connecting with you. Thank you for all that you share with us 💓
Michelle, thank you soooo much for all ur videos. <3 They inspire me very much. You're beautiful!!! Love you! :)
Well this is some deep post-coital pillow talk.
This video made me feel so motivated today! Your positive message is always so inspiring. Love you!
PILLOW TALK IS MY FAV VIDEOS OF YOURS EVER, I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I SAW IT IN MY SUB BOX
Loved this video michelle :) I have social anxiety too so this helped! is this ur room?looks lovely and so indie :D xx
Is it just me or everytime I finished watching Michelle's video I felt like I leave out of a magical place💓
You are so beautiful
I really love these videos from you. Their so helpful and inspiring. Sometimes it's nice to take a break from all the actual tutorials and just detox with some advice haha. Hope you're doing well Mish. ✨
Pillow talk my enemy my ally
The only 'Pillow-Talk' I care about.
Anyone wanna be kind enough and let me know if you gotta go to college to be a customer-service representative.
Michelle, I think you should have a weheartit account... 😊
clicked on this bc ZAYN
Your pillow talk videos make me feel like we're best friends. Love them. You're such an inspiring person <3
Pillow talk ahhahaha
I swear I've never watched someone who has inspired me to love life and myself so much other than my parents. I hope to meet you one day so I can thank you in person.
Love these pillow talks. You are so busy for being an entrepreneur but still take time to reply to our question. You are an inspiration for a lot of people and I am sure you will be for dozens of years more x3
I don't know if you've read the book Quiet by Susan Cain but a lot of what you're talking about resonates within it. If anyone relates to these issues, that book has changed my life for the better in ways I could never imagine 📖✨
Hi Michelle! I recently started watching your Youtube videos and honestly they are incredible. You are an amazing person and I envy your wisdom. You have taught me alot and your videos really help. I wish i could meet you in person. Such an amazing personality. Love you soo much! :-) ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"what's a good job for social anxiety?" "social media!!!"
I wore a band t-shirt to my first day of university and got a lot of people talking to me because of it. One of my now closest friends was one of them. I can second that one just has to wear what they like and love and people will come into your life who will spark new energy and inspiration in you! 
About the topic of handling emotions with being creative - it is such a big thing for me. One of my best works I have done while in a really bad condition emotional-wise. Obviously those are not happy artworks but they did help overcome all the sadness and anger that was boiling inside me.
Nice video. :)
that part about taking all your negative feelings and producing something creative out of it is true. i recently got fired from my job and it was very frustrating for me. i used to cry to vent out my frustrations but then i got tired of it and it makes me look ugly too. i decided to try cooking instead. i've never really cooked for myself or for anyone else before but today, it makes me feel so good. it makes me feel that i have accomplished something. thanks michelle. :)
did zayn steal the title pillow talk
she should've used pillowtalk as her background music
How do you figure out what you want to do with your life?
I really respect you for making this video <3
pillowtalk my enemy my ally
I love ur outfit and hair omgg and the first thing that I thought of "pillowtalk" today was the song by zayn lol
<3 pillow talk :-)
"I wonder who harry is"

thank you for posting this mish! I love your honesty and sense of spirituality. it really helped me to put things into perspective whenever im in one of those situations! ♥
Michelle, I let fear hold me back from doing a lot of things in life; how can I try to accept my fears and get out of my comfort zone? Love you so much!
You give me so much courage! keep going! Love yaa mish♥

Sorry I have to interrupt and ask where you got that Nintendo cushion from??!?

it's amazing how i always tear up from how much i connect with you and relate to what you're saying, i love your inspiring videos
You're so well spoken, I LOVE listening to your advice!! ♥♥♥

I love your big mushroom pillow, Michelle! So cute! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING, MICHELLE 😘
Love your hair. please do a tutorial on this look. love you ❤❤
You're the first big youtuber i've seen talk about social anxiety in a video, I wish it was something people talked more about. Also Love, love, love these pillow talk videos, you are so amazing at giving advice!
I love the terminology you used when you said, "How many people did you elevate?" I've never seen my interactions in that perspective before. Thank you!
Michelle, you're so incredibly inspiring, gorgeous, authentic, such a hard worker and always make such great content. I love how the passion for your YouTube channel just radiates off everything you do and I just wanted to thank you real quick for doing what you do and being so damn good at it <3
I seriously love this series, it's always so helpful! & uplifting &inspiring!
Hey michelle,
How do i forget a bad memory that continues to haunt me?
Lovely pillow talk!
As someone who used to have social anxiety a lot more than today, I think the most important thing is to try and get help to deal with it. I don't think you should creeate your life around your anxiety! It's definitely not easy to overcome but I believe we need to push ourselves at our own pace. I got help and I'm so thankful I did! I wasn't even able to say hello or goodybe to cashiers at grocery stores or look at other people on the street, so i would always walk around with my head hanging down, staring onto the pavement while walking. I nowadays don't mind these things. I'm still not as confident etc. as I would like to be but I believe we can all get there!
I'm currently trying to find an apprenticeship and I need to remind myself everyday that if I go for something that encourages my anxiety I'll never manage to be the person I want to be and I won't be as happy as I should be. It's not easy but it'll be worth it. :)

Hi,
I had a fight with a friend and she blocked me
It's really scary to walk pass her everyday at school.
She's ignoring me.
I want to get over it but it's starting to get me panicked 
How can I keep a confident ego without having her upset me
Oh my god you're perfection with your wise words. Love ya! <3

I love this series so much! You really go in depth and helped people have an open mind about certain situations. You're words of wisdom really helped me think about things a lot more 😊. Thanks Michelle and I'll be looking forward to the next pillow talk! 💖💖
Thank you for sharing :) I loved the part about having an honest person to talk to, and not just yes-people! It really got me thinking
I would love to work for ipsy someday, that would be a dream! :D
I'm literally in love with your room
your pillow talks are my favorites! i love you pls keep making such inspirational videos, it helps me go through hard days <3
been subbing u since 6 yrs ago and love you every day 💓
Love this mish! Helped so much! Love you xx Mad
The part about being with a lot of people was so helpful, I have social anxiety and I'm going to this Super Bowl party and I don't know anybody just the person I'm going with and he's very very friendly and social so I'm already getting nervous but the whole observing first and adjusting to the "party mode" is actually something I can do I just never thought about doing. So thank you!! I never thought about it that way 😊
I love that sign that's says "dreamer"!!! its so cute !! The little mushroom pillow from super Mario bros is so adorable too!! love the decor!! luv u Mish❤❤
omg michelle phan had the idea for pillowtalk before zayn LOL :D
You are so inspiring, I wish i could have more energy like yours in my life. Thank you for always doing the best for your viewers <3 I aspire to be a great youtuber like you <3

can you do a tutorial for makeup for wedding ?
This honestly really helped me out, thank you so much
You're videos are so amazing xx
the thing with social anxiety is to GET OUT THERE and I know that's also the problem and I'm speaking on my own experience. I used to have really bad social anxiety but I started to put myself in situations I knew would make me uncomfortable and little by little I'm getting better and I know this 100% to be true
Pillow talk videos are always my favorite, I appreciate them so much because it's always something that I need to listen to to inspire myself. So thank you!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Hey Mish! I was going through old videos of youtubers, and I watched one of ur videos, and it lost it's audio, and now it's like a subtitle. I also clicked 'The Golden Hour' video, and the audio is gone and the music's changed. Seriously, what happened?!
I've been watching you since you basically started youtube & I love all your videos! ❤️ you're honestly such an inspirational person & a great role model 🤗
Michelle! As always, another great video. This one is something I am definitely sharing on my Facebook because there is so much sage advice. I feel like I am growing everyday, and it's wonderful to have an opportunity to learn from you. I am forever grateful for all the hard work you put in the content you put out.  Thank you for staying true to your self, and giving me strength to keep pushing to achieve my dreams.

Love love love...!
You are a wonderful person Mish!

Thank you and keep up the good work!

Please please do another MishDom Q&A sooon 💕💕
I was suscribed to you for a while, then when you stopped posting as much, I unsuscribed.. but after watching your previous video before this one AND after watching this video, I'm glad that you're creating more content again. And I love this Pillowtalk series of yours. Everything you said in this video really enlightened me, especially about the confidence part in the beginning. Plus I can really sense the sincerity and advice in your words. Thank you for that Michelle ! :)
Thanks mish~love you~
This truly got some senses into me. Thank you Michelle!
Mish, thank you so much for posting this video. You have no idea how much it helped me improve and start to look at myself a little closer, be someone better. I am too very private and tend to observe my surroundings and the people I'm going to interact beforehand-- but once in a while I do suffer from social anxiety and I get worried what other people might be thinking and saying. Thanks to your tips, though, I am trying harder to leave this behind me. 
I live by myself and sometimes it's hard to find people who care enough about you to offer help or even constructive criticism, who want to see a better version of you, so your words reminded me I have to keep grounding myself, find some time alone to think and meditate about my actions and thoughts. I sometimes forget how thoughts are powerful. 
Once again, thank you! You are such an illuminated being! Always wishing you the best in the world x
lolz once I saw this zayn popped into my head
Honestly my favorite series ever !!!
thank you for this I love you so much!
People make fun of me because I love ASMR xxx
Mish is the Hilary Duff of Youtube

I love you Miss Phan.. 
Its so good to see you again  after a while..
Lately I have been thinking a lot about past and I have been regreting about a huge amount of stuff and that's actually "tormenting" me all days. I know it's something silly to regret things because you cannot change them anyway, but I feel I can't avoid it. Any advice?

Ps: You're a big inspiration. Love you!!
pillowtalk haha song and video both amazing!!😂😂😂
YOU KNOW WHAT UR RIGHT OMG

you should make a reaction to your old videos.😉
You are so inspiring. Thank you, Mich!
You should do a house tour! I love your room
Nice Q&A social tips. Figuring out how to be comfortable in your own skin is very hard. But once you start figuring it out and building confidence you can be a lot happier =)
Social anxiety and Judgement I experience that. it's So terrible.. and I worry alot of what people think
You're one of my favourite YouTubers. I have social anxiety and panic disorder and when I get anxious I like to watch your videos, they really calm me down. Thank you. 💞

How do I find that person? I've always wanted a friend or just someone I can talk to, but I can't seem to find someone like that. But I have social anxiety, so I can't make friends easily either.

Hi Michelle, 
First of all I wanted to say how much you inspire me and how much I appreciate you talking more about inner beauty on your channel! These types of videos really inspire me to be a better person and live my life to the fullest! Thankb you so much for that!⊂(･ω･*⊂)
You are so well spoken and it seems like you can put your thought easily into words... I have a problem with that... I often feel like my mind is very busy, to the point that I have no idea what I've been thinking about... When I am talking w/ someone or I am trying to explain something, I never seem to be able to put my thoughts in words. My confidence isn't that great, and everytime I end up stuttering and 'uhmm-ing' my way through conversations etc, doesn't give my excactly a boost. Do you have any advice or mabye some tips/exercises that I can try?   
Lots of love, from the Netherlands
Indid a valentines day makeup tutorial, check it out💗
Oh my gosh , you are such an old and beautiful soul!! Good to find a youtuber to relate to <3

I think that these videos are very inspiring. It really helped me and I think that you really put so much time and effort into this. You are very smart and I hope you keep being awesome!!
Love this pillow talk same with the other ones but you put information in perspective, to brake it down and try to understand what people are going threw. So thank you for making these Pillow Talks ^_^ ! +MichellePhan
Your videos are sooooo relaxing and you are so great with words, wow. quality is out of this world when it comes to you and your videos.
I usually always try to please everyone :( but at the end as you said u don't please yourself.Thank you for the tip, I will try to please myself more instead of pleasing others
I learned a lot! ❤
You dont know Michelle, but when you said good luck it meant the world to me.. these past months were so hard and challenging I needed you just to wish good luck to me.. Thank you!
You have the most soothing and calming voice ... Just what I need before bed time 😴
If my room was that pretty, I wouldn't even sleep on that gorgeous bed because it's too pretty and I don't wanna ruin it haha 😂😂 Love you, Mish! 😘
Michelle! Your calm and introspective talks really inspire me to become a better person. I am someone who (for most of my life till now) has been unnecessarily bitter, short-tempered, stubborn and weak. But in the past year, people like you, along with exposure to beautiful things such as music and art, have really helped me appreciate life more and respect the people around me. Keep being the awesome person you are :* <3 xoxo
you are amazing
A minute in I put this in my favorites. This really resonated with me and you are such a beautiful and wise person.
hi!! I was watching your confidence video and had a question about it....on Wednesday, I was outside in one of my Highschool classes, rotc, its like a military program, and I overheated aka. passed out really.. I mean I would have felt better if I made it to the bench and said I didn't feel good, but I was so dizzy I tripped and fell on ground!!😒😒 it was soo embarrassing and even though I felt sick I still felt kinda shameful? I'm really shy and embarrassed so my mom let me stay home the rest of the week. it's now Saturday, I need some help because I don't wanna go back to school and cry because all the imaginary pressure...would u b embarrassed? what would you do in this situation? I really need like some helpful truth advice right now.. can u help?
your makeup is on point in this video mich! you rock the wing, it suits you so much!
So practical and real advice :) That Michelle Phan :)
I really appreciate your gratitude and your humble demeanor. I have been watching your videos for years. And I think you deserve your success 100%. You have worked hard and you are so creative. Not only that, but you have used your success to help others be positive and have fun and that is really saying something about your character. I'm super happy for you, and I think that people should absolutely look at your story and see that if they work hard toward a goal, and they stay positive, and keep moving forward, anything can happen.
Michelle Phan, you are such a beautiful person.
I need a diy to the room, it look so peaceful and calming
Can u make tour room video? luv u :*
Like the new outro after your  videos. :)
i love you i love you soo much mish thanks for the video
Michelle, my best friend is a guy, we are really close and I really care about him. He is always light hearted and funny and is kinda our class clown. Lately, he's seemed quieter and always looks tiered. When ever I see him in the halls and he doesn't see me he is frowning, I ask him if he's ok but he always tells me that he is fine when I can tell something is up. And a few times I caught him flexing his muscles and comparing himself to other boys on the swim team during practice. I want to ask him if he is having problems accepting himself but I don't know how to ask. I want to help him but I don't know what do or say. This has been bothering me, it's hard to find that the person who seems so sure of themselves really isn't. 
What should I do? 
I love you soo much 
Thanks to anyone who can help me and my friend.
pillow talk huh i remembered of my king zayn malik
Hair tutorial please?
the clothes thing is so true, if I'm wearing stuff that doesn't feel right then I'm always worrying if someone notices and what they might be thinking and all this extra stuff s.a. struggles
Mish !! What lipstick are you using !!! So beautiful ! <3 and that's for the pillowtalk this topic was what i wanted :) xxx
thx mish I was going thrue a hared time of betrayal with my freined of 4 years so thank you for making this vedio I now know what to do thx 😌😌💥💫
Love that you are an observer at first because thats how i am and than will act on the situation thats occurring.
Your videos are so true.
Hair tutorial please!
Totally agree w/ the confidence vs arrogance part. I see so many successful, highly educated professionals who exhibit arrogance or big ego that it's a complete turn off. They tried to be super confident, but they're just hiding their insecurities. I also notice that some of these people blame others or get defensive when confronted. That's an even bigger turn off. Yup, self acceptance is really important. If you don't accept yourself, you won't be confident, and it shows. Thanks for sharing!
"and her username is @harrysfav_ i wonder who harry is" hahahahsg
I miss you Michelle Phan so so much!
4:47 i always hear whispers from strangers whereever i go. they always judge me! why?? teens adults schoolkids judge my look. im happy with what i wear.

This was so helpful. I always try to please others and at the end, I am left with nothing because I never do things for myself. Michelle is so smart, I love getting advice from her.
zayn malik pillowtalk just came to my mind
The advice of betrayal is soo true I usually do that...
Michelle I know that you are helping a lot of people with these videos but could you make a video that everybody can enjoy
This is so helpful. Thanks, Michelle.
You are so incredible, Mish!
It's tuff for me too communicate with people and it's really really hard for me too be socially active also i cant probably talk with my family and I'm trying to find a job
Pre-Order Mind Of Mine and buy PillowTalk and iT's YoU by ZAYN on iTunes.

You re so smart👍🏾
Michelle, I absolutely love you. But as a person with sever social anxiety, I can tell you it's 100% not that easy.
where the phandom at? Michelle (Phan) :0
You inspire me so so much! You make me think about my own reality and also make me feel more confident in doing my own thing, whether it be fashion, style, makeup, social media, ect. You help me realize it's okay to work what I want to work because I love it. Also, you help me look deeper into myself to be a better version of me everyday and I want to thank you for that. Your videos are definitely amongst my favs and I look forward to each one. <3
In-depth video; very inspiring!! :)
love you mish!  you r sooo wise for your age.   and really digging that ear ring <3333

Does English have the phrase pillow talk before?
Aww i love your advice!
who doesn't love a big sister like Michelle. <3
it weird that I have never met you yet it warms my heart to listen to your pillow talks. 
I think that's what you talked about, spreading good vibes. :)
where'd you get your neon sign?
Michelle, thank you for being the big sister I never had!
this video helped me SO much.
woah, where have i been? i haven't watched any of Michelle's pillow talk videos and whaaaat, I've been missing out. your videos are so calming and relaxing. this was such wonderful advice. it caught my eye because you were talking a little about social anxiety, and i'm trying to deal with my anxiety at this time in my life. thank you. i'm off to go watch the first five now<3
I love this video series it literally makes me believe I can get my life together
Just a question are you still with Dom
WOW....your hair is out of this world, Mich! It's beautiful :D
I love you mushroom I have the same one 😂😂
omg i really love your outfit and your hair < 3 also you are so cute i love you
Mish you are amazing <3
Michelle, your videos have become quite like a beacon for insight for me. I watch these pillow talk videos knowing that I'm gonna click out with extra knowledge in my pockets. You're doing something absolutely wonderful. Thank you.
You're SO nice with us♥
Hi Mish! this is in response to your previous video on Ipsy and Em. What if Em develops a serum foundation that can cater to all skin types. You know how Clinique has got the smart serum so that it will work to provide benefits that your skin needs, but for foundation. This way, you don't have to worry about whether or not you have an oily skin or dry skin, because the foundation will know what your skin type is and works to give what it needs to look flawless.
please write a non beauty book T.T
I love you're relaxing voice
Omg, everyone's making videos on my birthday, Alleluia :')
My mum is also the one who keeps my ego in check! She is the best reality checker ever although she might get a bit harsh sometimes.  XD
You're so awesome o
This is just what i needed, ty Michelle <3.
next pillow talk please do something on crushes
My respect for her just grew so much!!!!!! 😌💖
Luv u too!!! U do have become more mature and grow from watching this video~
I'm leaving a huge piece of my heart here~

You are goals😫❤️
you're soooooooooo inspiring to me and I feel like we've  known each other since birth when you talk pillow talk or any videos you do, I love you so much. 😊
I find your voice so relaxing, i'm french so my English is not very good ^^
Thank you, Michelle. As a gay asian man, listening to you speak on how to really self-reflect has brought a smile to my face. Thank you for all that you do. :)
I love this pillow talk. It was definitely an eye opener with some of the questions and I love the perspective that you give us. It really does make it seem like you're right across from me and being my older sister haha Love you Mish :)
Am I the only one who thought she's making a reaction video or something to Zayn's Pillowtalk , because of title? xDD
hi Michelle Phan , i Love your channel . I watched a lot of your make up videos , but it my first pillow talk and  I love it . I was wondering if you could do another one about how to gain true confidence and dealing with rejections.thanks
I dont know why but michelle's voice is so calming
this video inspired me so much
I don't understand why these Pillow Talks is so inspired and really really really helpful (to me personally) but its views are not as much as others...
I love these pillow talks all the jazz but I do miss your old videos. Like even recent make up videos seems doesn't really surprise me. I remember the days when you posted videos with special effect such as lady gaga or vampy gothic look a few years ago. I also do understand those videos take such a long time and your busy with your own business and all, but would you mind maybe making one of those again please?
Always love you and support you xx
You will always be one of my idol. Love you!
Thanks Mish! You've inspired me xx
I've watched you ever since you started YouTube.
I love your hair! I enjoyed your input! You're  like a modern day shaman ;)
thats music at the end of the video makes me feel like im floating in the universe that is in the video too.
I love these videos , makes me feel so relaxed :)
I love these soo much! <3
i would love to meet you one day
#PillowTalk7 How can you put those questions behind you and carry on?
I am an infp, I can really relate to this :)
I just started watching you and so happy I found your channel.
Hey Michelle♡
I just want to say thank you for the pillow talk videos :3 
They're my favourite videos you make 
Sometimes I can't sleep and I feel scared and stuff like that and a point where music won't help me 
Then I always watch your pillow talk videos your voice makes me calm down and it's just gives me a nice feeling and I think I'm not the only one ♡♡♡
Thank you ♥ 
Love you♥
very helpfull vid thnx mish! :D btw i love your hair do.. do you want to do a tutorial of it?? ^^
YESSS PILLOW TALKKKKK
I LOVED watching this. You are so special Michelle! Thank you for the amazing guidance and advice <3

Love these videos Michelle, I feel like you're my older sister when I listen to you :)
i enjoyed this :) x
pillow talk get it lol
You have Wisdom
Michelle you are just so amazing! You are so sweet and down to earth I love you so much! You are so different from those monochrome beauty gurus with monochrome video formats and monochrome content. Like literally they all start with mainstream music and a thirty second preview of what's in the video and then comes the next 5 minutes of them trying to get on with the video but keep dragging it on and on and stalling from the actual video! And then after those 5 minutes of time wasting, they finally start the video that is very similar to other beauty gurus! And has anyone else noticed that those other beauty gurus have the exact same thumbnails? But Michelle is so different! Her format and Michelle herself are just unique, creative, warm, welcoming, artistic, and beautiful inside and out. She is such a role model and an extremely hard worker that proves you can start from the bottom and work your way up to the top! She's so inspirational and I look up to her so much. Love you Mish! 😘
I'm your subscriber from other accounts. I was ur subscriber when you have 10.000 subscribers. I'm so proud of you girl! Keep shinin'!
Try do a live chat sometime mish
This has helped me a lot because I have really bad social anxiety love you
firstly i thought zayn 😁
I love your pillow talks Michelle! Thank you so much for making them! I am young and at an awkward stage and you are my role model and help me through so much thank you <3
I love you Michelle phan😊
Wow, tbh I've never watched any of these videos, but I'm glad I started with this one.
Dear Michelle, 
As I'm lying down on my bed & just watched this video, I can't tell you how much this "Pillow Talk" meant to me.
Because, I'm usually the one always counselling, listening & motivating my friends. And, people forget that I too may need someone to talk to.
Laying down on my bed, listening to you made me feel like I'm talking to a best friend.
Thank you! 😊💖
i love this channel and you, some you tubers dont even interact with fans but you always do, and has there been a pillow talk about love?
michelle for president! mama phan <3
I have to quote you on that Michelle. Confidence vs arrogance.
mish! hi omg if you're reading this ily <3

anyways, do you have any tips for me? im learning how to use eyeliner and i was wondering what to do because my eye keeps twitching, and i don't know what style is best for my asian eyes >.< please help!
Oh my God you're so adorable I just wanna hug you!
your videos are amazing
I miss you DIY
Absolutely love you, Michelle. My role model since I was 10 years old. I feel so much better when I watch your videos, you put off a vibe that makes me feel like everything's going to be okay and that I can achieve anything. Thank you <3
lovely as always mish :)
These are so great because I feel like I handle issues that are discussed on this series well, but it's still wonderful to sit down and hear someone else's opinion on the topics. Thank you Michelle!:)
I'm still struggling to find the song. Like I keep on looking up Pillow Talk. But it goes to different artist that doesn't play this mellow vibe this makes me feel
These get better every time. I love hearing from your own experiences - any examples you give are great because it helps me imagine what you're talking about.
please please please do Harley Quinn makeup, she so cool so are you!!! Please! :3
Please make a video on what you did on lunar year and your make up/ skin care look
thanks for inspiring me 😢😚
I love watching these! Thank you Michelle! You are soooooo inspiring!
I love watching these! Thank you Michelle! You are soooooo inspiring!

Can you talk about bullying, or making friends? love you :)
where did you buy the lamp behind you?:)
love u so much :)
i feel like she should have a podcast for this kinda video :) LOVEEEE PILLOW TALKS !
Even if I didn't ask these questions. I learned so much. I'm going though this betrayal slash heartbreak and what you said made me want to do something I have always thought of doing but wasn't sure it was going to turn out well. I feared people would try to destroy what i create but you made me want to do it. Want to create it for it was what always came to my mind when I wanted to clear but head of the thoughts of the boy who hurt me. I thank you very much Michelle. Love you!
thought of zayn lol lol
Wait, where can I send her my questions? 😊
Thank youu soo muchh Mich 😢😍
She's amazing

I love this it made me tear up.

Michelle!!! can you recommend books? please
You're so beautiful inside and out Michelle. You always make me see things in a different way.
Dear Mish, 
 I thank you so much for making the videos. You inspire me a lot with beauty and how to not give up when facing challenges. Also, since I watched your videos, I have improved my English a lot, I learn it from the way you say things and how you communicate with people (I'm an ELL, hope that I say those things in correct grammar :p). Cám ơn chị Michelle nhiều lắm :)
Michelle , OMG we have the same name and I have a question. How can u try to keep those feelings how u feel for a classmate  who thinks ur her friend  but isn't. How do u break the news to ur friend gently
Michelle you are beautiful in and out.
desearía que este video este subtitulado en español 😢

You're really inspiring! Thanks for all these pillow talk videos :) 
I need some help....... Do you know how to add a profile pic to your account because idk how and I want to ?? Pls help
This is off topic here but I would love to see a vlog or two from you. Not like your travel videos (which are great) but something more genuine. I would love to see your day like when you first wake up with eye boogers,  coffee runs, work, late night Netflix with Dom idk just thoughts.
Michelle! How'd you do your hair? (It is a clipped top bun and then a braid for the bottom? or idk because the top looks like the start of a french braid.) It looks so cute! <3
WHERE ARE YOUR BEDSHEETS FROM????
hey michelle ♡ i wondered why ipsy does not ship to germany. would be soo happy if you could do something about that. :-*
whats your nationality?
hey Michelle by chance do you have a video that expresses multiple skin tones if not could you do one or a few
what happened to the YouTube channel press start
You are amazing Michelle!
Such an inspiration
I love your hair in this!!
i thought youll talk about zayns song
Hi Mish! What if em develops a serum
 foundation that can cater to all skin types. You know how Clinique has got the smart serum so that it will work to provide benefits that your skin needs, but for foundation. This way, you don't have to worry about whether or not you have an oily skin or dry skin, because the foundation will know what your skin type is and works to give what it needs to look flawless.
Your toad pillow is the cutest.
I loved this video 💖
Can you play more video games?
Thanks !!
hi mish 
I'm sitting here watching your video and it's made me cry. I've been stressed out for a couple of months now with work, my manager puts me under so much of pressure that my chest starts to pain every time she calls my phone or she's around me. she constantly bullies me infront of other staff and tells me what I must do differently (including wearing more makeup). today she implied that I should have worked through my lunch break although I always do if she tells me to, this makes me feel so depressed. I feel like I'm not human enough and I don't deserve even a lunch break. I'm so depressed and stressed out, I feel disrespected and violated. I do all the administration where I work including what she was to do. no one knows what's going on accept my boyfriend and the rest of the staff on out team who keep advising that I speak to her manager.  I'm so drained, I don't have the energy to deal with this anymore. please help
You always reach me. Deep within. All your videos are such an inspiration. It´s amazing how that works. And I think thats a part of your huge success, you can inspire people just because of your presents and your existants. I hope that make sense :D What I´m trying to say is that you are a great person. And you deserve all of the success and all of the love, because i really believe you, when you say i love you guys. Thank you for that.
Now I know where Zayn get the idea to name his song Pillowtalk! 😂
Hi Michelle:) I love and u r amazing :) thnx bye

Everything you say resonates with me so much. Watching your pillow talks always helps to make me feel less alone. I'm so grateful for your presence and this series.
You are my hero Michelle.

Karen boy kalyana

I am glad to see you up & running again and I hope you can make more tutorials and maybe do voiceovers for your old ones. If that is something that will further you too & I really appreciate your videos and advice. Please and ThankYou! XOXO Fug In the good way! 😉☺️
plot twist: Zayn secretly watches Michelle Phan's "Pillow Talk" series and got inspired through it to make his song "Pillow Talk"
Love your lip color! Love your hair! Love you, Michelle! xoxo
preach <3
at first I thought it had to do something with zayn's song 😅😂😂😂

She's so right! You're future is all on you. <:
I need a room tour
oh man, Mish. I cant help but think how far you've come, who you became, how you handle yourself,  Im so proud of you. I watched you grow up by watching your videos and im glad youre happy and successful, you will always be an inspiration to me. ^_^
great job michelle!!
Remember last year when you made that skeleton make up tutorial what kind of face paint did you use wondering 😶😶😶
I wonder what happened to Dom...
Love these videos❤️❤️❤️
i'am really learning from this...
YOUR TIPS AND LIFE GIVE MMEE LLLIIIFFFEE!!!!!!!! 
that made no sense
Can someone please tell me.... Is Mish and Dom still together?
I have social axiety myself and i think if you have got social axiety and your trying to get a job as hard as it may be you just got to go for it. If your trying to get a job in a field which you are passionate about it will be less stressful. Good luck guys! You can do it.
Any small youtubers want to help each other out??💖💖
your soul is so beautiful :) God knows so many people look up to you and you offering your advice and input is a great way to give back :)
Hello michelle !  I love you're stuff you're just amazing ♡ i would appreciate if you do a tutorial about valentine day ! ♡ like : what to wear , simply makeup and what kind of activities we can do :) love you from france , please keep inspiring us !^^
Your just like my mom she is so wise and you are wise to she cares about people but doesn't show it you care about people but you do show it 
It's just I wish my mom showed more love
harry?..... harry styles!!!
Does anyone know the name of the song in background?
I miss old Michelle
Hey.. What is the background music?
Someone copied your video title xD
I don't think I have ever had anxiety with social settings. But my husband is the complete opposite. I can't imagine being fearful. But I have seen how hard it is on him.
Thank you!
Mish, if you get a chance to do the tutorial can you please do Baby Firefly from House of 1000 corpses for me please. Thank you, it's for Halloween.
dude your lips it's so perf
What song did you use in the intro?
i love you , thank you very much
You should do some diy videos
Lol, you know, the ONLY way I found out my ex cheated on me was through breaking into his phone bc I knew he was hiding something. If I never did that, I would have never known about the lies. It's closure when you find out about cheating. I feel so much better. And I trusted my gut.
I LOVE YOU MISH ❤️
Zaynzaynzaynzaynzayn 😂😂😂😂
#PillowtalkForLife

Cool before Zayn!
Thank you for your pillow talks. There is so many negative views and feedback that people do but you have to be strong and embrace your uniqueness thanks for giving me confident Michelle. <3
Thank you.
Thank you Mich!
michelle would make a great mom
I love you Michelle
Lol you should sue Zayn Malik
Is she still dating that French guy
where did dom go?
She is like the daugther of YODA. 😇
❤
I constantly struggle with social anxiety and also having a big ego where I always want to look/feel/be the best. I think you distinguished "self-confidence" and "stuck-up." It's hard in today's society when putting down others, shaming people for making mistakes, or firing negativity at more negativity is "funny" and "cool" and shows "sass." I hope to work even more on keeping my ego in check and spread positivity and creative energy around me. <3
Hi Mish 😊 I LOVE your videos. You're so wise and I don't always have people who I can go to for advice so thank you for these videos! Can you also do drawing lessons? I really want to draw but I don't know how to do it that well. I want to be able to just come up with a drawing on the spot which I haven't been able to do. Thank you if you read this 😊
love you!
Mish, More Makeup vids please!
#pillowtalk love you. my friend constantly comes to me with serious problems and I think she should see a counsiler because I don't know if my edvice is actually helpful but she doesn't want to talk to anyone what should I do I think she might have depression. 💕
I think Harry is Harry Styles ..
Your maturity Whaooo me. 💕 Michelle.
Michelle,  this really helped me out. I do experience social anxiety. I get soo nervous around ppl and speaking to them in person can sometes really freak me out. I am better when it comes to writing and drawing and I've noticed that I express myself through these mediums. I need a job transition ASAP. I currently work as an optician apprentice
YOUR HAIR!!!! How!??
Michelle! I met you at gen beauty and handed you a note!! Did u read it??
great video michelle u inspire me so much
Michelle Phan is beautiful.
Hi, do u remember Adande?

See you in court Zayn.
I just love you
ooohh that making something creative out of negative emotions is such a good idea!
@: Any advice for people who have a very unique and different name,i am kind of an introvert so for me to be explaining my name gets hard.Or advice for students , motivation ?
Excellent video! LOVE these videos so much !
so posh
I love u mich ! You're such an inspiration I hope I can see u in person and get some hugs ! Mhuaawhh !! One of your milllions fan here in the Philippines😘🌸🌸🌸
Did you and Dom break up? If so, Im sorry! But im sure its best for you
Mish! Do you listen to kpop? Weird question but I don't think I've ever heard you mention it, sorry if you have and I just didn't know >~<
I wish you would come back! You’re beautiful! I love your voice, your smile, what you stand for, etc!
i hv watched all of ur videos but its my first time watching one of your pillowtalk series and i love it! esp the social anxiety part. my bf hv told me the same as you but it feels like he just said it and didnt really help me at all. hv no idea if he didnt mean it or what but anyway, thank you mish for the advices 😄😄

Michelle I love You  and all but what happened to the makeup tutorials, i Miss them,:)

i wish mish reply to my comment ;(
Can I ask a question here as I don't have Twitter? 😊
I have a friend and she is always lying to me and I have lost some trust in her. I don't want to be friends as I never feel happy when I'm around her. I don't know what to tell her though 😖 I need some help!
About the bretrayal part is so true. When I feel emotional , I draw . Once I do something like that, I forget everything that happened to me. That doesn't mean I forgot everything and forgive .:')
did anyone else think she was doing a cover of pillow talk - zayn? cos I did, lol
Love you Mish!!! I don't have a social media account, do you check comments for questions? - Love Natalie

Mish, why does this world bring in so much sadness and loneliness? :(
Can someone please tell me how the song in the background's called? I love it so much 😍

I love this video so real and honest, i'm still trying to be the person i wont to be, but sometimes i don't know what materrially do. I don't have a particular talent or a passion for nothing so for me is really difficult understand the right way to follow.
i love your hair it looks so cool!
My question is: When Im in a situation where I have choose/respond/act etc.. A question pops in my head(What would my fave celebrity do?)How do I become myself Michelle? How do I deal with this?
You are so mature
such a good speaker!
I have à question ! how do you start a beauty blog ? do you have any tips or things like that ?
Michelle, where did you get your shirt you're wearing in this video?
Good job Michelle! You helped people out, and now you get a mental highfive!^_^
Michelle plz reply to this comment xxxxx 
Where did u get your dreamer light from ??? Xx💞💞💞💞🦄
I was in a 4 year relationship that just ended. He isolated me so much that I don't really have any close friends to rely on. Now I'm just going to have to start over and stay strong <3
Bed all day bed all day
Deep and real Michelle!!! Thanks!
this is so true! it always calms me down to ace a winged eyeliner or create a cool, colourful eyeshadow look xxx
test
Where can I get that "dreamer" sign?
Zayn literally copied the title of this vid. Sue him.
Michelle I cut my hair and I'm a girl but loads of people call me a boy . how can I fix this issue that kills my self  confidence
Anyone who knows where her blouse is from?✌🏻️😁
what do you do if you get so mad because your friend copies you 24\7
💜💛💚💙 Thank you for so many years of consistently encouraging me just when I need it! Right now I'm feeling so much pressure in my career goals from the people around me, when I want to do something completely different. You're saying not to let others dictate my life, saying that making my own time makes me the universe making my own reality ... well, it is just what I needed to hear!
love you so much Mish you are such an inspiration and always make me want to better myself<3
Michelle, what do you personally think about bullying and standing up for yourself?
is she still with Dom?
is she still together with her boyfriend?!
u always inspire me. I really want to ask u about job. I'm feel lost bc I don't know what I really love to do and who I want to become...I feel like I'm wasting my time with the job I'm working for right now. It's just a job parents want me to do...
her face look so tired :(
mai mốt để phụ đề đi chị
wow... you should really be a therapist. you're voice is so calm and soft and you have wise words as well- someone should really make a book all about your quotes in it.. I will always love you Mish!
Did you and dom break up?
I can see her aura, slightly, but it's there for sure :o
Hi! First off I love your content. How does someone apply for a position to work for your social media team for ipsy? If you guys aren't currently hiring that's cool too but I'm just curious because doing something like that is my passion! Thanks Mish <3

hey! Michelle well i just wanna ask u that i wanna be a model & iam 16yrs ago & iam in 9th std i want to be a model now so can i be a model because  i dont want to continue my studies please reply its really important..
We are so grateful to have someone like you in our lives, Michelle. Authenticity just oozing from the screen in more forms than one is what drew me to you in the first place and I can only imagine how many others. I just want you to know that you are very much appreciated and thought of on a daily basis and it has truly been an honor to know you even if it is just a part or you. Love you, Mish <3 Stay gold and One love!
Hi, Michelle! I really appreciate how you give advice here in your segment pillow Talk. I'm just wondering about something. I just actually wanna know how you know if your friends already are toxic to your life? Thanks and I appreciate you reading this. More power!👍
These are so great 💕👌
I emailed to IPSY saying please do not send me nail polish. But they replied they could not. I think your company can set up personal dislike item into clients' account and avoid to send them.
Michelles videos are so pleasing for my eyes.
Where did you get that top???? So cute!!
Michelle, I have a question. How do I deal with my shyness and overcoming it? Love you.
Really? I thought you are a makeup/skin care YouTuber
Happy lunar new year Michelle! I hope you'll make a video you wearing AO DAI and sing a Vietnamese song.
I just love how positive she it as always
What ever happened to dom??
Great personality.
I really like really really like this type of videos!
i even get social anxiety when its only about texting ugh
Anyone know where i can Michelle's sweater
I love these videos
I love these videos
Michelle, I love this video and the fact that you take time to grow up with us as a person. Hope you don't dissapear from youtube. I want more of Mish. I love you.
I like that you're a cat.

great, now i need that lipstick too :/
Michelle why didn't you say you knew swoozie???
How do you deal with inner battles when you have a disorder.
Hey Mich, I love you. I have been following you ever since you start recording using your laptop only. I have a question. How do you cope with situations that brings you down, so down that you eventually stop doing what you love to do? How do you keep making videos when you no longer have the will power to do it?
nice advice
Dear Michelle !! 🙆🏻🤗❤️🙈I'm Casey ,hi ! I like drawing a lot since when I was 4 years old . But now I feel like my drawings are bad and this stopped me from drawing . Now I want to get back to it but how do I feel more comfortable with my drawing  and how do I built my confidence on drawing ? Thank you Michelle ! This is my first comment in your channel because I was always too shy . I love you ❤️
lol ur hair
Thanks for making this video Michelle! I feel that having someone who is by your side giving you advice and pushing you to be stronger and better each day is a plus. Unfortunately not everyone is lucky to have a positive person near them and that's when they slip and fall. With you making these positive videos and encouraging others will help those who need it most. Thanks for doing what you do. Xoxo
I miss her so much.
I ONLY CLICKED ON THIS BC PILLOWTALK WHAT IS THIASSSS (buy pillowtalk on itunes)
idk
I want another video of you and dom
Anyone else think she was gonna sing pillow talk?...no? Ok..😔😂😂
Be more responsible and use your position to get the right information and help out there... Your advice is for unicorns and dreamers and hold no truth about the pain and work it involves.... Instead of printing questions do ur research and offer where to get help, or if you ARE qualified, then offer your services, not just a sound bite that leaves people more frustrated because they do not comprehend or cannot how to get there .... 

Stick to your make-up and fairies and unicorns.  Extremely irresponsible and judgemental video.
Make  slime
Michelle, i have been watching you since you started YouTube. I just want you to know that you are a huge inspiration to me and are the reason I got into makeup. Also, I was just brutally dumped by someone I thought cared for me. Your videos are really helping me recover my mental strength. Thank you for everything you do, Mish.
Michel phan always help me
Excuse me I'm from Mexico and my English is not very good, so someone could tell what is social anxiety? Thanks!
❤️❤️❤️
I want that dreamer neon light thing so badly
I have severe social anxiety, or just anxiety in general and I haven't been able to go to school without really intense panic attacks and this actually calmed me knowing people have anxiety of what limits them and that there is actually more jobs and educational ways to get out there.
:'(
Please, we need a hair tutorial, i love the spikey fanned out hair at the back. I know you wont reply, but in case you do, im a new sub and it would be cool if you told me how you created the spikey hair at the back? <3
Where did you get that dreamer light?
Where is your mushroom pillow from? -
how do you find yourself?
How old do you have to be in order to be an ipsy care person? I'd love the job.
I love these
Please be my sister/friend.
Why do I constantly feel that people don't like me...?
Her videos are so calming and relaxing. Her voice is so soothing and this series is so inspiring, they always help me out. Watching her videos make me feel almost safe and happy (: love you Mish! 💗
lol u all girlz hahahhahahahhaha :)
What's the song that she always uses at the end of her video called?
Where did she get that mushroom pillow!?!?
I so agree about the part with the phone! It irritates me to see ppl in a relationship going trough their partners phone or always checking the on every social account. It also make me sad because that mean they don't trust each other. I meen why be in a relationship if you don't trust one and other. Trust is such an important thing in a relationship. to quote Marlon Wayens from the movie White Chicks "If we don't have trust, We have nothing" that quote has stayed by me ever since I've heard it. xD
I miss her...
I really really miss mich
what is the song in the beginning? really love it but there is no description, no comments. u.u
woman*
No one else said it so I'm going to say it but I would have died if you played Zayn's song in the background but loved the vid anyways.
Michelle Phan will you continue to make makeup tutorials like you used to? I used to watch your tutorials all the time but now it seems like weeks maybe months until you upload something. Miss your makeup tutorials.
Please help me in your next pillow talk video!! I'm 19 years old and I still don't know what to do on College. People keep asking me when I'm going to the university and I feel kinda under pressure for that. How can I deal with that and how do I figure out what I wanna do for living?
What if we wear something we really comfortable with. But it was not up to date at all, that if people see we are wearing it, they would like 'ew, she got no sense of fashion at all'
I have REALLY bad social anxiety
with the first question, i feel like that's really hard to do, especially when the "people around you" are your family. I want to do so many things but my mom doesn't think i should do them because it's not worthy. she doesn't like a lot of stuff i do. she's always the one telling me to think of what the other people would think of me if i do this or that. it's really tiring. and i don't think ill ever be able to escape from this. Also, there's no point in talking to her cause she's very close minded. doesn't listen to anyone but herself.
It doesnt really matter but im just curious whats her religion?cauz she has a beautiful mind and she must have been inspired by smthg or someone
this is comforting and helpful cause i have social anxiety, im trying to really over come it because i don't want to deal with it again when school starts.
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THAT MISH IS PREGNANT????
I am checking her videos after a year. Is she still with dom? ?
Where is her cute boyfriend ?
that hair mish im sorry 😂😂😂😂
What happened to the Em store?
So wise
PILLOWTALK-ZAYN.
yes, it quite bother me if my friends (not so close to me) ask me to lend my phone to them for some unknown reason. and they called me stingy just because i didn't lend it to them. well, i would say to my friend, "it's mine and it's my privacy, i won't borrow your phone when it's not in emergency time, so please do the same". i lend to them in emergency time, like when their phone battery is dead and they need to make a call or send a message to somebody. sometimes i lend my phone to my close friends, but they do something i hate, like write or posting something unpleasant in my social media. hey, that's my social media, not yours. even though it's just a joke, i don't like that kind of thing, because i never done that to my friend phone. why people, why?? :(((
is she still with her bf
if you,michelle are reading this. i just want you to know that you are so inspirational. i just love how you express things,because i cant. hope some day you will read my Q and then A it :D with loves of love and hopes XOXO
Grandma 👵👵👵👵👵👵👵
I feel like even though I don't even really know her that much but I totally trust her so much. I love Mish
Now everyone will associate this video series with that stupid song:(
Cool
michelle,what lip color were u wearin in this video?xx
Hey Michelle I am Gaurangi, Vikrant Urunkar's daughter. Well I have a question , how to get rid of laziness and get to ur goals!!!!!???😓😮😟
I don't think I have arrogance, but the thing is, people tell me how good I am, so if I say I'm not then I'm insecure, if I say thanks then I'm arrogant I don't understand, I find it difficult to take compliments, because I'm scared of being judged, i find it hard to make and keep friends because I have social anxiety, but on the outside I come across as the most confident girl in my year, any help? x
Hi Michelle, i know this is very personal to you, but, you talked about your family once in your "draw my life" video. So can you do it again, like an update to how they are doing? what are they doing? how are you keeping in touch and everything. Sorry if this request disturbs you in any way.
Hi Mish, I want to ask you how to let go stuff? Past, material things, failures and etc. Also how to be prepared to lose something you love? Bye I love you!
She helps other people from anxiety when she's the one having anxiety.
You're exactly right about our phones becoming like our diaries. If only some people will realize that and stop complaining about those who are always on their phones.
Pls do a Kylie Jenner makeup tutorial ! Moth of your lips are so similar and big !
How do you know if a boy likes you are not
Your voice is soooooo soothing!!😭😭😭❤❤❤❤ I can hear you voice the whole day❤❤❤
please come back with videos related to mental health and self love.....there are many people who needs some sort of inspiration,advice,motivation. Your voice is just love❤❤❤ 
It will surely help people like me!❤
Think about what you're thinking about 👌
Michelle i feel that u rly need to think back and try to soend more time to interact with ur friends rather than just chasing the success for ur career. Honestly, i feel that all the success that ur enjoying right now is because of ur fans love for you.
R u still with dom?
Ahh
Comeback Michelle 😔
I wrecked my whole year bcoz my boyfriend cheated on me..and grades were so horrible..and then I saw this video..u literally lifted me up..thank u so much..may god bless you..
I unsubcribed to ipsy. It's too much of a wait for me. That doesn't mean I don't love you Mish.
Hello Michelle, you probably don't know me, but, I have watched your videos from day one. I remember how I was your first subscriber, and now you have 8 freakin' millon!! I remember when your hair was black, or when you posted your first video. Let me just say, its been amazing watching your progress. You have your own makeup line, you were on the cover of Forbes magazine, i'm just so glad to be subscribed to you. I am SO proud of how far you've come Michelle. Truly.  You are so inspiring. Taking the time to sit down and talk with your viewers about life's problems is wonderful, you make mw prouder with everything you do. Hopefully you can take the time to read this. Good luck Mish.
What is the difference between shaming and constructive criticism?
Sorry to be rude but can you please make a Katherine pierce makeup tutorial from the vampire diaries if you haven't heard it its on Netflix Stefan is my boyfriend I just don't know when we'll meet anyway yeah please
Michelle, a few weeks ago, at a school dance, I was rejected by my crush. I have known him for 6 years, and everyone is telling me to let go, but I can't. Now, I just have been depressed, miserable, and have felt like nothing. It's hard when someone you have loved and known for so long just stabs you in the back. His now girlfriend was asked if they were still dating, and she said no. He doesn't know any of this. I still like him, we're still friends, but I still wish that night ended differently. Can you give me some advice?   +Michelle Phan
I think it's really remarkable that Mish takes the time to respond and interact with her fans. She's so down to earth, and it makes me smile to see her username threaded into the comment section☺️
I looove your hair!
do more makeup tutorials ~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
having severe chronic illness i struggle ALL THE TIME with comparing myself with other people and trying to view myself through other peoples' eyes but i have really been working hard and i have found the key to it is just not to make those comparisons in the first place. don't even think about what other people are doing or thinking and ignore how they might react to what you're doing  - and if you find your mind starting to slip off in that direction, go PHYSICALLY DO SOMETHING to get your mind off that altogether so you can focus on yourself. always remember even if you're the most popular person in the world, at the end of the day the only person you have (necessarily) is yourself.
Is she working at ipsy?
I dont agree with her about the phone thing. I think if youre in a relationship with someone youre a big part of eachothers lives and there shouldnt be a reason for you not to want your sig. other to see things on your phone. And if theres something on there that would cause the other person to break up with you, then you obviously shouldnt be together in the first place.
i wanna start youtube but my mom and dad its dangerous. Please help
I have popular people at my school. I have to deal with them I don't know how to make myself feel happy when all they do is talk about my looks or my shoes or why i'm not savage. A peer of mine once changed to become noticed and it was not how she used to be. She changed for others.
I find the amount of wisdom you have amazing. I think you have been given wisdom to touch all of our lives. thank you! love you :)
I love the advice in this, has really helped me!

I love u Michelle!!!!! Ur amazing!! So calm and kind  of relaxing listening to u.😊😊 but I would like to see more makeup tutorials and trend repots and monthly faves.LOVE U😊😁😊😀💄💄👖👗👟
Hi Mish! I'm very young and you inspire me so much! You are just like my big sister I never had. You taught me how to live my life to the fullest and express myself through makeup. You taught me how to show my completely other side that no one has seen through makeup. You brought me to where I am today. I love u! xo,     Emma.
Michelle! could you please tell me where have you bought this shirt? Thank u.
Cute hair. Looks like Elsa mixed with Phobe Buffay.
What do you do when your friends ignore you?
i hope you see my comments.the fisrt thing i want to talk with you that iam a big fan of you.i come from vietnam so english just a second languages.sometime i can understand all of what you say so i hope you add ensup for your video.i really really love your voice .i download your video just because i want to listen your voice and copy to improve speaking skill.love you Michelle
You are my definition of confidence, beauty, and love. You were my first inspiration and you will always be. I NEVER  get tired of watching you, simply because I am learning and enjoying. You help me through questions I have for myself and teach me new things I end up loving. I will never forget you, Michelle. I love you for who you are and I hope to carry the things you teach me into my future. 💗💗
So basically be more selfish. Be more self centered.
❤💛💜💙💚 you! 😇
Anyone who can tell me what lipstick that is? :)
Nice video!
br
Hey guys, I just uploaded my first video and would be very happy about some feedbacks! Thanks a lot! xoxo, Myla :)
Hey Michelle! I really need help with something thats been bothering me for a while. I have 2 groups of friends, but a couple best friends in each group. I don't feel like I belong in either of these groups. I dont know if I just focus on the bad side. But i really dont feel wanted. When the first group of friends make plans and I cant go they make a reeaaallly huge deal out of it. Like even when im depressed and cant go they think im a buzzkill. And the second group is soooo boring. They both have the goods and the bads but i cant focus on the good from how much the bad is bothering me. This was very confusing I know 😂 please help me, whats your advice? I love youuu 💜💜
yehey
Hi Mish, I don't know if you're taking questions on here, but I'm just going to write one for the next pillow talk. I live with my mom, sister, brother, and my grandma comes over a lot. My mom's side of the family talks bad about my dad all the time. Me and my mom also argue a lot. It's come to the point where I think about suicidal things. I want to know how to deal with this much negative in my house almost 24/7.
Michelle! Can you in your next pillow talk, talk about dealing with the loss of an animal or someone very close. My cat was attacked and killed by a dog the 20th of february. She was gone for a long time before our neighbor told us that their dog had killed a cat that looked just like Fia (my cat). I am very sad. I loved her SO SO much! I would like to get some advice on how to deal with this, cuz i really need it.
You're like a big sister to me, I really love your pillow talk videos. You always give great advice :) x
I love how real you are. I really appreciate that💕 You're so YOU!
You're a wonderful person! ❤️
your opinion on constructive criticism was so relatable for me! i was always taking it as an offence .. thanks for showing the positive impact such criticism can have on me. Love you Michelle! keep growin'!! 😘😘
Mich is full of compassion and uderstanding. I am constantly amazed by her wisdom and eloquence. Such  a beautiful person inside and out.
I JUST GOT BACK FROM SCHOOL AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS AND I LOVED IT
i love ur set upmand everything  but can u do a hair and makeup tutorial  plz thnx mish
Love you Michelle! So smart and generous
Michelle, what kind of hairstyle did you do for this video? And what color lipstick are you wearing it's beautiful on you!!?
I see that phone issue a little different... I can tell that me and my boyfriend never have a problem if the significant other wants to have a look on it. I'll be like: yeah sure here you have it.. And same goes for him. We have no secrets and we both accept what we are and that's why there is no hiding.
Luv you mish <333
Where is the sweater from?
My biggest problem is not having friends... Not even one single close friends.. :(
it's all about details-i love how she is reading from paper and not scrolling through her phone which can distract so much or even annoy.i think it's important.maybe it's because i challenged myself to go through a month without my phone lol!
I love you soo much❤️❤️💖💖
Its kind of ironic about the phone thing because I thought the exact same way. I have to trust my boyfriend because his phone is his privacy just like my phone is  my privacy yet if he asked to look at my phone, I honestly have nothing to hide. BUT why I say its ironic is the fact that when he was with me, he was actually talking to another girl. Later on he left me for this girl. The feeling of betrayal isn't enough to explain how much I felt, but its all a learning experience. And yes, it will take time. I'm still trying to get over it -Soka
I like her room
teachers in my school are always pointing out how confident I am to be myself everyday to wear black lipstick and have pink hair and just not look like every other girl in the school
Zayn
+Michelle Phan can you do karai makeup tutorial from Nickelodeon teenage mutant ninja turtles . I know karai is gonna be your favorite character she is a kunoichi bad guy :)
Please show us more of that room I love it
Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us. You are like a breath of fresh air. Xoxo 💗
I really really appreciate this series. These videos are very helpful and you are so wise! Thank you so much!!
you should do a hair tutorial im really curious on that style id love to see how you did it. thank you so much for your good advice i love you
ohhh darling I think @harrysfavorite means harry styles :D xx
Your videos are always so relaxing
YAAAY!! Excited to see a new video on this friday. Feeling under the weather today, so this helps :)
Love these so much! ❤️ Don't listen to all the people who complain, you do you! ^-^
Michelle, you're brilliant and a true role model
<3 you lots, Michelle! :-)
"It's so key" my new phrase
I love these pillowtalks I take so much from them makes me feel like I am talking to my sister
I have this friend who is amazing, but she thinks to highly of herself. I don't want to tell her because I'm worried it will ruin our friendship, but it's starting to get to me.  She's always discouraging me whenever I give a suggestion.  She wasn't always like this. She's always trying to get involved in people's personal issues.  She used to be my enemies best friend, and I'm worried that if I tell her she'll go and tell my enemy all my secrets and ruin my life.  Everyone thinks she really nice, but she's passive aggressive. I don't know what to do. What do you think I should do?
Love u mish! <3
❤
I love youuuuu
She’s so beautiful and inspiring!! She was called to share her story! Her story is real and authentic and she’s never changed a bit! So beautiful and humble
I hate Michelle, she is such a hypocrite.
I have this friend who knows my password to my phone and I always catch her snooping through my messages and it makes me furious because I don't do that . If I try to do that to her , she freaks out and argues with me,
How to make that dreamer led El behide uh.. Please make a video of it.
I really love your outfit where are the pieces from? you look gorgeous:) <3
"Whenever your bone is broken, when it heals, it becomes stronger" such a great line Mish xxx
I love the way you think about things, you put everything into perspective with your wisdom. ♡♡
loving your hairstyles! please do tutorials
Thank you for doing this series
this was great! So sincere and insightful as always!
I'm so the same way when it comes to social events/ gatherings. Observing before engaging is smart. Some people see it as stand-offish when that's not the case.
A person I used to call my best friend just last week backstabbed me and is currently still making fun of me and spreading rumors all for a guy who is cheating on her. 
I can't believe I then see you make a video of betrayal. I can't express how much this helped me and how relevant it is. Thank you so much Mish. 
You're always here for me. From way back in 2006 when I was trying to understand eyeliner, to now when I'm trying to figure out who are my true friends and who aren't. 
I'll always love and support you <3
I respected you as a creative makeup artist and I respect you so much more as a person after watching this video. Thank you for your experiences and sharing them! Truly enjoyed and gained insight from this video  :)
Michelle, I love your videos so much. I love how inspiring and helpful you are; but your also so BEAUTIFUL! I don't know if you will read this but I just want you to know how amazing you really are. Anyone who agrees then like if you agree 👍😚
I soooo love your videos Mish! you are such an inspiration to us... thank you! 😘😄😊
"When you're waiting for something to happen, you're on the universes' time. But if you're the one creating something, now you're your own universe creating your own reality." This line stuck to the me the most. Thank you so much Michelle. You are honestly such an amazing and inspiring person.
Hi Michelle Phan can you please film a makeup tutorial for lunar new year 2016? <3
Dear michelle, you don't know ow much these videos mean to me. You brighten up my life, you are so true and accepting. I love how you just do your thing and don't care what others think. I love you. 
P.S. I know your're reading this because you love you fans too much to not.
U.U awe it's so cute
I looove these videos! x
I really love her
Michelle :-)
At a point in one of you former videos you told us to just do what we love in life and to stop thinking about what others think about us and to do whatever we feel is right for us, but what if who you're marrying or what career path you choose goes against what your family wants for you and/or religion? Then what should we do? For example you want to have a career in acting but only a select few succeed in that career path. Michelle I love you and your videos are extremely inspiring  and I just hope you'll see this comment so that I can get some feedback😘
Michelle, what happened to your views? did YT do the mobile views thingy to you too??
Great video Michelle :) Love your background btw, so cute!
Mish you should do a podcast with pillow talk. I love listening to your voice and your advice :)
PILLOW TALK IS NOW AVAILABLE ON ITUNES
I love that you are a young woman who is smart, beautiful , strong , confident and giving. And still maintain a down to earth relationship with your subbies. 
Great "pillow talk" Michelle. And listening is an awesome skill set to have  in a social situation. Thanks. 😊❤️
Thank you so much for this video. They help a lot love you 💕
I love your hair, do a tutorial 💙 ps: I love this video, it helped so much

I admire all of your videos and you I would love to see more Diy videos or what to wear!love you!❤️
I could easily listen to you and your advice for an hour.
Come on everyone , Michelle knows what she wants and she would never give up on her tutorials!! The last time she did a make up tutorial was two weeks ago...
When I first found out about zayns new song I thought of you lol
SUE ZAYN MALIK!!!!!!
More cool gift ideas and cute trendy tech update videos please <3
Love this video, love you!
Who else would love to see an everyday makeup video from Mish?
Background music??
This video was beyond perfect, and exactly what I needed to hear. I have been feeling down on myself lately, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I do care about what people think too much. Writing is one of my most favorite things to do, and what you said about putting your negative energy down on paper makes so much sense. The only time I wanted to write was when I was feeling good. Thank you for this, Michelle. 💜💜
great post
Can you do a tutorial on how to apply makeup to another person. I have a lot of friends who want me to do their makeup but it's hard! Love your variety of videos!
Hi guys, I'm her new fan. Can anybody tell me how to send her my questions like this video? Thanks in advance. <3
Amazing as usual!!!! Love you Mish!
it's really important to have the satisfaction about who you are by loving your rules, your thinking and your Inner essence, and once you do so that will reflect positively on your attitude and your personality and will build up your confidence so what people think about you will be significantly less important to you.
love yourself and be who you are!! 
 with love <3  and thank you MISH !
PILLOWTALK

RECK-A-LESS BEHAVIAAAAAH
Love u mish💞💞💞💞
My boyfriend and I were talking about you a couple of days ago after I read your little section in Forbe's 30 under 30 issue and we have come to the conclusion that you're the coolest, most humble, most successful, and most inspiring person we know. Keep doing what you're doing, Michelle!
Zayn malik
Michelle, I recently broke up friendship with my best friend and I was crying that whole day because she told me she never liked talking to me and now I see negatives everywhere in me I don't know what do I see all my negatives and can look at myself on the positive side I keep making myself think about bad stuff and I don't want to I can't focus on anything I have exam week soon and I can't concentrate and I always think really bad about myself now and I just can't stop
What have you been told that is offensive by a guy that they don't think is offensive to the female gender?
How are you and Dom doing? 😊 please make a video with him again
Ohh I'm always so exited when your pillow talks come out. I love them👍
great advice.. i love everything about this video.
I love Michelles' pillow talks (and all her other videos) , she actually knows what she's talking about unlike other youtubers that have no idea what they're doing
Michelle is going to be the best mom ever
I want to work in ipsy🙏
Can we get a tutorial on this hairstyle? I love it so much! 
And of course the video was awesome ;)
love having this serious talk with you. <3
Thank you for addressing social anxiety.  It feels so great for me to hear people talk about it as something valid, when I've been told all my life just to get over it.  Michelle, you are such a gem!
wise lady!
"i wonder who harry is"  ...
I have terrible social anxiety... I've had to get home schooled because it got so severe. I really don't know how I am going to make it getting a job when I can't even make it to "real" school...
Did you create ipsy?🤔
Did you create ipsy?🤔
can't stop staring at the mario shroom <3
I need that mushroom pillow like right now!
I found this pillow talk like 100x amazing (I mean they always are) but these topics were especially good. I loved what you said about constructive criticism bc I feel like I tangle them or better yet associate it with bullying sometimes since I tend to take comments sometimes too personal. I think it  has to do a lot with how I was bullying as a kid and how I never want to feel judged, unimportant, or inferior again by someone else.  But this brought me to understand now that I am older that this is necessary and so far off from bullying but actually a good thing for me to have, so that it can push me and help me have that mentality of becoming a better person everyday.          Thank you mish♥♥
Omg when I was 8 years old I watched ur barber tutorial that was made in 2009 and I only used to watch that 5 years later I come across ur updated YouTube channel and I have fallen in love with it ur different to compared to other you tubers and ur far from this sophisticated typical world it’s amazing!♥️♥️♥️♥️
I never leave the house, I'm so scared of everyone and everything and the only reason I leave is for school and work but I hate them because my friends find me annoying as I'm so dependant and afraid of lower and older years
I really dislike this new age spiritual outlook she's promoting. 5 years ago mish was never like this. She took all of her character & replaced it for some waked out way of thinking. He's an awesome makeup artist & she's beautiful & is talented but if you think about it this is not the mish we knew 5 years ago.
You need a channel on XM radio so I can always listen to you! My hour long drive to school each way would be so much more calming if I were listening to a pillow talk. haha Love ya, girl!
I just  love you mich, I think you should right a book. You're not just a beauty guru but a wonderful and a deep person. Looking forward for your next pillow talk ❣
I could listen to you talk all day... Please make more of these!
omg ur such a good role model💗
Pillow talk videos are my absolute faves! I always feel like we are legit best friends just chilling & having a conversation. ❤❤
amica, tu sì che mi capisci!!!❤
I love your pillowtalk videos so much!! I feel like we're really sitting in the same room and my friend is giving me advice💕
love you michelle <3 enjoyed this pillow talk for my morning :) enjoy your day mish!!! xD
thanks Michelle it was much needed for me as i m going through a lot of things be it some work of just feeling m doing so much which is exciting but also gives me anxiety
Waiting for zayn to pop up in the video 😂
Anyone else think Michelle's voice is so soothing and calming? Like I love hearing her voice. 💓💓
Where do you buy your clothes? They are so gorgeous! And how do you do your braids? Love them all since the Best of 2015 video! 
Love you Mish ♥
I will have to start reflecting on my days now! That's a good idea. Whether it's a good or bad day. And you're also right, feedback or constructive criticism is always one of the best things you can get.
Mich is and will always be my inspiration always. I love these series so much, Michelle has created so much and also gives so much. I hope I will be a amazing human as mish, and I can't wait for her new manga!!!
The bed looks sooo cozy 😍
omf u called one vid "Netflix and chill" and this "pillow talk" so.. I kinda think this can lead to misunderstandings
I wonder who Harry is😂😂😂😂
loved the video!!!
please come back...we really need you :(((( i missed you michelle so much :((((
What are her beliefs? Like religion? 
I love pillow talks :) They help me a lot!
You're so inspirational gurl! Thanks for putting this out...❤️
Love that lavender background , and how calm your voice sounds:)
my heart exploded seeing you posted a new video 😍
hey mishmish :) thats mean a peach in Arabic :D
  I love drawing,
But I don't know how to make my dream come true :'( ...
I love these videos Mish, they're so calming and relaxing and you give really good advice too ^.^ xo
love you mish, i've been subscribed to you for a long time now but lately when i see your thumb i don't feel as enthusiastic as years before but nevertheless i click  becoz i just do and you always surprise me with your content. i'm in a funk for a while now, and hearing your words are so comforting coz you are always so kind and compassionate. thank you so much for making these, you're helping a lot of people. ❤️
i loved this xx (the title made me think of zayns song lol)
I REALLY love when you do these 💜
your videos calm me when I have a bad day. you're such an inspiration.
I love this series!!! You're so positive, it's contagious!! Thank you for this..❤️

Any YouTubers want to support each other?
Thank u for sharing more of your wisdom. : )
Your room is so pretty
I love you 😘😘😘 Mish ❤️❤️
I love these videos :)
I'm growing to love you so much, your whole aura is just endearing. Hopefully I'll ask a question for the next pillow talk, I'd love your advice on something thats bugging me
who thought of zayn malik's. new music vedio??
Now overtime i see the word pillow talk i start singing... just me?
what the hell u r so prettyyy
love you😘😘😘😘
She is wearing French braids, not cornrows. She is not appropriating any culture. I could see if she was wearing cornrows or box braids but she's wearing basic pig tails. Chill out guys it's just a makeup tutorial
Anyone else miss these types of videos 😭
any race can wear any hairstyle. it's hair.
Her voice is so like.. mother nature.. haha its so weird but yet satisfying lol
Michelle focuses on the care of the skin underneath the makeup rather than piling a bunch of makeup on. She's awesome 😌
I wish this included a hair tutorial :(
Is it weird that I watch this video at least once a month
i'm still confused why people attacked her for the original name of this tutorial and braids but didn't attack the other dozen gurus here on youtube who did baddie looks and wore these same braids. y'all just looking to attack anybody who will pay attention
Michelle we miss you!!!  :(
I'm black and I love this tutorial and the previous title. Why must we always create drama over little things? All Michelle did was do her makeup and hair. What's the problem?
smhhhhh her skin is so good she didn't even use any foundation meanwhile i'm over here lookin like an oaf even with way more makeup
She needs to make more makeup tutorials. It's been almost a year. I miss her videos, but I know she's got a lot of stuff going on
This is my ultimate favorite look on her. She looks so fierce!!
I don't LOVE Michelle, but I've always respected her for understanding that simple make-up is the best kind. Contouring, 'fleeking', filling-in, baking, beating, WHATEVER all look terrible in the light of day and are more like special effects make-up than everyday looks. Michelle has never been one of those girls and I love that. I can't wait til those fads die...
Lol, I miss this kind of makeup then today's makeup 😩😔
I dont see the cultural appropriation?
I can understand if it were cornrows or dreads but these are dutch braids, or a different version of french braids. French braids originated from Greek and Celtic culture. I know this video was called lowkey baddie but why are people upset about it? Dutch braids and cornrows are both variations of the french braid. Cornrows are defined to be braids tightly wound around the scalp, and in multiple separate braids, which Michelle clearly doesn't have. So why is this video getting so much hate?
do the 12 Zodiacs looks Michelle, or 12 Chinese Zodiacs looks good be cool too
I am so in love with this look and gosh your nails
i'm too poor for this
I'll take Michelle Phan over Carli bybel any day
Oml you guys are so stupid. She's not even wearing cornrows or anything like that! The only way she could be appropriating any hairstlye is to act as if she made the hairstyle up and gave it a different name. Plus, she's wearing pigtails and almost everyone wore that hairstyle. And also, no certain culture is tied down to a hairstyle, yeah maybe they were one of the first to wear that hairstyle but its not theirs!
What is the background music called? I love it so much!!
I really like this look because it's simple and you can actually try it out. most makeup looks are getting a bit weird. of course it depends on what look you like the best, heavy or light, crazy or simple, I won't judge. but for me I HATE the makeup trends these days. Too much weird liquid lipstick colors, bake bake bake face.. It's really not my type. I wish people now stop caking their faces to make themselves "unique" but I'd rather want a look thats more of enhancing(?) their natural beauty instead of a crazy-ish trendy look. But if you like those looks then good for you! But nowadays as I just said, I wish people could stop trying to get attention with the weirdest colors they could find and blab it all their faces and people being like "SLAYY OMG LOVE THAT LOOKKK". I mean I dont care if you like it but i get a feeling they don't but just trying to.. meh its just my opinion. But anyways... Love the look!:)
There are some things that are cultural appropriation,  like wearing a native american headress or a bindi. But im pretty sure wearing braids and a nude matte lip isnt culturally appropriating.
Why I felt so magical when I watched her video LOL ^_^
Tbh, Michelle Phan is better at makeup tutorials than all the other beauty gurus on Instagram and some on youtube. Beauty gurus nowadays are putting too much makeup on. And by that I mean like too much foundation or too much concealer. Like chill! Just like what Michelle said. "A little goes a long way." 
I'm sure there are other gurus that don't use too much makeup either but I happen to notice Michelle very often. I've always been a viewer of Michelle fan since I was in the 6th grade. I'm now going into my junior year of high school and I still love to watch her videos. But it's occasionally because of course, I've been real busy with school and hanging out with friends.
girl come back!
Has anyone noticed some of her old videos were deleted? Or is it just me?
Im arabic and before my great grandma was born, people were braiding their hair every single day AND ITS NOT RACISM AND IF MY BRAID OFFEND U THEN HAHAHA IDC
Could her skin be less perfect? K thanks.
wow she's so pretty and beautiful!
Who is watching in 2018??
If you think braids are cultural appropriation, you obviously have no true knowledge of what it means to appropriate something, rather than appreciate a hairstyle.
I literally just read everything in the comment section and I couldn't find the racist comments. I'm missing out.
it's crazy I remember her home facial remedies in her early years it's amazing how far she's come
Her hair is fine. Cultural appropriation is about how the original people who wore something from their culture are being bashed for it, while others wear those same things and are praised for looking trendy without understanding the cultural significance of it. 

Stuff like cornrows are a sensitive topic, because many black women are bashed by white women and black men and white men alike, being called ratchet or ghetto for wearing the hair. 

That's also why many black women wear weaves, because their hair is "bad hair". 

The history of black women bashing is long. Please don't dismiss other experiences because you are too uncomfortable to acknowledge it or because you haven't experienced it.
Who else loves her voice? Is like her voice is so soothing.
I could listen to you talk all day Michelle it's so soothing lol <3
People are calling these dutch braids appropriative, and I'm not trying to make light of cultural appropriation. But these are Dutch braids. DUTCH braids. They are literally called DUTCH braids. My mom is white as hell and she used to wear them to school every day as a kid in the 50s. This particular style is not a hairstyle any one culture has any particular claim on.
This was her last tutorial and so many people were so rude to her. Now we're stuck with actual racists as YouTube MUAs.
I can't believe how beautiful she is... is she even real... how can a human being be this beautiful...
Its 12:01... January 22, 2017..... Exactly a year since she uploaded a makeup tutorial.
How does Michelle make everything look so easy and perfect
Is she still dating the same guy? They should do a Harley Quin x Joker makeup tutorial. HE WOULD BE A PERFECT JOKER PLEASE!
I miss Michelle Phan
Hahaha i think its pretty funny how i read a positive comment that is against all the negative ones and after that i really just wanna read a negative one but when i scroll down i only see positive ones n ill be like ohh cmon why all the positive cover up the negative already
Sometimes when I watch Michelle's videos I get tears in my eyes because it feels like a huge part of my childhood is just gone
I miss your makeup tutorials Michelle.. ♡♡♡
Background music name please?
I don't often do my makeup as it is time consuming, but when I do, you are how I learned I the first place. Thanks!!
what is the background music called
It's really sad how some people react to a simple movement or style choice. The fact that she had her hair in FRENCH braids and used the words 'low-key baddy', and was judged is very sad. If people make comments before looking into the subject and are blinded by their own pride, they end up looking stupid. And even if she was copying a certain culture, those people should take it as a compliment. They should not go after her with rude names, and false accusations. Michelle looked gorgeous in this video (as she always does), and I hope that the ignorant comments of some people didn't make her change the title. She should be able to express herself in any way she wishes without being ridiculed.
Her lip bleeding. Ouch. Hate when that happens to me.
is she still dating dom?
how the hell are these cornrows? they're two dutch braids lmao
Those braids are sexy as hell on you. Gorgeous
I tried this look and I kid you not, its as if i transformed. I got SO many compliments compared to when i do a heavy makeup tutorial with harsh contour/highlight/dramatic eyes. Honestly Michelle is OG of makeup hope she makes a comeback with more of her magic!!!
She does makeup is a simple way but perfect makeup...🤗😘😊
That lip color tho !!!
damn maybe i can pull off the lowkey baddie lol
Omg you're using Jeffree Star liquid lipstick <3 <3 <3
But I mean.. These are Dutch braids. I've seen these everywhere. EVERYWHERE. Pony clubs especially. Classic look. The logic in this comment section is basically first come first serve. Whoever invented the look first, it is exclusive to them and only them (their race/culture). It is believed that Egyptians were the first to use cosmetics so the logic is that it should be for them and only them. 

America is just getting too defensive right now. Over-sensitivity will be your country's downfall.
when she said tokyo i
remembered rhett 
"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT" 
gmm anyone?
omg cultures ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE wear braids, so unless its specifically locs or dreads, you cant really call this cultural appropriation. 
really loved this vid mish, its so so simple and can be worn day to day or even dressed up <3 im so sorry that you have to deal with all this hate
I love all her makeup tutorials but I cant recreate them cause my eyelids hide all of the eyeshadow and liner...ugh
This look reminds me of BlackPink - Jennie 💕
I miss these kind of videos tbh..
I am still wondering why Michelle stopped uploading videos and stop using some her social media accounts. Even her make-up line. I'm glad she come back and introduced again her make-up line. And... How's Dom?
This look  looks like it's straight out of the 90's.
does anyone know the song in the beggining?
Who else is so ready for Michelle to come back?
Damn, I remember the days when I used to sit an watch Michelle's videos for hours on end. I miss her so much.
I love this look!! I just did it, and I look stunning! ❤
Does someone know the background song?
I can't believe how much I miss watching your videos 😭
I remember when this was the most controversial thing on YouTube
This was uploaded a year ago today.
Came here from Lowkey Dad by Rhett and Link :)
this would eternally be my favorite video and makeup look
Why isn't she making makeup tutorials anymore? :(
Her last makeup look since January :(
MICHELLE'S VOICE IS LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL.. It can make me buy anything 😍
I miss your tutorials💜
youtube still recommends me michelle phan's videos, for me shes still the OG. soothing voice not those other gurus with quacking voice. hahaha
I love her nails!!! are they acrylics or something they are AMAZING!!!!💓💖💓
I'm blasian and all her looks suit my rounder face, similar nose, and small eyes so well! Thanks Michelle
That Sailor Moon powder got me like!!!! <33 SO GORG!
I miss your makeup tutorials! 😭
i miss your make up tutorials so much.. ❤❤❤💔
I bought and put on Jeffree Stars posh spice and I looked like my soul was taken out of me. My lips were dull gray and they looked so bad unlike how it looked like on Mich! 😭
The good ol' days when makeup was simple
After reading some comments, I'm left sitting here wondering why I'm not allowed to have baby hairs because I'm white.  ¯\(ツ)/¯
It helps to have eyelash primer that is just barely dry from tacky, because it holds the curl so well. Then add mascara. xo
What's the background song called? It's so relaxing
Did anyone notice this is the only makeup tutorial she made this year? I'm not complaining, it's just kinda funny.
OMG!!! I absolutely love this video of you, it hi-lights your beauty so well in such a simple/eclectic look!! thanks Michelle
"Anyone with all ages" IM TELLING MY MOM :D
We miss your makeup tutorials Michelle! Hope to see another soon hope you are well. 😚
I sometimes find myself going to your videos just to hear your voice. Miss you, Michelle.
whats the song in this video?
Omg who else agrees that she is literally FLAWLESSSS
i respect michelle so much, shes a great role model for women...basically the pioneer of this youtube beauty guru phenomenon AND she didnt take her success for granted, instead took major risks with her money and invested it all for her business...shes now beyond just a internet star but a business mogul which majority of people cant achieve...shes a living proof that you can love makeup AND be a smart badass, and that just because you like taking care of your appearance doesnt mean you're some sort of ditzy brainless chick
michelle is my aesthetic. happy new year!
whats the song in the ending???
I miss your tutorials. It's not all about caking on layers of makeup and tons of setting sprays.
Michelle cant really be a baddie tbh, shes too cute for that
Hun your lip was bleeding for a sec you ok but btw YOUR MAKEUP WAS ON POINT LIKE DAMNNNNN😩🙌😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Made two days before my birthday. Ultimate aquarius look.
I’m watching again in 2019 and i just realized that she used a jeffree star liquid lipstick OMG 😭😂 i didnt know jeffree star back then when I first watched her video lol
plz post more makeup i really sad you stopped
You are gorgeous 😻
I am literally seeing more comments about not judging about the braids but there is probably very Little People trashing on Michelle's braids then people saying not to judge. So really don't see the point of people pointing out racist people because are no one is really caring about the braids and how they go for different ethnicities.
Who has spots on the sides of their nose they’re unlucky............but hey so am I 😁
old do more tutorials
You are beautiful as always ^ ^ keep it up!
Who else kept staring at her bleeding lip
i love the fact that i can come on MIchelle's channel and suddenly eel so beautiful and confident 💕
Oh God Michelle I miss watching your makeup tutorials. You are my first beauty guru and the reason why I am confident in trying makeup.
Her skin is perfect. It's got the perfect amount of "imperfections" :)
IF ONLY I WAS A GREAT MAKEUP MASTER LIKE YOU! DX
Amazing I love the nails And Makeup and Hair Slay 😚
are you and your bf still together?
God, I can fall asleep to her voice.
Oh my god you're so pretty. WHY AM I SUCH A FAT OSTRICH?????
You have perfect skin, please do a skincare routine
IDK if this is weird to say but your voice makes me fall asleep 😂
background music??
I thinked that the thumbnail was about a Lara Croft makeup transformation 😂
Soo, I'm white.. I have baby hairs... I like to wear a Dutch braid because it gets my hair out of my face... So, I'm now I a racist? What? That does not make any sense..
Michelle !!!! I miss your makeup videos <3333 stay strong !!
Girl you are amazing ❤️ So much hating down but girl 😍😍😍🔥🔥❤️❤️

Your voice is so calming and relaxing~~~
I know I am a nobody now, but when I am a somebody, This is my future wife💏💪💯. I need her. love at first sight.
lol the add popped up for how to shop Michelle's fav makeup products from her tutorials
Can we all just get over with the braids thing? Be mature and realize that people, in whatever tradition or culture wears braids. Right now it is a sign of self expression and showing how much one culture, can impact another. I wear braids (like Michelle's) and I wear because I look good and I feel good about myself.
 Is there something wrong rocking a braid that boost your confidence?
No. There is nothing wrong and it is absolutely okay.
Ahh her voice is so calming I'm so addicted !
anyone watching this in 2017?
I love you Michelle, your simplicity, & how you care for skin and yourself <3 xox gorgeous.
ur voice is so calming, i almost feel asleep lol. ❤

I am not hating girl i love you im just saying i feel like the lipstick is not really your colour...? To me its a little to light and grayish for you i think this look would look so much better with a different lip colour. Again, not hating.

This look would be so cute for graduation

Holy McNuggets I'm early
THIS. IS. ODDLY. PLEASING 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
im melissa. i love this video! your so pretty mish! im 11 years old and your  videos are increadible c:
OMG Michelle is an BTS ARMY OMG SOO COOL 

I MISS YA MICHELLE I MISS YOU SOO MUCH
I really miss Michelle Phan's makeup tutorials. I am not much of an Instagram makeup kinda person so I like how lowkey, simple and relatable Mish's makeup tutorials are. Love you Mish! <3
as a half Asian, I totally understand Michelle 💜 I grew up in an extremely diverse community where everyone would look different but give and take from other cultures. it's the beauty in beauty! 💕
My face just doesn't suit the full on baddie look and I've always tried to tune down the intensity of the tutorials I watched and suddenly something tells me Michelle did something wearable and it's what I've always wanted xx mish you've slayed me since 2011
2018 aNyOnE ?!?
Last makeup Tutorial was this.... It's been 6months 💔💔💔💔
I love how she only wears what she needs so instead of caking on foundation when she doesn't need it she use a bit of concealer
Is it weird this is my favorite makeup tutorial you've ever done? It is just so simple and pretty! Love you Mish! 💕💕
When is she going to make another one : )
What effect do you use at the beginning?
Michelle is also the one who do not put too much makeup on his face. Just fresh and not transforming too much the real natural beauty of her. 💕
You're skin is clearer than my future LOL what do you use??
this video is one of my favourite videos Michelle.I love her hair and her nails on this video❤😍
Your skin is so clear <3 <3
I love this look so much, it is exactly what i want for me right now. From the nails, to the hair, to the lips, it is PERFECT. I hope she makes more tutorials soon! :)
There is something special about this look.. idk what it is but its definitely my favourite one ever. It's so simple but so.. i dont know, mysterious or something like that. I absolutely adore it.
Your editing is seriously amazing! and those lashes look really nice and natural.
Hi Michelle You are amazing and I am Vietnamese I was born in Hawaii
Can u do a Braid tutorial
She's a high-key baddie! Always been one✌️😎😘
jessica alba indeed!
michelle PHAN
I tried this look and it looks okay😂
I miss Michelle and these videos so much!😭❤️
Did Anybody noticed that she didn't apply foundation!!
"Lowkey baddie" = "Sort of Urban" 😂 but cute though.
I really wanna do this makeup tutorial
what if I told you that those where French braids.
Love you Michelle from Romania! muah you re so sweet and good in what you do, plus you give me the girlpower and strentgth to follow my dreams
=^ • I • ^=
YOU SAID LOWKEY IM SCREAMING
Man French braids can be worn by anybody it's not for a specific culture
Can you do a video on periods
You reminded me of Beyonce with this look
oh plz. u can never be like. cashmere girls. rhey are way more beautiful. a big boooo for this tutorial 👎
Your pretty
Thank you for finding the perfect lashes for Asian eyes! I've been trying to find a good one for so long!
Swatch the Kylie lip kits!
Clean make up ❤
Looks flawless with just 3 dots of concealer, and some powder? Nope I would still look like an Orangutan!! lol
I really like this look been fan of michelle since she just started :)
love itt, I miss u so much
I love how she's so natural😍❤️.
She is wearing Dutch braids,not cornrows
ITS NOT CULTURAL APPROPRIATION
Is it just me or is anyone else loving Michelle's hair in this video? 😍
Can we all agree that Michelle phans glo up was magical??
me encantan tus videos ,me gustaria que tuvieran subtitulos por que no se hablar muy bien que digamos ingles.:3
Naiiills😫💕😍
beautiful😘😘
I love how she describes eyeshadow "warm earth tone"
I'm like "you mean brown?"
Hi! I'm a new subscriber...
I miss her videos ):
She lost subs
i freakin love this lip color,holy shit
Do a Harley Quinn makeup tutorial
Shes flawless omg
=^•-•^=
I always find myself going back to this video. love it so much 😍
I'm pretty sure her hair is in French braids loool
This is one of my favorite videos of yours
=^•∆•^=
Her skin is flawless
who misses Michelle??
So does anyone else need that sailor moon compact powder?!
She hasn't posted in 10 months. I miss her videos.
do a makeup collection ?!?😂
I miss you Michelle. 🖤
I think POC, black people in particular have bigger things to focus on and things that honestly deserve our voices and attention instead of people wearing braids (at least the way Michelle is wearing them). I could understand if she had a bunch of cornrows or something,  but this is so minor. We've got to shift our focus to more problematic things. Think people in Flint suffering from toxic water, the school in Detroit that are falling a part, and so many other issues. Speak up on that.
WHERE DID U BUY THE SAILOR MOON POWDER
Glad to see Old YouTubers go back to their original old roots again 💖
your makeup is natural, I like it!
They're what started her as a youtuber. It's nice she does other things but she hasn't done a makeup video like this in so long. I've unfortunately stopped watching, not into pillow talk.
those are dutch braids 😧
I really like this look been fan of michelle since she just started :)
wow shes come a loooong way i remember being subscribed to her since before she got her first million and now she is HUGE in the makeup world! so proud of her! :) she will always be my favorite youtube beauty guru!
No foundation bc perfect skin.. smh
U look lik a light skin blk women
love this💓
I Love You Michelle!!! <3
Braid tutorial please
Wonderful tutorial ! Love it.
I love this look! and as for this being a race thing, im mexican american okay my mother is from mexico and my great grandparents are from spain. But i do not get mad or upset when i see a make up artist post a tutorial saying "hot firey spanish make up and hair" or how around halloween when everyone posts dios de los muertos sugar skulls. Its not hurting anyone and hell it taught me how to do that look better! so leave michelle alone!! she is a sweet loving and caring gentle soul and it makes me sick how people would even think that of her!! Michelle of you see this just know you are loved and i would personally love if you would do a spanish look and title it hot spanish something something idk lol
1 braid = ok
more than one braid = cultural appropriation?
Yeah... No.
=^•,•^=
Thanks for your shares!^^
Where does she get the sailor moon stuff???
I hate the concept of cultural appropriation. It keeps humans separated instead of allowing us to emerse into and appreciate each other's cultures.
I love this Look ❤️😍
Her brows are fleekin goals
The Excitement you get when you realize you have the same pallette as a makeup tutorial
Exact link for exact lashes?!
Love this look on you!
Those nails 😍
Michelle wya miss you tonss and you're videos😔💕
i love it sooo much, i need to try it because it's perfect and looks really natural
Love it I'm going to give it a try 🙈🙈👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️
i feel like lot of the steps in this natural look are so extra. she uses eyeshadow as eyeliner, then literally goes over it with eyeliner. haha personally, i feel like it's too unecessary and time consuming for a natural look >.> but i guess...
you do you michelle <3 its gorgeous
please post more tutorials!!!
MICHELLE YOU NEED TO MAKE MORE MAKEUP TUTORIALS!! I miss them soo much! Your tutorials taught me so many different makeup skills I didn't even know about. You're such an inspiration. Love all the way from Australia❤️❤️❤️
you havent done a makeup tutorial in forever!! this channel was the first makeup channel i watched and now i watch glam and gore. i love your channel because you are a good speaker and i just love you so much but more makeup tutorials please!!!
Seeing people in the comments telling everyone the hairstyle thing is nothing to flip out about.

Not seeing anyone freak out about it.

What...
Is it bad that 3 seconds into the video I knew she was wearing Posh Spice by Jeffree Star? I am OBSESSED with him and his amazing line of cosmetics
i miss my rice bunny
Its been 6 months... Im kinda disappointed :(
You look great without make-up!☺😍
She has such perfect skin!!!❤️❤️❤️
hi I loved your nails can you please do a tutorial on how to make your nails long and healthy thank you
=^ • T • ^=
her voice sooooo relaxing
her voice sooooo relaxing
Your skin is flawless, I hope someday my skin will be as beautiful as yours
Gosh I love this look... My favorite... 😍😍♥️♥️
I FINALLY FOUND THE SONG!! For anyone wondering it’s; U, The One by Sum Wave 😭
how to trick men into bed,lol
she looks gorgeous
earlies ive ever been yes mish i missed your tutorials😍
waw 😄

I wish she started a podcast, i looove her voice❤️
I love her voice it's so soothing
YOURE THE BEST! MISSED YOU SO MUCH 😢
hi ms. michelle phan please answer me how do you edit your videos??? please tell me ty
The music made me feel so weird.
I'm really just sitting and waiting for another make-up tutorial and its been a long time waiting so please make a few more at least just to entertain
I don't recognize half the products Michelle uses....
Love that she doesn't wear foundation. All these gurus wear foundation when they have nothing to hide with their flawless skin and I find it so unnecessary
Please can make more videos ?💔😩
Michelle's hair in this video is beautiful! She has some very nice stylists 🙌🏻💓
You know you made a quality product, when its clocked within the first 2 seconds of the video.
I see you Posh Spice.
HELLO Posh Spice.
My full name is Angeli Cashmere Cleofe
I've always wanted to look like you :/
Her skin is so perfect and luminous
I can't believe she stopped making videos 😭 I've watched every single one of her videos from the very very beginning .. 😭she truthfully will be missed on YouTube by me ❤️😭
IN LOVEEEE WITH THE LIPS 😍😍
Such a beautiful look. I fell in love with her lips!
Any hair type and hair styles is beautiful I honestly think so. Why fight over beauty in general lol? Just appreciate beautiful things and live happy 😊
goals goals goals
I haven't watched her for a while but is she still dating Dominique??
skipped the blush and lip color, and used that general color palette as an everyday look, but she still slayed!
I wish this video just kept the original name, LOWKEY BADDIE. Slaying all day, Michelle. YASSSS.
Michelle what u doing these days? U haven’t posted in like a year
she very buetiful !
Does anyone know the music?
make harley quinn make up tutorial please miss mish :)
yay for korean cosmetic brands!
=^. I . ^=
I come to this video and hear that Michelle got hates for her hair



LIKE WTH ITS HAIR 
GROW UP PEEPS 
IF THE SIMPLEST THINGS IN LIFE BOTHER YOU
Your life iz messed up 
Plus this is A Make up Video
I don't know how its cultural appropriation against black culture when originally mostly latina women wore this style,especially in the 90s.People use to refer tgem as chulas I think.
This hair style is called Dutch braids. Not cornrows. Everyone chill. It's a hairstyle.
i miss you so much mishh♡
ok so Sailor moon eye liner by what brand??? I love her.
boi she posted this a year ago
Did you take down your chobits make up tutorial? I was looking through your videos to try and find it but i can't find it, I wanted to watch it for the nostalgia
hair tutorial!!
i miss herr😢! Youtube rrly needs her positivity🙏🏽
your voice is so calming
What a bunch of crybabies in the comments. You look gorgeous Michelle.
you’re so stunning.
Her outdo music is magical
Why is the title cashmere kitty?
I tried out this look today it's amazing xxx
Stunning!!
It has been almost 10 months since you last uploaded a makeup tutorial!
It's almost halloween! 
Your Halloween looks used to be my favorites...
She has actually replicated a chola look. if you kids dont know what that is... google it. 
only difference is a cholita would use a sharpie for the eyes and dark red lips ! 🤔🤔😅
Use Foundation first the concealer cause if u use concealer first and then use foundation the foundation just wiped away the concealer
You get that sailor moon eyeliner from Japan, right?
I saw the sailor moon eyeliner and went ballistic 😂😂😂
MISSING THIS VIDEOS LIKE CRAZY!! <3
is it just me or is her voice so soothing
SHE HAD DELETED LOTS OF MAKEUP TUTORIALS (I assume those who got reported for BGM copyright)

WHY.
Is her company still alive? Xd
I can't believe people are arguing over this it isn't a race reference it is a pop culture reference... She can wear and say whatever she wants and she should be able to do it without ignorant people insulting her
Here after watching rhett and link 😂
does anyone know any cheap dupes for the liquid lipstick :) ?
Miss you 😁💖
I blew on my screen when there was excess powder on the powder haha.
she sounds like a disney princess😍
No sunscreen on the face? Nightmare for me lol
Michelle!!! upload videos in 2017 pleasee ❤️❤️
Wasn't this video called  low key baddie? Did she change the video's name?
you have a very nice skin
what's the music?
what's the music?
Braids are braids, nothing more to it
I miss her make up tutorials

I just realized that the lippie she used was Jeffree Star's brand
i love michelle, and the music in michelle's videos make the overall feel of the vids 100x better. speaking of, does anyone know the name of the song she used in this one ?
wondering when michelle is going to make another makeup video
Year later, that look still look amazing ❤️💕

When I seen Jefferee Starr's lip piercing my heart sunk 😞 I still love Michelle even tho he's the devil.
JEFFREE
You are goals af
god i love you...you dont transform into another person your doing make up right i want to see me still when im done
Can people STOP using the word ''RACE''please. You all need to stop now! There is one race on the Earth and it is the HUMAN RACE. Saying that there are many races does not make sense. There are many ethnicities but not races.  To Identify someone being Black or White is identify them by their ''colour''of their skin. There are people with dark/brown skin all around the world.  Hispanic/Latino is someone who speak Spanish or who is from Latin America but individuals from those countries have different skin colour. Brazil is from Latin America and has for its national language Portuguese. Asia is a continent that contains obviously many countries where people can be very different from each other.  Indian people and Chinese people are in the same continent but no one would say that an Indian person is Asian. Africa also is a continent where individuals can be different from each other. Algeria and Nigeria are in the same continent but we would call the Nigerian African/Black and the Algerian Arab even though there are Algerians with very dark skin. We are all from the same planet. We have different features and skin colour but at the end, we are all the same inside.  We all have blood that is flowing inside of us! If you still don't get it answer these following questions: What is the ''race'' of someone who is from Sri Lanka? From Pakistan? From Kazakhstan? From Madagascar? From New Zealand? From Afghanistan? From Australia? From Brazil? Can you tell?  You can absolutely not. You cannot put these countries in this categorisation of ''race'' and you cannot for other countries too.  It just does not make sense. We need to love each other more, learn to embrace everyone's culture and ethnicity and stop separate the human being by ''race''.
JEFFREE STAR LIPSTICK!!
god flawless babe, ily xxxxx
I really need those lashes but the link doesnt match yours. Do they have a website? Thx!!
Your face without makeup is so beautiful 😦
this might be annoying but omg so early
is it just me or was the title called something else?
whats the song playing in the background at the beggining of this video
she really just did her edges
MISH POST A MAKEUP TUTORIAL!!!
NO JOKE I LITERALLY GOT THE MICHELLE PHAN COMMERCIAL ON A MICHELLE PHAN VIDEO😱
She has SO MUCH class and grace. A lot of beauty gurus don't have that
I miss you so much.
I can already fall asleep just by watching her videos because of her voice😍its so satisfying and calming
Why are her uploads so inconstant? She never uploads anymore!
this look reminds me of lara croft for some reason :D
She hasn't uploaded in a while...😔😔😔
Love it!!!! <3
it has almost been a year. srsly.
she like never posts videos anymore is she even okay
I think she should have used some primer on her nose area because her pores are so clean that they are so visible
Not my most favorite look
OMG MICHELLE IS YOUR LIP BLEEDING OMG ARE U OKAY?!
Please do Harley Quinn make up boo 😂😍 please , I've been a fan since you first started YouTube and tho I've grown to like other youtubers your still my number one guru ❤️❤️❤️ love you Mich ❤️
BEUTIFUL
Her lips were bleeding? 0:45
this is the first time I watched a tutorial of hers in a long time and I must say she has one of the most relaxing tutorial lol.
...soooo does she not do makeup anymore?...
she was my fave beauty guru!!! i miss her and her soothing voice ☹
日本のコスメが多くてびっくり！
FLAWLESS.
She is the only makeup guru who make it seems so natural. I miss her videos!
I want to do this every day
I miss Michelle
Song???
Miss your videos so much Michelle . Started watching you in 7th grade now I’m about to turn 22 in a month. Your videos inspired me to experiment more with makeup . Hope you’re doing good ! xoxo :)
lookin fresh!
Meeeeeee
You're the og Michelle
Love your voice 🤓
Still looks beautiful without makeup
Rhett and Link did it better 😂
weird question but any army here?😂
Somehow I just knew the old title was gonna cause controversy. People love to fight over stupid things nowadays.
Love this look
you remind me of Ariana Grande
michelle is a goddess.
michelle is my idol i look up 2 u rofl
You're eyes are so brown😭💕😍 I would rather have brown eyes than green😩💘
OMG My inspiration. That's probably why my mom named me michelle too!
i Spy A bloody lip, What Happened?
You were and always will be the best youtuber ever. Hope you are doing well.
Her skin looks like a skin of 10 y/o, magical
dari indo nih
Years later still the makeup queen.
Miss you, Michelle! you are an inspiration! :)
Don't get me wrong I LOVE Michelle's videos but I kinda miss the old videos I hope she will bring back the makeup tutorials that you could wear on special occasions and not as an everyday look. I still love her thought😙
Love this look!
Tbh your nails looks scary
so is nobody else gonna notice that's she puts on a full face of foundation
That's posh spice right?
Her glowy face 😍
What's the song in the beginning? It's beautiful!
I love this look
Um so wtf. you leave your youtube family hanging?
=^•¥•^=
Does  it sound weird to say she is relaxing to listen to.. Her voice is sooo soothing lol😂
Okay wait a minute... People are offended because of her braids...?
hi Michelle i love your videos i have been one of your biggest fans since i was 7 years old and i have some of your makeup from your brand. And let me just tell you your makeup is wonderful . i am gray
the Sailor Moon  Powder is actually pretty expensive.. i remember seing it on this web site which i forgot  the name, for 45 dollars, nop thank you , i prefer eating for 3 weeks than buying a powder.
What are the songs names😊
was the liquid lipstick matte
beautiful!
Someone please tell me the intro song!
Love this look! :)
It’s so weird looking at this video. She never advertise (or rarely) and nowadays ppl are pushing products on us daily. 
I miss you Michelle Phan, but I / we understand there is more to life than YouTube.
michelle where did you go suddenly your not on YouTube anymore we thought you were doing more vids for us but i guess your done
Everyone rocking braids because of Kim Kardashian😬 Nothing wrong with that right?
Huh spends 5 hours on this I think I got the look looks in mirror DANNY DAVITO?!
the colors on that pallete :D
test
MYTHICAL BEASTS???!!
What brushes do you use?
I just 💗 u xxxxxx
DAMN, I just watched a goddess do her makeup... dies from the overcharge of prettiness
Those are not baddie lashes. They're too natural to be considered baddie
lipstick is a no for me
Did she already have an Angelina Jolie make up yet? Her lips would be perfect for it
I love this new look
Her last makeup tutorial.... 💔
My eyes isn't like hers but its ok  I still love watching her
Do you still have your own makeup line? If so is there any new products to look for?
i wish we could live in a world where everything we own could be shared and not be hated for. I just wish our difference could be shared to spread diversity. after all, we are living on one planet :) Peace and blessings Michelle, negativity are not welcomed here. Just do u!.
Do you still have your own makeup line? If so is there any new products to look for?
Did anyone else realize that her lip was bleeding I got the beginning?
Her voice is so calming
0:44 Did anyone notice there's a red spot at her lips?
Michelle has not fallen victim to some ridiculous trends like over the top contouring and highlighting which is why I love her !! Serving natural beauty realness, it seems like most (not all) gurus are going for a very drag queen esque look.
Step 1: be rich
That nail color thoooo 😩👌🏼
Michelle you are the reason I started makeup and you will always be one of my biggest role models but I feel like I never turn to your videos anymore mainly cause I never see makeup tutorials anymore!!! ily!!!!!
What was the video originally called?
This was made on my bday !!
I LOVEEE THIS LOOK
she used to make the best videos on youtube but thats what happens when you get famous. u forget ur roots and where u first came from.
Вау! Очень красивая девушка!
this is cool but what about this is cashmere kitty?
i miss the old michelle phan videos, it's just not the same
I remember watching Michelle years ago, and loving her videos. Then I had a period where I didn't really visit youtube much, and completely forgot about the make up videos on here. Coming back now, I legit cried when I saw how far she's come, how beautiful all of her videos are and how she never fails to make all her videos exciting, interesting and pay so much attention to detail. She mothered most of the other beauty gurus on here today. People are still in the comments complaining, not appreciating the creativity, thought and work that she puts into every video. I'm so glad I came back, these are creative looks I can actually wear and be inspired by, if anyone has an issue with it they can go watch one of the thousands of shitty sponsored channels that copy and paste the same look in every video, they're a dime a dozen. At the end of the day creative artists with a unique style, a positive attitude and who do this for the right reasons will always shine through. I'm so glad I'm back to watching Michelle's videos, best decision ever <3
he quote we all love "Good Luck"
It is so cute love it Michelle!!
mish stopped using foundations for a year now and I'm only starting to use them
I miss you
Always appreciate your minimal makeup use. In a weird way, doesn't look like you're makeup but looks amazing. And those false lashes - I die. Japan is so amazing with crazy good ideas!!
Simple.nice.pretty.easy.
미친 3ce한국꺼 아님????대박대박
Did Dom and her break up? I haven't watched in a while.
This was the last makeup tutorial before the hiatus. I remember waiting for the next one but it never came :<
Why did she change the title?
wtf is a low-key baddie
stop telling her not to put low key baddy its her live u do not control her
does anyone know what brush she was using to line her lower lash line??
I don't care what people say about her. She will always be my favourite. She is the most raw genuine person and is actually the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, inside and out. Never change Michelle
This video went from "lowkey BADDIE" to "lowkey baddie" to "CASHMERE KITTY =^ • + • ^="
❤️❤️
Linda
Your lip was bledding
Great asian pornstar look :O She is very pretty, now I understand all the fuzz about her and why she got successful on youtube.
Good looks are important. Ask the ASMR girls.
omg ur voice :))
youre skin is so flawlesssss
iTs NoT fAiR
loved the blush
I'm not hating or anything, I've just been noticing that Michelle has been uploading a lot of "dark" or "mystical" videos lately. Again, I'm not hating, I'm just curious as to why.
I miss the old Michelle Phan. when she used to do tutorials in her parents' backyard. That's when I discovered makeup and DIYS. 😕
can u Please make a typical Korean makeup tutorial with lip tinted lips etc
Please do your final dynasty look
I love this look!
how did black culture make this look ? its winged eyeliner and contour how is that making it "urban" is what i dont understand ! granted the braids are cornrow esque but lets all be honest here its a MAKE UP LOOK and people of ALL RACE FROM AROUND THE WORLD asian, black, white, hispanic/latino, literally everywhere in the world there are girls who do their makeup like this so can we PLEASE stop saying that this is only made and popularized by ONE race/identity because its not. it was popularized by many groups. saying there should be credit given here is like saying we should give credit to men for inventing makeup in the first place ! its just not true the world makes up looks and the world popularized them.
Her voice is so calming.
Dear Michelle,
     I got this new moisturizer and I've used it two or three times. Now, i dont have acne, but i do get big pimples every once and a while. Every time I use this moisturizer I fat a big pimple. Do I get a new one one or keep using this one?

- a girl with a hydrated face👍
I love her natural looks
La musique svp ? ❤
Even though you don't upload much, you're still the only one that still teaches me new things. Who would have thought a purple blush looks so natural?? Your so original and crearive. Hope you get more make up tutorials up ❤️❤️
I miss michelleee😔
I'm happy to live in a country where no one gets attacked for feeling inspired by other cultures and celebrate them by rocking their hairstyles. 
"MeRrIcA" is always the worst.
When I think of a Baddie chick I think of Beyonce or Janet Jackson, those real fierce, in your face kind of girls. Michelle is just.....really adorable haha. She's like a cute doll, I don't think she falls into the "Baddie" category. I love this makeup look tho (: and by the way everyone, I'm half African American (Eritrean) and I had cornrows in my head for almost 3 years and trust me y'all, what she has isn't even CLOSE to cornrows.
Shes the OG beauty guru shes looking at those wannabe beauty gurus like bow down to the queen
even with so many videos out there, i still come back to watch yours ☺️
Michelle is so pretty
Much respect to Michellephan for staying her own person despite all the new current beauty trends .Shes very different from most beauty gurus that you'll find in YouTube today.
This is one of the most basic tutorials ever, and poorly done at that.
I'm black and I can't see anything wrong with this video. French braids? Seriously? She's not wearing dreads or box braids or cornrows. French braids aren't necessarily very African, a lot of European cultures having been doing this for YEAAARS. And her baby hairs weren't geled down like we do them, ppl with straighter hair textures tend to have baby hairs that naturally lay or wave
how i missed u and ur old vids with ur voice and not new voices or subs
I haven't watched you for 4 years omfg
You should be a voice actor for a cartoon  😁
Man this is fancyyy
Her makeup tutorials get so many more views than her other ones just saying I love all her videos
WHAT PALLET IS SHE USING?!?!
I wish you still did makeup tutorials like this.
are you Vietnamese
SO GLAD THAT YOU USED CRUELTY FREE PRODUCTS !!!
Don't tell me.. That this is her last make-up tutorial?
Pleaaasseee post! Ilysm
i love this look and the color because that's exactly how my avatar in gta v is like. so this is exactly the style i love!
Who looks at this and knows that the there never going to do it
I should be doing hw but eh
Giống nhất là chị Lan Khuê
I like her cornrows... Dutch braids... French braids...? I don't even know anymore 😖
I miss her so much she was the first person to get me into makeup and after watching her for years she has left and I don’t know where it breaks my heart to see her not make videos anymore
How do you get copyright?
Good god. Its hair. Anyone can wear it. 'Black women were bashed for it so you're not allowed to wear it' 
Thats like saying:  'women where burned for knowing lots about nature and medicine so you're not allowed to know anything about it'
Oh wow I'm SO SORRY she's wearing her hair the wrong way?? Do you guys know what you're fighting about? HAIR
wtf no entiendo nada
Rhett and Link copied this (Lowkey Dad Tutorial)
Such a pretty look🙂
She's so pretty and she's amazing at makeup. She's likes the best
what was the first song used
Love this look :)
*****
Have any people with dark skin done this and gotten good results? I just wanna know before I try it. The colors don't seem like they'd work for darker skin colors but idk.
Her voice is majestic af
Why isn't she posting any more
^----^
>●^●<  ♡
Miss you..
I am Vietnamese are you

i used to watch her videos and look up to her so much cause she was doing what she wanted and she seemed so happy. knowing that she wasn't as happy as i thought really breaks my heart. i love her so much and all the feels to her💜💜
I will always support u, michelle. love xoxo from Malaysia :)
does anyone know the lash style
R her and Dom still together?
she is so pretty
"i know putting on mascara seems terrifying" , who does she think she's talking to?
I love ur videos
I miss mish so much I'm watching this once every week now
minority of black people shouting cultural appropriation in the comments but isn't it called a french braid or dutch braid? congratulations you played yourself dj khaled voice
I love you
I literally just read everything in the comment section and I couldn't find the racist comments. I'm missing out.
= ^ • ^ =
She forgot the glow! I just did this tutorial for no reason and I NEED TO BLIND THE HATERS
The title i cant
which palette is she using?  I like those colors.
hearing her talk is relaxing? i wanna take A nap now....
giong pham huong
i miss her
So jealous of her clear skin 😭
I just wanna know what the names of the music is that she used :/
I miss you :(
I’m missing Michelle, she gave me many good memories and taught me so much, not only in makeup but also in life. It would be so nice if she came back, but I think it’s better for her to live her life, love you Michelle
Does anyone think this would go well with a darker lip? (Maybe like a dark plum?)
Who cares about where her damn braids are from!?
She didn't put any foundation?
i watched this video more than i watched my own video
She just recreated a Kylie Jenner look
It’s really blurry, like her face. Well I wore this look for my first date today lmao 😍😂
I miss her :(
she needs to be a voice actor
Who came here from swoozie’s video
i don want to be lowkey... 
i want to be a complete BADASS😂💖 gorggg as always!
I feel like i just woke up in the morning drinking tea, while im in paradise relaxin.. all because of your voice..😍❤🍃 
Girl come bacccck! 😭😞
I really miss her. Most of the makeup techniques I use now are because of Michelle and how I learned to love make up even more than I used to. But I really do hope she’s happier now. If she ever comes back I hope she'll bring the beauty community back to the way it used to be. Love you Michelle, take care and be safe wherever you are bae. ❤️❤️
I haven't seen her videos for like 3 years, but... she looks different.. but I can't seem to place it.
btw, are these featured products that she's paid to promote or actually recommend?

Why did she stop making videos?
where are you from
It's cultural appropriation because of the use of AAVE (the way lowkey, which is not appropriation, was used with baddie), baby hair, and corn rows.  They look like french braids to me but it seems a little bit coincidental that someone who follows trends like Michelle would combine them in this way.
See she still does regular stuff
I miss her a lot!
I like that she doesn't use all the common luxury brands like YSL or Lancôme or Mac, she's very unique just like the brands she uses
help I have really round eyes and when I put eye shadow on my lid you can barely see it what do I do
who else misses her videos?
Dutch Braids or cornrows it really doesn't matter
Michelle's voice is calming. 😊
okay, heres a challenge for all make up youtubers out there. Try put on make up inside a car as a passenger. ^^
Chị ơi chị là người Việt phải không ạ? Em nghĩ chị nên làm video vietsub ấy ạ, tại e coi mà nhiều chỗ không hiểu 😿
Did anyone else notice how ahead Michelle was?? She called this look a “baddie look” at first.... before “baddie” was a trend... now, so many ppl, not just black ppl, talk abt Instagram “baddies” & such... if she released this video again rn, no one would care..... just we weren’t used to the term
Her Lips are so naturally plump and pink it's cute😭 In jealous ❤
miss you michelle 😢
EVERYONE CAME FROM AFRICA. Case Closed
I know u might not see this comment....but if you do can u plz do another Anime Makeup for Morgiana from Magi? ><
Will you be doing anymore Makeup tutorials? Its been a while:(
I don’t even get how incorporating or appreciating someone’s culture is shaming them like- braids aren’t even a cultural thing
Guys! I need your help! Could you please recommmend a natural looking foundation for oily skin? Thanks!
I had no idea of this "cultural appropriation" until I scrolled through the comments.
Hou mai god
You're so beautiful, strong, funny and everyone Envys you,  you're intelligent and soooo friendly. I can see why everyone misses you so much! And so do I. You're unreal at makeup, it's crazy!! You're amazing in every way
Woooow this looks so different... in a good way
I love this look!!😍😍
I love how she sounds so calm
I hope you'll make beauty videos again like this Mish. Miss you! <3
beautiful look
Is it just me or is Michelle not even good at makeup compared to a lot of you tubers lately
Is she still with dom?
pause at 0:23
When she talks she sounds so intelligent and beautiful :)
I miss her she literally taught me to do makeup
Did you guys notice that the woman who did her hair is black lol
i keep watching ur videos and it make me sad that u arent making them anymore
sooooo miss these videos
I think Mich looks absolutely stunning and so would anyone else with this look! Black, white, purple, it doesn't matter your race. we live in a society where everyone takes offense to everything when in reality it's shouldn't be offensive at all! Do black ladies get hate when they do a "white girl" hair, make up, and outfit look? no! fashion is supposed to be universal, it shouldn't be that just because Michelle isn't black she can't wear her hair in braids or wear dark lipstick. We all need to learn how to embrace each other instead of bashing one another for wearing make up and doing out hair.
Does she reply guys?
does anyone know the first song?
please come back
her lip was bleeding in the beginning after she wiped her lip lmao
Why did she change the name to Cashmere Kitty? The name before was Lowkey Baddie! Who remembers?
If I had makeup this would be my everyday look
where is michelle now? its been awhile i didn't see her in youtube., ;-(
I know it was her decision for the best, but i miss her!!! I always come back to her videos. It is so calming for me!!!
I love Michelle, as she was the first ever makeup guru that ever existed in the youtube community. I grew up watching her videos and it just made me happy.

What I don't appreciate now is that you left us all hanging. :/ I mean I understand that you want to start fresh, but that doesn't mean you can't put out a video letting us know that you're okay or any updates. And I understand you're busy as hell with other things, but i hope you didn't forget about your OG subscribers that have supported you from the beginning. 

I don't mean for this comment to be so negative, we just really miss you on this platform.
:(
What is the music please ?
Is she were to do a trend report in 2018 it will be edges
dang i miss her :(
right, this is for people who go on about a little thing called 'cultural appropriation'. Culture is something that should be shared between one another and was what, in the past, brought many different groups together. If we do not share our different cultures and ideas together, we will eventually become divided and, instead of appreciating the beauty of someone's culture, we will fear it. We should live in a place where ideas of beauty and love are shared as it will brighten up our world. For anyone reading this, you are beautiful - your culture does not change that.
Missed seeing her on yt :( ❤
😍☺😊
....Why is her profile pic all black?
OMG SHE USED JEFFREE STARLIPSTICK ASLKDFJLSADFIOWUE

shes so pretty
Hmm I think Michelle did a very good job with this. I can see how this was "black" inspired and tbh, I  think it looks great. And I personally like culture sharing. we're in 2016, let's break down the walls and embrace our individual history and culture but also be happy to share it
Her voice is so Mother Nature 🌎😂lol
I think she should use foundation in her tutorial....
One of my all time favorite looks. I don't do makeup besides blush and/or lipstick because I feel like I look ugly in it soooo.. but I'm a more natural girl. I only enhance the features I like and leave the others alone. 
My lips and cheeks. My eyes is iffy. but lips and cheeks, mainly lips, are a must.
I'm in love with this look <3
mish please come back
very sweet
very sweet
+Michelle Phan what do I do to remove makeup if I'm allergic to makeup wipes
i couldn't  stop watching her lips bc they were bleeding
Kawaii!
GUYS!!!!! CHILL!!!! Mish is not trying to be disrespectful to any culture with her braids. She is not mocking them and she doesn't even mention them. Even if she was wearing cornrows, why would it matter!? These hairstyles do not belong to a certain race. I understand that women have gotten denied jobs over their natural hair and don't get me wrong, that is seriously screwed up, but that had nothing to do with this video! Some companies do that! You cannot blame everyone for wearing a cute hairstyle! I personally don't think cornrows are "rachet" and I don't really understand why they are considered that, but that's just me.
Come back michelle!!  
We miss u
I miss you
her lip was bleeding :( poor boy
Heheh my names in the title
Hey Michelle, I'm starting 7th grade next year and I just wanted to know if you could do like a makeup tutorial and like an outfit showcase. I don't know what to wear, and my goal is to look good this year, I would love it so much. Just like an back to school look would be great! I love you Michelle!
well It's not like Michelle is white either, so make up your minds haters lmao
Her voice is so calming
=^・ｪ・ ^=
she is a joy to watch, what talent
I only watch this video because of her nails and your hair.
=^ • - •^=
---⊙--⊙---
MEOW.....
I still like Michelle Phan's vs even if there are thousnds of new make up tutorials are coming out now.Her make up tutorials are so simple and easy to understand.
I miss your videos Michelle!!!
Anybody know what name/style of lashes she got?
YOUR VIDEOS ARE SO FRICKING MAJESTIC
Legit she would look great without even concealer!!
hey michelle, i adore your videos but i have a question. im a american, so your asian face doesnt really fit mine XD is there any american beauty gurus you recommend that might fit my facial type?
what happened to her????
Michelle come back
there havent been any new videos is it because your busy say something if u see this
Am I the only one who realizes that most beauty gurus look really pretty without makeup
0:44 did you cut your lip?
love u sweet girl your still my favorite..
Why did she change the title
Is there a scar on your lip?
Oh my god why is she sooooooo cute
People seriously claiming that this is cultural appropriation she’s wearing Dutch braids something I would wear when I was five years old people need to quit claiming everything is cultural appropriation I’ve seen people claim that wearing hoop earrings is cultural appropriation it’s an earring Just like this is a braid that a mom would put in a child’s hair
Why is this called the "baddie" look
For the lips you should have used Kylie's lip glosses the matte colors are so much better than Jeffrey's imo
you're beautiful
She hasn't changed one bit
I was the makeup artist for a video-shoot 2 months ago and I chose this look for everyone - including myself
This was like one of her last, if not the last, makeup tutorials she posted.That makes me so sad.
We miss you so much :(((
I miss her
michelle,  I don't understand why you use a  bb creams , you don't need it#girlrmpowerment
Many native Americans and Caucasians wear their hair like this as children! It is not exclusive to one race.
If i looked like her without makeup i would never wear it again
do u have any Asian in u ja
i know my comments are so late and that she could have some other make up tutorials, but this is the first I've watched.. really..for me, this is the kind of make up that i like to see, doesn't look so heavy on the face and not too much drama..no wonder she has a lot of followers..#michellephan
where has she vanished? i miss her videos
people want to talk about cultural appropriation while wearing 15,000 bundles of Brazilian, Malaysian, Filipino, Armenia hair. STOP IT. Fact is, we are all inspired by other races and we ALL "steal" things from other races. Hush up and be flattered! other people think what you're doing is cool. I'm sure we have more important things to worry about smh ... oh and btw (like it matters) I'm black :)
Hell no.. U call this a look... Its so muddy
Your lip was bleeding
Who’s here in 2018??
Hey Michelle, can you do a David Bowie tribute tutorial, please? That would mean a lot. He was pretty amazing. Please consider it?
Cool
this was posted on on the day my brother was born
Bringing back memories. Decided to pull up her old makeup tutorials. I loved when she used to make these makeup tutorials.
I have that mascara
YESSSSSSS haha love you Michelle!! You've been my idol for what seven years now?!
Where are you? :(
what is the Song  ?
Anyone noticed she is using Jeffree Star’s liquid lipstick?
wow so pretty Michelle ☺☺☺
Your skin is beautiful
Her bottom lip was bleeding on 0:35
mish u has a cut on your lips... oh gosh.. get well soon dear...
imissyou michelle :(
So many people do Asian trend inspired makeup and give credit but not when inspired by Black culture
I kind of miss these kinds of videos. Not saying that I mind the ones that she puts out now. I love them because they are so helpful, but it's weird to know that she hasn't posted one like this in a while.
You’re such a blessing and inspiration...
Comeback pleaseee huhuhu😢😢
she's so cute aah
Im mexican and i have baby hairs and eversince i can remember my mom has always put braids on me. I don't believe this is culturally inappropriate. All the negras are getting mad because it's "mimicking and mocking" their culture. Okay then if you feel offended towards your "culture" then STOP buying extension! STOP buying Brazilian hair and wigs and live with your nappy, kinky, curly hair. There problem solved.
You have the same name as me!!!!
i miss her videoo
are you a Filipino?
why haven't you posted a new makeup tutorial I'm so so so so so sad if you would do a mermaid or gypsy look I would be sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy
I am 100% sure
 that if a girl/woman with blonde hair, light eyes and light skin color did this look on herself
 NO ONE
 would even for one second think that there's something inappropriate about it...:/
Anyone else here from Rhett and Link’s parody “Lowkey Dad”? No? Just me? Ok.
In my understanding, this is not cornrows.

French and Dutch braids add to the two outside sections only, cornrows add to all three sections.  And usually, cornrows are braids which go straight back across the entire head. I have never seen Dutch braids done in more than 2 braids.  I'm mean I have portraits of my grandma using this in poland. Idk anymore
Can you please do the "full face using only lipsticks" challenge?
Nice
I need her face.
miss u
Best.     Makeup look.         Ever.
are we not gonna point out that her lip is bleeding?
This is a prime example of how POC are  can also be guilty appropriating culture. Shame on you, Michelle.
Cringe in the beginning
your fans are asking for u thank you Michelle Phan cause of you I have a clear face !!!!
Was her lip bleeding?
hey i need some help, i want to start wearing make up and am stumped on the type of foundation to by i already know my shade(360 loreal)  but the problem is i have a Dark upper lip. wht do i do?
FINALLY, her good old make up tutorials.... I missed these so much. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do more of these, we don't get nearly enough anymore
how cute
it's 2018 and i'm still watching this
her nails are goals
Who came here after gmms low-key dad 😂😂
What is the Red Dot on your Lips??
Does she only post once a month now ?
michelle plzzzzz come back.... 😭😭😭😭😪😪😪
I'm 10 and I want to be u when I grow up
good video you do agood job
take it as a compliment. if she's using cultural inspirations in her work, why is that a bad thing?
you removed some of your videos)):
Just because a certain style of hair is associated with a certain people..they don't OWN it!  Hair comes out of your follicles and you are free to do whatever you want with it
what is the background music?
What I have read is that the biggest problem with cultural appropriation is how people are treated when they do something like this. Apparently, when an African American does something like box braids, cornrows or dreads, they are made fun of or insulted, but when a Caucasian person does it, it is considered "beautiful" or "cute", which in reality, they look GORGEOUS on all races. Can someone please explain to me why in our generation today, different races are still treated differently?
is  cade your  boyfriend lol
She's not that great at makeup. I don't understand the praise she gets.
Ok it's been more than a year and I'm still curious on what brush she used for her eyeliner w/ the powder from the Tartelette in Bloom Eyeshadow. Somebody. End. My. Curiosity. Please. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️😭😭😭😭😭⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I miss her :(
I have no problem with cultural sharing. In fact, I commend it & wish it would happen more! I love seeing people of different cultures trying new things :D However, I do not like it when one race is bashed & made fun of for having a certain look, but when done by another race it is seen as hip. Needless to say, it is important that we love, share, & be happy. Our world will be a better place if we just learn these few things...
I miss her :(
3:41 my holy grail is shoes????

Why everyone say that is a culture appropriation ? If it is, what's the problem ? I mean, we can't make braids because we are not black ? We can't do a cosplay because we are not Japanese ? We can't wear a béret because we are not French ? We can't dance zumba because we are not latinos ? Just, what's wrong with you ?? Be open to over cultures is not criminal. We should stop doing discrimination. We should go everywhere around the world, share our cultures with others. This is not a culture appropriation, this is a culture sharing.
her make-up tutorials are the best in the entire universe!
Why does everyone talk about white and black,and cornrows...Why can't we be just the way we are?
0:37 your lip is bleeding!
I LOVE that look on you
Ha. Don't make me laugh. Ancient people from all over the world had been wearing braids and hair twists since before they even laid eyes on the Africans. The Vikings braided their beards, the Native Americans had all sorts of braided styles, the Europeans had their own unique braids - woven with flowers and such - and so did ancient civilizations in Asia. Everyone from all over the world, Africa included, wore their hair in braids and twists. You cannot claim something that doesn't even belong to you. Braids were used for thousands of years all over the world. And Jesus Christ, don't get me started with this whole big butt, full lips, tan skin, curly hair shit you ignorant buffoons are going on about.
I love you Michelle .
she did not wear foundation when will i ever
go to the work!!!
Look like Lan Khuê
her voice is soooo soothing omg
why do people bash her with her hair? Like WTF? I wear it everyday in school!! What is the issue here?
PS: dads account (who else is watching in 2017)
2018?
how do u get ur face soo clear like that Mi?
De verdad como extraño tu voz tus vídeos SE TE EXTTAÑA MUCHO
To people saying, "oh, so I'm not allowed to have baby hairs because I'm insert ethnicity/race?". Um, no. I am a white woman of Armenian descent, and Armenians tend to have a lot of hair, ESPECIALLY baby hairs. No one is saying just because you're a certain race, you "aren't allowed" to have baby hairs. HOWEVER, in this particular video, baby hairs is referring to the manner in which they're gelled down. This style is something that black and Latin women have been doing for years, but have been ridiculed and judged for. But when white women in haute couture and runways wear their baby hairs gelled down, they are praised for it. See the problem here? Black/latin women w/ gelled baby hairs= not ok. White women w/ them= stylish, avant garde.

Michelle is a very talented makeup artist and guru, but I do think it's important she knows the difference b/w cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation. To appreciate another culture, one must be invited by someone in that culture to partake in their culture. Just because she grew up around Black American culture, doesn't make it ok to appropriate it into her style.
I wonder what you’re doing at this moment?🤔😌
Wow 😲
=^. _ . ^=
Ahhhhh, never gets old!
So you tryna look black?
Can anyone please tell me what's the exact name of the Tartlette eyeshadow palette Mish used?
which nail color are you wearing
how did she get cheekbones?
her voice is so soothing
Its like she fashioning the looks towards Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. Anyone else notice that?
Is she half American half vietnam?
2019❤
2018!?!?!?
I love this look!
What a disgusting concept "cultural appropiation" there's always americans fighting over it on these videos. I bet it was made by a white guy to keep you all well segregated and  fighting.
What is the red on her mouth?
If anybody reads Helios: Femina on Webtoons (also by Michelle Phan) you can see the similarity between the main character and Michelle, unless that was on purpose. Also Kazu looking like Her boyfriend. hmm😊😊
Your lip is bleeding!
Can u do gradient lips
"cultural appropriation" ? seriously ? where are in 2016 come on !
Why didnt she wear lime crimes cashmere?
i love all ur videos
I really miss michelle's tutorials
She did the Kylie shadow cat eye before everybody else did.She is always ahead if the game
the title of this is embarrassing
i 💗😺
tbh her make is great and all its very clean but its just too simple they kinda all have the same style ? theres no drama or specialty compared to other makeup youtubers such as .. carli byble and such
i watch michelle's vids whenever i want to remember my childhood. my first video from michelle was the snow white makeup look and ever since then i loved watching her videos. i give her respect and i wish her next makeup line can be a hit
Krall
Michelle isn't wearing cornrows. But if she were and any black person felt like it was cultural appropriation, they're entitled to their opinion. Non-black individuals have no influence over black feelings.  Braids originated in Africa, Nubia to be more specific and were also associated with Social class and societal roles. And black people today don't wear braids for fashion like white people do, it's to protect our hair and retain length. The more you know.
ねこฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
God I just wish someday I'll get to meet Michelle and give her a huge hug
The best part about her videos is ...they are to the point, no useless or pointless stupid discussion before or between the subject matter.
Galing naman
you seem perfectly😍😍💘
Why don't americans put mascara on the lower lash line?
With your oil slick hair you should create a look to match
Why is it that in Britian (where I happen to live), we don't have issues like this? Like, seriously, no one cares if you wear braids, have dreadlocks, have gelled down baby hairs, listen to rap, use slang (our slang words orginate from chavs - look it up americans), we are all just chill when it comes to shit like that.
I think what black people are trying to say is there's a double standard for braids (cornrows, box braids, specifically more than two, lots of other cultures wear braids) for white girls and black girls. It's not really fair to know there's a double standard and still take advantage of it, and then say we can't get mad. Sometimes, white girls don't get to have access to everything, and in today's society, neither do poc. (nothing is wrong with mich's braids, they're just French braids)
I make 10 sec vids pushing random objects
now keep this comment at an even number of likes
Please comeback Michelle
Does anyone know what she says at the very beginning of the video?
É tanta coisa que ela passa na cara que nao sei como ela nao tem alergias,manchas na pele!! quem dera ser rica rsrs $$
I give up on this comments section. I tried to explain cultural appropriation, but these white people dont get it. sigh lets just enjoy Michelles make up video and forget about this? she changed the name because she saw people were getting offended and she respected that.
Omg them eyes tho
She did all her makeup tutorials much more attractive than these cakey makeup these days
Hey guys is she dead??
How about high key appropriation for a title?
Gala my as ere me you
I know she left YouTube because staying isn’t healthy for her anymore but I still miss her videos here. :(
Hey MiMi..my Mom and I are trying to make vids so she can take her of her Dr. bill and I want to her a house. Nothing big.   Just for us ...Papa and Matka. Pleaase scribe!  I know you are famous and we are nobody.
Hey MiMi..my Mom and I are trying to make vids so she can take her of her Dr. bill and I want to her a house. Nothing big.   Just for us ...Papa and Matka. Pleaase scribe!  I know you are famous and we are nobody.
I really miss your old videos Michelle. :( you used to be our friend, not some unattainable, unreachable person. I'm happy you're doing well, but I just miss the time when you weren't reading a pro script and you were just a girl doing fun tutorials sitting on the floor and talking to us like a friend. Take care
Why did she stop wearing foundation,was it ruining her skin??
your voice is so relaxing ♡ love you !!
God I Can't handle Your prettiness 😍
Do you know tailajoy18/Taila
I thought of Lara Croft (Angelina's version) when I saw this. Probably because of the colors and braids :p Love it <3
can you do an ulzzang look???
does anyone know where i can buy the sailor moon powder??
could you do a video for women of colour because it's really hard to find bb creams etc that can match us because makeup is limited
so pretty ...and cute
did Michelle change the title? or is it just me..
I had a Michelle Phan ad before this video
In traditional german style (in Bavaria), these braids are used too... like, really, I do not get this stuff.
her skin looks sooooo good. I wish I have skin like hers. Also michelle, can you make a video for prom. I have one coming soon and I don't know what to do!
what an absolutely stunning human.
im here coz of the Rhett and Link parody, anyone elsee?
Loved everything but the lipstick - I think I'm going to try it with a little more of a pink toned nude lip color, or just a tinted balm. :)
Ok everyone: hairstyles are not for a single culture. braids have been shared through many cultures (African American, Hungarian, Korean, Indian...). We should all stop arguing over "which race can wear what", and enjoy that the cultures have come together, and that braids are popularizing. It proves how the cultures have influenced modern style, and we should not discriminate that.
what color did she use for her lips? i know its jeferee star but idk what color...
she should wear concelour around her nose, when she said to cover up redness she didnt even cover ?
why doesn't she still do these video's? who else wants her to do these again
this is blackface
Michelle i think this hair style looks AMAZING with this look!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😍😍
Please do an tutorial of how you did your AMAZING  hair style!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love hearing your voice whenever you are doing your videos- its so soothing!!
MOMMY YOU NAILED IT AGAIN :D #MichellePhanAlways
i tried this look out and i feel so badass. lol. thanks michelle!
Brilliant!
I had a Michelle Phan ad for dis vid. Anyone else? 😘
The thing about pleasurable mascara is so relatable!
Flawless!
What flavor was the lip scrub
HOW DOES I MAKE MEH HUR DAT PURRTY?!
Not so preety..!!!
I'm in love with the music which was playing throughout this video. Does anyone know the name of it? :)
=^.i.^=
I wear French braids and my baby hairs stick out, apparently I'm appropriating cultures and am racist now. I don't think there is hope anymore for 2016.
Wtf is up with this cultural hair bullsh*t?! Its braids people of all color wear braids lol. Anyways I'm so jealous of her sailormoon eyeliner and powder! Its super cute!!
what is the brushes' brand
do she lives in america
I'm sorry Michelle for adding to the negativity but this HAS to be said. PREACH WHAT YOU TEACH. if she cant wear braids you can't wear wigs for fashion. DOUBLE STANDARD much ? Stop with the ignorance already.
i agree with culture appropriation coz slowly by slowly blacks are being copied every day especially nowadays.... big lips, big butt, tan, curly hair/afro, braids, dreads etc..
Isn't it really hard to do your makeup with your long nails?💅
Hey Michelle! Hope you could post some more Beginner Tutorials. Love you! xoxo
This makeup look is perfect!
can you do a tutorial for that hairstyle
great video!!!! sometimes your face looks like a young teen so I'm surprised if yup you're like around 25
Michelle's  skin looks younger than mine despite being older than me
헐 스컨아 대박
More videos like This plssss😍
Is the tune from an anime? If so anyone know what it is? I've dying to know because it brings me back soo much from childhood :') 5:44
In lovveeee with this look
This single tutorial costs 529.71 not including brushes and blenders
"Every" Woman looks better whitout Make up and tons of other Stuff. JUST BE NATURAL! #Naturalface
lol is this the same person from 2009? :o
Her voice is really relaxing loool
You look pretty with makeup and without it. But I just wanted to tell everybody that there are natural alternatives to these "high quality" makeup brand that are filled with carcinogens (cancer causing substances). I suggest red apple lipsticks, alima pure, living libations, nvey eco for your makeup needs, they have products with minimal and natural ingredients, let's use natural makeup for our natural makeup looks
Did anyone notice her lip was bleeding in the beginning??
I miss her makeup videos. They're the reason I subscribed and she never makes them anymore. Unsubscribed.
Step #1 have perfect skin. You didn't use any foundation and just a little bit of concealer. Like this look won't work if you don't have clear skin..
Soooooooo, are we going to skip over the fact that she is mimicking the look of an Afrikan American girl. Like, are we just going to ignore the appropriation and chalk it up to, "Oh, Michelle is so awesome."? 

Bruh, go on Instgram right now and look at how many brown skinned beauties she stole this look from INCLUDING THE BRAIDS AND BABY HAIR.

Over this.
Please make video how to make easy cut crease 👀👯💄💋
you look spook beautiful even with no makeup.BTW love your videos💜
Oh my such a simple look goes a long way and your voice is so relaxing ahhh~~
hello i just saw a Line webtoon with "Michelle Phan" as the writer, is that you?^_^
you are so kawaii 😻 i love you
What's the background song? I love it but I can't find it😭😭😭
Omg u look more beatiful without makeup, than i do with makeup!
So beautiful Michelle!!
Guys braids are a multi-cultural thing. She looks good and feels good and that's important
best thing abt this look is lip color.
Am I the only one who realize that she changed the title
her voice is so calm
Why is everyone talking about the braids. Who cares what someone else does its there choice. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't make it right or wrong. Braids are braids.
Are mish and Dom still a thing or did they break up??
Can you do a video for people who want to start with makeup, but don't know where? Like explaining brushes, concealer etc.?
외국뷰티유튜버는 자막이 없는구나...우리나라는 외국 사람들한테 인기조금만 더 얻어보자고 영어자막쓰는데
Another Michelle Phan ad before Michelle Phans video
Her lips were bleeding 😱
i did the makeup and.....iwas popular at the playground...they called me joyfulkitty..
she has 500 mil wow
she deadass looks like me in this video. or do i look like her??? idek anymore
michelle: this is a baddie look
michelle: uses a sailor moon eyeliner
when Mish said "BAAAM!!!" I was like.....
"okay did Michelle even know G.O.D?!" lol my kpopers feelz 😂😂😂😂😂
WHERE CAN I FIND THE SAILOR MOON EYE LINER?
Your skin is FLAWLESS
I could listen to your voice for hours, it's the sweetest and most relaxing voice i know
Love ur hair🐱🐈
whatever she wears looks flawless 😍
That sailor moon powder is sooooo pretty omg
Your videos are hypnotizing
Her nails and her hair is gorgeous
Who did ur braids, I love them there awesome like you😍😍
Why did she changed the name it was called Lowkey Baddie
is it only me, or does she looks like an Asian version of angelina jolie.
I dont know why but to me personally she looks like an Asian Angelina Jolie. NO HATE just sayin she is gorgeous like whatttt
they are braids, just that, braids, i'm from south america and my mom used to braid my hair when i was little... i never thought that only some people could wear braids...i actually never thought it at all, i really don't understand cultural appropiaton ( if someone could explain me i will really be happy to learn), what i mean is that we live in a multicultural world, everything it's mixing and i don't think it's a bad thing, i can totally understand the history and the importance of some elements in differents cultures, but that doesnt mean it's an exclusive of them... i wouldnt wear a bindhi, for obvious reasons... but braids tho...
Is it me but, she kinda looks like Ariana Grande?
Miss your videos.
I have a question when filling in your brows are they supposed to be identical.
im watching her old videos just because i miss her voice, where is she? i hope she's doing fine!!! :(
Theres a dot on u r 
lips
Hair tutorial please?
ARE YOU RELATED TO PROMIES
Michelle please do a everyday makeup chalenge
Me and Michelle are the same when it comes to mascara 👀👀👀
Love this :)
Hi Michelle my name is Michelle Too!
anyone know the music?
She should do more with dom again.
Everyone is wearing these type of braids why get mad at her she is just doing makeup like chill out😳
Are people so bored with themselfs or they just dont have anything nice to say? Its a make up video, comment on that or dont comment at all ;-)
Im seeing all these comments about people complaining about other people taking her hair as offensive..... but I dont see any hate comments like that ANYWHERE :P
Pretty sure braids have existed in almost every culture if not all, at some point in history, ancient Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and across Europe braids have been worn so please, drop that tumblr philosophy and save it for another day
And I love how people are saying she is being disrespectful towards "Indians" but it is actually disrespectful to call then "indians" is more polite to call them Natives or Native Americans
You guys are complaining about cultural appropriation so I guess you need to stop wearing eyeliner. Eyeliner was first used in Egypt and as an Egyptian I find it incredibly offensive that you guys are copying our culture. (I was making a point, I don't actually think wearing eyeliner is cultural appropriation lol)
Comment section 
" Braids are not cultural appropriation"
"Who is watching in 2015
All I see are comments saying that this isn't cultural appropriation yet I have yet to see a comment deeming it so
She's not uploading a new video:(
should have played cashmere cat's music
knowing that she wasn’t happy doing this but did it for us anyway, breaks my heart
LOVE THIS MAKE UP LOOK SO SO MUCH MICHELLE!!! <3
Does nobody want to talk about the fact that gmm did a parody of this?!?!?!
=^ 0 I 0 ^=
      -----
Love this look! So fall 🍁
i love this look sooooooo much. i think this gon be my everyday look
Like I wanna see u go full coverage girl
She is honestly so pretty without makeup
Rhett and Link did a parody of this, it's called "LOwkey dads"
You are so CUTE!~
I could sleep to her voice. so soothing
for a makeup guru like her, I thought she already knew that dots won't work as effectively as rub it where you need it. Either one is wrong. I'll just stick with Michelle .
She's so pretty, I hate myself 😭
At 0:37 did anyone notice that Michelle's lips were bleeding
I wondering if she still wirh dom havent seen them together lately
I am not crazy for this look. I am a little hesitant to use such a shade on my lips since it would probably look odd on my skin tone. Those nails however.... I am loving. what polish is that? positively beautiful! You looked amazing btw. seems you can pull off anything.
I want to recreate this look so badly but I can't afford those products :/
what's the song at the end? :)
lol some of these comments are just........ daf!!!! i just caaaaaaannnn'tt... Michelle love the look gonna try it myself..
this look is so hard to do 😣😤😣😤
Does she sell her own make up and haloween make up if not then she should !! Xx
Wow a Michelle Phan ad came up before I watched this video 😂
95% of comments saying how braids aren't cultural appropriation. 5% miscellaneous. I haven't found a single comment hating on her hair. Come on people lets move on to more important topics like the fact that there's a sailor moon eyeliner like what????
Everyone here is just talking about braids. Am I the only one here from Rhett and Link's Lowkey Dad tutorial?
Your voice is soooooo relaxing and calm. I love you Michelle
Could you do a video tutorial on only one product line? Kinda like to test out a  companies makeup ? Thank you😊
love your makeup look videos!
=^•^=
this is my favourite look
Then were did she by the sailors moon blush
Braids aren't exclusive to one culture, I remember me and my friends having hair like that for primary school yeeeeeeaaaaars ago
i should try this look !
was ur lip bleeding? and thanks this makeup look is so cool
Your face is SOOOOO flawless!
I really love these tones thanks mish
I LOVE YOUU
Are you serious? Michelle literally set this trend of wearing cornrows in 2016. Now I walk down on the street, and all I see are cornrows
Anyone noticed that she looks a bit like Angelina Jolie in this video? Just saying
=^ > + < ^=
It’s so sad to think a whole team of people were watching her do this, it was never only her doing it for fun. I miss her so much
Anyone out there that thinks her hair is in cornrows you’re WRONG that are Dutch/French braids not cornrows get over it already can you not see it’s only two braids she’s not putting anything towards a culture so STOP COMPLAINING
That lipstick 😍 your lips are perfect!
Why is your skin so beautiful, can you do a skin care routine
um excuse me i need that sailor moon powder
ily!!!!!!!!!!  CAN YOU DO A HAIR TUTORIAL!
Her baby hairs ARE ON FLEEEEEEK
Is there any alternative lip colour that could be used? It's so pretty but I can't get it where I live
I don't necessarily know your still in videos but I love the way you go about makeup. Proms coming up and I'm very much so a beginner with makeup. I want to do my own so maybe a nice prom makeup tutorial?
wtf calm down they're just braids lmao
I have found my wife
This look reminded me of liane v
It's her hair meaning she can do whatever she wants with it. No matter how offended/unoffended you are by it. - end of story.
her lip was bleeding in the video
I got a Michelle Phan commercial. Dead.
The first song used in this video? T_T help.
Why is everyone worrying about cultural appropriation! Instead you sink in this bomb look!😕😊
who cares if she wears braids. lol. and if a non Muslim wants to wear a hijab just to try it out? who cares! why does everything have to be criticized?
Is your lips bleeding?? 🙊🙊
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER SHE USED TO BE ASIAN
No is like her she is very special
As a guy i got to say she looks good without make up but the make up is so interesting. Its like an art.   I can see how some women would get hyped up about it, its so creative. I'm glad we (men) don't have to deal with it but i can see it being something fun. Good video. Vietnamese girls seem like they have a great attitude. I got to go to Vietnam.

please, translate more make looks tutorials in spanish. please,  i love your channel. but i don`t speak very well english
dammn I love her ,  but I wish to see her in really glam make up like  nikkie tutorials 😢💔
Absolutely stunning
love this tutorial and the title!
These aren't even French braids. These are Dutch braids :x
You do not need other peoples permission or any reason to braid your hair, nor do you need to acknowledge anybody for it. Thanks.
OMG she is so pretty
I am watching michelle from her 1st tutorial and she is the best!i love her
her voice is calming
Rhett and Link's hilarious parody of this brought me here.
i love the false lashes! but the lashes don't look like the ones on amazon?? Please help??!
It's just BRAIDS
Wait is she still with Dom?
is your lip bleeding
Do you still have your hello kitty mirror
ok, I have to be completely honest, I've been watching your videos for years now! before there were 135467656645 beauty "gurus" on youtube...& I truly love yr videos & yr personality. the only thing that's bothering me is the amount of products you use now in yr videos. It honestly seems like yr trying to advertise as many products as possible, & I find myself questioning the integrity of yr videos; do u truly believe in these products & companies or are u just trying to make as much money as u can here on youtube. it's just such a huge difference compared to yr earlier videos...& do I really need to purchase & put 20+ products on my face for one look?! it doesn't seem very practical. please stay genuine.
You look pretty but the lip color is kind of ugly
Gorgeous!
CUTE
Vietnam Airlines needs this as their commercial!
Michelle's voice is really soothing, especially in this video. She should be a voice actor (like in that Marvel game) or record an audio book.
She has the most soothing voice
One thing I admire most about you is that you are extremely disciplined  within yourself. You seriously were born for this life.
Seriously why does this look like a movie trailer? Holy crap you're amazing
Jesus, this video is almost cinematographic
Why am I crying?
So inspired by how true and authentic you are💓
I honestly come back to this video whenever I need a sudden burst of inspiration. Thank you Michelle for continually inspiring me to work hard even if it feels like the world is melting.
Michelle do a Vietnamese inspired makeup tutorial in your ao dai! That would be awesome :)
This video was so beautiful
yas. I love Vietnam. what part did u visit
lol only if I had the money tho
"I look forward to a 2016 filled with videos" - makes 2 videos
Michelle, I know you're never going to read this but I want to talk to you about your channel. It seems as if, over the past year or two, that it has distanced from you as a person. We're seeing a lot of other people take over your videos, which is fine, but it's not really 'Michelle Phan' anymore. I love videos like this; I love your creativity, and God knows we all miss your makeup tutorials. We know you're getting busier by the minute, and branching out to fulfilling other dreams you may have. If you do come back to this channel (we haven't seen you in over a month) I'd love to see more of this creative vibe, and discussing spirituality like you begin to in this video, rather than putting out content that doesn't really seem personal to you. Love you always, Hettie xox
Is it weird that I teared up a little during this? I feel after all these years of watching your videso (+6 years) I really got to know your beautiful soul and I'm so happy that I did. Thank you so much, Michelle, for teaching me so much about more than just makeup. You inspire me day by day. Thank you, from the absolute bottom of my heart.
Who filmed and edited this!? Amazing!
Your culture is amazing I really wanna go there
this video is so relaxing and soothing along with your lovely voice
This is like Mulan and Tangled
aaah am I the only one happy to see Dom in this video? It's been a while since he was shown :D
absolutely breath taking how this video was shot! Beautiful and inspiring
Michelle you are so beautiful! I just found you and I subscribed
This girl really loves herself
OMG I from Vietnam to I wish I can go with you. My name Tong Uyen Nhi nice to meet you I like you so much!!!Welcome to Vietnam 🇻🇳!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
so breathtaking, well done to the camera work and editing!
inspired me so much. ♡
This is such a beautiful video.😭😭😭im not from vietnam but I almost cried watching this for some reason loll
this is exactly how i want my life to be omg!!!
I heard odesza and screamed
Damn the crew that film and edit this tho
I've always wanted to go to Vietnam. Since my whole family was born and raised there. I hope I have a chance to meet my family in person for the first time and explore the wonders of Vietnam.
Vietnam is so beautiful, man I wanna go there!!
She made 3 whole videos after this in 2016
This is so beautiful❤️
and this is why you are the queen of youtube Beauty Guru's!
This vid feels like home. To me tho.
Year. Vietnam is really amazing. Especially, Ha Long Bay, it's one of seven wonders of the world, or if you 'd like to explore an ancient city: Hoi An will be appropriate. Ha Noi is a capital of Vietnam, very incredible with the food names "bún chả" If you wanna visit beautiful beaches, you can travel to Nha Trang, Mui Ne, Vung Tau. Moreover if you wanna discover flowers' city, you should go to Da Lat. Or even you wanna find and feel some countrysides, you should go to Vinh Long in which has a lot of paddy fields and fruits such as rambutans, oranges, grapefruits, mangoes, or durians. Some foreigners said that they didn't like the strong smell of durians but I really love it. Now, I am studying in Can Tho, if you wanna visit this city, you can ask me, I am willing to introduce not only one city but also whole cities in Vietnam. I've been coming to Ninh Kieu Quay ( a tourist attraction in Can Tho in which have foreigners) to talk with them. I really love the friendly people from different countries. I love to shoot the breeze regardless sore throat :)) . Finally, If you like finding some foods in Vietnam, you can't ignore : Bún chả in Hà Nội, Bún Bò Huế ( Hue city), Phở ( almost everywhere), banh mi, bánh tét ( sticky rice cakes, especially often eat in Lunar New Year), bánh xèo ( a kind of special crepe),bánh tráng nướng ( grill rice paper),....
Regards
From Vietnam
She only made 4 videos this year
việt nam mình đẹp nhỉ
First of all amazing video! Second I was holding my breath to see Dom in this video because I wanted see if you were both still together. I'm so glad that you two are! 😍😍😍😍😘
I love your voice 😍💖
Hi Michelle. I have known you since 2007 and I followed you for several years. Then I stopped following you because I felt like you're drifting away from your original concept. There was a time that I was really disappointed that I even unsubscribed. But now I am back, and I'm not going to be one of the people who tells you that you've changed. Everyone changes. It is okay. It's not like you've changed for the worse. Your youtube might have changed but your aim is still to help the people around you. That's what you've always been doing. Thank you, Michelle.
This is like one of my fav video Always come bak to this ❤️❤️
I was replay many many this video. I love your Voice . 
<3
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING! 💖
Are you from south north of Central Vietnam and I am also Vietnamese
She should make ASMR videos! She'd make even more bank lol $$$$$
I don't know why but this video made me cry. Thank you for this Michelle. This is truly inspiring.
so beautiful. #respect.
her voice is so soothing I would love to hear her read a book 😍😍
YEAH BOIIIIIIIIIIII. I'm also Vietnamese, and it's nice to see someone I admire visit Vietnam. I've only been there twice in my life lel.
Oh my gosh I'm half Vietnamese too! I go there every few years. :)
What is the black dress/two piece she is wearing?? It’s beautiful
This video is very beautiful. Both filmed, directed and edited and the voiceover is so nice.
One of the most beautiful videos on YouTube
Flying to Vietnam tonight 😍 had to rewatch this ❤️
SOme people are simply luckier than others. Michelle Phan was one of the chosen ones, nothing more.
This video has gotten me excited for vietnam! I'm going in a month (I'm Vietnamese too)
sister: wow this woman is very inspiring and looks at life at a very innocent curious way..~☆
Me: ...
I'm gonna kidnap that black dress one day, fricken I want it
im so happy to see you still with your boyfriend! love love love you guys!
this is one of the most inspiring videos i have ever seen i cant wait till i go back to my motherland
Vietnam is beautiful
Is she from the north or south? I'm from the south!
Lol she just buys a thousand of those lantern candles
Love your work mish
Without thought, there is no thinker. 

Thought is the thinker herself.
this was just too " slick" for me....looked like Disney's Michelle Phan
I cried with this video. I felt so emotional to it
I liked and subbed because I love this video and I am Vietnamese too and I love my culture
It is my country, my proud😊.(maybe my grammar is wrong, sorry). 
 Love from Vietnam, your fan.
Beautiful BEAUTIFUL VIDEO <3 Thank you for making this video Michelle, it was amazing
this. is. so. beautiful.
I love Vietnam. It is beautiful.
I don't know why but this video make me cry
I think this is my favorite video on youtube. Everytime I watch it, I realise how much it's perfect, and it makes me wanna go in vietnam so so much. I wish one day I could .. 
I miss you but I understand why you left. 
ily
I know my culture is not from Korea or China but I would just love to explore ancient temples in China and Korea. The culture has me so interested and that's why I love Asian culture in my opinion their culture is my favorite.
OK guys, I'm packing my bags and going to a potato farm
thanks for representing vietnam in USA cause i'm vietnamese too
Hoi An, Tam Coc, Ho Chi Minh, Mekong; I love Vietnam! Where are you specifically from?
This is very beautiful I want to go to Vietnam next time
I’m doing it. I’m starting over. I need to do this and I’ve been putting this back for so long. I keep
Focusing on my past and my past mistakes. That’s not gonna help me! I have a purpose to create and inspire and I need to start over♥️
I feel sad watching this. I mean it's beautiful,but I think I feel sad because I know I can't go to these beautiful places.

I work in a warehouse, and I'm going through school, and it's what everybody is doing right now.

I don't know. It's a weir mix of jealousy, sadness, but also happy that Michelle gets to live such a magical life.

 At least someone gets to, y'know lol.
What flag is she is she the yellow one with red stripes or red one with a star in the middle cuz I am the yellow one with red stripes
Love this video, so beautiful xx Thanks for making it!
Her voice is so calming, the pictures and places are so beautiful and her story is amazing.
Respect!!!!
Your voice calms me dawn
Incredible. Inspiring. Love this so much.
ODESZAAAAAAA YUSSSS most calming, most uplifting music everrrr
i love this. thank you for inspiring me <3
I swear...i'm crying!! Thank you so much, you are a beautiful person ❤
Your voice is so calming😌 makes me relax💕
DAMN this video and all of her videos are so well made!!!
This made me cry. Thank you. I feel like all my questions have been answered.
Really impressed with beautiful video shot angles. M.P is real nice!
Thanks for sharing this lovely, nice vid.
i miss you baby phan ❣️
Vietnam is a beautiful place and at night is lovely ♥ but its just the stealing and stuff also my background its Vietnamese ^-^
This was absolutely beautiful. Not just to watch, but to experience. Thank you for showing us a glimpse into your glowing life.
This is beautiful, Michelle tells the best stories! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
YAS MICHELLE. NEW FAVORITE.
Your video always goals😍😭😭
I live in Paris, but I have a half vietnamese and a half french .... I really love your videos and how you represent our country ( Vietnam ) .
Love you and I hope to see you one time...
I watch this vid when I need a bit of inspiration
Wow this made me cry! So inspiring ❤
I cracked up at 2.50😂😂
omg it's absolutely looks like Indonesia!!!

🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 for southeast asia's sister
Wow this is so beautiful. Maybe i will experience my own life. And what it means. Every word has a meaning. Every talent has a gift. And everywhere you go, will lead to a beautiful land where love and friendship lives. And they are waiting for us. With our name on it. And they want us to reach our dreams. And turn them into a reality. Everyone has an imagination. Has an inspiration. And i want to thank all of the people around this world. I want to thank 7 billion of you. And Michelle Phan (Cuz, my name is also Michelle), For inspiring me to reach my dream and fulfill my wishes and make them into a reality and a dream come true. 
OMFG
IM FROM VIETNAM TOO!
but i was born in Australia
Your videos are great but I really miss the old you and how your videos were back then. I get it, new technology and editing softwares but it doesn't seem like you yknow ? Forever adore your hard work !
Why would people dislike this button? ;-;
Vietnam ish beauty 
I am Vietnam 🇻🇳
I LOVE U MICHELLE & YES ODESZA IS EVERYTHING!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING & INSPIRING BY BEING YOU :D
Amazing video. Words of truth & wisdom! Thank you for capturing such a gorgeous place.
You are a delightful human. Thank you for sharing your soul with the world. I am so grateful for you! 
Love and peace,
Haley Rose
Never recognize how my Vietnam so beautiful until ur video <3
LOVE U <3 Love your smooth voice too
Wow, I can't get over how beautiful this video is.Pure art and so inspiring <3
I see some of you are putting her work down or dismissing her beautiful message because the say she is not Christian. I know alot of "Christian" people that aren't connected to God . You can be connected to God without claiming a religious denomination. You just have to be a good person, with kind heart. The Universe is God and God is the Universe. So who are you to judge on Michelle's relationship with God? Each relationship is personal and private. People, leave the judging to God. This girl is not perfect- neither are you. Great job + Michelle Phan...
.love & light
Wow! I feel inspired. Great footage too! Amazing!
this is sooo beautiful and powerful! thank you':)
You are vietnamese and I also
Beautifully done :) Thank you for the inspiration 😘
omg im so happy to see dom.
This woman always giving me goosebumps! ❤️
Vietnam in my heart. ❤❤❤
people learn from each other u represent it love
I am Saadia Akhtar
this was very beautiful and inspiring 💫 I especially loved the music and montage at the end! makes me want to travel to Vietnam!! 💕
I finally found a Vietnamese you tuber lol ! Vietnam is beautiful I'm so glad I went are you in Saigon?
I can't even count how many times I watched this video 😍💥
I think that you love more yourself then Vientam and others places on Earth. It can to see on your videos. Almost all moments from your videos have you but as we can see you try to say us something about beautiful places and nature. Let's be honestly with us, you're wonna show yourself to us but don't to show about what you're talking. Yes, you can to say that i envy to you. But there is a lot of people who try too to show in themself videos about county and beautiful places and i don't have an envy for it.
Omg so happy to see you and Dom, haven't seen him in a vid in ages haha 
Vietnamese fans always love you. Good luck!!!
OMG i freaking LOVE Odesza! Awesome that you're promoting them! Great video, you seem so humble :)
I am Vietnamese as well!
I love your channel. You are so inspiring
you're videos are so aesthetic.love them ♡♡♡♡.
This might sound weird, but your video inspired me to get rid of all the unnecessary things I have in my life:  today I donated my old clothes, I took out 4 bags of stuff I didn't need at home and, the most important thing for me, I finally let go the toxic people I had in my life. I was hurt by someone, but I still had his family on my social media. Today he became a father and all facebook was full of pictures of him, which reminded me all the pain he made me feel. Today I politely talked to his family and permanently deleted them from my social media, in order to cleanse my social life and erase all that pain forever. I wonder why I didn't do this before.

God, that was so hard. But thank you for such inspiring view of life. I can't wait to see what mine has to offer, now that I walk my path weight-free.
U R LITERALLY ONE OF MY BIGGEST INSPIRATIONS
This makes me inspired❤️😍
Michelle Phan! The queen of all youtubers ❤❤❤
i thought Michelle's a Christian?
edit: though i'm not sure where I got that impression/idea
yeah except I'm broke as hell
This is beautiful, I love you Michelle.
that was so beautiful, i cried
Gorgeous video and message! Love this!
Damn this f channel all cinematic / MV like I'm dead 😂 I actually like it It's Lit

THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING
Michelle, thank you for always inspiring me.
This is so beautiful! As a White Person* I don't really have a culture besides Basic American Culture* and I've always found it very interesting and beautiful that people have a heritage and a history. Great video!
love you Michelle <3
Truly amazing!
This was truly an awakening moment for me
Inspiring as always. ;)

It's amazing how much we take life for granted. I'm sure we all know the feeling of wasted time. Wherever you are, whoever you are,

Don't die without purpose!
Uh, I want one Ao Dai 😍 I love Vietnam :)  Dear vietnamese friends, would be nice if I wear this? (I'm Colombian)
I wanna travel to Asia it seems so beautiful and lively there
This is so incredible! I'm also from Vietnam and I've been there a few times, but I've never thought like that. Now I now what I'm going to do next time(; 
Thanks(:

I watch this video often to find my inspiration in you.
Thankyou, Michelle. I hope that all your positive thoughts turn into reality.
You had been my inspiration
I'm Vietnamese , love u girl <3
This like a travel commercial for Vietnam
I can't wait until I have a DNA test, my roots really intrigate me
Idk some places you've been in the video are simular to where I went before

"There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path." - Michelle Phan
This is so beautiful holy hell
>Drinks one glass of water and watches one Michelle Phan video
>Ok, detox done
Xin chào chị!! I'm from Vietnam
I love you so much <3
Michelle! I have watched your videos since i started being interested in makeup - and the start of your whole career! I have watched you grown into a wonderful, inspiring and talented woman for years. You are the reason i became interested in make-up - and i also think you are apart of what helped me grow as a person too. Always remain humble and inspiring and remember you are doing positive and amazing things for people. Sending love from New Zealand! xxx
so positivity and full inspiring❤
I feel like a lot of us really want to explore our own culture but can't afford it. It would be nice to go to the country or place that we came from but I really can't because of money. Does anyone else feel that we should be able to do what we want without worrying about money?
This was an amazing video. So inspiring Michelle...
Love this video. We all have to follow our own journey no matter what. Thank you for inspiring us Michelle. ❤🙏🏼🇨🇦🌎🇵🇭
This has become my favorite video! Probably your best work! It fills me with such calm, and desire to adventure out and enjoy my life. And especially the bit with Dom, that was so cute, so glad you guys are still together! Forever inspired by you! ❤️
Amazing <3.

I watch this video minimum of once a week; especially when I'm down. After this video; I go out for  a long walk. I Observe everything and everybody"s beauty and then I come home with an opened mind. I love this video it keeps me on my path to happiness <3
Incredible woman, I love you voice, you give me a little bit more inspiration
"If you can think it, believe it."

My family is from Vietnam 🇻🇳
Dear Michelle, this Video made me cry.. the things you said about being grateful for our lifes and our friends hit my emotions, I want to appreciate that much more too. Thank you for this beautiful Video. Good luck on your journey! <3
this video is the most inspirational thing ever <3
I like how u don't wear as much makeup in these, your naturaal
Does anyone know where in Vietnam this is? My family is planning a trip and I really want to visit here.
This is so beautiful and inspiring. Yes Michelle. You did inspire me. You inspired me to feel things on a more spiritual side. To be more open-minded. I will always follow your journey for that extra inspiration in myself. Thank you for the lesson. <3
I'm graduating Saturday and this video made me realize how real this all is. It gave me the motivation I needed.
Still watching this in 2018 and will forever rewatch this in the future. Thank you, Michelle.

This is so beautiful omg
I love your voice! You really gorgeous just the way you're. Our country VietNam is so beautiful <3
this was fantastic. thanks for sharing :)
Remember years ago when she used to post makeup tutorials frequently? Pepperidge farm remembers. 

Not that this isn't a great quality video , because it definitely is.  Idk , I miss the makeup tutorials and such. She's the first beauty guru I ever subscribed to and this channel isn't anything like how it used to be . Again like I said , not complaining ! This video was awesome .But I do miss it . Anyone else ?
Ooh i wish she started vlog channel 😩😩🤔
I cried... I found my answer. Thank you.
The production value...
beautiful ❤
"There's a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path."
<3 đẹp quá
So damn DOPE!!
we shouldn't forget our own roots and I am always being proud of my ethnicity, thank u for making me more inspired to work for the people I need to do in the future, hopefully u will have a great year in 2017 ahead.
You have such a beautiful soul. Please come back 💓
I don't get the negative comments on this video, it's so unnecessary. It was a beautiful video with no ill intention at all (no endorsements, no ads, nothing) and has a genuine message so just enjoy the video and stop being such a Debbie Downer. I just found out about Michelle Phan through this video without having any prior thoughts about her and I teared up at how gorgeous this was.
ok wow  <3 <3 <3 love this
This makes me want to go back to my hometown :'(
may i say u look like jessica alba? :D
you inspire me!
I def reflect these thoughts and feelings of our world but you communicate it so well its beautiful and inspiring, you didnt have to make this video but you did and I think thats amazing! You're so talented! ♡
i am vietnamese too
Incredible video, you are so inspiring! I have just discovered your channel andI love it already. I have Vietnamese origins too.
I love this video so much! Thank you Michelle for making this beautiful piece of art :*
i wonder who filmed this

Beautiful video. I can feel your evolving with so much loving energy. All the best to you and your loved ones Michelle.
I just went to Vietnam recently and I'm looking back at this video, and I'm just like "OMG I WENT THERE!"
Loved the video it inspired me!❤️ I am 12 years old but I used to watch your videos since 2011
The makeup tutorials 💗💗💗 your amazing!
I appreciate the time taken for editing and filming this video! So beautiful!
<3 this thank you

Captivating


We go to sleep in one world

Only - to wake in the other one
Which - is the real one…?

We must follow our heart
Make choices
Which - will determine our destiny

Her videos always give me goosebumps and make me wanna cry but in a good way 😹😻💓💕

what camera and lens did you use you should put it in the description box
I miss these videos ! Where have you been ;(
I just came back home from Vietnam😱Also I am Vietnamese too!!!!!!!
one of the best Youtube video I've ever seen
When I saw Dom I screamed "DOM! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!"
Do You Remember What To He Is?
Hello,Michelle iam also from Viet Nam,when i watch your video feel like fimiliar ,i am your fannnnn <3 <3 <3 <3
Can i have a question,how old are you and do you know Bethany Mota ??
Thank you so much!!
I ment angel the blue wolf
Thank you Michelle, for that meaningful and breathtaking piece of art. It inspired me a lot, on my coming journey to find my self and beeing brave to face new adventures wich are upcoming in my life ♥️ i am really thankful for this inspirational video of you ♥️
2:30 Dom was with you! (= How beautiful! <33
Michelle your such a beautiful soul . I want to thank you for being you and I know you'll get through the tough times your having
Beautiful! 😭😭😭
you can hear her smile and it's so cute
i love you thak for everything I from Vietnamese
I want to go to Vietnam so bad after this!!
omg, she is so pretty 😍😍
I wish you come back Michelle. We miss amazing person like you ❤️
Michelle, this video touched me so much, thank you.
Michelle you should do a collaboration with cutiepiemarzia
Opinion: I honestly wish more people were like this. Reconnecting with who they are especially culturally or going back to your roots. Like how Michelle went to Vietnam, not saying people should hop on planes and go out there to better understand themselves, but like in any way possible know your self better. I say this because I know I see people around, the same race, and same ethnicity, ect but i as I look closer I see a more different them. They're not themselves, they're different people, I just know it.. Yeah Ik be free to be what you want to be boo boo but sometimes they forget where their roots came from. There's this temple where usually people go every Saturday, mostly ederly, and usually many people come celebrate Lao New Years there. We have a decent population here, however less than 20 come, where are the younger generations? I see your Instagram profile? You all list your race, ethnicity, flag but how well do you know it? What if I told you that isn't the actual flag of the country? Do you know the story behind it? Do you know yourself?

Opinion^^^ 
OH EM GEE DOM
I just wow everything about her videos is perfect. 
Michelleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 😭❤️
Love youuuuu❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was born there.it was soooo fun grow up there but I move to the U.S.
Việt Nam điểm danh phát xem nào

Absolutely love this video diary <3
I love how Michelle has gone from Beauty Guru to actual Guru.
I am a graphic desinger student and this video really inspires me. with life but also creatively. I love the way you filmd this and the style of the video. I know you're gone for now, but still your videos inspire me the most. Miss you but I know you know what your doing take your time this fan will wait ! ☺️
I wish I had someone to follow me around and record amazing footage of me too. 
But sadly, there are none
BEAUTIFUL!
it is because of this video that i am a hardcore Odesza fan, i watched this years ago and soon i started listening to their new albums
388 views... i guess I'll never be part of the 301 club
I LOVE YOU. I'm from Viet Nam. i have followed you for many years. Good luck to you. Hope you always strong like a way any Vietnamese live
I'm Vietnamese just like you Michelle and my mom was born in Vietnam
if I believe hard enough, you'll eventually end up sitting on my face?
Easy for u to say
Good job at romanticizing the poverty of real lived spaces in Vietnam. Yes. Everything is cherry and roses and spiritual when u have money.
Michelle... Thank u so much...😊I love u...❤
So Powerful and Wonderful.. This is Life indeed I'm spiritual and I like this spiritual take on things
I care about Vietnam more than anything cause that's where I come from
I can't explain how much this video means to me
Her voice is so soothing...😌
How can I speak more like her?

#videogoals
The beauty in this video made my heart ache with happiness and wanderlust. I'm so happy for you, Michelle 💜
#videogoals
Michelle I love you so much and miss you so dearly, you have truly been an inspiration to me for such a long time. You are how I started growing my passion for makeup. You inspire me to be creative, proud, happy with life no matter what it is like, that I'm always glamorous, and that you need to connect with your inner beauty to be really, truly, beautiful inside and out. Thank you so much for all you have done for me. I hope your self journey is going well and you are smiling everyday.
Michelle u are so lucky 😊
She is so inspirational. I love it.
this video gives me life
I swear your videos raise the bar for these YT people who don't edit whatsoever. Phenomenal Michelle. Art.
your voice is soothing michelle <3
VietNam is beatiful ( i'm from VietNam)
Just what I needed :)
Watching this in 2017. I'm lost.
Your voice is so beautiful. Love this video so much;)
What video editor are you utilizing?
You're such an inspiration :)
This video was so gorgeous. Wonderfully done!
I'm Vietnamese!!
This was probably the most inspirational and touching video for me in a few years. The past year, I've been wondering who I am and what I want to be. In order to realize who I am, I think it's important to know where you came from and what shaped you the way you are now. You've inspired me to take action. Figure out where I came from, who I am. And by doing that I know where I want to be in life. Thank you. Would love to see more like this from you!
Omg did u guys see the kid blowing fire 😮😮😮😮😮😮 go Vietnam 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳💯
I really love your cute voice
Michelle I know you already know, but you're such an inspiration for the Vietnamese community!
xin chao,Michelle
Can you speak a lot of Viet?
I really wish I could go back and explore my roots. Being a Black-American, the farthest back I could trace was a South Carolina plantation. Luckily, I've learned to love my Black American culture and I've began to love jazz, hip-hop, styles of dance, black literature, gospel, soul food, and much more. It's all about perspective.
Are Michelle and Dom still dating?!?😟😟😟
One of my favourites videos on the internet <3
welcome to VietNam, this is video beautiful
Amazing as always 💗
I got mad because i just miss my older sister Mich cause she's been so gone in Youtube then i watched this. I still love her I knew it.
0:55 I think I went there omfg
WHY are you all complaining about her not making more videos.
LITTERALY nobody is concerned about her health?
Maybe is isn't feeling well and wants to take a break. What is wrong with you? If you are a true fan, can't you try to put yourself in her shoes? Ask yourself why she isn't making videos. maybe she is busy, maybe family problems, maybe she wants to take a break because of exhaustion? 
She is human aswell like we all. Just try to not only ask but also to give and to show some love and caring.

Just think a bit before judging and give this girl a break.

peace.
She is a great story teller...very talented girl 👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤
OMG thanks for come to Vietnam! I wanna meet you but I live in Ho Chi Minh city 
I love ur new video.... I want you to see this positive message but not in that nasty comment section.. its unbelievable how people are quick to judge without knowing like you said money doesn't buy happiness but living life brings you happiness.... and that's what they will never understand.. because how it happened to you it can happen to them if they work as hard as you did... but the question is would they be happy .... I think not ... girl keep doing what your doing and I hope to see more.of u and ur art soon ....
Can u start a vlog chanle plz
Looks so cute!!
Do a Boyfriend Q&A
this video is breath taking ... i had to watch it again as soon as it ended 
thank you for sharing your thoughts in such a beautiful way..so gentle and yet so powerful
this is better than watching celebrity gossip news
Her voice makes me go sleep!!❤
can you speak vietnamese ? :)
beautiful ... that's all I can say
your video is 100 times better than Vietnam Airline's promotion video.  breathtaking
This vid made me want to go to Vietnam 😂👍
اللي جاي من نور ستارز لايك😂😂
Sounds like Michelle got into new age! 😔
Omg I really want to make an edit of this <3
how are you soooo gorgeous ???!!!

I loved this video <3
You guys still together? thanks god I thought you broke up
This video is probably one of my favorites from your channel. You captured Vietnam in such a way that the mundane and extraordinary mix in such a beautiful way. The music score, your narrative fits in so perfectly it just hits me in the right moments. Thanks again Michelle! Your content continues to feed my soul.
This video deserves more views
I WANNA GO THERE ITS MY DREAM PLACE Where I'm from is Manila sounds like vanilla🙂

Beautiful video
That was really inspirational and beautiful
i always find myself coming back to this video
This video is so inspiring!
+Michelle Phan There's one thing that bothers me in this video. It's prohibited to wear revealing clothes while greeting Buddha or other sacred figures (the part with bowing down with incense sticks). ^^' It's important to cover your upperarms, chest area and legs when greeting them.
vieeetnam is so beautiful
Cảm ơn chị đã mang một Việt Nam xinh đẹp đến bạn bè trên thế giới !! <3 <3 <3
Can you speak Vietnamese😚,I'm Vietnamese
MY mother land is Vietnam!
Michelle!!!!!! You took my breathe away and inspired the crap out of me. Thank you so very much for this beyond amazing video! As a Vietnamese who was born and raised in Saigon myself, I couldn't be more proud of you, you made tear up, honestly! I bow down to you the real QUEEN! Slayed the existence out of Youtube!

BEAUTIFUL❤
What if the universe is like sharp jagged rocks trying to crush you at any opportunity  it gets in life,maybe that was the universe trying to make you stronger preparing you for life and what lies ahead,like if u got fired or dumped it will only make u stronger.
I am from Vietnam I love pho
I dont get why people say "Michelle has changed" or "I miss the old Michelle" , just because she has branched out and makes other types of videos doesn't mean anything , she still makes tutorials but not JUST tutorials which is why I watch her videos as a guy and Im not ashamed one bit . Michelle is filled with so much wisdom and advise , let's let her share that wisdom .
PHAN
So epic & inspirational! Massive thanks, Michelle! You're a lovely soul! Big love from CH!
I love her aó dài
Feel like i was there in Vietnam with you haha. This was the best video ever and so much inspo
i know it’s hard to believe the coincidence but i was just struggling witch choosing what i want to study for my bachelor year at university and  lately i’ve been constantly stuck between 2 courses! The hard part is that once i choose this course i’ll have to stick with it for the rest of my college years and it will influence my career opportunities in the future so this makes the choice even harder,, but after seeing this video i think i should just go with the flow and choose what i’m more attracted by. Thank you Michelle♥️
Her voice is so calming and soothing. And her words are so poetic and deep
I am a Vietnamese too!
in love with this video
WAW !!!
She's over there exploring Vietnam and I'm over her stressing that the zika virus don't come were I live at

I miss the bubbly Michelle her old celebrity transformations and perfect makeup tutorials #IwantbubblyMichelleback
loovee this <3
I was having a horrible night until I realized I can turn myself around and I saw your video which made me even more inspired.  Thank you! Just what I needed :)
I've been following Michelle Phan since her xanga days aka RiceBunny days.. and she was always drawn to art.. always uploaded her paintings done graphically or in real-life... But then her makeup videos really took a hit at the same time Youtube and the makeup industry took off so she was in the makeup industry for a while.. and now it seems like she's back to being a graphic artist/author for a fantasy story! Good for her.
that's how good you make me proud of you and my beautiful country - Vietnam
She needs to make a book of her life and btw she is a great writer
R U VIETANAMESE?!?!!?!? :DDDD if ur are ur SOOO pretty :0
halfway in the video i realized this is what i want to do/be when i grow up. i want to travel the world and find myself.. find out who I am. but then i remember i have school and college to stress about :/
Great production value and nice content. Beautiful!
Her voice 😭 it's so freaking beautiful and soothing! Ugh, she should do audio books 😍
việt nam rất đẹp chị nhỉ
Love you Michelle!
hey i live in vietnam
love this video
Amazing video! hello to all youtubers
Đẹp quá
Oh this brings me back memories, what I love about Vietnam is, mostly if you come from the farm lands and live a CRRRRRAZY distant from everyone, the people, besides your family that are closest to you, are your family. I still remember walking down that hot dusty day, with the sounds of birds and the smell of mud water as I walked next to the beds of the rice beds. Once and a while I would hear a motorcycle run by and we would wave at each other. As I would walk, I would greet people, elder or baby as I walked by their houses, surrounded by a gate wall. As I touched the gate wall, I would reach my grandma's house and the one thing I would do once I got home, was to drink that angel milk we bought at the super market, I forgot what it was called, but she would give it to me when I couldn't be able to sleep. Then the next morning, I would wake up, put on clothes I don't wear anymore and run out of the house with my boots can gloves. With my bamboo hat and my basket.
Nise💖
vietnam is beautiful
you are in Vietnam oh my godddddd
+Michelle Phan can you give vietnamese lessons if you know vietnamese.I wish I can speak vietnamese and learn my ancestors culture
This was magical, Michelle! <3 Beautifully filmed/edited and I love the message. I have the same beliefs as you. I'm so excited for you, you're so driven and you've had such an amazing life because you believe in yourself and you make things happen. Can't wait to see you again...might be moving to LA, coming over next week for a test drive, EEP! HUGE huge hug! x
i love VietNam
Please make a video soon!!!
is her Asian idk
Dear michelle, 
 I don't know if you would even read this. I doubt that this woukd get lost amongst thousands of comments in this section. But if you are reading this Michelle, I just want to tell you that we all love you very very much. You have been gone from YouTube for almost 6 months now and we know there is certainly a reson behind that. And now I see that lots of your videos are missing and your profile picture in Instagram, YouTube.... they have been changed to black.We don't exactly know if that symbolises a lack of inspiration or you are probably going through something that you don't want to tell right now. We respect your privacy michelle...we will always respect that. Take all the time you want mish and come back stronger than ever. You are an inspiration Michelle... to thousands of us out here and you will continue to be that inspiration. You are a guider, a tutor, a fighter, a sweetheart... and for me, a big sister as well. So, even if you are going through some "dark times", just know that we are always here and you can share anything with us and we promise to listen and understand. Sending you all the love and good vibes.
always your little sister,Rosy
Michelle Phan is the Beyoncé of Youtube
Personally, I'm not French or anything but the thought of going to France has always fascinated me, since I'm latina we have a quince's which is celebrating you becoming a young aspiring lady turning 15. Tradition is you wear a grand dress and throw a killer party but I decided to bend the rules so instead of a party I go to Europe for 2 weeks, she agreed and I'm going in the summer. I'm so grateful for the opportunity I've been given, I'm incredibly blessed.
I landed on your "why I left " video randomly after watching a beauty video made by your sister in law .  I found your story and animation amazing and coming from an immigrant background myself I can understand the pressure of expectation and trying to reconcile yourself and your background. I am glad that you are reconnecting with yourself and your roots.  Hoping to do the same when I return to my birth nation this year.  Happy travels and  Thank you for putting your voice out there.
Her voice is so calm and spiritual! Loved it 💚
vietnam <3
Viet Nam :)
Love it!
I wonder how she feels about the communist, human rights oppressing regime ?
Can you send me mp3 link please? Your voice is really warm and i want to listen to it more and more.
Never mind
Yay u live in Vietnam  😃
Michelle, I am Vietnamese too! I will prove it by spelling a word in Vietnam ,xín Chou
Your going to hell. Jesús is Lord.

This will always be my favorite video by her
How can someone hate  this

and dove cameron popular artist
"just like a river there's different paths you can explore. choose the one you feel drawn to" i honestly feel super inspired. everything about the video is beautiful. both rual and ubarn side of vietnam. this year i've been really embracing my culture and where i'm from and is genuinely one of the best feelings ever
I think it's imp to remember that ur inferior to the creator, that this life Is a test nd to remember our purpose in life...then we hve nothing to be depressed about... hopefully
im in vietnam rn, i visit it every year💘
im in vietnam rn, i visit it every year💘
Oh i'm in Vietnamese.
i hope sometimes you speak vietnamnese <3
Yes, your new chapter, new you. Love the way you accumulate all the little but best ever of Vietnamese to put they all in this video. Great video ever! Love you! You make me so proud of being a Vietnamese!
I'm from Vietnam, thank you very much
What happened to her? She's been MIA for a while now.
This made me cry..
The filming you do and the editing is so amazing. There are some graphic editors that could do with a leaf out of your book. Thank you so much for not using Comic Sans.
What a beautiful video michelle
That video you film in Viet Nam...
Beautiful video, would loooove to visit Vietnam ! Also : the black dress Mish is wearing, where is it from ??
💖
this is why michelle phan is one of my role models. she seeks the unexplored, revels in the unknown, and strives to always be a better person. watching her videos encourages me to work hard to fulfill my dreams.
I went to Vietnam I wished I went where you did but I couldn't I went to vinpearl I am really good at Vietnamese  even though I was born in america
Viet Nam🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
Wait did you shoot all those scenes around the world to do this video?
OMG, tuyệt quá chị làm em yêu Việt Nam vô cùng
And why am i feel like crying?
VietNamis
I am in love
She was at Hue because I was there
This video is definitely motivation to get out and explore and learn about one's roots and culture.
Thank you so much like you did so much for us these videos can save so many people from putting their life to an end
can you like record meditations and put them on the internet? i love the things you have to say and your voice is really soothing. I would totally listen to them!!!!
this is so inspiring, i was born in oregon, and i will always be tied to its green rolling hills and old oaks. but part of me just has too much wanderlust. i havent seen enough. even with all my travels....
<3 Việt Nam hiện lên trong khung hình của chị đẹp quá. Em luôn ngưỡng mộ chị, cảm ơn chị vì đã luôn truyền cảm hứng cho em, chị là Người Thầy đầu tiên dạy em makeup ạ 
P/S: You and your boyfriend looks amazing together, you must have had so much fun learning to drive motorbike in Vietnam.
So, Michelle is vietnamnese?
I love you so bad 😘😍😍😍
I love Vietnam ! :)
make a vid with promise phan
This inspire me i thought i wasn't powerful and i thought i couldn't realize who i am. But the fact that you can figure out who you are is a big inspiration. thanks :)  -Marina
u look like a old lady
Hello Michelle, this inspired me to move forward even with doubt or shame. I promise I will take my personal legend. Thank you!
Thank you, Michelle Phan.
Gosh, do you mind to list the place you have traveled in Vietnam? I would love to go there too!!
love your video so much
#vietnamsquad
chị là người Việt Nam à?
nhìn chị giống người Việt quá☺
Soooo beautiful almost cryed
The cinematography for this video was absolutely stunning. I remember the first time I visited Taiwan, where my dad came from, everything was so different then the way it was here in America. The people, the culture, everything was so..unique and had an indescribable beauty to it..I feel like here in America, we idolize a lot of superficial things and many countries look at us as a country of wealth, and so when I went to Taiwan and other places in China, though the people weren't wealthy they were so happy. And it just inspired me so much to look at the world in a different way.
This video is a true inspiration.
Đà Nẵng city
Her voice reminds me so much of katara!! (Avatar)
You are praying to the wrong gods.
Peace & silence!
It is hoi an ????
Người Việt Nam
Welcome to my country! But you know, when you go to the church in Vietnam, you shoudnt wear short clothes or revealing clothes. Thats not suit here =)
Beautiful video Michelle.  Great inspiration for my videos.  Love the use of colors in your videos!
I LOVE HOW HER VIDEOS ARE SO PROFESSIONAL AND BEAUTIFUL LIKE HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

Cám ơn Michelle <3
I went back to Vietnam this year. It was amazing to experience my motherland's beauty. I miss it so much even though it wasn't all pure air and clear stuff and there was a lot of motorcycles and pollution, it was still amazing and beautiful. I miss it so much

Who's come from Vietnam 😬😀
I watched this video while I was in Vietnam!
I am from Vietnam
That time were she says, that there is a difference in knowing the path and walking the path, should be really inspiring, but I'm just laying here and not knowing what the hell to do with my life
I cried watching this video. The fact that I won’t see all the beautiful nature this world has to offer in my  lifetime makes me so sad
I'm Vietnamese
I go there every year
What country are you from
Video rất đẹp !!! Cảm ơn bạn ~
why we dont see anymore all that often photos or videos with you and Dom?
I m very proud of Vietnam. My country. Your country. Our country
I LOVE YOU VIETNAM
life is about growth and evolving! shout out to you
I'm from Vietnam!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!
Wanna travel to Vietnam right now! This fall I'm going to travel to Indonesia. My mother's homeland. I think it's so important for multiethical people to experience both of the cultures (or if there are more, all of them) !!
I feel like you could be a Disney princess

I'm going to Vietnam this year. I hope someone can tell me which part of Vietnam Michelle visited on this video. I just see Hoi An (I hope i'm not miss spelling it). Thankyou so much :))
her voice is so soothing it relaxes me...
I miss Vietnam
What camera and equipment did you use to make this?
Always good to hear what Michelle's has been doing. Yes, her voice is so soothing. The best always to Michelle
I LOVE THIS VIDEO! It takes me away from reality and reminds me of the time when I went back to the country where I came from.  Her voice is so soothing and the edit is amazing!  The scenery and the shots are just breathless.  I love love love this video!!
To the 1k+ who dislike...screw u
Everthing she's doing is so aesthetic
At the end of my river is a waterfall. At the end of the waterfall is deadly, jagged rocks.
You just uploaded this video in my birthday.
Thank you very much for the inspiration
I really love you u look Great ❤️❤️❤️
I'm also viet and I'm touched to see the video created :)
it is peaceful, it is my hometown.
Absolutely amazing video. I am stunned and almost in tears of joy and confusion. I feel that I must travel and experience my roots as well to understand myself and where I am from. I have always been petrified of traveling alone, but maybe this is finally the year I'll do it (: thanks for inspiring me for years Michelle !
Is this in the south? I was there at the markets at 1:42 not too long ago
I love this video

This is such a calming video
Why dont u make video like thiss, your voice is really good😍
I am only 12 years old
Chị là người Việt phải không ?
Michelle's voice, both the sound of it and what she has to tell us, are gifts from somewhere just past the veil of reality. We're so lucky we can hear it  ♥

I love hoi an city! The atmosphere is completely beautiful,it's great to learn about your heritage and roots expecially when you live in a country like the USA or Canada. It's important to have bonds with your heritage and learn about it. Thank you Michelle Pham for being such a great role model! I will take your experience as a guide to life and my potential career when I'm older and still in the process of learning about me as a person in this life.
3:34 what top is Michelle wearing?

This video is so inspiring
I miss her so much :(( watching this video makes me wanna cry.

Beautiful ⭐️
where's this place?
Could someone please tell me the name of this music ?!
hay  đấy chị có thể  làm video nói tiếng việt được không
I'd love to but I have no money
Is Michelle still going out with the French guy?
Where have she gone all this year
Does anyone know what camera was used for this? Or her other travel vlogs? I am going overseas soon and I want to vlog my travels!
I was crying about some stupid thing with my health (irrelevant). Watching your video kind of made me more calm. I want to grow to find my path or where i'm supposed to walk. You were what made me mature. :)
wow, this video really meant alot to me. I've been having a hard time these past few days and I just want to find myself and change my ways. I don't want to live my life like how I used to. I want there to be a spark. I want to let go of all the sad memories. this video made me smile and make me think about the great things I can do. thank you so much!!
I come back to this video from time to time. It inspires me. It gives me the gentle but needed nudge to bump me back onto my path when I stray from it. Thank you Michelle. I miss your videos loads!
beautiful dresses
sao ko thay comen tieng viet.
gosh it is my dear vietnam
Vietnam looks so fun! I need to go to the motherland as well!
She reminds me of Jessica Alba @@
As you have your own story you also have the will or ability to write every chapter and page, making your own directions. That's something that should always be remembered, right?
love VietNam. VietNam beatiful
Love the nón la.  😊

I want to go to Vietnam to meet some of my aunts and to see where my mom grew up.  She wanted to take me and stay for two weeks, but her oncologist advised against it because she couldn't be without chemo for that long.  Unfortunately, she passed away before being able to take that trip.  But at least she still got to go to Vietnam one last time, for my uncle here in the States brought her ashes back to where they grew up.
To everyone who thinks they can't trace their roots because they're from a combination of different European or African countries - don't worry, if you do a DNA test (about $100 at 23&me or ancestry . com, but worth it), you can find out what countries your ancestors were from, and then you can do research on these countries - and you'll find that each one has a distinct and fascinating culture and history! So don't feel like you have no roots because you're just an "average" white or black person - you're a unique blend, and you DO have a background and probably multiple motherlands! :) You're special! Beautiful video, btw, Michelle
yes
Nhờ chị em mới để ý việt nam xinh đẹp không thua gì nước khác
vietnameseeeee!!!!!! here
lovely.
Too bad African Americans don't know their true origin.the continent Africa is to vague.
Can somebody tell me what part of Vietnam this is? Hanoi?
viet nam 😍😍😍 well come
I love vietnam
i wish i was born from a country that has such great meaning and culture, like India or china or even Ethiopia with the great kings and queens background , my culture is just plain.. well boring.
Were you in Vietnam because it looks like it and the under ground temple looked cool
I love Vietnam people are so sweet over there.
love it
She really knows how to keep people see her video!
Well...  My mom is Scottish and my dad is half white and black and adopted...  I can't quite connect to this type of find out who I am through heritage video lol...  I'm is CA and this is kind of...  It  haha.  I guess I'll go to Scotland and chill with my family's clan or live vicariously through my Filipino husband haha...
We have the same culture.
VIETNAM😍😍😍
Beautiful!! 🌹 But poor lobsters at the end 😐

JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TRUTH AND LIFE THE ONLY WAY  TO THE FATHER
I love vietnam

One word: AMAZING

Vietnam , my country
u are wearing áo dài
is she a combodien?
So much occultism in this new "spirituality", in that there is this belief that we are one with the universe and that we will be fine with whatever we choose to believe and embrace. Although seemingly comforting, it is satanic people. 

There's over 4,000 religious faiths in the world, yet there's only ONE Savior given for mankind! His name is JESUS, the King of kings and Lord of lords!!

Isaiah  Acts 
I can't wait to go to Vietnam! Can anybody please help with naming the places she goes to, what she eats? :) x
Can you speak vietnamese
it's Vietnamese 😀
This video is therapeutic 😩♥️
She is buddahism right?
:')
I miss you so much
1:48
Your voice is enchanting.
Is a vietnam ?
cảnh này hình như ở việt nam
she wears beautiful ao dai too
I come back to this video at least once a year. It inspires me so much !
Em người Việt Nam. Tự hào quá Việt Nam ơi!!!
I born in Vietnam and it more beautiful than I expected
I am Vietnamese no lies
I'm so glad I found you again Michelle! I'm also glad to see you are finding yourself again. I know it's so easy to loose yourself among all the noise and chaos of this journey we call life! you just remember the truth is found in your quiet place in a small still voice.  I love you Michelle  your number one fan and here if you need a friend that's been there before.     Rita
I'll always love Michelle, but I just miss her old makeup tutorials from back in the day
you vietnam
Ur only loading trash in the water
this is freaking beautiful, but loads of people in the comments are saying they aren't rich enough to do this. you don't need money to create magic in ur life x
Can't relate.
I love michelle phan
How did you make Vietnam look so beautiful? 😂 it's ok Im Vietnamese as well.. Where my Viet fam at?
I miss her! 😩😭
👍🏻❤️💕❤️
So are you no longer Christian?
I am Vietnamese and I have been there before it is beautiful  the food is yummy great I grown up there and I go to Vietnamese school so I could learn more Vietnamese than I already know and if anyone doesn't below  me than just trust me and my life and think if anyone could lie for a great culture
This is the most beautiful video on YouTube
Does anyone know why she hasn't been uploading?
She read the alchmist.
gurdeep
can anybody tell wheres dom ? her boyfriend did thay brokeup ? :(
Viet girls are the Best girls
Tại sao Michelle Phan mặc váy hở lưng như thế mà vào chùa?
Was it the first time Dom go to Vietnam? How can he ride motobike on street like that? Wow. I have some foreign friends and it took them like 1 week to dare cross the street, about 3 months to ride motobike LOL.
I just went to Vietnam, this hit home
she buddhist?
amazing video, so proud of you as a Vietnamese girl who can do something that unbelievable.
This Video...It’s so beautiful and just perfect
Mish, we miss you so much. :'(
Can somebody tell me what temple she was at to pray?❤️
if you want to understand llife and where you came from....read a QURAN.........
she gave me courage on this video to discover more,to explore more and be who u are...
your voice is so relaxing. 
you experience the reality of life even the sorrow and hardships but still you know how to look back and appreciates what truly matters in life. create a podcast. surely you'll inspires a lot.
This video was truly beautiful, but she came off as kinda narcissistic...life isn't all as easy-breezy as it looks here. There is poverty and difficulty amongst every street. I admire Michelle so much for showing all the beautiful things in life, but please don't forget about the people who struggle. Always check your privilege, guys.
THAT BLACK DRESS is so weird to be worn in most of these clips. like really? cudn you wear something more appropriate?
Vietnam is my country 💟💟
who's watching 2017
I love Viet Nam now
Hi Michelle! hope you had a better voice over editing. Because you actually invest a lot in your vídeos is kind of dissapointing hearing awful sounds that mouths do naturally, this happens a lot when you have a really good mic all sounds go into the recording and then they become a nightmare. Drinking water between recording helps a lot and also hearing carefully with headphones while editing the sound mix. I know all this maybe you alredy know but is such a shame seeing/hearing this from someone that has so many years in Youtube and actually have made a career out of it. Stay awesome.
khi nào qua Đài loan chơi đi chị
Inspiring & aestheitic  !!!
Good luck for you!
I love her voice!
Bro I ain't going to Mexico do u know what a cartel is lmao
You go me confused who was Vietnamese with dope2111
Michelle's voice is so soothing
❤️
love her voice

Chị Michelle Phan ơi! Chị là ng việt phải k
is this an ad!?
lol. the narration is so corny
việt nam quê hương tôi
you posted this on my birthday 2 years ago, today, i am rewatching.
<3
I miss her!!!
for me, I have no roots. no family, no partner and hardly any friends. guess I better come up with a plan
Lovely cinematography but I got a little concerned about the name it claim it vibe and wonder who exactly you're praying to. If it's not Jesus, that's not good. That aside, it's important to be grateful for the good you have and take responsibility for your life, so thank you for that. Vietnam looks fascinating.
Our homelands so beautiful, isnt it? Im living in VietNam, and i love my country more and more after i saw these kind of videos. thank god, i am Vietnamese!
I'm Vietnames
i feel like everything in this video is so perfect,simple, and beautiful - yet my life looks like shit...

This reminds me of the Inspirational Bo Dallas!!!
I feel like I don't have a culture because my ancestors are Irish and I have one ancestor who is a Cherokee Indian. I don't feel like I can justify myself to explore Cherokee culture and I don't feel as if my Irish roots are enough. I still don't know much about where I came from, but it's awesome that you do Mish! glad you had a fun time.

I don't know why I cried so hard to this video, it made me realize a lot of things that I don't know about my Vietnamese, Chinese, and Cambodian roots. I wanted to let you know that this video inspired me so much to always keep pushing forward and to appreciate everything in my life. Thank you for reminding me of my culture and where I came from.

You are an amazing person Mish. please research about Veganism it helps animals( as I know you love cats) , all animals feel pain dear. Vegan helps earth to fight back the global warming. I'm sure if u'll study about it you'll get the idea.

This video is so beautiful
is she still with Dom? I saw Dom was in the video
This video is beautiful
You can make a movie, dem camera skills.
Do you love Vietnam?
There's so many reasons why i gravitate to Michele Phan and Lupita Nyong'o;one reason  is because they reflect so much positivity n awareness.
This video is so inspirational and soul-searching. I think part of Michelle's artistic skills reflects on the way this video is conceived, directed and edited. Think she out did herself with this one. Beautiful, delicate, soothing- too many words to correctly describe this video. Thumbs up !
can we please talk about that little boy who just casually blew fire out of his mouth.
my Vietnam
Love.
I got chills when I watched this video.
I'm also halfway through reading your book :D 
Love this and love you!
This so beautiful video very relaxing voice and I loved 💖 thank you for this Video 💖

YES! This was so inspiring to me, thank you for taking the time to put this together and sharing
I come back and watch this video whenever I need inspiration <333 
Her messages are so powerful, Michelle is genuinely everything I aspire to be :')
I was just in VN when you were I think😂
this is a masterpiece
OMG Viet Nam looks so amazing, and it is. Many people said that our country is poor & not very intersted. WTH ??
Yayyy!! So proud of my country ^^ Dear friends around the world, if you have a chance, please come and discover our beautiful Vietnam. And I promise that you'll never regret ^^ P/s: Ao Dai is perfect for not only men but also women ^^
💜💜

"The power of thought and prayers, i had to remind myself not to forget that. If you can think it, believe it, and put it in work, it can happen."
❤ Vietnam in my heart

I live in Vietnam too 😝😝😝😝😝
is she Vietnamese?
Tôi rất thích video này, rất hay, rất đẹp, nói ngắn gọn là rất tuyệt vời. Nhưng nếu được, tôi xin đóng góp 1 chút xíu ý kiến nhé, ở Việt Nam khi đi chùa chiền, cúng bái thì chúng ta nên mặc đồ kín hơn 1 xíu, đừng mặc áo dây hở ngực mà nó mất đi vẻ tôn nghiêm...
I like your Ao Dai dress. :)

Do not dirty the river with papers Michelle!
Oh those americans!
Does she have a boyfriend

Ngũ Hành Sơn moutain
Woa...Vietnam is an amazing country and wonderful people in your video...I love Vietnam..love you too.  <3
I belong there too.
i love vietnam also my main country and i never realised until i watched this video how lucky i am to have a life,a family,friendship and how i should be grateful!I watched this while in vietnam and all these thoughts flooded into me about how i should be stuck indoors 24/7 and how i should explore and discover things about my culture to learn who i truly am!
Vietnam is the most beautiful place to be
After Watching this video, Michelle really made me missing Vietnam so much and started to realized how beautiful is my country <3 I really need to go back to Vietnam!!
Thank you
+Michelle Phan i dont know how old this video is but i hope you see this comment. as a young adult, i can understand as well as anyone the feeling of not knowing where your going. of feeling like your not where your meant to be. and, i dont know if your questioning a career change, but i can tell you this: you've made a true stamp on this world. your kindness, your genorosity and your wisdom beyond your years have inspired millions of people to stay strong, even during the hard times. whenever i concidered dropping out of HS, i watched one of your vids and became inspired to finish. whenever i've concidered giving up on my dream to be a writer, to find something more "safe" or "traditional'", you've helped me find the courage to follow my dream, dispite what anyone says. i used to be imbarassed about watching your videos because most people see it as only for girls, but i proudly tell people, both men and woman, to watch you when their having a bad day. your a truely one of a kind woman, with an extraordinary gift. a gift to inspire. so, in closing, i'd like to personally thank you, Michelle, for truely changing my life and the lives of so many others.
Oh! Viet Nam . I LOVE VIET NAM
I remember the days when she was a Christian...
Am I the only one who thinks that the fishing scenes destroy the beauty if the Video?
Watching this is amazing.. Mostly bc I'm in Hanoi rn (capital of Vietnam) ^~^
What kind of editing program did you use? So beautifulll!!
Vietnam is beautiful, isn't it? I'm proud that I'm Vietnamese
In july I am going to Vietnam for 3 weeks to visit my family!! SO short! I really miss Vietnam❤️You are SO beautiful❤️
The video was so beautiful.
Xin Chao chi Michelle Phan
ILY mish💖
Your Amazing!!!!!!!
wow....really beautiful ever seen
This reminds me of one of those amazing captivating ads. I loved it and your voice is so soothing but I didn't like the part when you pulled up all the fish, it's cruel and they suffocate :(
Going back to the Philippines this summer!!
i live vietnam
So many feels
OMg im #VIET and i went to go to Vietnam in the summer cause i want to experience more stuff!!!!😅😂😇
Where are you
♡♡♡
i love viet nam
i is vietnamese
amazing video
This was beautiful to behold but ultimately it was meaningless. "You don't know where you're going until you know where you've been" is a foolish notion.
*Looks at all of these products
Me: I'll check some websites!
*Looks into wallet
Me: Do you think any of these websites take pennies
I love how professional her videos look omg...
Holy shit Michelle. Literally you addressed and recommended sooo many things that I've been searching for. This was incredibly helpful and although you may not post as the other youtubers out there, you are definition quality over quantity. Everything you produce is amazing. This channel is my yearly favourite :)
She's so pretty 😍😍


Who agrees?
I love that she makes these videos and they're not sponsored. It makes me feel like her opinions are genuine and she's not just trying to sell something like all the other beauty gurus.
Hold up...Michelle uploaded...STOP LIFE AND WATCH!! 🙌
Hi Michelle! Missed your last video and thought you had been gone for a while! Time for me to catch up 🤓Hope your doing really well, loving those braids and all the awesome favorites!
Already hit the like button before I even see the video 😆 anyone else
25 minutes of Michelle IM IN HEAVEN ❤️
Hey Michelle! Shop Inu Inu scammed their manufacturer, not paying for any of the merchandise, essentially leaving them bankrupt! They have super cute clothes, but if you google Inu Inu scandal, you can read more!
INUINU is terrible! earlier this year, i was on instagram and my friends were posting about a chinese manufacturer who made clothing for INUINU. the manufacturer could not send the products on time because of the chinese new year, and after when INUINU finally received the packages late they did not pay the manufacturer because they were angry. they almost went bankrupt because of INUINU. i posted the photo about the manufacturer, and INUINU blocked me so that is always fun :)) their store is called DOGDOG and i think they are fine now, but still it makes me think that INUINU is messed up.
24 min Michelle Phan video! YASS!😍 anyone else agree?!
also, soundhound can recognise a song if you sing it or hum it yourself
Michelle have you ever seen Madoka Magica? It's a very beautiful and deep magical girl anime with some dark themes, but I think you would like it :)
Rick and Morty is awesome! I highly recommend Steven Universe though, it's a beautiful show.
So fun. Love that necklace you're wearing, so pretty. ♥
Your last name is my OTP's ship name :) any other peeps from the phandom out there?
michelle, when is the first chapter of helios:femina will be release? i'm really excited for that!!!!💕💕
WE WANT PART 3 LOL! :)
OMG THE HOLOGRAPHIC SKIRT 😍😍😍 also I have the it's a 10 conditioner! It works reaaaally good.
Hi Michelle :) This is kind of a random comment, but I didn't know where else to write this, as I don't have any other social media.. I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU so so much. It might seem strange that you could have such a huge impact on someone's life but for me (and many others, I'm sure) you are a huge inspiration. I began watching your videos 7 years ago when I was just 12 or 13 years old and remember thinking you were so hardworking and amazing. I loved the underlying theme of all your videos - that you can be whoever you want to be and you can do ANYTHING if you work hard enough and believe. So I honestly believe that you were a large part of me achieving of my dreams. I was so motivated by your success and work ethic that I worked my butt off to get into the uni I love and here I am today, a 20 year old med student - I'm the happiest I've ever been, even while studying really hard in med school and working a job on weekends. Still today I find it astounding how you can fit your life around being a multiple business owner, a girlfriend, a youtuber etc and that has largely influenced how I go about living my life today. Thank you for always being honest, real, beautiful inside and out, and for never giving up. You are, and always will be, one of my biggest inspiration. Peace be with you xx
such a good vibe always Michelle Subbed :)
I absolutely love your hair styling--how did you do that?
a show similar to adventure time is steven universe, i personally prefer steven universe to adventure time. rebecca sugar who helps with adventure time is the person who makes steven universe. i highly recommend steven universe to everyone!
Tokyo Goul, absolute favorite of the year for me too. I just love it <3, I can't wait for the second season Attack On Titan :)
"It's a simple setup..."
struggles with the Gorillapod
Haha, never change, Michelle.
this is gonna sound so weird but i love your voice haha i could listen to you talk all day. its so relaxing💖💖😂😇
Michelle, I love your make up here, it looks so natural and your skin are glowing beautifully. 😍😍😍
I have the same necklace as you Michelle I got my one in Vietnam 🇻🇳 . TWINNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm stunned. You're skin is so beautiful. I feel jelly.
I want to be called Phan for my last name 




Phan is real

MICHELLE WATCH GRAVITY FALLS YOU'LL LOVE IT
Mane n' tail works so well because it was made for show horses! <3
If you like Adveture Time then also give Steven Univers a try. It like a kids show but when you see the bigger picture its much more.
You look like you're about to cry... are you okay??
I swear by BaByliss products! Hands down, best flat iron out there.
Your hair 😍😍
It's like Michelle can't even make good videos cause y'all stay complaining that everything is sponsored . Like did y'all forget her profession is mainly beauty?
I thought you would recommend Steven Universe! That seems right up your alley.
Can you do a video on crystals/healing crystals?? ✨

I screamed when you said you loved rick and morty 😂 I can't wait till season 3 😍
Hey Michelle! I just wanted to tell you that the manufacturer for Inu Inu was scammed by them and was nearly left bankrupt. The manufacturers have opened up their own store with the same products as Inu Inu called Dog Dog (ik lmao). The prices at Dog Dog are a lot more affordable than Inu Inu. So, if you want to support the manufacturers and also get the same products at a cheaper price, I would recommend shopping at Dog Dog instead!
You're just so amazing and I love finding out about these new products I've never seen or heard of before
I love that you are healthy and beautiful!!
Keep doing life!
Omg I use mane n tail products on my horse 😂
dear michelle phan have you heard of a sweet amazing girl name talia castellano
this is the best thing to see when you just woke up . Love you michelle <3

OHMY U LOVE TOKYO GHOUL O.O IT IS BAEEEEEE

I love Rick and Morty!!! I can not wait until the next season starts!
Dang I really thought she was going to talk about the Neko Atsume app
I feel like you would really enjoy the show Steven Universe on cartoon network, the animation is absolutely adorable and the characters are super lovable 💕
My hair is protein sensitive and alot of the products u recomend have protein. Do you have any good hair protects that have no protein, thx. Love you
Steven Universe is the best TV show.
I love you so much! <3
Hi Michelle, I started watching you when you first started off and you've become so successful and I'm so happy for you. The looks you create are so beautiful and your tutorials helped me when doing make-up which gave me the confidence to start my own channel and upload my own looks. Thanks Michelle (:
Amazingg briad,,,! Love ur videos!!
Thank you so much for your suggestions Michelle, You always inspire me. Thank you so much my inspiration <3 xoxo
I wish I had a friend like you in real life, someone who's into beauty but not conceited about it, into futuristic aesthetics, Japanese style, cartoons, astronomy and spiritual things. I'm into all those things too but can't find anyone with the same interests 😅🙆🏼
Bobs Burgers, Rick and Morty, Tokyo Ghoul and Adventure Time, these are straight up some of my favourite shows, especially Rick and Morty!
TOKYO GHOUL YAAY
MICHELLE YOU ARE LIKE MY TWIN WHY ARE WE SO ALIKE OH MY GODDDDDDDDD
o my god michelle phan you look amazing
Michelle, what makeup colors like eye shadows would go with a dress that has a top that's purple and a bottom that's black? Thank you Michelle! 
PS: I love your braids! :)
//squeals when she mentions Tokyo Ghoul//
hi Michelle! I've been a subscriber for about four years and I never get disappointed with your amazing videos! I love you so so much and you inspire me in so many ways and I love your book, too❤️❤️
DO A SKIN CARE DEVICE VIDEO!!!
More video with your boyfriend :) love is the most important :)
I loveeee your hair! You should do a tutorial! Does anyone know the certain name of these type of braids?
Michell Phan... WATCH STEVEN UNIVERSE. You will fall in love.

I've missed you so much, Michelle.

OH MY GOODNESS I HAVE THE EXACT SAME WATERMELON BAG I BOUGHT AT SM!
Watch Once upon a time. It's so underrated! I'm in love with it. You may not like season 1, but if you stick it out till season 3, you will become 'Hooked' ( OUAT pun intended.)



That is if you have stupid amounts of time to waste, because you have no life. Like me.😊


Watch it!
my mom just gave me that mic b/c she got it from work and never used it lol
Just wanted to say that I loved the video. I love how you put a main menu to make it easier to find certain sections if we do not have time to watch the whole video. It shows you put a ton of time into this video and the description is very informative and easy to find the products you went over. Thanks so much for all you do and don't worry if you don't have much time to post a ton of videos every week because this shows how much you still care about your viewers, really props to you, Michelle, so proud of how far you've come since I started watching you. Keep up the great work and keep soaring higher.
YASSS TOKYO GHOUL
AAAAAH THIS IS AMAZING STOP BEING AMAZING
Your my favourite you tuber I love u so much michelle
I love you so much!!! You inspire me
i know you know psychedelic drugs. thats why you're so enlighted, i can hear the tone in your voice. but i still love you
If u used the 360 camera to do a video that would be the coolest thing xx
I love these videos please make more 😍
Took me forever to finally watch this video, but I love love love that you recommended Bob's Burgers! I think the show doesn't get recognized enough!
I wouldn't say that Bob's Burgers is a family friendly show lol
Puppy cat in the background 😍😍
I LOVED this series! You recommend some really unique things! Are you going to do a New Years Makeup Look this year? I loved Golden Hour and Midnight Luster ^_^
omg Michelle will you upload a New Years eve makeup tutorial??? xx
if someone gave me a teeth whitening kit, I'd be kinda lowkey offended...
You are a beautyful girl😍😍 I love your chanell and your videos are beeeest!😜💗
I love Rick and Morty omg
amazing I love your videos , they inspire me a lot
Oh my Lord. You and my sister are the same sign and have so much in common with what you watch its crazy. Everything you said about your favorite shows I have heard come out her mouth so many times in the past years. Besides that, Michelle I love you and your videos so much. I'm really glad you took your time to make these 2 vids about products you would truly recommend. You always stay real and honest. Michelle, you will always be on of my favorite Youtubers <33
I just want to thank you for introducing me to Rick and Morty! Absolutely love it.
I'm surprised Steven Universe wasn't mentioned!! The whole gem concept alone seems like something Michelle would be all about... It's very much in line with her aesthetic!
I love Tokyo Ghoul..... It's really emotional and deep... I also love Adventure Time, with amazing stories and humour, and it is also emotional. It has fun songs too!
DO A TUTORIAL ON THIS MAKE UP LOOK!!!
This was so helpful
Tokyo ghoul though 😍
I love to see your videos of the best of the year 💗💗
the roooommm has the second season now. best game ever
Where did you get this awesome selfie stick??? 😱😱😱

Em rất thích khuôn mặt của chị Michelle . Fan VIETNAM
Because of your Tokyo foul recommendation I binge watched the entire first season in a night. Incredible show.
Omg I use a lot of those products..they really do work!
i died when she talked about tokyo ghoul

if ur wondering, it works great on them too
Your hair is literally so beautiful
omg! TV Show? Thats The Walking Dead for sure!
Hair tutorial please!
tokyo ghoul is my favorite anime ever!! if you like tokyo ghoul I also suggest Psycho Pass, Noragami, and Death Parade.
Please please please make hair tutorials! Lately you've been wearing so many amazing hairstyles <3
best video of the year !!!

don't shop at store inuinu
AIR BNB!!!
What drawing app do you use?
Tokyo Ghoul !!! <3
I LOVE NUME THEY HAVE THE BEST SALES LITERALLY
ADVENTURE TIME WOOO
I dont know if you know about it probably yes but Once Upon a Time, Steven Universe and Gravity Falls are 3 shows besides Adventure time that are freaking awesone highly recommended!!!!
+Michelle Phan  
I absolutely love and adore your unique style and beauty as well as your amazingly done videos and all the hard work you put into them. I was just wondering if you would consider making The Power of MAKEUP video? It would be super cool!
pleeeaaaseee put a tutorial on your braids
I love tile. works amazing
could you do a turtorial of your hair please love you !!!!!
I love her videos so much even though I might be a little young I can still relate to them.And I'm also Vietnam like her
I like desperately need you to do an audio book version of your book! Your voice soothes me so so so much :)
Yes slayyyyy omg
Michelle, I start school in 4 weeks! Can you make a back to school video? I love you. Your so inspiring. 😍❤️
"Lets go home, kaneki . . ."
Mish!!! I wanna know how you do your make up in this vedio! your skinnnnn is glowing!!! is sooooo perfect omg
what is that pink diamond thing in the background?
HI! I love thi video, it really helps a lot... But I have a one off-topic question! What's that thing on your neck and where to buy it <3
yasss Tokyo ghoul
I stop what ever I'm doing to watch your videos 💖😍😁
postmates is basically like go-jek lol with fewer options i think
You should try Attack on Titan. (The animated version!) It's soooooooo good!
Yes! Your videos are the best.
It would've been awsome if the apps talk started at 17:38😂
Omg i want that camera and selfiestick and every stuff ! 
I sometime wonder if michelle gives away all that stuff to me 🙊
"dreaming"😴
awesome videos michelle! the quality you put it with the items and links in the bio is so helpful!
So you watch tokyo ghoul but you still can't pronounce Rize correctly?
Where did you get the necklace from ? It's soooo pretty on you
Please make a video on how to make a youtube vid that includes pop ups, backgrounds,transitions,ect.
Your makeup in this video is gorgeous!
uber is not the best thing....there are people who work as taxi drivers so they have to get a permission for driving people around for money...that permission is expensive and you have to refresh it everey few years. Uber drivers do not have to get a permission so they ruin the taxi business in some cities. Seems to be unfair.
Dear Mish pls do Christmas makeup and new years goals ❤
I'm from Russia! And I love to watch your videos! You're cool!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi Michelle!! I think you should check out the show Steven Universe :) It is probably one of my favorite cartoons, and after I started watching it, I stopped watching adventure time. It is extremely adorable in terms of looks and plot, but there are also very adult themes and character development that is hidden behind the plot. The ideas are very original and out of this world, yet these strange adventures are relatable. I think you would really like it! 

btw I love your videos :) and bobs burgers. and Rick and Morty. SO FUNNY.
Miss wAtching your old videos. ❤️
I love this video!! Please do more in the feature.
You are gorgeous!
Hi +michellephan please do a New Year's eve look. I really miss your tutorials for wearable makeup look. I love you Michelle Phan you are the very first reason why I studied and started doing makeup. Love lots <3
Am I the only one in love with her laugh? xP
Hi michelle can you make a video how do you tie your hair? Thank you ❤️
This whole video was awesome
tokyo ghouuul
I love you Michelle 💕💋
What heat protectant do you recommend? Ily so much!
Check Steven Universe. Beauty and complexity in a "child cartoon"  absolute love
michelle i was just wondering why i cant find your products in my country? your products look awesome tho!
are you and dom still together??
YESSSSS BOBS BURGERS
Mish please do another heart to heart video like last year ? It's nice to know some things about you and also it was a very calming video for me to watch in my me-time.
adult swim shows #yassbae
The amazing world of gumball is THE BOMB and it's hilarious
part 1 and 2 i loved sooo much!!! another thing im loving is the lipstick you're wearing! may i know what it is?? (I don't own anything in that colour!!) thank you! xx
I 💖 Rick and Morty
She would be such a powerful voice for peace, if she was vegan. She honestly such a beautiful person, not just on the outside. We need more people like her.
Ahhhh TOKYO GHOUL
love you beautiful
Do you play Neko Atsume Mich? :)
Love you mish x lots of love from malaysia

Over the garden wall was soo incredible and adorable. i wish they made more of it...
i re-watched tokyo ghoul s1&2 like 3 times. lol.

when she was talking about Tokyo Ghoul 
me: aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

Michelle's background music reminds me of Sims. 😊

I've been using the Crème of Nature leave in for about six months. It's a great detangler.
she have so much hair \( X o X )/
I love the Aussie deep conditioner it's amazing and  I love adventure time and Bob's burgers
You should check out this show called Steven Universe. It's made by some of the same people who made Adventure Time, and and the art style, plot, and characters are just amazing.
i'm surprised that she didn't point out Steven Universe. It seems like a show she would watch. Love you videos Michelle <3
How do we have to apply them. Do we jave to wash them before we apply another product?
I'm early 😍😍😍
Michelle was one of first youtubers I ever watched! She inspired me to create my own channel <3
xo,Mima
Love this type of video !! ♥️♥️
Have you seen the anime free! ? Its so good im quite obsessed tbh
random question that came to mind when i saw the michellephan's phone: Samsung note 5 or IPhone 6 plus?

HOLY CRAP, I NEED TILE.

Hey, Mish <3 I just wondered where you bought the cat purse in the background of your video? Just loooove it 😍😍😘
Ohmygod I was waiting for her to say Tokyo Ghoul.... Am I the only one?
i havent watched your videos in a while mish, but this definitely reminded me why i started watching in the first place! i loved it :D x
The hair products are so cool but why does the titanium flat iron make your hair shiny??
Please do a hair tutorial
I love this video s pleas moreeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Michelle please do more. Makeup videos :)
I was waiting for the Tokyo Ghoulrecommendation, and here it is!! I am a hardcore fun of Attack on Titan and when it ended my bf told me about Tokyo Ghoul....I finished it in 3 days... :$ :P so yeah its awesome!! <3 your videos <3
When you were talking about postmate I thought about mamamiamakeup.

Show us ur DIY mask or sth for hair please!! Really like ur hair thingss!! THANKS FOR BEING A GOOD BEAUTY GURU ON YOUTUBE😊 im from indonesia... See yaa!!
Omg Yess inu inu!! I love that site

The Belcher family got shout out:) I'm very happy lol
Michelle, do you check to make sure these brands don't test on animals? I love makeup and hair stuff too but sometimes ya just gotta sacrifice if someone else is being harmed. :(
Also, this video was so well done! It looks so professional. :)
Michelle is so pretty inside and out x
I wish I had money
😖
I love Michelle even more for this!
u should watch rwby and ghost hunt
In Indonesia, we have Gojek.
i love its a 10! i dont use it the same way you do but i feel the same results! love it!
Lyft > Uber!
Hey, Michelle. New year has started and I hope yours has been great so far. Some video requests I have for this new year, better diy skin/hair products care would be very useful. As for things other than beauty, more vlogs with different foods, cultures, and just having fun. Maybe even making great food, or just ways to put minds at ease. New year, less stress. Just some random ideas. Thanks Mich❤️
Any shop similar to inu inu but less expensive than that? i love their collection but its a little expensive for me. Please lemme know.
If you're still waiting for attack on Titan season 2 watch Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood NOW!!!!!! You'll thank me later
Shop inu inu blocked me on instagram because I commented something about one of their models having arm pit hair u_u like wtf. I wasn't even bashing them.
Michelle, you're such an inspiration. You have worked so hard to be in the place you are right now! You're a strong girl! Good luck! <3
Can you do some vlogs pls
I'm not a fan of Adventure time, but I really like We Bare Bears... ♥  ;)
cool stuff michelle 😂
DOMIN NEEDS TO BE IN HER EVERY VIDEO
I love it when you do these videos. Thank you
HAPPY NEW YEAR MICHELLE!! 😊🎉💓
The sunglasses are $125 + rip
I always watch her videos to calm myself down...
I luv ur braids how do u do the braid
WATCHED IT TILL THE END...^^...
ITS SO NICE HOW..WE'RE ALIKE .WATCHING ANIME..CARTOONS...^^
when Michelle was talking about long lasting temporary tattoos i remembered i literally put on a freaking BURGERVILLE temporary like 7 weeks ago and its still there on my lower stomach. smh
God I love you michelle!!
Michelle, you should check out the app Neko Atsume! It's so cute and tamagotchi-like.
jawbone is sooo  low sounding and has lots of static, not worth the money I think
I'm not the kind of person who really likes trends and tumblr and things that Michelle enjoys, but I watch her videos because I love her personality and her voice.
I always Play the room with my dad bc we both love riddles :D
Omggg how come no one has said anything about her awesome selfie stick!?!?! Is freaking Sailor Moon!!!!!! Omgg she is just sooo awesome!!!!!!
хочутебя ласково ебстивтвоющелку
ONE PUNCH MAN!
When she said INU INU did anyone else hear innuendo? X3
HEY MISH PLEASE MAKE A 60S OR HIPPIE MAKEUP LOOK!!
Love this!
Hey Michelle, I love your videos and think you are an awesome beauty expert and role model! I was wondering if you know any other fashion companies with clothing similar to Inu Inu? Thanks!
Michelle is so gorgeous 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love how she puts a lot of info about why a certain product is amazing,and how she's saying it based on real experience and not because it's sponsored :) Ily Michelle <3
I'm so not fashionable
Why are all your videos so 'dark' I have noticed?
What is the camera that you use for filming  YouTube videos? I really like the quality! Hope someone tell me ✨
u should watch Fairytail!
I know it's kinda late, but can you make a best of 2016? Also, why haven't you been posting as much, I just want more Michelle, ya know
Michelle Phan where did you get the sailor moon selfie stick??
Can you make a makeup video ❤️❤️
she's amazing
What is that pink diamond in the back? PLS reply
I love it when you do videos like this
How often do you GLO??
I have the same flat iron 😂😂
Crossy road is pretty lame. And regarding Uber, don't you feel their price hikes get insane? During peak hours they increase costs 20x sometimes.
OMG MANE AND TAIL !
I see the crystal- I hope in your quest for truth you come back to the cross. Praying for you
Mane'n'Tail I definitely recommend for anyone who still doubts. It's amazing and perfect if you want to grow out your hair. 👌👍
hOW about dry shampo, sis? thanks u
why u are so perfect?  I love Michelle
Love thisssss
You've get so much prettier each year Michele!!! Excited for 2016's upcoming videos!
Im suprised she said manes and tails is affordable, her in Aus horse shampoo cost me like 20 bucks!! I spend more on shampoo for my horses than what i do for myself! 😂
I actually miss watching her makeup tutorials 😭😭😭
omg michelle! u really have to watch death parade! great anime, great story, all lot of feels 💔
please do a hair turtoriel
it's 2019 and i'm still here listening to her soothing voice:(
MY BIRTHDAY IS TODAY!! 💕💖💖😍🎊🎉
michelle looked tired in this video....nevertheless, beautiful
好勁. 加油!
PLEASE DON'T SHOP AT STORE INU INU
they're scammers and if you're unlucky they'll take your money. a bunch of people have ordered big packages of stuff from that store and never got their things after they paid for it. store inu inu also bankrupt they're supplier of products. 
if you want to buy these types of things, I highly suggest you find store dogdog on Instagram to check out the full story. they sell the exact same things and don't scam you and the prices are a lot lower. 
please no negativity on this, I just wanted to inform before anything bad happens to anyone. 
thank you!
Will you be doing one on books?
Does anybody know if Mish and Dom are still together?
I love all the videos that u do but I really miss the make up tutorials 😔😔
"bobs burger" lol girl
Do you mean astronomy? Lol, love the video Mish!!
Hi Michelle. Can you do a tutorial on your makeup? You are looking so youthful and fresh!
awww already watch all those shows ahah
Such a capitalist video hahaha
this is cool and good to know and i have used uber before myself last  year it was great and i used it again this year ! saves yo life! lol
Michelle I loved you so much but you changed...
I thought it said Star Wars 2 😂
Your hair is dry and cores?
idk how this sint got so manu views as other videos. I LOVE this. You get to really sit with her :) not much editing and all the fuss. Natural <3
definitely gonna watch tokyo ghoul and rock and morty :) also can't wait to check out the star wak 2 app
"i have my ways of doing it" did she just withhold sharing editing apps?
make you make more
Michelle, I adore your videos so much! Thank you for all the effort you put into your videos. I was wondering if you had any recommendations for someone who has oily skin? Also, you should check out Steven Universe, it's a great show out right now.
Hope there's a part three cuz loving it!
Although this video is very long there was so many interesting things I had no idea about!!<3 awesome video!!
I'm surprised Michelle hasn't watched Steven Universe. The Magical Girl Anime atmosphere is very big there and it has wonderful characters. It's also very aesthetically pleaseing. beautiful color palettes, diverse character designs, and a really entertaining plot. It's a little slow going in the beginning but once the majority of the characters get introduced, it really picks up and it's just a great watch.
Wow michelle your so beautiful!
tfw you live in australia but youve never seen the brand aussie ._.
ADVENTURE TIME.... FINNN
Michelle hi! Will generation beauty ever be in Denver Colorado? 😊❤️also tyfs ur great!
wow everything you know is awesome 😃
Isn't mane n tail for horses
I can't wait to check out some of the things that you mentioned ;) I enjoyed watching! xo
Your braid 😍😍😍😍
You know mane and tail is for horses right? That's what I use and all of my friends use on their horses
YASSSS!!! I love these personal videos where you talk about your favorite makeup and other things on camera. It just seems like we're actually talking.
YASSSS!!! I love these personal videos where you talk about your favorite makeup and other things on camera. It just seems like we're actually talking.
lets get swifty!!!
Thank you Michelle for the awesome recommendations. Totally gonna download some news apps today :).
Yaaayyy who else is here under 20min?? 👏🏾👏🏾😆
This is an awesome video, I am glad you do these videos to help other people!
Hey michelle!If you like adventure time you should start watching steven universe!!
Her braids are sooooo beautiful!!!
michelle did you even watch these shows? Bob's Burgers is SUPER vulgar... xD
ahh Michelle, inu inu is actually a really problematic store! they scammed their manufacturer for 4500+ products, and way overprice their products :-( the manufacturer has made a store selling the products for a cheaper price called dog dog. please signal boost! inu inu is way to popular for what they have done
How many people watch these videos and never buy the products? I do...
Hi michell happy new year
Michelle I would like to bring you food and have fun 😂😁😅
I use the main and tail and my horse does too😂
hiya michelle! Since you know alot about zodiac signs, Do you know what Pisces means?
Yaaaaassss bobs burgers !!!!!! Louisse is mah fave !!!!

Hi Michelle, Happy New Year!! I quite enjoyed both of these videos.  :)

What does she use for editing
A show that has a similar feel to Attack on Titan and Tokyo Ghoul while still being vastly different is Psycho Pass. It's a psychological thriller with great plot and characters. Definitely a must watch to add to the list
Aye I use mane' n tail deep conditioner too🐴🐴😄😄🙆🏻❤️❤️
It's like watching teleshopping

Понимаю, что пора подучить английский.

Ahhhhhh!! Where did you get the sailor moon selfie stick?!

For what you do what did you major in in College
Enjoyed both parts of this Best of 2015 info. It was calming just to listen to you talk about products you stand by. Btw, you somehow worded a PG-rated description of Rick and Morty. That is an accomplishment. Everyone enjoy the holiday season!
Dear Michelle, I know maybe you are very busy and don't have much time for making more videos, but I really enjoy watching your videos and would love to see more from you. It's such a pleasure watching your videos and you are the best! Love you! <3
❤😙
Who watched this on a phone and couldn't click the main menu but manually had to scrolll😞
i noticed puppycat behind you :o where did u get it???
for all fans of michelle, what happened with dominique?
I really want to get the GLO teeth whitener , but is it enamel save?!?!?
bob's burgers yessss
So helpful!
I get oily hair real quick, so are there any products that will help my hair a bit less oily?
I came up with that tile idea waaaayyyyy before it came out -_-
I believe you can get the hello kitty poloriod camera at urban outfitters online.
More videos like this!!
Where do you get a dreamer neon lamp??
Can you should us that cute hairstyle

Part 3
She really is the new Oprah .. I want to go shopping now
😍😍😍😍👏🏼😘
I love your hair
whos watching this now.?
Your videos are always so much fun to watch
Michelle, I love Tokyo Ghoul and Attack on Titan too! Check out One-Punch Man, I find that anime to be pretty good as well! Not as bloody or serious as the other two, but equally entertaining!
What lip gloss are u wearing in this?! Love it.
2015 was such an amazing year!
anyone know what these braids are called?
Can anyone let me know what her background music is called in the video?
Who else is watching in 2016?
Crazy Ex- girlfriend is a really good show its funny
Love the recommendations Michelle! But I have to admit-- dying to know where you got your lights and curtains. It makes the room look magical!
Do yoy have any recommended anime????
your eye looks very tired!!!!
one braid is thicker than the other and i'm cringing so hard
I'm a big phan of michelle phan omg... :')
The tokyo ghoul anime is nothing compared to the manga, so if you enjoyed the anime series I would recommend everyone to read the manga. Or if you haven't watched it at all jump straight into the manga!
❤❤❤❤❤
When ordering contacts what number on my prescription box is the one I put into the website
tokyo ghouuuuuuul!!!!;OOOOoOoo
I clicked 10000 times and my phone screen was about to broke, it didn't take me to anywhere 🤔
her braid are so cute
I would put Baby Quasar LED light on this list. I know Michelle is a fan too!
i love these videos so muchhhhhh
where's all your holiday tutorials?
can you do an everyday makeup routine for beginners, PLEASE!!!!
You should do a video on getting rid of acne! 😭 not just those small occasional small blemishes but like the larger more chronic type. Every time I get rid of a bunch (3-6 noticeably red pimples and large pimples) of pimples they seem to pop back up on my nose, forehead, chin, jawline or all of those areas.
I love your crop top Mish
Michelle check out the app think dirty. It rates products ingredients and how toxic they are. It's completely changed my life
Little big sound has amaaazing speakers and they have small speakers too (i have one).
l Love KING KILL
I loved this
Ohh myy godd Attack On Titan michelle you need to watch Fairy Tail its my favorite anime 
Spotify: Music for everyone
going on their web site: Spotify is currently not available in your country 
XD haha
this video is a mess
Wow so much info in this video this is great! Haha seamless is amazing too! People be careful with uber though you never know about these drivers!! Omg michelle have you watched we bare bears?? Or the new dragon ball super??
you are still the queen here in youtube (as for me) really want your suggestions, advices, etc. hoping for mishdom videos :)
I have a blue yeti!
chị Michelle phan ơi chị làm một clip makeup tiếng việt đi ạ
Bobs burger is not on netflix. If it is I can't find it😩😩
Any recommendations for oily hair?
Sorry for the late comment but you should check out an anime called Fairy Tail if you haven't already :)
where are you from?
All the things are soooooo expensive!!
Gosh! I can't believe how much time has passed since I had first started watching Michelle's videos. I had to have been around 12 or 13. It's weird looking back on the bad days I had at school, going home, and watching her videos. They made me feel better (Especially the make up tutorials). Even now, I may not be in school, but the fact that I'm 19 and I still watch her videos after having a difficult day at work (or other problems) is insane. Not in a bad way, but it's like a routine. Her videos are so refreshing and she taught me how to wear make up. Thank you so much for making awesome videos, Michelle! :) P.S. Tokyo Ghoul and Attack on Titan are fantastic animes!!!!
Dear Michelle❤️ You are so inspiring💞 You video quality is so good along with the content❤️ The thing is I live in Cambodia. I don't know if you know much about Cambodia but it's near Vietnam. I'm actually Australian but have lived here since I was 3! Would u please consider having a meet up here? Love u and please keep on making inspiring videos!!!! Cuz I am a phan 😂💞
I hope that other triple moisture product works because I've tried the mask and I didn't like it at all, it felt really heavy on my hair and left a feeling of never having been completely washed out which was gross to me.
This channel is not what it was before.
Scream Queens?
Maybe I'm a little too late to this video, but I've tried looking for "Enlight" in the app store but I can't find it no where😭
I have that flat iron!! the babyliss!! i have had it for 4 years now and it works just as new :3 i love it!
I love Rick & Morty and Adventure Time.
I'm sorry to say this but it looks like it's the first time you're using that whitening device. You had to look for the correct port to plug in?
check out the game DUET from the app store. It's crazy goood
wait I'm late but isn't inu inu that problematic brand who scammed their fornissor?
She should start vlogging
Didn't she once have 10 mio. sub? Or do I remember wrong?
super awesome
I love bobs burgersss
@michellephan I rilly wish u would do what is on my phone and my fav music video 🙊
hi  love your video
I love you can you do a house tour 
Is this all product available in drugstore
michelle, i would like to ask you something. i have a major problem on slef conscious... its really burning my opportunities on my daily routine. i often get panic attacks, anxiety attacks, i tend to get nervous and anxious. can you please give me some advice. it would make the world to me 😊💞
i basically swear by TRESemmé it's at a reasonable price and it works like a charm
Michelle you have such beautiful videos! <3 just wondering... what songs were your favorite from 2015? Keep up the amazing work!
👉👏👏👏👏👏👈🏃
Amazing Michelle! 2015 was awesome😍😍👍🏽
what's the pink diamond at the back? I've been wondering like forever
But no Steven Universe??
Whats up with Dom? I havent seen them together in almost a year... :/
♥
I love Michelle. She has that down-to-Earth, fresh, unique vibe. Even though Im not into makeup that much, I aspire to be like her because she is so wonderful and confident.
Please Someone Tell Me Her Snapchat
I have the instax mini in baby
You are so cute girl💁
Those sunglasses are the bomb!
WOW nice job Michelle.
I have Crossy rode
Can you make a video on making animations?
Is she still going out with Dom ?
QUEEN
I have a question , 1. are you and dom still together ? 2.what happend to ,,em" ? (I didn't watch mish video since last year)
I've used sound hound for like 4 yrs..... Lol :)
My mom also watches your videos when she was younger too
nice necklace
If you're a big fan of Tokyo Ghoul Anime I suggest you guys read the Manga because its so much better than the anime and less cliff hanger
Chị cho thêm phụ đề tiếng việt nha
I find it funny how you manage to make even Rick & Morty sound romantic when in reality I would never let my mom watch that lol (gotta add that she turns off the tv at the slightest bit of brutality)
..don't get me wrong tho, I absolutely love that show but I think a lot of the humour and the wit goes missing if you're not focused on it 100% and all you see is disgustingness (if that's a word) ..and there's no denying that the show can be extreeemely disgusting at times haha but as I said, I love it and I think it's totally worth watching
+ Michelle phan
I feel like I really know you. Talking about you helped me make lots of friends, find out that I love makeup, and you're really fun to watch. I've been with you for a very long time, 3-4 years at least. I just wanted to let you know I'm proud of you and love you.
Outfit videos please
Didn't Inu Inu rip off DogDog tho?
It's a bummer that the romantic curls video is gone now. :-(
+MichellePhan
Trend alert plz

Hey Michelle keep on doing all these good work!! Anyways i wanted to ask you if you could make a how to look good without makeup or any products! Its a hard challenge i know...
michelle should try steven universe
That was so great Michelle
I'm so happy you mentioned adventure time. People around me don't understand why I love it so much. It's really random at times but once you start to connect the dots and see like where the characters come from and all its really great. plus each character is way different from one another so it's really interesting to learn about them.

Is there a name for that type of braid she has?
I feel like I'm watching the shopping channel
Very good video Mish 🔝👌🏻
hi Michelle!  I really like your black kitty handbag in the background of this video. Where did you get it? :)

Does anyone know if Michelle and Dom are still together ?????
Hey there Michelle ! How do you keep your hair so healthy as you always curl your hair or straighten them ?
does anyone know what kind of software she uses to create special effects and editing?
what kind of camera do you use to film michelle?
Dude I downloaded the app postmates but it won't load in my iPhone
She reminds me of an asian Khaleesi Daenerys ! xox
I miss youre old simple videos :(
She looks kinda sad in this video. :o

I went to look at the glo thing cause I wanted it but it was like $220 like aaaaaaaaa. idk if white teeth are worth that much
Wish You Happy New Year Michelle....
omg bee and puppycat
As much as I love the style, inu inu is a total scam. They've scammed their manufacturer and refused to pay for 4000+ items, stolen art and slapped it on shirts (then claiming that their designs had been stolen), and they block anyone who tries to say something or even ask. If you look up "inu inu scam" you'll see two huge posts about it as some of the first results.
Small you tuber very first video haul
Michelle phan can you do karai makeup tutorial from Nickelodeon teenage mutant ninja turtles PLZ :D
+Michelle ph
Why does she watch shows like that?? It was rly weird I was waiting for her to say pll or smith
hi michelle :) thanks for this, i found many useful tips and products to check out! I've been using 1 second everyday since 2013 and it is my fav fav FAV app. whenever you look back at your compilations it brings back so many memories <3 i can't wait to see more amazing vids from you. merry christmas and happy new year!!
Michelle, check out Psycho-Pass if you haven't!! :))
yes! Tokyo Ghoul is amazing! It can be a bit dark and has gore so warning to those who are not a fan of gore. Another good anime is Psycho Pass. If you like Tokyo Ghoul you might like Psycho Pass. Some gore, but very thought provoking.
Can you do a make up tutorial inspired by mahlagha Jaberi.  you probably don't know her but a make up tutorial on her would be amazing
she's so cute
I just would like to add that tattify is a company started by a youtuber called meghan rosette and I love supporting the youtube community so I hope you enjoyed that bit of extra information! c:
Michelle more videos like this Thumbs Up.
was she on youtube rewind i didnt see her
Is it just me or does she seem kinda lifeless or tired in this video?
Michelle  is enlight  app even for Android 
happy new yr michelle..... tkcr
Great video, Michelle!
she probably got paid like $50,000 for this video with all those sponsored products lmaooo
hey michelle can you do another 20 dollar makeup challenge ?
hohohoho tokyo ghoul and attack on titan hihi
Watching in 2016 😎
Michelle what how much makeup do u think is appropriate for 7th graders (like for a natural look)😁thanks
Love your videos Michel 😘
where is she,mich did not do a video for about 8 to 9 months 😭
😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥😍❤️💃🏼😍💗💗💋💋💋
Michelle have you watch IZOMBIE it on Netflix !!!!!!!!!!!!
can you name the app?
💗💗💗
Are you kiting me?
Is anyone else super tired of seeing the stupid ads for pg&e
what makeup is she wearing? especially her lipstick?? > . <
Her armpit looks nice :)
the only problem with INUINU is that they stole products from the person who was making them for them and did NOT pay for the products and basically cut out the original person who made their items. Now that person has their own store.
business, business, business :/   I don't think all that was her favorites, she get paid for advertising mehh :/
あかさ
I don't know how that will sound, but I'm always happily surprised that you don't fit into what people would think a "YouTube makeup celebrity" is. I mean, they just have to look at the shows you suggested and that can connect so many more persons than just the beauty community. My boyfriend watched Rick and Morty and has tried to make me watch it, which I haven't because I'm bad when it comes to watching something on TV, but you know what? You might have convinced me it's not just going to be some weird offensive humour I won't like. So here's a good news for him. Also, I always enjoy whenever you show stuff you like out of the beauty realm because it thinks of all small details like fun, price, look etc.

I wish you great holidays and a fantastic new year =)
is she related to promise phan
When she mentioned Urbanears I actually pumped my fist and screamed like a chairwoman, no kidding.
I wonder what happened to dom?
is she still dating her boyfriend Dom?
I want everything now.... /:
i tình yêu bạn rất nhiều, bạn có cảm hứng cho tôi rất nhiều lần
Michelle, what microphone do you use for voice overs and just normal talking?  Your voice sounds really clear and soft in your voice over videos.  Thanks <3  If anyone else knows, please let me know :)
Guys what was the name of the app she mentioned that's about "wanderlust" and renting stuff? I couldn't understand what she said? Something like "arabenbe"? I really want to find that app
That flat iron is everything! My mom picked one up for me after my favorite one finally broke on me and oh boy am I happy it did! I highly recommend it!
Michelle, your my inspiration and I would like to ask if you have those products in the Philippines because thats where I live and also how old are you I love you so much... 😊👏💋💜💄 I love makeup too..... toodles
I love watching best of 2015 videos
Love u :)
.did you search the app that she use to edit pictures for instagram?.I didn't understand what she said :(
I wish the nume hair wand had a cool tip so I could hold it from both ends. It would help stabilize the wand and avoid it slipping to one side and burning myself.
Michelle, I absolutely loved these two parts of the best of 2015. Every time I sit down to watch your videos, it's so calming and exactly what I needed. Despite not using the make-up or hair care products, I love love how there really are products you talked about that appeal to everyone, both guys and girls. The skin care section was definitely my favorite and I cannot wait to start playing with some new products!
What is the name of her braids ?
Chị là người lai à chị.. chị biết tiếng Việt không ??? Nếu có thể chị để cả phần tiếng việt đi chị. mong chị đọc được lời thỉnh cầu này
You look like princess Leia no offence tho you are goals
Hey Michelle! Just wondering are there any products you would recommend for dandruff that aren't too expensive and on the more natural side? 
I have one show for Michelle Phan to watch is  Steven universe its a great show :3
Michelle, I highly highly recommend that you check out Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, It has a wonderful story and characters and the music is amazing and it's beautifully animated please check it out!!!
i miss her videos
DO NOT BUY ANY OF INUINU PRODUCTS! Inuinu has ripped off many. Their old supplier from China was almost bankrupt because once during Chinese New Year ( something important to all China citizens ) they had to delay shipping due to the celebration. Shop INUINU had a hissy fit and didn't pay for all the products that were shipped by their supplier. They ordered 4000 items, you would probably know how much they owed. They're way overpriced too, the quality ain't even that great. @shopdogdog on instagram was their supplier i think. They steal designs from smaller companies too. (ps if you mention their old supplier on their instagram, they would block you)
am 11 and i never recived a xmas gift in my entire life am very poor and we have this rusty tablet am using i never felt special b4 so i dont really enjoy these cause it makes me feel bad
Question about the Rico theta (SP?)  how do you get the pictures off it (computer days for me are gone)  do they transfer to your cellphone or tablet?  And does it require an app to do so? I'm looking to take better photos for instagram and am interested in this 
chinbala
more makeup tutorials, you never post them any more that's what made you popular and are were you are . can you start posting more on YouTube
HI Michelle! Great Video As Always! You are my biggest idol and I love you so much! I love makeup but my parents always limit me with makeup and it's basically the only way I can express myself :( Any Advice? I'd Die If You Replied!
I love u michelle
does anyone else wonder what speaker is the diamond pink speaker on the shelf what is that?!?!?!
Did she and dom break up?
Cream of nature!! Yes get your black girl products! I use it everyday!

SHE HASNT POSTED SINCE LAST YEAR!!!!!!
Click did not work🙄
Imagine how much money she made on this video.
Which lipstick do you use in this video? I really like the color of it
20:34
Hi, Mish! May I know what lipstick shade and brand you're wearing here? I love it! Thanks in advance. :D
20:34
Does Michelle ever reply?? If she doesn't, well, it's kinda of like she doesn't care about us fans who sometimes don't have time to watch but still watch the whole thing
dont buy from inu inu, the girls are really bitchy and are rude to their workers, dont know how to manage money and sell bad quality items for high prices
Why are all ipsy giveaways for Instagram users only?
+Michelle Phan I honestly really admire you and your work. After seeing what you've been through in your life I was so thouched. You inspire me so much. My name is Maja, I'm from Poland and I'm studying to become a vet. I've never written to any of YouTube artists, but I want you to know that you inspire people all over the world. I love make-up, but I'm used to hiding that from people, because I want to be taken seriously. Your chanel showed me that I don't have to be ashamed of this part of myself. That I can be a growing scientist and a girly girl :D i want to thank you for that.
Shes like the American version of Zoella
inu inu actually ripped off their supplier. so don't buy from them, they are also ridiculously priced. check out dog dog store (their former supplier) or milk club (just a random website with the same things).
im ugly what should i do?
Oh gosh! Can anyone who sees this and has any solutions/ suggestions help me out ? I've been losing a LOT of hair lately. Every time I run my fingers through my hair I lose at least 5 strands. It scares me so much but I don't seem to be getting bald which is the odd part. Does anyone know if thin hair is more prone to breakage?
Aussie products are tested on animals:(
I'm 14 and my hair used to be really thick but now it's medium/kinda thin does anyone know what can i do to get it back to being thick anything thing would help I'm a vegetarian if that helps thanks
this year was the year I discovered your cannel. since then, my life as a Dreamer is better thank to you ♥
hi michelle. would you mind to share the color of your lipstick you are wearing on this video.
+Michelle Phan In 2016 You Should Make a Video Using Different Products On Women Of Color Because Sometimes We Can't Find The Right Tone Or Pigment Of Foundation In Order To Cover Blemishes And Really Make Our Faces Voluminous. I'm Only Asking Because I Can Never Find My Correct Tone. I Could Go to Target And I Would See SOOO Many Different Foundations And BB Cremes And I Would Just stand There Puzzled Because I Could Never Figure Out If I Was Honey Beige Or Caramel, Latte Or Nude, Tan/Olive Or Dark... So All I'm Asking Is To PLEASEE Put An End To This Makeup Injustice And Give Women Of Color Peace Of Mind Because We Want To Have That Picture Perfect Look Like You.. \(^.^)/
Which brand is curly hair？
How old are you
Do whats on my iphone video!!
MICHELLE!!!!! if you like adventure time watch Steven Universe, its really good and a bit similar to adventure time but its really different at the same time. its defiantly more thought out then your typical cartoon. I think its also really modern too, even though its a kids show i think its a good show for adults too, its more "open minded" and more 2015-2016 then most cartoons, it has subtle hints in there like you can tell some of the characters are lesbians or some might be transgender. Seriously if you have the time check it out!! its beautifully written and over all just really creative.
that woman is all about money all her viewers must be preteens or stupide
p
youve gained weight michelle
how about adult toys?
What's the difference between apple cider and apple cider vinegar? Can they be used for the same things?
very good video!😍
Ew girl you would actually go day 5 without washing your hair. That's disgusting. Dry shampoo is also disgusting
I have the normal instax mini I have baby pink
Cool app suggestions! Downloading apps in 3,2,1... 😄 Any new YouTubers out there looking to support each other? ❤️
Bh
300 people per sec wooow
i am just saying but i would like it if she does more makeup tutorial her videos are getting boring and i think that is why she is losing so many viewers and also the picture is not me i am 15 years old and before i get any hate comments this is just my opinion so yea thanks
God! I miss your videos so much Mish
it's important to you to have USA made brushes but it's not important to murder a bunch of cute little fluffy animals to make those brushes and then for you to sit here and try and promote that line. seriously Michelle there are so many different brands out there that are cruelty free that make exceptionally great brushes.
If you like Inu Inu, perhaps give them a pass and shop with Dog Dog instead. Dog Dog was a manufacturer for Inu Inu before Inu Inu decided not to pay them. They've since started up their own awesome little store at close to wholesale prices. If you want to save some $$ and support a little start up, Dog Dog is the way to go.
your so pretty!
i'm so early😁

Another good tv show/cartoon is Steven Universe! It's kind of like Adventure time. It's a very funny cartoon with action and it has lots of meaning in their episodes. SU also has very good, catchy music.

Привет из России))) Русские есть??????
+Michelle Phan I just want to say that I normally don't comment in videos, but I feel that you're such an inspiration to everyone who watches your videos. All of your videos are funny, thoughtful, and genuine. You put your best effort in every video, and it shows! So I hope you have a Happy New Year Michelle! Can't wait to see what's in store for 2016!

Awesome... Even if you have only like 20 comments, you don't answer...
What if in the Summertime Michelle or someone made a pool floatie that is like a lotus and then you can sit in the middle. 😂😍😍 It would look like those lotus candle holders where the candle goes in the middle instead it is a pool floatie and maybe like a lavender colour.
Yaaay so early love yaa

sexcond
first dislike
I love how she swatched on different skin tones , so helpful
Normally, I don't comment on Youtube. However, I just wanted to commend Michelle on recommending products that she has legit affection towards. All these price marks are very helpful.Also, I really enjoy having her share her favorite products, current trends (Trend Reports), as well as tech recommendations (My Tech Favs). It feels like having a trusty older sister. I really look forward to seeing part two has in store for us (especially in terms of APPS!).These videos must have taken a lot of time and hard work. You have my respect. Keep up the good work!
can we appreciate her for a minute? She used different skin tones to show off the colour and the products she showed works on all skin colours :)
Is it just me or is there something Therapeutic about Michelles voice ? just watching her videos is so relaxing i could actually fall asleep listening to her lol.
Great video with lots of info for your viewers :) I just wanted to add that many nail art people on YT/IG actually do not use Seche Vite because it has a history of causing 'shrinkage', meaning the tips of the nail and around the cuticle line shrivel up after the top coat has fully set, which can lead to easier chipping (and it just looks bad, and is especially bad if you're layering polishes like using nail vinyls or doing other nail art). Not all have had this experience, but many I know have (including myself). If you Google 'Seche Vite shrinkage' there is much on this topic :)
It makes me sad that Michelle doesn't smile with any sincerity anymore in her videos. I used to watch her earlier videos to find this bubbly young girl speaking about makeup with enthusiasm. It's normal for people to change along the way but her videos even though professional and informative don't make me feel like I'm listening to a friend talk about beauty anymore. There's no feeling of intimacy and closeness...just professionalism and that might be her current goal but I do need to ask myself this though: has success made Michelle Phan unhappy? Dear Mich, what can we do to make you smile again? Much love always.
J love how she added the different products on different skin tones
Michelle is ahead of anyone on youtube. She broadens horizon in the most intelligent and inspiring way. She uses girls as models (not herself) with different skin tones and sizes to make sure she reaches the mass audience and show how the products would look on them. Best youtuber out there. Thank you.
I am sure the "em" mascara and liners are great so why will you not be continuing them?
All Asians know what tiger balm is...😂
When Michelle said she wasn't paid or sponsored I was like, "Well you are rich enough". She is so awesome and humble. she could be using 100 dollar products and she's using wet n wild.
A tutorial on this hair look?!😍
I absolutely loved this video, it's amazing with so many things I want to try. At first I thought that 25 minutes would bored me, but not at all 🙌 great job, Mish.
Thank you for taking in consideration not only, price, but quality. Your video was so good and informative. And the swatcher are amazing... thanks!
It was so relaxing listening to you talk for a longer duration of time than usual. I hope you continue to make longer videos! :) I'm a big fan of many of the products you mentioned here. I'll have to grab the L'Oreal Infallible foundation the next time I'm at the store. It sounds incredible!!
That moment you watch a Michelle Phan video with only 1% battery 😂👍🏻
2016 version!
This should be an annual thing <3
I love the fact that she showed products on different skin tones, that was really thoughtful :)
I love how you show the shades on different skin tones 💘
I love how Michelle swatched the products on different skin tones!
When she laughs or smiles my stomachs does a little dance😆
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge how beautiful Michelle is?
your videos are somehow always relaxing and a relief from stressful life.
This was literally perfect for a girl on a budget... Me! I loved how you did the product swatches on multiple skin colors! like YAS MICHELLE
I've always enjoyed your reviews... especially the ones you did inside the drug stores back then.  This was kind of like that.  Very helpful :)
Her skin looks soooo good MA SHA ALLAH!
Michelle,can you please do a tutorial for your hair in this video? I LVOE YOUR BRAIDS! I LOVE YOU BABE! GOD BLESS YOU!
It's funny how some other beauty YouTubers don't post or post shorter videos because they're too busy while Michelle runs three of her own companies and still has time to upload a 25 minute YouTube video.
Amazing video! Your hairstyle is so beautiful in this video! I love it! ❤️ xoxo from France
Hi Michelle ! Can you do more pillow talks? I love your intelligence and wisdom.My Christmas wish is your reply. I love you!
So glad I can rely on a top YouTuber to actually tell the truth instead of always being sponsored!! I really love these products. Thank you for the great advise!
I love that she swatched colours on other skin shades, that was really helpful, thank you. <3
you should do yoga videos or meditation how to or something, ur voice Is like an ahh
Watching your videos fills me with a restless sense of purpose. You have managed to create a personal brand that is inspiring to say the least. I wonder if you know that the quality of work you do surpasses titles; you are an artist, business woman, motivational speaker and still so much more. The brand that you have created and the method you use to get your messages across is nothing short of an art. You are organized and yet charmingly spontaneous. You have been through so much and have managed to turn your life around. You changed my life too. I could go on, but I know you are busy changing the world – so I will leave you to it.
This is the best beauty video I have ever seen , the quality of this video is amazing , good job mich ❤️🦄
Thank you so much for this video! <3
Thank you Guy Tang for introducing me to this amazing and inspiring woman💖
Love this! And i also love the fact that you included some of your own products i mean why not? If its an awesome product! 😘
My new years resolution is too accept myself and not let anybody affect me
So many of my favs for the years, we share! Yay ^.^
I appreciate how you divided the video very organized :)
:) I really like it & your honest opinions 👍 Good stuff ! Definitely like these kinds of video's 💖
I really loved this video!! So helpful! Your hair looks so cute :)))
WHY WAS THERE AN AD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VIDEO ????
you should do a makeup storage/makeup room tour!!!! i just love those types of videos and i haven't seen one on your channel.  pretty please!!?? <3 i would love to see all the makeup you have collected
Why are the em cosmetics items not being re-formulated anymore? :(
I loved how you explained about every product.
This video was FANTASTIC. Especially swatching the products on different skin tones was incredibly helpful and I've never seen any other youtuber do this before! Also, I loved the fact that you considered different price points. Thanks so much for this! :)
Michelle is the only youtuber I trust when they talk about products
The part at the beginning where you let us "click" what topic we would like to see the most was SO helpful! Thank you so much Michelle for making such quality videos!
I love your hairstyle💇🏼
YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED , YOUR LAST NAME...ARGGHHHHH😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😄
Your voice is very relaxing.
she is so beautiful and genuine.
Love your plaits! So cute <3
Can you do a em cosmetics giveway and all you have to do is be subscribed to your channel
the swatches on all skin tones was an amazing surprise!
COULD YOU PLEASE DO AN UPDATED SKIN CARE ROUTINE? Your skin omg you´re gloowingggg
OMG !Your haircut! I'm just dyinggggg ♥o♥
I need a tutorial!
Loved this video, like always, but at 16:25 The way you poured the product out of the tube like that.... WHYYYY lol
Why do I feel like she and Dom broke up? She seems a little down in her videos...
25 minute Michelle phantom video? 

YAAAAAASSSSSSS
So they are classified by price? The first is cheap/drugstore, the second is like middle, and the last is high end? I don't really understand it.
i yeah like your makeup look
Your skin looks AMAZING!!!! 😻😻😻 Updated skincare routine? 👀
I love how you incorporate diversity into your videos.. I only sub to a few YouTubers  outside of my race because they don't understand how to appeal to minorities but I appreciate you for doing that and showing what these products look like on different skin tones! I also love that you support the small companies because that is so important to our economy and it really shows how educated you are about the world around you.. I'll definitely recommend your channel to my friends! 💞
I didn't skip a bit(wow!)
thank you for recommending  good 
products I appreciate the qualities and the price😊
why are you not reformulating the loner again?
I love coconut oil it such a amazing product, it does so may things
This is one of the best videos I have seen in a while
This was obviously the best video of 2015 😊
😂"Unicorn boogers"😂-Michelle phan
Your face looks SO much more structured. What'd you do to it, if anything?
I love how that even though Michelle is SOOOO busy, she still makes amazing videos unlike other Youtubers such as Bethany Mota. Michelle Phan deserves WAYYYY more subscribers
Lol unicorn boogers 😂😂
Tiger Balm😅 like every asian uses this🙈 including meh🙋 lol
Michelle? Are you and Dom still together?
omg!!! I also use tiger balm
 though I did not know the name it'll now! thnx!!!
Mish, I'm a full Asian and my lashes are thick and curly 😜
This is incredddddible, thank you!!!
So much cruelty free stuff in this! Awesome!
If  you really like the ABH dip brow gel, a really great dupe is the Nyx Cosmetics Eyebrow Gel  that is around 5 or 6 bucks. 
It is just as good and has a very similar color base! 
I love it, definitely try it out!!

I swear by it.
can't wait for the new makeup products you come out with 😊💕💕
I LOVE how you used three different skin tones for the swatches michelle!!
Thank you!  CARLI FAITH Skincare is the best ever!
I've been a little iffy on Michelle Phan lately but this video really made me love her again. She not only took into consideration people's budget but how each product can look on a variety of skin tones, not just her own. To be completely real, this video really made me smile😊
Why would anyone hate on her 😭 she a big reason we have anybody in our feed . Forever my inspiration . Self made , hard working , creative and super knowledgable . From her first videos making curls with paper bags to know she is so amazing
I'm loving all the LINE stickers that pop up, cute editing!!! <3
I miss your videos Michelle (I miss seeing your videos on my subscription once a week)
Mich, can you do a makeup video for this makeup pleaseee 💕💕
You're like the Beyoncé of YouTube/Beauty Gurus
love it...this video really helps me.. 🙌🙌thank u
  +michellephan
michelle i really respect you 😍 you put so much time and effort into your videos 💝 you did different price range , swatched on different skin tones , and gave detailed explanations for each product . it must have taken you so long to gather all these and put them into categories, etc . no doubt youre the best youtuber out there & infact the first youtuber i started watching . loveya mich 😸
BEST OF 2015: everything Michelle Phan 😍😍😍
I love loveee your hairstyle and NAIL COLOR in this video omygosh! Your makeup is also on point (as always) love this videooo hooray for 25 minute Michelle Phan vids!! 💕💕

OMG YOU USED LINE STICKERS IF YOU HAVE LINE PLAY ADD ME IM ((Sullivan)) SRY MY EMOJIS DONT WORK BUT IT HAS EMOJIS
I LOVE how you showed the makeup on different skin tones and how you're also the only beauty guru who actually reviews affordable makeup products. I love your videos!
First time commenting, but I just want to say I love this video. Also a line of skincare products I've been using and I found amazing, is "Sibu". It's all natural but very affordable. I have very sensitive skin and is allergic to a lot of expensive skincare product, (Eg. Chanel, Lancome etc) and these products feels very very gentle on my skin. It also has great review on Amazon!
Bless her she's so genuine, and gives such good advice!
I'm your biggest fan Michelle!I'm 13 but yeah ilysm never stop making videos, and dont let the haters ever get to you! 

xoxo Denai
I heard Tiger Balm and I'm like "WTF, THE SMELL" I instantly remember the smell. #AsianProbs
Thanks for including affordable products Michelle ❤️ looking beautiful as Always and love your hair ☺️
I feel like you're so honest about your opinion about this products.

The room setup is so beautiful, I have that diamond ban.do speaker too, love it! This video was definitelyyy helpful
I liked this video because I like how you had various skin tones. Next time please add a very dark skin tone. Thanks. The thoughtfulness is very much appreciated. And it's important to remember others, even Barbie is doing this!
I LOVE the fact that you have models of different skin tones!!!!!
I appreciate it so MUCH!!!
Thank you<3
Want to know what the second swatch down during the JeffreeStar swatches is. Help?!
I love this video so much!! The fact that you had swatches on different skin tones sets you even more a part from the other beauty guru! You have the best ideas and always quality vids. Thanks so much for including that, and the price point and quality of the products. I could gush all day about this video, but I need to stop. However, please never stop Michelle, this is just brilliant!! 
I can't wait to see more vids from you this new year!
Loving the LINE emojis, Michelle! x3
Liz Earle cleanse and polish is my holy grail you should try it
WOW how do you do your edits???? +michelle phan
Dear Michelle-- it's pronounced: SUHL-hwa-soo! You had most of it right X)

I love Jeffree Star's liquid lipsticks!
Tiger Balm is great for sore muscles too!
Love this video, it was super helpful and I discovered so many new products! 🐰💄😍
Will you do a tutorial on how you did your makeup for this video?
you look kind of sad in this ??
This video is a return to what I remember from this channel. A subscriber practically from your humble beginnings, I had disliked what this channel had become of late. Full of collabs & sponsored stuff. I started skipping videos when you brought them out, I felt they were just short and full of fluff, no real substance. But somehow I couldn't click Unsubscribe, since you were the first youtuber I started watching, years ago.. But this video, this is awesome! This reminds me of what I used to love about you :) Please keep this sort of video up and going! I'll stay subscribed for sure. Happy New Year, Merry Christmas in advance everyone!
"Unicorn boogers" 😂
omg 100% so true about the tiger balm
Your skin looks so flawless here. I love it! Please do an updated skincare routine ☺️
Would love to see a vegan makeup video. Maybe like a product review or something :---)
I watched this over and over again and still couldn't stop the admiration I have for Michelle. This is such a great video. It really helps me a lot with what I would choose to buy! 

I really apreciate that the video is not sponsored. advice and such feel more honest and trustworthy without them ads. and I also know Michelle works really hard to reach to this stage for her audience, included me.

so for all of that, thank you Michelle <3
This helped me and Jada out so much!! Thanks so much!! Amazing
YESS THIS VIDEO IS HONESTLY THE MMOST HELPFUL ONE THANKS SO MUCH MISH
I love how you incorporate different skin tones for swatches! Thank you so much.
I like how Michelle don't do a lot of sponsors and she just make videos because she loves it :) 
We need more YOUTUBERS like her ❤️

I loved this video!!! especially how the swatches were shown on all skin tones!!! that made me so happy! And it's  extremely helpful!!
Always so informative! I love the drugstore finds :)
i love how the swatches included all skin types, from lightest to darkest (well maybe not very dark, but still close). Love the inclusion!
Michelle with those braids made me think of how she looks a liiiiiiittle like Lara Croft here? Anyone else? :33 x)
Can you make these best of videos more often
The IT brow duo stick is amazing! I've had it for a while and use it everyday. Great recommendation!
"I don't know if it's like, unicorn boogers or something, but it really works" XD
This video is  breathtaking and impressive. Thank you Michelle! Can't wait for part 2!!
mish is so soft and squishy and beautiful and has the best taste I've ever seen
honestly, i really really really appreciate michelle swatching everything on different skin tones... it's just sosososo important and im sure a lot of people appreciate it :')
I died when you squeezed out all that product for the black head eraser 😂😂😂
you are my vlogging inspiration!...p.s loved all the recommended products. ^_^ xo
is that DGAF and Coconut from Colourpop?  THEY LOOK GORGEOUS. SOMEONE HELP IDENTIFY PLS ♡
THANK YOU FOR THE MASCARA!!! My lashes have finally actually gone u and not down!!!
loved this video and I loved how she showed everything on all different skin tones
I like how you're sharing your favourite products like you would share it with your bestie. Thanks! :)
oh yasSs tiger balm is the balm
So many new things on my shopping list now.. 😅
Love it, a girl could never have enough tips on beauty. I am now a fan of yours thanks to this girl. Genuinebeautyxox.
This is great, thank you for being so professional and honest with your recommendations. Also your hairstyle is sooooo cool! Love the braids!
Your voice makes my ears tingle.  That sounds crazy, but it's true lol.
I love that hairstyle on you Michelle👍...you should totally do a hair tutorial💇
This is the best video ever. She showed swatches on all skin tones, she showed products with different price ranges and she's Michelle Phan!!! 😜
loved your video!!💖 are you and Dom still together ?
Could you also make a favorites based on all asian beauty products? I realize you added some here but one fully focused on asian beauty (skincare and makeup) from lots of different companies and stores sounds like a great idea :) 

I'd like to know what you think of skinfood and face shop as well.
I love the Line emotion cons too!!! I use line more than sms😁
Beautifully edited. Loved those swatches on different skin colors. Super useful to us! The range of products you talked about showed to me, an updated-unbiased knowledge. Lots of love from Mexico!
i miss you girl I love your videos you're aaaamazing!!!! <3
Love this!!!!!!
❤️😍😊❄️😘🎄😁🌨😝⛄️☃🎁🎅🏼
this is probably the best 25-minute youtube video ever made
thank you for taking the time to share with us, lots of good  energy <3
I love that she swatched on different skin tones, ranging from light to dark. she didn't just do lighter skinned people.
I love how the different skin tones appear showing what the product looks like on them. so helpful <3
Can you make a video of how to use coconut oil?
It will be very useful for us. :D
Thank you, Michelle.
you're skin looks amazingly healthy!!
Michelle, you replied to me on Instagram. We're basically best friends now.
i live in Vietnam. I really like you _
Thanks!!!!!!!
Oh yea tiger balm,my family have 2 of those🐯
Thanks for the love, gorgeous! xoxo
I need that top 😭 where is it from?❤️
Wish she would do an ASMR video..I've always considered her voice to be very calming and relaxing 😊💗
Ur vids are always so amazing
I love that you put products on different skin tones! Such a nice touch! Thank you for thinking of us in the beauty community with deeper skin tones!
Even though the video is so long I enjoyed every second 😍love u michelle
I love your em cosmetics mascara and concealer palette! I have those short, sparse, straight, Asian lashes, too, and the mascara really accentuates my lashes. They look longer and natural, and I think the brush is great as well. I never realized how great the concealer palette was until I started using another old favorite of mine (which I still love). I noticed that my skin was more susceptible to pimples, but when I used the em concealer palette, I never had to worry about that. So, thank you, Michelle/em cosmetics!!
I'm quite early. Thanks for making this Michelle :') Are you going to bring trend reports back?? I miss them!
I think you should host a beauty talk show. 😍
Thank you so much for this share. Definitely saving, sharing, and using as a shop guide!!
awesome! thanks so much for linking everything in the description also!! i love you! <3
Barry m do amazing nail polishes
DANG! Her skin im in love <3
:) such a good vibe :)
Love your hair in this video can you please do a tutorial on this hairstyle pleeeeassseee^-^
everything is perfect <3 love Mish
I love that she used testers with vastly different skin tones. One true light, true medium/tan, and true dark. I also love that she gives SO many things in such a wide price range all with amazing quality. It feels like youtubers now put so much emphasis and praise on the really high end nearly ridiculous priced makeup/beauty items when there's so much more brands that make affordable products. Plus, a majority of us can't afford shopping at Sephora every week so I'm happy and grateful to see this video! 😁👏🏾🙌🏾🎀💞🌺🌹❤️
Thank you so much Michelle. This is an awesome video . Uber helpful. Keep crushing it. 💄
Thanks for the manuka honey tip for colds
mish, tips to a beautiful armpits, please? thanks in advance. i love you! 💕
Michelle went there and chose the best products for EVERYONE from pale to dark!
NO WAY DEC 16 IS MY BIRTHDAY 😂😂😂😃
The em scribble liner in tattoo black is my favorite liquid liner of all time! So sad to see it go😭Gotta stock up on Amazon before they're gone
I'm Tamil, and yes I grew up with the Tiger Balm x)
TUTORIAL FOR THIS LOOK, AND HAIR 😍😍
you are awesome. I appreciate all the hard work you put into this! thank you so much!
HAIR GOALS❤️🙌🏻
I was so excited about the em cosmetics mascara I just went onto your site and bought it! I can't wait to try it!!!
Hope you can make a tutorial on the makeup you used in this video.You look absolutely beautiful and glowing, yet so simple and effortless. My heart flutters!
Why are you changing everything with em cosmetics?
OMG I speak Vietnamese too! I love u michelle phan
You are a kind person Michelle and I do love your work so much.Keep it going :)
25 min of Michelle HELL YEA😍😍  I want it all :)

Hello Michelle! Thank you for this wonderful, professional, informative video! It's always exciting to see that you uploaded a video! I'm so proud of all of your accomplishments and where you are in life! You look so beautiful and your skin is so clear and glowing! ❤️
Michelle Phan is the first beauty guru on YouTube I ever trusted and I always watch her videos as I was starting to get into makeup :)
Now I have a problem with buying too much makeup :D
Michelle I've been watching your videos for as long as I can remember I just subscribed to your channel and I hope one day to be like you!!!! remember your the best
This video was very helpful! Thx! 😊
0:49 your beautiful yourself and BTW imma Viet and a female…
So much in common!
I love your hair!! can you do a tutorial on it ? :)
Hi Michelle. It's me Laura. I just wanted to say that I am a new youtuber. I love your videos and lately my skin has been dry but all the products you recommend can be pretty expensive. So I was asking what things would u recommend if we are on a tight budget. Thank you so much for ur videos, they are so helpful
Hahaha UNICORN BOOGERS?! I like that😂😂🦄
I'm loving the loreal mineral blusher it has a shimmery finish and makes your face glow.
Hi Michelle,

I love your Tattoo Black eyeliner. Is there anywhere I can buy it in bulk. It's been sold out in amazon and your website.

Thanks!
I've just started watching the video and I had to comment. For the past two videos (including this one) you've been looking tired and stressed. Here, you look miserable and this is just 20 seconds in. I just wanted to ask whether you're okay and if you've been taking care of you. You mean a lot to us. It hurts to see you so down.
I LOVE how you show what the products will look like on all skin tones
wow thanks for this video helped to to buy gifts😊
Yay! Loved this..Can't wait for the next part.
You have a sweet personality.  Thanks
i really love these videos where you just talk about products you love! So i always like to try new products
i really love these videos where you just talk about products you love! So i always like to try new products
25 MINUTES YESSS I LOVE YOU
You are such a wonderful person, Michelle!
What is happening to EM cosmetics?
Michelle is simply Bae.😽
can't wait for part 2!
can't wait for part 2!
Are you and Dom still together?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PINK DIAMOND SPEAKER IN THE BACK???😍😍😍😍
Watched through the whole video just because i love you very much! (:
You Should Do Motives Make Up
It's crazy because everything she's mentioned is literally how I feel towards the products I own haha
i love skin miso the pore serum is great too
Michelle, first off, I love you.  You are the person who got me into makeup and skincare and you're one of the best makeup artists I know of.  Can you do some eye looks for girls like me with hooded eyes?  Also I was really thankful that a lot of your products were cruelty free.  What's a good vegan foundation or bb cream that you know of?
hey Michelle! could you do a life update video? just chatting about what you've been up to or how you've been. We haven't heard very much of you lately.

Keep it up! love you <3
omg it's really helpfull!!!!
Can you make a video on how you stay healthy? And add in your workout routine, or something like that? Thanks. Love you Mish.
U look like a 18 year old so beautiful so fresh so stunning ! 😊🙌😍
That transition was hella good
Hey, could you do a tutorial for your hair in this video? I really love your braids and I want to try it out but I'm not sure how you did it. Thank you so much! 😊
Michelle seems so different now. It seems so genuine now. More than before. I love it.
Michelle!  Kudos on doing what many of the high-end beauty companies WON'T - and that is to use a wide range of palettes from white to dark and those in between.  Great video!
So informative and amazing :)
I don't want to rebuff Michelle's recommendations or anything, I just want to put my skincare selections out there for someone with combo-oily skin (if I heard correctly, Michelle said she had dry skin?). I'm still a student so I'm tight on my budget. I swear by Neutrogena's oil-free cleanser and oil-free sunscreen. The cleanser is so gentle and doesn't dry out or irritating at all, the sunscreen feels lightweight and perfume-free and doesn't break me out. My skincare holy grail (religion even) is the Korean brand Benton's Snail Bee range with toner, serum and moisturizer. They are perfume-free, oil-free, alcohol-free, water-free and just all around awesome, I kneel and pray before them every night (jk). Bonus: before bed, I use coconut oil around my eyes, especially my eye bags, coat my eyelashes with it and massage it on my eyebrows. I can guarantee to you now, my eyelashes and eyebrows become thicker and longer in just a few weeks. I also use extra virgin olive oil on my lips, never use lip mask in my life and never need to. I use argan oil after shower on my damp hair as a leave-in conditioner and after curling my hair to tame the frizz. Michelle brought argan oil into my life, thank you so much!
Thank you for taking the time to do this video. It's incredible how you put so much energy and time for your viewers!!! Love you😘😘😘
I loved that you show th products on different color skins !
Michelle! Please do a video on your look here, so well put-together.
I hate how there are ads in between the video!!!
where did u get your black cat bag, what brand, and how much?? ♡♡♡ ilysm
I love your hair like this!!! Can you please do a tutorial!!!
I enjoy ur long videos 😍🙈
Can I be Michelle Phan for a day? She's so helpful, beautiful and sweet, business smart and very inspiring. Dom is lucky to have her!
Primark has vary good quality lip sticks/gloss for $1 or 2
Most helpful video of all time right here!!! ❤️🦄
26 minutes of Michelle Phan. OMG this is heaven.
thank you so much for this
oh my gosh I love how knowledgeable you are ^_^
If some people have eczema, can they still use some of the products that you recommend?
Hey michelle! 
I love your videos especially the one you made about what glasses best suit your face shape. (I know that was a long time ago) I'm possibly getting glasses and I was wondering if you could make a video about glasses that best suit your personality! 
Thanks a million!!!!!
Your makeup gives me life in this video tbh.... Do you have a tutorial for it? Lysmxxxxx
Hey, could you do a hair tutorial on the braid look you are currently rocking in this video? It is amazing!
A powder that's cheap that i like Is true match :)
Ok I just found this channel...ITS AMAZING!!!! 🙌🏻 I love her theme and how calming and enjoyable her vids are xxx I wonder if I can watch them all...😂😂😘😘😘
I love this video! Thank you so much for the great help, Michelle! <3
I haven't been able to afford popular brand makeup due to responsibilities...Thank you Mish this  recommendations are very helpful.:)
I was just thinking about a video that shows the best products for each price range and saw the title for this video and I never clicked anything so fast in my life! Seriously, you are the queen of Youtube Michelle :) This is so well thought out and put together I am so impressed! I trust all your recommendations Michelle with you're knowledge and expertise I know I can come to you for anything make up and beauty. You're descriptions for each product are articulate and constructive. Thank you so much for doing what you do. God has given you a marvelous gift. Merry Christmas <3
I love what you did at the beginning because that was really helpful :)
The real techniques sponge is 19 AUD in Australia -_- guess the only thing we have here that's cheap is milk
hey michelle😘
you look so beautiful
and i have a suggestion , why don't you do a video of you watching your old makeup videos. lol that will br a lot of fun😁😂
just suggesting here michelle😘
thank you for having a time reading this😉😁
I got the loreal foundation, thank you! Loving it!!
You go the extra mile with your videos, they're so enjoyable to watch !❤️
Yesss I started out with wet'n wild lipsticks, love them ♡♡♡

PLEASE DO THE "BOYFRIEND DOES MY VOICE OVER" CHALLENGE!❤️
I like the way u encourage using the local product and promote the entrepreneurship. You have a beautiful mind!
please do these more often! i really enjoyed it :)
michelle i love so much you are such an inspiration to me 😘😘
michelle i love so much you are such an inspiration to me 😘😘
I love your hair can you should us how you makes that hairstyle?..
Why are you not reformulating the products if they are good??
I love how you did swatches on different skintones, and how you showed products in different price ranges. You are so thoughtful and you have the most amazing voice!
Mish thank you for those moments of arm swatching! I have a warmer brown skin tone and to see the colors on your wonderful arm model's skin was incredibly helpful. <3
I have anxiety and there is something about your voice that is very soothing. Nice video and thank you for putting all the different price ranges very organized it makes my OCD very happy! And I love the swatches with all the different skin tones! By the way you are seriously so beautiful.
🙈I'm ASIAN too .😁 . Love you Michelle😍❤️
Wet'n wild lipsticks are great, and her em mascara is amazingggg
OMG Michelle! You look so fresh with that makeup look,like if you were 20,no joke! This video is A-MA-ZING! I'm in love with LA Girl products,it's super to find them in my country (Venezuela )but they definitely worth it. Hugs!^^
oh my god! tiger balm. the best. the best
You should do a lot more of these videos....they're really helpful and fun to watch😘👌
are you related to Promise Phan?
wow..that is such an honest video..you are the best! worth watching.. thanks gal
As a 13yearold girl the only one of all these products is really Nars concealer. 😂😂😂😂😂
if u live in australia, at kmart, they have tons of beauty blenders of different colours/sizers and shit for literally $4, honestly omg
You should make more organic videos like this where you just talk with products. All of your videos are film-quality beautifunessl, but it's nice to hear you just chill and talk as if you're having a conversation with us like older videos again.
I love how she tested the products on diff skin colors!!! Most beauty gurus I watch don't do that, and as a POC I really appreciate it!!
Hi Michelle I am ten years old and I also have a YouTube channel it is called Marleigh the gymnast before I add more videos I was wondering if we could be friend because of you I have been inspired to be my very own makeup artist. Also yesterday I was sat in my very pink room when an idea popped into my head I decided to become my streets makeup artist but thanks to you I have been inspired to actually be beautiful thank you ps  as I live in the UK would you happen to know where I could by some em Michelle phan product's  thank you Michelle you are amazing
One of the best informational videos of Michelle phans video
She looks kinda sad ..
Thank you Michelle!  This must have been a TON of work!
I was looking for Some good skincare products so thank you!!! A great video! I can't wait for the part 2❤️ and tigerbalm is just amazing! I was SO sick the last few weeks and tigerbalm was just a powerful medicine!
i love you and your catty ind mines
Your nose looks so good! You look beautiful Michelle. Congrats!
you should  do a winter presents,makeup style,and fashion
I really love this kind of video.
Sit and Talk.
She really put the products in consideration, and her opinions were very detailed and very informative. I love how she is natural and honest about all the products. She's truly and honestly amazing(=^ェ^=)
Omg when you squirted the Clean & Clear product I was like 😦
i love this video so bad. Its very helpful
beautiful video! Such an inspiration and good role model
your videos are really good. I like how everything is so smooth!
Thank you SOO much for posting this video! The moment I saw it I got really excited! I feel bad because a lot of people assume that because you mention a product, that you are sponsored :( thank you so much for always putting up very high quality videos ❤️ I appreciate it and Im sure many many other viewers appreciate it as well. Thank you for being you and thank you for sharing your opinions with us :) I love this video!
The organization on this video is TOP NOTCH. Thank you, Michelle!! I know I will be coming back to this video when I want to pick anything new up. (: 

I can't wait to try ColourPop but I'm waiting for a better exchange rate. O:
TRUST FUND BEAUTY POLISHES ARE AMAZING!!
Wow thank you so much Michelle Phan! I was feeling bored and sad today but becuz of how bright and how enthusiastic you are with ur viewers this cheered me up thank you so much!
Love you so much Michelleee😘😘
you talk about makeup w so much passion ILY
V informative
Can you do a updated makeup collection?
r u and Dom still together?
your so beautiful
Ugh it makes me upset how you have to disclaim and look uncomfortable mentioning your makeup line products. You worked hard for them! I wish people would stop putting her down for her work. I love em cosmetics and you, Michelle. You're my youtuber of the year 2015 :)
Wow, really impressed with the quality of this video. I would love to see more videos like this in the future. Miss seeing you so calm and sincere! <3
Great video, but I'm just curious about the line stickers. Does this have any relation to the graphic novel you're releasing through line's platform ?
Never imagine I'd see tiger balm ointment featured in such a video! 😀
Can you do a tutorial on this hair look????
Your so GORGEOUS
This is such an amazing video! The price ranges and the different skin tone swatches are very helpful! <3
Why don't you continue to formulate the waterproof mascara when it is so good?????
Wow, great video. The fact that you showed swatches on different skin tones impressed me alone lol! Watched you for a long time, and I hope your brand revamp goes well xo
Your makeup is so pretty! What nail color are you wearing?
This is the kind of video that I've missed from you. I love the basic ones. I meant no offense 😊
Hallo! I was wondering what RiceBunny was? You mentioned it, and I wanted to know. I'm just so curious!
Umm tarte is not cruelty free
And why would anyone want brushes with animal hair? I'm genuinely curious bc it sounds gross to me
25 minutes of Miss Phan's phavorites?? yes please!!
sulwhasoo has amazing skincare products too :Q I usually use them when my skin feels dull from other products
missed u Michelle ❤❤❤
I love you so much. I was missing your videos :/
Cant wait for PART TWO YASSS !!!! This was also very nice because not only did she do the budgets but quality!!!! Who else thinks this was a good video : )
Are you and Dom still together
michelle u remind me of emilia clarke!😄😄
Lol. I just got onto the peach and lilly website when you just introduced peach and lilly xD I bought the pore mask!! OMGLOB!! its so good!! my skin is like "YAY! IM FINALLY A UNICORN!!!!" lol .
Michelle, how do you edit your videos? what applications do you use?
I love how now famous YTbers like Michelle Phan doesn't just stop on what is already a good quality review video, but always seeks out to producing BETTER ones. Creativity and content wise, SOOO GOOOD! Which I appreciate a lot! Because honestly, some people (I'm guilty of this sometimes!) tend to just stop at something when we already hit "good", and I'm not just talking about YT vids, but I guess life in general. we can always be BETTER! love it!
yasss Sulwhasoo's cushion really is awesome!
milani is my favoriteee
Few more days and its 2016! Let there be PEACE on EARTH, it all start with each one of us (here on earth).  Hope everyone will have a great Christmas celebration (for those who celebrate!)
I LOVE ur recommendations!! please do this every year!!
unicorn boogers ;P
You look nice with braids!👍👍
well, this was a very put together video and informative too., thanks^^
I love Sulwhasoo! Korean products in general are so amazing ;____;
what's that face moisture called ?
Amazing video. Love it!
please make a tutorial of your make up look in this video love u so much
Please do one of these videos on hair 😄
Mish, may I ask what foundation are you using in this video? You are simply glowing! Beautiful.
Hi Michelle,
It's weird how you say you would butcher the pronunciations because you pronounce things beautifully! I just think you should still have the spelling of the more difficult-to-pronounce brands pop up somewhere on screen (cutely like the emoticons) not because you don't pronounce it well enough, but because the extra visual aid would mean less uncertainty about communicating the brand. Thanks for reading my comment if you have. Much love <3
Is that Line stickers? Like Bony and Cony? I think it is!
Unicorn boogers made my day! :) have to try out the skin care items! XOXO
Could you do one of these for 2016?
May I specially thank you for the swatches on 4 different skin tones?! I mean, its not hard but no one does it. Thank you thank you thank you! and thanks for sharing such a wide range of colours in all price ranges
Michelle, you looked tired here. But I still love you <3 you're the best and this video is very helpful for me!
Her look has drastically changed, but I love it now!
Michelle:I don't know if it's unicorn boogers or what
Me (Michele): what gross ewwwww!
Yes my name is Michele in real life
Hopefully the second installment of this video will be "Best of 2015 Part 2: Potatoes dishes, farming,  llamas & Moonwalking"
oh my gosh....michelle,you look more and more stunning now...kiss from me,i'm your big fans <3
Yey for this!!
An advice, on the next video, you should put the name of the products on the screen
What foundation are you wearing? Your skin looks flawless! It glows but doesn't look greasy. Tell me your secret. 😍
why would you want a brush made out of real animal hair? 😩 holy shit I never knew someone could be so cold hearted..
Extremely helpful!
Great video Michelle! And you look gorgeous (as always!). Does anyone know what lip products she has on?
this is the Michelle that I fell in love with. impressive.
I rarely comment but I had to mention Your dewy look makeup  looks ahhhhhmazinggg!!! Can we get a tutorial please!
+Michelle Phan Life doesn't always turn out the way we want it,but the solution is not enchantments,magic dark arts,nor dreaming the answer is Jesus he will never leave you nor forsake you. God Bless you and may you follow the true light of Jesus Christ.
I rarely comment but I had to mention Your dewy look makeup  looks ahhhhhmazinggg!!! Can we get a tutorial please!
I'm a big big big fan of you and I inspire you
Amazing video! But I was wondering if you can upload earlier next year of video like this?

You told that you are going to refomulate you cosmetics (em cosmetics) are you also going to get rid of life palette?
Yikes. "Healing" crystals. She keeps worrying me, because she used to be a woman of faith.

I'm from Asia and I use Tiger Balm too! we're sisters wee
Better listen to Michelle girls, look at her skin, i mean i want to have a skin like that. And there is no reason of her lying anyway, she's a beauty guru and she has to fulfill her job right?! she always care for sisters out there, that's why she has achieved so many supporters and success. i don't know about you but i'm gonna add this video to my favorite and check out these products as far as i can.

<3. I still remember following her when she used to go into drug stores and pointed out her faves and hates.  Feels like the good old times again.
I haven't tried any of her em products, am I missing out some good ones?
I've never wanted to put unicorn buggers on my face until now.
I love this video!  Please do one next year too!
Wow I can see the amount of effort and thought put into this! I would love to see more videos like this from you. Monthly Favorites? Updated Skincare Routine? Pamper Routine? These videos are really helpful! The faveeee! :)

This video (and part 2) and really great. Nothing is sponsored, shows great range for prices and also includes swatches on different skin tones.  Really thoughtful video
Will you please make an updated skin care routine? Your last one was really good, and I hope you will make a morning routine as well :)
Hair tutorial plrase
She mentioned about air cushion IOPE, Hera, Amorepacific also Sulwhasoo are made by same beauty company called Amorepacific:) and also they have etude house, innisfree, mamonde etc. I just wanna let you know guys:) and also i agree sulwhasoo is best cushion even little bit expensive😍
What stone are you wearing there as the necklace?
this was really really neat!! thanks!
that's literally the first time that i heard  that someone talk about jefree star liquid lipsticks without being paid, im a huge fan😍
love this video:), and how you categorized things according to the price.
I wish YouTube was still your priority :( I know you have a plethora of other things and opportunities in your life but we're still here.
you should try paul and joe water proof eyeliner
Michelle, you should try Perfectly Posh skincare. They are all natural and cruelty free, and it will make your skin so stinking happy! I absolutely love the products!
sooooooooo loooooooooooong ima cry
I was waiting for the "good luck" at the end but there wasn't one :(((
You're still the same girl who loves makeup with the same way of describing things and I wish we were reminded of that more often
your videos are really relaxing, and it feels like your videos are not boring like other girls on youtube, I watched all the video and I didn't get bored
and that's so nice, you think about skin tones, prices
stay how you are you're really kind and lovely and... 🌸
(sorry i'm half english and french so I haven't got so much vocabulary...😅)
did she categorize It Cosmetics as Luxe? or am I wrong?
you need to try mavala nail polish! that brand makes a great colors!
And adding the different categories and telling us when each one would be is super thoughtful, as well as adding all of the swatches with the different skintones!!
Michelle is so hardworking on her vids!! she literally made an entire 25 minute video just for us!
I love you vidéo but im french (en glaise de merde)
skincare routine pleeeeeaaaaassssse
Love your braids, so pretty! I definitely need to start planning for this year end video too, 2015 has been a good year for makeup! 😊💕
Michelle do a tutorial with this ugh u look so beautiful
she seems unhappy o___O
Omg this video was sooo satisfying.
ты самая лучшая я тебя смотрю почти нечего не понимаю но смотрю
Your hair looks so good in this video!!!
I like your clip, but You look and sound tired, I think you should have a good long rest.
Did anyone see the hello kitty Poloriod camera in the background
Hi Michelle. I'm your biggest fan and so sorry that I have not subscribed to your channel. Will do it very soon. I would like you to include your boyfriend Dom in one of your video.

Perfect person? Wtf
Love the beauty!!!!

Dealing with fall outs.........
Hi! good
This video is the best
you're  very  beautiful Michelle Phan
michelle always looks flawless in her videos!
You are such an amazing women. You are so sweet and modest but still beautiful. I think you inspire young girls like me. I want to be a nail or a makeup artist when I get out of high school and you are what I want to be like. Keep it up! Sorry if this was way to sappy 😂
Can you please do a glitter force look?
Thank you for recommending products from different price ranges, that helps me a lot because I can't afford the high end products and I can't find anyone else that seems to recommend affordable products, so thank you for that. And also, it's very thoughtful of you to swatch on different skin tones, very thoughtful indeed.

And can I just say, tiger balm is the holy grail for us Asians!
<3<3<3<3
I never actually do comments but I do have a question..Do you have any sleeping packs/cream you can recommend for us?
I love the face next to her anyone agree with me
loved the video! manuka honey is Supposed to be over hyped though, apparently plain natural honey has the same properties and it's less expensive, I'd recommend researching it before buying :)
Are you related to Steve Phan and he has a wife called promise
you are awesome
What lipstick are you wearing? Love itt
Hello Michelle! I truly hope you see this because I feel that something have changed you and there are so many questions going on my mind since so long I really don't know how to start but there really is one that I keep thinking about and its... 
What happened with Dom? 
obviously its not my problem but since then its really that I feel like you've  changed:(
hi this is very helpful  what color can i use. thank you
Jeffree Star is a big beauty supplier today, not really a small person 😂 lol
Your skin looks perfect Mish <3
Just a question, do these brands animal test? I try not to use brands that do so.
Puppycat!!
love your lip color in this video! ❤️
I love them braids
I love your accent
i have been looking for something like this and this is by far, for me, is one of the best!
Michelle!! can you make a video about chemical burns from the use benzoyl peroxide?? :'(
loveee your look!!
Dear Mihelle i want to inpress this guy his name is Kyle by drawing a REALLY good photo what should i draw
Omg I've missed your vids so much! I've always find them very relaxing ^^ I do hope you will make video's more often in 2016 ^^ I love how much you've grown with youtube and business wise too! You were one of the first yt-er I watched! I believe that the Sailor moon tutorial was the first video that I've seen of you! And was subscribes ever since ^^
Tiger balm is great but do be prepared to be stopped by the TSA when you use it.  It sets off the paper test they do on your hands that detects trace explosive ingredients.  So that means nearly every elderly asian.
Loved swatches on different skin tones..Awsome video!Love yea Michelle!
you look so cute in this vid!! :) so cute! cant get over it :P
how did you do your hair?? so cute
Are all of the products in this video cruelty free?
Tarte was bought out by a not cruelty free company... which means they are supporting animal testing. Just wanted to clear that up. They might not animal test themselves, but your money goes to a company who does.
Okay mish where did u go???!I missed u so much!!!!!!!!!
I love wet n wild lipsticks. I got mine at Wal-Mart for 75 cents during a sale, and at first I thought it'd be cheap n not that good, but in the end they turned out to be gr8💄
i LOVE the milani baked blushes!! I've hard such a hard time finding a good drugstore product that will compliment my olive/tan skin but the baked blush that I bought has a tint of gold with the pink which is amazing and does wonders. Theres no real need to spend so much money on high end products for everyday makeup routines when the drugstore offers really great dupes... but they may be harder to find
michelle please make a tutorial about how to wear a tooth positioner with confidence.i know a lot of girls watch your tutorials a lot of them are young highschool girls and  they want a smile like yours but they are afraid and think how people will make jokes and stuffs like that.i think will be very useful if you give some advice how should be the makeup the teeth routin and how you take care of your smile.thanks.love you
Love this, my favorite video from her in a long time.
unicorn boogers
U can get beauty blender sponges from TJ Max for $3-6
Seche vite = dry fast in French.
I feel my 2015 savings going down the drain... 2016 splurge it shall be
Her voice is so calming, it slightly puts me to sleep
Michelle where did u buy ur LA girl pro concealer cause I can't find it anywhere
I have asian lashes too. Compared to my friends who are not asian they have really long voluminous lashes. I thought this video would bored me but it was very entertaining. Great Job Mish.
LOVE the dewy look, I am really obsessed with it! What foundation did you use?
Excellent video- I love how you gave great recommendations for each price range since many of us can't afford a lot of high end beauty products. <3
WOW!  All I can say is "thank you" for this comprehensive review.  I have added it to my favorites list so I can refer to it whenever I need a new product.  Merry Christmas!
Okay does anyone know what the kawaii sticker/emojis she has through the video are called? So cute but I can't find the name or anything anywhere!
Can you make an everyday makeup routine with your favorite makeups?
2 years later and I'm still waiting for your makeup line
michelle, i have asian lashes too its so frustrating to try and find the right mascara for my lashes but i cant get your macara😞
can you make morning routine
And hey, can you do another ASMR video? You could mix it into a tutorial maybe?
i love your video so much you have help me with my life and you inspired me so much
the makeup you wore in this video is so pretty💗💗 you should do a tutorial on it:)
Such a relaxing voice she has
I love your hair here Mish! 😍
"You can pat this on *slaps hand as hard as possible'
крутые покупки
YOUR BRAIDS!!!
This is sooo helpful! Is it just me who's writing all the recommendation michelle has said in this vid? hahah
I love your braids😸☺
What color shade # do you use for the L'oreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation?
Well I'm logically asian but my eye laches are to thick
are all of these brands cruelty free? :/
I want to thank you Michelle Phan of making this video! This is just for me!
i really love this.
It take a long time and I still hv no improving in English. Hope that you enjoy your winter season.
I have never watched a beauty related video that was put this much effort on.Even though I dont watch her videos on a daily basis I must be blind to not appreciate and applause this video.
Thanks Michelle you are the bomb!
what lipstick did she used!the colour is amazing~!
i love you!!
I love your spirit  . I really love you.
Also ,,fouettè'' means whip cream 🍥🍥🍥
I hate how people get so mad when people who have makeup lines, clothing lines, etc. get proud and happy about their product. Of course they're going to be happy. They made the product. It's rightfully biased. They wouldn't make a product that didn't meet their standards. So when they do make that product, and their standards are finally met, of course they are going to talk about it and show it off. It's common sense.
I think it's great that Michelle Phan shows us the different Colours of lipstick/eyeshadow on different skin tone which makes its easier for people like me to see the Colour swatches. Thumbs up 👍🏼
You know you're so asian when you always use tiger bomb
hope m cosmetics will reach philippines soon
what can i use to clean my beauty blender with besides the custom soap they make?
Michelle your hair looks great!
Hi Michelle  I love your videos, and your styl. I love how you are so happy and calm. You are so open with your viewers. You are so truthful when you do videos like this, and when you do videos I am right there watching on the screen, I hope you have a great day! Watching your videos always make my day!
Love love love how she uses different skin tones for girls or guys who have darker skin tones very awesome and thoughtful
I love how Michelle swatches the products on different skin tones so every one sees what it looks like on their own skin. Beauty gurus should do this more often tbh!
Hi Michelle, this is i guess my first comment ever on youtube and all i want to say that is you rock girl!! You videos are not only informational but they are life changing. I dont know how you do it but I actually feel at peace after watching them. I  can just feel the aura, the positive vibes and the tranquil state of mind you put us in. The genuinity of your approach towards the things u use really shows. The love you have for them, like they are not products but things with feelings. I guess i could go on all day with this but all i wanna say is you move something inside us, like wake up our spirit animal or something. This all comes from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much Michelle Phan. We love you :*
Hi Michelle ..I was wondering what your opinion on the Chantacaille rose water is ?
when she just squeezed all that cleanser on to the table...
She broke my heart when she mentioned morphe brushes and promoted animal cruelty 😏
☺☺☺💙💚i love u and your videos so much u make my day who else stops everything they do just to watch michelle i do☺☺💙💚
Is Dom still with her??
Здорово ! Очень классно снимаешь !
I love michelle's smile and laugh soo much.
who else watched this video just to stare at michelle phan cause she looks so pretty here? well maybe that's just me :(
this girl is crazy hot
you are literally ethereal
the way she pats the foundation hahahahahahahahaha
did i hear unicorn boogles? lol
Michelle please do the makeup routine
Michelle the nail drying product actually disclaims that it may cause cancer and should not be used with pregnant women.
Michelle I love this video. Can you please do more trend report, I miss them.
can I use foundation as concealer?
"MakeupGeek is VERY affordable" -said no one ever! OMG like a palette of 9 eye shadows are 50 dollars!!! That is rediculous. I would never pay for that.
I find it a little ironic that the makeup she is recommending is really inexpensive and it's great quality...yet her makeup line is up in the clouds and nowhere near as good.
I want ask about arm ,if we have a problem under arm .how to make our arm always clean & beautiful?
i feel you with the asian lashes -.-
anyone can see you have put in so much effort for this video, bravo Michelle for this awesome video! x
I love makeup but I am to young to use it
i use tea tree on my (sorry it's gross) white acne spots and it makes them desappear! also alum stone is awesome on every spots you have. i made my acne half reduced with these lovely guys. hope you understand me. 💋 from 🇫🇷
Michelle where is dom these days
i love that you showed the products on different skin tones bc it's so hard sometimes to gauge as a lot of brand use light skinned/paler models than my skin tone.
Thank you thank you thank you for showing the makeup swatches on various skin tones!!!! <3
Hey Mish, I hope you are ok, you look so sad lately. Hope everything is fine with you.
Halo Michelle, i'm tika from indonesia. What kind of brush the beginner should have? can you mention it for me. Looking forward to your answer. Thanks ^^
great video! i would be so happy if you brought back trend reports ^^
great video! i would be so happy if you brought back trend reports ^^
I like Michelle's voice it's soothing 





Im a weirdo
Is there any products for oily skin?
祝生活愉快.
hai mish, i really loved and enjoyed all of your video.i really wants to know what camera and editor do you used to make all of your video? hope you will answer it. love yaaa
PLEASE DO A HAIR TUTORIAL😍😍😍😍
Jeffree Star isn't a small YouTuber or has a small business lol have you seen his Instagram and his fancy cars
whats the lip color you are wearing in the video??plss name it...
It's honestly so amazing that you put in so much time and effort just for us to really get the best tips! Thank you!
Blue lipstick ?

Love u
Love u
Where do they sell l.a. girl, other than online??
YOU NEED TO MAKE AN UPDATED VIDEO OF THIS PLSSS
Manuka honey really is amazing, my father had cancer in his throat and he swears Manuka saved his life. My household will never be without it.
where can you get the items
Tiger balm ruleeee! Hahahahahaha
You didn't even use some of the drugstore stuffs here.
what the name of concealer is? (01:15)
I noticed you say sorry alot in this video. No need to apologize. Love your videos by the way.
What shade is her Anastasia Brow Pomade?
Confused about why you would discard your liquid liner after it took 2 years to formulate? Why throw out all that work to start again?
Nice touch. Really enjoy listening to you. You recommended some of my faves. x
Michelleee are you going to make an autumn goals video?
Is Em already in the Philippines?
did anyone notice the puppycat plush?
oh， no ！why stop making the mascara and eye liner？？？
Greaaaaat video
I love these kind of video
Yep, the Sulwhasoo cushion is pretty good!  I just wish they had a larger color range.  The darkest one is still too light so I gave it to my mom-- it's a stunning product though!  She loves it!
Michelle I'm Vietnamese too. I'm one of your biggest fans. I really want to meet you. It's so cool how we are almost alike💯❤️🙏😍😘
wet and wild in the uk?
Okay for drugstore lipstick companies I highly suggest revlon
Hooray today's my birthday!!!
I love your hair
you're awesome! No bias! You are amazing!! Please keep making videos! I wish I could meet you one day and get some advice. But I'll wait ~ HAPPY NEW YEAR!
Michelle swears??
Hey michelle i really miss your vids! Anyways if you could plz make a video about how to look good without makeup or any products! Hard Challenge huh
Big fan
Why is she going to stop remaking her current products??
i hope thats not how you apply cushion foundation on your face cause damn you were smackin 😂😂😂 but im so happy that youre here on youtube representing vietnamese girls everywhere, keep truckin my dear 😚
DKM with tiger balm
This is a unique video.
우옼 한국인 나뿐인가?
her voice makes me want to listen more even tho i dont really like stuff like hauls.Its the kinda voice of a professional you can trust :)
What about the best of 2016?
I personally LOOOVE the Sulwhasoo Cushion Compact. I have really dry skin so whenever I use a cushion compact, it sort of just sits on top of my skin and looks really cakey or splotchy. But Sulwhasoo's really gets into my pores and feels like skin.
The only downside is that sometimes if I wear it the whole day, the fragrance becomes a little weird.
Amazing video love you
Yas! Tiger balm we had that Asian beliefs which was spreaded across the nation I use it when I had a itchy sorethroat  sometimes migraine or runny nose even when I have a fever plus I love the scent of it and the maroony-orangey color haha! #Philippinebased
What is Michelle's hairstyle called? It's so badass and cute at the same time. :0
I like your hairstyle!!
Michelle, your trapezius muscle looks great in this top!! Have you been working it out?
I was going thru my liked videos and she popped up and i'm having major nostalgia and it breaks my heart she hasn't posted in 9 MONTHS
definitely will be coming back to this video for what to buy myself   xD
I love this video 💕
you nice
She is goals
Michelle is actually so beautiful though
My yi or grandma, ALWAYS  use tiger bomb 😂. My grandparents room smell like it 😁😂
Michelle, I love the products you recommended, but I was wondering if you can recommend a blush for a fair sensitive skin I would really appreciate it because I'm struggling to find a good one :)
Happy new year
すごく参考になりました。
私もM コスメが欲しいのですが日本では買えないのがとても残念です。
いつか日本でももっと気軽にMのコスメが手に入るといいなと個人的に思ってます。
Hey Michelle what is your channel address for all of your videos?
what does the tacha sunscreen smell like?
I love michelle phan.she is so awesome for doing very lengthy videos like this thank you michelle!
lovedd it
How much you paid for it big hello from me
Can you make a video about make up brushes?
Michelle does not get enough credit but she's awsome
Hi Michelle, what lipstick are you using?
what lipstick are you wearing? It's so pretty :)
Something seems off about her make up in this video? Like it's incomplete or something is missing lol
Can you do a hair tutorial of the hair you have now?
I miss your videos!! Love you so much!! ⭐️❤️👏🏻💞🦄
before this I tried honey but probably alrdy mixed with other ingredients or added more sugar in it, I breakout so bad and I stop believe in honey. a months later idk what makes me try the honey again but I bought 100% honey and slightly more expensive than the before and oh my god its really makes such a big different in my life not just for my face but also my health!
Plz. She just talking about the best makeup cuz other makeup guru talk about it. She wants get on and get more view
This was a really good video. Great reviews , with different  skin tones. Nicely done.
i always wanted to buy seche vite cause i was so tired of top coats that took up to an hour (!!!!) to dry, but i never got around to it. after watching this video i went out and bought it and was sooo surprised about how fast it dried! i hadn't even finished putting a top coat on all my nails and some were already dry! and i also have a problem where my top coats always have bubbles and it would make me so upset but with this i have no problems. i reeeeally recommend this
love all the swatches on different skin tones! !
oh and btw Milano is made in Italy but it's Not SOLD in stores..just online T . T
Can you please make a prom makeup and hair prom tutorial. It's my 2nd prom so pleaseeee
I always love how she uses technical terms not just like it doesn't leave ur skin dry. She is so inspiring because a Vietnamese like myself is not really recognized and I loved watching her since I was 4
This is really a useful video, finally a useful video! Thanks!!!
I got the it cosmetics universal brow pencil in my ipsy bag and it is seriously my go to when I just want to fill the thinner parts of my naturally thick eyebrow.  I simply love it.
Mish are you going to make any halloween videos this year?
i love u Michelle. . u r awesome. .
"Awesome video" and "thank you for the candid sharing" are all I can say. Some brands are hard to catch though - can someone please share your notes?
I'm going to get so much hate for this.. But I HATED the dip brow. I like the brow wiz a lot better and a swear by it. It looks a lot more natural with my Asian hair eyebrows..
Leuke video michelle! Ik weet dat (denk ik) niemand begrijpt wat ik schrijf! :p
The advertisements were pretty annoying but over all great video Michelle. 💜
I have very similar out fit what shoes should I wear
Koreans don't traditionally use tiger balm
tiger bammmm!! love it
omg where is that cat handbag from? the one on the shelf.
I love your videos 😍😍😘
I love you soooo much
I just want to say thank you for having swatches for a range of skin tones Michelle. That is really awesome.
why ive never seen Milani in Italy. where can I find it?
I love this video
So far I've loved what your makeup line has to offer. However, my main concern is whether your products are tested on animals or not? If not, will they continue being cruelty free products?
Michelle! Can you please do the 3 minute makeup challenge
I want to be a rice bunny so bad
If I was on an island I would bring food,my electronics and clothes
coconut oil in coffee? I know some will fridge full fat coconut milk and extract the water, and just whip up the fat/cream of the coconut and use that for their coffee....not coconut oil...
Ohh my gosh what's the name of the kitty purse and bullet thing they are awesome !!!!
روعة
Wtf your Beaty blenders 20 bucks???? I got the same exact one but mine is a $1.25 so your wasting your money. But I still love your channel and your amazing
she look so different now,but i still like her. :)
Omg love this video !!!
can you pleas make a girls guide part 2 ?
Michelle!! I'm such a big fan of yours and I constantly refer back to this video every time I'm wanting to try something new. Hope you do one for 2016! 😊
💎💎💎
all of the products look so new! like she only used them once or something
Dat hurrr
I'd like to think I was jotting something down for gifts... but really I just want to spend my Christmas money on these recommendations, ahaha. Always love these sit-down videos from Michelle Phan :)
I love her hair in this
How come your not going to re formulate some of your products
Can you do a really dramatic makeup look?
This video should be called, "How to spend the Sephora card you got for Christmas".
Please avoid recommending products with microbeads in them, such as the Clean & Clear scrub. Microbeads have been proven to be extremely harmful to the environment and have been banned in countries like Canada, and a new law bans them in the US in a few years.
I honestly love Mac Cosmetics, I think it's quite nice quality and I don't understand why girls (where I'm from, Canada) call it's basic or trashy. But eh, I can afford $34 foundation so bye. ☺️
What do you use to edit is it free?
14:37 yess beat that face honeyyy😂
Does anyone know what is the name of that black cat purse in the background?? or where can i find it, ITS SO CUTE.
I need that mascara now,,, I have Asian lashes because my mom is Asian but my dad is British and I live in Canada! I have a more caucasian face so yes I need this mascara!
Are her and Dom still together???
YESS QUEEN
❤️
Bee and puppycat!!
Where did you get your necklace?
PLEASE Michelle, make one for 2016! I always love hearing what your favorites are :)
when is the first helios femina chapter coming out?
I quite of died when she said unicorn boogers
since u keep talking about how u r asian, what type of asian are u? im vietnamese
Being honest here and not trying to be rude at all, but I feel that Michelle hasn't been being herself. Don't get me wrong, I've been with her since her Barbie and Lady Gaga tutorial and I will watch all the videos she will upload, but I noticed that she kept on saying sorry for not doing anything wrong. She said sorry for dropping the lipstick 😹. I know that I will get hate for saying that and yes, I know she was just being polite, but she should just relax. 
         Also, it's okay to be biased or not, because there will always be that person who will make a mean comment about whatever thing you say.
Your Hair Tho...Too Cute!!
If These Were Your Faves Of 2015, I Wish We Would Have Been Able To Try Them In Our Ipsy Bags.
(I Receive 2/Month)
-xx's
michelle, what's your snapchat? :)
I wish I had that much makeup !!!
why do you like other brands makeup and you don't only like yours?
The worst part is that I am watching this video while I know that i will not buy any of these products because there aren't here in Greece ! I'm really jealous .
Okay PAUSE for a while, Because i will watch this together with my sister :* We love you Michelle ♥
she looks so good in this video
I miss Michelle :(
hey Mish, I've been a fan of yours since your first videos, and I need some help. I'm a panda (black, white and asian) and I have been trying since I was a teenager to find makeup that works for my skin. I've finally found foundations and powders that don't turn my skin pink or orange, but I've never been able to find an eyeliner that will stay in place. I've tried everything! apparently my eyes are really moist, and as soon as five minutes after I put my eyeliner on (usually just after I finish all my makeup) I look in the mirror and there are black smudges on the inner and outer corners - even with waterproof liner. now because of my particular eye shape and size, if I put makeup on without eyeliner, I look really silly. is there anything you can suggest, product or technique, to stop the running of the black?

Doesnt she work or made a makeup line named em?
I'm Asian don't know what that is
i really appreciate this video. it reminded me of why i started watching in 2009 to begin with
OMG Now this is the Michelle i love. i really love the way you split your categories INTO CATEGORIES!!😊 and you showed like different skin colours which is beneficial as your viewers are culturally diversed  so thank so much for making this wonderful video and i hope you make more videos like this :) 
Also as usual, your backdrop is simple and cute and your hair...omg so healthy and lovely. i could go on and on about the pros of this vid but overall i just wanted to say... forget the haters and keep being you :)
Does anyone know the name of the bright gold eyeshadow shade from Makeup Geek shown on the darkest skin tone at 2:56? Would love to buy that.
So u know how her old videos are all in subtitles? Well why? Is Michelle being sued?😱
Can't wait to see your new makeup packaging!! Hope it looks similar to the 'tatcher skin mist' it looks so magical haha, your last em packaging was a bit plain but cannot wait to see what new magical designs you're going to use💞 love you x
I know this has nothing to do with the video but I almost lost my right eye contact and started freaking out until I saw it on my mirror thank god.
I WANT THEM SO BAD!!!!!!!!!!! UGHHHH!
michelle can u do a kpop related video it would be awesome if u do !! love ur new videos a lot!!!
what's that the pink diamond behind
Is she still dating that guy?
Omg Thank you so much for the thoughtfulness of all the quality products..I've been searching for all of the great things just for this year. I'm goober excited to go out shopping and find all of your great suggested items as all of the hair care help was needed. Thank you so much your beautiful..Happy New year keep up the great smiles and work blessing to you from little town texas. Thanks again:*
Arghhhh adore your complexion so much...I've never getting bored to watch your video...you skin is so flawless especially on your forehead and then you attract my attention on your thick eyeliner..thumbs up michele please do share your current skin care product..
michelle looks so sad in this video :( is it just me? (pls tell me it's just me lmao)
It's not in korea only tho. Its all over asia. Dudeeeeeeeee
Where can I find manuka honey ?? Like, do i find it in the supermarket, a pharmacy, or what?? please, someone answer me :(((
did her and dom break up?
Michelle's skin looks a little oily here. Not hating of course, it's just different to see a Youtuber that does not overpowder their face just to appear oil-free on camera.
Please
where is your lipstick from? love the colorrr ❤️
im surprised limecrime is not on the list
still watching in 2016 just for mish 😍😍
I was always wondering, if the product is great and successful (like Michele's mascara/pencil for example) why stop production? Why not to make it into permanent item?
Hello Misha! Thank you for your honest opinion and your time for making videos. I know that you are very busy and that this year is so hard for you and your team and I wish you stay strong and make your great brand and your channel even better.
what i love most about this is that she is showing the different colors of the products on different skin tones and that's really helpful, inclusive, and thoughtful
Make up geek and Michelle Phan Collab needed!!
Is that puppy cat i see?
She talks about these products but it doesn't seem like she knows that much about them.
how did u do ur hairstyle?
I want that cushion!! but so hard to find in my country -_-
why would u want real animal hair on brushes ? im just curious btw ylsm michelle
is she still with dom?
is she still with dom?
I  love makeup and Michelle
She says that they're a bit expencive but they are 6$ each!
22:56 First time I heard Mish say a "bad word" XD seriously though...
She reminds me of Hilary Duff a bit :)
I love how Michelle truly cares about her viewers and her videos are very good quality but recently I've noticed that she doesn't smile or laugh as often as she used to. Her last video was 9 months ago.. If you're reading this Michelle (You probably aren't though..) I would just like to say.. Thanks. You're videos are SUPER helpful! If your stressed or anything please take your time and continue making amazing content.
Thanks for reading,
Jeanette
Missed these kindof chatty videos soo much ♡♡♡♡
her arms are so fit
the Keen
I'm so sick of hearing about her own freaking products in her videos!!!
I so wish all of this was available in india:|
Can we please get a house tour:)
I am pretty sure someone already commented on this, but Sulhwasoo is one of the Amore Pacific brands! Like you said, among the amore pacific brands (innisfree, mamonde, laneige, espoir, etc), Sulhwasoo is on the top tier in terms of price and the target customer age. It's wonderful that you mention this product, because not a lot of young women know what an wonderful job it does. So kudos to you!!:D
I don't think Milani is an italian brand, it isn't sold here! Maybe they just used kind of an italian word
I have Asian lashes as well and no matter which mascara I use it doesn't work! I want to buy your waterproof mascara but it's too expensive to buy and ship :( any tips or advice?
wet and wild
Is there a tutorial on her hair in this?
I love they showed how the colors looked on different skin tones.
So much chemical...
I am sure fouete means cream
Dont misunderstand me but did you have a nose job or is it just the power of make up? if its so can you do a make up tutorial on how to thin a nose? Sorry for my English. kiss from France.
is she still dating dom
My mom has your masscara brand
What lip product and color is Michelle wearing?
Love your videos!
I love how beautiful she looked even when she kept talking and moved her lips so graphicly yet naturally 
does Singapore have Wet n Wild products though?
Love you Mish! You are a legend!
You look like catniss everdeen in this look
Why is Michelle always so perfect ??? Her skin is honestly dream. I'm so struggling with the ugly pimples TT_TT
Hey michelle! I am such a huge fan and I think you are incredibly gorgeous, clever, and smart! I have a huge favor to ask you, which I believe is imperative to protect our beautiful planet. I think that role models and celebrities like yourself have so much power to do something good for the planet. This new movie came out a couple months ago called cowspiracy(on Netflix) and is an eye opening documentary directed by Leo dicaprio about global warming. This movie has changed my life and changed the lives of everyone that I have suggested to watch it.  I was wondering if you would watch it, and see how you feel about it, and if you find it important, make one blog post about it or just a short feature in your video. This documentary can really change the world(like blackfish did). I think that this is a great opportunity for you to use your following for such a great cause. You're the best! Thanks for being such a great role model!
I still miss your videos!!
Michelle, Thank you for the reviews. I always enjoy them -- esp. the Halloween-costume makeup tutorials! What do you think of BareMinerals Complexion Rescue gel with SPF compared to the popular Asian/Korean mist cushions (examples: Sulwhasoo, Hera UV mist cushions), which are also supposed to give off a *light dewey, fresh finish? (I was looking at BareMinerals CR as a more "natural" option.) If you have a natural option suggestion (pref. with SPF) for the popular Asian mist cushions, please let us know! Thanks.
Does anyone know where I can find the shirt she's wearing in this video? I love it so much. (Loved the video too, but I love all of her videos so I'm not surprised)
Please do it 2016
when do you make videos??😓

Did anyone else have 3 ads play during this video? I couldn't figure out what was going on. The vid would fade and a commercial would start and then the video would pick right up again.  Weird.
Are you aware that you promote animal cruelty-products? :(
MISH I MISS YOU WHERE HAVE U BEEN
in my opinion, wet and wild lipsticks are just plain horrible. The colour pay off is not that great, and they dry out my lips like crazy. Would , personally , not recommend. Sorry xx
I wish my mom would let me get makeup she just gets me those expensive small makeup pallets I only have one and I love makeup..any plans that can help me convince her..?😫
Great video!!
Is it just me or does she seem sad.

Please get Snapchat
What did you use to make your face look so dewy?!?
We miss you
What does mass, mid, and luxe mean?
I have been a subscriber to the Ipsy Glam Bag for quite a while and look forward to receiving my bag in the mail every month.  I wanted to thank you for the extra gift in this month's bag.  I absolutely love it and look forward to seeing what looks I can create! The surprise was unexpected, but wholeheartedly enjoyed.  I kinda squealed like a fan girl.  It's endearing to see the interest that you maintain in your subscribers/follower.  Thank you for all of your inspirational videos and Good Luck!!
Are you wearing lash extensions?
💛💜💛💜💛💜
Michelle do a video 'how to start using makeup'. Because nobody want go one day to school wearing no makeup and the next day look like Kim Kardashian on a red carpet. I personally want to start wearing makeup but I don't now were to start and with which produces to start and use. I'm a teenager and I need to cover up my pimples and oil skin. And i want to look naturally . 
So please please please do a video about that!!🙏🏼🙋🏽😊🌈
AWESOME VIDEO MICHELLE!!!!!!!
put tiger balm on mosquito bites. It is the only way to stop scratching.
2019....?
pliiissss subtitles
Is there anyone here who uses "line"?
Mish your lip color is very pretty. can you name the brand and the color tone.
cool
one thing i really appreciate is the diversity she showcases in her videos :)
This video was honestly so helpful. wow I love Michelle so much.  with her help I'm going to actually succeed in makeup (its hard) I've been watching her videos since 2 years and she is a successful, helpful youtuber. (her talk to me videos have helped me with depression) ♡
I want you to come back to YouTube !😣😢😞
I am sorry but those Sally Hansen gel-like nail polishes (with black bottle top coat) are worst than normal. When I wash my hair and do some dishes they last one day :(
am i the only one who thinks Michelle looks different? not like bc her hair is different but more like she is glowing? she is beautiful i think
What is the name of the duo chrome white eyeshadow by make up geek?
I have missed your videos so much. When you just sit down and is so down to earth <3 Love from sweden
really loving this! and unicorn boogers lol
Love the hairstyle!
LA girl in the uk?
When we say "paraben free make up" what does it means and why other make up put paraben on it?
hi
نص متابعين ميشال عرب وهي ماتتكلم ولاكلمة عربي
I'm not sure if I agree with the Nars creamy concealer. Every review I've read said it covers great but for underneath the eyes it settles into fine lines and creases. I would suggest buying it for the face but not for underneath the eyes. If you want a really good under eye concealer buy $6 dollar Maybelline "fit me" concealer. BEST out there and cheap
I wonder how many ppl came to her channel bc her last name is phan from Dan and Phil XD
Have to admit she has 8 millions of subscribers for a reason. Thumbs up Michelle Phan!
So little views...why??
Um, i don't get it?? Does it mean tht you're gonna redo everything in your makeup line??? Or just redo but everything is different? Like packaging the colors????
what type of brush did you get?
What lipstick are wearing?
why would you want a animal hair brush!!!????
I am Vietnamese and michelle PHAn is my star
Are you Vietnamese right?
I have a really light skin, like porcelain. Even the lightest foundation shades of the make up brands are turning orange on my skin. Do you know any adorable ones that come worldwide in porcelain colour?
I wish i could splurge on nice fancy concealer... my skin color changes so easily, i have to have a bunch of different shades of concealer and it adds up if you buy the nice stuff! i have a tube of covergirl that i got at walgreens and i have so many mismatched shades of BB cream, so i just add those to it depending on what my skin looks like at that time lol. im asking for new concealer for xmas :)
does anyone know what shade of sulwhasoo michelle uses?
YAAASS VEGAN CRUELTY FREE NAIL POLISH 💕 thank you mish 😘
It is almost a half hour video but I def didn't find it long at all because I'm totally absorbed. it is so well edited, honest, informative & her voice is unbelievably relaxing.

Good luck, Mish❤
Perfection you are a really professional you tuber 💕💕💕
yes haha tigerbalm 😂 aaaalways
Oh yeah! Tatcha and the Trust Fund! Green brands for the win!!! Thank you for this long and nice video =) Also, coconut oil is an amazing ingredient for all kinds of beauty DIY.
Your hairstyle here is just O.O <3 A hair tutorial would be amazing!! It's been a long time since you've done one as well, so it would be so nostalgic ^-^
Why are u not reformulating em cosmetics?
You are so down to earth and just your voice is amazing!
I really missed your old beauty videos so I definitely enjoyed this one :)
Can't wait for part 2! also you look stunning in the vid as well as your skin. :) it looks so dewy n healthy! :D
Hair tutorial please 💕
Am I dreaming? 25 minutes with Michelle? OMG YES!
you are sooo cute and thanks for the tip about the waterproof mascara because i'm half chinese and my lashes are also very thin and are growing straight 😂❤️
For your next video you should add the prices
Legit taking notes
please don't promote real animal hair ... they're dogs who get skinned alive and i adoooore you but please don't promote it ok ? thanks 😘
i had a feeling she was going to reststart with her make up line :D
super helpful video
Loved your video
da gel nail Polish is a complete waste of money. one day its pealing off
I've just felt that "old" Michelle is back. I prefer this kinda video.
Thank you for showing the beauty products on all different skin types!!!! Yes!
Hi, I have a job now, and wanted to buy your products, but you don't deliver in INDIA ..........
As now you have full control do something about it..........
XOXO
Exactly what I needed before my finals 😂😂😂
i love this new kind of video!!! And the editing is very coool! Love you Michelle <3 <3
Thank you so much I actually bought some things that you recommended. You're very honest about stuff and that's what I really appreciate about you. Not gonna lie your my fav makeup and beauty guru EVER!💕
I've been following you from day one and I'm just as in love if not more than I was when I first saw you. I still remember all of your tricks with rice, your scarf video and just everything. I feel like I know you :) total fan and friend in my fantasy :P
Yesssszz!!!, I feel so Asian when you mentioned about Tiger balm and Honey as medicinal purposes.. High five!
So pretty!
Loving your hair like this !
Your skin looks flawless! Can you please do a makeup tutorial on this look, or at least list the products you used to achieve this look?
I love your necklace! Where is it from? :)
I miss Michelle so much..u r my inspiration love from malaysia..
the best are michelle videos!
@Shion Endo
Ily 💕
can you do more videos likes this in the future? i mean this is great for the holidays and we get to really know what is good and what you like without the sponsering or such. ^.^
uuuuh girrlll that blue eyeshadow on black skin is POPPIN! 2:25
i tried avene cream because i had alergies and i swear on my life it helped me so much with dry spots and itchines and pain so its very affective ^^
Hi! What lipstick did you use in this video?
This is exactly what I needed. Amazing review, great products and so happy to see you face :)
holiday makeup tutorial plsss!!!
love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 more of this plz
YOUR VOICE IS JUST SO CALMING I CAN'T!!!!!!
beautifully filmed and edited as usual haha
I havent wachted any of your videos in a while, but this is great, you look so passionate about beauty products and knowing what you are talking about. Lately it seems to me that youtube is only about hauls and finished products or vlogs, and I miss the times when the gurus shew us which product was worth it and which one wasnt. Not trying to offend anyone, I respect a lot the people who makes videos, but in my opinion their porpoise is changing. Glad to read that you are taking full control of EM. Thanks for this video and forgive my English, as I am spanish.
I lllove your hairstyle! ♥.♥
You are so pretty! Your videos are like therapy to me, I really like your voice :)
unicorn boogers!
I love Jeffree's music
WOW that was so good and useful
your makeup is so glowy and natural and fresh in this video. also this was super detailed, i'm going to have to go back and note down and research so much of this stuff. this kind of stuff is gold, it'd be great to get these even every 6 months or so.
I can't stop looking at how glowing you are. Your face, your body and your great personality make you glowing even more! Love this video...
Hi Michelle! I wery love your videos! Pls do morning routine and nigth routine.
You look beautiful Michelle ! Your skin look awesome!
please make one every year:D!!!!!!!!!
Oh the irony of Michelle Messy-Colorblock Phan gushing about the 'blendability' of eyeshadow ...
What does she mean she's not reformulating some of her products? What's happening to her makeup line?
Do you guys know what hairstyle she is wearing? PLEASE HELP!
Michelle, the tiger balm that is sold here in Canada is white.  I don't trust it because I remember as a chidl using the original TB which was a mustard/brown colour.  I notice you have the brown one.  Where did you get it?
unicorn buggers!?
ugh michelle you are sooo cute!😙
I looooove how you edit your videos, you're very original!
You always put so much effort into your videos!! So amazing!!💗
cries coz my bae uploaded and slaying as usual
Ughh loved this video... but very pity I reckon maybe some on it or most of it not sold in Australia... :/
Such a good vid -by far my fav video of yours 💖💖
PART 2 PLEAAASSEEEE. OMAYGASH!!!! LOVE U MICHELLE
I really love that you're showing the products on different skin tones! I can't recall any other beauty-youtuber who does this.
if the liner is the best one youve found why not keep it? aww:(. cant wait to see the new products you bring out! x
Cicalfate is NOT a moisturiser, it's a healing cream, it helps healing eczema, acne scars etc... but you need a moisturiser afterwards.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate this 25 minute video
I like that she didn't over saturate the video this time. It's nice to see your true skin tone Michelle!
看完这个视频要开始担心钱包了
her voice is so calming...^-^
i hope to see more vids like this ms. Michelle (^___^) or some trend report (|_____|)
This video is definitely a game-changer for the industry, a wonderful idea Michelle!
you know... i really do love michelle shes the og
"The small people"... Watching the comments roll
What is her snapchat?
do you wut kids
You look a little sad. I may be wrong. love you so much Michelle Phan❤ loved loved loved the video
Yaaaas Mish! You looked so GORGEOUS! I can't wait for pt.2 😱😍😍
I love that you have swatches on various skin colors woohoo~~~ 😍😍😍
Thanks Michelle. I am excited to try new products.
It's pronounced seol-hwa-su  hhh
I aways love your backgrounds, it would be awesome if you did a video telling us how to do it cause they always Goals xx also this video was amazing
loved this!!
You are so beautiful, and your videos are flawless.
I need to know what's on your nails!!!!!!
Michelle, I wish you could do more "normal" makeup tutorials. Your makeup in this video is the most beautiful amongst all the looks I've seen this month :O
I love the swatches using different skintones.
Thank you for including women of various skin shades - it was interesting to see how makeup pigments can look so different when applied to different colours.
Hey there!
I use Cicalfate on my face because of my acne scars! it moisturizes my face as well!
I SWEAR BY IT!!!!  Avene is an awesome brand!!!
Awwwwww Michelle is back <3
yessssss
her voice is so relaxing...I mean it actually helps me relax.. ⊙_⊙
Beauty guide for guys plssss
This might be random lol but in 2015 I really got into Korean & Japanese skincare products like yass get on my face :) & benefit's Hoola is literally life ugh!
about the "toupe matches every eyebrow color" thing is wrong. gingers have eyebrow hairs that basically match their skin tone and it's hard to find a product that matches
I can't believe Michelle hasn't posted a video in almost a year.. where is she? I miss her :(( I've been watching her since I was 7 and she did a barbie makeup tutorial - I'm not even joking... I hope Michelle starts posting again.
hey mich, can we have video for this makeup look?
Always wanted Michelle to do monthly favourites. Was dissapointed because she doesnt but then she slays me with this video. <3
i looooove how you made people with different skin colours get the swatches bc it's more accurate and helpful
I wish i could get just one reply from you !! Huge fan of urs..love you loads !! Love from INDIAAA 😘
I LOVE Avene. I have very dry skin and their face cream is the only one I've ever liked. So I was really happy seeing it here :D
You're the cutest i love u so much💜
Tiger balm is the shiz :D
you look so beautiful!
YOU. ARE. THE. BEST.
Great video Michelle :-) keep on doing such videos.. it was so helpful☆★♡♥¤
25 min Mish video?! DON'T MIND IF I DO Your videos give me life <3

anyway you're awesome mish.
Michelle is flawless omg

The quality of the work you do is fantastic.Thank you!
please do a review on the best korean makeup/skincare <3
Mish reminds me of Jessica Alba, idk y 😂💜
This was such a helpful video! Thank you!
Investing $25-$30 on manuka honey was the best decision I've ever made. It too has helped me both for health purposes and skin care.
So great that you show how the colors look on different skin tones! Great video, as always <3
Mish you look amazing in this video! 😻😻
YASSSSSSSS! A 25 MINUTE VIDEO!!!!!!

puppycat
Michelle, you put so much effort into these videos, I hope you know what we really really really appreciate it :)
OMG, what colour is the gloss / lipstick you're wearing, and where's it from?
I know Michelle is really busy with her makeup brand and her businesses but I wished she did more videos on YouTube because they're amazing and I really miss the old Michelle... Hope she upload more in 2016 :(
wow
This must have taken forever to film. Much appreciated and much love sent your way x
1:00 it's a little thing, but i love how you showed what the colour looks like on a range of skintones :D
"this is only Part 1 so stay tuned for Part 2 in a few days" IM SCREMAING
i need to say its a really good edit tho :)
Extremely helpful👍😉

Hi, makeup amateur here! Michelle, you kept talking about different undertones. What are those and how do I know which kind I have? Thank you! <3
Great video!!

I have the matching intax mini th hellokitty
+Michelle Phan  I live in Canada and i absolutely love your Em cosmetics line! My mom, a Ipsy subscriber from the start got your amazing  Shade Play palette in Madagascar Taupe and it is by far my fav i was wondering if i can get some of your make up from your website shipped to Canada because i'm not sure if you do that? i also want your eyeliner and one of you life palettes. If you can't we should make it a thing. Anyway, love you very much and keep on inspiring everybody!
MY God! How can you recommend animal hair brushes? I'm fed up with Michelle promoting animal cruelty cosmetics. Unsuscribing.
I have wet and wild I have 3
Those LA pro concealers have tonnes of parabins in them, those concealers can cause cancer
Thank you for including swatches on different skin tones! I hope I see more longer videos of you in the future <3

I see Cassey Ho's +blogilates book in the top left!
this video made me realized how much I've missed Michelle :')
best video michelle!!
I like the bh cosmetics sponge its $8 because of tax/shipping but if it didnt it would be $3.50 and its very soft and doesnt soak up all of the face products
I hope you upload make up tutorial soon
"I like supporting the small people". Lol @ the unintentional shade.
I noticed that You never Say The name of The Colors You recommend for lipsticks, eye-liners etc... Why is that?
💗（＾ｖ＾）
great click ahead addition (y)
What's happening to Em cosmetics? Is she selling it?
Bee and puppy cat! :)
Clean & clear blackhead scrub does not work at all for me I've tried Alonso ever black head cheap scrub for me and nothing works idk what to use and I can't spend a lot of money
This video is so informative, creative, and organized. Thank you for this!
I love this video so so much (idk why it's just so relaxing I guess)
Your hair is looking awesome👌🏼😍
Gah I love your videos so much ❤️ so much perfection
French braids look awesome on you😻
THAT UNIVERSAL BROW PENCIL FROM ITCOSMETICS IS SO GOOD
I missed watching your videos! ♥
Loved the video, Michelle. I'm definitely going to try some of the things you recommended.
Unicorn Boogers😂
Show the products in differents skin colors is something great! congratulations for that idea ;)
even with a busy schedule michelle still tries to make high quality and well organized video. Love you mish <3
This video is soooo precious. I'm definitely adding this to my favourites so that I can refer back to it whenever I'm down to use some new products! :)
don't buy from Jeffrey! he's a huge bully. a customer commented on Instagram about his lipstick called abused saying that it might be triggering for people and the customer got blocked.
I love you, Mish! 💖
Any suggestions on what to get my bf for Christmas?  cx
I cannot pass any part of your video. watch the whole
nose job
about the morphe brushes. there was a post where a lot of people were complaining about the sets saying they weren't good quality as the singles and that they were damaged (I think). so get the individual ones instead of the sets. oh and morphe deleted the post bc the tea was too hot.
C có phải người việt không
Michelle looks so cute😃😃
Ugh, well-organized videos are the besssssst! Great job Michelle (and company)! ;D
Love michelle phan. Loved showing the products on different skin tones
Omg best video so helpful and informative!!!!
Ur skin is glowing,,, SO PRETTY
"i don't know if its like unicorn boogers or something but it works" Michelle you always turn my frown upside down <3
You are so genuine, i could listen to you all day. Thanks for this video, it was soooo amazing!!!@ love you ♡♡♡
i miss you! hahaha love your hairstyle! reminds of star wars for some reason..<3
Such a great list of products! many of the products you picked are my top favs as well, specially those wet n wild lipsticks. they are amazing  and sooo budget friendly for sure. thanks for sharing all these goodies! I want them all! lol
Btw your braids, so cute! plus you are just glowing! Bella as always! sending you lots of hugs chica! 
much love,
Kirsy
I love these kind of videos from you! <3
This video was amazing from the  swatches in different skin tones which helps a lot, to the different price ranges and the usual calming effect. Just beautiful.
What is on your face ? Your skin is immaculate like an angel!!!!👼🏻
Please do a holiday present guide! I loved last years!
I love your simple natural makeup in the video. Please show me how to make it. <3
What does she mean not reformulating?? Restocking ??
did she say "rich bish" ?!?!?!? I i didn't know she swears
Is she still dating that one guy?
is she still with her bf?
is the hand in the imddle for the lipstick a neutral skin tone?
I'm so happy you included cheaper stuff as well as luxury priced items. Can you please do this but with fashion items and brands? That would be amazing! I love it when you do fashion things like ootd but you tend to use expensive items in those videos so I think it would be awesome if you dig deep to find those nice and unique but affordable (doesn't have to be cheap) clothing brands.
what a wonderful video !
"Support your local economy." ? 
How about support your animal cruelty- free companies :)
I love your hair!!! i WISH I CAN TIE MY HAIR LIKE THAT!
Avene is the only brand that can cure my dry skin. That brand though <3
Please do more of this video Michelle!! Thank you so much ❤💞
Thanks Michelle That was So Helpful
It's been so long since you make such videos, I definitely miss youu.
you are so beautiful 😘
Yes yes yaaaaaaas these type of videos r my favvv
i love you Michelle Phan 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
You are amazing!!! I love this video.
The skinmiso blackhead remover pack is amazing!
I love how long this is, I also love that you were kind enough to put links to skip ahead:)
I really prefer yearly favorites over monthly because that means you had all year to make sure they really were your favorites
I love your hair! Great video! 💗👍🏼
i think the foundation you're using is too warm toned for you
You look so unhappy here :( nice video as always
you can also use cilcafate on cuts it helps to heal it and your less likely to scar......trust me
thanks !
I hope part 2 has gift ideas for guys and girls who aren't really into makeup and beauty and such
I really need a great product for my forehead ace although they are not that bad in a way that I need a doctor but they're every where , any recommendations ⁉️
Where do they sell LA girl?? 😫😫
Michelle, could you do a skincare routine video? Your skin is GLOWING!!!!  🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️🙌
Love the swatches on different skin tones!!
Your necklace is so cute!
Michelle you're everything goals 😍😭
Tiger balm is like my mum's holy grail 😂
Listen to Rosegold by PTX!
Gosh gurl your skin is amazing!
Gosh gurl your skin is amazing!

OMG best video ever!!! normally when beauty gurus recommend products I don't trust them one bit, but Michelle makes me wanna buy everything that was mentioned in this video lol

Thank you so much mish I've been freaking out on what to get my friends this year!
Bihhh lol "I rather have GPS, superman..." you killed me.
Awww I really  miss your videos, but you never failed me with 25 mins video! love you!!

Ik this is of topic but is Dom still her boy friend just saking not hating

I love this long video! Please make more long videos!! :)
I'm so use to scrolling all the way down the suggested section to read the comments and now the new update have the comments on the bottom of the video😭😭.  (touchscreen problems)
yassssssssss
Great swatching! Awesome and very helpful video Michelle! Happy Holidays! ❤🎀
Is em cosmetics still around ? Why is she reformulating her products ? Does anyone know ?
By "not reformulating" does she mean she's not making it anymore?
I tried the NARS concealer and didn't think it was that special, did I use it wrong o_O
I love you, your so organized and living and pretty!!!
Such a great and helpful video!! Love ya❤️
Loved the tips! Omg never stop learning! Xoxo
l would like her to use the cosmetics of Etude house and tonymoly
so helpful!!!! thanks Michelle
Love it! Skinmiso is actually on my amazon wishlist I first saw it on wishtrend the demo looks phenomenonal!
wait what is happening to Em cosmetics?
You really need to make more videos Michelle!!
I was really unimpressed by DL nail polish.  It was actually pretty bad, very thin, poor pigmentation.  :-/
I love this video so much, just curious on why u decided to start EM all over again?
Part2 please.....
Thank you Michelle. You have inspirated me so much. Watching all your videos, I feel like... Loving myself more, love beauty and everything about make up. ❤️❤️❤️🙆😍
We love u😘😘keep it up
I love the nars concealer. I have super pale skin, but I have a yellow undertone, and sometimes is just white. It is amazing, and it matches me. The IT Cosmetics CC cream is amazing also!! It comes in really pale and oxidizes well (I have tried others like Maybelline's BB cream and Physicians Formula and all turn orange on me).
She has changed so much from her other videos
Errmergerd I love her hair
Hey guys,

Since this is a beauty channel I wanted to ask some questions about nails. What's acrylic? And what's the difference between the acrylic full set and just the acrylic? I'm sort of a beginner so ANY info will be really appreciated :)
Thanks :D
Waterproof mascara and liquid liner by em cosmetics are my fav. Totally agree with you they are awesome!
Is it me or is she less smiley than usual? She just looked really sad :(
Yessss loving Michelle with these braids 😍
I love this video. I've been watching you for years and have never seen anything like this!
THIS IS SUCH A LONG VIDEO AND ITS ONLY PART ONE I LOVE THIS AW
your skin looks luminous! what did you use?
your skin looks luminous! what did you use?
Jeffree Star lipsticks are also vegan and cruelty free
What lipstick are you wearing? <3.<3
Thanks you so much for the video! I'm from France and I didn't know a lot of the product you show in this video. Now I think I'm gonna try some of them! ^^

(Sorry if I made mistakes, my english is far from being good.)
I´m looking for a polish like this for years. Oh, God, it´s so cute. I like everything.
Michelle, you should do a tutorial for her hairstyle in this video!! It's so cute
Michelle, please do this every year!
is it just me or does Michelle remind anyone of Aliee? I guess I am alone on this.
I don't understand why you wouldn't ask Dom to help you with the French pronunciations. Please do so! It makes me cringe every time I hear beauty gurus struggle with the pronunciations.
Yayyy! Super miss you Mich..
Surprised she endorsed morphy brushes and they make ones made with animal hair.
Which site is best to buy the peach & lilly product on ebay or amazon? Well I know they are both safe but i want to know if they are legit like has someone bought one already before? If sooo where? Lol
What does she mean we she says she's not reformulating her products? Is she scrapping her whole line and starting again?
HAha so true xD When I was a kid and had a block nose or tummy ache or sore feet, tiger balm was my mom's solution to almost everything!
Michelle Phan for 25 minutes? I think yes. 😍
Hair tutorial please! I love that hair!
gr8 video! hair tutorial please!!!!!!!!11
I can agree on the Waterproof Mascara lol. I have bad sinuses and my eyes water insanely, so the mascara stays put.....
this video is really helpful <3 thankyou so much Michelle xoxo
Love this😍😍
Production value on this and just sheer usefulness and everything else. SO EN POINT MISH!!! Thank you for the recs.
"Unicorn boogers" hahah 🦄
Michelle just makes the best video out there
Your hairstyle looks so good on you! Very unique look
You're still the best makeup guru that I know! ❤ You're so creative, Mish. I love the way you speak and think of better ideas to make it into videos. ❤
MICHELLE DO HAIR CARE ROUTINE

Yay !!! U finally making a video u don't know how much I cryed not but I miss u Vietnam rules😍😍😍😍😜😜😜😜🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
one of my favorite videos. mostly because you talk for 25 minutes. this will help so so much
Most hilarious video ever 👏 totally reminded me of that Hotels.com commercial: #CaptainObvious. Haters please hold up though: "I love her soooo much and she looks totes amaze in this video." So chill...
I like how she wasted the face wash
***CAN YOU PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON SHU UNERMA?*** (I LOVE THIER PRODUCTS FOR SKIN, BUT NOT SURE WHAT THE BEST STEP BY STEP PLAN WOULD BE..) if you haven't tried this brand, it's fantastic. =)
I went on Sulhwasoo's website and the cushion foundation is like $60 😂. Oh also, eventhough Tarte is cruelty free, but I think the parent company tests on animals so it doesn't really justify the whole concept of being cruelty free.
25 minutes of awesomeness
