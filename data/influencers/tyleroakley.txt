wanna fall down the rabbit hole of Mamrie/Grace/Hannah/Tyler collabs??
ENJOY: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL29MYs08TJ6O-1N247X4AZ2UGJoAsa_yt
omg it feels like I traveled back in time when YouTube was all about collabs and friendships and not drama 😭
WHY AM I SO EARLY this feels like 2013 again
"I heard that Mamrie Hart spends bitcoin on being choked" ICONIC
i seriously love how the very first “rumor” dragged james charles lmao
A playlist is EXACTLY what I needed.
this video slung me back into 2014 and i'm OVERJOYED about it.
you ever miss 2014, when youtubers were just  friends who liked to laugh??? bc same.
OLD SCHOOL COLLABORATION!! YESSSSSSSSSSSSS..... These four ALWAYS make me cry laugh!!!
Holy trinity + Tyler please save us from this dumb Youtube drama. Amen.
this made me feel really nostalgic for some reason and i'm loving it
Omg the drunk crew and tyler, love um!
This reminds me of the good old YouTube days when content creators made videos simply because they genuinely enjoyed it and not because they want to be rich and famous and this makes me very happy. I haven't felt this happy watching a YouTube video in the longest time. 💕
an edward fortyhands collab with all of you please and thank u
Bye bye new kids on the block!!! Hello old YouTube!! I've missed you so much!
Ah the nostalgia if only Kingsley was on this too. This is a breath of fresh air in an industry full of toxic people.

Okay this is such a throwback video I was convinced it was an old video recommendation????

The last time I saw all of them together... I can't remember. Also Tyler's uploading regularly and I'm livin for it

I love you all and this needs to happen more often. I’ve been watching you all for years, everyone’s career is changing (naturally) but y’all have the best chemistry together! When y’all collab these days, it’s very reminiscent of the old days when y’all did it regularly. Bring back the wacky made up games for all the weird holidays we celebrate in the U.S.
😭💘
Hit me right in the feels.

I need a Joe Sugg and Tyler Oakley reunion now. Imagine Dianne and Tyler ‘fighting’ over joe 😂❤️
I know I’m late to this video and its a gem as always... but the Edward 40 hands will forever be my favorite collaboration video ❤️
for years of listening to you talking about pokemon on the podcast to this, wow
bro enjoy the video and stop talking about dan and phil. he’s obviously excited abt this and y’all are gonna upset him
Everyone in here talking about phannies and I'm thinking they're talking about when Tyler had padded underwear
phannies we are really going to be boo boo the fools
Omg, Tyler This is so incredible!!!!! I was excited about this movie before, but now I can’t wait to try and spot you!
omg that’s so exciting, i’m so happy for you! i’m basic my fav is pikachu, it’s just so cute 🥰
are we not gonna talk about how good tyler looks like,, all the time?
Lmao, R.I.P to all the Phannies who thought it was about DnP 😂
this is so cool and such an amazing opportunity!! hope you had the best time + my favorite pokemon is teddiursa! <33
Tyler, I can't believe you're in London and I love your personality!!!
I feel like if Tyler ran a Gym or was an Elite Four member he'd either be Fairy or Electric based. Mostly because of the energy and vibes I get haha.
I like to think his main pokemon would either be Sylveon a Fairy type Eeveelution, or Ampharos with a mega stone. Cause like Tyler they're both cute but powerful. 
Also my favorite Pokemon is Charizard. COME AT ME!
The phandom is truly shook at this one
Phannies rlly be insert how to put on a clown wig tuturial
I’m now excited for that movie because you are part of it and you get to be in it 

So, I can’t wait to see it and hopefully find you in the movie

I love you Tyler! 💛
Good luck tomorrow Tyler on the  Amazing race With your partner Cory
Wow all the phannies with hella theories, I'm sorry
the clownery this caused,,,,, happy for u tyler tho sksksk
Can confirm, my friend who worked on this (In alterations) showed the makeup designer my eyebrows and then gave suki waterhouse pink eyebrows.. 

NO JOKE. AM LIVING
phannies get ready for the biggest public humiliation of 2019 here we go
all those phannies are an embarrassment to me😔 anyway congratulations tyler ilysm!!💞
I've already been excited to see Detective Pikachu movie but now I'm MORE excited! 🤩💛

Also, my favorite Pokemon is either Ninetales or Eevee.
Can’t  wait for this masterpiece
Tyler Oakley x Detective Pikachu 💕
Phannies have given up all hope of ever seeing Dan again.
I just got 10x more excited for the movie!!! I'm so glad for you! I can't believe you kept this a secret for so long
So lucky.  I'm sure you had a marvelous time.  I want to visit London again.
Where are all my growlithe/arcanine fans at? The growlithes in the movie were so cute and fluffy and the Arcanine was so cool to.
boy oh boy phannies we going down
YAAAS to everything in this video!! Wooooooo Tyler!
Someone needs to let Grace know that movie star Justice Smith loves her a lot.

Pika Pika♥ I'm jealous
I know this is a year overdue, but in you revisiting you high school video you visited your language arts teacher, the reason I know this is because she was mine too. Last year, my freshman year, you (off camera) came into her sixth hour class. I was there. I was sadly too scared to say hi.  So..... Hi
🤡🤡🤡
squirtlezard
yep
geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Jesus Christ oh my god that was a video
You look like super Mario after he has gone through a very rough time
you've reached a new level. however, im not sure in which direction (kind of like the letters lmao)
abe lincoln sung to sleep by a jigglypuff and jigglypuff wrote magic marker on his face.  anyways, you look good, either way.
When you’ve had a rubbish day and then you see Tyler’s video! 💯
definitely abraham lincoln after he was drunk and he passed out and a toddler took a sharpie to his face with a man bun
Post Malone's timid younger brother who dyes his beard and goes to drunk tattoo artists EXCLUSIVELY.
I’m giving you Abraham Lincoln Emancipation Proclamation realness 😂😂
you should transform into queen jackie
You should do a Brendon Urie transformation you already have forehead stretching experience at 1:15
(the live stream sent me) & omggg you look like Post Malone’s nerdy little brother or something hahah I’m living for it! 😅
Still in school but came over from the live stream! I love you so much, thank you for everything 🌈 

Thank you for making me realize it’s okay to be more comfortable with who I am 💕
Tyler lookin' buff as hell😍❤
maybe goth drag? idk ily 😂
Yaaaaas TYLER. much love honey. Also first 💖❤️
Why does this only have 20k views?
He kinda looks like Marc Maron fell off the wagon and went through a mid life crisis.
How do you know when you've run out of ideas?


Tyler:
Dead channel lmao
Damn look at those ARMS
Here from the Livestream 😂 this is my favourite face morph ever😂
The tattoo of the animal skull on his throat actually isnt finished because it hurt so bad, he kinda gave up and didnt bother completing it lol he said so in an interview

The live stream sent me
Never been this early 💖💖💖
this "transformation" ain't it sis
I'm sorry Tyler, but your transformation looks like Jigglypuff took a marker and scribbled all over the face of a hipster from the Pacific North West.  I'm giving you a gold star for trying to write in reverse, because that is HARD.
When are you coming to india next?
Oh lord a day, Ty. lmao love you
Middle America Jesus 😂😂
Post Ma-Go home
This...is a lot...and I live
I’m just chilling here on my couch watching u guys fish in the amazing race

im not gonna lie,, the neck tattoos actually look decent
The live sent me love you too death
i love u🥺💓
I love u bb <3
Youtubers always write on themselves with sharpie but why doesn’t anyone just use washable pigmented black eyeliner
I wanna see you as Dame Edna
If Abraham Lincoln had a man bun under that top hat....
It's that kind of terrible that it's actually great
2:47 nnaaaahhh idk if that looks so good, kinda looks like a five year old painted all over his face. But Tyler is a little gay five year old some times
post malone into you
This really happened? Hahaha
Love your great laugh!!
NOT MISTER MALONE
I love that he just does it himself. help? We don't know her.
Hey, I live in Mason, MI, which is a town over from Okemos. The crazy thing is that the Asian Buffet in Okemos is my absolute favorite restaurant. I love Chinese food and they have such a variety. I also saw a picture of you in there and was wondering if you also enjoy their food?
oh my- 😂😂😂
Insta live love
scared you’re gonna go blind
Your hot I’m not gay
You from amazing race
5:22 a wild Frenchman appears

Looks more like Vinny from Jersey Shore.
Wait... what?! 😳😁😁
You became better now
Loved this video

Transform into Hannah Hart
The abraham one buddy lol

His laugh at 7:12 😂😂😂😂😂
luigi...
hi Tyler
what a video
❤️
I came here from the livestream. How have I been following you for like 10 years and had no idea you had tattoos? You and Jenna Marbles can literally do anything and I’ll love it.
#IDontEvenLikeTylerOakley
Oak Malone
Oh my...first of the first tat almost spell a** (sorry tyler) then understandably its difficult to write in front of mirror. Until Tyler drew barb wires...he looks like ready for Halloween as a Frankenstein Harry Potter hybrid that is really hairy? Hahahaha
LOL
I’ve only 👎🏻 Bc Tyler... girl why?!???!
Its my dream to collaborate with you!you inspired me to start my own youtube channel on which i put up singing videos
!!!!????
I can’t 😂😂😂
Yikes....
I’m a little tireb today...
Dem guns though...
This is such a cool video
Hi
Abraham
Why the hell would you do that? Smdh
im sorry mr malone
Post Malone looks like he doesn’t shower
Reminds me of childhood
Hahaha!!!!!
Itsa me, Post Malonio!
why
Abraham oakely
Last time I watched your videos was last year. Today I come, I noticed you just get old... that wrinkles on your cheeks and mouth... omg so quick
wtf
29k views?! Girl, your channel is dying!
Dang
lol is Tyler Oakley still relevant
Ok but I did it first 😤
this is why Tyler is not an artist youtuber
Great content idea. Bad execution.👎🏽
Isn’t it weird that just a few years ago, this would have gotten a couple of million views
hi woah i feel like i was transported back to 2015 with this video
Feels like 2016 again. Feels good.
“Peppermint?!” Stop that 😂😂😂
Honestly the most surprising part of this whole thing to me is the fact that neither Tyler or Hannah managed to get ice cream or milk on the floor during the filming of this 😂
When you can casually just call up Halo Top to send you 28 pints of ice cream.... same🙃🙃🙃
omg this reminds me of the "guessing the canned items" challenge or whatever you did which was my first introduction to the two of you and i'm crying.
I literally went on a Tyler and Hannah video binge last night and now you're back together? I'm so happy
“this has been a weird day for our bodies and minds”
“i’m drunk”
😂😂😂😂
I'm glad to see Tylers plants are still alive
loving the reusable metal straws
I'm a dead and in heaven !? Or is tyler back again !????
The comments
90% I miss the golden years
9% ice cream convoy
1% me
Ok but Tyler's got some solid arms 💪
looks at flavor without glasses cant even see the Pistachio 😂 but ily hope to have awesome supporters like you!
“One of them is gingerbread!” So confidently 😂😂
I love how he says I'm going for something a little bit cold when they're all cold 😂😂
tbh this is one of my favourite types of video for you, theyre always hilarious
Metal straw! #SaveTheTurtles
3 hours and 12k views 😳😳 Tyler what’s happening??
What do you call a silky smooth cow?



SMilky sMOOOOth
So I'm here thinking "What in the heck is Tyler going to do with all that leftover ice cream"?

Mainly because I'm craving ice cream
I think your lyft pool is here 😂🤣
The Green Tea Mochi is actual trash. I was so excited for it and it just tastes like hairspray...
Wow! Tyler's getting hotter all the time. Too bad that I am on the wrong end of the country! :((
I feel like I traveled back to 2013...I like it.
all these milkshakes are making me want some.
I have never wanted to try Halo Top ice cream but after seeing this video, Im definitely picking some up when I go grocery shopping today. Love this vid! :)
Dear god, that last one was fruitier than James Charles.
Just want to say hello. Also I feel so unoriginal because my favorite ice cream flavor is sherbet. I am watching this at work and am going to go buy some of these flavors when I get off work because now i want ice cream. 💕
This is the content I need in my life
“Good luck with your life. Please leave my home.”  I’m going to start saying that to my friends when they visit me.
Instagram sent me! Love you both❤️
I was in junior high when I first watched a collab of hannah and Tyler... I'm half way done with uni now... helloooo😭
Hi! And I'd say a good chocolate chip cookie dough, rocky road, and bunny tracks are my favorites.
my ONE (1) guilty pleasure is ice cream 
wish i could relate
more like anything chocolate
This combo ALWAYS brightens my day 😊❤️✨✨✨
Was i the only one that went to " peaches and Cream " by 112 after the video
This is so pure PLEASE KEEP COLLABING WITH EACH OTHER I AM LIVING FOR THIS
First?
Instagram sent me!  I am living for this!
Have we traveled back in time?  I missed you two together and these types of videos in general <3
Miss these two together! What a wonderful surprise! 😊
Loving this collab and haven’t even finished watching it yet 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is exactly what I needed today! Great video. Both of you are cute.
Tyler.... a halo top? Delusion.
hieeeee
god i want to try that blueberry crumble, that sounds amazing
u are really really POZITIVE!  good luck for u.
I missed these! Love you're guys' colabs! Real throwback to when I first started watching your videos ♡
The content we deserve! Thank you! So happy the universe brought us all to this point with these 2 souls! My favorite flavor of Halo Top is either Oatmeal Cookie or Caramel Macchiato but I haven't tried most of the flavors y'all mixed up today!
Hi! That was fun. Btw, love your plant corner
RIP headphone users during the blending process :>
Wait what? This is THE SAME apartment that Tyler lived few years ago? I barely recognised it damn, the flashbacks.
OMG AN OG COLLAB!
Hi, I love you both!! My favourite Halo top flavour is mint choc chip 😍
Hi Tyler, Hi Hannah!!! That was cracking me up!
YES! aluminum straws☺️ MUCH APPRECIATED!
You Two look like siblings! But, it doesn't make me want any Halo. $$$Expensive$$$.
LOVE Halo Top! So light and fluffy, I need to try these other flavors o:
high.

And I like the oatmeal cookie flavour, I think. We don't get a wide range of Halo here, so I haven't tasted enough to judge. Definitely want that blueberry crumble one.
Is halo top expensive in the US? These are AU$10 each in Australia and we only have like 4 flavours (that’s all I’ve seen anyway)
OK I LOOOOOVE THIS ITS SO FUNNY! MAYBE I WILL CHANGE MY NAME TO TYLER OAKLEY FAN! LOVE U SO MUCH TYLER!😘😍😍😁
Cherry from quality dairy!!! Michigan love ❤️❤️
Pistachio Almond with lightly toasted nuts...
My fav flavor is called “Andy’s Ice cream” it has graham crackers 🤤🤤🤤
I forgot this channel existed💀💀
"roll the footage" :'D <3
also: "hii"
Anything cookie-dough-related is the best type of ice cream, in my opinion. That oatmeal cookie flavour sounds AMAZING!
Right after the video ended I looked up at my TV and there was Hannah on Ellen and I kind of freaked out déjà vu!!
The amount of innuendos in this video!!  So happy to see Hanna and Tyler together for a collab!!  
Old YouTube!!
This was flippin' adorbs. Thank you!
Love this kinda video, you guys are great!


I'd love to be able to get half these flavours in the UK. Blueberry Crumble, Peaches & Cream, PB & J all sound immensely good!
Was just thinking yesterday how much I missed watching collabs like this then this pops up,,,,, love that for me
I missed this duo honestly
What a duo and what a modern throwback! This kind of video is actually pretty comforting
"Hannah hart, please leave my home" 😂 😂 😂

Also, I'm going to make a milkshake because I have a lot of ice cream, and I'm moving today... So I need to eat it all. Wish me luck.
Hannah's shirt I'm in love
Love seeing you collab again!!! This is great!
"it's making my eyes water" 
"for why?!" 😂
Hi Tyler why were you such a jerk to Hanna boiiii
This feels like the internet is back in its prime oh my gosh. Love this!
Watching this makes me feel young and old at the same time, I feel like I'm back to 2013-2014 but then the reality hits that it's 2019 now
Hi :D
Also favorite ice cream flavor? Hmmm butterscotch!
This brings back so many good memories! Love these two together
I love those glasses on Hannah!
Love you two separately. Together I can’t handle myself! Ps Instagram sent me.
I love this!!! 😍😍🥰🥰
who tops ben or jerry. sorry for making u read & consider this
11:58 OMG I was thinking that as well; the 112 song! Great minds think alike ;) Loved the video Tyler! <33
congrats to hannah baybeeeeeeee for her new series on Ellen!!! <3
Not fun at all but my favorite ice cream is just a plain vanilla with a few strawberry slices and some chocolate syrup. Also maybe circus animal cookie ice cream
Love you two together. The dynamic is just so natural
I'm out!
You've been out for years.
Hope you win amazing race I subbed for luck
Hi Tyler!!   Love you beyond words!!
hi my fav ice cream flavor is a Cincinnati classic: Edna's Blueberry Pie
I love that you were using reusable straws the whole time! Way to set a positive example for your viewers!
It always fills me with joy when I see Tyler and Hannah have done a new collaboration video~
Hi 👋🏾 I love pistachio and would really like to try that pb&j pistachio combo 😋
these are the vlogs I long for, I need all four of you together again and again and again... love this
10/10 watched this whole video just wishing all the flavors were also dairy free / vegan. Like BLUEBERRY and MATCHA halo top share the wealth with your local lactose intolerants
HI


favorite flavor has to be birthday cake or blue moon
you should try asmr! keep up with the trends lmaoooo
Yay loved this video! You two are so great and was a lot of fun :D Made me want some Halo Top now haha
I love seeing you two together because nothing feels forced at all, and it's still wildly entertaining. Like I'm reuniting with old friends. =)
all of them sound amazing!
Tyler trying to help Hannah is awesome. I need friends lik
Metal straws are dangerous. Especially blindfolded. 🤕
I love this duo...Ever since the Tin Can Challenge
i miss when nearly every youtuber did challenges like these awe
Favourite ice cream flavour is 1000% hazelnut
it's smoothie challenge again! but this time it's MILKSHAKE xD
Damn there are so many more flavors than I thought!! My favorite is the green tea!
Hi
My favourite flavour is Ttiger tiger
I love how tyler genuinely is trying to help hanna through the flavors! Like they are playing against eachother, but he is trying so hard to help her
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I miss these old style collabs!
This looked like fun!! (I meant the Tyler and Hannah hanging out but the smoothie making too)
Aawwww my faves !! I love you both so much !!❤😘
That blueberry crumble flavor looks AMAZING and I’m adding it to the grocery list ASAP cuz I desperately want to try it!
amazing, as always❤️
After watching this, I feel definitively that Hannah should wear bandanas more often.
damn   I really want a milkshake now...also this video was so fun and refreshing missed you guys hanging together!!
😍😍😍😍😍
Congrats to Hannah on her Ellen appearance! That was an exciting surprise.
My favorite ice cream flavor is cookies n cream since I'm a little oreo bitch. Glad to see the both of you collab again! I love you both!!
Favorite ice-cream flavor: Cookies & Cream
Go to flavor: Vanilla

Kiss, honey... (Keep It Simple Stupid)
I sometimes come to older YouTube channels to see how they're doing. People Like Eugina Cooney or Tyler Oakley
This collab makes my day! ( i was getting frustrated bcs of my homework) I rly needed this! Thank you
Yay I love a good ice cream. The more flavours the better. Fun challamge by the way and be quite tricky especially when both the flavours can be quite similar or becomes to masked from the other one. One must really have a sharp taste and knowledge of the exact name of the many sweety refreshing melt in your mouth goodness.
Salted caramel/sea salt caramel is my favourite ice cream ever. Also hi!!
Tyler said follow your heart when Hannah was guessing. You could say she should follow her hart...
Hi! This might sound kinda basic, but my fav flavor is mint chocolate chip for sure!
Hello you two beautiful queens!!! My favorite flavor of ice cream is Peach Melba (Peaches + Raspberry + Vanilla). It's SOOOOO GOOD!!!
Baskin Robbins Wild N Reckless
Hi 😍 my favorite flavor is cookies and cream
Now it make me want a milkshake, Tyler can you make me one 😁😍
Hi, and my fave flavor is Birthday Cake (with REAL cake crumbles).
The Rainbow Swirl is so nasty!!
Shouldn’t you be on the amazing race
Oh my god look at you two nerds you're all grown up ow my heart.
This feels like 2015 and I'm loving it! <3
Tyler love ur videos
finally the two most dead channels on YouTube made a collab
This reminds me of the old YouTube days 😍
VITIMIN C EVERYWHERE
This brings me so much joy, and I need to buy ice cream now.
I was so freaking excited watching this!
I’ve just started this and I’m honestly already in love, I missed you guys together! This is gonna be great I’m sure
All this did was make me hungry 😂
this dude is so irrelevant now, how sad. 😂
I guess 2016 Youtube is back? Would love to see Tyler collab with the OG YT collab gang & also the new wave  (Safiya Nygaard, Simply Nailogical, Joana Ceddia, The Try Guys etc)!!!
HI! Also Vanilla would have been hardest to guess
kinda disappointed that you didnt pick mint out of the bag,,, i would have loved to see your face
IVE MISSED MY FAVORITE GAYS
I love you both because no matter how successful you get, you keep your beautiful personalities. You still feel so authentic.
Hi, I love Hannah and Tyler colabs
Hi, I love Hannah and Tyler colabs
Hi, I love Hannah and Tyler colabs
tyler's "im drunk" at the beginning makes me cackle
Omfg the tin can challenge is still my fave video ever & I watch it all the time. This brought back memories 😆
OH MY GOOOOOOOO
I lost track of the both of you in the last like 2 years and damn it's good to be back
I was sitting eating Halo Top vanilla maple while watching. 😊
Tyler do they make a sugar free ice cream for diabetics? Love the Video. Just not as much as I love you Sis. 💖
3:37 when Queen Ty take off his glasses, like "Who the fudge is that?" HAHAHA
“Omg say hi” 😂😂
ok so I'm not an every vid follower of but I do watch enjoy and watch him with the holy trinity and follow him on other social medias but lately he has been hitting the gym or something cuz his arms are forever cut and where the phuck did his gorgeous cheeks go?! That's it. I don't normally comment on physical aspects but damn Tyler you almost don't look like Hannah any more.
Omggg I missed this duo ♥️
this was just a breath of fresh air
Hi Hannah! Hi Tyler!
HIIIIIYA! ☺️😂 And my favourite icecream is either hazelnut or lemon cheesecake. 😋
To be fair, oatmeal cookies and gingerbread actually have very similar recipes
Why are both of you so god damn gorgeous
Hey there :) my favorite of all ice creams is Ben & Jerry's Karmal Sutra.
ahhh the good old collab days of you tube. feels good to experience this again
I’m cheering for you to win surviver
Yaaaaay!!!!!! I was watching a bunch of your collabs today this is a gift from the gods
You two are adorable! ❤️❤️
Tyler did you win the amazing race with korey pls say yes 🤞
I thought your one guilty pleasure was Orange Chicken...
I thought your guilty pleasure was cool ranch Doritos???
Hiiiii....also I love Halo Top!
hi my fav flavor of all time is cookies n cream! love you Tyler and Hannah, I've watched you guys grow for 5ish years and you guys just make me really happy :)
Oh, hi. I'm a pretty vanilla kinda girl, but anything with peanut butter, too! Dairy free always.
yasssss !! 2 queens are back  <3 :D
I’m 110% sure I’m allergic to halo top cause it makes my throat hurt every time I eat it... but I still have the Mint Chip cause it’s my favorite! 😂
Hi! My favorite ice cream flavor is hazelnut! ☺
Instagram sent me:)
hi! my favorites are lemon cake and sea salt caramel :)
Hiiiiiii and my favorite ice cream is Cool Haus brand Dirty Mint Chip.
My two favorite people  with ice cream is all I ask for ❤️❤️
Hiiii!! My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate cookie crumble, Kroger brand
phish food is my favorite for sure! there is no comparison. i have it in my freezer right now
I LOVEEEE HALO TOPPPPP
RIP headphone users at @2:30 now I’m deaf 😵
can you confirm or deny that there seemed to be some tension in this video? Also, HI.
Lol I would love this game & also fail so hard 🤣 I think any flavor & Vanilla would be extremely hard to guess!
And Hannah Hart looks so fly in this video.
this just makes me really miss the golden years
DID SOMEBODY SAY BDSM!?!?
“stop sniffing so hard” 😂
the first video i watched of yours was the tin can challenge with hannah, i love you both SO much <3
I love Tyler and Hannah together
Tyler, I can't believe you're doing like the mystery milkshake challenge with Hannah Hart and I'm so happy for you!!!
Hi! I haven't watched something of yours in a few years, I think. You look healthy and happy and successful, so I'm glad to see you're doing well
omg this is so amazing
gasp Hannah!  We haven't see Tyler and Hannah collaborate in a while.  Whenever they get together, some funny and weird stuff happens... and I love it when it does.
Halo Top is a recent favorite of mine.  The sad news is that I recently found out I am lactose intolerant and have to be careful eating ice cream, which can go wrong even with lactase pills.  This is really sad because ice cream is my favorite treat.
12:15 😭👌🏽
I don't like sweets very much but I want that lemon cake in my face! Didn't know that was a thing.  And HELLLOOOO XO
Hi Tyler and Hannah! Have a great day ♥️
Hi! I love you both very much!
how did neither of them make gay jokes about the rainbow ice cream
i know that i would not have the same self-control
I don’t like the angle of the camera😭 miss the old set up
The two of you and mystery food=awesomeness.
Ilysm ur the best ur videos make me so happy 😍😍😍😍😍
Just watch your live and insta sent me love all your vids you are the absolute best
ALL THE HALO TOP THO SKSKSKSKS
RIP headphone users when they play the old clip and every time the blender runs
Hi! I need to try that Halo Top stuff.
OMG this is sort of a throwback to when you and Hannah did that hilarious but gross can challenge. And you had to drink the blended concoction XD That's one of my all time favorite collabs ever!
shout out to all my fellow Halo Bottoms out there
omg strawberry is amazinggggg
Hi I hope you guys had a good day and that my favorite ice cream flavor is cookies and cream 😝
most iconic yt duo!!
Love n miss this kind of content from youtube creators
Warning to viewers with sensitive stomachs: halo top is loaded with sugar alcohols. The first time you try it id be sparing with how much you eat. I had diarrhea for a whole day lmao
I've missed these two. Also this reminds me of the smoothie challenge but like tastier
I enjoy blueberry crumble, but not had the Halo version of it, will give it a try.
I love when yall collab. 💖
is it 2014/15-
I agree with everyone- it really feels like the good ole’ days of YouTube. It makes me feel like I’m back in 2013 still writing tumblr fan fiction and watching a wild mix of Kingsley, Tyler and Dan and Phil.
Hi. I loved that video it was so funny and just so nice to watch
Both stars of Ellen
Hi! Is there a coffee flavor? That's my favorite flavor of icream.
I haven't even finished this video and I love everything about it.
hello!
my favorite ice cream flavor is raspberry sorbet!
I haven’t been able to find the PB&J flavor anyyyyywhere. It’s my favorite ice cream/milkshake flavor.
I was wondering why you were posting tbt of your videos with hannah on twitter!
we need a shane dawson series on tyler oakley
Raspberry Ripple is at the Top!
MY FAV COLLAB TO WATCH YOU TWO R AMAZING
if i could choose an ice cream flavour:BUTTERSCOTCH.
What a GREAT DUO you guys are!!!!
This inspired me to make a milkshake and it was the best decision I’ve had today thank you
Y'all don't even look alike anymore. At least y'all used to dress alike. OHHH I miss the good ole days.
The question is how will this fit in your freezer 🤔
No disrespect I love you I just notice it’s not as great as it used to be sis
You and Korey need to do this!
oh my god 😂 i love you guys and  the challenge!
Hi! I love blueberry crumble too!
funny as i watch this she is on ellen. lol
I LOVE Giffords Smore's icecream, cookie dough and mint chocolate chip.
Good day Halo Top 🥇and Halo Bottom 🥈
omg i missed yall
My god, there's two of them!
Hi!!! My favourite flavour chocolate almond cruchhhh!!! Ugggggh so gooooodd

Old youtube. I miss 💔
Omg this is bringing me back to the tin can challenge 😭
Hi! Mint Chocolate chip is my fav!

2:30 RIP headphone users

The Dynamic Duo!!!!!!!!
I missed these vids
Hi Tyler My name Is Robin And My favorite Ice cream flavors Is Birthday Cake and Cookies and cream
he's stuck in 2014
amazing duo, good times
My favourites are chocolate and pistashio :)
I'm on headphones and the blander cause quite the chaos in my head.
hi! my favorite is strawberry sorbet ( sorry i'm French we don't have Halo :) )and the "blend" flavours must be hard to get! like yoghurt, oatmeal, cream...
Hi! My favourite ice cream is mint chocolate chip, or lavender gelato if I’m going fancy 😆
Being able to eat 30 different flavours of ice cream is my idea of a good time honestly
Yes I miss this Tyler
Love these two!!
My favorite ice cream flavor is definitely cookies and cream. Also, anything with chocolate I feel like would be impossible to guess.
I mean ok! Cool... but are you gonna get a dog?! Like, I’m waitiiiing!! ❤️
Hi! My fav is cookies and cream!
hi! Coffee!
11:02 is me at 3am
Now I desperately want halo top
Hi! Also I want/need to try that birthday cake one!!
The dislikes are all people who are lactose intolerant 😂
Peaches and cream 112😂
ice cream is my favourite thing, this is my dream
Coming for Joey Graceffa’s wig, I see
Hi, my favorite ice cream flavor is cappuccino it’s sooo good
Hey, I live in Mason, MI, which is a town over from Okemos. The crazy thing is that the Asian Buffet in Okemos is my absolute favorite restaurant. I love Chinese food and they have such a variety. I also saw a picture of you in there and was wondering if you also enjoy their food?
I love you two. So damn much.
hi, my favorite ice cream flavor is pistachio
34 thousand views? Its a shame his views have tanked so bad. I've met this guy 4 times, during 2 playlists and 2 vidcons. He is genuinely a kind, sincere and caring person. Its nauseating to see how many talentless tubers there are who clickbait and rely on their looks to draw huge views. YouTube is definitely not what it once was. Sad....
Hi! :) One of my favourite ice cream flavours is a specialty from a small ice cream parlour in my hometown: black liquorice - controversial, I know 😎
How long did it take you to film this? All I can think about is the continuous rinsing of the cups/blender between challenges. I’m too lazy for that 😂
so what does rainbow taste like??? confused brit here
Hi! My favourite ice-cream flavours are, Fig, Rum & Raisins and Stracciatella.
Yasssss queens
literally my two favorite people
I love this and i miss this
Okay this made me drive to the store and get ice cream, jeez, I need oatmeal cookie ice cream in my life, bring this shit to germany
Hi! This looked like fun.
Hi!!!!
This video was so fun!
You two are adorable
Hi! Or Hello!... how's your day?
I’d rather it be a tin can challenge v2 but this is cool.
Omg the old YouTube I love it
Y'all look like brother and sister and I can't tell who's who
when i went to moab there was this ice cream place that mixed the ice cream in front of you and then froze it with liquid nitrogen.  Lactose intolerance be damned, that stuff was delicious.  I got birthday cake!
Hi, blueberry crumble looks nice
collaboration with Shane Dawson!!!!
I loved this video!
Hi, Peanut butter... i follow directions some times...
hi i love this
oh a classic duo!!
“peppermint!” “stop that.”
Peaches and cream,  sweeter than sweet, chocolate cheeks and chocolate wings
MY FAV COLLAB PARTNERS !!!!
I loooove pistachio ice cream
I’m with you Hannah. I’m not much of an ice cream lover either. Like if you are the same way.
i lovee these types of videos!!!
Oooo the 2012 nostalgia 💕
Favorite video you’ve done in awhile.
Hi my favourite ice cream flavour is moose tracks
I would have watched them do this 100 times. Tyler and Hannah are the cutest! And ice cream...I mean, c’mon. Three gems!
1:37-1:40 so silly XD
cotton candy all the way
Why does this look green screened?
As soon as I have eaten all my oatmeal cookies she chooses oatmeal cookie
am i going mental?? why are there 2 tylers??
How?? Many?? Flavours?? Does?? Halo top?? Have?? no but seriously. In NZ they've just started coming into our stores and there's been maybe 8 flavours? a few were dairy free which is why I noticed them bc my lactose intolerant ass appreciates that. But seeing SO many in this video was unexpected. How much of their range over there is dairy free? I'm jealous anyway, even if they're not dairy free some of those flavours looked GOOD.
HI !!!!
Okay wow I thought Tyler stopped making videos like 5 years ago, but apparently I’ve just been unsubscribed
Is anyone else concerned with how much washing up was behind the scenes...
But is there actually gingerbread?!
this content is kinda 2014
Hi! Love y’all!
Hi 😘
Haaaaaaaaaaaaai!
i love this
My two favorite gays!
Where did she get that shirt I love it
Hi I love cookies and cream ice cream
All that halo top, you will spend the day pooping tomorrow
sad to look at falling views
Does halo top even make a gingerbread flavor?
Tyler Oakley
💛💛💛
This was so fun!
im late as always but honestly why did i miss the ice cream
I to am a huge ice cream lover after watching this video today I happened to find "halo top". With that being said so far I'm completely disappointed becasue pistachio doesnt taste  like pistachio at all! No wonder hannah couldn't guess that shit it's just extra salty and know pistachio NOT EVEN A HINT! The peanut butter cup one better redeem this brand.
Hi! And I’m all about the Dole whip :)
Hi :)
Wth happed to this channel
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
This can either be amazing....or gross...lets see lmao
Anyone slightly annoyed by the fact that they aren't blending it enough?
Hi! My favorite ice cream is Welsh Farms coffee royale. They used to have a factory near where I live that had a store front selling fresh made ice cream and is was to DIE for! I’ve tried Halo Top chocolate and cookies & cream. The chocolate was ok, but the cookies & cream left an aftertaste that I didn’t like.
Moose tracks
Oo I want to try that ice cream brand
Hi. Probably just a mint chocolate chip.
say hi
Lmao the BDSM comment
Did u take steroids??
Hey gurls!
Hi ❤️
whoa... tyler.. you lost weight
😂😂❤️❤️
Hi :)
Hiiiiiiiii , my favorite icecream which was not seen in the video would have to be oreo or reeses
Yaaaaaasssss
When did Tyler get hot
Hi ahhh this gave me the good old YouTube vibes it warmed my heart up after doing college work (ugh gross but almost done! (For my 1st out of now 5 years)) and my favorite flavor is orange sherbet from the ice cream parlor in my town. Although whits birthday cake could give it a run for its money if it wasn’t cream.
Hi lol
still the best gays in internetainment.
At least it’s more delicious than the tin can challenge
wow I really miss 2014/2015 youtube
MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP!!!!!!!
👋 hello! Ben & Jerry’s half baked is my favourite ice cream. 🍦
There is so much washing dishes in this video.
Dude still gets views???

HI. BLACK CHERRY THUNDER?

They could pass for twins.


And Tyler, you might want to stay out of the sun or get a facial or release some stress or something.
you're still youthful and sweet

Hi      Mint
Honestly, except for round 3, I think Hannah got the more difficult flavors
This gives me 2014 vibes and I'm living for it. Also my favorite flavor will forever be mint chocolate chip
I’m so happy that you’re pregnant! Congrats!
I’m still waiting for the next chicken nugget challenge!!!

I'm still waiting for Korey to look older.
Best of luck, you two.
I remember watching you guys on the amazing race, but having no idea who you were at the time, and now I'm like, woah
I was watching the first episode of the amazing race last night and when I saw Tyker and Korey on it I was litteraly freaking out.
I'VE MISSED KOREY!!!!
IM SO FIGGIN HAPPPYYYY
im from colombia and i feel like a proud mother.
I saw you on my local news this morning and freaked out!!
my mom and sister were watching the episode and i came downstairs and I was just like,
i s    t h a t . . . .
I still think Korey is Ki-ute. It is simply those eyes.
Omg imagine the jet lag😱
He has a BIG announcement 😏😏
Woah!!!!
I love you, Tyler!!!
I love the amazing race and specifically tuned in for you two and my favorites Leo and Jamal. The previous time you raced Tyler giggled the whole time which was fun to watch.  Two episodes so far and no giggles.  Your giggles is infectious, and makes everyone laugh.  I hope you'll consider bringing it back.
Omg you're literally irrelevant
im watch amazing race and when i saw you guys i flipped out and my grandmother said she was going to shut the tv off if i didn't shut up
Chicken nugget challenge!!!!!!
I'm so excited!!! I stopped the video to set the timer on my tv :D
Tyler is so small 😂
The only reason I have now checked out your channel is because of your guys intro on The Amazing Race
is this about that thing you tweeted about last year lmao
OMG YES
Are they dating ?
THE AMAZING RACE WAS IN 2015?????? WHAT


Also, just checkin: have you already announced this on Twitter or did I dream the future some time ago??
Tyler your plants look great!!
I SAW YOU ON AMAZING RACE 😁😁😁
Wow I feel like I just got flashed to the past... wow can’t believe it’s been so long! I remember watching every episode with my mom and the whole time I would just scream at the tv like “LETS GO TYLER AND KOREY!” And i was also a part of the live twitter chat for the final episode!! Wow can’t believe how fast time flies!!
Who else is here because they saw the amazing race?!

How can you as such a huge supporter of LGBTQ  rights actually support Cochella? To know you could actually give money to a guy that gives so much money to anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion, pro-gun bigot is so wrong lost so much respect.

Any fellow psychobabies?
YYYYAAAAAASSSSSSSS!!!!!!!

Where my Little Monsters @? ⚡️
Only one thing that accurately summarizes both Tyler and Gaga
this honestly feels like my SAT's
haha me being dramatic
This queen out here taking about a queen
Lady Gaga is and always will be one of my favorites ❤️❤️
I love Gaga but my memory sucks😂
Favorite single: Bad Romance 
Shoulda been a single: Gypsy
Tyler, thank you for being you. Also, anyone who’s reading this, thank you for being you. Don’t think that’s been said enough. Love you
im so uneducated on gaga songs tbh this was impressive
LADY GAGA IS MY QUEEN !!!!! 👑👑👑👑
BRB going to take the test now
Okay so I be dyslexic but I got 36!!
THE TRUEST GAGA STAN😍😍
LITTLE MONSTER FOREVER 🙌🔥👑
This is great
My favorite single is a promotional single "Hair" and "MANiCURED should've been a single period.
I got 35!! I feel very disappointed by myself. My fave Gaga single is prooobably You and I, and my favourite song that shoulda been a damn single is either Electric Chapel, or SchieBe. (I just really love Born This Way, i guess)
I can’t believe I got here this early
Favorite single: You and I 
Favorite song that should have been a single: Gypsy
I'm so fricken bad at these when I do them everything drops from my memory
I'm a moster. Why was i so depressed and this just cheers me up tyler?
Honestly you are like that kinda person that gives good vibes 😂
God I love Gaga so so much!!
Fav song of all time- Speechless 
Fav song that should’ve been a single - A YO
Favorite single: Applause
The Song that should have been an album: Government hooker (or hair)
Best Album: Born this way (Fame monster is a very close second)
The quiz messed me up because they didn’t include some ASIB and C2C tracks
Love you xx
Do you like and listen to panic! At the disco???
I GOT 32!! Awww I was also nervous and typos were everywhere!!!
let me think...my fav is the artpop album! 
dance in the dark and edge of glory should have been singlesssss
So Happy I Could Die, Heavy Metal Lover, Venus and Diamond Heart ❤️
Favourite single: You and I
Shoulda been a single: Scheiße
Thanks for uploading queen xx
i took the quiz twice and i got 35 both times. my keyboard skills r trash.
my favorite lady gaga's single is Alejandro
and my favorite b side is heavy metal lover (iconic performance at the btw ball)
I'm gunna try this, telephone and ayo are my favourites!
I got 31  🤷🏻‍♂️. Starstruck is forever ICONIC
I kept freezing up lmao
Scheiße should've been a single tbh
"She's my number one..."
Me: BA Ba ba ba ba ba baba bu ba ba bubu ba ba WE ARE NUMBER ONE
Favourite Single: Poker Face or The Edge of Glory

Favourite other song: Diamond Heart, but there’s honestly so many to choose from
Hey! Got here from the livestream <3
Tyler, that was so impressive! You’re amazing!
Favorite Singles:
There’s no way I can pick only one. These are my top favorites
You & I
G.U.Y.
Alejandro
Judas
Bad Romance
Poker Face 
Paparazzi
Born This Way
Omg I love LADY GAGA so much she is so great.!
I only got 32... I'm a little disappointed
Favorite single: Applause or Marry The Night (too hard to choose)
Should've been a single: DEFINITELY VENUS (and no, a promotional single doesn't count)
... I completely forgot about Monster :/ 

Even though it used to be my favourite song. I would've liked to see it as a Fame Monster single.
I LOVED how they did it in the tour. That jump they do when the song swells back up is iconic to me.
Thanks for this inspiring video!
Gaga is a Legend 👑♥️
I got 43 which is fine but i know i can do alot better
18 out of 79... I let mama monster down  😭😭😭

But I feel like my favorite single will always be “poker face” but the song that I feel should’ve have been a single but wasn’t was “monster”... monster was just overall an amazing song
TELEPHONE... wait VIDEO PHONE?

Also me lol
I LOVE Monster! That’s my number one choice for should have been a single. 

Favorite single is probably Bad Romance. That song is epic and also how I discovered Lady Gaga.
I got 15 songs!! Omg!! 🤬☹️ that under pressure time kills me!!!
Favorite single: Judas
Song that should be a single: Swine, Venus, Donatella, Artpop (I just really loved the Artpop album okay?)


I only got 23 on the test but only because I freeze up on tests T_T
Fav single: Judas
Should have been a single: Dance in the Dark
You did really good lmao
A QUEEN is talking about a QUEEN!
Yoo Tyler has been pumping some iron 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I’ve been watching you foreverrrrr and your still my fave YouTuber. Keep up the good work boooo😁
I got 33 :D You did so well! Electric chapel should've been a single! My favourite song right now is perfect illusion (the instrumental version is HEAVEN)
Hi Tyler your are amazing I love you so much
Paparazzi And Dance In The Dark
I love amr diab 🤷🏻‍♂️
I may know the songs but girl do I suck at typing fast and correctly, the highlight of my test was typing "hehe" instead of "eh eh"  🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Hey I just watched the live! Love you sm please reply to me ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love you
Queen Tyler's always going to be the number one diva though! 💋❤️
How you gonna forget Bloody Mary like that, Tyler!!
Good video Tyler. Just wanted to say that you are such a pure and beautiful soul. God Bless. Love from Canada.
I was not prepared for the gun show when I clicked onto this video... 💪🏻💪🏻 damn Tyler you jacked!
I got 30 but also could have got more if I could spell lmao


My favourite Gaga song is Hair
The disrespect to Angel Down is sacrilegious
I miss your content I feel like I haven’t watched you in forever show your beautiful face more
Glamour Zombie definitely should be a single
Once I saw this I knew I had to do it! I filmed it and just uploaded 😊 I love Gaga so much, thanks for sharing this!
We love a lady Gaga stan❤️❤️❤️
How dare you bring up Bad Kids booklet version. RIP </3
I would only have gotten the singles. Im not a mega fan, but she is still AMAZING
Man u come back to the amazing race. I'm happy to see you.😀😁
56/79 😨

Favourite single: Dance in the Dark (if you count it); otherwise, MTN/Judas
Song that should've been a single: Heavy Metal Lover
Fav Gaga Single: Born this Way or Paparazzi
Should have been a single: Hey Girl ft Florence or Gypsy
I got 27 but I think I messed up and started the timer before I started typing lol, Venus should have been a single off artpop
😂Tyler is such a fan girl I love him so much
I got 66 😅🎉
I love Edge of Glory and Gypsy!
Just wanted to say I came from the live in Instagram and that you are inspiration of resilience and bravery and as of recently fitness! Love you tons and your content!
ARMMSSSSS
Didn't realize I was still subbed....yEET
My brother has met his match -
Well done Tyler ! I only had like 15 good answers. ^^ I don't know if it's a good choice but I'm still a super fan of Telephone which is iconic to me in so many ways. But I agree with you Swine should have been a single, I love its energy and anger !
I did the test before I saw the video and I forgot 5 obvious songs )): I got nervous haha
A friend got me into this whole Lady Gaga madness and I love him for it. My very first song, which I listened to was Bloody Marry, and I still really like it. But to pick a single song is impossible for me... I love them all. 
The same goes to eras. There is not a single era, which I prefere, in every era there is something what I really love. 
I can't really consider myself a big fan but i really like her not just for her music but for her personality too. She is amazing. 💞
"...that's like an inbetween-gle" lmao LOVE YOU TYLER
i can relate to "hair" and "born this way". yes i'm polyamorous.
Speechless should’ve been a single in a damn minute. It’s a masterpiece imo
Hey Tyler. Love u so much. This video is amazing. You are the best person ever Tyler. ❤❤❤❤
- 24 out of 79 (typing on a phone is not that convenient haha.) 
- Should have been a single: Donatella, Swine, Monster, Heavy Metal Lover, Bad Kids, Summer Boy and Bloody Mary (I can't just pick one, there are so many good ones!) 
- My favorite Gaga song: (SOOOOOOO THOUGH! 😭) We are going to do one per album henny: Paparazzi, Alejandro, Bloody Mary, Donatella and Perfect Illusion.

LOVE YOU TYLER! 😘🇲🇽
I got 25, and I am ashamed. Revoke my gay card.

Favorite single is easily “Bad Romance,” but “Monster” should have been a follow up to that. I’ll never forgive her.
I got 45! I feel like I could do better if I stuck with each album though
I got eight but typing is not my strength and the typos killed me,😑😫
Speechless is underrated and amazing
UGH so mad at myself I only got 25
31... literally took me 10 seconds spelling million reasons
It’s not the S-A-T, it’s not the A-C-T, it’s the…


GAY-C-T 🌈
I panicked and only got 29. I'm disappointed in myself...lol
this video has been the highlight of my day
I love all the singers but Gaga is also my favorite
honestly i appreciate Gaga so much 🙌🏼 but you are awesome and i hope i have amazing supporters just like you too x
Hey Tyler! I came from Instagram @SamiWOW17 I love your videos and beautiful you, one of my most favorite songs from lady Gaga is marry the night!
When Tyler made threw shade at people who are like "wait lady gaga has more songs than bad romance" i felt so seen 😂
Favorite Single has to be Marry The Night 
Favorite Song is definitely Bloody Mary
Judas is my favourite song and Monster should've been a single!
I'm kinda sad when I typed Second Time Around but the quiz told me I'm wrong ...
(PS.  look at my username)
Too much pressure lol I only got 14... but they didn't accept Grigio Girls or Heal Me for some reason
I just bought Binge, it's so heavy, i'm excited to read it ;)
Favorite Single: uhh, probably Applause or Marry The Night. 
Should have been a single: SEXXX DREAMS, DUUUHH. And Heavy Metal Lover.
Should have happened: Artpop Vol. 2!!!!!!!!
That's is azmazing Video <3 i LOVE IT
I did it, wrote Heal Me, I want Your love and Brooklyn nights and it said that it wasn't correct...
Lady Gaga might be your queen, but YOU are MY queen 😂❤️🙌🏼
monster is my favourite song of all time it’s so underrated also i got 50/79
my memory is so bad. I would fail so much:D
did you just never take a typing class in middle school-
Are we all just going to ignore how bulky Tyler has become?
I love ❤️ Lady Gaga. Bad Romance, Bloody Mary, Guy and the shallow. Best songs I like.
Tyler if you dont heart this I'll be so sad
Hi Tyler!  I've been watching for years & following along with your love of Gaga.  Thank you for everything you do!
I only got 23, major disappointment in myself... lolol
This is the content I am HERE for
I love GaGa and you so much so this video made me so happy
Love you forever❤️👏
my fave talking about my QUEEN <3
Bloody Mary should have been a single !!!
I GOT PRESSURED AND ONLY GOT 20! #ForShame
favorite single: born this way
fav song that should be a single: scheiße
Lady gaga bit@hhhhh 101 . Born This Way , Telephone , love game , Bad Romance , You&i , Poker Face , and moreeee her songs is f**king amazing cheeseballs
Hey Tyler! Was just watching your live but could you react to Jon Bellion? I love his music and his new album has really pulled me out of a dark place same with your videos  if love to hear your opinion on him and the acoustic versions are AMAZING ❤️❤️❤️ Love you
I took the test before you and all I could come up with was bad romance and born this way
I got 11😶 I love Gaga so much though. But like i don't remember anything. I even forget my friends names😂
iM ON YOUR LIVE I LOVE YOU ❤
I did this quiz a few days ago (I did ok) and I thought of you Tyler!
The quiz didn't even accept every song
I got 10 out of 79 so you did way better and I was cheering you on the whole time!!
My favorite thing about Tyler’s videos is that they’re such good entertaining content without being 45 minutes long like most youtubers
Okay, I got 15 out of 23 but for the singles, The quiz is fault; 3 were not official singles so it’s more like 15 out of 20 😅
prove your lady gaga fandom by doing hq's gaga trivia tomorrow
TYLERRRRRRRRR 
look at those muscles 👀👀👀👀👀
Not a super fan of Gaga but I love her dearly. Came from your ig livestream to give you some love hope you have a good day!
I got 40 my first try and every single time I took it after, I got a lower number. LOL
i love you so much💕
You would’ve had to be a speedy typer and perfect speller to get more than 80% of the songs, so good job Tyler! 
Dance in the Dark would have been an awesome single and it was supposed to be one but wasn’t because of a dispute between Lady Gaga and her record company
You would’ve had to be a speedy typer and perfect speller to get more than 80% of the songs, so good job Tyler! 
Dance in the Dark would have been an awesome single and it was supposed to be one but wasn’t because of a dispute between Lady Gaga and her record company
Those guns Tyler 🤤
Tyler- best Gaga video in your opinion?
Swine has so much potential oh well  missed opportunity
A Gaga x Tyler collab possibly? :)
it also helps if you include unreleased tracks like Nothing On But The Radio, Blueberry Kisses, Earthquake (Then You'd Love Me), Honest Eyes, Ribbons,  Reloaded, Second Time Around, Red And Blue, No Way, Let Love Down,  Oh Well, there's a lot more i forgot
I never hit on faster than this a YouTube notification... I like it before loading
I got only 25 answers right :(
yes beeeeeeetch!!! fave song is dance in the dark and no way 100% should have been a single or at least on an album
I am sooo not a superfan, I only got 19 songs! But I agree, Monster should have been a single (and I'm shocked you forgot it Tyler!)
i got 42, i have the WORST TYPING💀
My favorite single is applause, because I love the cover art. My favorite non single that should’ve been one is  ARTPOP.
Can't type fast enough to take on that challenge! I like a lot of her music though!✌❤
Songs that should be singles: Almost everything from Artpop and The Fame Monster Deluxe. But here are the top picks:
JOHN WAYNE! (Top Pick) And GUY should have been played on radio stations, that really hurt! 
HAIR
SEXXX DREAMS 
DOPE
FASHION
GYPSY
COME TO MAMA
Venus 
Swine 
Aura
Diamond Heart
Angel Down
Grigio Girls
Omg I would love to try this quizz I feel like I would be pretty good
I only got 35 because I kept having typos and my autocorrect put the weirdest stuff. It would be easier to just name them verbally 😂
I can not believe I forgot about Hair that was my jam brb gonna download the whole discography
I got 31. Idk I kinda froze up while trying to remember, even tho I've listened to and love a huge majority of her songs. <3
I got 5! I wonder in what percentile I am...
I love Tyler Oakley as much as he love lady Gaga
I was watching along and kept screaming “MILLION REASONS! MILLION REASONS!”
Fav single - Judas
Song that should've been a single - Electric Chapel
I got a 60! I’m pretty freakin proud of that!!
omg i only got 35 cus my brain is old and slow but we love her. we are just getting old maybe
My mom used to play Lady Gaga all the time,  practically grew up with her
Don’t think I could type fast enough to get all of them even if I knew them all.
I only got 17 and it was endlessly upsetting. So Happy I Could Die and Summerboy are great.
Tyler, I know that Lady Gaga is one of my favorites and she's the Mother Monster!!!
That's 50%!!! Not good...lmao
this channel is rly dead
Tyler and lady Gaga aka my parents 💕💕
favorite single is definitely you and i and gypsy was robbed of being a single and i’m still upset about it
I gagarolled this week and after seeing this, this makes me realized Im still not Gaga-enough tho~ but this inspired me to listen to more of her music and explore her pop culture 😊
The "legends stanning legends" comment has never been more appropriate!
I thought I was a MONSTER FAN BUT AFTER WATCHING TYLER 😱😱
- applause 
- bad romance
- just dance 
- John Wayne
- telephone 
- Born this way 
- shallow 
That’s all I got 
 😟😱
Girl I’m in LOVE with Bang Bang and the one that should’ve been a single is definitely Monster.
haaha, oh my god i got 27 🙈 The brain just freezes.
I got 39!! You're great
Hey love your vids 💜
The Fame shoulda been a single
But, I can’t pause and take the test cause I wanna watch the video Tyler!
Listed to Artpop and Joanne immediately after watching this 😂
imagine trying to do a fall out boy version of this
it would literally take the entire time to type one song title
Dance in the Dark is an underrated Gaga song
He spent most of the time trying to spell things 😂
Favourite Single? I think it'd have to be Judas (was that a single? She did a music video, tbh idk)
Favourite non-single that should've been? Monster, you said it, it's probably my all-time favourite gaga song

I also only got like 30 because I can't remember them under pressure hahahahaha
1:07  
Me when I'm faced with the slightest challenge
Manicure should've been a single! Also the demo track version of Aura is SO much better, AND IT COULD'VE KILLED AS A SINGLE.
Loved gaga in that film that I can’t remember rn 😂😂
You’re honestly so amazing I love you❤️
Love Tyler Oakley like he loves Gaga
UMMMM TYLER MISSED HIGHWAY UNICORN I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD REVOKE HIS GAY CARD NOW (kidding I LUV U SIS)
This video stressed me out 😂😂😂
Two of my faves- Tyler and Gaga 😍😍😍😍
Summerboy should have been a single period.
Herw before 100k
I love me some Gaga, but I only got 15 :(
Aww Boys Boys Boys is also my favorite from The Fame. And Dance In The Dark SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE! Ugh only thinking of how iconic the music video would've been makes me wanna cry all the time.
Crap, got 18 but only started to listen to her super heavily about 2 months ago.
Shout my YouTube out it’s Tobiah Garcia
I did ~so~ bad but my roommate is talking to her mom on the phone and distracted me
AYO
favourite single: bad romance
favourite song that should have been a single: scheibe
I got 17 🤣
Was he shading Angle Down............ work tape <3
Anyone’s favorite is Applause, like me
How do you keep getting sexier with age?!
Is this the second Lady Gaga Queens Addition?
Get drunk with TANA
The Gaga stan we all aspire to be 👏🏻
Hi tyler, we love u
PAPER GANGSTA SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE!!!!!!
I love how big of a fan u are! I love her music but I'm no where a big fan like you are.
Proud of you! 💖
I blanked so hard and only got 19. lol
Only 23. I keep singing the whole song instead of moving on
I was a huge fan of you back in 2012-2015 then I kinda stopped watching a lot of youtubers and I decided to check you out again a couple months ago and have been watching ever since. It’s great to see you just filming what makes you happy and just enjoying your work and it shows, instead of trying to cater to the trends. Everyone hits a high on youtube and FEW people can maintain that for years, and few can hold a solid dedicated fan fanbase and it seems you have done that. Also, I LIVE for the podcast, you and Korey are hilarious and it’s the highlight of my week, I can’t wait to watch you guys on amazing race! 😘
Hair should have been way bigger
Hey ILYSM PLEASE REPLY TO MY COMMENT, HOPE YOU'RE HAVING AND AMAZING DAYYY 💕❤💟💕💟💕💗💗💗💗💗❤❤💕
They didn't let me put Hair Body Face - truly underrated
academy award winner lady gaga, the best
I got 20 - my brain went blank 😅
Omg i love you soooo much. You're my idol.  Xx ❤❤
Only 43, but Monster should have been a bigger dance hit.
I got 30 since I did it on my phone. Favorite single is Bad Romance because that song heightened my obsession of Gaga. What should’ve been a single was Monster because that could’ve been a Halloween anthem that everyone could’ve fallen in love with!
i got 51
i did this and got legit 48 because i couldn't spell any of the other ones
i remember when i saw gaga before she was famous and then after she was famous when her 2nd album came out <3
YOU ARE BOTH MY QUEENS 💕
Hi I love you so much I have pretty much seen every video you have ever made btw I love laby gaga
Holy shit...Remember when Tyler Oakley was POPPIN...these views tho what happened
Donatella should've been a single period
Love ittttttt ❤
For one of my dances in my dance recital we are doing a dance to a bunch of Lady Gaga songs mixed together
i got 41 I COULD BE BETTER
1 view
💛💛💛
So I took it twice..and got 30 both times! And I learnt that typing is hard. Favourite song I can’t really answer as it depends on my mood but top 5 are Manicure, Bad Romance, Speechless, You & I, John Wayne
Your arms look amazing 😩😍
Omg Lady Gaga needs to do this
The Poopie List
I only got 16 since I got stressed
They forgot Edge of Glory 😭😭😭
i live for the queen, i have a Little Monster tattoo in cursive. i love it and her soso much
J U D A S
Yaassss Gaga..... lmao the amount Lady Gaga albums I own is like wowwwww.
I wasted so much time trying to spell Scheibe 😂😂
LOVE THE SHIRT TY!
I'm a bad gay. I only got ELEVEN. x___x
Your laptop bouncing around as you typed stressed me out more than the timer counting down guuuuuurlllllll pop it on the coffee table
I got 44 too!!
Bloody Mary is one of my faves from Born This Way
Why was I stressed and screaming at my screen like I was watching a Dora the explorer episode ?
Not to brag or anything... but i got 7!...
Bloody Mary should have been a single. I want to say Hey Girl should be a single because I Stan Florence Welch, But...y’all heard the track...Gypsy would have been nice as a single. Also I’m trash and I love Summerboy,, but like the fame has enough hits.
Love this so much
I got 23 lmao
I’ve known you were a monster for ages
i love u so much
i love u so much
Fave single Applause and what should've been a single so happy I could die and my fave non single Dance In The Dark
I’m gonna take this quiz ASAP tbh, anyone else?
The cure is the best
HI FIRST COMMENT
I got 53
ILYYY
Wow I didn’t know this was still here
How could you forget ‘do what you want’? Gaga and Xtina singing together is simply perfection.
Marry the night is one of my favorites and I forgot it. HOW CAN I LIVE WITH MYSELF?
I am honestly impressed. I did the Taylor Swift one and it's like once the three minutes started my mind blanked out and I didn't do well!
beat me by ONE
I got 37 damn I shoulda practiced typing. Anyways, justice for Gypsy.
I got 75! :)
got 47 👌🏼Favourite single is The Edge of Glory, Favourite song that should have been a single (so many!!) but either Scheiße of Heavy Metal Lover (Or Gypsy, John Wayne, Sexxx Dreams.... I could go on forever!) 😩😂
Gypsy should have been a single
My favorite single is Born This Way because of the meaning and impact, and song that should have been a single is definitely Scheiße because it's a banger
36 out of 79
@troyaccola think u can top this
Venus should have been a single!
Was just at the live:)
Hmm, I think my fav single would be GUY and my fav song that should’ve been a single would be either Bloody Mary, So Happy I Could Die, Americano, Teeth or Dancin’ in Circles... Probably Bloody Mary out of all those but had to list them all... I don’t think I would fare well with the test. I’m a Britney fan who likes Gaga a lot, but for example I couldn’t mention all the songs off the Fame, haven’t listened to Cheek to Cheek or even the soundtrack for A Star is Born yet haha, so yeah... If it were a Britney test I would ace it 💪🏼
Gaga is the best
Wow👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
favorite single: gotta say paparazzi???? I think that’s a single......... and song that SHOULD have been a single: GYPSY!!
Ur my dad 😁
I got 49
An in-betweengle
So happy I could die is one of my all time favourites the beat is just soooo good!
OMG you did so good I couldn’t have named half of those😂
I love you😭💕
I got 63!!!
I don’t know any thing compared to you
i feel like i wouldn't have done well on any artist i love lol i just have a bad memory for song names...
33 and I love Brown Eyes!
You are my queeeeen
hahah I love this!:) your hilarious
Who knew ur still alive
Loving loving this
my long term memory is shit but i got 23
I'm sorry Tyler I listen to your podcast but could only name two songs off the top of my head.... 😅😅😅
I feel like your arms will take over the world at some point
16 out of 79
Just watched your live
SO EXCITED FOR #LG6
the jewels n drugs tea
Hi please reply
Hey Tyler I love u so much I’m in Great Yarmouth right now for holiday u should come and visit here it’s in the uk it’s fun love u xx u are my idol xx
gaga's not my fave but if there was a taylor swift or twenty one pilots version i'd ace it
gaga is the queen of everything
Lmao youre obviously a born this way album stan. Yaaaasss my fave album
Yas gurl! When you said Jewels and drugs is the worst lady gaga song, I felt it😅
Tyler’s arms wow ok i see you
Where is my twitter DM?
this made ma anxious like it’s way too much pressure i saw there was a taylor swift one and i was like no i can’t do it, i will forget everything because of the PRESSURE
Cheek to Cheek and ASIB are the harder ones.
wrong timing!!! am a slow typer today because of this lady gaga-ish nail extensions and its my first time in gel nail extensions..
The Cure reminds me of my bestie. “And if you say you’re ok, I’m gonna heal you anyway”. Should have been a huge hit on the radio.
i got 45!!! i’ll take it
Excuse you Angel Down is fantastic, it's one of my go to cry songs
I got 15 I feel ashamed lol
girl, i really flopped. i only got 12 which is horrible considering i know a fair amount of her old stuff, but i stopped computing in those three minutes
WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY
I got 39 out of 79, I was STRESSED
I got 48!
Not to brag but I got 56.
As someone who has memorised every word to her discography I’m embarrassed to admit I only scored 21!!! Every song left my head the second I pressed start, I caved under the pressure
Can you shout my YouTube out it’s Tobiah Garcia
I only got 18 out of 79, but I don't do well under time constraints. Going by album is a good strategy. Picking a favorite Lady Gaga song is really hard, but "Eh, Eh Nothing Else I Can Say" should have been a single.
Songs that should have been singles: "Boys Boys Boys", "Monster", "Dance in the Dark" was a single in select countries and should have got a wide release, "Scheisse", "Black Jesus Amen Fashion", "Sexxx Dreams", "Swine", "Aura", "Brooklyn Nights", "Nothing On (But the Radio)", "John Wayne", "Diamond Heart", "Heal Me". PERIODT!
I want to see her take this test hahaha
I got 13 😕 I got stuck trying to write the right names for edge of glory (The edge of glory apparently) and til it happens to you (to l’s apparently...) lesson learnt: need to learn to spell!
We love Gaga! Also, was just watching your live. Also, it’s Haidens birthday! GO SHOW HER SOME LOVE
This is the most Tyler video I’ve ever seen
Favorite Gaga single will always be Poker Face. Favorite Gaga songs that should’ve been a single are Dance in the Dark, Summerboy,Government Hooker, and Gypsy.
I got 45!! My favourite single is Judas for sure, its always a bop and then should’ve been a single would have to beeee... THERES TOO MANY, but probably speechless or come to mama or GUY or maybe heavy metal lover i just cant decide how could you ask such a question 😂
I love Hair and You & I
I want this but with ed sheeran songs lol
I only got 27😭guess I’m not good under pressure
Wow you're actually bad at this sksk
I love him
I forgot that she originally sings Marry The Night 😂 I’m so used to Adam Lambert singing it on glee
I forget literally all of everything when I do these. But I got 30, and I felt like that isn’t terrible. But I forgot a whole bunch
Oh so red and blue is not counted lmao steffani germanotta is shaking
holy shit when did you get so swole
You forgot monster i-
Little monsters!!!  Love the little monster fanbase.
My favorite Lady Gaga song is Poker Face. I think Applause should have been a single.
iloveypu tyler
Favorite single has to be bad romance, because of memories, but now I would say Perfect Illusion.  Song that should have been a single, Judas
First comment
Serious question, is this guy gay? this is an actual question
my favourite gaga single is Applause.... And the song that i literally wonder to this day why wasn't it a single is VENUS.. WHY THE HELL WASN'T IT A SINGLE????? and  maybe speechless too should've been a single, like come on?!?!?!
I got 30 out of 79
I want to do this with my own fave musician
The Trash N Drugs shade
I got 33! yay!!! I love Lady Gaga!!!
i love this!!!!😍😍😍😍
What a queen
Love gaga
Wasn't Princess Die a single? Or like is that to old for this quiz?

GAGA GAGA GAGA GAGA GAGA

❤️❤️❤️
Oof channel died
Scheiße should’ve been a single. PERIODT!
Fav is Marry the NighT & SEXXX dreams should have been a single
Bad Kids, Hair, So Happy I Could Die, Speechless, Scheibe
I only got 23 and I’m disappointed in myself
oh a BuzzFeed quiz? Sounds like a fun time!
Hey, Tyler it would mean the world to me if you could next come to my university Hollins I would die! Could you possibly? Also love the Video!
Why was this so entertaining i dont even stan gaga
YAAAAS SIS
It isn’t even a comprehensive list. Where’s Grigio Girls? And Just Another Day? Someone at buzzfeed is getting fired
Yaaaas
HAIR
Gaga is everythingggg bitchhhh

Venus and scheibe should've be singles!
Another failed youtube channel thats sad
Look me in the eyes and tell me come to mama shouldn’t have been a number 1 hit single

That should be a meme on crack videos 😂 biiiiiiiiiiiiittttcccccchhhhh 😂😂😂😂😂
these videos are always so weird to watch and make me question my life. I remember dan and phil did one and I made the mistake of playing it without headphones...my roommate had QUESTIONS
I am literally frustrated watching you play this. No way I could play this without throwing my phone!
this is going to be demonetized quicker than Netflix cancelling ODAAT
Omg your screams are hilarious! You are on loudspeaker and my dog is going crazy 🤣
tyler not to be loud or anything but like. you should get a dog.
Omg its been a minute since I watched a video, but your looking good!

I don’t even need to watch this video to know that I’m gonna die laughing. 


But I’m still gonna watch it...
My weekend was just me watching season 11 of Doctor Who and discovering that I am VERY gay for Thirteen. To each their own.
this game should be called “how to ruin ur vocal cords 101”
Who else would love to see Patti LuPone and Kristin Chenoweth make the character jump right out of the phone?
Thank you for giving me this trick I was scared I was going to wake up my  neighbor in the apartment next to me with all my screaming 😂
Omg I can't believe they renamed yasuhati, that's what this game used to be called bc I remember when dan and phil played it on the gaming channel
This game is HILARIOUS!! 🤣
Was watching ETN Tyler Oakley funny moments, but this was more important to watch! 😋😋💎💎
My cat and I are quite intrigued by the sounds you are making. 😂
hello hello HELLO hello...see okay ZSZSXZSZZ hm kay. 😂😂😂😂
You should do a video playing ROBLOX
7.5 million subscription but only 16k views your YouTube channel is dead bro ..
Harry Potter Mystery is my favorite game right now!!! Also any coloring app, super calming :)
Omg Tyler’s background isn’t orange chicken anymore 😭
Tyler please dm me on Twitter! It's Amber_Dawson55!

The two games I play is PokemonGo and a game called Lovenikki which may or may not be controlling my life right now
I watched this when it came out earlier but you said you’re replying on twitter so heyyyy
Tyler you looked so stunning in that white mesh top!
Can we please have an episode of Psychobabble that's just you playing this game?? Haha!!

It’s so stressful to watch someone else play a game badly even though I would probably do so much worse
Disney emoji blitz
Jesus you have fallen off
Hey Tyler, I know it’s probably a no bc you’re a busy person lol, but I’d like to invite you to my 16th birthday next month in New Jersey, I’m @baileyshews on twitter if ya want to know more lol, love you boi💕

Tell you what I do know,  you looked ripped af at 30.  Congrats.  Happy Birthday! ❤️🌈
Happy Birthday! I'm 34 and I still don't know how to properly fold a fitted bedsheet, and I probably never will!
This is actually the cutest video ever. Happy birthday! 💓🖤
I am 31 and i still don't know ... How to time things so that all the 'elements' of the meal that i am making, finish cooking at the same time. :)
I'm turning 29 in August and I still don't know how to keep plants alive either
the editing is amazing c:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIS! Literally still look 25. I've been watching you forever and still here. I'm 21 and I still don't know if I want to continue talking about Transformers on YouTube after 8 years, or start making videos like yours. Love your stuff. Stay fabulous. :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!!!!!!!!!!!! im almost 21, i still dont know a lot, but what I do know is that you made it so much easier to come out to my family, when i was scared.
I’m 20, and I don't know how to ride a bike 🚴
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! i can’t believe you’re 30, i’ve been watching you since 2013 which is insane 💘✨
Happy birthday. 23 and still don't know how to not be a nervous reck/ socially weird in front of people I admire or hope to be my mentor in life

Aww this was cool👍😊
Happy 30th birthday Tyler❤🎉🎉

Happy birthday tyler . You are the sweetest and awesome human being ever.
Tyler, I just turned 33 last week and I don’t know how to do pretty much most of the things you mentioned in your video so I guess we are in good company. I struggle the most with parallel parking, well any car stuff really...
The planning and effort put into editing this is crazy, it turned out so good. Happy Birthday<33
if i made a list of things I don't know it would be a lifelong livestream (loved the video though!)

Happy Birthday Tyler, it's almost hard to believe that you are turning 30 today, the days just go by so fast, and I hope you have a good one! 🎂😁👍

Happy 30th Birthday.  I am 48 and still don't know how to do Algebra.  I took it and passed but that was only because I went in and got help from the teacher.  Algebra II was a pity pass I am sure of it.  I wonder if it was because I brought him, cookies and other yummy treats I made in home economics.
I LOVE YOU TYLER 💖
Ok, this was really cute

I turn 29 in September....and I still don't know how to do the splits.....or fold a fitted sheet right...anyways....HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!!!! 🎊🎉🎈🎁🎂

I'm 22 and I still don't know how to make a good conversation
Wow, I can’t believe you are 30. I’m 25 and used to watch your videos a lot when I was a teenager. I don’t watch much anymore, but your videos helped me a lot when I was a lonely teen. Happy birthday Tyler!
happy birthday Ty
been 29 for almost 3weeks and still ain't got my life together
but as for tongue popping
don't just put ur tongue flat against the roof of ur mouth
you have to fold/curve/wrinkle ur tongue to make an air pocket then snatch it
think like suction cup or bubble wrap
Aww, this video is so nicely put together

I don't know how to say I LOVE YOU to people 😅
I'll be 43 in a week and a half and I still don't know how to love myself and manage my life.
Happy (belated) Birthday and thanks for the great video, mate.
Happy birthday gorgeous. Thank you for always being you.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!🎊🎁🎂🎈🎉 Love you!!!!!
Happy Birthday Tyler!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!! I love you and your videos so much. Thank you for everything you do and inspiring me 🎉❤️
I am turning 31 on the 29th of March. 
I still don't know how/when to stand up for myself or when it would be considered selfish. I don't know how to /stop/ picking at my fingernails. I really don't know how to get and then stay, in shape.
happy birthday :)

Happy Birthday Tyler. 🇺🇸🥰 🌈😎🤓🌈

HAPPY BORTHDAY TYLET! I'm 22 and I still don't fully understand how to do my taxes
Happy birthday tyler I love you so much 
I still don’t know what do I wanna do in life

Tyler, I have just the opposite problem that you have.  I know everything about literally anything!
So many youtubers talk about everything they’ve learned and know in their years, so this was a refreshing idea. I’m 21 and idk how to not be too over enthusiastic in work emails!
It’s my birthday too! ♈️🎂💖💕

Happy late birthday, Tyler! Love the message you’re spreading!
Happy B-Day and thanks for all you do.
Happy birthday Tyler 💞
Love this! Love you! Happy birthday!
Happy Birthday 🎂 Tyler! I'm 31 and still can't figure out as well with new people when to show my weird side or play it cool? No clue. Or fitted sheet folding. Mysteries to me.
Happy Birthday. When you get into your thirties is may happen that you won't be able to finish peeing unless you get all your stored up fart out. Don't be scared. It sometimes will happen to a person. :P
I'm not saying my age and I don't know how to prepare myself for the early spring video
This video was sooo cute and amazing. Loved it
I was 35 last month, and I too do not know how to tell my left from my right without using my hands. Happy birthday!!!!
Happy birthday! 🎉 hope you have a great day love you ❤️😘

Happy birthday 🎂 Tyler
Happy birthday.  I'm not sure what I don't know.  I'm 30+ and have stopped counting.  😜
i literally started watching you when i was like 8 and now my 18th birthday is coming up... wtf tyler - where did the time go
Happy birthday! 🎈🎂🎁 There may be some thing you don’t know how to do (like all of us don’t know something?) but thankfully you can make great YouTube content and have been for 12 years! Looking forward to the future and the great man you have (and will continue to) become! Love you 😍
I'm 41 and I still don't know how to live my life since my husband of 17.5 years died in 2017.
25 and still don't know how to socialize in a normal way, without rambling or be completely weird and awkward... and regretting everything I said afterwards.
Anyway, happy birthday, hope you have a wonderful day!
I am 37 !! Love your YouTube channel and your book !! Happy Birthday!!
Happy birthday, Tyler. Hope you’re having a great day! 🎁🎂3️⃣0️⃣ I’m 26 and I still don’t know what my future holds.
DAMMMMNNNNN HOWTHE HELL YOU 30 YOU LOOK AMAZING
Happy Birthday lovely💗💗

And I literally don't know anything important

Except cool youtube channels and the names of all the BTS members 😂
Nice editing from your "editing person", which I'm so — so, so — glad that you got a good techie person to do all of that. YouTube is / should be all about truth — video captures truth like no other medium — and visuals. Happy Birthday, and thank you for adding so much to my life from afar. Your storytelling magic has added immensely to my enjoyment/learning/pondering here.
wishing you the best on your birthday.  keep on rocking it.
24! (25 in April) and I still don’t know what the hell im doing haha
But you DO know how to be extremely extra 😂
I dunno, but my birthday is tomorrow and when I figure things out I will let you know! 🎂
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER💕
Happy birthday Tyler have fun and take care of yourself today ❤️
Happy Birthday! I'm 49 and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up 😋
Happy birthday hope it is an amazing day
You can wear black and blue together, as long as it involves that vest.  Happy Birthday Daddy.
Happy birthday Tyler! 🤗
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!!!!! I hope you have a wonderful day today and everyday of this new venture into 30! One thing you do know how to do is to be an inspiring, kind, exceptional human being and I admire the hell out of you for it. Love you, adore you, all the things ♥️🌈🧁
Happy birthday, boo!❤
That moment when we are all Tyler Oakley
Happy birthday tyler!!!🎂🎂
Happy 30th Birthday Tyler! You have grown so much these past 12 years! 
I’ve been subscribed since 2013 and it’s been an honor to watch you develop into such a confident and beautiful person. I’m 19 years old and still don’t know where this life is going to take me. Your late teens and early 20s I feel is full of unknowns and big spurts of growth and I’m ready for the ride.
I’ll be 21 in May and I still can’t drive
I'm 16 and I don't know how to react appropriately around people 🤦🏾
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! How the actual hell are you 30? You look like 20
I just turned 28 today! And I still have no idea how to maintain adult friendships lol. Happy birthday, birthday twin!! 🥳🥳
Happy birthday!! Hope it was even a fraction of the fabulousness that you are!
H A P P Y  B I R T H D A Y
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER 🖤 you are special, hope this day is great, hope this year is even BETTER! i love you and i’m grateful for you. i wouldn’t be who i am today if u weren’t who you are... probably. you mean the world to me :’) happy birthday i’m never tired of supporting you!!!!!! thank u for everything. 

as long as you are happy and proud of what you do i am happy and proud to be a part of it. forever & always 🌹
Almost 28 and I don't even know what to have for breakfast tomorrow. Happy birthday! :)
Started listening to Psychobabble and  following you and Korey (even watched your season of Amazing Race, you guys killed it!) You both make me laugh so much! I listen at the gym (and the car, the shower,the grocery store...) and laugh loudly pretty sure I look insane! Love your discussions on serious topics and all the work you do. Seriously a breath of fresh air on this crazy world we live in. Keep doing you!
Happy birthday love! 💛
Happy birthday!!! I'm 16, and there are so many things I still don't know how to do!! The main one is probably not being myself, and not knowing how to act in social situations. <3
I turned 28 just slightly over a month ago and this video resonates with me so much! Definitely thought I would have shit figured out and feel like an adult at this point but NOPE! 😂 Turns out we’re all just making it up as we go along!
Happy birthday Ty❤ I hope you had a great day😊
Happy Birthday to one of the best and greatest 😘😘😘 I’m 33 soon to be 34 and I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up.
Happy 30th! I am the same age and I still don’t know how to pay taxes. 😬
I’m 22 and I don’t know how to do my taxes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
We get it, Tyler, you have a nice apartment.
I'm 20 (almost 21) and I still don't know how to drive a car.
Happy Birthday Tyler!! Im 27, and I still don't know how to find my dream man or woman!
I got another six months till I'm 30 :( your looking more muscly everytime I watch and the left right thing.... Ye I do that the only thing useful I learned at swimming :)
Happy birthday, Tyler! You don't look 30 at all. We love you! Have a great time!
I'm 40 and I still don't know how when I should go see a Dr. when I'm sick
Turn on your defrost to get rid of that fog on your windshield. Happy Birthday! 🥳

Happy birthday!! I hope it’s amazing!!

I’m 23 and I don’t know how to tie my shoes, I don’t know how to talk on the phone to the bank or another important business without being so anxious I need to lie down after it, I don’t know how to math, I don’t know how to keep my concentration on track for a long period of time, I don’t know how to measure out the right amount of pasta, I don’t know how to stop myself babbling, I don’t know how to respond properly to formal emails, I don’t know how to truly write a CV (resumé) without it looking like an example from that one lesson we got in school and I don’t know when enough is enough when listing things I don’t know 😂
Happy b-day im 9 years and i dont now how to divide....lol......

Happy birthday Tyler! Hope you have an awesome one! I am 22 and I still never learned how to speak French. Been wanting to since I was 11. I still don't know how to take a cute selfie. I don't know how to write a postcard. I don't know how to write a resume or anything related to that. So pretty much, adulting is hard.
I’m shook you’re 30 wth. Where did the time go?
Holy guacamole happy birthday! I’m 21 and I don’t know what to have for dinner

Always let your weirdness come out with new friends,  because if they don't accept that they are not a true friend
Can we just appreciate the editing in this video 🙌🙌 also I’m 18 and I don’t know how to budget
I'm 31, I am confident in almost every respect of my life except I don't know how to find someone to date and if I did I don't believe that someone will be into me as a romantic partner
I love how I’m a girl and I can do a straight guy handshake
13 and still don't know what my teacher means by "diameter" "pi" "circumference" and the like
I turned 18 a few days ago and still don't know how to answer a phone call without being awkward or doing a phone call without being hella nervous... I need help xD

I’m turning 17 in June and I don’t know how to  not yeet away as fast as I can when I see someone from school in public.
I am 26, and I still don’t know how to not put myself first without being egotistical. (I am a people pleaser). Happy Birthday Tyler!
I also don’t know when fruits ripe, when pastas done, how to spell restaurant, how to change a tire, how get the fog off the window😂, how to do a straight handshake, where I see myself in five years, OR how to not thirst over Tyler Oakley’s mouth watering arms🤤😋💪🏻😂

Cute video! Happy birthday Tyler! I’m 23 years old and I still have a hard time spelling restaurant and definitely (thanks auto-correct for the help).
I am 23 and I still don't know if I'm doing what I should be.
Vogue is quaking!
Im 31 still don't know how to dive a car
Hahahaha great. Some of these are so like me
I'm 35 and glad you can at least admit you can't approach politics without bias because I know you'd want to smack this gay Republican upside the head if we met. I certainly can't parallel park but all the places I've lived, I've never needed it. The only time I had to do it (outside my driving test) was when I visited San Fran.
Queen you still look 20 wtf
this Lady Gaga in Space 2015 is going to bother me for the rest of my life. That being said, Happy Birthday Tyler! You are the the embodiment of a whisky that gets finer the older it is.
Happy birthday my queen!!! I'm 15 next month and I still don't know how to get a train/bus ticket! I also don't know how to get over Dan's absence
I’m 13 and I don’t know how to do mostly anything 😂
I'm 16 and I don't know why I have 10 different brands of chapstick in my backpack and only ever use the same one.

- look presentable to society and parents 
- not be distracted by the Internet 24 / /

Hi Tyler can you give me a ticket for ur meetup at university of pitt. The organizers won’t all me to come just cuz I’m graduate students and it’s nothing inclusive to me. Thank you
I'm 28 and I still don't know how to ask for help. As an only child of immigrant parents, I had to grow up too fast to help them. And I still don't know how to interpret/translate English to Spanish well... 🤷‍♀️

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!
I'm 15 and I still don't know how to cope with depression like symptoms (I have not been diagnosed by a doctor yet, only my therapist). One thing I DO know is that I'm bi, and you helped me realise that 5 years ago, as the first openly gay person I knew. Thank you for being a role model for a lot of people, and may your thirties be your best decade yet!
im 19 and i still don't know what i want to do for the rest of my life!!!
Happy birthday! Im 15 :)
i’m 18 and there’s a lot of shit i don’t know but i can’t really think of anything specific at the moment,, so there’s that.
how can you don't know how to cook pasta? how the f*ck do you live?!
Taylor Swift  recently did an essay for a magazine about 30 things she learned before turning 30.... You should  check it out.  Happy Birthday!
I am 19 and still do not know how to not ramble during interviews... oops
First of all,HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎂🎁🎉🎈🎊🍾🤡😘
I’m going to be 66 in a month and I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. I have done a lot of things and I have enjoyed learning and doing but I never settled on one thing. Maybe that’s it, maybe I wanna be a tryer of new things.
I'm 30 years old too.
I don’t know how are you so cool...
I'm 24 and I still don't know how to do life..
I am 35 and I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up.... I should get on that lol

I’m 18 and I don’t know what to do with my life)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!
14
I don’t know what’s more dead inside me or this channel
Ти гей лол🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy birthday!!!!!!!!!!
Turning 41 in 17 days and I still don't know how to do a lot of what you described! However, I've learned that learning and growth is a LIFELONG process and WHATEVER you are trying to grow in, being intentional in growing in SOMETHING a little bit every day is half the battle!
I'm 25 and I still have really poor social skills. I mean, a guy could say "wanna hang?" and I'd be like "sure" and don't know what that means in the end. Or someone tells me that netflix and chill means sex, but I end up actually watching netflix and chilling (probably while stuffing my face). I never know how to pick up the check for myself and the other person without making it awkward and I certainly have never figured out where joking crosses over into flirting.
56 and love

Actually ik how to check if pasta is done, at least for spaghetti, throw it on the wall and if it sticks its done if not then it isn't. I also know how to change oil and change a tire. Uncle is a mechanic so that helps lol. I kinda know how to throw a ball, I'm better at soccer though. (My oldest sister is as old as you except she doesn't turn 30 until October and you are way more mature and cool than her) Also I'm 15 and I don't know what its like to be straight/heterosexual and I never will (and that is fine with me)

Meu deus como ele tá diferente de quando eu assistia ele religiosamente
Let an old fogey chime in here.  I'm 61 and still don't know how to enjoy coffee.  I don't know why sports creates such admiration in its fans.  I don't know why the world is so hateful.  And finally I don't know why Trump has a cultish following who admire him so much blatant disregard for our democracy and all.
Hello dear friends! sorry, my English is very bad. it so happened that in my family there was a trouble, my sister was seriously ill, but the doctors say that everything will be fine if you do the operation. Our family and friends have raised almost all the money, but we have very little left. If each of you will donate at least 1$, it will help my sister and she will be able to live as before. thank you all who will respond to this. my QIWI number is +79046146806. Thanks.
I know I'm late but....

Belated Happy 30th birthday Tyler! I love you so much! You inspire me everyday! Thank you for everything! Wishing you all the happiness & success in your life forever & always!❤❤😘😘💕💕 #HappyBirthdayTyler

Cough*brendon urie should be at pride*cough
The problem isn’t Ariana as a person, it’s just how the limited tickets - and far increased prices - effect queer people who want to feel safe at pride and experience it.  And it’s concerning considering people who aren’t allies may take it as an opportunity to just see her. I really liked your points Tyler!
im mostly upset about there being high ticket prices for pride making pride an exclusive event which it shouldnt
I think Brendon Urie should be there because he has been a lgbtq+ activist for a really really long time and he is lgbtq+
my main issue when people say pride is a queers only event is it leaves closeted people out of pride. I knew a lot of closeted queer people who didn't feel comfortable going to pride last year bc there was so much debate about whether nonqueers were allowed. pride should be a place where everyone is welcome to celebrate queerness and to learn about the rich history of the queer rights movement. even if someone is straight and cis they should be welcome to celebrate that history with us
Green Day should play at pride! They’ve been supportive since forever, and 2 of 3 members are bisexual :)

Where my lgbtq+ gang at? 🌈
I'm straight but I will support you all no matter what
Hayley kiyoko should be headlining instead and that's the tea
I think we need more LGBTQ artists to headline but that doesn’t mean allies can’t join in too.
i feel like people who aren’t lgbtq+ supportive will end up going because of ariana and they will ruin it
I’ve been out the loop with your videos for a few years to be honest, when did you get so ripped Tyler, Jesus you look GOOD
It just makes me uncomfortable that people that aren't LGBT+ are going to go and be homophobic or transphobic. Plus, pride is usually cheap or free but now the prices are going up and it's supposed to be accessible to underage queer kids who just want a safe space.
i think brendon urie should perform considering everything he has done for the community 🌈
In all honesty, I feel like Tyler is 100% right about who and who can not be at pride. I do feel like Ariana, regardless of her own sexuality, is definitely very outspokenly an LGBTQ+ advocate, and she’s definitely someone I feel can be allowed into a queer safe space, because she’s always been someone who has made queer people feel safe herself. I also feel like it’s worth a mention that if bigoted establishment owners “reserve the right not to serve LGBTQ+” then, the queer community can reserve the right not to have someone they feel hasn’t properly represented their culture at their own festival.
If you're willing to oppose anti-LGBTQ+ things then you're welcome at Pride.
If you're supporting one or more LGBTQ+ friends then you're welcome at Pride.
If you want to learn more about LGBTQ+ things then you're welcome at Pride.
If you just want to show some LGBTQ+ support then you're welcome at Pride.


If you're any of these things then we want to see you at Pride <3
im all for ariana at pride, but im not for her homophobic/transphobic fans that are coming for a concert taking away the limited space for queer people and true allys
WOW THIS IS THE CONTENT I ASKED FOR
I personally think that at THIS POINT we should put lgbtq artists on the main stage. Everybody is invited tho but the headliner must be lgbtq+ otherwise whats the point?
The LGBTQ community loves to include people, but we also love to exclude people, including our own. I tried going to my own local Pride as a bisexual but was trash talked because I’m currently dating a cisgender male and I am a female. But then when I went with my ex girlfriend a few years ago, no one batted an eye. Ya’ll act like you know everything about everyone and then exclude your own people because of biases. 
So maybe instead of worrying about an ally going to pride, focus on actually accepting your own people first.
I honestly never thought that inviting an ally to pride was an issue until you pointed out that Ariana's appearance will draw a crowd and it may include people who are not supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. Being from the middle of the USA, our pride isn't much. It's literally a little parade mostly made up of supportive churches, businesses and political candidates. We don't have performances. Going to pride as an "ally" is what helped me decide to come out. So while I do think pride is for everyone who is a part of the community or supports the community, I definitely now see the other side of the argument. Here in the middle though, without big performances, I'm going to say pride is definitely for everyone. The more people we get to attend pride, hopefully the more allies we gain in our fight for equality in our community.
This is so relevant 😭 I came out to my parents as bi today! Thank you Tyler 🏳️‍🌈♥️
tyler, i’m gonna be honest. i like freaked out over this on twitter the other day. yes, ariana is straight but she’s been supportive for years so i get it, it’s still kind of weird that she is headlining but okay i’ll take it i guess. 
my problem is not with ariana though, she wants to be supportive and her intentions are GOOD. but she has no control over how other people act, she is right now the biggest artist worldwide. she WILL have another concert in manchester, she said, but that date is not out yet so naturally people are anxious and want whatever they want IMMEDIATELY. knowing she is gonna perform at pride and not having the other date available everyone is gonna want to go to her show at pride, that includes a lot of straight people. which makes sense because she IS straight and mainstream.
a lot of queer people talked about this saying “if you want to see ariana wait for her other date, pride is for queer people. we don’t want straight people at pride, etc” and the heteros LOST IT.
every comment was “this is so ignorant, you are so ignorant straight people can be there to support!!!1!”
and this were her fans. i got upset.
“we can be at pride to support !” nO. Y’ALL WERENT GONNA GO TO “SUPPORT” BEFORE ARIANA ANNOUNCED SHE WAS GONNA HEADLINE THE FESTIVAL. YOU WANT TO GO TO A CONCERT, YOU WANT TO SEE ARIANA..... you don’t care about supporting, or you didn’t before u knew ariana was gonna be there. why do you all of a sudden want so badly to support? were you gonna go anyways if ariana wasn’t headlining? and i swear to god, they answered to QUEER people complaining with “you are ignorant and PROBLEMATIC” instead of LISTENING. if you are calling lgbtq+ people ignorant and problematic for not wanting straight people at pride for their own selfish reasons (wanting to go to a concert lmao) then YOU are problematic and ignorant and you should not call yourself an ally “have you heard of allies lmao” stfu. i have heard of them, you clearly aren’t one if you react this way instead of listening to queer people from your place of fucking privilege. 
i understand when straight family members come to support their queer loved ones. it’s cute and i get it. that’s one thing, another completely different thing is a huge artist like ariana performing at pride which will bring sooo many straight people because they DONT CARE that it’s pride THEY CARE THAT SHE IS THERE. a couple of heteros supporting? okay. a whole ass CROWD THERE TO ONLY SEE ARIANA? hell NO. 

and this is inevitable, ariana has no control over it. maybe she should know better? who knows. but i’m over straight people calling heterophobia, shut up.
if i were straight i would try to understand and i would LISTEN to queer people from my place of privilege cause i would know NOTHING about the struggle that comes with being queer or about pride itself. i would do that instead of attacking them and trying to tell them how to feel as minorities. y’all don’t act like allies so don’t even think about showing up.



sorry tyler i love you thank you for this
starting my day right with a gay tyler video 🤠💗🌈
really love your thoughts on this! If you are going to show up on pride, show up for queer people the rest 364 days of the year!
Found from twitter: (not me)

Ariana was also headlining Coachella, who’s founder/owner gives large donations to National Christian Foundation which funds groups trying to “chip away” at LGBTQ+ rights in America.
Good video! It's true you didn't touch on the ticketing, which is more likely to box queer than straight people out statistically, but like you said, straight female icons and legends have long headlined pride, and there's also an added dimension with Ariana and the city of Manchester, which LOVES her forever. 
I do think it's sad and a bit wrong that randoms will buy 'tickets' as if it were an Ari concert, but then tbh we should be having a conversation about the commercialisation of Pride.
We really should. How is a 'pride' event ticketed?! Queer Rich People Pride, or Queer Pride For All? 
Fuck these heteronormative capitalist entrance fees, beech. x
tyler! you should watch/react to andi mack
pride is for the lgbt+ community, but it's also for our allies: friends, family, those who stick by when others don't. i can't have pride without my allies, because i wouldn't be who i am today without them. as a queer woman, i couldn't survive without the people who have stuck by me. without allies at pride, half of the story would be gone.
I like what you're saying here, and I agree, and it's important. BUT... I could not stop looking at your shoulders. 😳❤ 
I'm gonna go work out now.
Well spoken Tyler.  I'm straight and my sister is gay and has married her soul mate. I support the LGBTQ+community  because of you Tyler. You made a statement the first year you did The chosen Family series. You said if we aren't standing up for our LGBTQ+ family or friends then we dont belong with y'all.  That hit home with me. So now I really support the whole LGBTQ + Family. Thank you for helping me see how to support my sister and all the others out there
I’m from London. I like the idea of going. But it’s always a Saturday in June and I’m always playing cricket then. Last year I did really well on the day of London pride. That has to come first for me. Gays can be sporty too!

Personally I’ve never really been into her (Ariana Grande’s) music, I just don’t think it’s for me. I trust Tyler when he says she has been a good ally. That’s good, I wish we had more allies. 

For what I think about Pride, the more it becomes like a party or a concert the less likely I am to go. I think I’d prefer a LGBTQ+ person to be leading. Yet the aspect not mentioned is that this is Manchester and it makes sense that Grande is headlining there due to her connection with the city after what happened there. I think realising that makes it harder to argue against her being there.

The big companies who try to get in on pride make me feel uneasy. It feels forced, and laced with poorly concealed ulterior motives in their expressions of support. I see more calculation than genuineness in such interventions. 

I rather think Pride still needs to be a protest, there is still a long way to go.
I think performing at pride, including headlining, should be an opportunity granted to an lgbt+ artist because they are still an underrepresented demographic in the music industry and face unique challenges. To give away the opportunity of performing in front of hundreds of thousands of "their people" to a non-lgbt+ artist is a shame. Also seeing an lgbt+ artist thrive will inspire others to follow their footsteps. It's one thing to show up and say "I'm here for you" but it's another thing entirely to show up and say "I AM you." Mainstream non-queer artists should show their allyship by showing up and supporting lgbt+ artists and maybe join them on stage for a song or two  But they shouldn't be picked as the main entertainment. We got thousands of other festivals for that.
Queer necessity: Carlos Vara “Confidant” 3:03 YES !! 🔥🔥🔥
Also strait and cisgender pepole are allowed at pride in my book as long as they are respectful
I have no issue with Ariana Grande but I also think we need to continue the conversation of who it's for. Not just about allies attending, I fully support that, but also the atmosphere and culture. You mentioned that a big artist like Ariana will expose people to lgbt+ culture, but is Pride truly representative of lgbt+ culture or just flamboyant gay men? And with the increased sexualization, and alcohol involved in Pride does it alienate lgbt+ youth, and family of lgbt+ individuals?
They should of gotten Brendon Urie because why not
Finally starting to internalize my queerness. When you say “we” I finally hear myself in that word. Kinda cool 😎.
So people are seriously making lists of types of people who are not allowed to attend an event that is ultimately about acceptance and inclusivity? The irony.
I love you Tyler ... thank you for making me laugh when I’m having bad days ❤️
I have a question, as a straight person, is it okay for me to walk a pride parade, to show my respect and support for the LBGTQ+ community? and in that case, how do I show my support and respect in the best way possible? thanx!
I like your opinion - thanks for sharing it 🏳️‍🌈
Is Ariana not a gay icon??? Not into this YOU and US phrase are we not trying to be ONE!!! Not gay, not straight, not big and not trans. Can I still come??? Take care and stay safe 💖💖💖
We invited them to pride when it was a riot and they didn’t show..... now that it’s a party they went and invited themselves 🙄 we don’t need anymore spaces for cishets there’s enough of those already
I think we share the same opinion... Ari is gays /girls favorite and we want queer people to be able to enjoy themselves at pride so why not Ari..
Ariana's consert or Manchester pride... both are FUN
Yes, Pride is a celebration of the QUEER community, but let's not forget the origin of Pride has always been to commemorate the Stonewall riots.  I say all who support us are welcome.
I think anyone should be at pride as long as there supportive “my opinion”
Happy Birthday Tyler!! I hope you have a wonderful day and a wonderful year? 😊👍🌟🎂
Still giving us such wholesome content! I have to stan
I love you, Tyler and you're my inspiration in the world!!!
Tyler what happened to the frickin q and slay gurlllll! I MISS THEM SO FREAKING MUCH! I want you to know that i love you so much and has been watching since around 2013. I love how supportive u r about the lgbtq+ community. I am 11 years old and bi, and you really helped me find who I truly am!❤️ love you so much!!❤️❤️ thank you for getting me through the hard times❤️
I'm bisexual and I love that you talked about biphobia. Ik people on internet are really supporting of bisexuals but people around me are such jerks. It's good to see u talking about it.
As for pride, there are no pride marches in my city and hence I would just enjoy clips on the internet.
I'm from Manchester and think it's 100% ok

Hi, Tyler! Would you like to make series, or at least a more long film on Pride? It would be really great to gain some knowledge before the Pride month. Just an idea 🐳🌺 lots of love! ❤️
Tyler!! How’s the plant wall doing?🌿
Cough*Adam Lambert should perform*cough
1:03 Listen to that and think on it. We love you, Tyler 💕💕🌙
Could not have said this better Tyler. #HappyAlmostPrideMonth
Pride isnt as open as people want it to be.  I have had many LGBTQ+ people be threatened at pride by their community because they are conservative. The conservatives aren't welcome and that isnt very progressive of the LGBTQ+ community. I dont like seeing my friends hurt because what they would be a supportive community isnt supportive of them because they have different political opinions.
I hear that some prides are going to charge money to get in and that’s the real part of the pride controversy that makes me go :/
Came from the IG live ✨🌈💗🧡💛💚💙💜🌈✨
I want to go into media as a career and I would love to help the LGBTQ+ community 🌈
Yasssss Queen! Love you Tyler!
I believe that everyone should be able to come not matter if your gay or not everyone should be proud of who they are no matter if they are straight or gay pride should be for everyone 🏳️‍🌈
"Manchester Pride is a music festival"
I support you tyler💖
"There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."

Nope. I refuse to accept that it's nearly June. I need more time before my exam 😂
LOOOOOOOOVE THIS! LOVE U TOO TYLER!
You just said everything I've been thinking for as long as this argument has been going around. Thank you for putting your thoughts into  comprehensive words!!
Straight Friend: My husband doesn't want you around our kids when we have them.
Me: Ummmm?? (Is this a joke?)
Straight Friend: We had a great weekend we went to the gay bar, they have the best music. They hit on my husband but we're ok with it. 
Me: Yeah we're done.
Loved your video Tyler , made me interested in support LGBTQ rights more openly ! And help other finds love no matter what gender 👍🏻😁
We’re still waiting on your comment on the nick Jonas gospel cover of jealous!!!!
Thank you for making a video on this!
I know im late but i just started reading binge a couple days ago and OMG I LOVE IT
The 1975 should have preformed, there literally from Manchester and have always been supportive of the lgbt community eg. loving someone
I love the content that Tyler is putting out now. It seems like he is really enjoying what he is doing. ❤️
Sure 
and jay z should be at pride yeah?
Omg we are near to he pride month! I literally didn't think about that...
put her pride flag into a trash can
I just didn't.
Gonna go listen to some queer artists, thank you 


<3
Anyone who is apart of the community or supports the community is allowed at pride. Periodt
Hi i love you so much!!! So happy to see your smile again this week !! You're brightening up my day!!❤
Little Mix should peform!!
Wow, this channel is DEAD.     RIP Tyler Oakley
omg hey ik this was before Monopoly ~came out~ but Ari is queer
I know of people who are cishet and trying to get tickets because ariana grande will be there (that I have heard being OPENLY queerphobic). Do I think Ariana should be at pride? No. Would I feel safe with people like that there? No.
"Understand that you're kind of the guest to the party" yes tyler
I haven't watched a tyler video in a while but man Tyler got built!
Omg, I forgot about much I love your videos! You examine events in media without showing a bias, being un-opinionated, but still talk about how you feel. Thanks for the awesome video as always!
I love you Tyler Oakley! You are so awesome! Plus I love Ariana grande!! 💕
talking about this with my straight friends...
getting the obligatory question why they don't get a straight pride.
Well... she came out! Wasn’t expecting it but also I think being a fan I wasn’t TOO surprised. More surprised on how she casually dropped the lyric in the song then replied to a tweet about it but go her! Still think your point stands for other actually heterosexual artists though
I plan on going to my first pride because I moved to SF recently from the East Bay and SF is like THE GAY CAPITAL of America. I'm a volunteer for St. James Infirmary, a nonprofit that focuses (but isn't limited to) sex workers. Some of my co-workers said that SF pride has turned into an excuse for straights to get wasted and just party. Those who have been to SF pride, or any pride in general, is this true?
How it’s almost pride it’s March 😂
Yass another video this has made my day
OMG...i stopped watching Tyler for a while...but now, he looks better than ever👍
Thank you Tyler, you've voiced this very nicely. 🖤🖤🖤
we love a commentary/tea video! keep it comin’

i get very frustrated with how commercialised pride becomes - which is probably the cause of a majority of a non-queer presence at the events. like during the parades i would say maybe 75% of it is estate agencies, banks, supermarkets etc with these huge floats or groups announcing "we support our lgbtq+ employees" but the second the end of june comes they remain silent on anything queer related. i think what you said about non-queer allies being at pride, they are there more as guests than members, and these corporations and performers like ariana should not use this event as an opportunity to feel good about themselves because they're being supportive. like the lgbtq+ and glaad awards are a very good example of how there's so much emphasis on awarding people for not being queer-phobic it's just all ego driven
I think she should be at pride after the attack in Manchester and I think she’s perfect for pride❤️
this is a really good video! i think part of the issue is that queerness has become more and more commodified, especially when it comes to pride. it's become something corporations—and people—can profit off of. selling ridiculously-priced tickets (and honestly, selling tickets at all) for an event that is supposed to be a celebration and/or protest of identity is another part of the commodification of a minority identity that a lot of people rightfully take issue with. there's no reason she couldn't have stipulated that tickets had to be free and made that a part of the performance agreement. SF pride has never charged for any musical event, and it's a PARTY.


 ariana purports to be an ally of the lgbtq community, and she's done a lot of good things for it, but she's also recently come under fire BECAUSE she's been appropriating other cultures and relationships for profit (commodifying them!!). the japanese tattoo, for one, and selling merch with japanese characters on them (that also literally don't mean what she thinks they mean), but also using a wlw relationship in her music video for shock value. 


people used to risk their lives to attend pride, and now she's gonna throw a concert that blatantly homophobic fans are going to attend, thereby endangering the very safe space lgbtq people have worked so hard to create for themselves.


i think this is a learning moment for a lot of people, and i think she means well—i just think it's a lot more complicated than a lot of people realize and there are a lot of implications to her performance.
Pride is so special to me because there is nothing like looking out at a crowd and knowing that the majority of them are lgbtq+. Straight allies are an addition to that, but they really need to be spending all the year working as an activist.
great video Tyler xo
I live in Manchester and I’m going.
You make my day better with new videos ! ❤️❤️❤️
Who needs help growing their twitter? 🌙
Lgbtq+ pride is for me : for lgbtq+ only but straights are also aloud sure... it's about our culture and support but as you say it's not just some party weekend where people from like my class to come and drink and party and that's it... it's about supporting us and being for us when someone walks the street and gets bullied or in school they should also step up and help and defend us... you can't bully the Gay kids and then party at pride month because you're bored..... and need a reason to drink.
We as a community are begging for acceptance and inclusivity, were FIGHTING for it. Who is “allowed” feels wrong to me. Pride is not only about shining light on our culture but also allowing ourselves to celebrate each other and accept love from people who support us. Ariana has ALWAYS been an ally and paved the road for many other artists to support our community. 

With this being said, I do agree that ticket prices being jacked up due to our Queen performing is wrong, and that is the only topic we should be discussing/protesting. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Thank you for saying all of this!
Hey king!! It has been a minute! Love you!!  -Rose @niftyoakley
I, personally, think that Ariana Grande should not headline pride, for many reasons but two of them are 1) she queerbated with break up with your girlfriend, which is not okay and 2) we should have a queer person headline. A straight person shouldn't be the main event at a gay* celebration.

Pride is a place where the Gays*™️ can celebrate and appreciate each other and how far the community has come, so I believe that having a straight person be the headliner would slightly disrespect the struggle of our community. 

Those are my 2 cents. I would love to continue the discussion (not arguement please) in the comments

Sincerely, your local lesbian rat
I agree with you 100%
it’s 20th of march- spring 2019. ;)
I definitely do agree on most of what you said. There is certainly one thing which bothers me though.
You said that an alley is always there and shouldn’t be there if they’re not here the rest of the year but in all honesty, I understand when allies don’t prioritize LGBTQ subjects. They support us, they don’t discriminate us, they are comfortable around queer people but they’re not queer themselves so I can understand when they’re not around for all of the year because it’s not their fight to win. They may help for sure. But still, allies are not part of our community, they are outsiders who may join us when they like or when they feel obligated to do so.
I hope this somehow makes sense, at least in my head it does but yeah, feel free to discuss the topic with me. I’m always down for a conversation as long as all parties are respectful:)
Thank you for speaking my truth
Whilst I agree with most of your points. The problem is the limited tickets, the price (being nearly $100 for the main event, plus additional costs to gain access to the gay village in Manchester), the lack of queer representation at the main events of these major prides in the UK and how commercialised pride has now become, especially in the UK! Companies now are just slapping a rainbow flag on their brand but they're not actually donating anything in support of LGBTQ+ issues.

As a queer artist myself, I feel very upset at those committees for the lack of queer representation on the main stage, no drag queen performances or known queer artists on the main stage in and around the main cities.

I had the opportunity to perform at my local pride last year and it felt INCREDIBLE because we had the sense of community and the day was just filled with love and all things queer!
Me and you have the same birthday
The simplest answer is: NOT COPS.
Ok let's stop the fight of who was the 1st comment let's be clear it was me
Also, Ariana waving a Pride flag on stage isnt showing up for the community, but ok.
Tyler: “Who should go to Pride?”
Me: Me!!!!!!!!!!
loved to watch a video of you talking about your thoughts! I wouldn't be mad about more of that. plus, cute hair :)
I think your arms are looking good Tyler Oakley
your videos deserve moooore views and likes and everything good  x
personally i feel like she is perfectly fine being at pride, but maybe headline should be saved for queer artists. there are so many queer artist who 100% deserve to headline who aren’t because ariana grande is. also, people should show up to support LGBTQ at pride but with her there, it will be more of a concert than a pride event
I have a trans friend who is also gay and he is my closest friend. I'm straight but I'm here for all y'all. You all give me inspiration everyday! Also I wish I could take him to pride! ❤❤❤
It’s been a hot minute since I’ve watched one of your videos and you just look like a gay, slightly buff uncle who has trouble finding a vegan boyfriend
I’m going to my first pride parade soon!!! Ahhhh I can’t wait


I mean I’m telling people I’m an Ally so I’m not targeted for bullying but I can’t wait to be surrounded by supportive people for a day❤️🏳️‍🌈
Wish I could go to Pride or any of the LGBT+ festivals throughout the year in US! Don't have anyone to take me.
This is a great video for me to send my friends before they join me at pride. They'll have some context for our conversations and hopefully be inspired to learn more before we go! Thanks Tyler!
Originally I had a visceral reaction to the video title; I felt like you were going to support someone for being an ally, despite not being a part of our community. But I completely agree with your opinion. If they are fighting the good fight, we need their help. Love you, Tyler!
Christina Aguilera has been a Voice for the LGBTQ community before it was popular in 1999/2000. Shes being awarded with the Human Right Campaign this month for her support of the LGBTQ community and fighting against HIV/AIDS on March 30, 2019!!!! 😍❤️ stay tune and watch guys! (:
Ari loves us gays, and the rest of our beautiful community. We should welcome her with open arms in knowing she will be speaking out for our progress!!
I'm trying my best to be a better allay in every way I can 💪👌
brendon urie should perform
OMG, when did you become so buff?
DAMN my ty thai mai tai LOOKIN JACKED
i totally agree that pride should be for anyone who supports the community all year long. the whole point of pride is excepting and supporting everyone for who they are so if someone is there for the community (if they are really there for the community) thats just another step forward even if they are straight... my mom was pretty prejudiced about the topic but the more i talked to her about these things the more she opened up and last year i actually got her to go to pride with me holding pride flags and smiling at couples passing by us and i was really proud of her i think its great <3
As, someone who's Bi- sexual, i may not be able to go to pride which is sad, because it took me years to come out to my family, because I was scared. Now that I have I feel so much better and I wanted to thank you Tyler, because years ago before I had my own youtube account, your videos made me feel included, like i deserved more. I apprecate you. Thank you
Brendon Urie should be at pride wtfffff
Hey Tyler I love u and I love this video
Hey Tyler I love u and I love this video
I see Ariana’s fleet about to swarm this comment section...
Tyler you need to watch skam France ... you're not ready but you have to !
Please tell me you're doing Chosen Family again!!! I'm so excited!!!
Sorry I was distracted by how fit you are!!! 😱 💪🏼
I think Ariana would be fine and great at pride its just you have to buy tickets which is not very inclusive I wish Ariana grande would have agreed to perform at a different pride that is for free for everyone and not just for the people that can afford tickets and I feel like the fact that tickets are being sold is kind of taking advantage of queer people and our culture like why do we have to pay to celebrate us?
I used to go to pride all the time with my gay homies, and I really miss going. I live in a smaller town where none of those friends are, unfortunately, so I've been missing out :(
kevin abstract should be headlining
I didn't know you were still making videos. I had to search you to see this. I've been subscribed forever
I love in Manchester, I was going to go this year for the very first time, but now ariana is going to be there as cool as that is I can't go because I wouldn't be able to afford it.
Pride is a protest. You should have too pay for tickets
Ok but on another note; Tyler is looking fittt
I really appreciate being able to hear these kinds of conversations please keep sharing your opinion on youtube to help dummies like me learn !
Hi Tyler!  I have a question!  I'm asexual, and I've been told by LGBT+ people that asexuals aren't actually part of the queer community and are therefore not welcome.  However, us asexuals don't fit in with the allies and straights because unlike them, we don't like sex/don't desire sex/have no sex drive.  What do you think?  Are asexuals welcome at Pride?  Are they part of the LGBT+ community?  Thanks!!  

(Please like this comment so Tyler sees it.  Id really like to know his thoughts)
Good points, well said😁👍
Nobody: 

Ariana Grande: as a straight gay white person of color...
I have a feeling mist of her fans would be there anyway. Lol
Lol me saying it's almost June when it is mid March
Tyler u look so strong!!!!!!! My whole king
"It's almost pride month" ohhh gurl 2 months and a half are not almost to me
i think a lot of us agree that if you’re an ally during the rest of the year you’re welcome to celebrate and support us in June, and outspoken straight ally have been welcome to perform in the past. 
The problem wasn’t that Ariana is straight, it just made the problem worse. The problem is the price increases, limited tickets, age restrictions, and corporate transformation of pride highlighted by seeing straight people spending their money to go see a straight performer (and not coming for Pride and our community)
WE NEED KING PRINCESS
Amy Lee of Evanescence should be at Pride. Why? Because Amy is perfect by nature, the Goddess of Imaginary Light. Evanescence have a bunch of songs has the lyrics that suits perfectly for LGBT community and music itself does have that Queer theme. For every Queer person. 🏳️‍🌈

What if it was Harry styles instead of Ariana? Would everyone being equally mad? Because Harry is known not to label his sexuality. Even at his own concerts he waves the pride flag and encourages and thanks fans who wave there's.
I wish more people would watch his content
Unrelated, but girl in red would be amazing at pride. Just facts
Love ya Tyler... I think ariannas brother is gay
Tyler dude isn't Frankie Grande gay? Arianna is perfect.
I saw a Tumblr post talking about the distinction of who pride is for and who is welcome. Plainly, it said pride is for LGBTQ+ people, but everyone is welcome to attend. And I thought this video did a good job elaborating on that point.
i want to talk more about the LGBTQ+ community in the music industry pls and thnx
OH TEA I WAS WAITING ON THIS
i fully support non-lgbtq people at pride as long as they remember that pride is for lgbtq people and aren't going there just because "it's a fun event" or "ariana grande is going to perform there", which i think is the main issue here. a lot of cishet folks are gonna come to manchester pride solely because ariana will be there, and most of them probably are not active allies year-round.
so does ariana grande belong at pride? i would prefer a lgbtq headliner to a cishet one, bc it makes far more sense in the context of pride, but theoretically, there's no reason she shouldn't be allowed to perform! (i love ari as well shglkdf) the only problem here is that her fans are going to come  and the tickets are going to be ridiculously expensive even for lgbtq people, *partly bc of her*. so i don't think having ariana grande headline pride is a good choice, not because she is cishet, but because of what will follow from that.
I feel like having straight people perform at pride headlining shouldn’t be problematic but on the other hand seeing a really successful LGBTQ artist (like Troy Sivan or Adam Lambert) might mean more to the queer community. 

I am an allie of LGTBQ+ people and have been for years and am trying to become more actively involved with supporting because I know it’s not enough to say you’re an allie but never actually take action.
NOTIFS ARE ALWAYS ON !!
Tyler always tells the good tea
Tyler you are TOOOO old for this.
BEWARE OF THE CHIPOTLE FLOAT TYLER! 👀
For me the issue is that the price of Manchester Pride is now more of a festival ticket price and that area of pride is only 18+. This excludes and divides a lot of lgbt+ people. Particularly poor, young, homeless LGBT+ people who should be  allowed to celebrate alongside everyone else. We're not here to have a festival, lots of queer people are literally still fighting for their rights and lives and the one place they should feel welcome is now excluding them.
I LOVE YOU. SO MUCH. LIKE WOW
Y'all if they wanna come to pride and have a good time just let them
One example of being an ally would be not performing at Coachella, given its leadership. But also it's specifically the problem of hyperfamous headline events creating an atmosphere where queer people are literally crowded out, in no small part by cishet people with no concern for pride.
Tyler!! I've been trying to reach out to you on insta, (aprilll_linnn)  i go to MSU! i'm trying to start an org for youtubers and future youtubers on campus. I would love if you had any advice or words for the org. Hope you see this<3
Ariana - absolutely!!! She is a true ally, and having her perform will help mix everyone into a fun, non-confrontational party.
no cops at pride only tyler oakley’s biceps
Ok so since A LOT OF Y'ALL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, the pride event she's headlining is a BENEFICAL CONCERT, which means that the money they're raising will go to organizations that help LGBTQ+ people in needs, THAT IS WHY IT'S OVERPRICED, what i know is that the concert is AFTER the parade, the most important event that is FREE. (i'm not really sure but i think is that way, i'm not from manchester lol) People can attend to the parade free, and pay to go to the benefical concert. For more Informativos you can google the Manchester Pride site. And about if she's allowed or not in pride... Well Tyler already said it. Good allies are always welcomed, don't let anybody make you think otherwise.
quite frankly I don't think it matters who comes u don't have to be an outspoken ally to come if u just wanna come then come simple as that
everyone is welcome if they are supportive of us
‪I personally think anyone can come to pride. But that doesn’t mean everyone belongs there/has a right to be there. Allies are very very important in this community, but I definitely agree, allies who ‬don’t support the community year round do not deserve to be at pride. I’m not an Ariana fan and don’t follow her social media or any platforms, but I’ve taken note that she’s always been supportive of the queer community so I’d give her a pass 🤷🏼‍♂️
I totally agree with you! About to go bop to queer necessities!!
Ariana can go to pride all she wants😊 the thing is though





I want to be there and I can't be
Okay so ngl I was kinda annoyed about this whole yadda yadda tea spilling stuff because I'd heard that some (insert)-phobic cishet people were just going for Ari but now that I've watched this I feel like I kinda got put in my place a little cuz like, I know the basis of pride and that it's all about inclusion and accepting who you are and supporting others and being there for people who may not have the best support systems but you do make valid points about as long as they're supporting and stuff then that's fine and they're valid to come too, and I feel like I haven't been as supportive to lgbt+ artists out there myself so imma get on that, thanks bish!!! 😘❤️
No Wristband is needed to enter the village and it is an offence for Manchester Pride to block your right of access 

Manchester Pride. The organisation which has misled the LGBT community since 2003. Telling them that a payment was needed to enter our gay village while pride was on. No payment was ever needed. In fact charging pedestrians to enter closed streets within the gay village was unlawful. They were told this way back in 2002. 

Since this became public knowledge roads within the gay village have only been closed to motor vehicles only. It is an offence for Manchester Pride to block your right of access into the gay village, unless the area becomes overcrowded. They may not prioritise wristband buyers over those without and you do not have to state where you are going. to make it clear, members of the public on foot have unrestricted right of access into the village and no one should be harassed by Manchester pride security. 

Some of the dirty tricks they are employing now at the gates is telling you no bars will serve you without a wristband. A lie because some bars served people or they will say gesture to you to show your wrist. This is only dirty tricks to try to mislead people who aren't sure of their rights as you have a legal right into the village even if no bars would serve you.

The Local Government Ombudsman ruled in April 2015 that Manchester City Council had "exceeded its powers" by including mention of wristbands in a traffic order. For ten years the public was unlawfully charged and obstructed. 

Minutes of a meeting held at Marketing Manchester in Nov 2002 show that all concerned knew it was unlawful before they started doing it the following August. For some reason the police didn't uphold the law for a decade.
Preach 🙏🏻 very valid points. I think that pride is for Queer people and active allies like you said. Having said that, I do think that Ariana is an ally for us and I think she is welcome but I don't support the increasing of the ticket prices. Allegedly that was Manchester Pride's decision which sparks a whole other convo about the people in charge exploiting our community to straight white women to get more money
Can we have Tiffany Young come to Pride?
I feel like if you're going to see Ariana Grande you should definitely also go and see at least one of the other great LGBTQ+ people there. Maybe have the ticket to the concert also include some other LGBTQ+ people thrown into the mix.
I agree with -Kate AF - as a queer it’s-hard to fell safe sometimes and some people will go just for the performance and not to support everyone else 
   This is for support and celebration not just a performance 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I completely agree, of course it’s for queer people, but it’s about expanding acceptance and awareness so having someone that famous performing gains exposure to the event. Genuine allies should be allowed to support the event as well!
Where is Pride usually held? Or is Pride an event that can be held anywhere? I've always wanted to go and meet other LGBT+ members, but I was too young and couldn't go anywhere by myself. I'm turning 18 this year. I'm really hoping to go next year, if not, then I'm definitely making plans for the year after, No hesitations
How bout we get brendon urie to headline
Oh my gaaaawd why are people so mad about non queer people to be there. Of ALL PEOPLE ARI HAS A GAY BROTHER 💁🏼‍♀️HELLOOO QUEENS so shes people the best to be there
I agree 👍
I think that allies/ non-lgbt+ people because not every who is lgbt+ is out of the closet yet and they should still be able to experience pride in a safe way by saying they are an ally
ariana is also headlining coachella, the owner of whom donates to anti-lgbtq+ groups so?
I agree with your points and I am here for allies at pride and supporting us (closeted/bi/stealth people can be mistaken for straight/cis anyway so gatekeeping makes no sense) however I think the people given a platform to perform and be a main event at Pride should be out LGBTQ+ artists to show an example and inspiration. Straight/cis artists should support us year-round and come to Pride too but headlining doesn't make sense to me. We need representation. There are so many LGBTQ+ artists it's not like there aren't enough to go around. Straight/cis people should take a backseat and uplift LGBTQ+ voices at events like this just as white people should at an event for Black History Month for example. (Can't think of another equivalent but hope makes sense!)
i love you tyler and i miss your slumber party tours!
I've only been to one pride event, which was accidental we got stuck in Brighton for my boyfriends interview for a job when pride was going on.
We went, we celebrated, I had several friends who had wanted to be there or couldn't afford it who were part of the queer community. Honestly I felt kinda guilty, but my bf took me there to spend time together before and after his interview hence the hotel we didn't intend to go to support pride.
We met a lot of people, my bf's very shy and very private with sexuality, preferences, sex etc. But I think he learnt a lot, and we got on well with the majority we met, no bad experiences. 
But this is a LGBTQ+ event for support, which tickets are sold for (high price). I kinda feel like the rich are just going to be able to attend this event and with Ariana leading there will be more straight people attending no doubt. Which might set some individuals on edge, when they are used to a very safe expressive space.
I don't know, I would never be able to afford the ticket anyway to attend I support in other ways.
I agree with you Tyler! Definitely a grey area. Not only black and white
does Tyler belong on youtube?
Happy 30th Birthday Tyler. I hope that whatever you do today on your birthday is filled with laughter and awesomeness.
I think not only has she done so much for the LGBTQ+ community, Ariana Grande has done so much for Manchester since the bombing nearly 2 years ago, so it’s not surprising that we are willing to give her a headline slot at Manchester Pride
I would def agree with you only I would have said it a bit more forcefully without all the, well this is my opinion. Which really makes me rethink and reflect on my behavior, honestly. You approached it maturely and we only learn by talking back and forth to each other. It's too easy with some of these internet platforms to talk at people. Talking with people should be the goal.
I love being a part of this family love y’all 💕💕
I would not want to arm wrestle you
I do hope Frankie goes with her though
Well thought out and stated Tyler. Yeah, sadly.. people do not understand the reason why the parade and what is the point of it .... Is she there because of her brother Frankie or because of her fan base?  I am  just curious. Your video will indeed spark plenty of conversation.
I had to write an essay about an activist and I wrote it about how you won a Trevor award
This is really thought provoking, my best friend and her mom asked me if they could come with me to pride last year, it was amazing having them there. it was like they were asking to join my family. I just saying if someone cares enough to come to pride I think you can give them a chance. I do understand why closeted people might have a problem and I'd say do what makes you feel comfortable. And I too would love Panic to head line. I had a hard time trying to name some queer performers. Do you have any you can recommend?
every year, when Pride comes around I always get really nervous because there are a lot of Queer people who don't think that Asexual people don't belong at Pride so I always either have to justify my being there or not go because it's easier. I also use to go to Pride before I was fully comfortable with who I was and it felt like a really accepting place to try and figure things out. I don't think we should be shutting doors on people coming to Pride because it's a really good opportunity to educate people and make them see that they aren't gunna "catch the gay", but I also understand the risk of letting other people in because what if something bad happens.
Hey Ty. Love you lots💕 my insta is oliviacicarelli12
At least she will learn about our culture.
Aaahhhhh! Tyler! Yay, thank. You made my day. 😊
What even is your content lately? zzz
Hayley kiyoko. No questions needed
I'm more worried about them tickets instead of homophobic people being there because of Queen Ari.
I agree with Tyler, that it doesn't matter if the artist is straight, as long as they use their platform to be an ally. My problem is specifically with Ariana Grande. This year along with headlining a pride she will also be headlining Coachella. The person-in-charge of that festival is known to be homophobic. He has donated money made by the festival to anti-queer organizations.  Ariana's presence at Coachella will draw more people to the festival. This will enable the man-in-charge of Coachella to continue his homophobic actions. I do not believe Ariana should be at Pride if she is also enabling homophobic acts.
Hey dude love your stuff
There is a difference between being welcome at Pride as an ally to attend/protest or celebrate alongside us VS headlining the main stage at Pride (especially a Pride that costs money to attend). One is supporting and uplifting queer people, and the other is taking potential space from the community itself :/
BRENDON URIE!!!!!!!!
Id non-queer people come to pride, I exepct them to:
- Be respectful and understand that pride isn't about cishets, it's about their LGBTQIA+ relatives/friends
- Be supportive 
- And speak against homophobes/transphobes/biphobes etc
i think my main issue with this isn’t directed at ariana, its more the fact that cishet people are buying tickets BECAUSE of ariana; what's the probability that they would turn up to pride if she wasn’t performing??
 i'd rather they show support for queer people AT PRIDE than show support for someone they can see in concert another time. if cishet people are doing this, they're exploiting pride, our safe space and our celebration which isn't okay, and that's where i see a problem
Answer to title. No sorry 😂
As a straight person with lgbt+ friends and family I think it’s SUPER important to remember that pride is for people who are members of the community. But I really enjoy going to pride to support my friends and family and the whole community. A few years ago one of my friends came out a week before a pride festival in our city and she was TERRIFIED to go with our other lgbt+ friends. They were just so much more confident and they dressed up and everything. She asked me to go with her as support. I had never been before and I really wasn’t planning on going until she asked. We went together and honestly it was AMAZING. I loved seeing people so open and confident and proud. By the end of it my friend was a walking rainbow and she looked so happy and confident. I think straight people should see how much these festivals and parades help the shy members of the community. I’ve been every year since then and it’s a different and beautiful experience every time.
I love how you put this, I completely agree that a true ally is there for LGBT people all of the time. I don’t have a problem with people outside of the group coming to Pride, as long as they aren’t just coming for the party. I know people who aren’t LGBT, but will immediately stand up and speak out when they think something’s wrong, and they’re true allies. They belong at pride. People who are only coming for the party need to leave.

As far as Ariana Grande being there goes, I see why she’s going to be there, but I think Pride should be a time for LGBT artists to headline. I think it’s not right to give the headlines to people technically outside of the community, because it puts LGBT people to the side at their own event. There are many big LGBT artists out there who could make big headlines,  but the spotlight would still shine on the people who the event is for. I think people like Ariana can be there, but just not be the headline and staple of the event. :)
Thank you for reminding why I will never go to a pride festival. People making a big deal out of Ariana performing like she doesn't have a GAY brother.
I love your thoughts Tyler. I am straight but have a lot of gay friends. I agree that if people who are not part of the Pride community need to ask themselves why they are going and it doesn’t matter if they are headlining, everyone not part of the community that attends is a guest to the event and they really need to understand what being an ally means...I’m still working through this myself. it’s important for the Pride community to be embraced and accepted and I agree that Grande has shown up and deserves to be there!❤️
I know who should be at pride and my answer is obviously gonna be either Brendon urie and if this is at Manchester I’m gonna try and go and see it but college  allows no time for that
I think if queer month is about giving visibility and a voice to lgbtq+ people, you guys should have lgbtq+ artists performing. The alies should show that they are alies by not taking lgbtq+ artists space and chance to have a voice
Everyone in the comments be talking about pride and I'm just sitting here, thinking "man hitting the gym sure did Tyler good"
Can we talk about how we have to pay to go to pride?? I mean in the uk at Manchester we do like tf
Man if only Freddie Mercury was still alive because then I would be like he needs to headline. He’s honestly my biggest inspiration and it would have been amazing to see him preform at Pride.
FIRSTT?!
You can never have too much love and support. If you're at pride to spread love, uplift your LGBTQ+ friends, or to educate yourself on one of the many groups of people that fall under the larger umbrella, than you belong there. If you're there for any other reason...why?

Be honest, be fearless, be brilliant, but above all else be kind. And damn it spread that looooove♡♡♡
Idk I don't think ariana is the problem but the people she attracts are, ariana is great but I'm afraid a lot of people are going to see it as a concert/festival/party and not as a safe space/queer celebration.
WAS JUST ON YOUR LIVE ILYYYY
videos like this are!important!
I think pride is an event by queer people for the queer people, but allies and supporters are more than welcome. So Ariana is should be allowed to participate, as long as she doesn't forget what the purpose of the event is and doesn't make the rest of the presenters and performers her shadow.
The moment she crosses that line, she will be in a lot of trouble with the queer community.
* sees title *
It’s a no from me chief
a lot of people are queer and they have friends that aren't and they come to pride to be with their friends and be with the culture in a supportive way
Where did my soft little Tyler go :( lol
Tyler is sooooo gay 😂😂 love u ty😘😘😘😘😘😘
Oof boy am I early
My opinion is, yes. It's not her fault people aren't respectful of pride and they'll turn it into a "concert"
saying this before watching the whole video
If I was in america this would be my saving grace. 
I wouldn't have to be a 'lesbian' to attend, I could just really like Ariana Grande!
It just so happens I also really like Ariana Grande... 
and her music is cool too I guess.
My town is having it first pride and we are in England and it being run by the local college and gay bar in England and I am so happy to be part of the student  committee and we have people who are part of the lgbt+ and people who are straight and yet they support people like me and for me that is enough for me as if they can accept me and let me live my life the way I want it I am more then happy to welcome them to pride
Damn you are looking so muscular
Isn't everyone welcome at pride?
1. She's a queer icon 
2. Remember the Manchester bombing?
3. Im Right
whispers monopoly
School in Birmingham uk   LGBQT stuff going on there   Don’t see any LGBQT activists there   ??  Why is that  ?
In Manchester specifically I think Ariana Grande performing is great. She means A LOT to our community after everything that happened and I think she's going to make pride an even bigger event and that's wonderful! ❤️💛💚💙💜
I think that while it's, of course, very sad that prices will be high and lots of lgbtq+ identifying people might not be able to go because people are only going for Ariana, there is, in my opinion as a member of the community, nothing inherently wrong about it! 


Quite the contrary, I view it much the same as you suggested: maybe we could all benefit from more people being exposed to our communities and cultures! So often in everyday life, "cisgendered straight" people make it awkward for us (me) without meaning to – but at pride, they won't be able to do so, because it's OUR space. They are the ones who aren't the norm in this space – and if you ask me, they are so very welcome, but they play by OUR (reasonable and respectful) rules and they accept and integrate into our community and culture. 


But like I said, of course I understand that it's very sad for a lot of people who won't be able to go, but y'all, at least there's a big-ass pride. I come from a tiny place in Sweden and the pride "weekend" here is minimal – we're lucky if there are enough people for a parade. Be happy that people are there. Be happy that it's such a big thing that NO ONE in society can ignore, at least for its duration. Be happy that it's getting the attention it deserves.


There are fights we have to take, battles and riots that should be chosen, but in my opinion, this isn't one of them. We have more serious things to adress. Review your priorities.
I think everyone belongs at pride. It’s about accepting all sexualities. Also Ariana Grande is a huge supporter of LGBTQ. Especially since her older brother Frankie is gay.
Pride was never a Safe Space it was the exact opposite and I think the idea of there being designated safe spaces can lead to potentially dangerous consequences for minority or looked down upon groups. I think it can isolate these groups and make them seem less of a part of society and more of a segregated fringe group which is hostile to outside influences.
I think if we really want to be taken seriously we need to take more risks and come together with straight, cis, white, etc. people.
Though I do admit the corporatization of pride is terrible with the Minions and companies taking advantage of pride just to advertise to people.
Indeed. There's no problem with straight artists coming to pride but they need to be REAL allies and not support our community just that day.
The issue is that pride is now becoming an overpriced concert
I'm here from the anti gay video
We cannot celebrate pride and leave certain people out. Wouldn't that be paradox to the message we want to spread? Just a personal thought. 🙈
I don’t really know if I am LGBT or not, but let’s I am not but LGBT friendly, Do I belong to a gay pride even if I am not LGBTQ ? 🥺Cause I am really supportive to those people and I would like to go...
She deserves to be there more than the community allows someone who looks like me.
My issue is not with a straight/cis allies at Pride. It's the fact that big name artists like Ariana drive up the cost and make the event less or completely inaccessible to lower-class, low-income lgbtq+ people of all ages when Pride should be a fun, safe space for lgbtq+ people and respectful allies/family/friends. I think we need to reevaluate what Pride has become and what we want it to be...
To my family I’m “straight and cis” and they think that pride is a “gay” thing so they don’t allow me to go no matter how much I ask. So maybe if more “straight” allies join then my family will actually let me go. This is just a REALLY personal opinion but I see how it can be right and wrong from both sides
I completely agree. If Cher and Mariah Carey can come to pride, then Ari can come to pride. But she won’t be the only artist. Queer artists will be there as well. I believe that allies are welcome to pride💗💜💙
Love this discussion!!
I've been going to pride with my (straight) parent(s) since I was a tiny kid and I totally think non lgbt+ people can come BUT ariana has a huge straight following and I saw a lot of stuff about people JUST going for her and idk how to feel about that
somebody call harry styles please
Her brother...
Correct me if I'm wrong....Isn't Pride about inclusivity, acceptance, and love. I don't know who can give LGBT community more steam than like THE BIGGEST STAR OF THIS DECADE. For community that wants acceptance and inclusion, saying who can and who cant join the celebration is not only hypocritical, but also really wrong.
Ariana Grande SHOULD be able to headline pride as a big-ticket ally, but straight people should not buy tickets JUST to see Ariana Grande. If they come to celebrate queer people then that's fine.
I think it’s good for respectful cishets to go to pride. But I think it should mainly be in the company and support of their queer friends and family. Ie supportive parents of their queer children, friends going along with someone who is nervous to go. Someone who may not be out but wants to experience the queer community. The problem arises when cishet people take the spotlight from queer people. It’s in bad taste to take that spotlight from the people that the event is suppose to highlight. Now with the Ariana grande thing I think the problem is in part takin that spot light while also allowing the organizers to jack up prices because her name is attached. She is profiting off of the moniker of queerness more than supporting it.
I feel like the idea of keeping straight people out of pride is based on all queer people being out. What if we accidentally make a closeted person feel alienated by the lgbtq+ community when they are already probably feeling alienated by the straight community.
Quick question, where does that leave people who are curious or still in the closet?
No. It's should be an lgbt+ artist
Why not Brendon Urie instead of her?
Also she headlined or will be headlining Coachella which is homophobic and used queerness to sell so she's not a good ally....
I have the same birthday as you!😃
yooo what happened to his channel? he  hardly gets the amount of views that he used to
Er, no, that's a huge mistake. Pride should be headlined either by a LGBT performer or LGBT icon.
While I think you made a good case for allies at Pride, I don't think this really addresses why some people think Ariana shouldn't be there. Like...the reason why people don't think Raytheon (or other dangerous corporations) shouldn't be there isn't because some of their employees are straight. It's cause Raytheon is a weapons manufacturer that profits off of killing black and brown people (who both straight and lgbt+). I don't want Ariana in my space because she's a white woman who profits off of Black and Latinx culture and doing brownface. Intersectionality matters. The oppressors work together so I'm not about to want people in my community who aren't willing to work across struggles. If someone hurts the Black community, I frankly don't care if they want to support me as a queer person. Idk, maybe if she shows a  effort to learn/unlearn, then I'd be more ready to fight for her in my space. I haven't seen that yet, but maybe  I'm not looking in the right places.
hayley kiyoko, please.
Personally, I think straight allies are fine when it comes to being/performing at Pride since they're supporting LGBTQ+ people, but it'd be nice for more LGBTQ+ people/artists to headline an event about LGBTQ+ people, like Brendon Urie.
let lgbt performers take the stage! normally i wouldn’t complain but people having to pay to see a cishet celeb at pride doesn’t sit well with me. just respect the history of pride
Shouldn’t pride be for anyone celebrating the lgbtq+ community
Pride parades originally started of pride liberation marching in the 70s and 80s and slowly transformed into pride parades as we know them today. Tyler brings up interesting points that I’ve never thought of before but I still feel like pride, because of what it was before, should be for queer people. Allies are very important, don’t get me wrong but I feel like pride should be for queer people. It’s their time to embrace who they are and show the world they aren’t afraid to be themselves.
Literally don’t come to pride unless you are LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 OR you are an ally with true connections to the community
I think pride first and foremost is for the LGBTQAI+ community but that straight cis-people that have shown respect towards the community throughout the rest of the year also should be welcomed if they want too. So that they get an even bigger understanding and bigger respect for the community unless they know a LGBTQAI+ person personally.
great artist at the great event surrounded by great queer people
celebrating love and life
enjoying their time
what could possibly be wrong with that
Ariana was invited for two reasons:

1. Ariana has been a supporter and ambassador of Manchester since the attacks. It would make sense for her to show her support to Manchester.

2. Her brother is LGBT. She's an ally.

Quite simple. No controversy.
I know another issue with Ariana at pride is the fact that ticket prices rose, and queer people who wanted to go to Pride can't afford it :(
ariana grande will be at pride AND at coachella. Which is kind of ironic. But i mean tons of LGBTQ people keep supporting coachella anyway ....

and about ariana at pride - i live nowhere near the US, but it doesn’t feel right to me that people who are not LGBT+ and are not allies would come without a care in the world for what pride is, only to see and hear ariana perform. 

Maybe it would have been nice as a surprise (pretty unrealistic I guess but oh well)
I think that for general PRIDE festivals and stuff then allies should definitely be allowed; obviously in a perfect world LGBT+ -phobic people would be banned from it, but like Tyler said, that would be impossible to control. PRIDE is supposed to be about accepting yourself so I would say everyone there should be celebrating everyone else and/or themself accepting their own sexuality and gender identity, while also acknowledging others’ specific struggles with LGBT+ -phobic places and/or people. AKA: It shouldn’t be about feeling sorry for LGBT+ people as a whole, it should be about acknowledging individual LGBT+ people’s personal negative experiences regarding gender and/or sexuality.
poor guy, cant even get 100 k
Everybody forgets that her brother is frankie grande who is part of the LGBTQ community
We can't ban anti-LGBT people from LGBT pride. The pride parade in my town is always picketed by an anti-gay Church group and they have the right to be there in opposition.
Hey Tyler I don't know if you'll ever see this comment or even care but I've been a long time sub for 11years now and you've been such an inspiration for me over the year's and you gave me the confidence to be myself so thank you so much for that and you have grown so much yourself and I love seeing that. Well I wish you luck in you're future endeavors.
I’m glad she’s performing at Pride because not only is she an amazing artist but I know she supports the community and I hope she uses her platforms to support the LGBTQ+ community 🌈
I definitely agree “ The more the merrier” AG is one of the strongest allies known to the LGBTQ+ community. It’s not just concert, it’s her showing her support to the community she loves dearly.
Totally agree
i don't have any issue with ariana herself, but it was frustrating to see my high school peers go to pride and post about how they're having fun in rainbow colors posing with shirtless men, when at school, i faced difficulty in simply hosting a day of silence event. and this was in the bay area. so my issue is when pride's historical purpose and cultural ties are being forgotten and replaced with the capitalism and money that businesses, corporations, and organizations profit off of, which goes hand in hand with cishets to easily 'pretend' that they're allies.
I think there should be a day when the Allies come and then maybe just a day or hour when it’s just us talking and flirting and all that stuff without worrying that we’re talking to a straight or cis
Everyone that wants to share love and tolerance... Just be happy
Wow the most relavant way to celebrate my birthday
I want to see Brendon Urie or Queen lead a pride but at the same time I don't have an issue with Ariana. I just hope it doesn't pull any bigots into pride.
 If you support lgbtq+ people and want to come to pride please come!
If you're only coming to see Ariana shame on you and you better not be an issue at pride. Understand that if you aren't a supporter of lgbtq+ rights and show up just for Ari and make a huge fuss about what you see it will be an issue. 
Come if you're a supporter don't come if you aren't. It's that simple.
I understand why people don’t mind  Ariana Grande at Queer Pride, but I feel as if maybe someone in that community should preform with her. Maybe Brendon Urie ;) after all he is lbgtq+ and supports it and has supported for quite some time. Also the ticket prices went way up and I’m really upset about it, but Tyler you made some very good points.
Personally I don't think she or any straight ally should be the headliner at pride. Mostly because this brings up "pride is a music festival" stuff that I've been seeing around on the internet. Obviously they are welcome to go if they're going on their own and, like you said, they're not just there for pride itself. However, with the build up of people thinking pride is just a rainbow party, I don't think that there really should be ANY straight performers at pride. I'm not sure of who would go instead because I'll admit, I'm not the best at finding new music by queer people. I just don't think a straight person should be able to go to an lgbt+ event as a headliner because there are going to be a lot of people there just for the performance.
pride is FOR lgbt+ people but everyone as long as they recognize it's not FOR them. the problem with ariana is that the tickets for pride went way up in price when she was announced. she is also headlining coachella which DONATES to anti lgbt+ organizations and that really rubs me the wrong way.
I have always wanted to go to pride because I am a serious ally but I was never sure if I would be welcome because I am straight and I did not want to disrespect anyone in any community. If I was to go this year, Ariana wouldn’t even be the selling point for me. Just the closeness and the love that everyone seems to share would be what draws me.
literally just let whoever wants to come not that hard
Everything was well said Tyler, I personally think anyone is welcome at Pride and shouldn’t be limited on who can go and who can’t!
the only problem i have with ariana headlining pride is that i've literally seen homophobic people say they're only going for ariana. and, like you said, people want pride to be a safe place and i strongly agree with that, so a ton of homophobic people going there really ruins that. just knowing you could be judged or even attacked by someone in the place thats supposed to be your safe place can be so scary :(
Tbh rupaul should headline all prides
Honestly if they have been an active supporter in the LGBTQ+ community then yes, but it comes to a point where having very high up celebrities perform is just going to turn the whole pride event into a concert because their is going to be hundreds of fans who aren’t respective of our community who will go just so they can see these celebrities ( bristol pride 🇬🇧 ) we dont have really any big names headline our pride because we rarely have any celebrities come to bristol even on tours its usually london which is sad but as long as it has great vibes then im happy with whatever
You know, many artists in the music industry are LGBTQIA+ and in the closet through force/manipulation/choice.  So yeah, I don't think it's fair/right to be so against artists performing at pride.  Also, there are teams who will use pride events for their artist for promotional reasons.  Artists that are in the closet aren't usually allowed anywhere near pride events, even if they are major supporters of the LGBTQIA+ community.
When you said you're planning a bunch of pride stuff, I instantly imagined you in a corset and a tutu with a unicorn's horn and rainbow make up leading a panel on LGBTQ issues.  Too much?
Tbh Ariana is not the best paragon for an ally; whether it's for the LGBTQIA+ community, the Asian community ESPECIALLY,  and LatinX community.  There are better artists that like Tyler said, have been supportive of minorities and marginalized folks CONSISTENTLY
I believe cis straight people should be welcomed at pride not only because they are allies but also to allow closeted queer people that want to go to pride to go without outing themselves. As long as they are being respectful to others, everyone should be allowed to go to pride 🌈
I don't nessesarily have anything against Ariana comming to pride, but with all the LGBTQ+ artist that do exicist, why not have them headline? It is totally cool that she supports the LGBTQ+ community and I hope she will, as Tyler says, use her position to bring important matters to everyones attention to create a better world and future for everyone, that is inclusive towards any gender and sexuality 
- happy pride y'all !
First!
Isn't her brother gay tho? I'm sure it's prob important to her
I think it's quite silly to say "only queer people should be at pride" like would you like to test if someone is or isn't? I never believed in introducing myself with a label, I mean if you do that's totally fine but it's not thing. I believe there is a whole spectrum between 100% straight and 100% gay and I'm definitely not in any of those corners, throughout my life I've had crushes both on male and females, but I fell in love and started a relationship only once and it was a male I'm not marrying. So if you looked at me you would deny me access to pride, right? And I understand I'm not sharing the same struggle because of my sexuality as per say a 100% gay person, of course, I never try to pretend otherwise and I always loudly support LGBTQ members who are struggling, but isn't the whole pride about not judging people by the looks or whatever and letting everyone be who they are/want to be?
You make it sound like you're another race because you're gay like what the hell
I’m straight but I’d like to go to the pride someday just cuz I want to show my appreciation to lgbtq
I feel like pride is a place for everyone, ally's and queers. It's a time to celebrate what makes us unique from one another and what makes us individuals. Ari is a big supporter and I feel like her message of positivity is needed at pride!
Araina has a deep connect to Manchester. I belive she should be able to perform for the pride event she's stood with all of the people of Manchester before after a terror attack and now she's standing with the people of Manchester again to celebrate pride!
I belong at pride you belong at pride everyone belongs at pride :)
I think that anyone who is LGBT+ should go and anyone who supports the LGBT+ 🏳️‍🌈 community should also go even if they aren’t LGBT+, because then they could make some friends that are LGBT+ 🏳️‍🌈  and they can also have a good time
Remember that after the terrorist attacks in Manchester Ariana has a connection with the city and its people, queer and straight alike
I fully agree. Ariana has not only been supportive, she has been very outspoken ally. Ally's that do come to pride also need to know that they are a guest in the space. They must respect the artist and drag queens performing. Too many times I've seen supportive straight people acting a FOOL at drag shows or at gay bars.
Tyler me and some of my schools lgbtq+ club members who are also my friends just had a meeting with the principal to open the gender neutral bathrooms again also I'm super excited for pride month
I feel like everyone should be allowed at pride why are we excluding people?
Great points Tyler! I agree that allies who have fought alongside the LGBTQ+ community openly and used their platform for us are more than welcome at pride. 

In terms of whether I would welcome Ariana to my pride... I was kind of put off by the statement she released after people claimed that she was exploiting the LGBTQ+ community (ticket prices etc.). Idk. It all seemed very "hey queers i love you you're great fans but i have nothing to do with ticket prices" and seemed a little too low-effort, plus she barely acknowledged the main cause of the controversy - "stealing" the spotlight of many other LGBTQ+ artists. I stanned her (honestly who didn't) and was kind of disappointed because it felt like she was trying to glide over the issue by throwing compliments at the LGBTQ+ community rather than understand and make attempts at lowering the ticket prices, or even just take the opportunity to ask her fans/people going to the event to support the queer artists that are going to be there. Did you see Piers Morgan's post with her? Coz sis.... that hurteddt a lil lmao

But at the end of the day she has been there for the community in the past and I'm grateful for that. As long as she (for the lack of a better phrase) "stays in her lane" for now I'm fine with her headlining pride tbh.
Love ❤😘it
You hit the nail on the head with "but are you supporting queer artists?" to those criticizing Ariana Grande. I can't even with how many people on my social media who complained but won't take a second to share music we cover or put out.
I thought you'd bring up that her brother is gay in part of the defense of her obviously being a supporter, Also, I question if Gaga were to headline, would it be as big a deal? I think Ariana is a good choice (with great music as well).
i think it's okay to have straight artists performing at pride events, but maybe as a surprise guest? that way they still get to show their support, but the people attending aren't going solely for that artist.
You should provide your viewers with a brief history lesson on pride to better educate queer and non queer people !!
my issue isn’t that there will be straight people at pride because there’s ALWAYS straight people at pride and, for the most part, i love having them there!!! seeing allies actively supporting the lgbtq+ community is incredibly heartwarming. my issue is the 1) price of attending and 2) the non-allies that will be showing up just for the ari concert. pride is a safe space created by the lgbtq+ community FOR the lgbtq+ community and anyone who doesn’t support us doesn’t belong there. it’s as simple as that.
Homophobia at a pride event isn’t new. It’s simply ill to believe that it’s the ‘first time this is happening’. Every year protesters come to pride events weather they are for or against gay rights. This has always been the issue, and acting extreme about the situation doesn’t help a thing. The best we can do is just give off good positive energy. I want to hear everyone sing the lyrics to whatever artist that is playing. I want everyone to just be taken over in the moment with joy and kindness. Even though there are still places we are discriminated against strongly, we’ve made progress. We can get married in so many countries!! It’s not a lot, but a decade ago this wasn’t even possible in the states. Things will continue to get better, we just need to stay positive and push our fears out. We can drown out evil with love. <3
I do agree with that. As long as the allies that want perform with us use their platform to support us I’m all for it
First coment
ok but i really didn't like that she used lesbianism for shock value in buwygib
Well said!
This👏needed👏to👏be👏said👏
Our LGBT community needs our straight brothers and sisters. It is only when we recognize the importance of being loved and treated with respect as a community (LGBT), that enables our communities to thrive as a loving human race. We all want to be loved and we all want to love. 🇺🇸 🌈😎🤓🌈
Funny story, just yesterday at my GSA Club, we talked about stuff like this, and I said that we needed to learn about LGBTQ+ history in school. For both heterosexuals and everyone else. I learned about the Stonewall Riots because of you, and that's the only thing I know about our history, and that's not okay. We need to know this. If school can talk about the protests against segregation and sexism, then why can't we talk about the protests of LGBTQ+?
Ariana Grande is headlining Coachella as well, and the owner of that donates to anti LGBT organizations and everything, also I tried to explain the whole issue to  my (straight) mum and she completely didnt get it
I don’t care how much of an “ally” anyone is, straight people are turning pride into a show with straight people performing and at extremely high prices. They also will be selling pride flags and stuff that straight people will buy because “it looks cute”. They wanna capitalize the community in this time of “acceptance”
I agree with you! I think Pride is a celebration of the community and a chance to make our voices heard. If non-LGBTQ+ artists help strengthen our voices and our want for inclusion and unity, why exclude them from our events? I think this kind of integration is important.
of course you talk about ariana grande on my birthday
I think, it’s a parade for queer people, it’s a day for queer people, and it should be about queer people. Therefore, a queer person should perform. To me, it doesn’t make sense that the parade that we have, we’re going to have a straight person perform.
Thanks for the closed captions! ^^ So, my opinion is that everyone who wants to come, should. But as you ask, who is Pride for? I think it's for queer people as a centrum and for non-queer people as audience, since the history been rough to us. But at the same time, concerts in Pride-festivals should have queer artists as well, because it's probably, theorethically,  the safest place they can be atm when they perform and give most impact and gain fans.
Beyoncé is
the real pride queen
let’s celebrate her
I do get why LGBT+ pride is a thing (i’m part of it don’t worry) but she’s there to show love, it’s not her fault if straight people come along to watch her- but it something that comes with it.

It is about safety and acceptance, definitely, but straight people can too attend to show their support to those who are LGBT+, the only problem would be phobic people who don’t deserve to be there
ty this is a good take
Didn’t Ariana come out as Bi a few years ago?
Yes she does belong
I don't mind allies coming to pride, what I don't like about Ariana headlining pride is that she blatantly queer baits in the break up with your girlfriend, I'm bored video and that bothers me because she knows how much of her fanbase is lgbtq+ and yet she made the choice to queer bait in the video and I don't think that's okay. especially when there are other "bigger" artists that ARE lgbtq+ that aren't being invited to headline like Halsey, Brendon Urie from P!ATD, and Hayley Kiyoko.
I’ve never been to pride because there usually isn’t one close to me but this video definitely educated me as an ally and made me want to DESERVE to one day celebrate with y’all! JS. As always, thank you, queen!
That one tweet about not wanting police there was absolutely ridiculous. Who do you think is going to provide security?! Who do you think is going to be there in case there's a (God forbid) emergency?! The freaking police!
I know it is off the topic but I am a little bit missing the Disney challenge
Tyler, you liked a tweet that called critics of Ariana at pride ‘glue sniffers’. I was highly disappointed to see this from you, the criticism was ABSOLUTELY valid and no person in the community should be dismissed. Pride should not become a mere party for cishet people, its a protest, and began as a riot. Just because lgbt rep is more common for you as a cis white gay man doesnt mean everyone in the community sees themselves and therefore giving the stage to a cishet white woman and pushing prices up to £70 (excl. poor lgbt ppl) is, imo, not acceptable. Regardless of your belief, dismissing the valid criticism of the most marginalised in our community is wrong.
Y'all call nongay artist get gay icons so... Tf like why we call Cher and lady gaga gay icons but not Ariana.. Y'all wanna be woke whenever y'all want
The problem is that they’re turning pride into a music festival, not a protest, which it always has and always will be. Pride is no longer a safe space for lgbt people when you have homophobes going to pride just to see Ariana Grande. And yes, that’s happening. I have friends who have personally heard their homophobic classmates say they’re going to pride to see Ariana. I’m not mad at her, because she more than likely doesn’t understand why this is wrong, but it IS wrong. 
Another thing: Pride should be accessible. I get there being room for allies, but when you have people who are lgbt unable to go because they can’t afford it, while straight people who have the money get to, that’s a problem. Pride is for lgbt people first and foremost. It’s  space.
Bring Harry styles to pride.
If anyone trys to tell me that Ariana doesnt support the LGBTQ+ community im gonna be throwing fists
I go to a pride parade every July to support my Trans sister, and I support everyone as well, because people are people man, it doesn't matter if they are different! 😁😁👍
The issue with having any of these huge huge artists is that it makes pride inaccessible. Firstly and most obviously,  there now has to be tickets, and they are EXPENSIVE. Queer people should not have to be excluded from that safe space (which may be their ONLY safe space) because they cannot afford it. It's so wrong and unfair, for example take a young queer 15 year old who has never found a community they fit into, and they physically cannot attend pride because they can't pay for the ticket themselves and their parents sure as hell ain't gonna pay for it. What else can they do? They shouldn't be excluded from finding themselves and their community. Secondly, people come to pride for the *wrong reasons*. You should be coming to pride to participate in a protest/celebration for LGBT rights in your community, not to see certain artists. And it is undeniable - there will be some people who come to Manchester pride solely to see Ariana because they couldn't get tickets on her world tour, and arent allies of the LGBTQ community themselves. 

Im not mad at anyone here and I definitely agree there's places for everyone at pride - queer and straight. But my issue lies with how big the artist is, and how that affects the accessibility of the pride for the members of the underprivileged community themselves, and how it affects the message/reasons for people attending.
i don’t think people know that most of ariana’s fandom is actually very supportive of lgbtq+ because a lot of them are lgbtq+ so i think many people are thinking there will be a ton of antis but i believe it’ll be few antis and definitely not enough to overall ruin the spirit of the event. ariana has danced with pride flags at her own concerts and her brother is openly gay and a line in “no tears left to cry” is dedicated to her queer fans and she loves them with all of her heart. she is a great ally to have. i agree with you tyler ♡
i love an ally, though i find it so hard to trust allies as they often falter...obviously cuz theyre not perfect. But allies also tend to hang their allyship over the community's head and threaten to stop showing support if there is ever any conflict which is like yikes. Not talking about Ariana just saying it does happen a LOT.
I don't think the controversy was really Ariana going to pride. I think she's an awesome ally. The problem was not that, it was that it's now going to be a concert and it will cost a lot to enter. Many queer people won't be able to go to pride now, even if they didn't care to see Ariana. Also now many people who are not really allies will now go just to see Ari and not really care to support the community at all.
HAYLEY KIYOKO SHOULD HEADLINE PRIDE
The ticket prices is the worst part. She says she has no say on that but she does. Say she won't perform if they charge! It is turning it into a concert. Also it's not that she doesn't belong to be there but I personally don't think she would headline because that's different than being an ally just being there.
LOVE IT
Cough hayley kiyoko cough
Also people in the LGBTQ+ community aren't all gay. Stealth straight trans people exist and assumeing they are straight and cis can hurt them. Just keep that in mind when an assumed straight cis couple is enjoying pride. Also tor or both could be bi or nonbinary or pan or ace. Just people, stop getting uoset when you don't know eveyones back story at pride. Thank you.
I have a question...... 
do you think that asexuals are part of the LGBTQ+ community? 
I have heard mixed reviews. 
Want some opinions from y’all.
oooo cant wait
WHY did you private or delete all of your 5 AWESOME GAY videos?
my biggest thing is that she is still headlining for coachella with a known homophobic history. she's honestly big enough to go while I'm honored you invited me our views don't align so im going to decline. she would set a huge presadent for this stuff
I think anyone who supports lgbt should be at pride if they really want to.
I’m gay and the more videos I watch the more I realize how much I don’t know about LGBTQ history. Anyone know any good books or material to learn from!?
pride to me is about being your true self in a world where you are judged for it, for me meaning being bisexual and being brave enough to love myself. if ariana wants and is asked to headline and she is an ally i think she is allowed to do that. maybe i'm just a reallly open person and if people don't hurt each other mentally or physically,, just do whatever you want. don't be an asshead, respect yourself, don't do stuff you know you can get caught and get serious problems for and live your life.
I agree
No she’s a culture vulture
This guy is still relevant?
QUEER NECCESSACITIES!!!!
I love gays. Periodt.
My biggest problem is that the tickets costs 70(!) Pounds! This way every single (especially closeted) teenager and a lot of probably young adults are excluded simply bc of money issues. So maybe better have a less famous headliner who is cheaper (bc people like Ariana need more security and stuff.) Or a famous one who does their part for free at least!
I realize this discussion stems mostly from Ariana Grande but I want to point out that in there crowd I think there may be people who are still closeted, who are curious to learn more about pride, and who come to pride to learn about the community. I think it’s important to include them. Maybe they are passing as Hetero or cis but maybe it’s out of necessity and so pride would be their chance to crack the door to see what’s on the other side.
I was understanding that people have an issue with her being at Manchester Pride because she is making people essentially pay to go to Pride. Which is not good, and that’s what I am mad about. I don’t care who headlines at Pride so long as they are respectful and not transphobic and/or homophobic and don’t make people pay to go to a free event
No one does. As it shouldn’t be a thing. It should be banned
I'm straight but I really want take my queer friend as her parents are homophobic and I want to show her how there are many other people perhaps going through the same thing or feel the same way as she does and that it's ok. I don't know if I would feel out of place at Pride and I certainly wouldn't want to use this monumental event as a party.
As a bisexual person, I don't really feel like I can go to pride (which is why I have never gone) because it seems very much about people who are either "L" or "G" but not "B", "T", "Q" or +.    I have been assured I am wrong but the amount of biphobia I have seen from the LGBTQ+ community makes me not believe I am welcome in really any LGBTQ+ space.
Loove u Bae
I have absolutely no problem with Ariana performing and headlining Pride, I have more of a problem with the fact that people are making it into a music festival where non-allies are buying tickets for the sole purpose of seeing people like Ariana. I love the fact that allies go to Pride to support their queer friends and acquaintances but because people are trying to profit off of the event itself in a way that isn’t really supporting LGBTQ+ people. I definitely agree with everything you said about Pride and who is and isn’t allowed, I just think it’s a bigger conversation that isn’t limited to the people who perform at and attend Pride, but rather who’s going to be profiting off of the event.
Some people are saying Ariana grande might have come out as bisexual with her new song monopoly, with the line "I like women and men"
i feel like the one point most people are forgetting is the fact it is manchester and obviously ariana’s concert was attacked there, and in manchester she means a lot to people who were there at night or just mancunians in general. i’m straight but have always been an ally and obviously i know that it isn’t my place to say who should be at pride but i feel like it’s one of the main reasons she’s been invited (and to support her LGBTQ+ fans but that’s a given)
I think Ariana isn't the right person to be a headliner. She could perform with a queer performer, but as a solo it's just doesn't seem right. I think she's just doing it for the attention. I don't think she has any real ties to the event. I think this event should be queer focused with maybe a few supporters in the mix, but the focus (of those who perform) is appreciating those who are queer in the industry and are fighting to be seen as performers.
I mean gays would say Britney belongs to pride so why not Ariana??
👏clap 👏back
Lol wtf. Shes a strong supporter. No duh.
Dying channel
I think pride is for the lgbtq+ community and allies. I personally think those who discriminate cis straight allies are just as bad as cis straight nonallies that’s just my opinion. Like Tyler said Ariana has showed endless support toward her brother and the community as a whole. She is a great pick for a headliner. I’m bi by the way hiiii. 💗💜💙🏳️‍🌈
Pride is for everyone
This is a very good video
The outflux of where moreso allies are asked to preform at pride more than actual LGBT Artist is very telling and a discussion needs to be sought in regards to that... Regardless of if they're a genuine ally or not pride month is for us by us and even when shit is made for us by us were still not the center of attention in the vain of being at the forefront.. is it internalized homophobia from our community? Is it a want to conform or assimilate to hetrosexual culture? Maybe appease are straight counterpart perhaps? Idk but I find it to be bullshit.  Like why is it that I've went to pride 6 years straight in my hometown and in that it's always been a straight ally Peforming but never and actual LGBT Artist or at least there never the main event.. in all 6 years.... I find this consistently happening to be problematic as it drives home a message that even in our own spaces we'd rather have a non LGBT person be at the forefront than someone within are community!  it was made for us by us so therefore have people that are us headline PERIOD!! the fact that often more than not you have allies rather than LGBT artist themselves headline pride is so consistent I fine to be an issue tbh  while I appreciate and value ate allies this narrative is still a major issue regardless
I think that everyone should be welcome at pride, as a queer person myself, it's really uplifting to see people celebrating queerness, and making us feel welcome and accepted. Sure some straight people are ignorant to why it happens and just want to have a piss up with some glitter on and shout yaas queen at everyone, but as long as people aren't being destructive or negative then they should be welcomed.
I guess I have to educate myself more as an ally. Never been to pride, I don’t feel like I should be there, it’s a thing for tje lgbtq+ community, not me. I’ve been invited to go, I have friends that are gay, trans, bi etc. and I want to support them, and I do, outside of the party. The party is for you guys, so have fun! Be proud! Still have to read up on it tho. Thank you Tyler for telling me this.
I LOVE YOU TYLER !!!!!!
This is not your pride. It is Manchester Pride. Ariana is an honorary mancunian due to her incredible display of support with One Love Manchester. Educate yourself before you claim this event is yours, it belongs to the people of Manchester who will forever share a bond with Ariana.
I don’t mind allies preforming at pride but ultimately I find the issue is the raise in price to accommodate these artists as well as the separate issue of age restrictions pushing out lgbt youth & poor lgbt.
Pride is for everyone.
The LGBTQ+ community doesn’t have a problem Ariana headlining Manchester Pride as she is an avid ally, the problem is there will be people who will only go to Pride because they want to see Ariana perform. That ruins the experience for the LGBTQ+ community who Pride is meant for. It sucks though because those people who just want to see a performance, they are truly missing the point on why Ariana is headlining a Pride festival in the first place.
I am straight and I support everyone that wants to be who they want to be.
Does anyone still watch this channel? All his thumbnails make me want to take a nap.
its not a point of if these people should or should not come to pride; its a matter of her headlining, or any ally headlining. pride is about lgbt people and as such the focus should be on us. of course allys are welcome and invited but the fact that shes headlining when there are a lot of lgbt artists who could do it is the main problem. the focus shouldn't be a straight person
What difference does it make if your gay. ?? I’m not proud to be heterosexual ,, I just am  also I’m getting a bit pissed off being told I should “ celebrate “ stuff  ??  I’ll do birthdays , Christmas ect  but who in they’re right mind wakes up in the morning and thinks    Wow , let’s have a bloody diversity or multi bloody cultural celebration today  we’re all equal   I sometimes think being equal is the last thing you want
It’s Manchester, right? Has everyone forgotten the attacks last year? Grande is MORE than deserving of that event.
The whole underlying message of Pride is inclusion and equal rights for all, and while I am a 43 year old bisexual woman in a monogamous marriage to a man, I firmly believe that ALL should be welcome at Pride. If not, aren't we spreading the same message that we're so desperately trying to eliminate? If we begin to exclude people based on their sexual preferences, then it seems as if we're mirroring the same narrow minded, exclusionary behavior that we have tirelessly worked to change. There are so many straight cisgender people who have been champions for the LGBTQ community and whose efforts have helped to change people's minds, outdated perceptions, and even laws that put a thumb directly on top of this community. In my opinion, I feel that it is imperative to really lean into & enforce the WHOLE message of Pride, which is that all people are beautiful and welcome regardless of age, color, religion, sexual orientation/identity, gender/gender identity, and all the other labels that serve to divide and pigeonhole people into neat little boxes so that OTHERS can define them in THEIR minds. It's 2019, the time has come to accept all, to love all, to welcome all just how they are. Of course that's just my opinion, lol.
didn’t ariana grande sileneyly come out  as bisexual in some of her new sons such as ‘break up with your girlfriend’ and ‘in my head’, even though she hasn’t outright come out because she doesn’t choose to label herself?
Wooooppsssss she came out as bi : )
YES
I love your sexy white neck.......xd !
The biggest problem with Ariana headlining at pride is that she’s also headlining at Coachella this year, which is run by someone who donates to anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The fact that she is performing as a main attraction at both within months of each other just seems a bit wrong.
When did he get ripped tho?
I’m so excited for pride month this year! I came out last July so I couldn’t really go to any pride, but I might be able to persuade my mom to let me go with a couple friends this year!! 🏳️‍🌈
Ariana Grande is not an ally, at the very least she isn't a good one.
As someone who isn't queer but is as much as an ally as I can be with homophobic parents, I really like the ideas of me being welcomed at pride. This is the same I would expect for Ariana. My dear rn is that people who are queer and want to attend pride bc it's pride won't be able to get in because people who aren't allys have bought tickets for Ari. That's all, have a lovely day
I mean she really just stated “I like women and men”, but just doesn’t want to be labeled soooooooooooooo(her best friend, Victoria Monèt commented on a post that stated “IS ARI BI??” And she commented “she said what she said”)
Last year I went to pride with my best friend and his boyfriend. They brought some friends, one of them started telling me that I didn't belong there, because I was straight, but he will "allow it, because my shirt makes me look like a lesbian". I was absolutely flabberghasted. I had never even heard of someone not wanting straight people there, when they just want to support their friends. Also what Kind of comment is that, a Shirt making someone "look like a lesbian"?!
Idk I’m gay and never been to pride and don’t care so seems to me to be an issue that isn’t mine but my opinion is telling me that anytime a big celeb stands up and attends pride it’s nice Bcz it’s also for allies
Just adding a point here: there are some places in the world where people will face anything from backlash to incarceration for even being an ally and voicing their support for us. When extremely famous people are at the forefront  people who are unsure on the issues will be swayed to our side imo. A lot of young people in my country in the middle east (quite honestly one of the most violent countries in the world towards our community) love Ariana, and seeing her do something like this might help raise a generation of more tolerant accepting people in countries like mine, because they see their idols doing so and they will understand that you don't have to be queer to support queer people. It's the sad side of being any kind of minority honestly, people from the other side are more willing to listen and accept someone who they believe isn't acting for their own self-interest or something.
Sexuality and gender are not binary and also not fixed. All this talk about being on this side or that side. Or being valid enough to be part of a certain community. People exist on a spectrum and also it’s fluid throughout time. Someone may identify as straight one year, and bi the next. Should they have been excluded from LGBTQ+ community the first year and welcomed the next?
Ariana Grande had a huge bump earlier this year, so I think people who were enraged back then, myself included, think it's better for her to sit this one out, and people just exploded through the dam. Also, I think the way she tried to handle this by responding on twitter was not the best way she could've have. She was a lot worse with the tattoo thing, but her sitting this one out might have been better in my personal opinion. (In NO WAY straight people can't headline, I'm just saying she needs to know when to back off for a bit if she's having more than a small splash in her pond)
While I have heard that Ariana Grande is very outspoken with her feminism I have not heard of her being intersectional or very outspoken about gay or trans or anyone's rights except women. I think I love that she wants to support the LGBTQ community but think it  is a missed opportunity to uplift and showcase how talented and wonderful the people of the LGBTQ community are.
Simply an opinion: There is certainly a place for allies in pride! Showing your support for family or friends who have passed or are with you is a beautiful thing. The issue I feel most people have with this is that Ariana has used transphobic and homophobic themes (which I've only heard and never seen myself? So if you have the link for how this started or something disputing it feel free to hmu) in her music. As well as the fact that Ariana's fan base is so huge that it's already apparent that the boom for this pride is ONLY because of this being a "concert" rather than a protest. I've also seen anger at the fact that prices to get IN are skyrocketed because of this performance. It's pride. It shouldn't cost anything to celebrate your identity with others like you and those who support you
Love you
i was invited by a lgbt friend to go to pride before i even thought about my sexuality too much, and i never tried to make it about me and how i was straight. i just went and supported everyone there. yeah straight ppl can go, as long as they know it's not about them lol
Amen
My straight sister went to pride (before I came out) with her non straight friends, I think as long as you say that your an ally and are respectful n stuff it's fine. If your gunna be horrible n stuff and only wanna come cuz its fun,  and you want a 'gay best friend ' dont even bother.  (Idk if that made sense but I hope it did)
I’m attending Manchester pride this year, and am getting mixed comments from people I know or people on social media saying I shouldn’t be there because I am straight! However I have been there to support my friends and the lgbtq+ community for as long as I can remember I fully support the lgbtq+ community and always will, yes I’m an Ariana fan and I won’t deny I am excited to see her there but I’m going with my friends to support and celebrate them, and everyone else :) x
why do people pay for pride?
Her brother is literally gay... that’s why she’s doing it, she’s already said this?
“Who belongs at pride?” anyone that wants to go and support LGBT.
Queer artists should be headlining Pride. Period. That's how we support our own. Putting some straight singer as the headliner goes against the spirit of Pride. She's only there for $$$, with grotesque ticket prices (which is not inclusive of poor queer people). I'm tired of straight people being elevated this way. And a REAL ally wouldn't be a part of that, they would know better.
prophet muhammed (P.B.U.H) will headline pride next. He will ensure to talk about all the verses in the quran where it mentions the lgbtq community.
SHE SHOULD NOT BE A PRIDE
I love Ariana Grande and I think allies should be allowed at pride, however I don’t think Ariana is the biggest ally and there are more supportive people idk
My issue isn’t with ariana specifically it’s the fact that a lot of straight people showing up are showing up specifically for Ariana and not because they’re truly allies, like you said. Also, the fact that she’s headlining has driven ticket prices up so much that a lot of queer people can’t afford to go and are getting pushed out of a space that’s supposed to be for them. Thank you so much for this video though, it definitely isn’t as black and white as people make it out to be
First
First
Ari's brother is gay
Ariana should be allowed because the attack at her concert was at Manchester, so it would be a nice sort of way to take back the night, and for those of you who say she isn't a part of the LGBTQ+ community are wrong because she IS, she is a straight woman but also an ally. The A in our community stands for Asexual AND Ally, Ariana has shown to care for the queer community numerous times. How can we expect the world to accept us is we put so much energy in protesting against things like this that don't matter, we have to use our voice to fight the REAL enemy
Inclusiveness plz
I know a lot of people are talking about the Ariana thing because they think lots of people will go just because of her (which is probably true) but I do think a lot of LGBTQ+ people feel weird about straight people being at pride. My thoughts on this are that pride is a celebration about queer acceptance and if you want to not accept people there because they aren’t queer you’re inflicting the same discrimination the festival is about overcoming. I think it’s important to have straight allies there, it shouldn’t be a queer exclusive event.
im gonna need some actual proof of ariana grande being a good ally. not having any "mishaps" (im assuming he means she hasnt said anything homophobic on the record) does not a good ally make. I mean, she hasnt proven herself to be a very good ally to POC in recent memory, and that raises concerns for me, tbh. Also, if there are limited tickets to pride, and straight people are only reserving tickets to go see ariana sing well then theyre not interested in pride, because they wouldnt have come if she werent headlining. I wouldn't want those kinds of people squeezing me out of my local pride parade if I lived in Manchester.
People really out here saying that homophobes will show up bc it's a mainstream straight artist. Lmao are yall zumb... homophobes won't go near gays, especially at pride for nobody. Delusional.
LY Tyler❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
She has a gay brother.... she’s an alley which mean she should be part of the pride
I don't mind it as much because it's not a Pride event I'm going to, but I get the feeling a lot of people will go because it's ariana grande rather than because they want to show that they are allies to LGBT+ folk
Ok Ariana isn't Madonna or Lady GaGa but I feel like if she supports the queer people then the prices of her concert should be lower for EVERYONE.  Hey they will still pay AG for doing her thing then she should take a pay cut for attending a Queer event.   Just my queer option all??
Pride is for everybody who is part of it or supports us.
Brendon Urie should be in pride he has supported for such a long time hell he won an award for the LGBTQ+ and he is Pansexual  yet he doesn't get to be there and perform. He legit cried when he found out that marriage equality he couldn't be anymore happier .
pride is about acceptance, no matter who you are, lgbtq+ people coming together alongside allies. but i fully agree that ariana grande doesn’t show support throughout the rest of the year. and the ticket prices, omg no! don’t make pride about making money!! make pride about human beings living and loving freely.
There are space for allies but  pride is for queer acceptance and there are lots of queer singers that can headline pride
I thought I was straight, and I commented on your last video, but in the last little while I've been questioning that and thinking about it and dwelling on it until I came to the conclusion that I think I'm polysexual and non-binary. I know I'm going to have to come out to my family at some point, and that thought terrifies me, cause I don't know if they will accept me, send me out of the house, I have no idea what they'll do. Do you have anything that could help me come up with a way to come out to them without them judging me or kicking me out of the house?
I think, on a day like Pride, it would be incredible to have an artist like Ariana Grande coming to perform. Especially, like some of those tweets said, that straight people will buy Pride tickets to see her. It’s good to get exposure of the LGBTQ+ community to people who wouldn’t normally attend Pride.
♥️Ariana Grande 👑🏳️‍🌈
Anyone who supports LGBT should be allowed at pride end of story
I can't believe this is even a discussion. Gay people make up to five percent of population and without streight people, we can do nothing. Excluding anybody from it will, at the end, just create more problems, more separation, that is the way gay people become "other". Remember,  to be included in society we have to include society. Sometimes it will not be  great, sometimes it will be scary and "dangerous" but it is the only way to move on in the future without any bullshit. Being gay does not makes us special, or magical or in general better than anybody else. However being gay can make us lose our heads, literally and legally, in a lot of countries in the world. One streight girl like Ariana Grande is more likely to change someones mind about it than most of the queer artists, just because of the masive following she has. 😁 😁 😁
I'm totally here for Ariana performing but headlining?? First off, such a big-ticket artist jacks up the rates wayy higher than they should be. And on top of that it's kind of up to organizers to make Queer voices heard first and foremost, so a cishet artist headlining isn't the best image. Allies are welcome! Come, and bring your friends! But don't steal our voices and our platforms.
Almost pride month? It’s 3 months away
Hey sexy
I’ve always wanted to go to pride because I’m a HUGE supporter of the LGBTQ+ community and always have but I’m straight and I feel SO BAD FOR GOING I DONT BELONG THERE but anyways if I ever do go it’s because I’m my pan friends’ ride 👍
Please rephrase your freaking title. BELONG? WTF do you mean? Your title has an accusative tone as if her appearance in Pride alone is already negative. I believe you knew the real issue here which is whether or not Ariana being a lead performer for pride is politically correct. But, your title says otherwise and sounds very divisive. Anyone who supports LGBTQ+ belongs in Pride and I believe Ariana is undoubtedly an ally although I also dislike the organizer's decision for making her the lead performer instead of real queer performer.
The answer is no. Im sorry but she doesn't know the struggles of being lgbt+?  No she doesn't. Its great that's she's a supporter and she love her brother who is openly gay. But I don't think she should be the headliner. I understand her performing but headlining????  Its a bit much.
The issue here in Manchester has been the alleged £250K fee that she is receiving. She is an ally and year-long allies are welcome, but the fee has caused bad feeling and a backlash.  There is even an alternative Manchester Proud event being organised in protest at the extreme commercialization of the event.  Manchester Pride, a charity in the UK, gave £161,000 in 2018 back to the community that it is constituted legally to serve.  People feel that something has gone badly wrong when the lead artists fee alone is nearly £90,000 more than is being donated to charity at the end of something that is meant to be a charitable event and uses that goodwill to generate audiences and income.
Honestly, I don’t think Ariana Grande should be performing at pride. Her performing has just turned pride into a concert. Tickets are expensive, which has made pride an exclusive event for only those who can afford it, and A LOT of people are just going to pride to see her. Hell, I know some homophobic people who are going just so they can see her. I really don’t believe Ariana should perform instead of other queer artists, of which there are many, and there’s no proof that any of them were asked at all. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying she just shouldn’t be there at all, but there’s definitely more appropriate people that could be going instead.
On the flip side, anyone that wants to go to pride should be able to, regardless of if they’re queer or not. I, for one, always appreciate allies. But just, don’t speak for queer people, just support them 🙌
In my country it's illegal to be queer. And every June I'm basically glued to the TV watching each and every Pride. As an outsider who's never been to a pride and knows the history behind it, I think if there are queer artists around which there are you should use them instead of straight artists. Pride is a celebration of LGBTQ community, so the people who perform in it should fall into that category. Why headline a straight artist when there are so many queer artists around that needs to be lifted up or celebrated? The talks around Pride month should be about why pride happened, how can we help those who need it, what's next going forward, etc; not about straight prople. The WHOLE point of the Pride month is to start a conversation on LGBTQ, you have the rest of 11 months to talk about straight people. As a closeted lesbian who is illegal to even exist in her own country, I wanna see actual talks happening all around the world. Why is nobody raising awareness about homophobic countries? Why is no one doing anything? You as outsiders who have the freedom of speech and are "celebrating" LGBTQ community, why aren't you helping us celebrate it as well? Instead all you care about is a straight artist who's just getting more famous by all these talks. Isn't Pride month about helping the community, so can you ACTUALLY start helping please?
Sooo Ariana’s brother is open and out, and it’s very clear that she loves him and supports him 100000 percent. And he loves and supports her. So it’s easy to see that she is a strong ally. I get that she herself is not lgbt+, but she’s still involved with the culture and obviously supportive.
I say the more the merrier. If you are there to love and support then why the heck not. Family’s that have loved and supported, friends that have love and supported and perfect strangers that have used theirs voices and hearts to support are all welcome. It’s Pride not private. It’s not about who you love, it’s how you use your heart. Not to mention  that not everyone is “out” and not everyone has a clear definition of their sexuality.
ALL👏IES!!!
Obviously allies/straight people should be allowed to both attened and perform. But the thing is, the event should be used to put lgbt+ artists and fans in the spotlight. Ariana performing is great, and shes a wonderful supporter of the community, but her headlining it is just NOT right.
I mean, Britney Spears headline Brighton pride last year and I didn’t see everyone freaking out so why are people so hurt over Ariana? X
Lol Ariana's queerbaiting in "break up with your boyfriend, I'm bored" music vid has me like nah
Doesn’t Ariana have a kinda transphobic music video?
(I say this as a cis straight person, for whatever that’s worth 😛) The only reason I can see for not having someone like Ariana grande is... if there is any chance that a queer person in  Manchester may think “I don’t wanna go cause I’m scared homophobes are going just to see her, and therefore pride may not be safe for me”....  then it’s not worth it to have her there, despite all the fantastic points Tyler made in favor
everyone belongs at pride... it’s a celebration for anyone who wants to support us! Don’t exclude people!
I’m not trying to take away from the importance of this video, but your arms are distracting. Your hard working is showing!
Who likes Arianna Grande and hates queers?
I’m straight and I haven’t had much interaction with you guys but yet again I don’t think of you guys differently. I just don’t know many people like you guys and I typically don’t really think about people differently I generally love everyone.
👏Brendon👏 Urie 👏for👏pride👏
The comments i read just scream no straights only gays....yeah who is segregating  now?
Imo as a bisexual, black male, I have felt excluded from the lgbtq+ community countless, COUNTLESS times. All this “Heteros can’t go to pride” to me is just another moment where people of lgbt that scream about acceptance and all that, are going to continue to separate and exclude themselves. I ask the question as how are heteros and anyone else wanting to see what pride is, how special it is to the community and everything that comes along with it, if those in the community won’t give them the chance. Those that are huge allies and advocates will now feel unwelcomed and to me that’s simply bullshit. Just my opinion
You know who I want to be at Pride? Myself😁unfortunately I have no way to get to LA and I’m still closeted👍🏻😭😭ugh my life sucks
Omg. Ariana Grande is a gay icon. I can’t believe this is even up for debate. We need to be inclusive. Allies are a huge reason to why the LGBTQ community has gotten this far.
She’s no Lady Gaga but she’s good and supports the gays. Let’s give her a chance
BTS!!!!
Straight people should be there to support! The whole point is to make LGBT people more accepted in society so pushing straight people out is kinda against that and separating everyone. The whole point is to become united don’t you think?
Ariana grande was openly transphobic in her music video (thank u next). She should definitely not be at pride.
..why do you only have 5.5k likes?...
Another people group (who, if they’re trying to come to pride, are probably allies) that should ALWAYS be welcome at pride are the family members of LGBTQ+ people.
Why can’t this month be a celebration of your sexuality no matter what your sexually attracted to? I feel as though this shouldn’t be an exclusive event for just LGBT, it should be a celebration of all sexual affiliations!
the problem isn’t that it’s ariana, it’s that she raised the price of tickets & now all the rich homophobes will buy up all the tickets & lgbt+ people (who are generally less rich) won’t be able to go. allies attending is fine but NOT when they’re taking up lgbt+ people’s space.
My problem isn't with Ariana coming to pride; it's in the 100$ tickets to pride that will stop queers from attending their own event. It's not her event, it's certainly not her fans' event, it's a parade to celebrate and share identity and the struggles we face because of that identity as well as a protest in the face of increasing anti-lgbt+ sentiment in recent time. Allies are free to attend pride as they please but homophobic pricks who only want to see Ariana are not and I know for a fact that some will show for that reason. Ariana can come if she wants to come but it shouldn't stop actual members of the community from attending or feeling safe.
Hayley Kiyoko and Brendon Urie would have been bomb. Also the price for pride in pounds is 71 but converted to dollars it's 94 ! Hell no. It's supposed to be a space for people of all ages and wealth, predominantly queer people and ACTUAL allies. Not ones who only show up for pride once to see Ariana. Also everyone has a different experience and I love ari's music but I just don't feel like she has done anything to directly effect how comfortable I am with my sexuality. Just because you support gay people doesn't mean you have to headline, especially without the permission of queer people living IN Manchester.
My issue is that she is headlining both Pride and Coachella. How can she claim to support the LGBTQ+ community when she has chosen to participate in a music festival whose founder, Philip Anschutz, actively donates large sums of money to anti-lgbtq campaigns???
First world problem!!! Pride month or pride parade or pride whatever is dumb.
Then y’all buyyyyyyy lgbtq musicccccc or just shut up
I think pride is for everyone who’s a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. Arianna grandes older brother is gay so I definitely believe she’s a part of that community and supports it
I agree, Tyler. If they support us throughout the year, which Ariana never hasn’t in any respects, they’re more than welcome. If we start shutting people out, we’re no better. You cannot end homophobia, misogyny, racism, etc with their inverses. Gays who are heterophobic, even bottom-phobic are also on the wrong side of history. I’m ranting now haha. But yes, Ariana Grande you are welcome with the Gays. You already know! 💜
I can't see allies who are Ari fans being homophobic. So I don't see an issue with Ariana being there. It'll probably going to bring more similar people like us.
I don’t know because I don’t like how she queer baited at the end of the break up with your boyfriend music video
Next video: I’m ignorant, but willing to learn please enlighten those of us who don’t know on the history of pride :) I’ve only known it as a party and want to know what the protest pieces of it are. We need to understand our history in order to move forward as a society
Pride is for every person who doesn't care about your sexual "preferences" but for you as a person, for open minded people. I don't care if they're straight or gay, you can support gays without being gay.
Donald  Trump  cancelled  the LGBT  freak  show  the first  day  he  got  into  office...
Isn’t Ariana grandes brother gay
I don't think the big issue is Ariana being at pride, it's much more the issue of ticket prices being so expensive because she is headlining, to the point that most people can't afford to go. that along with the fact that many people feel uncomfortable going because they know people who are outspokenly homophobic and transphobic who will be there solely because of Ariana. I completely support having cishet allies at pride, it just becomes an issue when homophobic and transphobic people are going to see a musician, or people are having to pay ridiculous prices to go to something that should be for them
I don’t like her music but I get wasted at pride so it doesn’t matter.
This is great, and you make many good points, but considering Ariana’s latest music video feat. queerbaiting, I’m not so sure she knows what it means to be an ally. Furthermore, non-queer people who are going to pride need to know that it is not about them, and Ariana headlining and charging money for the limited tickets available seems like she’s making it about her. Allies at pride is great, but they need to know how to act as an ally and not as a festival-goer, particularly not fetishizing the community. I see it at gay bars all the time, people who insist they are straight grinding on someone who does not appear to be the opposite/a different sex, only so they can pretend to be gay/queer for a night. If you’re going to be an ally and come to pride, great. The more the merrier. Just know how to be an ally before you get there.
You are gay
i think a problem that most people had with it was the ticket price increase. of course Ariana’s a bigger name than, say, Rita Ora, who has headlined Manchester Pride before. But Pride should be an accessible event. a jump from £35 to £70 is one that not a lot of queer people can afford, especially the queer youth of areas that are still quite deprived in northern England. the event has also gone from being one that welcomes all ages to one that is now only 18+. i went to my first Manchester Pride at 15 and whilst i didn’t attend the festival that year, i would have been able to. one of my favourite things about pride is the age differences, i’ve noticed that a lot of older queer people and allies will lift up the youth; push them closer to the front at the parade so they can see more, talk to them about their experiences etc. To me, it has become clear that the organisers of Manchester Pride have found a way to profit from a marginalised group. i am aware that some of the money goes to queer charities (i’m not sure how much) but it sickens me that we have gone from being deeply oppressed (and some of us still are) to being something to capitalise from. it seems wrong. i’m sure Ariana will do a great job, Manchester means a lot to her and she means a lot to the city. i just hope she uses the platform in the right way. thank you for making this video tyler 💖
Ariana is not right person for pride who ever put this together is not about pride it about making money  is she making money off this pride
I was hoping manchester pride could be my first pride. Ive been out as bi for 4 years and i havent been to pride. But the prices for manchester are ridiculous and limited and due to the amount of not lgbtq+ people going probably just for ariana, it doesnt make me comfortable. if you arent part of the lgbtq+ community and are going to pride, know that this event isnt about you, its not about you wanting to see your fave celebrity performing. Its about celebrating the lives of those in the lgbtq+ community. If you are homophobic, transphobic, queerphobic etc, then stay at home. We dont want toxic people at pride. We dont care if two people of the same gender kissing makes you uncomfortable, it is pride. It is our safe space. If you dont like it, then dont f*cking come. If you are homophobic etc but want to see ariana, then buy tickets to one of her concerts, not pride. Pride isnt a concert, its a celebration. If you dont want to celebrate with us, then dont come.
Ariana Grande is also performing at Coachella- which is put on by a terrible man who donates money to anti-LGBT organizations and causes. SO WHERE DOES SHE REALLY STAND!? She can’t do both. She can’t.
I think that saying somebody doesn’t belong at gay pride is a little hypocritical considering that we all want equality so it’s almost like excluding somebody because they aren’t gay I think we shouldn’t exclude someone for participating in something because they aren’t gay or straight or white or black or whatever
No
I'm glad Ariana was there. Everyone is WELCOME! This shouldn't be a debate! I am bisexual and I think everyone is making a big deal about it instead of trying to enjoy Pride. Like, seriously get over it!
I don’t think arianna grande shouldn’t be allowed at pride, the problems I have are (as well as increased ticket prices which many have stated) is she has so many straight fans who are going to take tickets away from queer people who want to attend as well as taking a platform away from lgbt artists. There are so many such as Adam Levine, years and years, Demi lovato, Sam smith, brendon urie, who are big enough to headline such a festival, but by Arianna grande taking it she is denying them a stage that was built for them! She has the opportunity to headline every festival in the world. Why does she have to take one of the only queer ones?
The whole point of pride is to celebrate queer people and uplift their voices and experiences. Queer people should be performing at pride. Straight allies are allowed, of course, but they need to take a backseat here. I don’t think Ariana Grande is necessarily a bad person, but she needs to take a seat and leave room for queer artists.
We were not created gay! He will explain it to you! Molested by a demon! Say no to gay sex and hello to Dad! Our father! He forgives and has ultamte love for you! Talk to him! He's waiting for you to talk to him. He is there for you! Don't ever forget it! Ever!  Much love. Love each other but no sex! See you in heaven!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I’m bi myself and I feel like straight people can be at pride but not just be there for their own music (Ariana). Or to be rude to anyone who is part of lgbtq + if they are there to support  people then I feel they can go and learn about people in the lgbtq+ community
It’s not the problem of Ariana herself being at pride. It’s the people that she’ll attract. So many straight people are going to go with the express intent of seeing Ari; not to support pride.
1 comment i am BI
I don't nor have I ever understood why the LGBT community all of a sudden has an issue with non queer supporters like wth we want to be accepted and want peace and all that but it's pointless when we exclude others who want nothing but to spread love and their gifts and to lift the community up ariana should 100% be at pride she's been a supporter from day one and anyone who supports or is in the community deserves to be at pride. End of story
To the question, 'does she belong at pride's, the answer is yes. There is no reason why not. Everyone who supports should be able to go.🙃❤️
I guess its alright for Ariana and other straight artists to perform (as long as they're not homophobic), but people that come just to see that artist is the real problem, especially if they are homophobic or any shit like that. This right here is what people should be talking about and acting against, because coming just to see the artist along with being homophobic in a place where us queers are meant to feel safe is honestly just kind of fucked up...
lol what if ariana isn’t straight
I think she definitely should be invited. Why? A LOT of homophobic people are that way because they don’t know any gay people and have never met any gay people...so maybe they’ll go to Pride to watch Ariana and potentially see that we’re no different than them.
The problem is the limited tickets, obviously you can’t have unlimited access for security purposes. Ariana isn’t the problem either the same issue could rise with any artist, lgbt+ or not. It’s just up to the morality of allies. The pride last for like a week? And there are so many different events! if you want to show support just go to the events that don’t have limited tickets and you are not taking the space for someone else. I go to support my friends. Sometimes its hard for people who are not out yet to go by themselves.
The HUGE Pride event that Manchester has become is not a pride it is a “show” of lgbt people bc of the ticket prices and nonqueer artists instead of celebrating queer artists. Just like queer awards that go to allies. And especially Ariana Grande who literally JUST released her insanely biphobic and fetishizing queer women in her break up with your girlfriend video. Sick

Ariana Grande is bisexual
Yas
Ari is QUEEN and she's such a wonderful person! Yassssss ma gurl Ari!
Grande Fans where u at?
Understandable U_U
I think if she supports us and wants to show that then we shouldn't stop her but hey that's just my opinion ❤
YES SHE DOES BELONG!!!!! 😤😥❤💖
Totally agree. Performers don’t have to be part of lgbt to perform at pride, all that matters is that they support their community and show it, exactly like you said.
I think the more the merrier! I think it’s amazing that we have more allies and more people are going to be accepting us now so many of their idols are showing support! All I want is for everyone to be supported and happy and safe and proud of their identities ^ - ^
she is headlining coachella which doates to anti lgbt organizations !! that isn't showing up for the community and it's really upsetting
Ariana supports her brother and does belong at pride!
💛
I think yes because it shows it doesn't take someone queer to support the lgbt+ community.
It's obviously different for people who are headlining like Ariana but i'm not part of the LGBT+ community and i still feel like i should be welcomed at pride.. for me it's more about letting everyone live however they want to If that makes sence. :)
pride should be for everyone, no matter if youre straight, gay, bi, whatever. if you want to be accepted for who you are as non straight people, then you cant segregate towards people who are straight. everyone is equal, and if you want to be treated as such, then treat everyone else like you treat your queer peers, even if they dont support your lifestyle
okay muscles😳💪🏼
The idea that we could have all queer people headlining Pride is great in theory, but it’s just like Tyler said it’s not that easy. I do agree, however, that if the person headlining is not queer and cis if they have been active allies of the past and uplift, help build platforms, and let people know about current and amazing upcoming queer artists then those are the types of people we need at Pride. It should be for everyone that wants to help keep these events a comfortable and safe space and if outsiders come to learn about us then I think there isn’t a more wonderful and better opportunity than Pride.
Meanwhile she is headlining Coachella and we all know about the guy who runs that show........
Ariana’s brother is part of the 🏳️‍🌈 community and she’s VERY supportive. I don’t see a problem with her being there. I think she’s an asset imo
After Ariana Grande held One love Manchester why not
Anyone like p!nk, Brendon, lady Gaga etc should be allowed there Ariana isn’t one of them so I agree with Tyler 110%
Tyler Oakley has aged! Seeing him again after a long time, but good lord look at how thin his skin is looking.
People that shouldn't attend pride: 
-police
-politicians
-cishets
-allies

Pride is for LGBT+ people, not for cishets, cops, or politicians. Ariana should not be at pride. 

Big name performers that should headline pride: Adam Lambert, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Brendon Urie
If allies can't preform at Pride, than does that mean they can't be there at all? I feel like if I went, it would only be because of my straight allies going with me. I think she should most definitely be there. So should any one else even if they are straight/cis of they support us and help us, then why act heterophobic towards them? That makes us no better than homophobic people.

Y’all literally talked about this during a recent psychobabble episode... stop acting surprised
If you want that big butt just keep doing squats 🙌 I'm telling from experience 😂
Tyler’s laugh 😂 I haven’t watched a video in a while and now I remembered why I subscribed 😂
You and korey were talking about one of your friends who wear these on the podcast. Maybe thats where they got it?

I wish we could have seen Anthony's reaction. Super cute / funny video though
5:16 is me trying to be cool in anyway!!!! Honey I relate!!!
Assessment of the day

I wish we could have seen if your bf believed it
When did you become such a daddy?
Oh damn so turned on haha
I tried the butt-up underwear that was kinda like a weird jock strap, they were meh, but all mine. kinda like a push up bra, not a total lie, but a bit of one
I didn’t expect to watch this...
I have the first pair. Lol I get cat called at work... I wish I was thicc...
A sis is swole! What the heck
The surprise is when you sit down 😂😂😂😂
“She thicc..WAHH!”  😂
That booty though 💯
Holy moly. Haven’t seen him in years. When did he get hot?!
I'm just sitting in bed at four a.m. cackling manically... If my roommates kick me out I blame you!
It‘s not sideboob anymore - it‘s sidebutt. (The motto of the last underwear option) 😂
Hell yeah @tyler
i couldn't help but die when he sayed "ooooh she thicc"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
5:16 im dead
Hit or Miss, I bet they never miss... huh?
5:17 me XD
This is creepy cuz I was just thinking about how whenever I take a picture on Snapchat of food a food sticker shows up and whenever I take a picture of my dog a pet filter shows up
i love this 😂
Lmao this was so funny
this whole video is a mood
Preeeeetty sure it was a psychobabble discussion a few weeks ago...
Okay why would I use this as a joke but really want to use it bc I don’t have a butt soooo thx Tyler.

Where’s the link sis??
I miss the people that were big on YouTube in 2014 and 2015
Daaaammmnnnnn
Oh my gosh.... LOL
He's so stereotypical these are the kind of gays that other gays are always being judge, stop watching him he is so extra
My butt is okay, although I wish my chest could be smaller.  Damn ab exercises for being so hard and "tummy tuck" spanx and undergarments being so damn uncomfortable.  I would use them every day if they didn't make feel like a useless blob of pain afterward.
7 minutes of Tyler giggling like a maniac and acting immature. Butt we love it
We love a blue jean queen
the giggles, can i make them my text tone gshsjs
Not to be rude but who are you
Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I’m here with the one and only, MiRandA sInGsSssSss
Hit oR miSS
Tylerrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Too funny!!
He’s riped
Do you shave your legs?
This would be good if you’re in high school sitting for hours on those uncomfortable-ass plastic chairs. You got a little cushion!
casa te commigo
Hiii
thicc
love papasito
💙💚💛🧡💖❤️💜🖤
I was not expecting this, but it made me laugh so it made up for that. 







^literally my life.
Heyyyy gurl❤️❤️❤️
Lol. Fun video
Hellooooo
okay but the underwear with thigh holes did kinda turn me on seeing tyler wear them 😂
“is this test made for straight people?” i screamed
Yes yes the frog crown thing I get that, like I’m fairytales
Hun that score was stating you did better then 57% of the people who took the quiz! So you are better then over half the people who took the test 😊
"this is really YeE-ing my hAw" iM SCREAMING
The text says that you scored better than 57%, not that you got 57! Fun quiz, got 21/24
The starbucks logo is just letting you know she's ready for that caffeine!
"It looks like... You know when frogs wear crowns?"


That made me die laughing Tyler hahaha. I know exactly what you mean though that's actually such an accurate description.
THANK GOD IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO ALWAYS THINKS OF CROWNS FOR FROGS WHEN THEY SEE THE ROLEX LOGO
starbucks logo literally is inspired by twin tail mermaids! which can seperate their tails and get it on. their logo was originally more suggestive showing the whole tails and her boobs, so theres that
Spill some tea on brand deals that didn't go through, I'm bored and want drama.
Thanks for including Closed captions that actually work. Being a Deaf gay man. Thanks for that.
I would inagine same type of crown on frog. Feel u
I still can't get over Tyler's goshdang GUNS
whenever you said "thank you" i just thought "next" why am i like this
"Is this quiz made for straight people" I LAUGHED
Sweetyy tyler it said you did better than 57% of the quiztakers, it doesnt say u got 57% of the asnwers correctly
"This is really... yeeing my haw" SJJSJDKJDKJKJS
It said 57% better than the others, not 57% in total 😂
You're probably never gonna see this, but I just wanna say that I love you and your videos! You and my friends are what helped me understand what being gay/straight is (I grew up in a very strict Christian home, and I was always told that the LGBTQ+ community is wrong.), how it affects you and other people, and that it's okay! I personally am straight with a few gay tendencies, but you helped me realise that even if I wasn't that's okay, so thank you!
You look so much older! You work it tho :)
“This is really yeeing my haw” 😂
we don't even have dominos in finland but i was 100% sure which one was the real logo?? hello?? what am i???
you're like the last person on youtube to make a challenge video and im so proud of you for that
I somehow only got two wrong! How...?? I'm normally terrible!! Tyler, you must just be my lucky charm.
It says you scored better than 57% of quiztakers not that you got 57% correct tho 😂
I actually got 24 out of 24 are you proud
Thats the old dominoes logo...
you have no idea how many "guess the correct logo" apps i've had on my phone
Does I have a problem if I got Them all right ? 😬
Nice shirt🌹
No views but 54 likes. How odd
I thought I was pretty observant





 i was wrong
This just made my day
Who's here from the live video ✔
I'm living for Tyler's shirt!!!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
I too only receive push notifications from various brands and social media cause I have really less friends, who don't even bother to message!!
Thanks Tyler, You make me happy!!
Was this quiz made for straight people? 😂 Me too
"This really is really yeeing my haw"

Yesss 😂😂😂
I got 2 wrong so that would be 22/24
I did bad at this. It hurt!
100%! That got anxiety inducing to get a perfect score near the end! 😂
I only got 13. Perfect example of why you shouldn't second guess yourself 😂
"Is this quiz made for straight people" HAHAHAHAHAHA TYLER
I'm honestly surprised I got them all. Didn't even know half the companies. Good guessing?
Lol Tyler, yeah the Starbucks mermaid 100% is spreading her tails to show her merpuss, the original logo has her on full display.  😆🧜‍♀️
You can guess so many of these right just by knowing basic design/layout/color theory "rules of thumb." The wrong ones just look so.... wrong lmao
lmaooo 4:33 i love how you said that with such confidence, as if it were common knowledge 😂
Tyler: the wrong one is very off putting

Me: okay but when did I ask for relationship advice?
Well I'm never looking at the Starbucks logo the same again lol
“I get really nice 6 inch... turkey sandwich”. Ya sure, sandwich 😅❤️
I played along and got 6 wrong. Felt good to me.
pleeeease do more Mamrie colabs! I’ve been rewatching the same ones weekly for the last two years. 😂
It said that you did better than 57% of all test takers - not that you got 57% ☺️
21/24
“You know when frogs wear crowns?” —Tyler Oakley 2019

YAAAASS Tyler slaaaay 😋😋😋
Ty ilu but can u pls ask ur editor to lower the levels on the music tracks!! I’ve noticed this a lot in your vids lately but it’s v distracting from ur cutie patootie voice okay ??
The frog-crown reference is so so right! That was one hundred percent my first thought. I was not consciously aware of it before but I do classify crowns into frog and non-frog crowns....
I would say since your college vids, I’ve been here 🤔 only a little while 👀 Love your shirt btw 😊
it said you did better than 57% of other people lol
That shirt gives me Scott Hoying vibes and i like it
The KFC one has the stripes on the apron placed on the other side
Frogs wearing crowns. We know what u mean Tyler!
can’t believe u got google wrong of all things. GOOGLE.
Same Scoreee
23/24!
My Tyler 💙
I got 20/24!! Also, tyler, I love you and your videos ah!
“Is this test made for straight people” I’m weak that was the best 😂😂
23/24
Hey Tyler! I love you so, so much. 😚
tyler sweetie you're doing amazing
I got 19/24 so only 5 were wrong :)
Oh yes tyler is back for another video




Our queen
I love you, Tyler and we're born in the same year of 1989!!!
Yeah, I didn't keep track, there were a few that I strongly said the wrong answer in my head. As a person who saw a John Deer logo every day for like 21 years I am relieved I got that one right because I had a strong moment I thought it was the wrong one. And as my Auntcle Jen would loudly say John Deer doesn't make it straight, it just made it more lesbian
I got every logo right. Except for the kfc logo
I got the same score as Tyler but on different logos
Remember when my mom took a pic of me meeting you and Kory in LAX and she took it upside down cause I remember that
I would say most of those logos follow proper graphic design rules so it's easier to spot the difference simply because of that. There were some like the pizza hut logo that are just dumb so it's nearly impossible to know for sure.
Omg 😂 i love it
"you know when frogs wear crowns?" even if it sounds weird somehow im pretty sure almost everyone can relate to what tyler was thinking
no views club!!!!! love ya tyler
it said that you did better than 57% of the quiz takers DUH!!!
Yes I’d love a react viddy!!!
I only missed two... one of them being Instagram 🤦🏻‍♀️
I got 22/24
Yes reacting to old brand deals pls
A lil bit outdated
anybody else singing along to funky town with the background music?
omg i adore your shirt
i got 22
I missed 5 lol
the last time i was that early Nicole Paige Brooks from Atlanta Georgia was still on DragRace
i got a 96% wow

Starbucks and Tyler Oakley are my two favorite things lmao Also Tyler you beat me good job
We got the same score! We awesome.

21/24 Ever so slightly a better score than yours XD
Ur videos are the best , thank u and ilysm 😍😍😍😍🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
You look soo much older in a good way: your in really good shape.
Hello Tyler,I finally got here early.
100% biiiiiiiish!
Also the Starbucks logo is inspired by Greek mythology,  the two tailed mermaid (hence the design), or a siren, who lures sailors to shipwreck
I got 22 right
So happy I got 24/24
i've been subscribed to you forever and i thought you just stopped making videos because they never pop up on my timeline??
Did anyone notice the holes in his socks during the Starb's moment? XD
Hello! 🖤
this was so much fun lol
Omg brand-deal throwback! !!
I got 20 out of 24 too!
21 right 😎
You got a pass (83%) and scored better than 57% of the people who took the test, you’re in the 57 percentile but that’s isn’t your score
I LOVE YOU SO FRICKEN MUCH!!! MIRE THAN CHEESE
Tyler got so hot omfg
The Starbucks logo is actually a siren with a split tail! :)
21
ilysm
made 4 mistakes and i honestly didn’t know every brand in that quizu
Tyler, I want you to do more of these!! Love ya...muuuahhhh!!!😘😘😘
After all those tweets,  I can’t stop looking at Tyler’s lips.
I got 7 wrong so... 71% and I’m kicking myself cuz I thought I knew the Instagram one. Live and learn
I shouldn't be this proud of myself but omg I got them all right 😂🎉🎊
QUEEN👏🏼

Also your shirt is adorable and so are you
ilysm tyler!
This dude became so irrelevant.
Notification Squad!! ♥️♥️
Got 24 out of 24

I got 6 wrong
I got 17/24
Tyler you need to collaborate with

Never clicked so fast 😂😍
You are as sweet as pie
I got 18 right
100%
saw your tweet:) love the video.<3also first
He said "I sometimes get a nice six inch" and then really quickly: "turkey!" 😂😂
You should try comparing new and old logos (or logo transformation over the years) :D I'd love to see your reactions! <3
Noo you're in the 57% percentile. It means that you did better than 57% of people (so about average to the rest of the population that has done it) not that 57% was your score.
I got 18 correct and 6 wrong. Good job Tyler! You did better than me.
OAKLEY DOAKLY
Tyler: "I actually like black and blue together..."
Kinky
Ahh I used to watch your videos and recently have re discovered them! Since when did you become soo musclar and buff?!?!! Looking amazing Tyler ! Thoes arms tho...dammmnnnn.💜💜💜
I remember doing these quizs all the time a few years ago
this is my first time watching tyler in years 
lowkey thought he left u tube
I got 18/24
Tyler did you read what the 57% meant😂😂😂 love u
missed you tyler!! ❤
Thanks you editing....you get most incorrect
Wow, how am I so bad at that
"is this quiz made for straight people" lmao i can't
I only got three wrong! I’m not counting the crocodile one cause I’ve never seen that before
I missed YOU TYLER 
BECAUSE I HAVE FRIKING SCHOOL
Honey, it says you scored better than 57% of quiztakers 😹💞
“I feel attacked” 😂😂😂 M00D! 🙆🏻‍♂️
91% 
Getting John Deere and Instagram wrong perfectly defines me in the weirdest way.
💚💚💚
23/24! Only one I got wrong is KFC.
I’ve missed you!  This is the old Tyler we love. ❤️
Yes omg my favorite album of hers. Bad Idea is my anthem!
WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT TEXTS TYLER???? Guuuuuurrrrl we know it's blowing up ALL. THE. TIME.
.01 in....WTF??
Tyler, you misread the 57%.  That meant that YOU did better than 57% of ALL people who took the quiz.
The “is this quiz made for straight people?” had me laughing tbqh....I love how Tyler isn’t afraid to say literally ANYTHING 😂😂😂😂😂💞
I got 14 right, but as a non American I don’t know all those brands
I got 19...catching up to u Tyler lol
You seem more like a 12” boy to me, Tyler. 😏
that shirt is v cute
more importantly where'd you get that shirt i NEED
Love you Ty!!!
you should collab with James Charles
I got two wrong and I had to turn my brightness up for uncle Ben lmao
Tyler Oakly is the best <3
HEY TYLER!!! 
Sadie.way
When you said that the crown looked like a crown for a frog, I thought of the movie 'Princess and the Frog' omg memories! Haha
24 out of 24
YASSSS. The frog crown. I see it as well.
#amazingrace
That's definitely the old Subway logo
When Tyler said his favorite song was Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored I started singing it! 😍
It was that you did better that 57% of quiz takers not you got 57%
22 out of 24! Tech. & communications class coming in handy. :)
Same
Very sad Tyler
im halfway through the video and so far i've had everything right should i be concerned
How would Starbucks lady hold up her fins (as I assume you mean the lower parts of a mermaids tail), they would have to be damn long to be able to do that. :D
I also got 20/24 right, but I got some of the ones you missed and missed some of hte ones you got so :/
i love you so much tyler 😘😘
YESS DO THE BRANDEAL REACTION
You've yee'd your last haw, pardner.
19/24
Wait, you should react to the cringe. We all love the cringe.
It’s saying you did better than 57% of the people who took it. Like the 57th percentile.
no views yet 190 likes okay youtube
I work at subway and I got it wrong😂😂😂
tyler...... it says you scored 57% higher than others
I can't believe how old Tyler looks now... really makes you realize we're all gonna die one day. :(
Ayeeee all of my friends take ham at Subway finally someone takes turkey at subway!
21/24. Bish I'm not doing math tyvm
Also this is not supposed to sound offensive or rude but when did you you start working out and growing your arms to become really muscular? Because you look great😀
I got like 90% bc i missed less than you
Rolex definitely owes you money for elevating the depth of meaning in their logo
18/24 for me.
I spent 5 minutes pausing the video and looking at the NASA logos and I can't see the difference! Isn't both of them identical? I feel so stupid 😂 Edit: My color settings screwed me over 😂
Omg I got 3 wrong. You are amazing and a beautiful person
You scored 57% better than other test takers haha! But nice job!
I counted 23 but that couldve been wrong
I got 19/24 and I'm proud of it lol

I got 23 right
legend has it that tyler wont see this comment ;D
“This is really yeeing my haw”
Luv u💜
Even with my good eyes, I missed a few. 😅
I feel like I only got most of these right because I have a natural feel for artistic flow and not because I have seen or care about any of these buuuuuuuuuuut, oh well.
Is it bad that I forgot this guy existed
Missed 5!
57% more than other people
You copied SSSniperwolf's thumbnail!
I got six wrong...which means six logos are actually not that good looking in my opinion
I failed so badly I’m actually kinda upset about it
Tyler! You should read the result report carefully!!!
you DID BETTER THAN 57%
You’re good at figuring out brands but you struggle at reading results. Lol
I got all of them right except 1
I missed 2

i teamed up with my roommate who knows a lot about horticulture and I think we came up with some pretty good names. So #1 which she believes is a snake plant could be named Salazar (after Salazar Slytherin). #2 she thinks is a ficus, commonly referred to as the rubber plant, so that could be named Trojan (no explanation necessary). Lastly #3 looks like a tropical elephant ear plant, so we decided on Eureka after the elephant queen herself, Eureka O'Hara. This was a 20 minute process coming up with these names please enjoy.
you already know how fast i clicked on this video

No 3 plant strikes me as a Doreen....
I thought their names were obvious.  1. Theodore, 2. Alvin, 3. Simon.  Cmon Tyler, give us harder questions.
1) Charlie, 2) Shelly, 3) Bernice
Idk if you're still taking names for the plants but the small one seems like a Sebastian to me.
I feel like in most situations it's better to actually say you're awkward/shy and joke about it. I find that it often takes a bit of the tension away especially if it's obvious you both feel the same, I mean why try to hide it haha. That can also lead to sharing funny awkward stories or just chatting about situations you both find awkward (an easy way to find things in common, they're generally pretty universal), makes you relatable and likeable !
Plant names:  Lady Lucy and  Georgiana

If I  were gay I'd have NO problem getting a boyfriend. It's getting the GIRLS to notice me that's MY biggest problem.
You'd think gay guys wouldn't be into me for the same reasons most girls don't seem to notice me but for some reason that's not an issue. lol

Plant #1 should be named Charlie. I don’t know why but I’m vibing with it.
Does this apply to girls and nbs too?
So my friend put a guy she thought I would be cute with in a group chat with me than left with the fleeting message you guys would look cute together and let’s just say I’m awkward and shy and I kinda fcked it up
Who’s cuter, Tyler or the dog?
"Gaga is a genus of 19 species of ferns in the family Pteridaceae named after American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga. Two of the 19 species are newly-described—Gaga germanotta from Costa Rica, named after the family of the singer, and Gaga monstraparva, in honor of Gaga's fans, whom she calls "little monsters"."

"i want a big, huge somethin"


so do i, tyler. so do i.
I am a lesbian but damn Indar makes me question my sexuality.
Love the uniqueness of ur videos lately keep it up! Feel like ur finding a new u!!!
Indar must breathe such good air
A sugar daddy lol and by that I mean be a baker for a day!
this is the kind of wholesome content I signed up for
omg Indar has such a bright energy and he seems like he has such a sweet personality. love him
Tyler saying "oasis" subtly like "oh ayy sis" is a mood
indar is so cute, keep him
I need Indar to be my friend. I LOVE plants! 🌿
Indar, start a side hustle as a plant stylist! I fully believe people in LA would pay you to shop for plants with/ for them. You could also do a monthly fee based service where you offer plant support, like website support, but for people that are dumb with plants.

If that business can work anywhere it's LA!
The real question is, do the pots have drainage holes?????
because if not I´m pretty sure there will be root rot...
Tyler is honestly is living his best life we stan a plant daddy
never expected to see my insta crush on your channel but here we are
Do you see his muscles!? When did it happen!?
I can't beLEAF this transformation! I'm sure it will grow on me... 😆
Ok but Indar is beautiful i-
"Not a human daddy." 😂
I am living for this! I want to do this is my place, and I am so inspired! Plant parenthood here I come!
Wow 😲 Indar that’s so many plants 🌱 I love it!!
Try to keep them alive & you will be doing better than phil 🌱🌵☠
Tyler gOT RIPPED TF
Tyler, since you have "been there", can we see the a vlog of you strapped into a harness? 😉  Thirsty, but you went there. 😂.  ❤️🌈
OU HE FINE
Phil Lester and danisnotonfire are emoing & quaking.
Daniel Preda and Ryland Adams are gonna be shook.



New BF  !?
“Glitz! Glamour! Elegance! Eleganza! She’s giving me everything.”
Tyler ur the best 😂
Wait until you graduate to orchids. You never think you will, then one day, one catches your eye and you're smitten. Then when that first spike drops its last blossom, you go through agony and impatiently wait for the next bloom cycle. Then the ecstasy when that new flower spike emerges.
All the dirt on the floor was triggering!
Indar is Neville Longbottom vibes and I'm living for it 😻
Somebody introduce Indar to Phil Lester, he needs someone to save his plants
Wow it looks gorgeous!! I also want to get some green when I have my own house, it looks the house and aura of clean and pure, love it!
Smart to pick plants that less easy to kill on the first try.  Plants change daily. Like a pet you only have to water and feed from time to time. Looking good Tyler. Indar is a cutie patootie. Boyfriend material Tyler.
I am proud to be the mother of a two year old cactus. It grows and doesnt die. All that I want from my children.
What happened to Jesse Metcalfe though?
Congratulations. You officially have a "green thumb!" 💚🌱🌴🍀🌿👍🏼
Plant moms have entered the chat
You’re now a plant daddy
Omggg he has variegated monsterras I’m  dying those are so rare they’re worth thousands😍😍

Tyler omg I’m one of the first to watch this and I wanted to tell you how much u inspire me, I’m 14 and also gay u helped me come out to my family so thank you 🙏
Those arms ...Tyler
Blanche Devereaux.... Is that you?!?!
REASONS WHY THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE:
1.) Tyler Oakley is one of the OG YouTubers, and he's really just out here living his best life with this content
2.) Indar is the sweetest, sexiest man I think my eyes have ever seen. I want him in my life, and inside of me. 
3.) Low-key educational. I learned plant names, and some helpful tips for proper plant care. 
4.) That plant arrangement is fuckin' beautiful, and it started as a blank wall! 2019 Glow-up of the year??
5.) The ever-so-slight sexual tension between these two  is really makin' me feel some type of way

10/10 loved it. ❤️

This inspires me to get a load of plants and be a plant father.
your home looks so much better with the plants! they are so cute
Oooh be a chef daddy
Wholesome plant content 🌱
I would LOVE to see you be a nanny/babysitter for a day! But if that's not an option, a day in the life of a chef, barista, baker, shoe salesman, zookeeper, tour guide, or talk show host (move over Ellen!) would be immensely entertaining! Hell, I'd even watch you looking at clouds or rocks lol! I'm sure whatever you choose to do next will be awesome no matter what! Keep up the good work- you've been killing it!
Indar is beautiful from the outside and high chance on the inside. But I suggest you, Tyler teach him a little more about being infront of YouTube camera. Don't know his background but I suspect he had media coaching from TV people which is a different kind of beast all together.
Forget having kids, it’s all about being a parent to plants in 2019!
You're my first favorite youtuber I watched and I'm still here. 💚💚
Phil is quaking
Wow, he’s gorgeous inside and out!
Becom a fast food daddy 😂
LOL      you did it all wrong!!!!   You transplanted them into pots with no DRAINAGE!!!    All will ROT!!!!!   None of those even needed to be transplanted.   Those pots are fine.  You just put them inside the ones with no holes!!
Ahhh I love it! Welcome to plant-parenthood 😘🌳🌿☘🌱
Awww Jesse Metcalfe! That’s a blast from the past. Thanks for the inspiration! Could really do with some more plants in my house 🌱 Yours look great 😍
Heyyy!!!! I'm like, overly obsessed with this video lmaooo I love
It's beautiful I was thinking my bedroom needs a plant too
So pretty!!!
I'm into it! Looks good!
Greetings from Argentina Tyler 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷❤️❤️❤️
Yesss I remember the gardener too!!!!!   Looks so good ❤️

It’s a cute set up omg !!
This was so precious. I now need 10 plant babies of my own!
IM IN LOVE W THIS!!!!
you are my queer inspiration oh my god i love you💜
100 % Dom daddy next.
Am I the only person who finds the potting part weirdly satisfying?
A little grodacious.....???? OMG...stop it tyler...
Yes! We love a plant king 🌱
I love your video subed and noted
You guys are so funny **new sub. Luv the energy keep up the great work🌱🌳👍
I love you so much! I can't believe at met you at CMU ❤❤❤❤
I DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I WATCHED THIS BUT EVERY TIME I DO IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER😍 YOU ARE THE BEST YOUTUBER, LOVE YOU!😘😘😍😍😍
im watching the stream on insta right now and i love this
Love it!!!!!!!!! 😍 that magical wall! 🌱🍀🌳 x
So.... I LOVE that wall but question.... How do you water the hanging plant that's closest to the ceiling? Ladder? Just curious! Lol
Oh my god the desperate housewives reference happened just as I was watching it in the background and the hot gardener appeared as soon as Tyler mentioned him. Amazing show love it 
I’m definitely Susan (Teri Hatcher) 😂😂😂
1. Do not over water (#1 killer of house plants)
2. Get a soil moisture meter on Amazon 
3. Loves y'all energy!
1st comment and I don't even watch this channel
Don't let them die Tyler😂. We are all ready for the living room jungle💞🍂🍁🌿🌳🌱
Did any of those pots have drainage holes?  Lack of proper drainage causes root rot very easily so please water carefully! ( I'd recommend double potting or getting pots with drainage holes+ saucers)
Please do this for me
Amazing! Looks beautiful 😍
If you didn’t get a cactus, Riley is going to attack you and so will I
Hey came from Instagram live❤️
We love some plant daddies
You just look so good Tyler, I mean talk about beauty inside and out 🤗 Who knew that Tyler Oakley would turn into such a snack 😍
Oh dear God, Indar... Those abs... Yoga is really doing it's stuff😏
(0:23)
I mean nice plants, I really like them...😅
(0:43)

Also, my recommendation for "daddy", why don't you become a kindergarten teacher for a day
Yes, Indar is totally hot! But you're going to regret not having drainage for some of those plants. The water needs to drain through so you don't get root rot. But you did get really cool pots....
The true question is:








Find out in the next episode of 
you really did it! wow so great.
I ship you and Indar 💚
Fish daddy! You guys are so beautiful i can hang you on my wall😂
omg yes yes yes! I really hope the Jungalow Style becomes a thing!!!
As a plant lover, this is the best video into the entire world. 🍃🌱🌿 ONE DAY I’ll get to this level hahaha
When does the BelAmi collab video drop?
Tyler I love you am bisexual and just say u are my inspiration and you helped me come out so thanks queen
Tyler, I can't believe you got a lot of plants at your house in your living room and I love it, but I'm very proud of you for that!!! ☺
I'm single an live in michigan Indar I'm single an TBH I love you so freaking much!😍❤
"remember that hot gardener in Desperate Housewives, or am I totally aging myself because all of you have only seen Riverdale" had me dying
You are way hotter then desperate housewives gardener
Omg a plant obsessed person like me, yaaaaaaayyyy, I literally knew all the names too, ahhh I love plants😂😍💚💚💚
Tyler dear you look like Bill Gates. Keep going, best luck, - Amit from India.
Do these pots have drainage holes on the bottom? So funny you uploaded this because I also am collecting plants!
okay queen of DIY
5 views wow
Wooooah.. tyler okley with GUNS????.. WOW!
Beautiful plant selection and arrangement <3RIP for that calathea ahead of time... JK
That looks FABULOUS!!! Always getting me in a better mood, Tyler <3 <3
Love the energy here.  So happy you have surrounded yourself with wonderful people (and now plants), Tyler.
Tyler’s Arms 💪🏻 Damn!  Also why don’t your videos show up in my subscriptions anymore?
I am the proud daddy of many many plants, and i am SO glad to see that you are now as well :D  Enjoy the green life
Tyler: “we gotta strap her into her harness”
Tyler: “been there” 😂😂
Could you start adding closed caption to your videos? Like Nyle Dimarco said there are 70 million deaf people worldwide so do please make your video accessible for all. ☺️😘
Desperate Housewives was everything. I miss that show. Mike Delfino ❤️
Beautiful job, it looks fantastic!! I am an Orchid grower and I just stumbled upon this video and I like everything you did enjoy your babies!!
be a cat daddy, a rabbit daddy,
Yasss plants. You need orchids 😁
Honestly Ty, I feel we are on the same wave length. I am just about to start my plant mama journey! Loved this video so much! Getting me so excited 😍🌱🌿🌵
The plant corner becomes the focal point of your living room. Just beautiful! 
Is it tiresome when it comes to watering day?
Indar is UNREAL gorgeous omg
When Tyler was picking the favorite hanging plants, he liked pothos (Epipremnum) but they misnamed it philodendron...

And all those pots without drainage!
I love that tall compact dracaena. Great job putting it all together.
ツ indar is a good papa, tyler's plants will be less lucky ones¨̮
OH MY LORD! I Loooove this! tyler + plants = happiness for me
Welcome to the crazy plant lady club 🥰🤪🌵🌺
Plantuary.
It’s so pretty and aesthetic! Omgg
I'm here because of Indar i follow him on ig. But damn tyler as such a personality like he's bringing good vibes I better have to subscribe to his channel. Luv u so much dudes 🤗
Ooh I loved seeing Indar in one of your videos! He seems just as nice as he comes across on Instagram🤗
love how knowledgeable he is about plants :) <3
IF the plants DiE (hopefully not) then you're not ready for a doggo lol this is a test to see if you can care for other living things lmao (kidding ;) or am i??) xD
OMG that variegated monstera is stunning!
I've been in love with Indar for about a year now, so you can imagine I liiiived through this whole video. Love it so much and love your plants, Ty.
Dang indar quit smiling! Im already blushing

Thank you very much
Omg tyler is so damn fine n omg that body.
Your dracaena compacta is very close to the window, make sure it's not getting any direct sunlight or it's going to die:)
I'm not sure about planting directly into the containers with no drainage holes. It is possible, contrary to what most people say in the 'plant world'  but it makes watering much more challenging. You need to be really careful not to make the soil too wet or the roots will easily rot. And that can be pretty frustrating specially for beginners.
But besides that, this was such a nice and inspirational video to watch! Congratulations and thank you Tyler. 😊
I low-key learned so much with this video
Tyler bringing us something to snack on. 😍😍
Love you! Great inspiration! Have you ever heard of the band Why Don't We?
I really want to see a video where Tyler goes to a farm and helps out for the day! I feel like that would be such a great video!!!
DRAINAGE?? COME ON!!
I am so excited to watch Tyler's plants grow in each new video
Hey tyler I made my first youtube channel called Amber's fun videos if you wanna watch. 😉 I'm sorry I forgot to mention I watch your vidoes but I will so mention in my second video I'm making in a few weeks from now. Love you tyler!❤😍
The sheer number of sexual innuendos made my morning 😅 thanks for that😂
Omg. This is plant goals. I need to step up my game.
this video is so cute!!!! i want a plant sanctuary in my house now 😍
wow suddenly need to go buy 20 plants?? 🌱
I love you so much! Your videos have kept me from self harm so many times btw
So no drainage holes? 
they're all going to get root rot 😬 
next time leaf them in their plastic pots and set the whole thing inside the decorative one. it's called a cachepot or coverpot.
Wow 15h and 22k views your chanel is really dead
Yay love it! I’ve got about 80 indoor plants I’m obsessed 😊
Love you guys. Your plants are beautiful
MIGUEL ON PASSIONS!!!!!! He was SO hot.
New favorite Tyler video! I love the plants
Ugh, white people: "Nice wall you have, I think I'll take it!"...
(jk jk)
P.s. you’re totally the hot gardener, live your fantasy henny
Ok but we’re going to need plant updates!
Girl, I’m also became a plant mommy recently 🤰🏻 and my babies are STRONG loving this life 💚🌱💚
Phil would be so proud 😂
Dang I LOVE it! Looks great.
I wish plants could be my passion but I'm allergic to plants 😂
GOD this makes me want plants but I only have 660 sqft of space....any tips on how to make the space feel bigger yet have some greenery as well? I also have two cats so I can't get some plants cause they'd be poisonous to the cats.
Tyler needs Adam Ellis's "Plant Daddy" shirt now.
wish i could like this video more than once! love love love! 🌱 🌿🌵
Omggg the outcome was amazing!!!
Hey, where’s that planter with the stand from? The one with the sanseviera? Also, love Indar! ❤️🌱
I love you so much Tyler ❤️❤️
What a coincidence... I've been missing having tons of plants when I had a studio room living with my ex of 17 plants, and a pond after that. I've been recently collecting plants again for my small apartment and just finished repotting about 5 new ones today, then logged on and found this. I think I'm up to about 17 again. Keep those plants going, water regularly and you'll be loving the plant life! There's something so nice about having a lot of plant life around your space. Very comforting and healing in a way.
What a refreshing and uplifting video! I wish I had someone in my life to help transform my space into a plant haven, instead of my sad dead plants lol
Plant Dad-Ds! Gotta love attractive men with a green thumb.
I’m so inspired by this video! Nice job!!!
Where are your plant pots from? They are gorgeous!!!
Tyler;  I hope you bought a step-stool... or you'll never reach the hanging baskets to water.    #boyswithplants :)
those new potters could've been a bit bigger.
Omg tyler read my mind. That plant looked just like a wig.
4:08 how do you make "compacta" sound like a drag queen's last name i'm rolling
Well I’m jealous lmao! I’ve been collecting plants for a roughly 5 months and just hit 15! I now I want to go on a spree! Good luck and hopefully you can keep them all healthy and happy! 😊
I looooooove plants
Both of you just got 1000 times hotter
Whatever happened to Jessie Metcalfe? She as a big deal for a like a very hot minute
Loving the plants but can you say root rot? Please at draining holes to the pot so excess water can escape and not damage the roots!!!!!
Oh my gosh!! I love it!! Where did you go to get all the pots?? I have trouble finding nice ones!
INDAR IS ADORABLE. PLANTS LOOKING GORGEOUS. LOOOOVE THE ENERGY OF THIS VIDEO
the chnge shirt oml i love indar
you're amazing and really talented!
This is the plant shopping enabling video I needed in my life
Uuhhh, he is handsome 😍
TYNDAR, I Ship It!
Looks amazing!!! I want to do this now lol
I used to have tons of indoor plants in NYC. It was crazy. I even ran a humidifier for them in winter. But now I live in South Florida. All those indoor plants grow outside here year round. Some like the pothos vines leaves become MASSIVE here!
I just wanna be best friends with Indar so we can talk about our plants 😩
So much love for you Tyler 💓💓
Sooo jealous. 😍🌿🍀🌱🌵😍
I kind of want to do this 🤩
Hi Tyler. You mean SO much to me. My dad died a year ago today and watxhing your vidros and reading your book as well as listening to your Audio book has been very inspiring to me and has helped me get through a lot. Can i get an autograph? It would mean the entire world to me. You also inspired me to come out and you are just the biggest inspiration for me to be myself and not worry about what others think of. I cannot thank you enough.

Thank you so much. 

Steven Yuna

Lovely composition for your new collection! I also have the bronze pineapple planter from cb2, I did have to drill holes for drainage. I hope that is what you did, otherwise water will pool in the base of the pot and you will have root rot which will kill your plant. As a tip cement planters are super easy to drill!
OMG THE ONE WITH THE FUNKY LEAVES in the lil gold put, IT LOOKS LIKE A RARE BREED OF PINEAPPLLLLE
You should play Dream Daddy!
Kinda seemed as though they were repotting root bound plants in same sized pots... maybe it's just me and I didn't see it properly tho shrug
It looks amazing, but all I could think about is I hope all those pots have drainage holes.
Living for the Desperate Housewives reference
Where do I get an Indar!
this is the 2019 green energy i need in my life tbh
OH MY GOD THAT DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES REFERENCE HAHAHAH (i'm 23 and I still got it ;) )
for the 3% reading this, I hope you become successful in life with everything you dreamed of, and accomplish more than you had imagined. I am a youtuber myself and I'm not asking you to do anything. but I would love to hit  20k by the end of February! THANK YOU, ALL OF YOUTUBE
Hi
Indar is freaking adorable ... and I love the wall !!!
The pots need drainage! Plus when u change the pot usually u change it with a size bigger! But aside that.... that corner looks lovely , defo better with the plants than without 👍
Love it. What kind is the super tall one
5 likes and I will do a very risky frontflip over a dark and murky river and then upload it right now
OMG Tyler your everything lol
So he just spent like around 2k between the plants and the planters he purchased. Ok...
Awesome just one thing - drainage holes...
Love your plant wall! 💚💚💚
Yaaaassss!!!! Other Plant Zaddies!!!! ✊🏽
I actually forgot you existed
Awesome! Love seeing more and more people embrace the plant life!
i'm loving the plants bb. i'm a succulent mama so plant parents for life, y'all ! i'd love to see an update video in a hot minute after the plants have had some time to adjust to their new home and learn to live in their new space
I’m dying at the thumbnail😂
So the arms weren't enough? You needed abs too? Ok boo get it!
drools over Tyler's sexy muscle bod 😍😘
PLEEAAAAASE do your workout routine!
Indar has the best smile and is fucking adorable!
Next, try your hand at some seeds, veggies and herbs on the terrace...There’s nothing more satisfying than growing a bit of your own food!  Get Indar to help 😉
That thumbnail thoooo 😂❣️
NO DON’T use miracle grow it has added non organic chemicals you should make your own I only say this because I’ve been working with plants for 15yrs
Omg he's the guy from Instagram with a ballet dancer bf
Wow this video is really the best 😊
You guys are adorable!!!
this is so great because i just started getting this strong urge to grow plants and now i have succulents just chilling by my window in my studio apartment.
I loved the video, but do the pots that you guys bought have holes on the bottom? Cause drainage is SO important in plants!
I love this. I really want a place like this in my house.
I am a cactuses Daddy, you should become one too Tyler!
I loved this video. Before and after videos are so fun to see
The hardest thing is to keep them alive lol
Wow I wish someone loved me half as much as Indar loves his plants
Omg I’m so happy to see plants on a popular youtubers channel like yours.
That calathea lancifolia tends to be really needy and tricky. Just bear that in mind in the future. Indar has other calatheas so he should know what he’s doing though
I feel lile Tyler needs forgiving plants. Like a few Z plants, succulents and cactus,
Love you! Hope you’re well❤️❤️
love this so much!!!
i know that air is Crisp
We better get constant updates on their growth!
Nice plants!  What plant store was that?
indar is gorgeous, tall, dresses well and has a great aesthetic eye 😩
HAS BEEN!!!!!
My roommate and I have a ton of plant children, so i found this video so cute, relatable, and wholesome
i love you!!!!
I'm LEAFing this video
This channel is dying😂
Oop, waaaaait, ain't Indar that ha-white Australian boy's  boyfriend, and Tyler in this video flirting with his dude....That Aussie is a professional dancer and he's very very funny but Tyler ain't even mention him!! Oooop messy alert ⚠ ⚠ level 10!!
You must be rich. I am so jealous! I mean, those pots were all super expensive and those plants were all super expensive. Gosh!!!! (You need some for your patio...I mean, since you're super rich.)
MAKE SURE YOUR PLANT BABIES HAVE DRAINAGE IN THEIR POTS OR THEY WILL DIE LOVE YOU LOVE YOUR PLANT BABIES SEE YA NEXT TIME
Wow! Looks great. One tip is to always water LESS than you think you need to!!! Most people tend to overwater their plants, but in most cases (and you got some nice sturdy ones) you can wait until they seem dry...then wait another week!
uh oh i don't think i can go a day now without seeing Indars face, omg that smile!
Seriously what happened I haven't seen you in my recommendations
Remember what happened to your succulents..... #blackthumb
Tres jolie mur, beautiful results you must take the best insta pic ,What about kitcheN dady next time ?
Basically Phil’s heaven
HIGHKEY plant jealous. I became a plant mother this month too, I now have a calamondin tree and 3 succulents and a spidy baby too. but i loveeee all ur big waxy leaves
TYLERRRR THIS IS SO CUTE I ASPIRE TO HAVE A HOUSE LIKE YOURS
A new plant person should definitely have leca or rocks in the bottom if the plants are planted directly in decorative pots. Otherwise it's soo easy to overwater them. Or planted in terracotta pots with drainage, be gentle with the water <3 :) Beautiful outcome anyhow!
They should have moved the plants into bigger pots. They were already too big for the ones they were in.
I haven’t been here since the flower crown era... got an itch to revisit your channel and I’m in love again!
I managed to kill a cactus so my mum bought me some knitted cacti instead!! 🙈
You gotta mess the roots up a bit before you put them in otherwise they won’t grow further out of their root bound-ness
5 seconds in and I’m like, I love him
Hiiii Indar, how are ya? 😍
My best friend is obsessed with plants, she wants this type of house sooo much
Next up,how to be a muscle daddy 😏
Tyler 2009 🌱 ➡️ Tyler 2019 🌳
Haha good on ya Tyler - you’re jacked!
not to make a scream queens reference or anythinggg but you could do a day as a candle vlogger??
He’s the cutest human being alive
Me eyeing that calathea. Behave.
no tea no shade but forgot you existed, thats okay though because its really pleasant knowing that you do in fact indeed exist
Ah man, I wanna do this with my apartment so bad!!!! Love it!!!
Phil Lester has left the chat
Ahhh I love this!! I’m also a plant daddy! Come find me @leafy.lane!
Lol I haven’t watched Tyler since he was hanging out with Zoella & her crew! It’s good to see he’s still doing well! Happy 30th Tyler!
chameleon daddy!!!!!
Please tell me those pots have drainage 😫
Ily Tyler xxx
I see we're serving cheekbones today
Could not be more inspired
It is so unusual. I like it❤️
Looking like a snack
QUALITY CONTENT
Plants are a work of love !
More of this please!!!
i love indar and his place
Loving this!
I haven’t watched you in so long AHHH UR RIPED
They are very nice! I have a few house plants but very limited options. We have 3 fur babies and a lot of houseplants are toxic to dogs.
they needed bigger pots and drainage holes
What a lovely video <3
So.. Tyler got this idea after visiting Indar's place... after some yoga stretching... I see I seee
Ty, you’re always just the best. Been here since you lip synced for your life to Nicki, and now you’re hitched and have become a plant daddy in a beautiful home of your own. SAP(py) moment - see what I did there - but I’m a proud subscriber 😂❤️
Why does the spider plant remind me of mamez? *mamrie hart of you deserve a drink*🍸🍹
CAN'T. STOP. STARING. AT. THOSE. BICEPS.
I need Indar to have his own channel dedicated entirely to being a plant daddy
i forgot how funny u were 😂
I am livingggg for thissss gahh
Aww who remembers when he was relevant
I love this
this is a d o r a b l e
As part of my rent, I water my landlady’s plants once a week. I have been known to overwater succulents, but other than that, I like to think I have a decent green thumb. Best of luck with your wall of flora, Tyler.
we need a new video of you and hannah!!!
8 dislikes? Yesssssssss tylerrrrrr
Okay but are you dating
I have three plants and two of them are dying... i'm ashamed of myself
Indar is so cute it's literally painful to watch
i love plants sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!💕💕 i love tropical plants and also Aroids and some epiphytic plants
Plant life :)
I love plants 😍
Plant goals 🌱
Are Indar and Rhys still dating?
This video deserves so many more views
Love 🌿🌿🌿
Dar means house. It's an arabic word
It turned out so cute!!
I just bought a lucky bamboo that is dying. :/ i think it might be that i don't have filtered water. My poor baby
indar is my cousin y’all! i’m not even joking
BICEPS AND ABS!?!?!
A thousand thumbs up guys!!!🤩🤩
we love a green queen!!
Hope you have a green thumb and not a gangrene thumb 😄
Yess queen love Jesse from desperate housewives. I wouldn't mind having him on the side. Or better yet as the main meal
loved this video!
I’m in plant heaven!
Looks amazing! Those babies do need drainage holes in the pots though
I need more plants but cant have them bc if we have one they would die bc my mom cant take care of one
#LIVINGOAKLEY for this
Indar smile is too cute!!!!
Become a plant channel!
I have 320 house plants would never have it any other way!!
Cat daddy for a day?? Anyone??
that spider plant....#swoon
Who tf is behind the camera wtf
Ship
Does anyone know what garden center they went to?? Xx
They’re so cute together
omg and he's wearing a change shirt!!
phil is shook
Any time I see Indar I’m sooo happy! Fell in love with him in Kyle Kriegers little movie!! This just makes me happier!
Very distracted by Indar
I LOVE YOU
Those plants are all going to die from root rot within months because those pots don't have drainage holes. You can keep plants in the nursery pot until the roots grow out, a few years. Such a waste of beautiful plants!! Don't let them die please!
I can’t have plants on the ground because my rat of a dog chews on them 😩 I had the prettiest philodendron that my mum stupidly put on the ground and my dog tore up its big leaves
ahhhh so fine 💓
step #2: name your children
What happened with Indar and Rhys ?
I know you kinda alrighty did this but what if you became a student for a day?? I know you went to your college and high school for videos but what if you actually sat and listened
This was cute
💜
Omg desperate housewives is the best!
I sure hope they had holes on the bottom.. if u over water that soil is going to promote root rot and kill your plants.
Hi lysm xxxx.  U inspire me so much xxx
I’M SO JEALOUS IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL
Love this
LEATHER Daddy 😉
Love him.
Car Daddy
0:24 Tyler is shirtless at 0:24.
DANM is channel is dead
No one ever knows what desperate house wives is and it’s sad 😂 I wish it never ended
Super cute set up for your new green babies!
Sis, are you wearing makeup?
Why no drainage on any of the pots? If you’re a beginner... it’s really important!
can u please be a cat daddy and babysit hannah harts cats
Cool i have to try
INDAR IS SO SEXY 😍😍😍
omg yasss
a baby daddy
Dude just call is a day and end your channel. Your views are embarrassing seriously
Wow!! This is soooo cool!!! Omg!!! Love love love love!! :) :) :)
Be a reptile Daddy!! Get a reptile pet!! Would be adventurous and fun! Get a snake or crocodile or something.
Why can't you be a human daddy for a day? Find a friend with a baby and babysit!
iNDAR IS HANDSOOOOOOMMMEE!!! HAHA SO ARE YOU TYLERRRRRR!! (^_^)
naughty boy
Nice
gay
BEAU.TI.FUL. 😍😍😍
Being gay is a sin
this terrifies me, once i owned a cactus and i killed it. A CACTUS. YOU BARELY EVEN NEED TO WATER THOSE. i have a zeborah succulent plant now and i am TERRIFIED every day. and you're out here with 500 geez they would be all dead within a week if it was me.
Can you smell it? Something's rotting...

Oh yeah, the dead carcass of this channel. LOL.
flop
saw the thumbnail and lowkey screamed!! Hi Indar, i love you 💕 hope Rhys is good!
And two months later, everything dead.
your channel is dead m8
Tyler, leave Indar alone! That's Rhys' boyfriend!!!!!!!!!
Tyler: Ollie is my child and I love him 
2 minutes later 
Tyler: Which one's Ollie again? 😂
"hello jenna marble's dog" 
ahahaha so iconic 😂
"I probably love your dog more than I love you" 
God Tyler you're such a mood 😂
I feel like you need a dog
Did you see the gun show at 3:15
Dang, didn't know there was a gun show today!  Someone give Tyler some band aids cuz he's all cut up. 

I'll see myself out...
“this is anthony..... he’s never been in a video”
Dog almost choking on cupcake.
Tyler : "Same girl"
😂😂😂

Also pls make a video with Anthony! You 2 are so sweet
Tyler needs a dog for that backpack permanently.
uhmmmmm Ollie is the most well-behaved puppy i've ever seen?????? so chill and calm despite all of tyler hahha
Now THIS is the quality content I subscribed for
I read “becoming a dog for a day” and I thought you had filmed a collab with Watts the safeword
Skinniest French bulldog I’ve ever seen
Im-PAWS-ibly cute
Tyler get a corgi
You and a corgi would be the cutest thing
The first time I watched a Tyler Oakley video since 2016.. 
Hey, I love dogs too..  BUT WTF happend with your arms, where did all the muscles come from??.. respect 
Love you Tyler! ♥️
Just waiting for Tyler's next upload I rescued a puppy in which he rescues a puppy and pretty much does this except it's his dog. I would live for a queen who gets himself a fur baby. I love my fur baby Chewbacca!
Wait what? Since when you're ripped?
What have I missed the last 2 years?
Do you get more attractive every video???😻
STOP i really thought you got a dog
As a dog mom of two I 100% think you need a dog. When I bought my house my goal was to rescue as many dogs as possible and I got my first one and two months later I got another one... GET A DOG!!!
It's been a few years since I've seen a Tyler Oakley video... Where the hell did those muscles come from?!
Wow hes really well behaved in the bath- my dog squirmed and wriggled and jumped out and soaked me , the entire bathroom and house 😂😂
When will you get your own dog? Make sure you get a rescue dog 🐶 ❤️
Our very first #anthler moment on YouTube or is it #tylony?
I feel like this is exactly like when you leave kids with a relative for one night, they get over-excited and spoiled rotten, and then they come back home little nightmares :P
Tyler Oakley + Dog = The content I signed up for
You should just keep borrowing your friends dogs!
This is amazing Tyler Oakley, I'm also a BIG FAN OF YOU 😍😆 this dog is so adorable just like you!! 😘
Damn those arms...
Was there a dog in this video I thought I saw one?
Kinda feel like you need to do more vlog style videos
I read it as "Becoming a Dog for a day" and it was confusing 😁
I have an issue when Tyler says dog park because welcome to nightvale
Ummmm this might be your best video ever. Just saying!
You will be a good mother for puppy 😍💞
2:22 * immediately loses concern for the dog when he notices a cute guy *
"I've lost interest in the dogs, I've found interest in the gays"
😂😂 oh tyler,  you are such a mood
Holy crap!! Where is Tyler!! I can only see his arms and heads. Where is the rest of him!?!?
Get a dog, Ty! You had amazing chemistry with Ollie. Also, I loved Ollie's fox costume. He's so cute. Also, so are you. I love you! I love this video. I think this is my favorite video of 2019 so far.
This is your best ever video. More of Ollie, please.
dshjklafhadfhaf this video was so cute and pure and just we need more tylerxdog content
Awe Tyler you NEED a dog, this cuteness overload vid just proves it!! 😍😍😍🥰❤️❤️💞
Ok. So... I realise I'm behind the times but how ripped did you get?!!! :O Congrats!
I thought the title was "Becoming A Dog For Day" 🦖😂
Damn, Anthony can get it.
Ollie is so handsome. Loved the Vlog Tyler. ❤️❌⭕️❤️
I am obsessed with dogs, I want a thousand of them (not really). This video made me happy. :D
Aaaaaaaanthony!!! Has never been in a video xD He should though <3 <3
Also LOVED Anthony's cameo lol
So I haven't watched Tyler probably in about a year or so...he got ripped!
I love seeing you do more youtubey videos again :D We missed hanging out with you after you got so successful with all of your projects.
4:00 HAPPY LIL BOI
So this is one the first videos ive seen in a hot minute. And i knew tyler got hella fit, and like. I didnt know, that his biceps were THAT good. And now im feelin some type of way
Tyler is best dog uncle 

And ollies dad makes the uwu face
um that dog does not need to be on a "diet" you can see his ribs for pete's sake!
you....... got me way too excited. pls tell me you get an actual dog at some point in this video........
Someone has been hitting the gym!
that frapaccino moment was so cute 😭
Honestly Frenchies are my fav dogs, they are soo cute and portable
BICEPS!!!
ok so either Tyler is in an open relationship with Anthony or they're keeping it low key.
Deaf Hello Dog Hearth backpack nice ako ok 😅😘😎💪🏻🤟🏻👍🏻
Who else is obsessed with Tyler?! 😍





ps: if anyone wants to procrastinate, I also post videos 😳 crazzzy I know 😂
this right here !!!
Haven’t watched Tyler in a WHILE. When did he get buff?
You are so hot!
Ollie's poop after all those treats is gonna be wild.... did any other dog owners think that? Or is my dog just too tummy sensitive??
Ollie doesn’t need a diet he actually looks like he could afford to gain a few pounds.... you can see his ribs sticking out in quite a few clips.
the content I never knew i needed.....also...*cough*cough* Daannnn...Phiillll... have you seen TYLER's dog video....???
I lost it at "wait i've lost him. Is that Ollie?" 😂 I'm the same when I take my dog out sometimes but my gosh he's a monster when you give him a bath.
This whole video made me laugh!!
you should get dan and phil a dog
I need more of this content ASAP!!!
Hahaha doggy daycare
I think you brought a different dog from the dog park.
First time seeing Anthony on your channel I AM CRYING
Adopt me instead.  My name is already Anthony Jr., so I'd fit into the family perfectly!
You saw my tweet on twitter it honestly would make the perfect puppy father and I really hope one day of your ready to get a dog that would be the cutest ever. This video made my heart melt because of how you spoiled Ollie and took care of him it was so sweet. Also Ollie looks almost exactly like my grandparents dog Rex who I love very much :) ♥️
This is too cute! Id love to see you get a lil love pup
You would definitely make a great dog dad.  You definitely should get a dog.  And Ollie is adorable!!
This is just the constant mood of a dog owner, to be honest.
3:44 when is this fortnite backpack coming out ?
As a dog lover, I ADORED this video Tyler <333
Omg, I haven't seen a Tyler Oakley video in 2 years omg...
Thanks for this... now I gotta find a way to sneak a dog into my dorm... lol jk but I loved the video! You and Ollie are goals! Hope you both have a great week! xx
See ya later Korey Kuhl, Tollie are my new fave bff’s 👱🏻‍♂️🐶
Tyler: how ya feelin?

Dog: just stares

Tyler: i feel the same way
Such a wonderful video! Made me smile so much!!! Hope your doggy dreams come true ❤️. You'll be the best dog dad ever 🐶💕
Tyler, I can't believe you had a dog named, Ollie and it's so cute!!! ☺
What a gorgeous fit and in shape Frenchie <3
*interested*: Who's that gay?

Me every time an LGBT character shows up in a TV show or movie
giirl!! If you do get a dog I'd gladly fly out to L.A to groom him/ her for ya! lol (I groom dogs and work in a doggy daycare so no worries) Or if ya need tips, I have a hot handbag full of tips for your every need! :D <3
This was the cutest thing ever & I couldn’t stop looking at your arms 😍
Thanks for this Tyler ! I think we all needed this
“Spay and neuter your pets and Adopt only!” YES! Ily
Hi Tyler Oakley, this is everyone!
I love this video.
Tyler needs a dog! Also Ollie is adorable but thin!
Wow, puppy lived his best spoiled life that day.
get a dog! adopt don’t shop!
Wait...when did you get those muscles!!!
This is every day with a dog tbh 😂
I will never ever ever be as beautiful inside and out as Tyler Oakley and I’m not even mad at him. ❤️
I love Ollie. This video is all about Ollie. He is a good boy & we stan. But... OMG Anthony in a video!! Who ever thought I could get distracted from looking at a cute animal? Anthony did that.
Please get a dog
Ollie <3
this is my fav video ever
Can we meet Anthony?!?❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
my dog is also Ollie. I may have to find him that fox outfit, he loves clothes (I'm not just saying that, he literally begs by the cabinet that holds his sweaters and struts when he has one on)
I always gravitate to people's pets. I love animals and they judge me less than a lot of people. XD I love people's pets more than I love myself. So cute and fun. :3
I was not allowed to have a dog when I move to a place so I got a gaint rabbit instead. Her name is luna and she a gaint flemish rabbit and is amazing.
wholesome/10
Tyler Oakley is JACKED
❤❤❤❤🐕🐕🐕🐕🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
It’s a FRENSHIE!😍😍😍😍
I havent seen your videos in such a long time. And only clicked this one because of the dog.. so I guess I love dogs more than you :)
They are both so cute
Tyler neeeeeds a dog
BRO I THOUGHT THIS GUY WAS DEAD
be my dad for a day instead, even though the pupper is cuter
damn tyler's arm though.
It‘s a match 😍
Cute vid.... cuter doggie!😀👍❤
Ollie is so freaking cute, especially in that hat, and when did Tyler get so buff?!
Cute video. You spoiled him like an uncle.
YAS ANTHONYYYYYYY
i need that rainbow towel
This is the most pure and precious video on this website
This is the most wholesome video ever. I love it so much
Oh no. You didn't know rule #1 always take off the shirt before washing the dog
Anthony is soooo cute😍
This makes my heart so happy.
I have a frenchie too, his name is Kingsley 🖤
Love Tyler from Michigan here support you all the way man!
Lived for this. Def do more daily like blog videos (we still remember the "I will not do daily vlogs" comment) on a new account so the freaking algorithm does not bury them.
Tyler with a dog is to adorable for this world. 😄
Be prepared for lots of upper respiratory issues!
Now this is the type of content that I am HERE FOR
shes a well behaved frenchie, mine are hyper and spoiled
Damn. Been a while since I’ve seen your vids. And this channel has lost a lot 😦
#adoptdontshop
My new favorite VIDEO! 😂😍, I need my own dog now, get myself a Corgi
You definitely should get a dog.  it's the greatest feeling.  But for you I would suggest a smaller dog like Ollie.  You'd be a great Dog Dad. :-)
"Hey everyone, my name is Heather Oakley"
Now you'll hear it, too
my dog is cuter but it's FINE
Pls get a dog
the dog is So cute🥰💖💖
My new friend😘💖💖
Hes soooo cute
So stinkin cute
Wait, there was a dog in this video?
i can’t believe you invented arms
OMG!!! Loved the video, very vloggy style. And backpack for the dog, I LOVE IT! I need to get one for my boyfriend's dog
I could use it to travel around and it's perfect if you only have handbags
It must have been a special day for Ollie!!
糖尿病なっちゃいそうだけど(笑)
Come on muscles at 3:18! 2011 Tyler would never believe
Ok but can we talk about those guns 3:15 daaaamn boy! 😍💪
Love this video!
Idk about y'all but I am seeing massive bicep growth for Tyler at 0:33 growing up with him (online) and seeing this physical growth. Quite literally... kodos to u Tyler. Whatever you're doing for your physical health! keep it up!
Um Nathan is daddy.
You should do a buying everything my dog touches with olly like Nicole Skyes did
Tyler’s like the grandma that spoils their grandchildren rotten with treats lmao 😂
Omg this video is everything!! 😂❤️👏
YAS I'M FIRST!!
Holy crap, that is a cute dog. 🥰😍
Wait. You cant look at cute gay people if you have a bf? lol
Tyler reminds me of Viktor Nikiforov from Yuri on ice 😍
Ive seen you on the TV show: The Amazing Race
Honey the muscles are out to play today haha
Omg favorite video ❤️🥰💙
You oppressed the dog by dressing it up in gendered costumes.
my new all time favourite video <3
gasp It's a French Bull Dog!  I love small dogs, although I am going to put off getting one because of living with my roommate's dog who tears up shoes and other leather things when I'm gone.  Jeff, the dog, is an ESA, but he is incredibly attention hungry when his owner has to leave him at home.
Literally, everything Tyler described about being a "dog dad" is what I feel about being a "cat mom" whenever I see pictures of people's cats.
Well my dogs Brian and Kevin will probably love you more than me lls , and PS- your Arms are distracting me😉🥰🥰🥰💋 keep looking good babe
Work for a wildlife park and we do the same thing with our bears food...😂😂
last time i was this early pinof was still a thing🥵
Tyler + DOG = 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 

But still TYLER IS A SNACK
Lol, I actually stan this video, great work Tyler
We occasionally dogsit a family friends shiba inu. I tweeted a few picture of her at you on twitter, DreamingOnMyOwn is my username. ;)
Yeah love dogs
We love our pets so much I named my brand after one of them 😂
I read "becoming a dog for a day" and thought OMG he actually did it. he actually is a furry.
OMG hellllooooo there....💪😍3:13-3:20 come one Mr. Flex haha
just looked back three years ago, every video is about 2m or more, now can barely brake 100k, that is 5% of the views you used to get lol
reading "becoming a dog for a day" like chiiiiill tyler...there are limits to this love
You have such a beautiful dog!! Have a great day!
literally just read the title of the video. okay fair.
I'm living for the homage to that scene in Empire Strikes Back where Luke Skywalker carries Yoda on his back
3:51 i had a moment like “OMG mah doggy loves those too!”
Greetings from London, dude you are looking sexy I'm just sayin. Cheers all the best
You two are adorable. 
Love love love 💕
I don't have a dog but always wanted one.😣🤣😅😀😎
Ollie is the cutest.. like are you kidding?! 😫💛
This is video number 2 with a JoJo Siwa reference please keep it going😂😂
Ollie's adorable 😍 I thought Ollie was Tyler's dog. I didn't know he was the Godfather
I’ve had a DAY and this honestly made me smile a bit so thanks 💙💙
Tyler... you just get more and more handsome!
DREAM VIDEO / DAY!! Love you!!
Tyler will pin this if he loves his fans
Frenchies are the cutest
you’re so adorable ily💓
Tyler I kind of think you need to go get a dog right now, create an Instagram page for the pup for us to follow and a daily pup blog because omg watching you with this puppy is making my heart grow like 10 times bigger
‘Jenna Marbles dog’ 😂
Oh Tyler you so need a dog.
101th like my birthday is this thursday
I think you had a great time with the dog and the dog enjoyed it too as he was so pampered. I think Ollie appreciated the pampering and the experiences too.
oh my goodness U HAVE TO GET A DOG
This is paw-sibly the best content of 2019 😌❤️🐾
I was so nervous with the dog on your back 😂😂😂he looked like he was gonna tip over
Frenchies are the best! 💕 Wish mine had a friend
this video is my new favorite from you SO CUTE!!!!
Just wait until I get my corgi and then you'll really see how good I am at being a "corgi mom."
What a new video trend of Tyler's.
Why is the dog walking you?
I am a simple man . I see a dog in the thumbnail I click .💖💖💖
ouch he just missed the 10 min mark
Is Nathan single? I'm just saying, I'm 100% okay being a stepdad to Ollie
You should puppy sit my Ollie next LOL

“hello jenna marbles dog” me 😂🤣

A frenchbulldog😍😍
This is so pure and wholesome
My sister got a cat and at first, she was gonna name him Oakley, but now he's Ares 😑
Lol straight people have that same urge for a dog too 
Sincerely, a mommy of a 3 yr old pitbull
Firstable, when did Tyler get so jacked!? Secondly, freakin' ADORABLE.
I’m living for this vlog style
As someone who has two dogs, having a pet (let alone two) is a COMMITMENT...but I still fully support you having a dog. 🐶
I feel he sometime looks like Adam Levine, anyone?
so I'm a girl named Raven...with a blind doggie you should love too! i wrapped her for a video...where she proceeded to walk into and knock over the camera. love this!!!
Tyler is cute. Ollie is cute. This video cuteness overload.
7:48 CMON BODY 😍
With one video Tyler has turned my cold dead cat person heart into a warm loving dog person heart
3:03 is exactly how I bathe my dog
60,000 views after THREE days??  He used to rake in millions of views.   Wow, RIP Tyler Oakley's YouTube channel.
THIS IS THE CUTEST
Tyler is in dog dad modus :D
are you taking steroids ?
I LOVE this video
Almost a pug. So im liking the video
OMG SO PRECIOUS
You remind me so much of mark from rent
So thats how a dead channels looks.
Wait....u were checking out guys....does that mean ur single?
OMG I want a Frenchie so bad how cuuuute!
Tyler I swear to God if you do not get a dog now you're so cute as a dog Mommy
Yep, the white one looks like mine 😂
this whole video is such a mood
Pete Buttigieg is running for president
Is this video even real?
u are adorable:)))
ok tyler you goal for 2019 is to get a damn dog
3:19 okay dad
If Tyler would own a dog, the dog would become the fattest dog in the world. And I would love that for him.
The dog is cute but Anthony tho
the fact you have the dog strapped into the car is killing me
So cuuuute!!
yassssss
God!! I love dogs so much too. I adopt 3 girls and they're so amazing and make me so happy 💖💓 You have to adopt one!!
My dogs would be going insane
Please collab with Miranda sings again that was so funnyyyyy
I love your videos so much
Will this video get subtitles?
that is not a face of a happy bulldog
I was watching a video on the decline of Tyler Oakley's fame and it seems right. This video has been up two whole days, and it's gotten what can barely scrape 53,000 views. Of the 7.5 MILLION, that's FIVE ZEROS BEHIND IT (7,500,000)!!!
That means, if my math is correct, only about 0.706666666% of his user base is even interacting with his content, and the percentage of likes is even smaller (0.064%), but nothing compared to the truly depressing, infinitesimal amount of comments, (which, at the time I'm writing this, is just under 370), meaning just a 0.004933333% of his base has anything to say in response to his content.
And given his production quality, and the fact that this seems to be his only job, so also tacking on his living expenses, he must be hemorrhaging money... 
It's just so sad to see him fall, even if we all saw it coming.
You totally need a dog!
I love you Tyler
I am #crying I want to get a Frenchie so bad and this is not helping my frenchie fever 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ollie I’m in love with you
Fun Fact! Some shelters let you "foster" a dog for a day or weekend to help relieve the stress of being in a kennel. It's a great way to be a dog parent for a day or two, and also help out a dog in the process!
Be aware of the dog
Scrappy-Doo? Is that you?
ANTHONY. <3
ollie eating the cupcake, aw
So cute! You’d be the best dog dad.
Wow your channel is dead
THAT ARM TYLER 3:15 YASSS
Awwww
OLLIE IS SO CUTE OH MY GOSH
Tyler please get a dog
that dog needs to gain weight tbh
hello dog content
ollie looks naked during his bath lmao
Ollie is too cute
that dog is too thin
You need a dog
I’m only watching this for the dog content! Tyler who?
Ooooo that guy at the dog park 😍😍😍
Where is his shirt
Hes so muscular
Your channel is dead
I love Dogs too.
You should get a pug
i love dog dads
Oh my dog, the puppy backpack!!! 😱😍🐕🐕🐕

Stop naming your dogs after me.
😍😍😍😍😍
Me with dogs

AGHHHHHHHHH
Yup
Frenchie is my dream dog!!!!!! 💙❤️💜💙❤️💜
Tyler dogs can’t get lice they can get fleas but not lice
Incredible.
First he likes men, then he likes dogs, what comes next? Horses? Guys protect your animals and yourself.
dead channel
uh who’s anthony?
Hi
I really want a Frenchie but I’ve read they have a ton of health problems that I can’t afford
arm vein
❤️❤️
why are there so less clicks?!
Just visiting a grave of a dead channel
so you’re telling me that Ollie didn’t get to do a runway to show his dad his new outfits??!
Dead channels
Tyler PLEASE be aware of what breed you're getting. French bulldogs like Ollie are the MoST unhealthy dog :( they can't even give birth without human intervention. You have influence on what dog breeds other people will gonna get, please think hard about it!
Awesome that you had a Japanese guy on your video. This is the second video of yours that I’ve watched and I’m glad it’s about dogs ‘cause I’ve always said I like dogs more than peeps. 😁
Pete Buttigieg could be first gay man elected President. peteforamerica.com
This dog is spoiled af now
I thought this guy quit YouTube.
Sorry but Ollie is way under weight should not see spin and ribs tell owner to get that checked out
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii tylerrrrrrr
peteforamerica.com.
I am waiting for you to do a video with a kitten or young cat.
I'm gonna explode!!!
Dog is God. Just spelled backwards.
Of course you had to get the stereotypical dog breed of gay couples.
Dude, same tho. Dogs are everything. Sadly my parents are allergic so I never had one. But i hyped all my friends dogs and still am. 😄
THE MOST ICONIC DUO IS BACK AT IT IN 2019!!! 💗
ouch that’s my heart
#mamriebakeitup
I need to go to Tyler’s gym
Jacob Sagittarius coming through




Edit: holy crap never gotten this many likes
If Shawn Mendes would ever touch me specially at the gym where he is obviously all sweaty, I would pass out on the spot. Like how did you not make a whole video just about that. I need all Shawn and Tyler’s meet ups at the gym
Omg! Congrats on Shawn complimenting you! 🥂
mamrie's references are killing me! I love when you two do videos together!!
“Your Midwest is showing” 😂
"Here are the men of our dreams... who are just now learning cursive"

TYLER I CANNOT
Love that mamrie can't not show her true feelings. Lmao the JoJo annoyance was great.
the life u live seeing shawn mendes at the gym omg
TYLER AND MAMRIE CONTENT TYLER AND MAMRIE CONTENT TYLER AND MAMRIE CONTENT
to the tune of camp takota “bake bake bake it up bake bake bake bake it up”
2 legends? i'm here for it
“Your Midwest is showing” 😂😂 so relatable
Okay but if Shawn Mendes came up behind me, rubbed my shoulders and complimented me I would probably melt right into the floor and I am a grown ass man but damn Shawn Mendes is probably the most beautiful specimen to walk this earth
Tyler, what gym do you go to? I need to know for a science project (called Meeting Shawn Mendes)
I love u guys so much , the OGS of Youtube
im 2 minutes in and im already dying of laughter
mamrie is a literal mood
oh god I didnt realize how much I missed you two collabing
I seriously NEED to know what gym Tyler goes to where he sees Shawn Mendes tbh
OMG. I'm moving to LA. I want Shawn Mendes to touch me!!!😍😍
I laughed way too hard at this.
More of this! When are we getting the This Might Get/ Psychobabble host swap? I need this combination on one of the podcasts. Thanks! Okay Bye!
The Elton John Jojo Siwa thing has me CRYING laughing
I just love how 3/4 of the board is Jojo Siwa. ^^
Queen of hiding her bangs is here #Mamriebakeitup
Siwa later Tyler😂
wow gettin hit on by Shawn is theee dream
I 100% stan for Tymrie....I need to meet you both at some point, because I relate to you guys infinitely
Tyler! Where did you get your sectional couch from? I'm looking for a new one and that's exactly what I want! LOL
saw Shawn... had to watch
omg, yass, I love your videos, highlight of the day （〜^∇^)〜
#mamriebakeitup
I love Mamrie's random obscure anecdotes that get triggered by things like "tiger heat"
TYMRIE IS BACK OH MY GOD
psychobabble spoiled some of this for me lmao we love jojo
These two together are always pure gold omg 😂😂😂😂😭❤️
i love how he just casually said yea i see shawn at the gym all the time
CNCO made it into a Tyrie video. I don’t know what to do with my emotions.
Tyler talking about Bingo Boppers 
“Your Midwest is showing.”
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I died of laughing
9:16 KILLS ME bc the piece mamrie sets down literally just says “JOB”
OMG, mames knows about Hanson still being around and their beer!!??? She’s my favourite!!
Mamrie has big horse girl energy.
Omg I love CNCO (you say each letter individually)
i love my parents So much holy frick
Havent watched you in a minute Tyler, just wanted to say nice guns like REALLY nice #glowup
You guys NEEEED to do more collabs together. OH OH OH ORRRR grace and mamrie OR ORRRRR grace mamrie anddd Hannah. All you guys together are straight PERFECTION 😍
Straight up outing Shawn Mendes I love it
“I see Shawn Mendes at the gym all the time.”
“What kind of rich f*cking gym do you go to?”
Lol exactly what I was thinking 😂😂 
“He is a hottie.”
“I know!”
Also what I was thinking. 😂😂😂
The Reuben joke from Mamrie was 10/10
We need more collabs with great people coughdanandphilcough
considering i watched the birds and the bees video before i got actual sex ed, so much of this is still so on point and hysterically funny. glad you'll be around for my college days :)
Rolf vs Mamrie, the next ksi vs Logan Paul
jeez every single video from Tyler makes me as happy now as they used to back in 2013.  Man,  I've been here for a loong time.
"this is his actually height" haha all the shade in this was amazing! Tamrie collabs are the best <3
Can’t wait to read more about “Rolf Santorini”!! 🤣🤣🤣
TYLER HOW DID YOU NOT PASS OUT WHEN SHAWN COMPLIMENTED YOU LIKE OOF
Hey Tyler I love you video so much you’re the one that make me have a smile on face when I am battleing from depression anxiety disorder and I hope you have a wonderful day
Okay but like why is this something I would do
im only 2 minutes in and im already laughing so much
I think mamire and shane should do a video together honestly like idk if anyone else thinks that... . . ... but like. 2019 vibes. Please god let them colab. Shamire. I need it.
Tyler what level are you in Pokémon go??!
Can you please remake the Edward 50 Hands video together??!
Mamrie‘s outfit is everything! ☺️
#mamriebakeitup
🤣🤣🤣 OMG I was dying of laughter the whole video!! So many good moments! You guys are PERFECT together!! 🤩
Anyone looking for the JohnJohn Siwa-Elton photo, just look up 'Jojo Siwa wearing colored glasses' and it should be in the image results.
I think I'm late to say this but...
YOU WERE FAB ON CATFISHHHHH
At this point, who doesn't Tyler see at the gym
JoJo was on the cover of Bake it Up Magazine May 2018. Mamrie can do it! 😂
Yes! Bone, thugs in harmony!!!
"your midwest is showing" I can confirm that no one here in MI says "dopper" Tyler im not sure where you got that
I love my parents so much <3
Okay, this hilarious. Off to a good start 2019, keep 'em coming! Love ya, Mamrie and Tyler. ^^

P.S.: Please make this a series! I want it sooo bad. :D
Sorry I'm late. I was watching interviews of Michelle Obama
I saw "vision boards" and thought of the Troyler AU "Freak"
mamrie never knowing who that picture of jojo is has me CACKLING
I only clicked because I saw WDW in the thumbnail. 🍋💡
Just got done listening to Psychobabble- headed over here right away💓
Best collab duo of all time!!! Immediately clicked! ❤️

YASSS TYLER YASSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!! #MamrieOakley comin' back at ya with another video
I’m starting a new life. A new school, in a new city and my vision board is just making the most of all the new opportunities that may come my way.
Amazing! You guys are two of my favorite Youtubers. I needed the laugh today.
I keep coming back to this video because I love you both sm. ICONIC.
Omg! I'm LIVING for this😻
You're so inspiring! I love you so much!!!❤
Yahhhh bone thugsssssss. Cleveland represent ❤️💙💜
"The only Reuben I know has sauerkraut on it!" LOL 💋 💋
watching you two together is like injecting happiness directly into my heart
I haven’t watched Tyler’s channel since he was 24 and how he’s 29 and I feel like I’m 50 even though I’m 18
Came straight from the podcast!! Getting my Tyler Oakley fix today!! 🥰
I can relate to the JTT shrine so much. My room was plastered with his face.
I LOVE GRACE AND MAMRIE! Listened to every episode of their new podcast This Might Get Weird :)
Rolf Sagittarius...
God I love Mamrie.
Please make more videos together! I love your collab videos. Also, #mamriebakeitup
The Elton Siwa part almost killed me 🤣
Obsessed with this combo. Mamrie is LITERALLY my spirit human. Tyler is joy.
YES YES YES, this is what my 2019 needed. More Tyler and Mamrie videos!!
Sister James should find out where that gym is 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who clicked on this video because they saw Why Don't We in the thumbnail? #limelights
Well my duck IS a butterfly
MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE DUO IS BACK! I NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THIS!
#BakeItUpMamrie
Love the video! Can you please make the background music quieter?
If you see this comment tell me the best part of your day !!! <3
I also used to frequent Tiger Skeeze (as we called it 😂) when I was underage. Britney night. 💕
Every time I watch these two collab YouTube thinks I want to watch “Ya Busted” and it is never wrong. 


If you know. You know.
the fact that mamrie called him "jacob sagittarius" likely unironically kills me
I'm really loving these OG collabs.
shawn complimented you wow wish i could relate
LaurDIY is quacking
7 likes and I will do extremely risky flips in public then upload it right now
OK, I just went from the "Ya Busted" video to this. And I've also been out of touch with YouTube. So...

When did Tyler become this buff fitness guy? 😲 As if I didn't feel insecure enough 😅
Nothing makes me happier than a Tyler&Mamrie video!! 😂😂
I love Tyler and Mamrie together!
When you haven't seen Tyler in a hot min and hes beef cake?? Ok boi!!
OMG ITS MY GAY HUSBAND -Miranda Sings
the perfect duo!
I missed you together ♥️
I had an entire wall of JTT posters.😂😂😂
Shawn Mendes confirmed gay AND in love with tyler
omggg tyler ilysm my insta is @thatonegirl055
I laughed so hard through this entire video. Very much appreciated it as someone who was born before the year 2000 😂
Y’all are just precious beams of sunshine. Love you.
This is a great project,I am going to do the same thing! Are you in the magazine's? You should be! I had JTT in my room too & I also had Hanson posters.
“Tigerheat”  😂😂 omg. The children of WeHo come out on Thursday nights hahahaha
This video made my day. I’ve been so sick all day and to watch this and laugh for the first time today is amazing
Am I the only that freaked about why don't we on the front of the magazine
I can't relate to going through a magazine and knowing some people in it 😂
I missed this duo omg
"A BINGO BOPPERR??"!
Mamrie was looking at a magazine that said VISION BOARD in big letters lol
ROLF
Did not see that coming or did Nazi that coming, Mamrie?
hilarious. they look so much fun to hang out with I would love to be their friends hahah idk if that’s weird or not 😂
wow seeing shawn everyday at the gym. WOW LuCkYyYyY 🥵🥵🥵
ok but i literally used to make boards of cut-outs from these magazines ALL THE TIME back then when i was a teenager what a throwback
I haven’t watched Tyler in like over a year and wtf when did he...become Tyler 2.0??? And mamrie???? I’ve been gone too long
Idk you anymore 😂, I’m kidding, I still love you 😚😂💛
this video will be demonetized by morning if it hasnt been already. i love y'all
okay but I kinda want a JoJo Mamrie Tyler collab
Bingo Dobbers. What a relatable reference.
Tyler and JoJo Siwa collab next?
Tyler has literally met so many amazing people, like damn, he is living the dream!
Wait when did Tyler become zaddy
My favourite duo in YouTube history ♥️
Can one of you get Hanson on your channel? Flula had them on his podcast semi-recently and it was great :)
Tyler can be my Teen Magazine pinup anyday! 😝😘
ima need another edward fortyhands collab from you two
Truly an amazingly funny duo. Haven’t laughed out loud at a YouTube video like this until now. Thanks guys! Keep collabing
Y'all collabing makes me feel like a 14 year old stan wearing my "I can't stop watching YouTubers" sweatshirt again
I never realized just how funny Mamrie is, I'm headed over to her channel now to binge.
WHY DO I NEVER GET NOTIFIED?!?!?! DAMMIT!
Wait who did Tyler have beef with at Katsuya
Does anyone feel likes this is an reupload?? I have so much dejavus.
THEY ARE BACK #TAMRIE 2019!!!!
patiently waits for Tyler to find an article about Dan and Phil and makes plenty of sex jokes about it

Realizes that Dan and Phil aren't relevant to today's tweens anymore
i mean, to be fair to mamrie, first thing i thought of when i saw CNCO was "...why is it spelled like JNCO??" so.
I can’t even with you two! You need to collab more often! You always make me smile! Keep spreading the love!!!!
Y'all never fail to put a smile on my face 💖
Who else scrolled straight to the comments 😂

Anyone wanna be youtube friends 😊
"he came up behind me" MAMRIE'S FACE
The Elton John comment had me laughing so hard...and i'm on the bus!
You guys don't even have to do anything. Just talk all. Day. PLEASE!
i always love y’all videos together SO much
I love both of you!! Tyler let’s do a video together!!!
"if you put that on mine it would mean, I want children" hahahha touché
Tyler and Shawn collab , again ? I think so ....
I couldn't stop laughing XD
This is cracking me up😂
I'm in my late twenties and honestly y'all are the most relatable content on YouTube. I would watch hours of complaints about the youths and Hanson references.
If I made a vision board, I would have Tyler on it for his infectious positivity. And that cackling laugh!
All I see is JoJo Siwa all over that poster🤣🤣
This is so funny IM DYING
The Giggolos have reunited #ICP yess
10:44 you missed the perfect opportunity to say “if you’re jojo siwa don’t jojo sue us”
Who even is jojo siwa? I've seen so many youtubers talk about her but I've no idea who she is
Tyler's arms though! 😍😍😍
I love how JoJo Siwa takes up a solid 80% of the board
I got way too excited when I heard Hanson has their own beer. In 2019 I will try mmmhops.
I only came here because I read about the Shawn Mendes gym story on tumblr but now I'm sad they didn't know CNCO :(
I remember when i went on holiday to the us for the first time like 8 years ago I bought some of those magazines too and i was so excited bc i wanted to have american teen mags. 😂
I love that mamrie just had a friend who worked at a tiger sanctuary I just aspire to live her life
the videos i miss of you! ill start watching again if you give me this
6:40 Tyler trying to explain Bingo Dabbers is iconic omg
4:50 and 8:05 - 8:14 Peep Why Don't We <3 <3
i can watch this duo for days
There is a club in dayton oh that is for like 16 and up. Tragic!!
I THOIGHT THIS WAS ELTON JOHN
#mamriebakeitup 😂😂
i LOVED this. very youtube in 2014 esque
Mamrie, drink it up!

Stop scrolling for a sec ✋





I recently uploaded a new song. Tell me what u think 💯

#mamriebakeitup
#mamriebakeitup
Everyone I si-wa 😂
i've missed these kinds of videos so much you have no idea
I want your why don’t we poster so you should mail it to me ❤️
crazy how I rmb watching your vision board video from years ago (the 2012 one w korey in it) when I was still a student trying to figure life out, and here we are, both being better versions of ourselves.
Who was that person they said there was drama with?!? Kim jacks?
I just wanna know who they had that weird moment with
I was cry laughing for most of the video. Oh I thoroughly enjoyed this.
8:05 THE AUDACITY TO NOT APPRECIATE MY BOYS😔✊
We stan legends
Waiting for that first issue of Tiger Heat to drop 🐯
That BTNH shiiiiiirt!  Tylah, I need it in mah life!
I love y'all. Y'all are great.
#MamrieBakeItUp
Tyler Oakley and Mamrie Hart are the best.
Omg I just marked out with him wearing a bone thugs n harmony shirt ...I love bone thugz
Mamrie shading Jacob Sartorious for 11 minutes
I am here for the JNCO reference thank you
omg i can’t stop laughing 😂😂😂
LOVE THESE TWO
I thought it was elton john too!
Uhhhh Tyler put those guns awaaaayy oh my lawwwd 😍😍😍😍😍
if you did a shot of the table the video would look much more cooler and you guy don't have to lift up you books to show the viewers :)
Had no idea Mamrie was a Hanson stan but it’s giving me the warm fuzzies.
she’s early today!!
I forgot he existed lmao
This bois channels dying
I have never felt more elderly as a 23 year old 🤯
Hey Ty love you lots💕 My insta is oliviacicarelli12
BEEF W/ ROLF!
I missed these two.
OMG Mamrie and Tyler!! I can't even...😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
their collabs are always my favorite videos
you slay queen!! 🙌🙌
Love you Tyler ❤️
My fav collab of all time! #Tymrie !!
Oh god. I never laugh as hard as I do when these two are in a video together. “Here are the men of our dreams who are just now learning cursive...”
The dream team lmao y'all make me laugh harder than anyone I swear
Ok honestly clicked this video because why don’t we was on the cover
this made my heart happy
YAAAAYYY. My favorite videos are when you two fabulous idiots get together.
Love ur vids Tyler
Why did I read that as "with only tween mames"😂😂😂
my god I missed you guys together
Brain Implan all the way! 😂
i completely lost my shit when mamrie confused jojo siwa with elton john
I once asked my Aunt how old she thought Millie Bobbie Brown was, and she genuinely guessed 30/40ish. XD
Tiger Heat?!? 🐅
I see Tyler Oakley and I see Mamrie hart #ICONIC2019
#MAMRIEBAKEITUP LETS GOOOOOO
“I don’t wanna even touch that game, next”
One of my most favorite favorite collab duo’s ever!! Not only, do I laugh, the whole damn time, but Mamrie and I are around the same age, so rarely I get somebody I watch that I get their references! ( honorable mention to Tyler’s Bone-thugs-N-Harmony t-shirt that also takes me back to when I was a kid... before iTunes and cd’s, when I wanted to have a copy of the song I liked on MTV (right...aged me even more!) I would take our large ass VHS sized voice recorder and hold it up to the speaker on the tv and record it 😂 , mind you I was still pretty young yet... so never had more than my like $5 a week allowance...so that was the only way for me to listen to it.... kids these days just don’t understand the struggle.... ) ok... that happened......😑 shhh 🤫 don’t tell anybody....
never stop making youtube videos
Oml just watched it love it so much 💗
Love this duo 💕💕💕
The hilarious thing is that Jojo Siwa is like 6 feet tall. #tinydancer
I NEVER WANT IT TO END OH MY GOD
Tearing up laughing. #mamriebakeitup
I am scared of how old mamrie and Tyler look now, we are all getting old.
I don’t know why I love this so much, but I do.
i came for sean mendez on the thumbnail
bro, u dead?
It’s a bingo dobber, not a dopper haha! :)
It’s a bingo dauber. My Midwest is showing too!
my favorite duo!!!!
#mamriebakeitup
#mamriebakeitup
He’s alive !!!
I love the video you and mamrie do together
I’m PACKED ITS BEEN A WHILE WITH THE MAMES
TYLER, WHERE IS DARREN??
Sober Mamrie is sounding a lot like Drink Mamrie.
Hahah you're awesome, 😏😶
This video was SO FUNNY
i’m a minute in and it’s already too much.
Mamrie looking like a CRISP lesbo and we are all here for it.
Lmk why I’m about to wake up MY ENTIRE house LAUGHINGGGGGG
QUEEEEEEEEEENSSSSS😍😍😍
You live together?
I want Tyler's shirt.
elton johnjo siwa
This hit me right in the giggle bone
#MamrieBakeItUp
All the gesticulating with scissors is scaring me. Vision board injuries are real.
The men of our dreams who are just learning cursive loloololol
little dancer? jojo is 5ft11
Tyler, I can't believe you got a lot of teen magazines with Marie Hart about celebrities in the entertainment industry!!
I love this so much!
This is awesome! Also, Milo Manheim was in the Disney movie Zombie’s and a finalist on the last season of  DWTS.
this is awesome!
PRETTY SURE WE NEED ANOTHER EDWARD 40 HANDS!!
Excuse meeee I saw the Dolan twins on the cover of a mag but none on the vision board I’m offended! 😂💕🤭
What happened to his channel?
It makes so happy that some youtubers are going back to collabs. I miss the days when 2 of our favorite youtubers would get together and just laugh and have fun instead of how toxic youtube seems to be now with all the copyright claims and channel strikes. Youtube used to be a place of other creators supporting each other but now it's like survival of the fittest or something. I hope we see more creators collabing again soon!
Omg, you guys are awesome!!
#mamriebakeitup
Looks like i'm picking up a bunch of rando mags to make a vision board out of this weekend. Thanks yall. :)
She's f-ing hilarious
I swear she’s aging backwards, the woman is glowing recently
This is so cute, you to Tyler you to
♪ "WOOoo woo!" ♫
Hi mom & dad
Did anyone else know that Tyler was on fear factor ??? He did soooo well
Is the background music the instrumental to “Come Get It Bae”?
I am loving the purposeful avoidance of sexualizing these teens

5:33 is jacob saggyclitoris
#mamriebakeitup here for this
Is Jacob the next beiber
Neither of you can sing, but this vision board thing looks like fun to do... nothing I could do.  I freeze up the minute I am forced to focus on myself, as I already know how miserable/in transit I am and have not found my "ideal me" yet.
2:37 the way he throws the scissors down haha
Who's the person with the weird moment at Tyler's birthday? Anyone know?
i love this video!!!!! made me laugh so hard!!!!!!

I can’t believe I watched this cringe fest
give this video a LIKE if you're gonna be along for the ride in 2019!!
also... what are YOUR goals for the year?? GET SPECIFIC!! comment below!!

MAKE SURE YOU'RE SUBSCRIBED: https://www.youtube.com/tyleroakley?sub_confirmation=1
my hopes in 2019:

- to get a bf or gf (lmao the most unrealistic)
- meet you possiblyyyy
-get my driving license 
- be happy most of the time
- get good grades and get into university 
- more concerts!!
- get a tattoo :)
- eat healthier/ less snacking
"I'm your Vegas baby."-Tyler, Yasssssss Queen!!!!!
My goal is to try and get out of the depressed circle that my life is and help my mental health
Dear 2019,
This year, I don't want to stop. I don't want to stop being ambitious and going outside my comfort zone. I don't want to stop smiling and having fun because of anxiety. I don't want to stop being authentic because of other people's opinions of me. I don't want to stop shining when it gets dark or when people complain about the light. 2019, this year, I started not stopping.
For the 1% of people who see this if you would hit that like button it would make my day👍🏻I hope you a bright and good future, I am a youtuber myself and  I’m not asking you to do anything but I would love to grasp 10000 😊💙
THANK YOU
Once you feel comfortable, I'd love to see a boyfriend tag video with your bae, Tyler.  Drag queens are so much fun, so I am on board with wanting to watch/participate in more drag videos.  More tattoos, more writing and more collab videos... get to it, girl, along with throwing the opening pitch for a baseball game.
NOTIF SQUAD WYA?





btw im a small youtuber :)
I wanna lose 50 pounds😁
EDIT: 4 weeks later and I've lost 8!!
You’re “issue” with writing is my issue with everything in my life
my goal for 2019 is to stop anxiety controlling me and taking over my life. i also want come out to my parents this year x
HAPPY NEW YEAR TYLER❤️❤️
My goals for 2019 are: getting a pet because I‘ve been having a lot of panic attacks lately and it‘s actually scary. Finally be happy because people always tried to drag me down and especially the last two years really destroyed my self esteem so i hope it won‘t happen this year. I wanna work/ study something that i love which is design. I‘m a creative person and I know it‘s the only thing that makes me happy. I need to be stronger amd 2019 and believe in myself. Also I want to support the people that i love and care about. Love you tyler ur one of them❤️
My main goal of 2019 is to make sure that I appreciate all the little things in life, all of the daily tasks and small conversations that I have but forget about  the next day. Two years ago I was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and, although it’s not cancerous or anything, I was terrified. They said if it grew that it could have serious effects. However in December they said that it hasn’t grown in about six months, which doesn’t sound like a big deal, but it is to me. It means that I will be able to go to Northeastern and take the steps I need to become an elementary school teacher. It means that I will be able to meet the man of my dreams and have a family of my own one day. But it also means that I can have endless mindless conversations and do thousands more loads of laundry and hug my mom a million more times, and it means that I can appreciate every one of them.
Amazing and long list of things you want to do. You got this!
The three biggest things on my list are:
1. More adventures with my family
2. Write more
3. Take better care of my body
Is he still living?
OMFG TYLER COME TO SOUTH AFRICA AS ONE OF YOUR 10 COUTIRES (also like Durban is the place to be if you come we can go swim with the dolphins)
Good grades 

Get better at makeup

Love myself

Have more empathy 

Be nicer

Meet you
“Anybody wants pretzels?” YES, I’d be the first person to raise my hand 😂😂😂

My goals idk lol:
1. Talk about my feelings more I guess lol
2. Stop hiding and be myself more at home(if I can)
3. Make my boyfriend comfortable cause he’s always getting sick and in some more of pain 
4. Call the bank for a new card 😂
my goal for this year is to take my self into consideration, all of my life i have put others before myself which is something that ive felt super proud of but now its taken an affect on my mental health. sometimes i feel like im drowning in other people's problems and no one can ever really see that because ive gotten so good at hiding how i am truly feeling. 

so i would love to find a way to be able to continue supporting other people but at the same time support myself and my mental health.
My goals for 2019 are:

⚡️get better grades
⚡️be more outgoing 
⚡️make new friends
⚡️get off my goddamn phone
⚡️do things on time
⚡️read more books
I heard if you’re early he’ll pin your comment ....
he still makes videos?
❤️❤️❤️❤️ you’re my favorite!  I’m gonna make 2019 amazing too! (I’m getting married in a month... EEEEK!)
How do people wear turtle necks without being turned on all day from being choked??
Happy new year Tyler 😘 Can't wait to see all the things you accomplish this year 😘❤️ my goal for 2019 is to come out to my ENTIRE family because I've came out to some but not everyone knows so

My goals for 2019, go back to school again.

4) Go on my first day with a guy!!!! (I’ve been out since 2014, and even though I’ve been talking to people and texting people, I haven’t really been on a date. Once I feel better about myself, I’ll give it a try, and I have to try in 2019)
5) I wanna read more this year 
6) I want to compliment my friends and loved ones more. It’ll spread positivity, and there’s no reason why I shouldn’t do this. 

The fact that I’m sharing these goals publicly right now is so terrifying, but as you said, I need to manifest them and actualize them. Hope it works.
Good luck with your goals everyone 💖
My goals for 2019:
- continue being grateful for my family and all that I have
- continue crushing it at university 💪🏼
- pay more attention to my health and build my immunity back up
- be more tolerant and patient with people who lack maturity and sense
- continue seizing every opportunity and putting myself out there and taking initiative!!
- push myself to be more social and meet people and make more friends (maybe even a boyfriend? Who knows) 
- spend more time with my family when I go home during vacations 
- finally get around to starting a blog or YouTube channel to share my experiences as an international uni student studying in London 💖
My biggest New Years resolution is to watch less Netflix, I want to live my life more and not watch other people live theirs! 

2nd, I want to keep working on my happiness, I love my life and everything I do, I just want to make sure I keep focusing on that. 

3rd, I want to be better at giving compliments, because you never know if what you say will make or break someone’s day! 

Good luck on your goals Tyler! Can’t wait to see your progress! 😍

Hey Tyler Oakley My New Year’s resolution was to lose 20 pounds start my own YouTube channel
I want to:
Perform in a play that's in a beautiful theatre

go to university 
maintain my relationship with my lovely bf
post more sing and style posts on instagram
My goal for 2019 was to speak more comfortably in English because I am French and I have a really bad accent.

YAAAS QUEEEN!
I Would love to see Aja transform you! Or Jinkx or Bendelacreme! <3
i wanna spend more time with my girlfriend this year (long distance relationship🙄) and maaaaybeee come out to some people but i'm not quite sure whether that's a good idea...

whoever is reading this, i hope you're good and yeah have a nice day💞
We love a turtle neck queen
My goal- to be out in time to go to pride with my gf (and hopefully for her to be out too!!)

2019 goals 
~ Finish University 
~ Improve my health mentally and physically 
~ Get a boyfriend
Goals for 2019:

Eat healthier
Be more active and exercise more
Write more songs (!)
Be more productive 
Get my driver's license 
Be happier!
1st I want to reconnect with nature. In 2018 I graduated from my high school and career center!! Look who tries being an over achiever this girl. The course I was studying was wildlife and resource management which had me spending a lot of time outside. While in this class I learned being outside in the summer months is horrible for my body but when the weather is nice I LOVE being outside. With college it is really hard to get outside when you don’t have a car and can’t drive yet. But one of my goals is to try getting outside more now that I don’t have a class telling me to get out there.
2nd This year I really want to go to England in the London/ Brighton area. I have never traveled out of the country and hey I might be in debt from college but I’m young and have the rest of my life to pay that off I want to go and see the world before I have to settle down on a job. Im not positive if that goal/dream would happen but we’ll just have to find out.
3rdly i also want to learn a full song on the drums. I asked my friend to start teaching me in 2018 because I thought it could help some of my anxiety. At times it definitely has been a good help for me. I almost bought a set too but I decided I rather go to vidcon than get drums, an experience is way more fun than some object. I do have a drum set I can use at college though so I’m hoping by the end of the year I’ll know how to play a song.
Happy new year, Tyler!

My goals of 2019 are:
Get accepted to a grad school
Come out to my friends
Stay healthy
LASIK was one of the best things I ever had done. (Also, I think you'd be a great voice actor.)
My goals: 
-I want to try drag for the first time. Drag has been a big part of my life when it comes to acceptance and I want to have fun and give it a try! 
-I plan to go sky diving this year! I'm not badly afraid of heights but sky diving is just kinda scary within itself and I want to do it! 
- I also want to save up and go see Gaga in Vegas! I love Gaga and I want to treat myself to seeing my one and only queen for the first time live! Ahh SOO excited! 
-My last goal is similar to yours last year and that's developing a better relationship with food and exercise so I can feel better in my skin. 
Although I think resolutions can be overrated, I think creating actual goals is good for the new year. Okay thanks for listening bye.
My New Years resolution: 
I want to finish writing my book on Wattpad, and possibly make a new one.

Love u!
UGH I would die for a collab of you and Bob the Drag Queen.... that would make my life

Goal number 2 is to continue with my acting dream. I worked as a featured extra on some cool projects in 2018. In 2019 I hope to get my chance to show what I can do. Last goal number 3, to continue to improve my baking/cooking skills. It's my go to relaxing activity and I love creating delicious dishes. Oops actually I lied, my most important goal in 2019 is financial freedom. I want to get out of debt and move on from a difficult past. 2019 really is the year to MAKE THINGS HAPPEN!

You tell 2019 who's boss!! 🙌😄😁👍
James Charles should teach Tyler Oakley how to play piano
Okay first; wtf you are GLOWING? Like did New Year do something to you?? I’m here for it.

Honestly I’m so excited for a new book! You know I listen to Binge regularly to help me fall asleep or calm me down when I’m dealing with anxiety and so if a new audiobook comes with it then YES PLEASE! But you have to come back to Cardiff for book tour it’s rare anyone comes here. 

Honestly a concept I’ve always had for a tv show was celebrities doing non-famous jobs because I think it would be so entertaining so please do it; maybe even try some of your viewers jobs? You already know some are teachers! I’d live to see you take on a class of little kids 😂

If you get the surgery please do a video about it because I was all for it til I heard all these different things and now I’m too scared lmao 

You’ve got me so pumped for 2019! My goals are to prioritise my health because I’m dealing with a lot of issues which need to be prioritised and last year I pushed them aside to do fun things but weren’t as fun as they could be because of my health. So this year; health first, then fun. But I also wanna travel someplace new if I get better so that’s something. Oh, and blog more! 

Okay that was a book in itself 😂 happy new year, Ty! Can’t wait to see what you manage to do because you always exceed the goals you put out into the world!
I want to get more active, have successful second semester of my college freshman year and connect with more people. 🙌🏻😊
i wanna take care of my own health and fitness too!! seeing you do it along with us helps a ton!❤️❤️
Wow 23k views! You’re doing amazing!!
Get accepted into college! Travel more! Love and appreciate my family as much as I can! Learn how to cook!

'The world is a blurry place. '  - T.Oakley, 2019
My two main goals are to get into a great grad school and move out of Utah :) new adventures!!
47 views..... 166 likes.... YouTube I expect no less
It's so inspirational seeing you set high standards for yourself and seeing you meet them. This year I also wanna finish my creative projects and hopefully start more. I wanna meditate more and also I'm learning piano too so we're in it together!
Omg. I would love to see you on Trixie and Katya's show!!!
Yasss Tyler!💖💖💖💖 btw when do we get to meet your bae? 😏😏😏
My 2019 goal is to better my music capabilities, keep a long term relationship, and continue to transition into the best version of myself.
1. Get a good GPA maybe as close as 3.0/3.5 
2. Get out of the house more.. explore more!
Please make a video with Jinkx Monsoon. It would feed my soul
I have no idea where 2019 is headed. Especially since Britain is going to deal with brexit in march.
I’m just taking every day as it comes, looking after myself
My biggest hope in this year is to learn basic korean. I've learning for almost a year but I didn't do my best and I just listened to music everyday. I only studied on the holidays so I don't know much at all and I'm trying to do my best specially bc now I know a few things and so I dont get desmotivated so quickly!

Also I want t improve my grade bc this last term them went really down (here we avaluate from 0 to 20 and last year I has 18 and this term I only got 16,6 so i want to change that in time and also GO WELL ON MY FINALS BC I HAVE EXAS OF PHISICS AND BIOLOGY OMG

And then I would love to visit a little bigof the world even tho I now that I cnat afford it I'll do my best to at least be closer to do it in the future by saving as much money as I can.

I just want to send you an Happy New Year and that I jope that everything goes well in your live. This year on June it will be "our" 4 anniversary here on youtube but with Article 13 I'm not gona lie, I'm kinda of scared but lets hope that it wont be THAT bad... Well, just let me say that Portugal is a good country to visit, we are all very acceptive to foreignres :) Ly
in 2019 I would love to finally come out to my family and that's all really
A video with Eureka Ohara!!!! Yes Gawd!!!
I honestly can't wait to see what 2019 has in store for all of us
My goals for 2019:

-  Taking care of my health more, meaning physical (going to the gym and eating better) and mental (working with my depression and anxiety).
- Learn to cook and maybe start meal prepping.
- Reading more books. I recently moved to NY and take the subway everywhere so this is likely the most realistic.
- Make more gay friends especially since I never really had that many to begin with. Or just any friends, since I’m in a new place and all.
- Maybe start a YouTube channel.
- Look in to modeling since I’m trying to get out of my comfort zone.
- Be independent!!
Same as you I want to work on my book more and really do more work in general, especially at school. Plus, I want to work on my health I am the actual definition of dehydrated oops
My goal for 2019, changing my major and moving in with my boyfriend. And continue my journey with mental health and therapy.
my goals for this year are
1. become more multilingual and get more connected with my heritage.
2. start trying on makeup and find out what works for me.
3. try to not suck at dancing.
(Obsessed with the background music? Which generic YouTube track is this????)
Hey Tyler I live in Vegas & am broke as a joke but want to recommend get ink by Joey Hamilton & Walter "Sausage" Frank at Revolt Tattoos. 2 locations in Vegas. I also know that you've experienced a crowd of Pentaholics & you love music festivals. So may I recommend catching a The Mix Tape Tour concert. We are talking 5 headliners in on show. Plus I would love for to feel the experience of being surrounded by a sea of Blockheads. I love being a part of both families/fandoms. I've never seen either live but have been living through footage of NKOTB since 88. I'm 41 today it's my birthday wish for you. Gaga opened for NKOTB back in the day.
Happy new year, Tyler and you're the same age as me!!!....and we're born in '89!!!
I don’t feel as bad about posting my 2019 video today now lol I want amazingness for this year, adventure, love, and money lol
Yes queen 👑
Tyler you look so fine😍 One of the country’s you visit in 2019 should be Russia 🇷🇺♥️
I love this gay


I mean guy


Not like I was wrong

I can’t, I-
aw! i forgot how much i love tyler 🥰,
Girl you CAN NOT say you wanna be more comfortable with your shirt off when you was waaay comfortable already lol #coachella #vegas
Tyler and Thorgy Thor where Tyler is part of the Thorchestra for a show/day
"the world is a blurry place"
Happy new year Tyler ❤
Love from Germany
2019: Collab with Katya, Detox and maybe Trixie again?
I really want to get back into shape and back into dancing. I started dancing when I was 6 years old and actually minored in dance in undergrad, but ever since graduating I haven't done anything with dance and I've gotten really lazy with working out and eating healthy. So for 2019 I really want to get back into eating healthier and working out, and hopefully take a dance class or even just dance at home and make up my own choreography to songs that I love!
Oh! And I also want to work on my mental health because it has not been the best in 2018 and I really need to push myself and actually go to therapy for my anxiety and depression! I'm actually currently in grad school for mental health counseling, and I can't fully help others until I help myself!
Aww, Tyler uploaded on my birthday!!
Aww, Tyler uploaded on my birthday!!
Quite smoking. Loose 80lbs.
Hit 10k on Instagram and get my Beach Body back! 2019 is going to be perfection!
Hmmm in 2019 I want to:
•get back into writing/ reading 
•become more comfortable with & continue to figure out who I am -this includes mental health and self expression 
•start just DOING THINGS, taking chances and acting on the crazy ideas and ambitions I have 
(Also getting more sleep for school would be nice, but who are we kidding)
Good luck with your goals :D
I love Tyler and his personality! ❤️
Girl, all I’m tryna do in 2019 is keep my sanity.
I want to learn how to relax again.

I want to learn how to not focus on what others are/aren’t doing and focus on myself.

I want to not fall asleep with my TV on any longer.

I want to stretch more.

I want to accomplish doing 150 squats a day, and keep growing from there. (You said 6 months so that’s the goal 😂) 

I want to stay COMMITTED to my goals.
My goals for 2019 are 
1.to be healthier note just physically but mentally as well 
2. To finish writing a book I’m working on and publish it (hopefully I can afford an editor)
3. Stop being held hostage by my anxiety and get out and enjoy life
I want to really get my life together. I want to organize my house and become an overall cleaner tidier person. I also have a fitness goal and your fitness progress has been motivating to me! I want abs!!
My goals for 2019 involve prioritizing my mental health and my self love! I want to not overwork myself, to journal more, to start regular therapy sessions at my school, and to focus on doing things that make ME happy instead of what makes others happy. I may not know what those things are yet, but I want to take those little baby steps to ensure that I am living a life that I want to live ☺️

I also want to go on more spontaneous adventures with my friends, whether it’s going to a new restaurant or going on a road trip 😌
You should collab with Naomi Smalls!
In 2019 I want to watch Tyler Oakley all day long everyday of the year lyyyyy💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This year I am 
1. trying to wake up everyday at 730 so I dont waste the day away. I want to live the year one meaningful day at a time.
2. Trying to procrastinate less bc my life depends on it, and I'm tired of wasting my life away by procrastinating.
3. I want to self love and self care for myself more. 

Love your videos tyler!!

One of my goals for 2019 is to read 52 books!
Become one of Tyler Oakley' friends
I want to...
1. Be more active
2. Be on my phone less
3. Read more
4. Write more
5. Pass all of my classes with an 80% or higher
For 2019: 

1.Be more body and self positive
2. Embrace and accept myself and my sexuality
3. Hit the gym 5 times a week minimum
4. Look for the good in the world and stop following the negative mainstream storylines
My goals for 2019: 
-Get back into iRacing. (I already fired it back up, after getting a Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback wheel for Christmas, but my computer no longer meets the minimum requirements. Hopefully I can find a good computer and get back into it. They have rallycross, and I've always wanted to drive a proper rallycross circuit.)
Finally learn guitar. (I took a guitar class in 8th grade [a decade ago], but I was switched out after a week because the counselors made a mistake when putting my schedule together that year.)
-Go to at least one concert. (I'm torn between Queensrÿche in early April, after their new album drops, Queen in mid-June, or Megadeth and Ozzy Osborne in the same venue the next day. [I've only been to one concert, and that was Rush on their Time Machine tour in 2010. It's about time I go to another concert.])
my goals for 2019: work on my social skills, try new things, try to focus more on my needs than others
You also look very handsome in this video😍😍
Come to South Africa!! Cape Town is beautiful!
Switch jones with me! I work at Trader Joe’s in New Jersey bishhhh

Tyler Oakley for Lion King 2019
Your yearly goals videos are always my favorite, along with the reflections!
My main goal for 2019 is to finally become monitized on YouTube. Yes I know I still have a bit of a ways to go buuuut its all about positive vibes for this year. Also to get in the habit of working out more and cooking more meals
I just want to BE LESS HARD ON MYSELF
We want to help others but sadly no money to due so. Our merch isn't selling or our gofundme is working but we will not give up. My main goal for 2019 helping others!
I haven't really made a list of solid goals for 2019 so you're giving me a perfect opportunity to actually think about it 😂
1. I want to read 55 books this year
2. I want to go out and enjoy people's company more whether that be going to the movies more or just genuinely hanging out rather than staying cooped up & letting loneliness sink in
3. I want to write a draft for a book (no matter how shaky it turns out) before the end of the year.
Let's make it happen 😈
This year I want to focus on helping other people who are struggling with who they are and make a difference to the world. I aspire to become like you, Dan and Phil who have helped so many people just by being yourselves. I also want to help fight of Lgbtq rights because I believe everyone is important, no matter what they're differences. Hopefully 2019 works out for you too! 💗
How about making a drag related video with courtney act ? 😍😍
He's still with me.... lucky... him! 😂😂
My main goal for 2019 is to appreciate what I have and be more grateful, try to be healthier and comfortable in my body and find a job or studies I actually love.  Oh and also do more art!
You should have Naomi Smalls transform you, she is one of my favorites because of her fashion and style
Awko taco 🌮 moment I just voted on the thumbnail on twitter and I go on YouTube and you already posted it but you know what you did the one I chose so yeah gonna go eat some tacos bye
Trying different jobs would be a great series!   It's exactly the sort of thing that your channel needs!

To meet my frens from other cities and to say to my crush girl I love her
This year I'm taking charge of my mental health! I've already started seeing a therapist and I'm working on being more open about how I'm feeling and doing. I've also decided that when I make the decision this summer when my lease is up about whether I'm staying another year in New York City or moving home to North Carolina, I'm going to make it based on what's best for me and my emotional and mental well-being and not what I feel like I should be doing or what everyone else is doing. 

Excited to see what you do this year, Tyler! x
My goal for this year is getting good grades and pass my classes (I am a freshman in high school btw)
You would be the best flight attendant :)

Another goal is to not be so stressed out all the time with school and the daily demands of life, because all that stress is unhealthy is taking away life’s precious and most beautiful moments.
I've been liking your recent videos more and more..

I just watch you on Rupaul's and you were so cute!! Don't lose weight too fast. I do that all the time, and it made me look so old. You need to be patient and give your skin time to adjust to weight lose. Lose weight VEEERY SLOOOOWLY. YOu only 29 years old. AND I'M 43 for God sakes！You obviously have more time than me, so take it!
My main goal for 2019 is to take care of myself and focus on my self care. It's my year to start loving myself, getting rid of negativity, and becoming the person I want to be. Thanks for reading :)
2019 goals

Also, I hope to meet you this year 6years is too long x
Im doing this just to motivate myself haha (and to get answer from you) 
So my goal this year is to be fit, I wanna go to the gym on a daily basis and work on my body because Im too weak and uncapable of defending myself.
Have a good year! 
Ghita, from Morocco🇲🇦
I have 20/400 vision and without my glasses I can't even tell that there's words on things that are further than one foot away-
ALSO YOU NEED TO DO MORE VIDEOS WITH DRAG QUEENS
My goal is to start my YouTube channel again 🤗 I am starting to plan and be more organized this time around
Love all these. Could totally see you doing voice overs. I could also see you on Broadway. Defiantly write another book please!!!!! Love all your videos with your friends. Can't wait to see what 2019 sends your way for our entertainment.Love you Tyler
My goals for this year:
1.Better my Mental Health and the way I see myself. I’m gonna learn to embrace my true self more and not hold back
2.Graduate High School w/ a 3.9 GPA and get myself prepared for College wherever I decide to go in these next few months. It’s stressful knowing that I’ll be choosing my future for the next 4 years within this next month, but I’m gonna KICK ASS 💪🏼 
3.Start writing more songs and playing my ukulele more. After Best Camp Ever in 2017, y’all inspired me to keep writing, singing and uploading to my YouTube. I have to keep that motivation and grind going because it’s something that I really love but I’ve been so distracted and stressed. NOT NO MORE! I’m about to write BOPS! 

That’s all, but I’m ready for 2019 :)
Monet X Change would never approve of this turtleneck Tyler come on

actually bonus

-i wanna maybe go on a date at some point
I’ll go to Vegas with you! 😍😍
my goals are to meet a lot of my ideals, get better a drawing, and go to my first pride parade in June
I will go to Vegas anytime, love that town and I don't even gamble.
YES PLEASE TRY NEW JOBS I AM HERE FOR THAT
Thank you for evrything im blined but i  can here you and you inspire me
I would love to stand up for myself more and conquer my anxiety!! Oh! And I want to learn how to snowboard!!
I would love to move out, get a boyfriend, and perhaps start playing with makeup and drag.
I feel like Tyler got more wrinkly lmao
I hope this year will be happy and successful for you, Tyler 😘
So this past year I failed a college class (because procrastination...). So THIS year, I really want to make the dean’s list and raise my GPA. Check back with me in June, henny. I’ll be thriving (I hope). ✨
1. stop touching my face so darn much
2. learn to read tarot cards
3. do some situps
Tyler come visit Asia!!! Would love to meet you in person :)
I have my first solo art show this spring and my only big goal this year is to make that amazing. Other than that I've decided I'm going to start practice driving (about damn time at nearly 25).
omg i just posted a video last week about my resolutions and things and i was just thinking about how i hope i can look back and see if i accomplished them. congratulations on accomplishing your old resolutions and best of luck accomplishing your new ones!
Okay I literally told myself I would not make any resolutions for this year because I felt like I wouldn’t follow through but you’ve inspired me to at least try:
1. Read more - I LOVE reading but lately it’s felt like I can’t sit and do it anymore. My mind is just a million places and in a book isn’t one of them.
2. Commit to writing  - Sorry sis, I copied your goal. 😂 I’ve always had a passion for writing but I’ve never been able to commit to writing longer pieces. I do poetry which is only a few stanzas long but whenever I try to write a short story, half of the time i don’t finish. This year I want to finish multiple short stories and come up with an idea for a book since writing a book is also on my bucket list.
3. Keep being kind - I’ve always prided myself in spreading kindness. This goal is simply to continue that, no matter how rude anyone can be in return.
4. Keep progressing in the Community: I’m in multiple clubs (one of which, i am president for) but I want to keep extending my reach to more community work. Give Kids the World is my favorite thing at the moment ❤️
5. Learn more French: Je parle un petite peu de Français mais je veux un savoir plus. (I speak a little bit of French but I want to learn more).
My goals this year:
1. Draw every day this year (pretty simple)
2. Work out more because my chronic illness is getting worse, and I need to do all that I can to live a happy life. 
3. I need to learn to love myself and stop putting other people before me and help myself for once.
4. Go to Pride festival this year since I was in the hospital last year. 
5. Be more social and try and make new friends!!
Happy new year Tyler!!😊🤗I’m gonna learn to play piano, hopefully start a cake company, write more, specifically song lyrics, and try more foods and cook more meals☺️
-get in shape 
-
1. come to sweden
2. VEGAS BABY (love that the podcast is back)
3. Do a video with KATYA or BIANCA
My goals for 2019
- Get a job (hopefully this can be done in a month or so)
- Learn Calligraphy, my handwriting can be horrible so this is a challenge
- Improve my strength and flexibility, through dancing and aerial silks
And hopefully I can meet you again Tyler. I've met you in 2015, 2016 & 2017 but we missed last year! Anyway, here's to 2019!!❤️
I want to walk the Camino de santiago in Spain this year. I also want to find a job that I enjoy.
2019 bucket list:
- stick to one aesthetics
- convince one of my friends to try being a furry for a day
- get a job (any job I really need something to do with my life and getting money for it is also a great perk
- stop buying random shit that I never use
- (by far the worst one/ the one I will never do) exercise🙄
this was such a chill vid and you seem happy which makes me happy:) and now im eager to get stuff done this year ! (im with you re writing..) I'd love if you did a job series that would be so fun. Thank you for all the videos Ty, i love having you part of my life<3<3
travel the world and come to sweden!!! <3
dear tyler from the future; dear myself from the future!

it’s currently january and i finished high school last december. very proud of myself for graduating but now im lost as hell and i have no idea of what i want to do with my life.
i always hoped my true passion would come to me at some point before february 2019. we are close and i have to make decisions by them but i am still clueless.
i have to hope that everything will be okay, but i am a mess right now and my parents want to know what i’ll do. i signed up for medical school but im not sure i want to do that and i dont want to waste my parents’s money and time. i dont want to waste my OWN time. but i am running out of time and idk if i should stay here at my small town, if i should move to buenos aires a bigger city, if i should get a job or go to university. i have never been more clueless in my whole life. so lost. im beginning to miss high school and high school SUCKED!

so my goal is to figure it out. i hope that if i read this by the end of the year i can look back and be like “it’s okay i figured it out i was so worried and crying all day for no reason!”. my goal is to know what i want .... but it’s hard.

also lose weight and be happy


love u tyler :’) <3
He looks a bit jaundiced
My goal is to, Jump 3 foot in Horseriding! I also want take care of my body more! I want to also want to start on Testosterone! Have a amazing New year and I hope everyone works very hard!
My goals in 2019 

My goal in 2019 is to take better care of myself and start putting my physical and mental health first for once. I tend to let myself fall into everyone else's life and helping them and fixing their problems I don't leave enough to help myself and I find myself slowly rotting away. I want to take better care of myself

My goal in 2019 is to cut out the people in my life who cause me stress and anxiety and who no matter how many times I've proven to be a good friend will always choose me as their last option. My goal is to find friends who actually value me and want me in their lives

My goal in 2019 is to graduate and go to a technical college and get started on my Automotive training. Get a job in the field I want and support myself and hopefully have enough to help my family. My goal is to be financially at peace.

💗💗💗💗

i want to fix my Smile That my Biggest goal of my life right now.
Tyler......all writers don't actually want to do the writing. You're in good company
okay my 2019:
- i. am. going. to. be. on. time. to. school. every. day.
- ya girl is graduating?? so i guess figuring out college and what i actually want to do and hopefully not be a terrible adult?
How do you feel about A Star is Born only receiving original song award?  I am happy for Gaga but feel they were robbed.  Of course, I need to see quite a few of those films.  I don't think Bohemian Rhapsody was even close as good as A Star is Born.  I have to say the actor did an outstanding job.
Yey😂❤️😂😂💫💫
In 2019: 
I'm going to get a tattoo.
Yes Pokemon master!!!!! 😍😍😍
I admire you for all the things you do. I can't even get out of my bed... But this year I would really love to get myself a tattoo, there would be a problem with my parents, but I really want this to happen. And my second resolution is that I want to focus more on learning languages, English is not my first language and I would really like to have at least level C1+ on the end of this year. There are more, but these are the main ones. So wish me all the best, I also wish you all the best to fulfill your dreams!
1. I want to get a job in my field of studies
2. I want to keep running in the mornings every day
3. I want to be a good sister/granddaughter
You’re the perfect age for lasic!!!!! Get it.  I still have a while to do do it. My aunt did it recently and it’s such a game changer.
Well... About the job thing: I'm a sound engineer (with bands/artists and stuff like that). So if you're ever in the Netherlands... Hit me up and who knows. I think I might be able to let you give it a shot ;)
My goals for 2019 is to succeed in my studies to get a boyfriend (I hope 😂) to meet new friends cause I'm going to a new school this year (wish me luck) to love myself more (cause I have insecurities).
My goals for the year: Kick the butt of my bronchitis and do more yoga.
Early squad 👍🏻
Happy new year like a week late but idc
Expand my business (Airbnb), get my driving license, learn German and be happy!
my goals for 2019: 
-be in a healthy romantic relationship
-apply to college and scholarships
-finish two of my novels (fully complete for novel 1, at least second draft for novel 2)

-present more closely to what my gender is (i'm trans)
My goal for 2019 is to get through my first year of Uni with minimal meltdowns.
Is Tyler A Top Or A Bottom?
Always love your vids!!!
TO GRADUATE ON MAY 2019 AND BE A CPA ON OCTOBER 2019!!!!!!!!! I'LL ACHIEVE IT!! CHEER FOR MEEEEEE!
my goals for 2019 are: 

- get into the universities i want and to have a choice rather than having to go to one because i had no other option
-just overall good marks because its been a rough first half of the year and if i can pull them up i'd be proud of myself
- go to montreal to visit emily at least once in 2019
- be more active; work out, play sports, all that jazz 
- make a bigger effort to eat healthier
- to buy either a new camera or lens to take to university
- to read at least 20 books because i've fallen out of it and i miss reading
-to see you in person sometime (help me out dude, come to toronto)
- get my full driver's license
- learn a new language
-get a tattoo??

in hindsight this was a lot more than i expected to write but at least theres more of a chance that i'd accomplish any of the above
I want to be more positive and be more organized
in 2019, i want to go out more since i stay at home a lot. i want to dress and feel more confidently since that’s something i don’t have. also i want to write more and expand my horizons :)
My goals are to get more financially responsible and finally get the opportunity to get out of the living situation that my Mom and I are in.
You could ask Dan Howell for piano lessons or advice on how to get started? Though he says he's really bad if you see any of his videos he's  actually really good when he plays.
I wanna get married and buy a house in 2019! Yay to eating ramen for the next couple of years :D
First 





Jk I know I’m not
Happy new year ♥️ how you’ll have a very productive year
That swear is giving Steve Jobs realness. iJustine is shaking
Self-worth before net worth!
Luv u. Are you too tired to get into too much detail because I work in customer service and worked in the past 20 days straight without a break and I am happy for the work but I am effing exhausted. Again love you always have so I’ll just save us having come out of a horrific five-year nightmare relationship about a year ago I let so many things that used to be the most important things to me fall by the wayside most importantly I’ve been a marathon runner since I was in college and I let that temporarily get destroyed because of a horrible relationship I don’t rack your Leslie completed one marathon during that nightmare stretch of five years. But my last marathon was in NYC 2014. He sabotaged two other very important races that I had tried to train for him but was unable to because he is a drug attic to and ruin my life. 2017 and 2018 or spent frantically trying to and succeeding and getting away and out of that and slowly trying to rebuild any semblance of a life that was worth living for. I was overly ambitious last year and had entered two races but the mess were still so much of a mess that I couldn’t do it so I pushed the races off for this year. I will be honest my resolutions haven’t stuck even though we’re only one weekend I feel like a complete and total failure already. But I hope to turn it around as fast as possible and claw my way back to being the person I used to be when I was independent and healthy and training and racing and had any reason to hope for anything. I hope you’re taking all of your goals for the year I hope I obtain any one of mine
You should visit Slovenia!
Do a video with Willam, Katya, or Courtney Act!
Do a video with Willam, Katya, or Courtney Act!
One goal I have is to be more organized. Also, I need to step up my fitness and healthy eating game.
Omg Tyler!!! I have so many goals this year and some I already have plans for. So 1. Become healthier I started doing spin classes and they are amazing. 2. I have the biggest dream of doing a mission trip and seeing real life elephants so in March I’m going to Tanzania on a mission trip and after I am done I am staying a little longer to explore and go on a safari!!!! I’m so excited that not only I am going to help out others I get to see my soul animal the elephant lol p.s if you want to go let me know we can go on a safari together!!!! 3. To give back to my community more. Normally on Valentine’s Day I make little valentine bags with stuffed animals and chocolate and hand them out to random people I think looks lonely etc. so hopefully I can do more of that. I would also like to go back to Vegas because it’s hella fun and we all deserve a break And my final goal is to manage my money better lol.  Love you Tyler!!! ❤️😘💙🥰💜 cheers to a new year Queen 😘
What I hope to accomplish in 2019:
1: Get a gf.
2: Save up enough to fly to LA.
3: Get better at drawing
4: To finally learn to drive meaning getting my learners.
5: Get more into SFX style of makeup which is more bts movie, stage and Hallowewen type looks.
The one thing i wanna do for my 2019 is to write more. I have so many readers on Wattpad that I honestly want to write more and get better at my writing. Maybe even start a book that could one day be published... who knows all i know is that i want to write more this year!
Okay but serious question, Tyler: would you ever get a tattoo with your fans or even just a fan? (If you need an artist recommendation by the way, I'm your human. My life revolves around tattoos😅👌🏻)
Girl, I love that turtleneck! 👌 Three things I wanna do this year is loose weight, get a job (so far I'm just a substitute) and travel!
I love you so much! ❤️
WAIT you're turning thirty???? God you look 25
If you come to germany this year and maybe even visit the city I live in I'll literally be your personal tour guide
GOAL! Get to know where my energy levels burn out so I don't over work myself! What's the point in doing loads now if it stops you working in the future?? 2019: the year I respect R&R for the productive act is actually is. Hope you have an awesome year!
I wanna start being more open and make some good friends. And maybe start a YouTube channel
Oh man. I too want to focus on treating my body right. I also want to have some career advancements, get one step closer to being a full time actor. I also want to read more!
I need to write my first book this year, at least start writing it. I would love to have it published by 2020. Why? Because it is NEWZ! 😆❤️

YOU SHOULD VISIT IRAN
I don't know he is gay or not?
Adored this video & oh my goodness there are SO many things I want to accomplish in 2019. 

First off I want to figure out what the heck I wanna do with my life, or at least have a small idea. All of my friends are applying to University & I still have NO idea what I want to do so I’m procrastinating & shit which isn’t getting me anywhere. So what I want to do is apply for a program at a community college while I try to figure myself out. So that’s a big #1. 
#2 I wanna travel! I literally haven’t been out of my country, EVER! I want to visit the world & go on adventures & have new experiences! 
#3 I want to create a short film! I love art & don’t want to limit myself to a pencil & paper. There are so many different forms of art & cinematography is something I’d really like to explore. 

Hopefully I can get on it & make 2019 my bitch. 😂 sending love from @perfectlyatease on twitter. x
My goals for 2019 are 1a. Become more confident and comfortable in my bisexuality 1b. Not talk about my relationships to those that don’t accept that I’m bi. 2. Be more purposeful within my day with what I wanna do. 3. Not listen to what any one else or what my anxiety says to think or do
Hey Tyler, I have a 5yo and a 3yo, and I'm a homeschool mom. I'd love you to do my job for the day so that I could go and write (you accomplish one of YOUR goals, and I accomplish one of mine!). They aren't little enough that you can break them, so there's less pressure than them being babies. HMU if you're interested! :) :) :)
Ilyyyy💛💛💛
My news years resolution was to eat less sugary food but my birthday is the 1st so I already lost it
Tyler! If you don't want to commit to the surgery of LASIK there are contact lenses that you can wear over night, take out in the morning and you wont need to wear any kind of correction. (they reshape your cornea as you sleep). They are called Ortho-K (Orthokeratolog) ask your eye doctor if you're a good canidate!
I just want to get through college for the next 6 or 7 years
Try to work as daycare center
i’m so proud i already came out to my mom this year!
my goals:
-keep my zebra succulent plant alive, she's called Zeborah (this is the first time I've had a houseplant only god can save her)
-do something productive/requiring focus each day (this can literally include movies, normally my attention span is so bad i can't watch them so they count which makes it seem weird but i'm working on improving focus so WHATEVER WORKS. i'm keeping a list)
-make it through my first year of uni alive (this includes not dying while in class, that would be embarrassing)
-hhh find some of that affordable therapy pls the mental kind and physiotherapy kind my shoulder is KILLING me so is my brain
-do not. die. it is forbidden.

yeah that's about it, i don't normally set goals but the second one is a big thing for me this year, gotta get that focus considering i'm starting uni and all.
My life would be made if I met Lady Gaga lol
This year I really want to travel overseas :)
My goals for 2019 are: to set up my art space so I can record myself painting and post the videos to my YouTube channel. Right now most of the videos I have up are concert footage I filmed of Pentatonix and Todrick Hall. I'd like to have at least 50 paintings done by the end of the year that I like enough to sell. I'd like to interview more people. And lastly, I want to continue saving money so I can buy the Ram Promaster cargo van I want.
You look like Anthony Rapp in Rent
Introduce us to Anthony!!!
My goals are to eat better and be more nice. Dats mostly it
Happy 2019 🥳🔥
I turn 30 this year too and feel like I haven’t accomplished very much in my life yet... this year I’m hoping I can go back to school, finally find some kind of fitness related activity that I love, and continue making positive progress with my mental health.
Happy new year!!
Ok but why do you sound like my therapist
lmao his youtube channel's dead.
if ur gonna travel to 10 countries this year i would sure love some travel vlogs! could be fun :-)
Happy new year Tyler!! 💗💗
One of my most important goals for 2019 is to have collected enough money from my job to move out, and then adopt a male Pembroke Welsh Corgi to love and raise after that! The second goal is to see how many times you'll notice my posts! The third goal is as equally important at the others are. I want to meet you! The fourth is to stay as healthy as possible. The fifth goal is to reduce my own fears/anxieties and be supported by you while I'm doing that. The sixth is to possibly become rich. There are more goals I could share, but this is a good start!
Hi Tyler Oakley my name is Everyone.
Only you would put Pokemon Go on the list hahaha
So 2019 is going to be a big year for me because I will be graduating from university (hopefully). I'm really hoping to do well in all my exams and assignments without stressing too much at the same time. I really want to still enjoy my last semester. Also hopefully will find where I want to go with my career and find something which I find has a purpose and makes me happy, hopefully, something like social marketing or politics related, as my degree is in contemporary culture and society. But mainly, be happy! Wouldnt mind if I found a nice boyfriend either hahaha. Hope 2019 is fantastic for you Tyler and you achieve even more of your hopes and dreams x
my goal is to travel more and to go to more concerts! and also try to say yes more 💓💓
We Stan A Sassy Queen
Gosh you’re videos are always so great and entertaining.
My goals for 2019 are getting good grades at school because I want to be a smart student or at least a smart student, eat healthy because I sometimes just eat chips, last is try to hang out with my friend because well I've never got a time to hang out with my friend
My goals for this year:

Get a gf
Learn more sign language
Be more productive in school
Be less awkward
Be more kind
Read at least 2 books per month
Eat less sugar
Walk a lot
Actually go to school every week
well my 2019 resolution is to become a vegetarian and i’m still holding on pretty well lets see how this goes
I just love you!
HAPPY NEW YEAR QUEEN 💕
This year I really want to get in control of my health and well being. I have been so stressed out for the past few years and I finally feel that I have the will to become healthier and push forward. Another thing I want to do is learn to forgive myself. Whenever someone gets upset at me, I feel terrible. I always think what a failure I am as a daughter, a friend, and as a sister. This year is the year I take the time to build myself up and tell myself that I will make mistakes but that I’m not worthless because of them
Is his boyfriend a secret?
Love you tyler!
Collab with Shane again!!!
My goal is to get into one of my top colleges!

happy new year :3
You go sis ❤️
As you should
My goal for 2019 is to get a steady job, get my drivers license, and eventually go to college. To be more positive and not just do things the easy way to get them done. I wanna learn the way of the world and show people that things are good and to always look at the brighter side of things.
and get a better singing voice hahah
Early💜

My goal is to upload to YouTube (like actually instead of just saying so) more this year. I also wanna get a job and find my own place to live.
Self Care - because I REALLY suck at it and my job is ridiculously stressful and triggering so I have no choice but to make it a priority
I want to pass my exams 😂
am I the only one that loves the way he talks
In six months, I will be reunited with my boyfriend in France. We just had to leave each other for the second time... it’s so hard, especially in college, but I’m taking it day by day. My goal is to making it until I see him again!! ❤️ it might sound stupid, but he is one of my biggest sources of happiness and my best friend. Everyday is a struggle.
what happened to this channel
KIMCHI!!!

Good luck
Bless.
hiiii love you!!
My goal for this year is to make goals
Hi Tyler! One of my goals for 2019 is to become more assertive. I have a hard time telling people no and find that I am way too much of a people pleaser, so I would love to work on that this year. Another goal that I have is to avoid eating fast food as much as possible. Eating out has become a weekly thing for me, so I'd like to reduce it to once or twice a month. My last goal is to try my best not to worry about things too much. I worry about things on pretty much a daily basis, so I'd like to work on reducing my stress as much as possible and telling myself that worrying won't make things any better. I hope you accomplish all of your goals and have a wonderful 2019(:
been watching since 2015 & it’s genuinely so exciting to see you grow as a human! i’m HERE for the trying out new jobs series that would be so fun! i’d also love it if you made a sit down video going through your goals from last year and how exactly you accomplished those of them you did! my goals for the new year are to start getting my shit together for college apps & get back into sports & learn the drums & keep a journal! love you & your content tyler <3
do lasic in 2019
1,000th.
WILLAM!!
why does he look like ellen
Yaaassss finally Tilly
I wanna be like u Tyler
Collab with Willam!!
Happy New Year❤
i just want to be happier
if you wanna come to a country come to scotland and say hi to your glaswegians
When will we meet your boyfriend
YOU SLAY
My goals for 2019:

-Start up a YouTube channel, & freelance writing business
-Commit to writing
-Learn how to play mandolin, ukelele, and electric guitar 
-Buy more awesome clothes (turtlenecks, bomber jackets, etc)
-Try a new style of martial arts
-leave my current job for the sake of my mental health
-Save more money and feel more financially comfy.
-Get more involved in physical fitness & meditation
-Meet more people and form some lasting friendships. 
-Become more experimental with makeup.
-Get more than 2 tattoos
Lol maybe if I write them down somewhere, they'll actually happen. But anyway, I want to help my friends gain confidence at the same time I do. I want to get better in all facets of my musical career. Start taking better care of myself. Start saving money better than I do now lol. And finally, I want to do better in my classes
This year, I really want to get into a habit of focusing on the good in life instead of the bad. 2018 was a really negative year, and I really want to be able to move on from that. I’m also hoping to do a lot more baking, as it’s something I love but don’t really have time for. I started therapy shortly after the New Year, and I’m looking forward to continuing to take steps to help myself, and get better. As unlikely as it is, I’m also holding out hope for a relationship this year. I’d also like to start standing up for causes I believe in, and being an advocate when I can. I’ve been thinking about starting a GSA at my school since we don’t have one. I hope 2019 turns out to be a billion times better than 2018, and I hope you all have a great year too!
Try to go back to college this year and travel around the world 🌎 if I can go??
i would love to travel more and see new and old places
Alyssa and Fame please and ty

Tyler Irrelevant
Start my career in entertainment!!!
Damn, I've never thought I'd see Tyler with wrinkles, hitting 30 y.o. mark soon. I feel old lol.
This year I am going to try to try to do things to make me happier. This means letting go of toxic people/people I don't wanna roll with anymore, only doing things because I want too and not because I feel like I have to to please someone else, taking more time for me, and not depriving myself of the things I need/want in life. Basically if I think it will make me happy Imma do it
Love you tyler

This year I found out I was bisexual..So Hey Tyler I'm Coming Out To You First! I also went to a Fall Out Boy concert. That's about it. My birthday is this Thursday. Btw ily

So much did happened in 2018! Thanks to you Tyler I came out to my family as Bisexual. You made me feel comfortable enough to come out to my judgmental family knowing they wouldn’t be happy about it, but you convinced me that it was ok to be who I am. So thank you thank you thank you for everything you do! I am extremely grateful for all you do! I can’t wait to see what you will do in 2019!

Happy New Year Tyler!!!! I love you so so much and you have helped me more than you know in the past few years. I hope 2019 is the best year for you because you definitely deserve it and if not more!!! 🖤🖤🖤
What a year you've had! I'm so proud of all you've accomplished! Chosen family was my favourite series you've done this year, it means so much to me. Happy new year my queen! ♥️
I'm gonna be honest, I was only here for Chosen Family and October to December, but I love how much you do in a year, Tyler. It's great to see you advocate for causes you love along with finding happiness in what you do.
2018 was such a hard year, but Tyler Oakley helped make it better for so many people! Thank you and I'm so happy you had a great year! Wish you well for 2019!
Tyler inspirede to come out to my friends, thank you tyler

Edit: thank you tyler, I hope you have an even more amazing 2019 and your relationship last more than a lifetime
live from ig
Tyler, great vlog! Next year you can combine.accomplishments, like devour a hissing cockroach with Kory Kuhl, while both in drag trying to prove that you're smarter then a 5th grader!!!
when you haven't watched tyler in years because you have been stressed out and then finally came back. I'm back tyler and i'm here to stay!!
My favorite part of 2018 on your channel was defiantly when you went back to your old high school and did a bunch of cool stuff there, especially meeting up with your old teachers. I love watching you through you years. I never want you to stop. I love you Tyler!
I ALMOST THOUGHT THIS SAID "100 things that DIED"...... oopsie i guess i'm not wide awake yet 🙄🌹
you are so inspo, tyler. thank you so much❤️
My favorite types of videos you do are most definitely the Chosen Family series. Makes me laugh, makes me cry, but most importantly makes me hope in all mankind. I am straight, but I love my gays, lesbos, bis, trans, all inclusive... In short I love peace between all people. 💕
No, THANK YOU, Tyler for everything you’ve done to make OUR 2018 great! You’ve done so much for the LGBTQ+ Community and we all love you for it! ❤️
I absolutely love these videos Tyler 🤩💕
Wow I haven’t been keeping up! Thats a lot that I’m gonna go watch now; I stopped watching YouTube during the summer
Thank you for making my New Years this year even possible. I am sat on a foreign friends couch, who I met because we both liked you. We first met at the 2015 Slumber party tour London, along with 3 other internet friends of ours. Now i‘m spending New Years with her, watch Guardians of the Galaxy rn. 😄😘
Great end of year post, Tyler.  If I may ... I watch everything, but treasure your vids of substance.  I get the need for the wacko things ... no disrespect intended ... but you are so natural as a host, interviewer, observer that your work that has a message to it is always excellent, and often superb.  Those are always  worth the price of admission ... which, come to think of it, is always free. :)  Happiest of new years to you and all!
You have achieved so much in an year Tyler! Wow... Cant wait for what next? Specially in spring of 2019!!
Good LORD. Tyler gets more done in one year than I get done in one DAY! 😨
You did amazing sweetie!! I am so proud!! I love you soooooooooooo much !!!!!
'filmed something SUPER secret' as if we don't know its the amazing race 2.0
"Oh my god what an icon" -Me for the duration of this video
To see your early days on YouTube to seeing you use your platform for positive social change is so wonderful. Keep doing you Tyler.
Another amazing year from Tyler. I wish you the best, and everything more for 2019. Ilysm!
This was so cute!
somehow I forgot the Olympics were in 2018... what a blur
Can't wait to see what adventures u get up to in 2019!😀👍
YOU WERE A QUEEN SLAYING THE GAME, TYLER. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID THIS YEAR ♥️
I loved all of these but I all ways love chosen family bc I am LGBTQ+ and also 13 in 12 days, so that all makes my happy to see people like me, thank you so much.
this made me cry, ily tyler



Edit: thank you tyler, you made my awful day so much better
The CHOSEN FAMILY series was so well done I LOVE the balance of serious and fun content
Tyler your videos always make my day! You inspired me and helped me came out to my mom this year! Scary but it was worth it. Happy new year!
I’m hoping 2019 is the year I will get to meet Tyler cause I’ve been waiting 5 years 🙃

2018 seems to have been my absolutely mind-blowing year thanks to Tyler. Each episode cheered me up. I admire you Tyler! Thank you for your endless energy and your kindness. The way you treat people inspires and makes my faith in the good stronger. I wish you all the best in 2019 and send you the warmest greetings from Russia! (We have already met the New Year here!)

Not hating, just informing !
And this is what we like to call IMPACT

It's 2019 now which means 7 years of watching your amazing content! Thanks for inspiring me 💙
this is the first thing i watched in 2019 and may i day i am SO glad i chose this. insanely proud of you and how far you’ve come, tyler. i love you so dang much. this year is OUR year, i can feel it!
i love that he does this every year and its my favorite thing to watch.
2018 was a big year for Tyler.  I remember one of my 2018 highlights was watching the Pyeong Chang slopes on television with my parents and seeing him hugging an athlete on the screen.  I gasped and said Hello (As if he could hear me over 2000 miles away.)  2019 is turning out to be my year as I get my professional and personal lives in order as I joined match.com this year and am getting on top of career prospects by collaborating with my advisors for my final year of grad school.  I need to take an internship as part of my capstone and I want to have a job lined up for 2020 after I graduate.
I LOVE YOU WHAT A YEAR IT HAS BEEN BISH AND FOR MORE 2019🖤🖤🧡💘💓💜❣️💞💙💙💟💗❤️

In 2018 I graduated high school, visited family across the country, went to Disneyland and universal studios, visited California for the first time, came out to 3 friends as bisexual, watched love Simon 7 times, got the last book I needed in a long book series, Met David tennant and mark sheppard at my local comic con, got to see fall out boy, state champs, panic at the disco, and Hayley kiyoko live
One of the best videos to end the yesr

Tyler Oakley should have his own private room at MSU. Like Oprah has here famous spots.  Did you know your staying at Tyler Oakley room his bed is right there LOL. That will get him more fandom  and so we don't get question "who's Tyler Oakley".... Just make it known Lol
Happy new year Tyler 🎉🎉
Since when did he get a man!?!?!?!?! I knew nothing about that!!!
HAPPY New year Tilly
Honestly, I am so proud of you and everything you’ve done for the LGBT community. Even though I don’t watch u as much as I did in 2015, you’re still my idol, well, my gaydol (lol sorry i tried). I’m excited to see what you do in 2019 and I hope this year will bring you tons of joy and happiness like you’ve brought for me and many others.
ILY Tyler❤

❤❤☺☺🌈🌈
I’m early! Omg!!!!! 41st person here!
Hey
this video just told me i’m lazy
What is the point of disliking this?!? I don’t get it
I haven’t watched you since 2014/2015 and honestly have been following you but not watching anything. But I watched all the 100 things you did that you linked to your Instagram story. I feel like I missed so much I want to see. Now I’m going to go back and watch a bunch of videos!
Wholesome.
Happy newyear
2:28 WHAT IS IT TY?¿
Ellen
"bragging for 5 minutes straight"
I Still don't think being gay is right. But if it make people happy I will support them
Hey! I'm Alex with the cat from the video. =) Fingolfin is doing much better while on pain medication every day and getting steroids every 1-2 weeks. I know it won't last forever, but it means so much to me to have family and friends (Tyler, included!) who care so much. I just said the other day that sometimes everything seems really dark, like you can't see the end of the tunnel, but sometimes someone comes along with a flashlight to make the rest of the journey lighter for you. <3 So happy for the others who Tyler was able to help in some way. Happy Holidays!
Tyler has officially became the Ellen of YouTube.
TYLER I LOVE U SO MUCH THANK U FOR GETTING ME A VIDEO MESSAGE FROM DAN AND PHIL HAVE THE BEST HOLIDAYS I APPRECIATE U SO SO MUCH <3
That Dan and Phil present was a dream! What a sweet thing for them to reach out like that! And Tyler you're so amazing for doing all this, thank you for making these people happy and MERRY CHRISTMAS! 😊😘
The kids at the end were more exited for the pizza party than $500 😂



Edit: Ahh thanks for all the likes!! Tyler hearted my comment 💕 This is my biggest achievement
I'm full on crying right now about that cat. Hoping he's getting all the love and snuggles he deserves (which I'm sure he is). <3 It's so hard losing a pet, and the costs associated with it can be wild. So sweet of you Tyler to help out (with everybody, but I've just got a soft spot for kitties).
5:26 no you’re crying
Aww Tyler you’re so sweet ❤️ Have a Merry Christmas 🎄
Tyler you sweetheart i love you so much
HOW MANY PEOPLE LOVES TYLER OAKLEY?
Ok Tyler... I HAVE to go with
1. THIS video because you chose someone very VERY dear to my heart, Lucien (LivinPoetry)
2. The meme pancakes because i can NOT believe you did that kermit, and...
3. The Trixie makeover because you ended up looking like if Trixie and Katya combined into one person ❤️
youve had so many good videos this year omg how can i choose but
1. the whole chosen family series
2. nikki blonsky video OBVIOUSLY
3. cooking with the gays
My favorite Ho Ho Ho sleighing the game!
Anybody else missing the old YouTubers and their funny videos because I sure do😢
Yay, I’m early today. Merry Christmas & happy holidays, everyone! Especially you, Tyler 🎄⛄️ ❄️
omg this video actually made me cry a little especially with all the ones about college...I just started college this fall and I'm so terrified being away from home by myself handling school.
So of course this "Surprising Fans With Gifts" has to be my favorite video you've done this year! I also really really loved "Convincing People on Grindr to Vote" because that's an issue I'm so passionate about advocating for! It's so important for people(especially young people) to step up and vote in their democracies! My third is "Me, the Scammer of Tanacon?", not sure why except it was funny and I legit thought the dude was you at first? Thank you for producing such uplifting and empowering videos, have a great holiday season!!
Gays on ice...Nikki blonsky...lady Gaga surprise....

Happy holidays, Tyler. Enjoy this season!
My favorites would have to be:

1)LGBT Adoption:Redefining Family
2)Queer Brunching
3)Couples Yoga Challenge 

I’m extremely thankful for your Chosen Family series. Thank you for creating such inspiring and uplifting content where there’s a space to talk about the variety of issues and perspectives within the LGBTQ+ Community 💜💜 I’m so happy for your personal growth that we’ve gotten to see in 2018 and can’t wait to see what 2019 has in store for you💜 this is such a sweet video, thank you for doing this!
My three favorites are:
Does Anyone Else Not Know Their Purpose?
Trying to Get Home for Thanksgiving
how i lost my virginity
Tyler you’re honestly amazing! We need more people like you on this planet!!❤️
you are such a beautiful human being tyler this is one of the most sweet videos. this is why you are so special to me... you make the stupidest videos sometimes but its videos like these that really resonate with me. i love you so much angel i hope you have wonderful holidays!! have a good time with the boyfriend and family <3 xx
Hey ily Tyler. I’ve been sick for about a week and you’ve made me a bit better 💖 insta : graceismagi
My three fav videos of 2018 by you are the one where you cooked with the gays, the one where u took a 5th grade test, and the one where you did meme pancake art.

Edit: Oof I don't have twitter
winning that gift card would make a huge difference for me.  im heading off to medical school in another country and have to buy all my school supplies, kitchen tools, bedding, etc.  its incredibly expensive and this gift card would truly help pay for some of the essentials i will need. 

my fave videos of 2018 were 
1) gays doing jingle bell rocks
2) spilling tea with ricky dillon
3) your video with grace
Happy Holidays! As I sit here at midnight in my christmas pajamas watching this I'd have to say that my three favourite videos this year were, as follows and I quote, "Gays on Ice" because figure skating is awesome, "My First Job" because even though I don't work at Mcdonalds I work at five guys so either way it's still burgers, and, even though it's very recent, your video with Trixie because I watched that video and then went onto netflix to continue the episode of rupaul's that I was watching and it was the episode that she was eliminated in! I was very happy when she was brought back
its now been proven; youre actually a softie at heart
Wait this is so cute we stan a king
This video was wonderful, loved the cooking videos with your guy friends, and i LOVED your video with Lady Gaga! This video made my heart so full. Love you Tyler 💜 @jessicabrawley
Thank you for a great year and for giving back to your fans. Your selflessness and positive spirit give me the confidence to embrace who I am. My favorite videos have to be:
1. Weirdest Grindr messages 
2. Cooking with gays
3. Reacting to viral videos

Also loved watching “Going Home.” Such cool insight to your crazy life :)
Hello Tyler, i hope you had a fantastic holidays ❤️ i wanted to tell you thank you for making me laugh through out the year and my three favorite videos were the "Halloween costumes 2018", "Does anyone else not know their purpose?" And "Going back to college" 
Thank you again 😁
Hi!! Loved the kids' reaction! They did not expect that. It melted my little sweet heart😌😂

I probably won't be able to get the give away because I live outside the US (I'm from Costa Rica) and that's ok. But I still want to tell you my three favorite videos of this year:
-Pankake Art Memes
      ✓I'd love to learn more from you cooking skills🥞
-The Harsh Reality of LGBT+ Homeless Youth (Chosen Family Series)
      ✓It surprised me to know that this issue in nowadays' LGBTQ+ reality is still happening and the importance of supporting LGBTQ+ centers and shelters🏳️‍🌈
-Music Festival Looks
      ✓Loved the colors, desigs and the ways to combine 'em. Now I have a long "To buy" list and new outfot ideas for future festivals and other casual events🕺

Happy Holidays,  thank you for being an important part of my year and hope you enjoy your holidays with your family and loved ones😌

#TylerGift100  These are the ones I really liked Tyler.

I just want to say your bubbly personality always makes my bad days turn good.  Thanks buddy!!!!   Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
My three favorite videos from this year were lgbtq+ adopting, queer brunching and growing up gay in rural america. Yes, all are from chosen family, but i could relate to them so much so easily. Earlier this year, i was so far in the closet and preparing to move to a completely different state for the first time in my entire life. In May, I finally came out and in June i moved from New Jersey to the middle of no where in South Carolina. Not only did i move and come out, but i started a gsa and my new school in Myrtle Beach which has already started to make a huge impact on the community. The entire Chosen Family series helped me so much in my journey this year so that is why the three videos listed above are my favorites. Thank you for an amazing year and thank you for helping me so much this year💕
THIS IS SO SWEET I'M MAD THAT I WATCHED THIS SO LATE WHY DIDN'T THIS COME UP IN MY NOTIFS.

Also, it's hard to choose just 3 vids, but the ones I'm gonna choose are this one (cuz my heart is soft and I haven't stop crying), Buying and Reacting to Nikki Blonsky Shoutouts, and the Pancake Art Memes.

Good Luck to everyone who enters!!!! Also even if you weren't one of the people on the video, trust me when I say that all of your worries will one day be a memory.
Omg this feel good shit is so wholesome and amazing. My fave videos this year definitely were the Couple's Yoga, Halloween Costumes, and Skating with an Olympian
my favorite videos you did this year are Spilling YouTube Tea with Ricky Dillon, Pancake Art Memes, and Going Home for Thanksgiving.
This video shows the number one reason I keep answering "Tyler Oakley" when people ask me who inspires me or who my role model is! 

Also, here's my three favorite videos you made this year, in no particular order: 
- "The harsh reality of LGBT homeless youth" (and the entire Chosen Family series tbh...) 
- "Me, The Scammer of Tanacon??"
- "Surprising fans with Lady Gaga"
Haunted Maze, Lady Gaga vid and the 5th graders test
3 fav videos from you were, this one obviously, I love when we help each other in any way we can cause it does make a difference. 
2nd, was the series you did when you went back to your home town & worked your first job & surprised your high school. 
3rd was when you did a premiere with lady Gaga for her new movie (which I still haven’t seen🥺) because she’s my idol. I love her to death, and you of course cause here I am. But those have been my 3 favorite from u this year ❤️
I loved this so much!! my favorite videos of yours this year are 1.) LGBTQ+ roundtable/queer brunch, 2.) music festival lookbook, and 3.) telling people on grindr to vote. 
(I honestly loved all your queer videos this year, they helped me a lot and I learned so much!!! also psychobabble gave me LIFE my first semester of college this year. thanks for bringing me so much joy to a very stressful year). 

merry christmas and happy holidays tyler!! love, carolyn (@gatekeeperxx on twitter)
ugh the way my bitchass is SOBBING at this... i better be starting my period or i really am the biggest crybaby. yikes.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE. whatever u do or celebrate. hope u all stay safe and be kind xoxo
Tyler you're amazing and I am so proud of you and how much you try to make a difference in the life of others. I try and I want to do the same. I hope whoever wins that this helps them this holiday season. Also keep up with the inspirational content Tyler! Merry Christmas. 
VIDEOS THAT ARE HANDS DOWN THE BEST AND PULL AT MY HEART STRINGS
1. The Chosen Family Series
2. Convincing People to vote using Grindr
3. Going back to your hometown/college
omg ty this probably has to be one of my favourite vids from you! so wholesome and nice, an amazing way to end the year <3 <3 i felt so warm after watching this 

1. you’re going home series -- wow that literally gave me goosebumps watching the whole thing sjnfksdkdskdklas
2. this vid -- so adorable and thank you for giving back to the ppl who are having a tough time, sweet thing to do ❤️
3. cooking w/ the gays -- literally kinda cried laughing

honourable mentions - gays attempt 'jingle bell rock', reacting to viral vids and getting ppl on grindr to vote. thanks for this opportunity, love you sm tyler! <3
Hey Tyler! 
I don't know how to choose a favorite 3 because this year,  you have put out so much that I just LOVE! But here they are in order from 3rd favorite to top favorite!!
1: Couples Yoga Challenge
2: Pancake Art Memes (who doesn't love just some fun wholesome memes)
3: OH, and Definitely the WHOLE Going home Series... I couldn't get enough of it. You should def do something like that in the future because now you know you will have at least one viewer!
Well, thank you for such a great year of wholesome laughs and rockin fun! Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, and may 2018 end with a bang! 
-Olivia!
Merry Christmas Tyler! I hope you have the best Christmas ever!
My favorite videos of this year are the going home series (especially the one about your first job), makeovers with queens from "RuPaul's Drug Race" (Monèt X Change - queen💔💔💔) and surprising fans with Lady Gaga
I'd like to say that you have done a great job this year, thank you so much for all your videos and work you've done not only this year but since literally 2007, wow, what a journey
Love this idea! My top 3 are:
1. Harsh reality of LGBT Homeless Youth (Chosen Family s2 e1). That episode helped me figure out what community I wanted to concentrate on with my social work degree that I’m currently working on. 
2. Your Going Home series.
3. Gays On I’ve Olympics Edition ft. Adam Rippon. I LOVE Adam Rippon and I love that you made a video together.
I'm spending Christmas alone this year (again) and have been honestly feeling pretty lonely, especially seeing what a wonderful time everyone else is having and I wanna thank you because this video warmed my heart in the purest, nicest way possible and made me feel much better and reminded me to be happy that I at least get to spend the evening with the choir I sing in and have two concerts with today and tomorrow and it reminded me that actually I'll be spreading some Christmas love and joy through music, which is esentially something I consider to be my vocation. So thank you for that and thank you for all the times you've made my day with your videos, tweets or other posts this year. Thank you for being you and for spreading so much love, positivity and joy.

As for my three favourite videos (very hard to pick 3 by the wAY):
- I can't rly pick ONE so I'm gonna say the entire Chosen Family series (thank you so much for it ♥️) 
- Surprising fans with Lady Gaga 😍
- Surprising my old high school (and the rest from the Going Home series)

Thank you for all the love you've shared through your videos, I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and an even more successful and even happier 2019 ♥️
i honestly have no idea how you expect us to only choose three when none of your videos ever fail to make me smile, but since you insist...
1) definitely this video, it was so heartwarming to see how happy everyone was and just awe
2) your entire "Chosen Family" series, there were definitely some funny and lighthearted moments but these videos are /so/ important because we need to end the horrible stigma surrounding the LGBT+ community and instead bring the awareness and visibility we need (which these videos do wonderfully)
3) Convincing People on Grindr to Vote, because i just honestly adored the entire thing

thank you for everything you do tyler and just continue on being a kickass human being and doing what you do best (making people smile and absolutely slaying life) ❤️
Hi Tyler, your videos have been keeping me going this year at some of the hardest times. So "Does anyone else not know their purpose?" I loved a lot,  but also surprising fans with Lady Gaga and of course your Chosen family series! I love you, keep going and inspiring others (including me)!
My fave vids of the year:
1) Does Anyone Else Not Know Their Purpose? (Really resonated with me as a 21 year old in college, still not having a clue how and if I’m going to contribute to society or make an impact in any way)
2) Gays on Ice w/Adam Rippon (the most iconic collab of 20gayteen, Tonya Harding is quaking)
3) The Adoption episode of the Chosen Family series (I wanted to say the whole series was a fave, but this episode was particularly special and heartwarming. I hope you continue this series next year!)

Tyler, you’re such an amazing creator and I’m so happy to have seen you grow over the past nearly 5 years! Wishing you and your family a merry Christmas and a happy New Year:)
This is such a beautiful video!! The season of giving done right!! And my top 3 videos by you this year? That's a tough one but... 

Loud, Proud, & Fighting Back: Queer Activism Then & Now
Convincing People on Grindr To Vote
And this one!

I think the three of them are important for different reasons, they're also impactful and show not only how awesome you are, but how awesome people in this world can be too! They also remind me to keep being a better person and you can never stop doing enough good in the world. But don't ask me to rank the videos because I love them all the same!
My 3 fav videos are definitely: the cooking with gays, the grinder midterm elections, and ofc the niki blonsky video!!!
This was such a sweet video, they were such great surprises for everyone but the kitty hit a soft spot for me and I loved seeing the kids reaction. I'd have to say my favorite videos for this year were
1. Thank you, next with Grace (it gave me nostalgia for OG youtube)
2. I went to the Olympics (I have an obsession with the Olympics)
3. Does anyone else not know their purpose? (So relatable and made me feel a little better about feeling that way too)

Hope you had a great Christmas and happy new year!
Awesoms, Tyler! Good for you for spreading the love. #karma ! 😬❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Merry Christmas, Tyler! ❤️
This video was so heart warming and it’s great seeing you do such kind things for others.
My three favorite videos of 2018 have been the super bowl drinking game with  Mam
rie, you visiting your high school and I love the Thank U, Next with Grace. Thanks for all of the laughs and positivity.
You’ve been one of my faves for year, and I can’t wait to see what 2019 brings you. 💞
Honestly i loved the chicken bear video just because it was so "tyler wtf you just had an existential crisis in your last video",  Thank u next with Grace helbig because i will always love when you and anyone from the holy trinity collab and because im the biggest Grace fan ever. it's like you're their fourth lil member, and nikki blonsky from the movie hairspray because it was just hysterical and just seeing you cackle over it made me smile. 
Had this included last years videos i would have said you and grace doing the humming challenge, Mamrie hart halloween ASMR, and your nieces and nephews making gingerbread houses with you. Which is maybe one of my favorites of yours? but ok enjoy your life and your holiday.
Tyler that is so kind what you did for so many. It was wonderful the warmth you brought to so many.  I was smiling watching your video. You have a Happy Holiday and take care.
Tyler my best friend tapped on the window of my balcony bathroom. I got a message she was stuck.
My 3 favorite 2018 videos are: Holiday Mrs Clause Transformation w/ Trixie Mattel, DragRace Makeover & Spilling Tea w/ Monét X Change, and How I Lost My Virginity
And I must saw that Grinch Holiday Humming Challenge w/ Grace Helbig was one of my all time favorites! You both looked incredible and the video was hilarious!!!
This is so sweeeeeeet!
MY HEART IS SO FULL 😭😭😭
Aww Tyler you're so amazing.

#TylerGift100
Fave videos were
-Ep 1 of Going Home, The Hometown tour. It was awesome to see you show us around your hometown.
- cat cafe gossip with Colton & Kevin. I loved just seeing you 3 hanging out with cats & talking. So chill& great content

2) Does anyone else not know their purpose (because RELATABLE and also kinda comforting) 
3) Spilling the Tea on making the Chosen Family series (because it makes me appreciate the series all the more)

TYLER!! 
1) Convincing people to vote with grindr (loved all the hilarious convos)

3) I know its recent but damn I love me some Trixie Mattel ("I mean I think it would be hard to be with someone like me if yo-- " "period. end of sentence")
I have also been stalking  since like 2012 (my uni days). I love education but I also loved scrolling when prof. x was getting off topic ahha.
Merry Christmas!
Loved watching you this year! 💕
My favourite videos from you in 2018 are
1. Your recent collab with Trixi Mattel bc I love her and Drag Race
2. Your video surprising lady gaga fans that was super cute
3. The whole chosen family series which is just so special, especially lgbt adoption
Beautiful video! My favorite videos of 2018 you did were:

1. Gays doing jingle bell rocks
2. Gays on Ice
3. The Harsh Reality of LGBT+ Homeless Youth (Chosen Family Series)
I have no friends. That's what's stressing me out. 
Among other things. Many...other things. 😅
Tyler, this was so touching. I love seeing you provide that hope and inspiration to those who need it!! My three fav videos of yours this year were "Convincing People to Vote on Grindr" (iconic), your drag transformation with Trixie (not only is she one of my favs, but your quips together made my life) and your whole Stories of Queer Equivalence series but specifically The Harsh Reality of LGBT homeless youth. I'm hugely into social justice and having that out there for more people to learn about is so important. Thank you for a year of content on your channel and through Psychobabble!! You're amazing!
Thanks for doing this Tyler! <3 

3 favourite videos of 2018:
1. This one!!!
2. Couples yoga challenge
3. Gossiping with Youtube Friends
Hi Tyler!! 👋🏽 
Top 3 favorite videos:
1) Going Home ep 2 with the queen. 
2) LGBTQ homelessness video, quite eye opening. 
3) I am a huge Ru Paul fan, so both Monet Xchange and Trixie videos are at a tie. I laughed so hard at both of them. They bring me joy. 

You also bring me joy. 
Thank you for another year of you!
This video was such a tear jerker😭
My favorite videos of 2018 were
Gays On Ice
the worst grindr messages
and the whole going home series❤️
(and a bonus non-2018 video, getting intimate with Darren Criss BRING HIM BACK😘)
Happy Holidays everyone!!
My top three from this year is super hard cause I'd love to say all of the Chosen Family videos, but only choosing three.
1) Chosen Family: LGBT Adoption; solely because I have family friends who have gone through all of that and are happily living with their daughter now and I'm pretty sure that's what I will end up doing as well.
2) Surprising my old Highschool, since I love going back to mine as well and surprising everyone that's still there. (I'm going back at the beginning of January to do it again)
3) Gays on Ice ft Adam Rippon cause that is. Fab.U.Lous!
OK, top three favorite videos of the whole year? Gonna be tough but I'll try 😅
1. Does anyone else not know their purpose? (I know, starting off super fluffy lol)
2. Buying and reacting to Nikki Blonsky video shoutouts (this was what I was watching when the frikkin Mormon missionaries came knocking and I find that hilarious)
3. Convincing people on Grindr to vote (best way to get people out and voting tbh)
Awe! Tyler your such a SWEETHEART, your such an amazing person for doing this! Happy Holidays ❤️
(Just saying my Twitter is @nolansyogurt 😂❤️) Love you so much and once again Thank you
happy holidays Tyler! 
my favorite videos from 2018 was the whole “Going Home” series because Michigan Represent! also the DIY chicken teddy bear was definitely interesting but we respect that. And who can forget the gays recreated jingle bell rock because that was just ICONIC. I hope you’re having a wonderful holiday season! :) 
twitter - @kalihollinshead
My 3 favorite videos were gays on ice: olympic edition (ft. Adam Rippon); Loud, Proud, & Fighting Back: Queer Activism Then & Now; and Growing Up Gay in Rural America: Creating a GSA in Kansas. I ended up using the latter of the videos in a project for my education department on how schools are creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBTQIA+ students, comparing policies and studies to media. What I found was studies showed that being mindful of the queer community helps students, but policies and media show that not all schools are following through. Thanks for creating fun but also informative content. Happy Holidays!
Hi Tyler! Merry Christmas! That flipping Dan and Phil thing was so nice, made me cry. The whole video made me emotional tbh
My favorite videos of yours from this year are 
1. Are you smarter than a 5th grader?
2. Convincing people to vote on grindr
3. The whole chosen family series, I couldn't choose one
The holidays are extremely hard for me but this lifted my spirits today. I wish the best for all of these lovely humans. 
My favorite 3 videos you've made this year have to be from your Chosen family series, the one about the aids crisis, lgbtq+ homelessness, and adoption....I truly feel like I learned so much watching those and it made me want to learn so much more about my community, and I feel like I did that this year, I seeked out more information and you were a big part of that. 
Happy Holidays Tyler. 💓💫
My top 3 videos in no specific order have to be.... 🤔 
•gays on ice: olympics edition (ft. Adam Rippon)
•The Harsh Reality of LGBT Homeless Youth 
•CONVINCING PEOPLE ON GRINDR TO VOTE 

Thanks for all the good content this year 😌 happy holigays 🥰
love of my life
I’ve literally spent 15 minuets scrolling through your videos to remember which ones you posted this year (2018 really has lasted eight entire years).

Anyway my faves were:

1) THIS ONE because Fingofin the cat made me actually cry. 

2) the going home video where you worked at your old McDonald’s job ONLY because of “Xavier what’s the tea?” “What’s the what???”

3) hEy itS NiKki bLonSki

Happy holidays Tyler!!

Hey Tyler! Choosing my videos from 2018 was DIFFICULT!! But I have widdled it down to my top three of 2018. Three of my favorite videos from 2018 were "Trying to Get Home for Thanksgiving," "Cooking with the Gays" and the "Roller Disco Party" from your Chosen Family series. Thank you for making content for your fabulous viewers (including yours truly). I hope you have an excellent, yuletide gayful holiday season!
3 favorite videos of 2018

1 of course this one it made me cry when the kids knew they ya da pizza party! It warmed my heart. 

2. Surprising fans with Lady Gaga

3. Couple yoga 

All are my fav but these got the top of the list🙌🏽
Tyler, you are such an amazing person! I hope you have a wonder holiday season with your friends and family! 

My favorite videos of 2018 would have to be: the Going Home series (especially Working a day at my first job), Chosen Family, and the Chicken teddy bear.
my 3 favorite all have very special meaning to me:

the first is the chosen family series episode on adoption. even before i knew that there was a possibility that i won’t have children and that i could end up with a woman i wanted to adopt. i loved the narration and the positive vibes.

my second is the calling your representatives (was it this year?) i am an activist that works closely with women’s march and worked on the team for march for our lives. calling representatives is so important!! and you boosted our numbers by thousands!!

the last and most important would have to be the roller skating one. now if you look closely in the thumbnail (or not so closely lmao) you can see... you guessed it! Me! i’m the one with the awfully ruffed up hair and bi “tears”!! that night was the best night of my life. i made so many lasting friends, and we plan on continuing the tradition next year!!!!! thank you for giving us that amazing opportunity and have a happy holidays!
xoxo, Riley

Loved this video! I love it when people use their channels for good. 

My favorite videos from your channel in 2018 were the gays on ice one abut the olympics, you going back to college in your going back home series, and the LGBTQ+ round table in your chosen family series (I learn a lot from that series that I don’t learn in school. It makes my gay heart happy).
Happy holidays! 

I haven't had much time for youtube lately, BUT! Of all the videos i got time to watch i really enjoyed a lot from the Chosen Family series of yours. And everything with grindr is fun so "Your worst grindr messages" and "convincing people on grindr to vote" really stuck with me. Genius!

Thanks a lot 😊

2.- Surprising fans with Lady Gaga (gaga and you, iconic)
3.- Pancake art memes
You are so great !! I loved all of the chosen family series. Loved your going home series and your drag make overs. My list can keep going. Love every time you and Grace get together. The Jingle Bell Rock video had me laughing for hours. Anyway love all your videos. I am patiently waiting on your next book. I listen to Binge on the way to work every night it calms me before going in to work!!!
I loved the Chosen Family series like everyone else did...but besides that my three faves are:
1) Cute Boys and Cats
2) Buying and Reacting to Nikki Blonsky Video
3) Does Anyone Else Not Know Their Purpose 
The third video I liked really helped me this year and meant a lot to me, because at 29 years old it’s rough, but this video helped me see I’ll be okay.
My favourite three videos have been "does anyone not know their purpose" because seeing someone I admire admit the same struggles really hit me, "cooking with the gays" because it was hilarious and this video because it was so beautifully kind. I have loved all your content this year, including the podcast. Keep killing it!
urgh okay i gotta pick onlyyyyyy threeeeee. okay let’s go:

Hey Tyler, 
My favourite videos from your channel are the Halloween costumes (loved the Ariana Grande costume, you rocked that!), your morning routine, cooking with gays( that was so good) and your ten things you can’t live without video. You have inspired me so much through out the years I’ve been watching you. I hope you have a great 2019. Hope you read my comments. But I know you have a lot. Thank you for putting a smile on face with every video you post. 😅😘
hey tyler, i hope you have a great holiday & i find you using this space to reconnect with your fans like you have been before, really makes a lot of peoples day. you’re very inspiring and one of the original youtubers i still watch to this day. my favorite videos you have done in 2018 are “Surprising fans with LadyGaga” which I love her to death, I love how outgoing she is and how she likes to make a fashion statement that nobody would ever do. I also like “spilling the tea” with RickyDillion, Ive been watching him since O2L, and he has just been the nicest person anyone could have as a friend. The third best one I love is the “Thank U next” video you made which made me laugh the whole time ❤️😊 Thanks for being yourself because you are a great light in everyones lives.
Cooking with the gays 
Thank u, next 
And pancake art memes 
Are my favourite video of mine you made this year! Love you Tyler, hope you’ve had an amazing day and had an amazing Christmas❤️
By far my favorite videos of 2018 were:
1. Watching old high school musical w/ Dolan (it’s comforting to watch someone be able to look back at their past with happiness)
2. LGBT: Redefining Family (this one sits close to home because I know when day I’ll go through this)
3. Recreating the viral chicken teddy bear (iconic)
this was so sweet of you!! i'm really glad i stan someone as wholesome as you & i can't thank you enough for making my days better and continuously inspiring me to be a nicer and better human being to others and for myself too 💞 love u so much !!!!
i hope you have wonderful holidays filled with love and happiness ✨
My top three videos:
1. This one because it's just super adorable 
2. "Buying & Reacting to Nikki Blonsky Video Shoutouts" because it was hilarious
3. Can I choose the entire chosen family series? I can't choose between "LGBT Adoption: Redefining Family" and "Growing Up Gay in Rural America: Creating a GSA in Kansas" because I definitely want to adopt when I'm older and I'm super interested in starting GSAs at other schools that don't have them and need them (I'm actually working with my old middle school to get theirs started now.)
Love you!
First of all you are everything!!! I loved the Chosen Family series, Gaga’s magical appearance as well and This one made my heart smile 🤩💜

my three favorite videos from you this year definitely had to be the chosen family series, the going home series, and the video with adam rippon. the two series definitely resonated with me, specifically the chosen family one, since i came out to my whole family in june of this year, after being in the closet for almost 8 years. Your going home series was amazing to see how humbling you are and taught me to appreciate and be grateful for everything in my hometown that i experience before i eventually move out, and the adam rippon video obviously because hes a queen. i love you and i hope you consider me for this gift card! my twitter is @glittertimess 💓🌟

Okay I was HERE for your content this year. It just felt like we saw you develop and grow into a “better you” and for someone that’s been here with you for 5 years, it’s bitter sweet. If I had to choose 3 videos, it would be 1.The Going Home series (especially the video with you and Dolan) 2. Obviously Chosen family (in particular, the one where you went to the safe place for teens/youth) 3. Last but not least, this video! I think it’s so thoughtful and sweet of you to be spreading a little joy and love this holiday season! ❤️

Merry Christmas Tyler x
Jingle bell rock video was definitely a favourite of mine but the chicken teddy bear video and of course this one were great too!!
So happy you did that to your fans! I was drowning with finals when you tweeted this so I was off social media for a while to focus and I wished I could’ve been a part of this.

My three favorite videos you made this year were:
1. the worse grindr messages i’ve ever received
I was shook because there was a small YouTuber I knew about who you featured and he made a video watching that part and I couldn’t believe you interacted with him!
2. ME, THE SCAMMER OF TANACON??
YOU REVEALED YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND AND I WAS SCREAMING AND QUOTE TWEETED YOUR VIDEO AND YOU LIKED THAT TWEET AND THE SCREAMING DIDN’T STOP THERE!
3. Surprising Fans with Lady Gaga
‘A Star Is Born’ has become my all time favorite movie and having you AND Lady Gaga there for fans was the most heartwarming thing!
Hey Tyler, thank you so much for making this video! This made my morning x

It's Christmas here in New Zealand, so happy Christmas and happy holidays to you and all your loved ones, Tyler! As for my favourite videos of this year, I've loved the whole Chosen Family series, the Trixie Holiday transformation and your Gays on Ice video with Adam Rippon.
My favorite videos are the couples yoga one,the olympics one and the one am commenting below rn.😊
I do not have a twitter.☹
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.❤
Hey Tyler it warms my heart w/all the ways you are helping to make even a tiny piece of the planet better. Which is needed more than ever in the current state of our country. 
I'm doing this not for me but for my hubby. He is the only one working to support both of us & our 3 service furbabies. I have been fighting for disability since 2013, fkn red tape. He is my best friend before all & the most amazing man I could ever been blessed with. If I am blessed enough to recieve one of the gift cards it be used entirely for him. He is working towards going from guard to armed guard. Since our rent takes 3/4 of his monthly earnings & then there's are basic needs like dog food, ppl food, & bus passes for work & all my doctors appt. Plus I just found out that my spine if a lot worse than 1st thought & I will be in the hospital in a few weeks for a week long neurological study. So the stress level has got to be twice as hard for him than he lets on. He was even considered taking out a loan just to get tickets for my best friend/older sister to see Superfruit in Vegas but I wouldn't let him. Sorry so long winded. You'd think that weeks away from being 41 I should be more settled in life. Gurl that's a lie. Any way here are my 3 fave this year. Sorry I'm bad at names.
1. Big gay ice cream party.
2. When you helped provide support to a small town teen w/a dream of creating a safe space in his school.
3. When you got together w/other community members for dinner & the topic of gay spaces not being truly handicap friendly. 
Loved your pumpkin spice fast food video, ‘working a day at my old job’ and all of the chosen family videos :)
ok I'm crying thank u for doing all of this tyler
I’m giving in, @twitter. 
1. ‘Going Home’.... memories.
2. ‘Drag’.... Tyler expressing himself.
3. ‘THIS ONE’.... It shows how much he cares 💛
My favorite videos from this year have been drag race makeover and spilling tea, I went to the Olympics, and surprising fans with gaga!!
How many times did I said... don't make choose from your babies 😒😒
I love them all !!!!
Can I say every video??? (Minus the chicken teddy bear) if I had to pick it would be 1) surprising fans with gifts (this video was just wow! I can see while it made you emotional editing it!) 2)  Does anyone else not know their purpose (it was just very relatable and I think it was very helpful :) and finally 3) ALL OF THE COMING HOME SERIES and CHOSEN FAMILY DUH
LIKED HOLIDAY MRS CLAUSE DRAG TRANSFORMATION/GAYS ATTEMPTING JINGLE BELL ROCK/WORKING A DAY AT MY FIRST JOB MC DONALDS
I'ma cry 😢 Bless your heart Tyler. Merry Christmas
Favorites from this year: Gays on Ice, Mrs. Claus Drag, and the whole Chosen Family series was really great. Bonus favorite: this video. It makes me happy to see there are people that are willing to take the good they have been given and pass it on to others. Happy holidays, Tyler. <3
I loved this video and the series where you went back to your highschool
My top favorite video is 'How to be a Trans Ally'. I'm trans and it makes me incredibly happy knowing you made a video like that. The other two videos I'd say I like are the ones when you get dressed up in drag! I love drag queens and Kings. All are so fabulous!

Hi, Tyler! I love everything that you do for the community. I wrote a report on you because you are my role model. ❤️
My three favorite videos are:
1. Surprising fans with gifts 
2.going home videos 
3. Chosen family series (because I can’t pick just one video
1. The Lady Gaga movie premiere!
2. The one where you went back to McDonalds!!

Those are in no particular order!
My 3 favorite videos were episodes 01, 03 & 05 of the second season of your Chosen Family videos. Happy Holidays, love and light~
❤️ Tyler clause. Thanks for spreading the joy!
It’s so hard to pick my 3 fav videos so I’ll go with the ones that made me cry cause they were so wonderful.

So this one hands down, it’s amazing what you’ve done for these people.

Your gaga video, when she got emotional at the screening, my heart was so full. You and gaga holding hands, I can’t it was everything!!

Mind you I didn’t cry fully but I would have cause it was so cute, was the video of you skating with Adam! The chemistry there, loved it!!

Also honourable mention and not cause it made me emotional but I’m obsessed with the video of you dressing up for Halloween, you as Ariana Grande might be the most iconic moment of the year!!

Love you!!

Can’t wait to see what 2019 brings for you. 😘💙
It’s been 4 years since I watched Tyler why I stopped watching him I didn’t know I’m here now
I cannot stress how much I love the voting/grindr video, I’m super into voting and also gay and you did hella right by that
Happy everything, man..
Everyone, have a happy time!!

Stress is real this holiday season. This Christmas will be the first Christmas away from home! I’m here alone in LA, while the rest of the fam is back home in Minnesnowta. On top of student loans, bank loans, upcoming hospital bills and eventual car payments, and nonstop work at my own job, I’m taking these two days to just BREATHE, watch Christmas movies, drink the nog, cook the ham, and RELAX and just be thankful to be alive and healthy. Merry Christmas to you all in the comments!!! ❤️🎊🎉🍾🎄
Tyler you are such a kind soul. The world needs more people like you. Thank you for doing this.

Ok, well my number one video is this one, because this is the wholesome content the world needs right now. Then I’d have to say gays on ice. Who doesn’t love Adam Rippon? And then I can’t choose a favorite out of the whole series, so I’ll say Chosen Family as a whole! 🌈❤️
I wish I saw this tweet earlier  I've been in the hospital for a month

This is the sweetest thing!!<3
My three favorite videos were gays on ice ft Adam Rippon, reacting to kpop, and convincing people on Grindr to vote!!
My TOP 3!!!
- creating a GSA in Kansas (my 1st time commenting after years of watching ur videos!! That video was so inspiring)
- convincing people on Grindr to vote 
- trying to get home for thanksgiving 
- bonus!!: showing skin at Coachella 

I really want to thank you for being an empowering individual, leading by example by being proactive in effecting changes. (GSA and Grindr voting video) Thank you for being sincere and vulnerable with us (thanksgiving video) and I also just love how you have such a healthy relationship with your body now especially after reading about the body image issues you had  in binge, we love a character development!!    You were the 1st YouTuber I ever watched and I’m just so Glad to witness the growth of not just your channel but you as an individual. Maybe one day I can be just as cool as you are and even see you in person AHHHHH love u!! <3
I think my favorite videos this year were 1) Surprising fans with Lady Gaga 2) The entire Going Home series, because I would love to go back to my hometown and 3) Does anyone else not know their purpose? I really relate to the last one especially because I’m at a somewhat rough time in my life, figuring out what to do next.
ty nobody can name of your vids that they actually liked in the past year
my favorite ones are the trixie mantel drag make over and the morning routine and the surprising  fans with lady gaga
LOVE this video Tyler!! This season is All about GIVING. Merry Christmas to you and a VERY and SUCCESSFUL 2019!!!😘❤️🎄💚🎄🍷🍷🎄⛄️⛄️❄️
LGBT adoption, going back to college, and working at your first job still remains my favorite videos from you uwu
THIS WARMED MY HEART WHAT THE HELL TYLER? this ain’t allowed sis you’re tooooo precious
Such wholesome content 😊😊 My favorite videos you made this year are: the Halloween costumes video, the pumpkin spice fast food mukbang, and cooking with the gays
I just watched the liveshow! OML I love you so much ahhhh
Best videos this year:
1. Couples yoga challenge 
2. Pancake art memes
3. Convincing people on grinder to vote
Chosen Family series! Going Home series! jingle bell rock dance!
Love the Mrs. Clause video.  The guy pile in the Los Vagas video was so funny.  I don't have a third video
TYLER YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!
Okay .... 
I LOVE YOU 😭😭😭
I have spent a long time trying to think of my favorite videos from this year, and I can honestly say that in order, they are 
1- not knowing your purpose
2- working first job for a day
and
3- ice cream social

The first one really spoke to me in a way that videos don’t often do. Like, personally, it’s not too easy for me to find someone that can articulate things I feel when I can’t, but man, you always have. That’s a big reason I love binge so much. You just have this thing, that idk man, I just really feel like I can resonate with what you have gone through, and what you say. And with everything else,, these series’s this year, it’s been great. I love seeing what you can create, and both have made 2018 just that little bit much better. ANYWAYS this has been long enough, but I hope you don’t mind me sharing my long rambling thoughts. Love ya Tyler, can’t wait to see what you come up with next ❤️
-kai
Thais a lovely video Ty! Merry Christmas to you and yours 😘
hey tyler! it’s so sweet of you for what you’re doing for people! i actually have a rare autoimmune disorder so it would mean a lot if i could win! 
MY 3 FAVORITE VIDEOS FROM 2018 ARE:
1) Gays Attempt “Jingle Bell Rock”
2) Working a Day At My First Job (McDonalds)

ILYSMMM
Imagine having Tyler as a teacher
I loved all your videos in 2018
My favorite videos were the gay pride roller disco party, cooking with the gays, and the thank you next video
My favorite videos were “my morning routine” because it was nice seeing you do something a little different, second is “does anyone else not know their purpose?” Because I’m also in a few odd months where I don’t know where I’m going. Third was this one because I loved how you came up with this idea and it helped so many people for so many different purposes. Thank you Tyler!
PRIME EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WITH A PLATFORM USING IT FOR GOOD

I loved that your content became so much more meaningful this year. Loved seeing the different series you created, but I was especially moved by your Going Home series and LGBT series. My three standouts are:

1. LGBT youth
2. Growing up gay in rural America 
3. Going home to your high school

Honorable mention goes to your McDonald’s video because that girl was EVERYTHING. Here’s to an even better 2019. Lord knows I could use it after the toughest year I’ve faced in a while. 

Thanks for always being there!
these are truly the most iconic videos of 2018:
1. this one
2. gays attempt "jingle bell rocks" 
3. working a day at my first job
TYLER, YOU NEED TO COLLAB WITH DAN AND PHIL AGAIN the phandom have been asking for this for a while. your previous collabs with them are iconic we all love them i need to see another one.
How these kids freak out over the pizza party is just so sweet!
Tyler you're so sweet! I really love how you're such a considerate person, and it made me so happy to see the pure joy on everyone's faces. This is such a sweet thing to do. ❤️
I loved jingle bell rock, my morning routine and impressions with helium.

This gift card would mean so much to me, I recently had a personal issue happen in the family and I would love to help them out the best I can. 

1.) Pumpkin Spice Muckbang
2.) 100 things in 2017
3.) Exposing Twitter drafts

Those are the 3 favorites I’ve watched! Enjoy all of your videos though!
Love you
hi tyler my name's eli im @palayepaege on twitter. I've loved all your videos this year as its been really nice to see you laugh and be yourself, you really cheered me up a lot this year.
my top 3 videos tho are:

baking with the gays, as it was such a funny one to watch i remember clicking on it at like 3am one night as i had just had a massive meltdown from school and life stress and really needed a laugh.

skating with an Olympian, adam rippon has been somebody i have watched online for a long time and he was the one who inspired me to get back into ice skating and tho im on a break right now because of school im going to pick it up after my exams and try really hard again

okay so my #1 is more of a more special video to me as on the 21st of august i came out as bisexual to my friends and family on facebook, it was the night before going back to school and i was just sat crying myself to sleep as i put the post up at like 5am because i felt as though i couldn't go another school year hiding my true self to those around me. That video helped calm me down while i was sat crying having a panic attack ranting to my best friend and regretting the post but i put on your video as a distraction and im so glad i got the notification when i did else i probably wouldn't be out to anybody now.

i love you and i hope you've had a good holiday 💙
the video message from dnp wasn’t even to me and i started tearing up wtf these two giants mess w my heart
omg this made me cry so much but also when tyler meowed at the cat? TOO PRECIOUS
Hey Tyler!
1st video: Music Festival Lookbook (because I ran into you at Grandoozy)
2nd video: super bowl drinking game with Mamrie Hart
3rd video: working at McDonalds (from coming home)

Hope you had an amazing holiday season and an even better 2019! :)
can't possibly but them in an order from worst to best but

nikki blonsky
pancake art
and the entire going home series but if i have to pick one from the series probably working a day at my first job

love you tyler!!! :)
Omg Tyler this was so nice of you ❤️❤️
My favs:
1) TRIXIE 
2) Monet X Change

My favorite videos of yours (besides this one) that you posted this year were: Pancake Art Memes, Throwing a Gay Pride Roller Disco Party, and Cat Cafe Gossip Session.
Okay, damn, that's so adorable! I'm so happy for dhar, love that for her!!
My three favorite videos were 
1. The whole Chosen Family Series
2. Halloween Costume choices because they were ALL iconic...
3. And probably the video where you encouraged us all that it’s okay if we don’t know what we are doing with our lives, because life is an uphill battle. I love you ty ✨🎁💛
Wait I didn't know tyler was that ripped
The kids were so happy for that pizza ommmg!!
Tylerrr, this is so sweet! I hope you get many more views on this and inspire so many more people :,)
this is so sweet! i love you so much
I hope you have a wonderful Christmas Tyler

Who else is here from keem's tweet
Queer brunching: An LGBTQ+ Roundtable chat, gays Attempt “JINGLE BELL ROCK”, and 10 things I can’t live without. Btw I loved more videos but i tried to resist outing over 50+ videos titles in this.
Sending virtual hug 🤗
this made me cry and smile so much omg i love this
Aww this is so sweet I’m crying 😭 my favourite videos of yours from this year apart from this one we’re couples yoga, drag race makeover and working at my first job for a day. Sorry if I didn’t get those titles 100% correct I don’t remember the actual titles 😅
Happy holidays!! I hope 2019 treats you well.
I'd have to say my favorite videos of yours this year have been Cooking with the Gays, you eating all that fast food pumpkin spice, and oh hum how about Suprising Fans with Lady Gaga. You know, so casually. It's only LADY GAGA.
favorite videos: money x change drag makeup video? the chicken bear, and the lady gaga surprises video!!
All of the chosen family videos, thank you, next and when you went back to McDonald’s!!
This year I loved:
- Not knowing your purpose (relatable)
- DIY Chicken Teddy Bear (rIdIcUlOuS)
- Gays attempting Jingle Bell Rock ("SLAY" - TO 2014)

TBH, i found your channel in 2015 and watched nearly all your videos! This year I got a Custodial job and so I also listened to every episode of Psychobabble! I love how genuine you are ❤ thanks for all you do!
This is the sweetest thing ever!!!!!
Yaaaaaaaas this vid was so cuteeee 🥰 well my 3 fave vids of 2018 were • Pumpkin Spice Everything • Suprising fans with Gaga • festival look book ☺️🥳 hope you have the best Christmas ty!!!! 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼 frommmm liv x
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUUUUUL
HAPPY HOLIGAYS!!,
Love this so much <3 my fav videos are gays on ice, the 4 minute Halloween costumes and this video! You're just so generous and caring! I love you so much
My three favorite videos of yours this year are 100% all from your wonderful Chosen Family mini series. Of course I loved them all for their information and education but my favorite three were 1) The activism then and now video 2) The roller disco and 3) The roundtable video. All such truly wonderful and meaningful videos ❤️ I hope to see the series make a return in 2019!
this video just warmed my heart and made me cry.
Oh my god. Um, I know it's after Christmas, and you probably won't get this, but Tyler...I swear. You literally are the kindest person ever. You are one of the few people who taught me that being bisexual, Chinese, and a girl is more than okay, and that I shouldn't change at all. 
In case you do see this, I love you, keep doing what you're doing, I hope you had a great holiday, and I look forward to seeing your up coming (hopefully in Disneyland?) videos! :)
i loved all of your videos this year but if i had to choose, my 3 favorites would be:
1. surprising fans with lady gaga
2. superbowl drinking game
3. gays try jingle bell rock

i’m super grateful that you’re doing this!!
This video was so wholesome <3
I LOVE THIS VIDEO IT MADE ME SMILE SO MUCH OMG
You are literally the best person alive
ooo i’d have to go with 1) gays on ice 2) going home series and i k ow you said pick three but the whole series made my heart melt. 3) the last minute halloween costume video that was very fun!
This was so sweet 💜
awww that was so beautiful and sweet ♥
I have been actively watching your weekly videos for over 5 years now, but my favorites from this year are
1- Your drag makeover videos! I feel they always teach so much about drag culture and depicts that it’s all about self expression
2- YOUR video of Lady Gaga’s “100 people in a room” (that kills me EVERY TIME)
3- And finally, the cooking with the gays video, because it shows that there’s so much you can do as a queer apart from drinking and night life! I don’t like drinking, nor do I feel comfortable in night life- so that was an oddly inspirational video for me as a foodie!
I loved this video! my fave videos of 2018 (in no particular order) are: 

1 Surpising Fans with Gifts 
2 The whole chosen family series (I can't pick one, they all are perfect and precious)
3 Surprising fans with Lady Gaga (AAH AAAAH ASSWDDEAJH AAAAAAAAAAAAH)
4 Morning routine (NOW I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN I WASH THE BACK OF MY EARS, your impact!!!!)
5  gays on ice (how i was introduced to adam rippon)
6 When you worked at McDonalds (aka your first job)
7 Your last minute halloween customes (yes ponytail! yuh yuh)
8  Drag Race makeover with Monét X Change
9 You trying to get home for thanksgiving (because i love when you vlog)
10 cat cafe gossip session because this year i found out i don't actually  dislike cats and also i love Kevin and Colton.

CAN'T WAIT FOR 2019! LOVE U!!!!
Has anyone seen there are some hickeys on his neck! xoxoxo Tyler having a good time with his bf :)
i looooved the mean girls jingle bell rock dancing with the gays, grindr midterm elections, and this video!
I'm here from Phil retweeting Tyler's tweet. Its funny because I used to watch you in middle school so much. You were a life line for little gay me for long enough that I outgrew your kind of content. Just back here to say thank you helping me grow up all those years ago.
My favorite videos this year would probably be "convincing people to vote on grindr", "pancake art memes", and "cooking with the gays". You're so inspiring, hilarious, and generous. I love everything that you do for people, and I hope to be able to make as big of a positive impact on people as you one day!!
This guy was blowing up what happened
This is adorable!
You are an amazing person
this is so sweet omg ):
He’s too cute
Loveed this video and actually inspired me to raise money for my mom because she battled cancer this year and has now less money because of all the treatments and everything. My favorite Tyler Oakley's videos this year were (not in order) : Working at my first job (McDonald's) ; Recreating the viral chicken teddy bear ; Holiday Mrs. Claus drag transformation (ft. Trixie Mattel). Hope you have a Merry Christmas with your family and friends !!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying!!

Tyler got turned into Katya and Trixie's child.
Trixie finally found someone who Interupts someone as much as she does😂

The face of utter terror from your gardener. The pink one so terrify.
You look like Trixie and Katya's daughter 😂
Trixie: I'm from Wisconsin. So I grew up in the country-country.

Tyler low-key flirting with Trixie is giving me life. She just ignores it completely 😂
Trixie Mattel selling real estate as a reality show on VH1!!!!  Make it happen!!!!
Tyler's arms are making me thirsty
I don't know how to process the fact that Trixie's makeup on Tyler Oakley is apparently Bianca Del Rio
as a lesbian i can 100% confirm that trixie is the lesbian dream. folk music, feminine fantasy, heart of gold, comedy queen, dolly parton, plays a weird instrument, what more could we want 😍😍😍😍

Ok what when did Tyler get SO buff.... I’m living
Trixie Mattel, aka Caliou with fetal alcohol syndrome, is so incredible! I always love watching her because she contrasts humor with serious topics and I admire her because of it. ❤

Tyler and Trixie are definitely a force to be reckoned with! Loved watching this mini interview and getting to watch Tyler pick her brain with different topics.
TRACY MARTEL
I came for  the pink shag covering Trixie. It called to me.

Tyler ended up looking like a Trixie + Katya + a Mom acting like a teenager + a little touch of Barbara Streisand in the 80's with the curly hair.
Your skin is beautiful!
Tyler: you are cute!
Trixie : I’m not
ME: YOU ARE THE CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD BARBARA!

TRIXIE
Awww watching this and Tyler mentions rollerblading! Legitimately had to buy a fanny pack back in the day when Tyler talked about rollerblading and wore fannypacks in his first vids! 😍
Tyler Oakley is the new James St James 😍 loving it
Damn Tyler 😍😍 going Clark Kent/Superman on US
i love seeing you two become more comfortable around eachother as the video progresses. the atmosphere changes at a certain point :)
Trixie: Uhm... I find her horrifying..
Tyler: - laughs like it's the last day he's living -
This reminds me of the video where you said "welcome to the stage drag queen herself, sally Manila"😂😂😂
THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR
i LOOOVE trixie now but is it bad that I have like no memory of her in drag race 😅
Yuck, I see what Mark Dice was talking about. I've seen enough.
Am I the only one who think Tyler in drag looks like Yuhua Hamasaki ? haha
Tyler is so shady!!! YOOO!! 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏
Tyler: No expense was spared
Trixie: I spared every expense!
Love you Tyler ❤️✨ you’re so inspirational

Someone in the comments called Tyler a muscle daddy  o wow

I haven't watched you in a while and you have definitely gained some muscle and it makes me happy that Trixie is from Wisconsin as I am also a Wisconsin native and I have been delving into becoming a drag king, so it's nice to see a drag role model

I know exactly the gelsons trixie is referring to... the one across the street from basix next to weho city hall
So I haven't watched a Tyler Oakley video in about two or three years and I was SO EXCITED to see his video pop up on recommended. Then I click the video and WHAT THE HECK MR. OAKLEY, WHEN DID YOU GET SO BUFF?!?!? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MCSONALDS CHICKEN NUGGET CHALLENGE?!?

I am so glad trixie said Tyler looked like Bianca because I was going to say the same!!!!
Ohhhhh Honeyyyyyyy, that’s hair on Tyler. Shady Miss Trixie. 😂
I love this so much😂
As a fellow queen, it makes me feel so happy that even stars like trixie are humble enough to do a make up tutorial wearing a sleeve with an unfinished jagged edge
LOVE THIS, my two idols combined. POWERFUL ENERGY
Omg I love Trixie Mattel
love u
PUHLEASEEEE, Next line of merch "Tixie Mattel Barbie Dream Home Realty"

Tyler’s had some gainz
Tyler is hitting on trixie so much omg

That wig on Tyler looks horrific. Trixie has said that her look is great hair and cheap outfits. So Tyler got cheap and cheap?
The makeup creeped me out but it stayed 💕
I live near Dollywood it’s actually the best place if you haven’t gone go. Although I’ve never left Tennessee and don’t have other theme park experiences, I love it more than anything!
I love how Trixie used the James Charles palette
When did Tyler get that glow up ?

Ooooh yesss Trixie is using the new James Charles pallette
Goddamn tyler 😱 wow
Tyler’s channel is like a ghost town now how sad
Omg trixie mattel used the James Charles x Morphe Artistry palette.
My crush on Brian continues to confuse my sexuality...in and out of face💗
Tyler calling all the gays via Trixie to revive his channel
at the end tyler looks like trixya's daughter lmao

I used to stan Tyler for YEARS but for the past year or so I’ve been out of the loop but damn it’s good to see he’s still killing it 💕
Tyler looks like Bianca 😂😂😂
39 hours of Gaga huh? Not enough.
why does Trixie makeup turn Tyler into Bianca Del Rio instantly
won all stars by default
I prefer Tyler not Trixied
Tyler’s ripped 🔥 damnnnn
YES EVAH!!!! PLEASE!!!
This WeHo boy is fully cooked.

Is it too late to get a heart? :)

Tyler. When did you get that body?! Omg.
he looks exactly like Tempest
2 of my favs!! Katya next please!
omg shes using James' palette
Tyler is a makeup artists worst nightmare lmfao. He's super emotive with his face and hands and is constantly moving during application. I would have been sweating bullets doing his makeup afraid to slip up.
Tyler I love this yass
Why does Tyler without lipstick look like tempest dujour
Do I spot sister James's palette?????
Mask for masc 🎭
Why does Tyler took like tempest dujour with only the brown eyeshadow and brows?
Tyler looks like Bianca omg.
oh my god when did tyler get hot
I work part time at a library and we've got a reading programme going right now where the kids have to read a certain amount of books and come in and tell us about each one so we know they read it, answering our questions and such. Anyway I overhear my manager talking to this kid and she asks him, 'oh, does your dad love drag racing?' and this kid is like yeah! so much! and i'm like iN THIS LITTLE TOWN? anyway turns out they were talking about cars
Damn Tyler I didn't check on him for a while he look like a snack 😍 hey muscledaddy
Ooh you look like a mix of Katya and Bianca !
Damn :/ he really lost a lot of views
Glad his been watching the Muppets
Uh trixie hugged you like twice willingly???? Bless you really are special. This video was everything
NOT DEB OIVHBGB HILARIOUS
It's TRIXIE! my queen
Tyler! Those arms girl!!!!
not even Trixie could save your channel
Tempest Dujour?
i haven’t watched tyler since like 2014 , only clicked cause of trixie, when did he get so buff ????
OMG! i havent seen tyler in a while and im gagging over his body hottieeeeeeeeeeee!
15:35 he’s really breaking his neck
I say this is as good as Holi-Slay
He didn’t say Willam
Tyler looks good af
still so weird to see tyler with muscles. not mad tho.
Is she using the James Charles pallet?? 😏😏
this is the cutest 😍
i stole farrah’s emo boys pics once for a myspace page so that’s v tru
Is Mrs Bianca Claus 😂
Do a video with a non Drag Race queen next time too to spread the love. You got suggested enough of them on twitter.
This was an unexpectedly nice and hilarious video. Trixie is so lovely. Tbh drag for me comes to close to masks and clown-esque looks and therefore I find it kinda scary. Do totally respect it as an art though, definitely takes a lot of talent and effort. :)
This is what I didn’t know I needed in my life
Wait Farrah Moan is Cameron Ugh BOY WHAT
I love Trixie so much
okkkkkk tyler looking FITTTT
I STOPPED EVERYTHING I WAS DOING TO WATCH THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Ok now tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Who's your trainer and when all this started.
12:04 is hard the James Charles x Morphe Eyeshadow palette??!!
Such Bianca vibes!!! 😂😭
Major disconnect between getting beefed up and still being a flamboyant femme.
This video added 5 years to my life.
Caillou with fetal alcohol syndrome GOODBYE 😂😂😂😂😂
I live for Trixie
the duo i never thought i needed!
Tracy Marcel’s hair is iconic
He looks like Katya doing a Trixie impression!
“the mics aren’t ready”
I hope y'all are having a great day
Love that James Charles palette she is using
He looks like Sherry Vine in the end! Great video
Tyler looking more like Davey Wavey everyday
why does Tyler looks low key like Bianca ? :D he has that eyes !!!!!!!
He looks more like Bianca than trixie
We love that James Charles X Morphe Pallet
Had to pause so many times due to laughing,but the most was because of "Oops, got you in the eye, sorry" which was funniest for the most inappropriate reasons.
Tyler is a daddy nowww
You remind me a little of Peter Parker at first
what a phuccen sTaR
Wow his arms got bigger!!
Monet Exchange was great.  Trixie is a bit different in terms of drag style, but it is definitely fun vibes all around still.  This was a treat, Tyler.
I Loved your book Ty 😘😘
when did Tyler get jacked
tempest, is that you???!!
Peep that Morphe X James Charles Palette 😏
The video we deserve
Again when did Tyler get beefed up .... daddy?
Damn Tyler you looook good
Liked this video the moment I seen it
Hoooooooooney !!!! Love love love 
Katya has to see this !
Is Nakita Dragun a drag makeup person or no
"Oh you just had to make the dress? You didn't have to dance in it and talk about your dead mom?"
I'm not sure there's a character in Rocky Horror named Trixie...
Tempest in trixies makeup

How long does it take to take off drag makeup?  Because it takes forever to take off my normal ass makeup, so its just gotta be at least an hour long ordeal, all the exfoliants! O.O
God I love Trixie
TYLER YOU SPOILED US WITH THIS VIDEO OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Why does Tyler look like Katya with trixie's makeup

You can tell at 12:07 Trixie is using the James Charles palette
I reminds me of one look of Christina Aguilera... Am I the only one?
How hot is Tyler, though.
i got katya and bianca vibes 😂😂😂
Tyler looks so adorable in this look!
I'm from Wisconsin too
This is my def my fav trixie collab, some ppl just don’t know how to interact w trixie and it’s awkward. But this was great and gave trixie a fun for her money lol, SO good!!
Don't drag Dollywood LOL.

Trixie low-key interested in Real Estate because she just bought a house and probably was v inspired by the agents showing her places. They thought they were doing sumn, overselling the backyard gazebo that comes with the house, but she's standing there in her head like, "I could do your job".
God Tyler is so hot

Uhhh this is what Trixie wore on pit stop for episode for which was way after this. Does that mean that she watches the episodes early and films early.
Trixie was rooting for Farrah, poor girl..

WISCONSIN PRIDE

Skipper Klaus

Love you Tracy !
oh honeEeEeY
fucking hottie!!
is that a human
This came in my recommendeds and dayummm
7:26 that James Charles x Morphe palette though
monet is shaking in the distance
tf did i just watch
you look so hot without your glasses!!!!
yes honeyyyy
Idgaf they look related
Why is nobody talking about that invitation to go upstairs and take a bath??? Whyyyyy????

Oh, honeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
WTF!! 👀👉👈👐👍
Dad?

Dad bod who???
Such purty qweens
That music was just not it
You look very interesting without your glasses. Your face almost looks naked!
Tracy!!!!!
RuPaul's scares the crap out of Me to
Peeps James Charles pallet at 7:23
They work very well together! I think Trixie's comedy shines when the person she's working with isn't TOO nice to her, honestly -- the banter is great. I would argue that Trixie, whether willingly or unwillingly, has in a way left children behind on this planet when she croaks in the next 24 hours. It was probably achieved through whatever infection she's spread to the also largely-childless lesbian population in her audiences that turned them into smaller, gayer versions of herself. I also caught Tyler's "HON-nay" for the Forrest Gump line, perfect.
The pink one is so terrify
Tyler you're  now Trixie Tyler
BUFF
We stan
The pink one so terrify
um I feel uncomfortable. .-.
This is just not normal. She/He or what is it, looks like clown, not like normal person
It’s like a mash up of Bianca del Río & Trixie, I’m living
Why do people care so much about Tyler’s body and not the video itself? Are you really fans?
Hella thick eyelashes
Channel is dying
I'm back here again and how does it not have 92838291836 million views
Idk how i got here but all I remember is that it all started when I Googled 'gays in the snow' and everything between then and now is in  a haze
The pink one so terrify
All the white ones. 😉
I haven’t been on Tyler’s YouTube in years, just because I lost touch, but when did Tyler grow up? Jesus? Muscles and all.
Since when did he get ripped
Ohh honey this light is homophobic
😍😍😍😍😍
Ohhhh HOOONEYYYYYY
The pink one terrify
amazing
Tyler is hot. That body gets views haha
“you just had to make a dress? you didn’t have to dance in it and talk about your dead mum” I SCREAMED
She looks like Katya
lol the leaf blowers face
Snow much fun!!!! ♥️💚💚♥️♥️💚
“Corn!”
Not even Trixie can revive your dead channel stereotypical gay youtuber...I mean...Tyler
Looks like trixie and bianca had a baby..
I’m obsessed with Trixies outfits. And I’m thrilled about this vid, can’t waaaaaait!
Looking baaad.

She looks like a pink bird and i love it!
LOVE LOVE LOVE
Tranny seduces ripped muscle daddy

Mini mattel
Mini Katya
Гей гейский
Love
Cute
Jasmine Master’s iconic Christmas look is shaking
The pink one so terrify
Tyler realized that being a fem bottom is dime a dozen and the only actual survival method for a gay guy is to try look masculine. Too bad about his flamboyant personality
JAMES CHARLES PALETTE HELLO?!?!
Is Trixie using the James Charles pallet. Like if you agree
Who'd Trixie owe a favor to have to sink to this level and deal with Tyler
Looks like you are a raccoon gone wrong.

Shout me out on your live ❤️❤️
Shout me out my user name is loving_troybix I love you iam a fan since 2014 just got your book binge
When he broke it down y’all were NOT ready
Feeling personally attacked by your guns in this video Tyler.
Them arms, I can’t!
This is the content I signed up for
Tyler went from twink to twunk and I'm here for it
This video is the definiton of "Why are all the cute ones gay?"
me sending this to all my lgbt+ friends is gay culture
“My hole is out” I DIED
I'm smiling throughout the whole video, this is such a treat 😂💕
What a time to be alive
‘Do I hump forward’ 😂😂😂
Tyler's glow up really has me feeling some type of way 🥰
1:23 the way Tyler runs off and says "byeee" is an everyday mood 😂❤️
This video is just wholesome 💞💞💞
The dancing is a complete flop but the outfits are cute tho
Gay culture is already knowing the dance 😭
the outfits take the cake for me
That's so gay, I love it
when did Tyler become so buff? wtf
You guys dance like Regina's mom
this is the gayest video i've ever seen and i love it
Tyler “Muscle Twink” Oakley
I have several things to talk about. 1. Nick killed it and looks gorgeous in a wig. 2. Austin is literally your twin without glasses. 3. Never been more excited for a video. 4. Great content!
my favourites!!!! happy holidays, i love y’all x
My face hurts from smiling and laughing. I love this!
Nick is a winner baby
Happy Holidays Ty! Austin was trying his damn best bless her
Can we get a drag version of this?
I pick Austin, I don’t care how he dances...😜😏
Nick won but by a narrow margin over Tyler (or under Tyler, however y'all boys like it). Austin definitely got Miss Congeniality
Nailed it! So fun to watch you struggle :D I would struggle even harder. I just CAN'T DANCE!
Tyler won yassssss 😘
Great funny video! Tyler you rocked it! insta-- julian_nels
4:12 when you’re walking on the beach barefoot and the sand is too hot
This is everything I need. Also TYLER! YOUR ARMS!! My lort. Dayyymn when that beat dropped. Tyler's 'bye' prancing away needs to be gifed and I need it immediately. Yall did great, props to Austin for trying his damn hardest. It was close between Nick and Tyler but I do think Tyler did slightly better.
I’d like to see y’all do this in full on drag
When did Tyler get hunky?? 😮
why was i half expecting dan and phil
Omg I am dying!! 😂💃🏽💜
if you know me you KNOWWW I am such a stan of Jamie literally want to dance with him the most
I thought the guy on the thumbnail behind Tyler was Ricky Dillon 😅😅😅
damn ur arms are poppin
This is great!!😱😂
reads “gays attempt”
me: oh no
This actually made my day... so hilarious!! Can we start a petition for Dan and Phil to do this tho😂❤
Tyler definitely won... both the dance and my heart 😍
Hiiii I love you
tylers body is so buff and beautiful omg
the talent jumped out
omg this was by far one of my favourite things to watch. you’re so iconic and i inspired to be like you
LOVE YOU SO MUCH TYKER I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU💞💞💞
im correcting myself: tyler you did AMAZING sweetie
OMG! I don't care if Austin can't dance to save his life, he won that!! His prize: he gets to sit on my face. 😍
Jamie isn't a regular teacher. He's a cool teacher! 😂
what a bunch of hunky bottoms
Happy holidays, Tyler! Really laughing with this video. 😍😍😘💃💃🕺🕺💕❤
You ladies tore it up
LMAO
#thejockettes
my insta is rubyshepp05 and im watching your live and ilysmmmmm
This was the content I needed after a shitty week. Thanks Tyler!
This was funnn! Your friends are great. ☺️
omg I LOVE YOU and I just support you so so so much in all of your decisions. And you, being so open about your sexuality, has also really helped me. (FYI, I am bi and IN the closet). But now I feel like, there's litterally nothing to be afraid of! So thank you for that. Btw SUPER funny video, you guys slaaayyy
much love to you <3
i mean tyler obviously won
lookin like a hotter tina fey in that wig too
I legit paused the video a second in so I could drool over Tyler’s arms😍😍🤤💪🏻
You are one of my most favorite YouTubers
Hi Tyler your so cool! I love your channel!
"This is hard, I need Tina Fey on the piano"..... so much truth in that statement.
much better than the original
austin's thighs are giving me life
Dancing with Tyler Oakley: Coming to theatres/cinemas January 2019 👏🏻😆
Perfect for the holidays!
Tyler, you know I love you but Regina Jamie George is SLAAAAAAYIN!  💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
collective gay screaming
But can you fly a plane 🤔
All I saw was FLEX 💪 And some thigh slapping 👀
Tyler won, but Austin was really cute being a Karen 😂😂
The content I never knew I NEEDED 😂🤞💝
Just come from the insta live!! Can’t wait to watch it!🎉🎄
Y'all are so cool! Love you ❤️

Me before watching: “oh no.” 

Me after watching: XDXD

Omg this is iconic
nick won definitely and Tyler you are second place. I won’t even say anything about austin hahahahahah at least he had fun
JAMMMIIIIEEEEEEEEE
Hahahahaha this is hilarious
Love ya so mutch!!
What's better than a Christmas video? 




A gay Christmas video!!!
Nick: ok now swing ur hips
Tyler: unhinges core and thrusts soul into a circle like a freshman at their first college party
Tyler won jingle bell rock and mean girls version ❤️🎄
When you watch a lot of dance reality tv and know what studio they’re at 😂
Austin is so thicc and pretty
Yes Tyler. Get it with that high school theatre club kick ball change!
My father passed last Christmas and your making this one better
OMG OMG OMG THIS IS AMAZING IM SCREAMING!! ❤️

Omg Austin was so much fun to watch. I agree that Tyler won. Too funny!
1:06 is absolutely iconic
this video is just what we deserve....
thanks Tyler .... you and the gays are THE BEST !!
So excited!!!! Hi Tyler Oakley!
When I saw the thumbnail I thought it was The Try Guys lol
HAHAHAHHAA i love you all😍😍🔥
Came here from the live @janraydulatre
maybe ariana should've asked you guys to be in the "thank u, next" video
Hahahaha so fun watching this video 😆😆😆
i’m rewatching this and your arms are making me confused about my sexuality-
Best. Holiday. Vid. EVERRR!you ALL WON!!! K tho Ty killed it, rite? BUT I LUV ALL OF U. Actually can’t believe those dingdong girls got that Cario together however they were given 3 months versus you’ll probably only had 2 hours
Omg I vote for Austin! He may not catch onto dance moves quickly, but he would of got it with more practice and he is adorable. I want to bake him a cake. He just seems like the kind of guy that radiates sunshine and it'd be impossible to be sad around him. I BELIEVE IN YOU AUSTIN! Must find his insta!
This makes me wish Damian danced with the girls in the movie
Love love love you tyler💖💖
This video really outgayed itself
the purest gays to ever gay <3
tyler 😰 the arms whewwwe
Them ham hocks in the pink shorts yes ma'am

Jamie was going o teach me how to dance last time I was in LA and make a video. I know i would of ended up like Austin haha 😆
The muscular gays have returned
Omg they look so sexy!!! ❤️❤️ Love y’all!!!
Your dance coach killed it with his freestyle performance! Now  that's what I call a merry Christmas!
Also your reactions in the background to him dancing are everything 😂
Oh MY GAWD REGINA GEORGE is QUAKING 👏👏
Tyler looks good as a brunette
This was honestly the motivation I needed to go to the gym, so I can break it down like Jaime 😂😂 thanks boys!
Austin’s short shorts give me life 🤤🍑

Austin is adorable 😻😇

Damn Tyler! When did you get so buff? You're looking hella sexy my friend! 💪😍

This was perfect from start to finish
this is everything.
Your so cool was watching on instagram live
I'm pretty sure I comment this on every single video but omg Tyler. You are looking so amazing. Those GUNS are the only ones I don't want to reform
This reminds me of when in theatre arts class, we went down to the dance class to learn a dance.
Definitely one of my first gay moments xD. Cause I was lovin’ it and KILLIN’ it!
The dance was kinda like the joke part of the demo at the beginning.
YES! I love seeing you going out and having the time of your life!
Mr boyblu! Love him, he is a amazing dancer. Saw him live in Amsterdam when he toured with Todrick
Austin your were amazing sweetie!
When you start watching Tyler again after 4 or 5 years and he is forking ripped.
Man you got some moves ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The dance was hilarious. Why are Tyler’s friends so foine tho?! Like Austin was struggling to dance while I was struggling to BREATHE
This is phenomenal good job
Normally I try not to thirst I  the comments but Austin is definitely my winner. Please ruin my life Austin
Tyler love ur vids

It resulted in many stares.

Tyler's step-ball-changes were on it! It looked like everyone had fun, that's the important part :)
I just realized how jacked Tyler actually is, and it's making me uncomfortable. My whole reality has been flipped on its head.
Austin DEFINITELY won
Nick! But Tyler killed it too ❤️

The gay agenda :

So this is what a dying channel looks like..
Love the sass when you dance Tyler 😂😍
I say Tyler Won
Austin had the best performance face, with that joyous smile even through the parts he was like "I don't fully know this move but I'm having a great time", which is very Karen and I LOVE it. Great job, everyone!
