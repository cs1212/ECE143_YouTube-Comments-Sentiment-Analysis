Season finale = binge watch your previous seasons
Can't believe Zaxby's and Chik fil A weren't in the line up
Before you guys get blindfolded, you guys should say which one is your favorite then afterwards see which one you guys actually like
Why isn’t Chick-Fil-A a conTENDER?
Chick Fil A: Am I a joke to you?
Has anyone ever noticed how good Link is at guessing what's coming up in the next round?
Link has a distinct talent for guessing the next brand
No one:


Link every time he eats something on the show: wE'rE LiViNg tHe LiFe MaN
Link: “I’m not lovin it~” while eating mcdonalds💀💀
Wow 15 seasons. I still remember link first talking about his OCD. Congratulations guys and keep up the awesome work.
GOOD MYTHICAL MORNING
chicken fingers are nice but it is a good dipping sauce that makes them great.
rhett, i respect ya, i find ya funny, well i god damn like ya bud. Bur NEVER say "rep ya boiz" again
Guess I’ll have to try Carl’s Jr. or as we call it down here in this gulch, Hardee’s!!!
wait FINALE?!?!?!?! this season seems like it just started last week :(
Ima just say Cane's is amazing. By far the best.
"this tastes honest. like it wasn't processed"

rates a 4.

I see you
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO WILL IT UMBRELLA (if that’s okay)
Rhett:WE GOT THE SEASONS IN THE BAG-
Me:I GoT tHE HoRsEs iN ThE BaCk
What if one of the crew members replaced the water in their mugs with something else? I think that would be hilarious.
I only have 5 fingers 
10 in total



They have 6 fingers 
12 in total

How is this fair
"as you can see, we cant!"

WHY ISNT THAT ON A SHIRT YET
WELCOME TO THE SEASON 15 FINALE 
Guys you can clap
(crew claps)
As my friend said, "You gon' get loved tenderly" hahah
Link: Carl’s Jr.? 
Next one: Carl’s Jr. 
link: Popeyes?
Next one: Popeyes.
Link: McDonals? 
Next one: McDonald’s...
They really played link there. 😂
HOW IS DAIRY QUEEN NOT INCLUDED IN THESE TESTS?!
R&L two years ago: I only got 2 right!?!? Imma frickin looooserrrr!!!

R&L today: 2’s pretty good man.
Will it Raman noodle?! Have mythical chef josh make powers to mix in with plain Raman noodles!
I wish Golden Chick was more readily available.  It's amaaaazing.
Yess Good Mythical summer coming on my birthday, June 3rd!!
Smh I cant believe Rhett gave up on the chance to say winner winner chicken dinner
Link: I didn’t taste eleven herbs... 
Rhett: I thought I tasted at least 10. 
😂
ive been here since Links vest phase
and the bird poop jokes c:
Rhett Wins
Link Loses
Rhett Has to sing in a raw chicken mask
Link chills there eating some chicken tenders
8:32 “I’m not loving this chicken tender”  the irony 😂
I love the fact that every episode they mention another place from Raleigh NC, I loved Pullen Park as a kid 🤗
'As you can see, we cant' has got to be one of my favorite lines from them
1:42 Rhett's face had me literally choke on my water
Wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, WhOa, WHOA!  

Chicken fingers are NOT the same as chicken tenders.
So why will there be no LTAT during summer???? I do not doubt that Josh will have great videos but I'm too much a fan of LTAT. Until next LTAT keep BYMB .....
breakfast without you won't taste half as good, have a great vacation and come back soon
I LIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA


ILL SHIP YOU BOJANGLES!!!
A&W Chicken tenders are the BEST. Hands down. And they didnt even get featured in this video 😥😥
You should guess where that Mac ‘n cheese is from
you should invite Ricky from Trailer Park Boys for this episode tbh
No Bojangles.  That's a paddlin'.
Thanks Rhett. Now I have to pause the video and go listen to Barenaked Ladies.
Can you make a playlist of all the "game" intros? They are great. 🙂
I will say Carl's Jr. Chicken tendies are slept on for sure
As you can see, we can’t.
Dairy queen?
I just copped that 3pc for $7 wit fries, a drink and a sundae, my boy!


(And the dq tendies are better then popeyes, dont @ me)
What Friday came so fast. Miss you guys catch you in 2 weeks.
Chicken strips bro!!! If you say chicken fingers you are not form this planet 😂
A bunch of rookie scores. Pres would not be impressed.
i got the season in the bag
Roy Rogers has the BEST chicken strips. PERIOD
PLEASE HAVE A VIDEO OF CHEF JOSH TEACHING US HOW TO COOK. I'm hopeless ..
I love how they guessed the Mc Donald’s one and said “ I’m not loving it” 😭
Never disrespect the Carl's Jr's Chicken Fingers
I just noticed, is that john myungs bongo bass in the back?
Welp, time to go to Hardee's because apparently they have amazing tendies that I've never tried.
where’s chick-fil-a
"Why is this a prize?!?!"


Absolutely dying here.
When Rhett said: It's the season finale, I literally SCREAMED NO!!!!!!! 'Till my apartment neighbor kicked my door.
"im not lovin' it, maybe its mcdonalds" - the most intelligent thing ive heard them say - SMART!
Can u guys do a pickle one??
@2:32 Shoutout to NC 🤘🏻& our favorite in state restaurant chain, Smithfields Chicken & BBQ 😍
Popeyes and church's boi
Link...




LOVES THAT CHICKEN FROM POPEYES
You need the amazing sauce from Raising Canes to completely enjoy their chicken
I Work at Carols Jr and they probably have  one of the best chicken tenders
8:50 When did Link start listening to City Girls
the only thing good about canes is the bread 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Bojangles' Supremes are bomb!!!
Can't wait for some Mythical Chef Josh videos!
Canes is gross. It's super plain.
Popeyes FTW
they will be back june 3rd.
yo thats my birthday
Chickens don't have fingers.
June 3rd is my birthday, thank you♥️😭
No Zaxbys? No Chick-Fil-a?  😣
HAHAHAA  the eyebrows and glasses on the blind folds. Heheheeeese
rhett really missed the opportunity to say winner winner chicken dinner
Popeyes 
That could do some damage 😂
You can like use that on the tip of a spear 😭😭😭🤦🏿‍♂️
Link is so strange...just all-around 😂💀 Hahahaha literally just all-around haha
I'm disappointed that Zaxby's wasn't here today.
Prize part only time I laughed. Thanks though 😉
Church's chicken has the best fried chicken dont @ me
Rhett: welcome to the season 15 finale!
Crew: cheers 
Me: cry's why just why ohh nooo i cant wait
Rhett says: I feel like it needs honey mustard. Yes definitely honey mustard.
Thanks GMM, for making my weekday mornings both Good, and Mythical for 15 seasons!
They brought you bad Cane's, cause Raising Cane's is so good
Everyone in my school just thinks canes is the best, and Id have to agree! lol
They changed ALOT well dang
Y'all are from North Carolina WHERE is zaxbys
I’ve always wondered if the food is cold or still warm ? 🤣
Raisin Cane's is kinda bland without the sauce.
No Chick-fil-a!?
I binge watch the food episodes while fasting 


#Ramadanlogic
Asheville in da house!!
Lets get rippin into some drive thru chicken I think is my new favorite phrase!!!
Thank you for all the laughs!
If Danny from Game Grumps sees this he’s going to be so jealous
Raisin Canes with their sauce and sweet tea tho :O
I'm shocked they said Carl's Jr tasted great, we recently got them in Saskatchewan (Canada) and they were awful, got my father sick twice and the nuggets were rubber.
mythical beasts trying to watch gmm on monday

as you can see... you can't 😭
If there is no Chik Fil A, is it really a chicken contest?
How have I never seen a churches near pullun park
Canes being not fresh and no sauce and texas toast completely invalidates this opinion
Now I feel like I gotta try this Carl's Jr chicken tender.
Yaaay another season in the bag lol
Best youtubers
I'm excited for the new Saturday episodes. I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion but I'm not a big fan of LTAT, so some new content will be refreshing for Saturdays.
Do pizza next if it hasnt been done yet
Chicken fingers and tenders are confused during the episode
Keith dies
ah June 3rd,six days before my birthday.. Perfect!!
Never clicked so quickly... Love your vids 🙃
Everyone whose had raising canes knows. You need the sauce with it 💯
Eating Chicken Fingers for 12 Minutes = 900k Views + Trending
the "im not lovin it" was such great timing lmao🤣
Why no sonic in there
Now this is what I'm talking about.
I LOVE CHICKEN FINGERS.
Gonna miss you guys. Enjoy your mini-vacation.
Even though I'm sure you'll stay busy still. Much love.
"This is not a prize...why is this a prize?"😂
That Church's by Pullen Park is the only one I'll go to
for me the sauce makes the chicken taste superb!😋😉😍
i was watching for over 4 years to see some bull testicles in smoothies not chicken tender review
Finally, an episode where I'm jealous of what you guys are eating lol chicken tenders are my favourite food. I don't care what fast food place I go to, they're always what I order 😁 My favourite ones that I've ever had though are Zaxby's which I think is only in the southern states
CHICKEN *TENDERS*! Not fingers. As in chicken appendages! They're chicken tenders. 😂😂😂
Aye glad to see Asheville!!! Gotta love is
Let Ricky (trailer park boys)  DO THE JUDGING.
I’m a simple man. I see GMM and chicken fingers, I click!
I agree with Rhett! How is that chicken feet mask a prize?!
blind taste test sides of toast from fast food places
They should do a signature sauce challenge!!!
I still remember the OCD song..
Me: Hey what’s ur job?




Gmm crew: We feed our bosses chicken tenders....
Wow, no Chick-Fil-a........ I'm shooooketh
You’ll be back June 3rd? That’s my birthday. Guess it’s a birthday present from Rhett and link
SAD BUT EXCITED FOR THE NEXT SEASON
Episode over aging. Link seems to be aging much faster than Rhett. Hairdos tho
I have never ever seen Rhett make that face before 1:45 lol
Woah! I was eating Rocky’s Hot Chicken while watching this episode!
Rhett give u props I’m in Georgia and churches chicken is on point
DAIRY QUEEN! Their fingers are sooo underrated!
I love Rocky’s hot chicken shack in Asheville North Carolina. It is so good.
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!
Speaking of Chicken, I would love to see Guy Fieri as a guest 🙈 I'm sure it's been considered in the past lol
welp they said finge rthe chicken A L O T
LOL A Raw Chicken Mask??!!
Dairy Queen has the best chicken tenders.
Raisin Caines needs their sauce
’Tis the Season 15 Finale, best of luck mythical beasts as we try to survive the hiatus, but see y’all back in June for GMS!

Until then remember to always bymb 🔥
“Tenderize us” Rhett 2019
Finally, some good content on YouTube
Eating some Dairy Queen chicken strips while watching this.
I looove chicken tenders. My mouth is literally watering.
Can't eat Canes tenders without Cane's sauce smh
YEAH they will be back for my B-Day
I thought Link liked a crunch on top of his weehaw
Who's fasting lol?
Lol, that prize at the end! I'm in giggles!

Least you didn't have to endure Sonics shudders
Please do more Mini Mythical Morning!!!!!
Love my chicken tenders with plenty of BBQ, or honey mustard.
Putting Cane's that low is blasphemous.
Yard Birds has the best chicken.
I swear these rhett and link would perfectly cosplay Rhys and Vaughn From tales from the borderlands.
Rhett's singing in the intro was actually fire
I can‘t wait to see Videos with Josh, he‘s such a humble guy.
Bojangles references always get an A+.  Thank you for staying true to your NC roots, Link.
YOOO JUNE 3RD IS MY BIRTHDAYYY LET'S GOOO
Well.. I may be upset that this is the season finale, but at least S15 ended with some delicious chicken strips! :)
BEST GAME JINGLE SO FAR!!
Pullen Park!!! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
The best one is the supremes at bojangles. Duh
Man, you are the best! Since I subscribed, #GMM family is here!
Can’t wait till June 3rd to see new intro
No chick-fa-la? K then
I swear if Gmm ever split up like how WassabiProductions and Smosh did. I'd cry and delete YouTube forever 😭
Cane's is all about the sauce.
Should have got Dan Avidan for this ep, he would have loved it

Congrats on wrapping another season!
"Nate, how are those chicken strips?"
the quips in this vid are legit fire
Tastes McDonald's
"I'm not loving it"
I’ve been waiting my entire life for this moment.
No one:
Rhett: iT's ToO sAwTy
No Bojangles? You say you're from North Carolina but you never show BOJANGLES
Zaxbys has the best chicken fingers hands down 😤
Do onion rings or milkshakes next!
Not even 2 mins in and Link accidentally says an innuendo 🤣🤣
Missed opportunity for a fully Minecraft episode
i feel like in order to properly rate Canes you need to put that crack sauce on the tendy.
basically proved Cane's is only good with sauce
Yesss I’ve missed the blindfold challenges!!
What am I'm going to do till June 3rd 😭😭😭😭😭😭
i never clicked faster
No Chick-fil-A?!?!?! Blasphemy
THEY FINALLY APPRECIATED CANES!!!
Rocky's Hot Chicken Shack in Asheville is like 20 min from where i live
Love you guys! Love from Ohio! Happy 15th Finale!!! 🎉💓🎂🥳
Links guesses for round 2,3,4 were 1 round early😂😂
No Zaxby’s? You guys are from the south come on! Best there is!
Link still puts his cup on the end of the table after aLL THESE YEARS IT GIVES ME ANXIETY
When I tried the McDonald’s tender it was burnt too 😩 has anybody tried Dairy Queen’s it’s really good! Especially with the gravy sauce*
Ayyyy season 15 done. Good job guys! And congrats to every member of your crew!
wth r chicken fingers. im not joking WTH is it
enjoy your break i will miss u dearly
I need sauce with my tenders!
serves McDonald's chicken



Link: " almost like a burnt taste"
I love how Link lost but got the real prize and Rhett won but his prize was a definite 0.
carls jr is my favorite too
Aw...no chicken express?
Church's chicken always gone be around because they stay getting  a average of 7 mostly
Rhett was thinking: "Glad I lost"
We'll miss you! I hope you have a relaxing break!!!
*Raising Cane
*Chick fill A
Raising canes is a 10!!
Looking forward to Josh this summer
Personally, I like Red Robin the best, their seasoning makes chicken tenders and steak fries like drugs
Finally!!! These blindfolded tests are back..even though it's for the finale 😂
Anyone else make the "Lovin It" joke before Link??
Chicken tendies need ranch+bbq sauce.  Mix this, trust me, if you haven't, you have never eaten tendies and fries right.
CANES HAS THE BEST CHICKEN CHANGE MY MIND
Anyone else eat chicken fingers with honey dill 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Who else is sooooo jealous 😢🤤🤤🤤
Did you forget bojangles?
KFC's chicken strips are the most delicious when they're dipped in KFC'S honey mustard. That stuff is so good.
My chicken tender is not bent 😎
Y'all may want to wash their eye masks so that they are not at risk from infection from them.
Blind chickens watching: am I a joke to you?
Whatburger chicken strips are the best.
Little Debbie Snacks Taste Test!!
4:05 don’t tell Churches you said that.
My favorite Foo Fighters song
The PreTender
I love LTAT so I hope it sticks around. I'm also looking forward to Josh, though.
JUNE THIRD IS MY BIRTHDAY OMFGGG HBHVGCGV SKSKSK
Winner Winner CHICKEN Dinner
Canes is so good 🤠🤧
Blind Taste test the best sauce from fast food
Hello Rhett and link I love you
draws glasses on his blindfold
Y'all need the SAUCE!!!
big fan of the one week reference in the beginning
You: What part of the chicken are tenders made from?

Me: Chicken tenders are made from the taint of a chicken. It's the most tender part of the body.
In grade 6 my friend and I made a company called KFP






REVENGE OF THE CHICKENS
As someone with a chicken tender leaderboard, I approve of this taste test.
link keeps choosing the ones that are up next 😂
Ya'll really disrespected Cane's like that. Also, I'm sad you guys probably don't have access to Zaxby's or Goldfingers. Those are the best places to get chicken besides Cane's imo
I was offended when they didn’t say CHICKFILLAAAAAA AHHHHHH 🐥
Canes is amazing. Your taste buds must be going bad in your old age
when they clapped, i cried:(
avengers endgame post credit scene avengers endgame post credit scene @T1Nw
Why didn’t you include Arby’s? They are the best.
POPEYES has the best tenders ever 💯💯💯. Too bad the customer service is not as incredible lol
Really? No, "winner, winner chicken dinner"?
Best chicken tendies are from Safeway. I am prepared to fight
So we just gonna ignore they ate chicken fingers with no sauce
the ones from Hardee's are tasty
Canes is by far the best.
By far the taste test i would most want to be a part of! 👍
but mcdonalds is my favorite kind D:
Do they not wash the face masks? lol
Canes if the best😂
I thought they were going to eat real chicken fingers 🙁
Chick-fil-A too obvious?
Sorry about Bojangles (I say as I eat a Cajun filet biscuit).
Link: *macdonalds jingle
Everyone: NANI
the prophecy us true
you gotta eat canes when its fresh, 10x better
I see chicken tenders more as a delivery system for a variety of sauces.
I'm glad he acknowledged Bojangles.... But where was CHIC-FIL-A??!
Believe it or not, Arby's has the best chicken fingers
Wendy's chicken fingers are pretty damn good.
I stan Raising Cane's  !
Zaxbys, raising Cane's & chic fil a Top 3 no specific order
You forgot Canes this test is incomplete
Eating chicken rn
I just discovered Hardee’s/Carl’s jr  chicken tenders a couple weeks ago they are amazing. My dad said they use to have bomb chicken too.
You guys should do a blind taste test on root beer!
Cane's is da best
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner
WHy iN alL of tHe EarTH Do TheY NoT HAVe CHicK-fL-A???
Carl's jr chicken tenders are really good
Man, Link has some nice teeth
Anyone else miss the Frankenstein-Round?
June 3rd? That’s my birthday!!
State Nukies VOl.2 Only Florida
I obviously need some Carl’s now
Rhett, what you warned me about happenned. I stopped. clicking. on your face! 



But im back, baby






I only clicked for the fried chicken 😏
Yesss! The blind taste tests are back!
1:40 look at Rhett's face when link says something questionable😭😂
Chick-fi-A would beat them all hands down!
Damn this is some quality content
why does link always think kfc only makes original recipe
Churches chicken OMG
This video is incomplete without Chick-fil-A
Did anyone else immediately go to Hardee’s (Carl’s Jr) after watching this video to pick up some chicken tenders? 😂
WHERE THE HECK WAS CHICK-FIL-A????????
I am enjoying this program since maybe 5 or 6 years and I love you guys  💖💖
Chik fil a above all
Raising, and zaxbys are better than all of these
Is anybody else wondering where chick-fil-a is
Im a first time watcher, and there accents are amazing
You guys are the best and I love chicken.
I conveniently had Bojangles tenders for lunch today and yes they were amazing!
Wendy’s chicken fingers 👌👌👌👌
Y'all need to actually GO to Raising Cains!! It's the BEST chicken I've ever had in my life.... but with the combination of Cane's Sauce....
HEY ROCKYS HOT CHICKEN SHACK GAVE ME FOOD POISONING
Link's jacket is nice
You should have gone to chick fil a
How was Chick-fil-A not included? My other favorite is Culvers, but they are more regional.
I'm from the origin state of Raising Cane's (Louisiana) and I am offended.
I cant believe they gave Carl's JR tenders a 9.  Popeye's all the way.
Chicken tenders come straight from the chicken, the only processing that should be involved is shipping and preservation which most chicken places do solely through refrigeration.
#12 on trending street
You should tru chicken express that place is the best
Weird to think that if gmm was a regular show, it would've ended like 6 seasons ago.
Link was predicting the next round instead of guessing the one he was on
I have learned by this video that they prefer grease. They just enjoy the taste of grease, not chicken lol
Where is Chic Fil-a ????
Are they tasting fingers or tenders? There is a difference.
this is frick- tHis is nOt a pRize???
You missed Dairy Queen! They have dope fingers
You missed Dairy Queen! They have dope fingers
That is not no CHICKEN MAN




like if you get the reference..
You guys forgot about chick-fil-a
Hardees does have the best tenders
It's still suprising to me that I've been watching GMM since 4th grade and now I'm about to graduate 8th 💞❣️😭
that has got to be one of the coolest and disgusting masks that the 
crew has ever made on the show!!  LOL.
Ok but like Minecraft , gmm, and John wick 3 all in one day.
people aare saying there going to binge watch the rest of there vids but i genuinely think ive watched every vid... feels bad
“Burnt period”
Link’s 2-4 choices were all 1 round early if you guys realise that 🤨😂
raising canes is the best chicken in the line up.... failed
Rhett saying I need some more for every single one is so funny!
The guys both look real cute today! 😍
What? No Chick-fil-A? Was this done on a Sunday?
What? No chic filet?
its crazy this season is over
Can I be the one that says it is time to spin the wheel of mythicality
You forgot the best one. Chick-fil-A
The bearded fella looks just like a guy I used to ride around Hawaii with on mountain bikes 30 years ago... his dad was a Pioneer in matching bullets to rifles in Texas.
Was that song Hawaiian rollercoaster ride from lelo and stich
Who else wants to try Carl's jrs chicken tenders now lol
I joined the mythical society!2nd Degree
Personally, I think all the chicken fingers are great.... IT'S THE SAUCE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE

(Cough) Zaxby's (Cough)
Cane's is the best in my opinion
The best chicken fingers is charley biggs, they're at some gas stations near me in Ohio
Before I watch this..."LETS GO CHURCHS CHICKEN !!! WOO"
You should put chick fil a also
Dude......... I feel like GM summer was just a month ago!!!! Time flies
Popeye's spicy tenders are the best
Gmm do will it: Cheese Burger
I worked at a Hardee's/ Carl's junior a while back and thier chicken is made fresh.👌
Y’all should switch seats
Not sure if I like this whole “instead of LTAT” thing....
My vacation started the same day GMMs did
Golden chick beats them all
“This video is brought to you by Carls Jr.” lol
I am going to Carl’s Jr.
YOU TWO HAVE NEVERRRR BEENN TOO RASIN CANES ‼️‼️‼️‼️ go immediately
Can't beat popeye's spicy chicken tenders with the blackened ranch <3
Popeye's is the best and this can't change my mind.
Canes are the best !!
ماكو عرب😭😭
Wow june 3rd thats my birthday😀

Its also my mock exams😞
The fact that Canes aren't in this is a failure
who else misses the original intro theme
I paused at the right momen 4:31
Um no Chick-fil-A???
Best Chicken Fingers: Hardee's/Carl's Jr.
Best Sauce to dip Chicken Fingers in: Wendy's (Creamy Sriracha)
Is it a Canadian thing or do other people call them chicken "strips" instead of "fingers"? I'm curious.
Man I’ll miss you guys. Have a good break I can’t wait for season 16! Thanks for a great season
You didn't even do Chick-fil-A... :((
They need a break☺️
Raising Cane's is the best. You need that sauce though.
0:17 When you tell your audience to legit applause and be super excited. I love this show so much!
Who’s ready for season 16
Canes has the best chicken fingers ever. ❤️
chickens ain't got no fingers
When you realize it’s the season finale 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I’ll miss u good boys for two weeks
Carl's Jr chicken strips are the bomb!!
Hardee's/Carl's Jr used to have tenders drenched in Frank's Red Hot and they were amazing 😃
Burnt PERIODT
Chick-fil-a though?
Skip @ 10:56 for the scores.  yw
They should've added kikis. 100% best.
Dairy Queen chicken tenders are really good!!
5:42 He didn't just taste it.... he felt it......
How could you not have Chick-fil-A in this lineup?
JOSH CONTENT YESSSS
Haven't watched in a bit ig the wheel has been cut from these specific videos lol
total missed opportunity when rhett was singing that song, could have said "and im a chicken tender" to end it with lol 😂😂
No chik fil a or zaxbys...wtf
Raising Cane’s is all about the sauce! Their cane sauce is life changing
CHIK-FIL-A is better than all those!!
canes soaks their chicken in butter for 12 hours before frying
Canes a 4.5 NOT OKAY
I can't wait two weeks, lol what am I going to do with my mornings now?
Go to canes and eat the chicken strips with the sauce
Can I ask... what about chick fil a ???
No chik-fil-a??
Raising Canes is the best.
Sorry you missed the best one chic a filet
The fact y’all tied Cane’s with McDonald’s is blasphemy. Go to an actual Cane’s and you’ll be in fast food heaven
"That's an honest, gushy chicken."
No chic filet?
No Chik-Fil-A? Are you serious?! Disappointed.
Golden Chick has The Best Chicken
Link actually got it right when he said that he was 100% sure!!!! I'm so proud 😂
Now I want chicken tenders
i’m the winner
mcinator 
i smell like a sinner
“because i just ate chicken fingers”
or “because i just won at eating chicken fingers”
YOU HAD THE PERFECT CHANCE
June 3rd is my birthday
Where the Zaxby’s at? Truly the best chicken fingers.
Anyone remember good morning chia Lincoln? Good old days
Dude .. you don’t have whataburger , Caine’s or chicken express.  Your little test is invalid.
NO WAY THEY PLACED RAISING CANES THAT LOW CMON MANNNN
Wait, what?! McDonald's has chicken tenders?!
I’m vegan, why am i watching this😂
The man who doesn’t dip his chicken fingers in sauce is not alpha
You both lost - no Dairy Queen chicken fingers.
WOW NO ZAXBYS IM PISSED
Should've flown in some Zaxbys... disappointed in these mediocre choices
i thought the intro would be goldfinger by shirley bassey
I’m deeply saddened by finales but will remain vigilant
Was that a steins gate reference
YEAH!! Popeyes AND Cane's!!! Louisiana representin' the chicken
Zaxby's 😂😂
REEEEEEE give me tendies
It feels like a place that’s dedicated to chicken.
 
CARL’S JR. DELICIOUS CHARBROILED BURGERS. 😂
Have a little bite and your heart quits tickin !!!!!
these blind taste tests are the best thing about your channel. The more, the better
how do i apply for this
chicken tender bender oml
How can you not include Chickfila!
Cane's is a lot better with the sauce. Which I heard is only in texas. So i'm really glad I live in texas
"As you can see, we can't" needs to be on a shirt!
You NEED Caine’s sauce for Caine’s chicken.
link really said "period" lmfao
Lowkey disappointed that they didn’t include chick-fil-a
The churchs tenders arent supposed to be that crunchy
Vegans be like reeeeeeeee
What about Publix Chicken tenders
my kids call them carl nuggets. pretty good imo
Chicken tenders are good who agrees.
Raising Cane's wasn't included? Seriously?
Y'all need raising canes
You should both get acrylic nails done
Chicken tenders are good who agrees.
No frankestein today
My Birthday June 7th!
Rhett season 15 finale
Link claps
Me dies
I religiously go to Pullen Park every five years, thanks Link!
Chick-Fil-a is the best.
The mom with her 2 sons and the end did a good job😂😂😂😂
Canes is good for one reason: the sauce.
HMU snapchat:bjosh064
What about whataburger chikentinderz
A Tender was so crispy and crunchy (I'm not gonna say where it's from) that I chipped a tooth
Well, where's Los Pollos Hermanos?
Haha no way! I just had Raising Cane’s for the first time today! I will never eat any other chicken again... 🤤
Where's chick-fil-a?
You’re right, Link! Chicken tenders always makes for a good day. 🙂
I love the nod to the Barenaked Ladies!
It's not chicken fingers without Cane's
Link is guessing the places for the one after
Why not Publix or chick fila
Chicken tenders are the best things ever created
Dairy Queen has great chicken strips.
Fallen kingdom made me cry
Does anybody actually eat at Carl's Jr lol
U wanna talk Chicken Tenders? Come to College Station, Texas and try the chicken tenders at our exclusive, Wings N More restaurant
June 3rd is my b day!
I'm going to Carl's JR again now
Cane's is my favorite fast food restaurant. Period.
raising canes has the best chicken tenders
I really don't want this season to be over. Also ltat is my new favorite show. Also does the podcast stops too?
No ones talking about the extremely clever bare naked ladies intro....
No Chick Fil A?
Scotland's best invention
Wendy's Fast food chicken fingers is the best!
Where’s chick-fil-a
Very odd that Link was guessing the next one in line after the first one.
That's it I just ordered chicken tenders
can it chicken stip(crazy coats around the chicken) example cake covering a chicken tender.and more exotic food around chicken tenders
how is there no CFA here
a disgrace
Season finale 😢
Thanks Rhett, Link and Crew for a great 15th season. Have  a good few weeks Mythical Beasts. Binge watch away.
NO ZAXBYS!! What?
Butt chicken is the best
You didnt even put chick-fil-a in. But you put carls Jr. How does that make sense
burger king?
Eating Raising Canes without the sauce. What kind of sacrilege is this?
No body: 
Litterly no body: 
Rhett
6:10
Need Culver's chicken fingers, they are by far my favorite!
I like your green mugs but $16 for a mug DAMN!!!!!!
No Chick fil-A? Weak
Churches chicken? Never heard of that place lol
Raising canes is dry and that’s why they have a secret sauce that tastes so good
Now I want chicken fingers
Canes got a bad rap here—yours must have been sitting around for a while. Fresh and juicy, it beats all of the others hands down.
you have to put canes sauce on those tenders
Anyone remember when GMM used to be good?
Raising canes hands down.
Rocky's Chicken Shack is what I miss the most from my trip to NC. The Fried MacNCheese poppers are great and so is the chicken.
I bet they miss some Chic FIL a
Its STRIPS you uncultured swines
Now I want chicken tenders 😞
The best & real chicken fingers are from "KRISPY KRUNCHY CHICKEN" here in Metro Detroit ,idk if they are nation wide.....
The crunch of the chicken makes me want some really bad!
canes is definitely the best
Cant Wait for Josh's eps this summer!!!!
What about Chick Fil-A? Try to be a contender.
@yoursoloud
It's time to binge GM More for the next two weeks
RAISIN CANES FTW
where is Chick-fil-A?
Why am I watching two grown men eat chicken fingers? 😂
come on its Ramadan
Whsy about bo jangles
Popeyes all the way
where are they finding these fingers because the ones i get are small and thin asf
NEITHER OF YOU HAS EVER BEEN TO CANES??? ITS SUPER GOOD! The chicken needs the canes sauce to be good tho
Everyone forgets about Roy Roger.
Where was this 15 years ago when I was switching from nuggies to fingies
WOW IM FROM ASHEVILLE NC THATS SO FREAKING COOL WHAT THE HECKKKKK
That little laugh when he said u gotta go deeper lol
Chic Filet better than all this boo boo
Super excited for mythical chef Josh videos!
Yes that bojangles shoutout!
Raising canes a 4.... ohh you didn’t have that epic dipping sauce
I've never had a good tender from  Carl's Jr
Popeyes has their own breed of chicken.....
And yet another year arrived and goes
you need to go to canes! the canes sauce makes the chicken!
Raising Cane’s beats these all
Church’s spicy strips are good
Ever heard of Raising Cane's?
Does ANYONE remember Burger King having chicken strips, not those chicken "fries"?
wish they did PDQ instead of Hardees
Today's prize: Salmonella face!
KFC all the way❤️
JOSH EPISODES??? YAAAASS
Finally someone else that thinks canes is not that good
You should do something about birthday cake(my birthdays on june 5th so that’s why I thought of it)
>no popeyes
I wonder if they realize none of that iz REAL chicken🤣🤣🤢
Katt Williams tried to warn y'all but of course, people don't listen 🤷🏾‍♂️
TBH should be CHICKEN TENDERS
Dairy Queen has the best.
I want the McRib to come back and supersize size to come back !! 😡
No Zaxby’s really hurts my feelings... sorry California, but y’all don’t have the good chicken lol
THEY DID BARENAKED LADIES FOR THE GAME TITLE!
Where’s chick-fil-a?
The only one I even recognize is kfc
Where was the chic-fil-a ???
Omg!!!! Finale!!!! No!!!!
WATCHING from  PH
Popeyes won....period...I didn’t even watch the video yet but Popeyes is slap
Alright, alright, alright.
I wish Pioneer Chicken was still in California
6:39 lol
But how do they taste all together? 😋
No hearts chicken
I love how Link used the word Honest to describe half the chicken fingers ✌
Loveeee you guys.
Err body knows bojangles chicken supremes are the best
Carl's Jr is ok but Hardee's is superior
Hardees/Carl Jr. does make good chicken. I prefer Bojangles and Popeye's myself, but I will eat them all happily. Thanks for another great season.
Didn't have Bojangles!? WTF lost all credibility lol
video starts at 2:05 ur welcome
Links confidence in the blind guessing games is my favourite thing.
Canes is all about the sauce baby. Lol.
Who loves raising canes
The thing about canes is you need it with the sauce.  If it had the sauce they would have given canes the number one spot
Canes is only good w/ their sauce, very plain w/o it.
I love going to Pullen Park !!!!
Amazing job
No Chick-fil-A
GMM Season finales are the only thing that bring me an odd emotion of happiness and depression simultaneously.
No Chick-fil-a? Gonna have to redo this one boys.
Rasing canes is da fricken best
Maccas doesn't have chicken
I like how its the finals but they forgot steak n' shake chicken fingers which is the best!?!?!?!?!
Omg I got all 6 right!
but what ..... what is a chicken tender bender ??
No zaxbys major major L
Missing Zaxbys and Chick-fil-A
Raising canes is the best
The fact that I work at Popeyes is hilarious and that I only eat the tenders for my lunch break
CANES IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD
I love how the other guy just instantly goes let's talk about that
Ok what song was the intro based on
Your lack of Wendy’s disturbs me.
No Nandos!?!?
It seems so silly to do this test without Bojangles. I hope you’re spending some of that break back in NC!
Wait a min NC?
KFC is god
Can't wait for Mythical Summer!! 💕
Now that McDonald’s has fish and chips you guys should do one of these with fish and chips!!!
“As you can see, we can’t” is my favorite line.
those better not be dragon chicken fingers
Chick-fil-A not being on here deserves a dislike.
Church’s >>
Little bit of crunch on the top of ur hee haaa
Chick fil a wins, better than them all
10:20 they do if your rich enough
I looked up will it and was drinking a ice cream float so...why not do "Will it float?" It's a cool idea for summer and who doesn't love it! If you don't do it I'm ok you guys rock
“That’s a good piece of chicken”
😭😂
No chick-Fil-a or Canes whatttt
Carls jr is underrated
I've been watching you guys since the beginning but um, are you ever going to do anything that doesn't involve food again?
Wataburger and bush’s have the best
Popeyes > All
we have a canes about 3 hours from my house 😭 i wish to try it one day lol
Ima have to eat at Carls jr now
I only clicked on this video to say it's a crime to not include Cane's.
Raising canes 💚
Id nail this SO hard not even a hammer cld do as good as me
Burger King intensifies
"Ya this is honest, I'll take some more" 😂
Popeyes all the way for me
You are the best I like your channel I always watch because of you it’s the best for life
Trending?! Yassss
Should've tried Braums
Bojangles will always be king
I just went to Pullen Park the other day! Yay Raleigh. ❤️
I think I got a fender bender watching this chicken tender video
churches chicken is the best
Hey anons how we doing
No Chick Fil A!?
So phallic!
12:07 of mouth water on my end of this video.
What is the point of the blind folds?
I love McD's chicken fingers, but Wendy's chicken nuggets are better than McDonalds. Chicken...mmm.
Zaxbys the best
Yo, were Chick fa-la be at
Popeys chicken is too good
Oh highlokjeqids
ASHEVILLE NC REPRESENT
JUNE 3rd is my bday yalllllllkk
I've never heard most of these before
They’re in North Carolina???!
Churches chicken has the best biscuits
Hey I live in Asheville nc
I wish vegitarian chicken strips were more accessible
lol I like how they both knew it was McDonald's when they were not 'lovin it.
Excluding Chick-fil-a cannot be mere stupidity. I suspect malice.
Gotta get that Zaxby’s flown in from the south, son!
Why use Raising Cane if you never been there?
เขายื่นไก่มาเมิงยื่นปากไป ปลอมชัดๆ
Who is the best chicken tender contender?
What about raising canes? Nevermind I watched more
Bloody starvin Nar lol
1:44 Rhett when he hears what he Links said 🥶
My favorite chicken tenders hands down is Culvers. So freaking good.
1:44
rhett: wtf
WTH WHERES CHICK FIL A
Oi I'm in North Carolina
Will it jerky!!
The best blind taste test
can we bring back 10 feet tall tho?
mcdonalds has left the chat
Raising Cane's is way too overrated haha.
Pullen park in Raleigh
Rockys hot chicken shack is amazing!
who calls those chicken fingers. it’s chicken STREEIPS

chicken strips
Missed the best (Bojangles)
When are you going to get bts on GMM???
The reason they rated raising canes so low is because canes chicken is meant to be eaten with canes special sauce
Do one with smosh
did you get spray tan....... you look orange..., and you look embarrassed
Where’s chic fil a
I have one thing to say:                             

CHICK FIL A
I'm going on a strict tendie only diet.
This place in my town called Barry's has the best chicken fingers
No Bojangles?
My favorite chicken tenders are Popeyes and chik-fil-a.
No YouTube drama here !
I’m so excited for mythical chef Josh. I’ve wanted his own show for a while now!
This video was just a proof of Link’s psychic abilities
Chik -  Canes - Mc D and then Pops.
Has anyone ever told you how awesome you guys are?
Oh damn. You guys are coming back a day after my birthday.
Why is McDonalds here and not chick-fil-a
Ahhhh it stinks! Why is this a prize?! 😂
There's a difference between chicken fingers and chicken tenders
Tender is the morning  ; )
YES! Thank you! I’ve always felt that Raising Canes chickens strips cannot stand up on their of without that delicious canes sauce!
NOW I WANT CHICKEN FINGERS UGGHHHHH
Whuuuut. How was Raising Cane's rated so low...
Wow it feels like the good mythical summer was only 12 months ago
Canes is my favorite
i’m vegetarian but i’m still watching this bc i love Rhett and Link
On god how could you dis raising Cain’s like that
Could you guys do an episode crossover of an ice bath while eating a ghost pepper.
canesssss
I like chicken
No Zaxbys!? 😩
June 3rd: Mythical Summer
also June 3rd: my birthday
Who else ate chicken fingers while they watched this
Love Carl’s Jr.
wait do they call hardees carl’s jr. there
RAISING CANES HAS THEM ALL BEAT BY FAR!!!!
I’m not lovin’ it 😂😂😂
Cheese
Anybody been on TENDER lately?
A CHICKEN VIDEO WITHOUT CHICK-FIL-A, IS NOT A CHICKEN VIDEO
KFC for the win I tell ya!
Canes and golden chic are 5 stars
Raising Canes
I’m disappointed I wanted him to say I’m a winner give me Hardee’s chicken dinner
No zaxbys or chik fila??
Honestly Chili's has awesome chicken fingers
On trending!
That's a random selection of fingers. Church's and Cane's are obscure to most of us. Burger King has chicken tenders as does Chick-Fil-A. I've never ever heard of Church's and Cane's and it's weird that Chick-Fil-A wouldn't be used in a taste test about chicken.
Should’ve had Bojangles guys. Your from N.C.!
Rhett - winner, winner, chicken dinner
You forgot Dairy queen and chick fila
Popeyes hit 👍
Dairy Queen??? Lee’s????
اذا  اول  مسلم   تعلق  سوي  اشتراك    بل  قناة  فضل  وليس أمر   اخوك  بل  إسلام
Is my family the only one that calls them chicken strips?
3:02 Try the chicken tenders at Texas roadhouse
GUY'S come on man how can you NOT have Chick-fil-A in this contest?!?!? Oh that's right if it was it wouldn't be a contest lol
No Chick-fil-A?  Pffft...
Rhett’s face 1:44
Raising Cane's, hello???
I would be able to tell you where each was from probably.
2:14 this looks oddly similar to the effigys in the forest
My berth day is on June 3 pliz like this it will make my berth day wish
CANES ?!!!!
To I live in Asheville
That’s what she said @ 3:42
Chicken fingers and chicken tenders are not the same thing.
How about a new idea for a taste test, GMM? These are pretty stale. Especially considering R&L haven't even tried most of these items before
Wendy’s should have been there!!
im disappointed in Rhett he had a soft toss to singing winner winner chicken dinner and he freaking whiffed lol
C H I C K E N  T E N D I E S
I have a question. What logically is the best us state to live in? Try to be as unbiased as possible while answering this question.
every time they saymythical take a shot
who else expected chick fil a
No CFA? Uh oh.
what about chik fil a?
Jollibee chicken beats em all
If they added raising canes I guess it i. nO TIME
Also Rhett in that chicken foot mask will haunt my dreams for all eternity thanks guys ✌
Best chicken tenders in the world are at Longhorn steakhouse hands-down best I’ve ever had from every single store that I have ever been to that is the best.
If it's a mythical MORNING WHY EAT CHICKEN AND NOT PANCAKES
I thought you meant a eat a blind chicken not that you're going to be bling folded lol
Is it just me or Rhett and link need their own mukbang show
Is thinger a word???  No, it’s not.
Where is Keith to do this challenge with them?
Today is nordways birthday or somthing
You forgot Chik fil A
Lol Link guessing the future tender is so funny.
Watching Rhett and link is a breath of fresh air after everything that’s been going on in the world.
Never heard of churches or canes. Where was chik fil a
Mom! Mom! where my tendies at?
Chicken ain't got no fingers!
Is pepperyness a word???  No, it’s not.
whats the song rhett is refrencing in the chicken intro theme song?
Y’all are from NC and neglected Chick Fil A like that? That’s Disrespectful
So sinners smell like raw chicken feet???
Get food from Culver’s
Popeyed got the best tinders has down
gimme gimme chicken tendies
Cant belief they gave canes a low rating
Chick-fil-A, whataburger and raising canes
Bojangles is so good!
Raising Canes? No? Ok.
Chick wat what ?!?!?
Must have filmed this on a Sunday 🙄
Hello I’m new
Chicken  dinner
Okra from churches.  🤗 YUM.  They closed our local churches :(
I could grab their okra and eat it like people eat fries.  Soooo good.  There’s not one close to me anymore :( I ate at that one all my life.  Sad to see it go.
their banter is top notch on this episode
WHERE TF IS CHICK FIL A AND CANE’S?!?!
Wheres Golden Chick 😫
3:00 he's just saying that bc it's not on the top of his weehaw
One bite, Everybody knows the rules.
The best two would have been Popeye's or KFC's because they are dedicated to Chicken but even then it's debatable if they are truly good because they are fast food places.
Blind chicken taste test and no Chick filet?
Did hiLIARy not want Chick-fil-A in your precious little test?
SCHOOL ISNT DONE YET!!! How will I live?!?!?
Am i the only one that says strips instead of fingers?
Ummm chick-fil-a
I had chicken tenders today
bojangles supremes needed to be included
Y’all are missing ZAXBYS
Tendies? But they havent earned their good boy points though. rEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Canes is a1
Who went to get chicken fingers after this
They forgot A&W chicken tenders
I'm vegetarian, why tf am I here.💀
Raising canes is so good
You should put canes that’s the best chicken tenders
Everyone from the south just cringed because he said there’s too much crunch
Where is Chick-fil-A?
1:44 Lol I made that same face as Rhett.
JOSH JOSH JOSH!! Can't wait! 😁
No Chester's Chicken Tenders?
You just gave us Carolina kids a shoutout talking about Bojangles
I'm am there for any videos with Josh!
This guy acts so queer
Can we get more Where In The World Does This Thing Come From
No Zaxbys??!?!?
I think Chruchs chicken is better then popeyes
Hey Rhett and link I have an idea for the next will it ....  will It soda
Chick-Fil-A?
i love how link is always one behind hdjskhdsjdhjs
Popeyes no 1
If only Roscoe's had chicken tenders
Raising Canes!!!
Your guy have a lot fun
I  S T O L E  T H E  T E N D E R
take my like from the barenaked ladies opening.
We all remember Links old haircut in 2016
Raising Cane's is superior to all.
虽然啥也没听懂，但是还是给了一个赞吧
I still have 3 weeks of school! 😭
Church's Chicken underated 🐣
I would of instantly known it was Popeyes or canes but the other ones mess u up
Popeyes all day.
1:42 Rhett trying to keep it in
The challenge starts at 2:08

Los bollos hermanos is the best

Now i want carl jr chicken tender
BRUHS - Wendy's?
Chic fila
Why didn’t they do zaxbys
burger king?
I'm no expert, but aren't all chicken fingers blind?
Canes is the best, but it needs canes sauce to be a 10.
DIP IN HONEY MUSTARD OR NO GO !. #teamhoneymustard
We dont have chicken tinder in mcdo where im from :(
I like your video
You can’t have canes chicken without the sauce
What about Texas fried chicken
4chan has joined the chat
No Bo’s???
They lost me until they started in about the “honesty” of the chicken... lmao.. good clip
See you soon, beasts.
I aint gon a lie carls jrs tenders are good but i like popeyes batter never had churches chicken
Wingstops are the best I don’t even care what anyone else says
Those are some dank chicken tendies
Was Rhett's reaction when ge raged about his chair fake? I just found it
I wanna go on a chicken tender bender...
If there’s metal in it, 100% it’s Tyson chicken tenders!!
HOORAY!!! Blind food
1:43 I-
WHERE IS ZAXABYS
Can’t have Raising Canes without the cane sauce?!
I thought they were going to eat real chicken fingers 🙁
Imagine eating rasing canes without their sauce
So what was the top three chicken fingers?
I would destroy this competition
This was chicken asmr
KFC IS BETTER
Not fair, no ChicFil a
Carl's is same as Hardee's where I live, and they seriously have the best chicken tenders. If you have slept on them you need to try them
Chik fil a let’s argue
You guys forgot about chick fil a fingers
No chick fila
I thought they were fingers of blind chickens
Did they just...Bare Naked Lady? xD
Idk how I got here
No canes ?????😢
ITS GOT A BURNT TASTE PERIODT
Churcus chicken hahahahahaha
you cant have canes without canes sauce its like a law or something
Currently eating chicken fingers. I’m big happy.
What about chick fil a
I must ask, WHERE IS CHIC FIL A?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
im disappointed the winner isn't called chicken tender brian
I feel like something happened between the two
dairy queen chicken fingers >
Country fried steak challenge!! Blindfolded!
why do they talk like that tho
Everyone knows canes wins if and only if you dip it in Canes sauce
U didn’t do bk
No chick fil a?
I love link's shirt! What does it say?
they are returning on my birthday
Canes ???
It’s a tender fender bender
This channel stuck in 2016
The thing with canes it that they purposefully put no seasoning on the chicken so you can dip it in their sauce
Damn..I felt like link has inserted a many of things in his mouth while blindfolded. Against Rhett he professionally found and deep throated the chicken. I can't be the only one who noticed this.
Canes sauce would make it better
Anyone thinking of Woojin of Stray Kids
Have a great break GMM crew, you guys are the best
I graduate June 3rd
Civil and Industrial Engineering are NOT real engineering, especially Industrial.
Is it just Texas that has chicken express
Starts at 2:20 🙄
Hii 😊😊!
You forgot Rasing Canes Chicken Fingers
Can u guys make a video showing your set up
Best tenders are from Publix, Huey Magoo’s, and Zaxby’s...in that order lol.
There are nuggets, fingers and tenderloins. All made differently and not really fair the through them all together and rate.
That BNL parody tho
1:44
hello
The McDonald’s tenders are trash if they aren’t done to order
That mask is scary 😆
wtf is chic fila??
The disrespect to Raising Cane’s is incredible.
1:43
Woooooooo  Barenaked Ladies parody, Canadians ROCK
I was just eating McDonald’s tenders today! I’m sorry I love when my life correlates with GMM lol
cane's is only worth eating if you eat it with the cane's sauce
Wow, 10 on trending
Popeyes wins, the end.
Guy on the right is so cringy
where is Chick-fil-A???????
Lol!! the taste, texture etc comes from how recent the grease in the fryer was changed. The chicken is all from the same source, and the spices are mostly the same
Since when does McDonalds have chicken fingers?
Poppy’s and KFC the best
What happened to the Rhett and Link channel?!
I’ve never watched their music videos in years.
Popeyes all dayyyyyyyyyy
gimme gimme chicken tendies
Not fast food but Chili's has good crispy chicken crispers
Link really needs to think before he speaks
I ❤️ Canes
where the heck is canes?
Where is Raising Cane's
Where is Raising Cane's
Churchs>
Where’s Chick-fil-A
Last time I watched good mythical morning was when for some reason I thought that link was leaving hood mythical morning. I'm glad he hasn't.
Where the heck is chick fil a
Canes is the best! Hands down!
What happened to Chick fil a?
Lol I came here for a smella that
Where is Cane's ??
Canes deserves better
🇸🇴
Raising Canes? 💔💔💔
Anytime link has that mask on it looks like he got stung by bees.
I remember watching this channel when I was in like kindergarten to like 4th or 3rd grade. It’s been a while I’m ending 6th grade next month wow
no chick-fil-a? no DQ? no culvers??? this midwest and southern chicken discrimination is real people
HOW DOES YALL MCDONALD'S HAVE CHICKEN TENDERS. NONE OF THE MCDONALD'S AROUND HERE HAVE CHICKEN TENDERS. IM SOOOO MAD RN OMG
You guys seriously need to go back to Raising Canes and get the chicken with the sauce! There's something magical going on there...
Gonna need you guys to put Lionel Richie back up on the wall.
Also churches is a disgrace to chicken
Chicken tenders ******
They are back the day after my birthday😭
Popeyes and KFC looks the best
Why did they give Link all the skinny ones lmaoo
You can only eat canes chicken with canes sauce
Where is my game canes #onelove
KFC  🛎🛎🛎
I’m sad😢
Let’s get one thing straight. Yes McD’s has tenders. But if you choose it over nuggets you SHOULD go to jail.
They need to do a game where they try to guess what nasty food theyre eating from previous episodes
McDonald's sells chicken now?
You just discounted all chicken eating credibility by not including the true best chicken... Chick-fil-A.
What about wendys
Chick-fil-A
Keith from The Try Guys should do an episode like this with y'all! He's all about fried chicken.
Cane's?
WASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUPPPPP
Yeehaw
Canes is fire
If there is no raisin canes chicken I’m suing
Canes is better with the sauce
watches them eat chicken tenders while eating chicken tenders
Well... I never eaten chicken fingers before ....
It's so sad that they are eating blind chickens.
Just ate the tip of popeyes chicken. That's why it was all crunch you bozos. Gotta get that middle piece.
what song did the tune come from
How is Chick-fil-A zaxbys or bojangles not on this
If you from the south and you’re watching, it’s okay you’re not the only ones disappointed
Youve never tasted raising canes have you?
1:44
What about Chester’s
suprised to see canes at the bottom.
Actually its called hardys
Zaxbys and Canes????!! 😔
My canes chicken doesn't look like that
FUMP MY BUMPY
Lol
I would've sent ya'll a catering sized box of Bojangles' chicken strips. Hit your NC Mythical Beast up next time! I literally live within walking distance of one.
Sometimes I’ll be listening to science video or lecture and deeply thinking about it..... then I scroll bast a gmm video
WHERE'S CHICK-FIL-A
Rasin Canes
Um why is Chick-fil-A not an option????? Hello??? Its chicken!!!
NO CANES?!?!?!?!?
great episode, chickfila deserved a shot tho
Salmonella mask
WTF IS CHURCHS CHICKEN
No raising canes
Rhett always wins
PDQ is the best. If there's not one in your state, too bad for you
It's ending ????!!!!!
OMG literally just talking about this on the drive thru video we did buying the same order as the previous car. McDonalds tenders👎
Cali needs zaxbys
It makes me sad that yall dont have a whataburger
Bring back ltat #bbltat
Avl represent
I love raising canes
chicken fingers oh my......
Cane's is at least a 9 when it's fresh, with the sauce anyway. Theirs must have been a little old
How dare you not include Chick-fil-A
“Chicken tender bender” in title: “Chicken fingers”
You need the SAUCE for canes.
Y’all need some Chicken Express in your life.
RAISING CANE is the best.
As I put the chicken nugget in my mouth I see this video. Great timing
They should have included the Costco chicken tenders, they are pretty good!
Them there supremes from Bojangles... yeaaaaa boi
Do a macaroni one
Cane’s is only good with the Cane’s sauce
how could you disrespect canes like that
I have eaten Raising Cane's twice a week for the past 6 months D-:
I like the videos when you guys just talk about stuff
Canes is the best. Needs the sauce though
I'm surprised McDonald's is there because it's not a straight up chicken place neither Carl's jr in my opinion it should only be chicken fast good places and not a mix
Burnt chicken nugget
Woohoo! Happy summer to you guys! Hope you’re enjoying your break!
I feel bad for nibbas  that dont live near a canes
YES
How are you gonna rate McDonald’s and Cane’s the same. Sure, Cane’s isn’t AMAZING, but it’s nowhere as bad as McDonalds. Smh
You can't give the Canes and not the sauce, you gotta have the sauce and chicken not just the chicken, that's against the law.
Thank you finally a blind test I love these I need these more often
Those are Chicken tenders but ok
Man Link is a genius when it comes to chicken
this is the moment I have been waiting for my whole life
How did Church’s get a better score than Cane’s 😭😭😭
Smosh







Damien SMELLA THAT
If Chick-fil-a was here, it would win real quick.
Canes is the best thing on earth
1:47 
rhett  face
Why does it matter whether the chicken is blind or not?
Why are there so many dislikes?🤔
They parodied a barenaked ladies song Called one week nice
Never heard of Canes, Churchs, or Carls Jr.. are these northern restaurants?
No Chick-fil-a? C'mon now
When it says good mythical morning and it’s made at 2:27 pm
Raising Caines
Why dont r&l open a bojangles franchise in cali then if they miss it so much?
Periodt😂
Y’ALL HAVEN’T BEEN TO CANES?!?!?!?!
Anyone else here during Ramadan? 🤤🤤
I can image someone using a chicken tender as a spear, heck I might 7:40
I freaking love Cane's!
Raising Cain’s is da best.
I love that they're judging the chicken on it's honesty
JUNE 3RD IS MY BIRTHDAY OMG
can confirm carl's jr tenders are AMAZING
Rhett and link:We have never had cane
Me:WHAT TRY THEIR FRIES
lol i smell like a sinner!..
Y'all are gonna be back on my birthday
I like trolling 😂
Can't watch this, there's no chick-fil-a
Nice Bojiggity shoutout.
Can you do the tour of mythicality in ireland
My birthday is tomorrow can you say hi to me plzzzzzzz
After two months of watching GMM from the beginning I've finally caught up to current videos, and it happened right before a break. What am I gonna do without my GMM?
link gave hint when mcdonalds came up..... I'm not loving it in a jingle way lol
Fun fact, if the chicken fingers are labeled "chicken tenders" it means they're actually the tenderloin portion of the breast, if they are strips, is breast meat but not necessarily the tenderloin portion.
All Texans gotta be shook after Rhett & Link’s judgment of Canes >:O
Chicken Fingers: who eats that today? It's processed chicken parts not very far removed from dog food.
He was an absolute excellent guest!!!! We NEED to see people as enthusiastic as him MORE on GMM!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽😁😁😁
Karamo is a sweet angel the world does not deserve him
I guess I'm not that only one thinking this but  I'm going to say it anyways, best guest they've had. and I have never heard of him before.
" Let's not make this about race... but it is right now."
Best guest.
I love how Rhett still didn't let go of Karamo even after the hug was over
If I see karamo in that outfit  on season 4 of Queer Eye I think I might scream 🤷🏻‍♀️
okay but the orange jumpsuit on karamo really does look fly no cap.
This episode is radiating positive energy, and let me tell you IM HERE FOR IT!
Karamo absolutely crushed this episode! What an awesome guy. He was so confident and positive the whole time.
Loved this episode especially the guest. Forget the cowbell... need more Karamo!
Karamo was such a great guest, love his energy. Especially at the next frame when he actually has on the orange tracksuit! Suits him well 👌
This is my top favorite episode in GMM I ever watch.. love Karamo's personality.
I don't usually care for these guest episodes but Karamo was a great guest. 13:10 😂
That Orange tracksuit looked SO GOOOD on him tho!!! The way colors look so popping on dark skin.. so amazing omg!
"Aww, let's talk about that." I LOVE HIM!
12:32 Oh my gosh, his dance <3
Tbh, I definitely like Karamo's personality despite my bias against reality shows.
Best pairing ever! That tracksuit was made for karamo! 🔥
Easily one of the best guests they've had on...heartwarming moment at the end
Link pretending to eat the tuna is literally me trying anything but chicken nuggets and fries 😂
I think I have a new favorite guest 😂 he was amazing
Loving all the positivity in these comments
❤️♥️💜
Karamo is great but the should get Jonathan on the show.
that would funny
"Straight guy in sweatpants" wasnt timed very well contextually
I'm a straight man, but I might start watching Queer Eye just to see Kuramo lmao. Dude has awesome energy
One of the best guests in a while! He just seems to be enjoying it so much and works well with Rhett & Link
He was such a good guest and also I loved his imitations of the other guys.
i did NOT expect to see karamo in a gmm video today but i am SO GLAD i did.
link looks so tiny next to rhett and karamo!
I DIED when he kicked over the chair, what an awesome guest!!!!!!
Karamo was an EXCEPTIONAL guest whose vibes fit the show very well. I appreciate you having him on.
Best. Episode. Ever. I love Karamo!
This guest was awesome. Added so much to this episode. He did a great job :)

And that outfit really is dope
Karamo is my new favorite guest. This was absolutely amazing!
Never heard of queer eye or karamo but I love this guy! Hes funny and fits well with the show. Bring him back!
“you’re going to be testing pomade on kevin who needs some help with his hair.”
kevin: am I a joke to you?
Force link to eat a tuna and tomato sandwich (1080i 60 Hz)
“Awww let’s talk about that” indeed!! What a sweetheart he is. Amazing guest!!!
he actually took the outfit 😂 i love it
Karamo is so nice and funny, and the outfit looks great lol
I love how he just casually changed into the orange tracksuit!
I wish I could’ve heard his Tan impression!!! 😭😭
Ooh just saw the rest of the cast on Steven Colbert’s show and was wondering where Karamo was. So glad to see him on GMM!!
I audibly gasped when I saw Karamo.. and then immediately felt a sense a pride about it 😍🤣🤣🤣.
Every time i do something awesome i want Karamo to say "Proud of you"😍😍💜💜
I’m living for Karamo’s impressions of the other Fab 5
Mr Karamo, you are so Brilliant and a true gentleman. Thank you GMM for giving us another superb 10/10 episode 😀🙏
There’s too much personality in this video

Ok he’s great nvm
Get it Karamoooooo with that orange sweat suuuuit! 👏👏👏 can he be on the show regularly? Haha
Karamo was by far one of the best guests they've ever had on.
Link: it burns when I pee
Rhett: let’s talk about that
One of the best guests by far! His energy is so positive and brio!! You guys must have him on GMM again!
I have never clicked faster! This is my dream crossover!!!!!
I haven't watched Queer Eye but Karamo is very entertaining. Kudos
Karamo’s energy was so infectious. He’s a great guest and I want to see him on everything.
Karamo was one of the bestest guests on this show we need more like him!
book probably i could guess, not so sure about tuna which one has to taste to see what is there
Karamo is one if the sweetest guest they had!
I loved this SO  much more than I thought ! Karamo is great!
I don't typically love the guest segments but I love this guy's energy. What a fantastic guest!

Karamo!!! <3 such a beautiful person, inside and out.
Yessss the collab we don’t deserve but got anyway!!
Will It: Bed?
This guy is great !! Get him permanently on the show
Karamo and Mayim Bialik are my top two FAVORITE GMM guests based on their enthusiasm and positivity! You guys did a great job finding this guy, and Karamo, I love you ❤
Im sooo happy 
I told my brother if he could ONL buy me the gmm mug and the pin but then when the package came which was in 4 days he surprised me with two tee shirts and a sample of the perfume
He's my new favorite guest 😂❤❤❤
One of your best guests yet. The energy was amazing. Made my day!!

Karamo has to be one of my favorite guests. What a sweetheart
"Oo aye" ?
 I've been pronouncing ouai like "way"
I WAS SO HAPPY KARAMO WAS A GUEST!!
Hey a guest I've actually heard of!
Also I'm sad he didn't do impressions of all the guys... I was waiting for them....
Can't wait for Karamo to wear that outfit on season four! 😂
me: dang that orange outfit is nice. i bet the non-matching one is designer, they do that.
karamo: says the exact same thing
me: i feel like a genius
OMG!!! I love Karamo!...Please get Jonathan on the show!!! GET THEM ALL!!! Lol
That pomade was 100% Murray's lol, no doubt about it.
By far the best guest on the show so far
I LOVE QUEER EYE!!!
Absolutely an amazing guest. Get him on again! Loved his energy!
I've heard of Queer Eye and I heard good things about it, but never really felt like it was my thing. Now I feel like giving it a watch. Laughs.
Those sweats were practically made for Karamo! They look so good on him!
Stay drama free as Rhett and Link 😏
When I saw karamo was in this I was SHOOOOOK. PLS GET JVN TOO. OR THE WHOLE DAMN GROUP
I've been watching this show for many, many years, and this was by far my favorite guest to be on so far! No idea who he is but GET HIM BACK!
this was great, big fan, bring him back sometime
well, now i have a new favorite episode
Karamo says he loves everything. I think the Walmart chair would have something to say about that
Karamo is so inspiring! The talk about the books was lovely 💕
This was such a refreshing episode this morning! Karamo is such a good guest, and seemed  to have a really good time. Plus his interactions with the crew was amazing!
I love GMM so much it makes me laugh anytime I watch it.
'Trying new things, I'm proud of you'

The type of reinforcement link needs
GaryVee should do a video with Vinny G

If they wind up liking each other they could start a new channel called Veegies
My favorite guest of all time now 😭😭 love Karamo!!!
I like this guy!!! Never heard of him but he is AWESOME and SWEET!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
$155 for a chair is still pretty luxury
He was so polite and friendly, loved seeing him on the show!
Will it: Tracksuit? Ft. Karamo

I’ve been considering watching queer eye for a bit and he just convinced me.
Awwwww I love him 😂❤

Link didn’t eat the tuna and guessed correctly!!! MIND BLOWN 😂
Karamo is a super cool guy. Looked like he really enjoyed himself! Hope he comes back.
Kevin! I hadn't seen him in a while and I worried. Also Will is one of my favorite newer (or at least more recently introduced) crew members
I loved the original Queer Eye show, and my daughter introduced me to the new crew.  A great guest on a great show.  Nice work, y'all!
I need 100 seasons of queer eye
😂 Rhett literally got the 'Queen sweep' 😂😂
Soulja boy Soulja boy Soulja boy!!!!!!!

Three beautiful men talk. Let's talk about that. Rhett and Link were GLOWING with the presence of Karamo that day, DANG BOYS!
Karamo made me feel good about myself with all of his happiness and good spirit. I was feeling down but he picked me up and i wasn't even on the same coast as him. Amazingly lovely guy.
Let's be real here, that orange looks dope!
rhett seems genuinely so excited to have karamo on i love it
this is a new favorite episode for sure, i love it so much
I literally gasped when I saw Karamo. I loove that show so much and he was such a delight. ❤️
Link didn't eat anything during round 2
 Why
This was such a great episode! I actually woke up in a bad mood, so this has fixed me! More Karamo! More guests like Karamo! He fully committed to the game and never made it feel like he was above being there, I love it!
Kevin lookin' like Ralph Macchio!! #cobrakai

He was so lively. Loved the episode
I'd be down with Karamo being a semi-regular guest on the show. Great energy and seemed to vibe really well with what R&L got going on.
I love how cheerful Karamo is!
One of my favorite guests ever omg
Karamo hands down has to be one of my favorite guests on the show. He is so wholesome, and his energy! Love it. Hope he comes back to the show!

Are we just going to ignore the fact he's saying greazy ?
I need Karamo to be on more episodes.  He is amazing ! Love him :)
This was the best thing ever!! Love Karamo!
The only one that should be hugging and give sweet nothings to Rhett is Cotton Candy Randy. This episode with Karamo was great though. Love Karamo ❤
I literally wake up at 3:00 am watch the new episode then go back to bed is that weird?
That beginning was absolutely amazing 😂😂😂
Karamo was such a great guest. He has such a positive energy that didn't feel fake or forced. Loved the chemistry between you guys. I might have to start watching Queer Eye now lol
I love Karamo!! His impression of the other queer guys is spot on!! Love it!

This episode just really got me into watching queer eye and im sososos haooy! Ive never cheesed this much with a netflix show in 4ever
💙I want to be friends with Karamo. He's like the cool brother that will always be there for you💙
Telling those who are "under-functioning" that they are not, does them a greater disservice than hurting their feelings by being honest.
I love karamo's impressions
1st again at 3 am
Omg, finally someone of color on the show!
Please, I need some Karamo in my life!
YES, love this guest!!!
I love the dynamic between everyone
Tomorrow’s my birthday

I LOVE Karamo, best guest maybe in GMM history!
There are no losers, only love. I like that.
What's a "queer" ?
Omg I love this guy! He’s so sweet and works really well with Rhett and Link. I don’t watch his show but he gives me hope for humanity.
Sees Queer Eye clicks
What a WONDERFUL and positive guest for the show!! Definitely would love to see him on again!
7:56 remind you of anyone in particular???
What an amazing authentic and kind guest this week. Never heard of karamo before but will definitely check his stuff out now
Never really bothered to watch Queer Eye, but since watching him on GMM and how awesome Karamo is, I am going to binge the first season :)
“Greeezey”
I love, love, LOVE GMM- but sometimes the guests can just feel awkward and like they have no clue what theyre doing (even times when I love the guest almost more tham GMM...)

Karamo? Clearly knows how to be his best, whether its TV or online or anything else.  This whole episode just felt so natural and ai adored it :^)
I don’t really care what clothes I wear.

When I Buy I just find the cheapest thing that fits me
We had Rhett and Link on smosh pit, now we need Shayne on GMM.
Omg!!!  he makes so much sense on this show!
I allways knew Rhett is very tall but seeing him next to karamo,who also think of as a very tall man, really shocked me
Okay, he was fun :D
Karamo!!!! My favourite <3 been looking forward to season 4 for what feels like ages already. So excited. They better be back. 😬 :)
I legit loved him as a guest! Super cheerful, positive and friendly. I didn’t see or feel a single awkward moment between the cast
Yesssssss 👏👏👏 loveeeee this vid
He was great from the start but when he put on that orange outfit... perfection
This was absolutely one of the best episodes!
My AP world history exam is this morning so I can't watch gmm right now because I have to do last minute cramming. Please pray for me guys😫
(Groovy electronic Music)
I loved this episode even more!
I freakin love Karamo I love this
Me, I am underfunctional
Will It Mask? 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 wait till October get a set of various liquid rubbers and see how well they make a monster you can wear on your face!
Anyone feel like Karamo made it awkward a lot during the episode?
YES OH MY GOD I LOVE KARAMO
Karamo! This was so entertaining!
You should all Karamo to join you more often.
Karomo is perfect in every way possible
Omg one of my favorite videos by far ❤️❤️❤️
I always get teary or legit bawl during Karamo’s segments on Queer Eye.. I didn’t think I will on GMM but his comment on that book excerpt warmed my heart ❤️ Thank you for being a wonderful human, Karamo ❤️❤️❤️
I like the featured person, aka Karamo, so cool, and nice, and funny
Link looks like an older version of mclovin from Superbad
I don’t think I’ve ever clicked on a notification so fast as I did with this. Also good morning.
Best guest everrrrr
Love him! And he doesn’t look too bad in that orange sweatsuit either. 😘🔥🔥🔥
This was SUPER great. I loooooved this! Please have Karamo as a return guest 🧡 he jives so well with R&L!!!
Karamo 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Thank you for getting more diversity in your guests! 👏🏻👏🏽👏🏿 🏳️‍🌈
Best guest ever. I love that we wore the outfit and knew the chair.
THIS. IS. LIFE
Liked before watching!!!
Omg I love this guy. He’s so nice seeming and amazing. He genuinely made me feel so much happier today.
Love this show. It is the reason I wake.
Karamo was a great guest! Funny!
Karamo=James Charles
Karamo vs cotton candy randy
3:57 astroy boy 2019 coming soon???
Thumbs up for the jersey shore reference in 2019
Karamo is so sweet and funny I love him tons😆😆
One of my favorite guests ever
Round 1 product A is Murrays. I heard the price and saw the orange tin!
The best episode ever. Love the hug at the end. It was so cute and sweet. Link is so cute at the end. He is the best guest. I laughed so hard.
We needs more people like him😖🥰
He’s up there with the cuddle lady
0:16 did link stutter hardcore? or just speak fast?
Karamo is such a cool dude. He seems like that one person that would be friends with everyone
I LOVE KARAMO AND QUEER EYE AHHHHH THIS IS THE BEST
Karamo met the height requirement: right between Rhett and Link so Rhett doesn't look giant and Link doesn't look like a dwarf.
Costco haters!!
11:20 story of my life all the time
Karamo is bloody awesome.
Another day, another mythical evening 🎉
Love it when guests are totally into it :)
air fryer v deep fryer come on
Karamo was awesome!
this is what I've been waiting for
OOOO SHIZZLEEEEEEEEE 
Am early I think :3
We all gotta tweet him to remind him to wear that outfit in the next season
Karamo is such an inspirational person, it doesn't matter what gender or sexuality you are his words speak true for everyone.
Can we please, PLEASE, have more of Karamo?  PLEASE?!
Karamo is the best ❤️
4 views 26 likes? ok youtube
Anybody else got hypnotized every time Karamo spoke? No? Just me?
Karamo was one the best - if not the best - of the guests to appear on the show so far! Hope he comes back on the show soon, 'cause that charisma was hella impressive!
3:41
😤👏 HöÑeŸ
I’m in love with Link. There I’ve said it!!!
Oh my god I will lose it when I see Karamo in that tracksuit on Netflix
666 dislikes “Lucifer comes back”
I'm probably one of the very few who have never heard of Karamo, but I love him ready! He's so happy and nice to everyone, honestly!
G R E E Z Y
Great guest, great episode!
Why wake up for Good Mythical Morning when you could just not sleep for Good Mythical Morning ? 🤷‍♀️
Guys, he’s such a genuinely sweet guest
I love that guy
Best guest hands down and good mythical more was prob the best episode yet
Best.
Guest.

Im a Chef...and more expensive Food is 'NOT' Better! Nor any products....
i love karamo so much oh my god i never expected this!
Thank you for being here and being queer ! Oh yaaaaaas this episode was so much fun ! I love how wholesome he is !
I lol'd at Kevin dressing up to look good for Karamo.
did you have marcus halloway from watch_dogs 2 on your show?
For all you saying you have never seen Queer Eye...


WATCH QUEER EYE!!!!


It will fully change your life.


You're welcome.
The intro was so funy
Watching him kick that chair and dance in 1.5x speed is MAGICAL
We need a whole season of this
He seems like a great guest star but I always thought it was weird when anyone under the age of fifty writes a memoir
Glad to see a person of color! 👏🏽👏🏽
Best gmm guest of 2019 😂
Love that orange suit on both them damn looking great
I love him so much. Best. Guest. Ever.
Karamo was awesome, loved him!
I thought that this channel was safe from something like queer eye. 
Oh well.
This is for sure one of my fav episodes
you should have done this with cologne, like Creed GIT vs Cool Water
Amazing guest! Karamo was so very wonderful! I just adored him you guys should 100% have him back again! :)
everyone needs a karamo in their life.
Just for anyone who doesn’t want to be embarrassed at Sephora like I was: Ouai is pronounced “way”
DEAR GMM CREW:



BEST. GUEST. EVAAARRR!!!!!!
PLEASE BRING KARAMO BACK GOOD MYTHICAL PLEASEEE!! AND THIS IS COMING FROM A 26 YEAR OLD.
P.S. -Who else wants a hug from this amazing queen?! I LOVE HIM SO MUCH HE'S SO FULL OF LOVE XOX thanks for existing GMM!
~♡, Viva La Vanna
This is my favorite episode yet!
OH MY GOD KARAMOOOCIFIFKD
Link!! I like your hair better now than the 2015 video about genetics I just watched. 😂🙌🏼
My favorite guest
Can we please have a Will and Matt show
I usually dont like the quest episodes that much, but Karamo was hilarious!!!!
squeeeee my two favorite worlds have come together! yossssss
I LOVE KARAMO I'm so happy he was a guest
OK so I'm in love with Will.
Karamo is a #novababe
Most wholesome GMM episode ever? 


Yes, yes it was.
A very unique way to advertise Fashion Nova. Smart smart smart!
Karamo deserves that outfit for being that nice of a pereson.
Karamo! You are awesome!
Heck Karamo is someone I need in my life constantly I could feel his like love through my phone. This was amazing. Karamo you are a amazing person and thank you for being like that. And I agree. No one is worthless.
I really hope you actually gave the outfit to Karamo, because he looks damn good in it!
that suit is fire tho for real.
Karamo was excellent!
should get all 5 on
bill nye needs to be a guest lol
I need a warm hug and words of encouragement from Karamo
Omg I love Karamo! Great episode
At 6:05 I literally just started eating my tuna sandwiches I have for lunch.  Not sure if I should continue..
By far one of the BEST guests they've had
Greasy or greezy?
The last round was my favorite cause Karamo just tested the Walmart chair. xD
🤣Love it “I want that outfit!”
Get it brother!
Not familiar with the guest but loved him!
Never before has a person being on GMM made me watch their show
I’m literally sobbing Karamo 😭😭😭💖
He looks like a traffic cone!!😂😂😂😂
We need Billie eilish on gmm
Ouai is pronounced “way”
Karamo is a certified nova babe now
Definitely one of the best guests. Dude fit right in.
He. is, adorable and lovely, what a wonderful guest
YOU GOT A CAST MEMBER FROM QUEER EYE OMG I AM SO EXCITED THAT I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS I LOVE THEM ALL!!!!
Will it Shoe!?
Guest like him really warms you up, I smile the entire episode <3
Huge respect for a man who when presented with a unique opportunity doesn't hesitate to seize it on the spot.
Amazing guest!!
how did y'all miss the opportunity to have cotton candy randy come in for wispers also after karamo
karamo matches the orange one
I normally don’t like the episodes with guest, but this was a great ep. He fits right in! Please have him on again.
We love Karamo!!! ❤️
I love you Karamo
Karamo is so wholesome. Please have him on more.
@ The intro: Karamo is THE ONLY star of Queer Eye. There’s only one. No one else. Just Karamo.
He just made me so happy I teared up. Pleeeaaaase come back!
I half expected cotton candy randy to bust in screaming "Who's whispering in my daddies ear?!"
Such a great guest and episode. 💖💗💖
May have to watch Queer Eye, Karamo is entertaining AF.
this was so wholesome
Sometimes I feel underfunctioning.
yesss karamo! I've never been so excited for a guest
YESSSSSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
KARAMO MY BABYYYYYYY
I love so much that Karamo is on today's episode!!
Omg I usually won’t watch guest episodes but I am HERE for this
idk who karamo is, but i love him
Please have JVN on next!!
You need to have Karamo on more often..he was great and sooo good looking and funny. Karamo looked great in the sweat suit. You guys are awesome!
Looked like Murrays pomade  from walgreens. One of the o.g pomades.
Agreed that orange outfit looks dope af
karamo was the best guest!
Yesss love Karamo
Wow love this guy 😭😭
Probably the most wholesome episode I’ve seen so far
I love Karamo!!
I love Karamo!!!! Such an awesome person
OMG he's so sweet
BEST.
GUEST.
EVER.
One of the best guests ever.
This was great! Love Karamo!
Just a moment to acknowledge Link pretending to eat the tuna.
This is my favorite guest that has ever been on GMM
Best guest since Post Malone
OK I wanna be him when I grow up!!
I love how short Link looks, even though he’s still 6ft
I want a hug from Karamo 🥺
I had no idea who karamo was but now i love him!!!
Pomade you could tell just from packaging
Now we need Jonathan Van Ness on here!!
I love karamo !💙🧡💚💜💛❤️🖤
I've never seen Karamo before (only watched old episodes of QE), but he is adorable.  I love that he loves that orange outfit...looks so good!!!
You HAVE to have Karamo on again
I really liked this episode
BEST GUEST
I love this guy
He's one of the few hosts I find bearable on GMM. I find a lot of them cringy.
I LOVED THIS EPISIDE. HE'S SO SWEET
At first I thought you were going to say you win a Warm Hug and Whispered Words of Encouragement from Cotton Candy Randy
Spanish?😔😭
Yessss best guest ever. Lovely enthusiasm.
I would  love to see Tom Ellis #lucifer on the show sometime!!
This episode made me uncomfortable but I'm not against it. Its like someone who get weird about animal cruelty.
NOW THIS IS A GUEST I CAN GET BEHIND
do one with JOHNATHAN
Karamo is a TOP TIER GUEST, if he never returns I'll be disappointed. I get it if he doesn't have anything new to plug but I just wanna see him on this show again, what an absolute treat
Omg can Karamo be my dad wtf
AW!! Hes so great! what an awesome guest!! get more of the fab five on!!
HE ACTUALLY TOO THE SWEAT SUIT!!111!11!!!!!!1 Love it!
So funny 😆  please let him keep that outfit!
Why did I start crying when he was giving Rhett words of encouragement 😭
Love the guest and his new outfit.
also love that these two 40 year old dads cuff their jeans
What a nice dude
Y’all have had some amazing guests on this season and I am HERE FOR IT
I have got to watch Queer Eye! I love him!!
I loved this. You need to get the whole Fab 5 on here! I would love that
Best guest ever
I love Karamo, and the other new Queer Eye fab 5 guys.  Thanks for having him on the show.  Although, I would be curious as to what would happen if you have the Try Guys on again like you did last GMS.
You have no idea how happy I was to see Will from Sourcefed trying on clothes :')
I like him, can we keep him?
Best guest on GMM
I'd never heard of this guy before (to be fair, I don't keep up with pop culture and all), but I must admit, HE IS AMAZING
Love Karamo! 😍
Finally someone almost as tall as Rhett
Best guest!!!
I just felt happy for the first time in weeks thanks karamo
Amazing guest!
I really need the rest of the Fab5 to be on here.... this was such a freaking good episode.
The outfit 80s B Boy
I love him.. he is an awesome person
When he kicked the chair 😭😂
link seems so short here LMAO
Karamo has been such a role model for me as a new social services professional on how to encounter people and show them their feelings are accepted! I admire Karamo's way of doing it so much! 💕
4:35 it's Antoni is it not?
Loved this guy! although I’m not a huge fan of guests on the show, I enjoyed this episode
The excerpt from "control the crazy" sounded like "catcher in the rye"..
This was great
I've never watched queer eye but this guy is so likable
so happy Will found his place on gmm
Lmao I think Karamo should forever be on GMM.
I've never seen queer eye, but this guy was a delight, best guest you've had on yet!
I do have to say that Karamo does look great in that orange getup. I don't watch Queer Eye, but I'm curious if he stays true to his word and wears it on the show. He was a fantastic guest, by the way; Rhett and Link definitely need to invite him back to the show.
Awww what a great guest!
❤️loovee the new intro
Please be a international taste test for the finale next episode
ahhhhh when your favs collab
Let's go I got the QUEEN SWEEP
y’all should try to learn asl for a video.
Loved this episode!
The group hug at the end got me :,) so sweet
Happy to see my boy Will poppin and lockin in tracksuits @ gmm! Proud of u
rhett is wearing the most dad shirt ever.
This was awesome!
I have a love for Karamo after the outfit change like no other now wowow
I love Karamo. I wouldn’t mind if he was every special guest from now on.
Interesting  game, Guest was hilarious
Favorite guest ever!
One of the best guests ever! Ahhh I love him so much
He does look damn good in orange
Favorite guest! Please bring in all the Queer Eye guys.
Amazing guest! 😂
Was that Will from Sourcefed??
He Was soo fun!! And Seriously He looked good in that Orange ! FashionNova Wow
“Good for you. Trying new things, I’m proud of you.” What a kind man.
Infinity War got nothing on this crossover
Will ... as in William Haynes???
i dont even watch queer eye but hes so great. i love this episode
i love karamo, you're such a sweetheart, i almost cried when i heard the words of encouragement at the end... and fly orange outfit, i think it would be even better if there was one with a gmm logo
I love him, I love them, I loved this.
Who else looked for the hoodie immediately
FAVORITE EPISODE OF THE SEASON
I’ve never seen queer eye but omg i NEED to now karamo is the type of friend everyone needs.
Best episode!
I LOVED this guest. When he took the sweatsuit I died.
I too am slightly confused about the pomade situation?? I thought y’all hated greasy hair?
BEST GUEST EVER
Karamo is amazing!
I really want to read that book. I love the act of reading a nice book and actually enjoying what you're reading. Other than just getting a book for aesthetics and sitting at a Starbucks for show
I have trust issues with Rhett going 5/5 because of the pizza crust episode
best guest and best episode
Best guest ever.
I don't think Rhett or Karamo ever caught on that Link didn't actually try the tuna!
THIS WAS ADORABLE
Definitely one great guest. I enjoy the show when you have people like him.
I never knew something was missing until now. Karamo needs to be a monthly guest. I like him even more than I did before!
There are very few times I like the guest but this one was really good
I've never heard of Karamo before this episode but he has quickly become one of my favorite guests. It'd be awesome to see him as a regular guest. It seems like he just naturally fits in and has been in the fold for awhile. Definitely going to check out Karamo's book. 

Can Jenn (😍 my mythical crush) start a Mythical Book Club series? I feel like I get half of my reading recommendations from GMM these days. We need a GMM book club and definitely more Jenn!!
I thought I couldn’t like anyone more than Post Malone as a guest, but damn this guy is amazing!
I need to see Karamo doing orange justice in those clothes
I don't watch Queer Eye so I don't know who he is really, but I can tell you that he's an amazing guest. So energetic and vocal. He gave his opinion and took the show as his own, since this episode was his episode. Incredible.
I’m binging queer eye right now and I loooove Karamo! You guys should collab with the whole fab 5!
I love how no one even cared that Link didn’t eat the tuna.😂
2:57 he's totally right in Germany pomade is only used by old men for his beard
Love our Karamo!
5:35 link didn’t even have anything on his fork
Oh my god, Karamoooooooo!!!!!!!! Yassssssss 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
this episode is an absolute dream
Yes!!!! Now we need the rest of the fab 5 on as guests!
Amazing guest
It's my birthday today. I'm 16😁🎉
The way he says ‘greasy’ KILS me!
I love this one!!!
That outfit change was hilarious!
Link looks short in that trio
Aw Kevin 😍💙
I like Matt, he’s a great addition to the mythical crew.
Amazing episode!!!
I. Love. Queer Eye. I. Am. The. Happiest. Ever.
Wiiiiiiiilllll!!!!
I LOVE KARAMO
Karamo!! 😍
Loved this episode!
im bisexual but straight passing. depressed and wear sweats. ive gained some useful information today.
Please put Brad Leone from bon appetit on this show😍
i love karamo so much
Love this so much
Honestly???? Best guest ever.
I need more karamo in my life
Karamo is the best guest we’ve ever even had he is so sweet and funny
Dude with the orange outfit looks like vector from despicable me!!!!!!!!!
Far and away my favorite guest you've ever had
I don't have the slight idea of who the guest is or what is Queer Eye, but he was such a sweetheart and fun guest that I want to be friends with him hahahahaha
Pretty sure Karamo is the real winner here being able to double hug Rhett and Link
karamo will be a great dad
YESSSSS. So excited to watch this.
Rhett was so very enamoured with Karamo #Karhett
Greazy
what a fun group of hip dads
Link pretending to eat tuna is honestly a m00d
When he kicked over the chair omg 😭😭☠️
Best episode.
I wanna be his friend
i bet you can make someone cry by hugging them and whispering believe in yourself.
What a good ep
They didn’t cover the first product up well. I could tell A was Murray’s pomade easily by that orange can
My three favorite people. This episode makes me so happy!
I have never seen and episode of queer eye and I didn't know who Karamo was at the beginning of the episode but I think he was an excellent guest. I love his energy and that he seems up for anything. He has GMM spirit and it's awesome!
This was an extra happy episode!
Orange on orange like Naruto
Oh my god the whole cast would be amazing but I need to see Tan and Jvn especially to see what they think of their hair and fashion 😂 and for antoni to taste josh’s food omg
My boyfriend just dumped me 😭😭
Genuine question, is it actually safe to eat Costco tuna raw? I thought it had to be sushi grade to eat it raw.
Awesome guest!!!!!!!
What a great guest! One of my favorite episodes in a while.
1:27. BAA
It’s nice when you have a good guest. I like him.
When people say they dislike guests on GMM, I just think of genuine, likable guests like this and I smile.
YAYYYY please have Jonathan next
Karamo is so chill
Waiting for Tan to comment on this vid
this guy is lovely
All I want in life is a warm hug and whispers of encouragement from Karamo.
How would you all feel if Rhett and Link switched seats for an entire episode?
I hope he really got to keep that outfit haha
Don’t sleep on Costco!
Who is he? He's incredible!
4:12 distant goat BAaAaAaAaAaAaa!!!!
You gonna tell me the guy in the orange suit doesnt look like the enemy from despicable me?
I have actually spent $25 on pomade...
He's a tall guy.
5:28 ain’t nothin’ on link’s fork
Be honest i don't know much of anything about him but he had to be like the best guest ever
greezy
The last round was the cutest thing ever
5:52 link didn't actually get any tuna😨
Best everrrrr
I immediately recognized Murray’s pomade
Remember when that guy with the beard got angry
This is the most wholesome guest I've ever seen on the show. I'm pretty sure he just made me whole day better!
The pomade one was super obvious.
How do we summon Cotton candy Randy?
Anyone remember their Walmart song?
What a dad shirt on Rhett! lol
The street cone jacket looks pretty nice
greas-iey lol
coolest guest ever
Well now im gonna watch queer eye..
I LOVE QUEER EYE
Omg I love himmmmmmm
Wasn't he on The Real World?
Love love love love Karamo!
"Two?!"
This is a guest invite done right
rhett, link, and karamo made those chairs look tiny
wow!!! i love!!! him!!!
link lied.
Yaaassss Karamo ♡
The luxury of being a famous quest is you get to take Rhett and links props hahaha.
I LOVE KARAMOOOOO
I like Karamo, I dont think I would like the show though.
Hi I'm a big fan of GMM from Bangladesh🇧🇩 can I get a thumbs up from GMM? please?
Two of my favorite shows morphed into 1
Two of my favourite things combined! Queer eye and GMM !
Best guest yet!
One of the very few times I was not disappointed by a guess he seemed to WANT to be there and that's a game changer :)
Did he buy his first home on RedFin?
There’s only love ♥️
I WANT RHETTS SHIRT.....WHERE CAN I FIND?   MYTHCAL STORE??????????  STOLE MY DADS 70's SHIRTS LIKE EM!!!
Reverse Oreo
Who Is this guy I love him!!!!
I've never watched Queer Eye, but I'm all over it now. Karamo is as dope as that outfit.
Please get him back on #bestguest
Can we please have Jonathan on the show Im begging.  OR MAYBE ALL FIVE :OOOO
Can you guys do a episode on Ebike
Petition to bring the other guys on GMM too!
he literally looks s o  g o o d in those orange sweats, like?
You guys should do will it milkshake
from all of the GMM's video so far... i really love this one
Hug him, Rhett!
Best. Gmm guest. EVER
I don't recall a guest who seemed to be happier to be on the show.  Sure, plenty of them enthusiastically play along, but he seemed like he really wanted to be there.
This is the greatest day of my life, I thought this was a fever dream.
I usually don't like when there's guests but man I just love Queer Eye so much. Karamo is my fave too.
Is it just me or do Link and Karamo look like they could be related?
The ending was wholesome dhdhsshsjjsdjsjsjjsjsjsjsjjsjsjsjsjsjsj
I love him as a guest, please have him again
Anyone else get DBZ vibes from that orange outfit? Like the first thing I thought of was Goku lol.
PLEASE DO AN EAR BISCUITS EPISODE WITH HIM!!!
Best video!
Can we get JVN on the show please
If Karamo's name was in the title of this video I would have clicked on it LIGHTYEARS before I did. Now I need every Queer Eye guy on GMM!
1:27 BAAAAAAAAAAA
getting that tracksuit
One of the best guests yet!! He was such an amazing and comfortable guest, and his energy was truly amazing. Queer Eye and Karamo are fantastic <3
5:00 he says to sleep on Costco Costco helped me beat my childern.
I want a hug... ;-;
11:17 did link say wtf
And then the guest star became Naruto.
Only that jump suit is fire
I LOVE KARAMO!!!! also love that he put on that outfit
I got them all right!
So much love!!
WHATTTTT, THIS IS THE CROSSOVER I NEEDED
Wait, why is William Haynes here and no one is addressing it?
YAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSS KAMAARROOOOOO MY BBBOOyYYYYYYY
think i need to watch queer eye now
I’ve never heard of the guest, but I literally smiled through the whole video. What a delightful person, and what a fun episode!
Oh my god this man is so awesome!!! I hope they have him again soon.
You should do a water tasting test.
Come on Karamo, you didn't recognize that Murray's?
wow a guest that is actually good to see on the show.
KA RA MO YAS
Now i want JVN to guest too!
Awwww, Let's Talk about that
I love him.
Best guest ever.
I wanna see an entire episode of this guess the NY bestseller round like if u agree

Lol he stole the show it was great
Crab people crab people crab people
Karamooooo! 💕
Can we get Karamo to host gmm???

Should’ve been using Mythical pomade
Is he gay? 🤔
AHHHHHH KORAMOOOOO

Yeah! You got Karamo!
Good stuff
I wish they would've use the pomade properly
WHAT GLASSES IS HE WEARING??????
mmmm link took a nice big bite of tuna

What a likable person
Isn’t that Will from Source Fed? When tf did that happen?
Greazy
Greazy
Nooo the season finale is tomorrow. Idk what I’m going to do without GMM 😬
Hmmmm, hes a gay guy that likes straight guys in sweat pants..... seems familiar...
wheezes KARAMO!!!!
I really need a Karamo to get m through the day
This was lovely
I’ve never wanted to work for GMM more.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how perfect Rhett and link's hair is compared to kevin's? Sorry kevin
I LOVE HIM
I thought it said luxury bread, got excited.
I thought it said luxury bread, got excited.
i wonder if they film this during the morning or at night
What a cool guest
The murrays pomade was so obvious lol
The best GMM guest ever!
Yessssssss
This dude spoke over rhett and link whole episode felt like good mythical kurram feat. Rhett and link
Link pretending to eat the tuna... Weak, man...
I love there guest!!! ❤️❤️❤️
He was awesome  lol
You guys where great on smosh’s try not to laugh
That was fun. Excellent quest host.
Nobody gonna talk about how he said “the thing about gay guys is that we love straight guys in sweat pants”?
Awesome episode
Cotton candy randy needed to talk to the loser 😭😭
Another great guest! This season of GMM has had a lot of great people on :)
Karamo💖
This was a joy.
What a fun guest.
awww an OG member, but only for a second - theres only a couple of you left eh? Still nice to see his familiar face for a moment.
the thing about the designer vs fashion nova was A looked poorer in quality, not that fn looked designer lol
YASSSSSSSS
Did he keep it? The outfit
I love queer eye
KARAMOOOOOO
Great episode guys
I am so glad you introduced me to Karamo, I now am going to go buy his book <3
Kevin was awkward at first
GREAT GUEST
hey there will
I have never been more entertained in my entire life
😏😂😢good episode
In round 2 link didn’t even try it lol
Anyone else wish he explained how he knew the answer to the last one?
I like when they have a guest who is actually the same size as them. Rare.
2:06 Kevin looks offended lol.
Why didn’t link eat the tuna
karamo!!!!!!
Pokay
You could tell that chair was from Walmart because Orange is one of the colors from the college series
He looks a bit like Jordan Peele
I don’t have depression but I think karama just cured everything bad I’ve ever felt
Love Karamo!
Is this the only guest they haven't dwarfed?
I’ve been really hoping for you to have the queer eye guys on to do “year eye with queer eye (and two straight guys)”
Didn't think you could say "queer" anymore regardless if it is appropriate or not because it might "OffENd SoMEbOdY"
wow i loved him!!
I feel like I’ve missed a lot but what’s queer eye? 👀 don’t @ me
Link didn’t even took a bite of that tuna.
Pomade A was Murrays. I can see the orange on the can
Hes such a peach
DADS
U like fortnite
Karamo in that orange outfit is everything!! His dance moves are fire.
KARAMO!!!! aaaahh i love him so much, i hope you get more of the queer eye guys on the show!!
Karamo is by far my absolute favourite guest on here!!
I'd love to see him again👏🏼👏🏼
I love this game! They've done so many versions of it and it's still my favorite! Always makes for a good episode!
KEVIN!!!!! OH MY GOSH I MISSED KEVIN!!!

Hey link he wheel like to go counter clockwise
I'm watching this while getting ready for an interview. Thanks for calming my nerves GMM!
Karamo is such a sweet guy ❤️

"greazy"
“Queer eye joins tw” close video
LOVE this!
Whenever they show Will on camera, I realize that I totally forgot he's a Mythical crew member and I get really excited to see him! lol Will is awesome! Matt is awesome! Will & Matt are awesome! Karamo is awesome! So many people I love to see in one episode! Love it! Karamo is so fun and a treat to the eyes! ;)
Greazy
At 5:45 he faked eating the tuna lol
What a delightful guest!
Please get Jonathan next
This is the straightest gay guy I've ever seen
awesome guest
Awesome! He's adorable 😊
“You’re losing but you’re clearly winning” All I want in life tbh
I LOVE BUDGET STUFF THE CHEAPEST THE HAPPIER I AM
One of the greatest quests I've seen on GMM. LOVED IT!!!
Loved it!! Karamo has the mojo. Best guest ever.
THIS DUDE WAS AMAZING!
Karamo was the best guest!  I love him and all of you!  Ben rocking that orange outfit slayed me!  Fly AF!!!
Karamo is possibly the best guest they have ever had. I just want to be his friend.
Link seems to really love hugs. Lol.
Queer Eye and GMM?! ... best morning ever!!
Watching Karamo slide/kick that chair made my morning. PLEASE have him on GMM at least once a month. I'm serious.
Karomo is so awesome!  Great episode
Karamo is  one of the coolest people ever
One of the kindest, most genuine guests they've ever had.
0:51 so would Robert Kraft
We need more karamo
We love Karamo
Finally, a guest I can get behind
The queer eye guy is funny, I like him.
Greazy hair.
will it mash potato?
But who is the hateful grandma?
Oh god I love him so much. <3
Karamo was such a great guest. Loved this episode
This gmm made me smile so many times❤️
One of the best guest in a long time.
Have more of the fab 5! Like another hair cutting/styling video but Jonathan is the judge/ person that shows what it really looks like sort of like the dance episode with Derek Hough
He needs to come back. Probably the best guest so far
slightly disappointed that they didn’t play “year eye with two straight guys” 😂but karamo was such a great guest!
Single budget chair costs 155$?
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!
Great show guys!
Kevin is so shy..
I love how much he talks about the other guys on queer eye, you can tell they are all very good friends in real life 💙
This. Collab. Is. What. I. Needed. OMFG.
KARAMO!!!!
0:03 Their laugh in unison was both somewhat pleasing and slightly unsettling 😞😕
I have no interest in watching Queer Eye.... until I watched this guy.
Y’all should have Tom Ellis on here one time
Am I the only one who doesn't like him?? Lol jk
i think his love actually penetrated my cold skin, thumbs up
that was interesting....
His skin is so clear.
WE STAN! Love queer eye. Definitely one of the most meaningful and best guests you've had
MORE. KARAMO.👏  He was a fantastic guest.
Karamo is awesome. Great guest! Love Queer Eye as well
Damn i really wanted that orange tracksuit... DAMN YOU KARAMOOOOO
He's actually precious.  🤗😍
One of my favorite episodes ever!  He brought it, and people definitely felt that real love energy!
I've never seen the new Queer eye but Karamo makes me want to. He's got amazing energy
YEESSSSSS!!!!!!!!! I LOVE QUEER EYE AND KARAMO!
Please have the whole Queer Eye on if you can. This was so funny and enjoyable. I think is one of the best guest videos. ☺❤
Damn, I didn't even rest my smile even for one second for the whole episode.
Those words of encouragement made me cry, such meaningful words from one of my favorite guests they have ever had on the show!
Karamo is a #Novababe
Queeeeen 😍😍😍😍
If Queer Eye isn't renewed, he should just be your third host 😁
you guys need to get logic on an episode! like so they see this
I love this guy !!
Such a amazing channel
1:26 BAA!
Okay you guys need Karamo to be a guest like once a month tysm
Omg amazing please have him again
Love him!! Going to start watching Queer Eye just cuz of this!
Best episode in ages! What an amazing guest!!
Never heard of Karamo, but he's a dope dude
Link was really in his element in this one
This was so fun to watch! Karamo was a great guest :D
I'm glad I read the comments first. I was concerned this was another Wish-like episode.
Okay that last set was amazing. We need more of that.
We need more Karamo!!
I haven’t watched Queer Eye but I gotta say I love Karamo!
KARAMOOOOO love himmmmmmmmm
I thought it was Denzel
Loved Karamo’s energy! We need more guests like this!
Bring him on again!
Rhett, please don't wear that shirt again. The ever so close misalignment drove me insane.
Wow! Today's guest was incredible! I loved when you guys had Markiplier, but this was awesome too!
KARAMO
I'm officially invested in Queer Eye. I never watched it before because fashion and the like aren't my jam, but this guy is great
I’m surprised that they haven’t had Micheal from vsause on good mythical morning
This is so grate
5:26 Link did not eat the food
1 minute in and already set the record for queer said the most
I normally don't like episodes with guest stars but Karamo was great! He didn't completely steal the spotlight and his sense of humor really worked with Rhett and Link's. They all just worked together really well!
And I would have stolen that orange outfit too lol
Oh man...please have him back!!! That. Was. Fantastic. 👏🏻✌🏻💖
This was one of your best guests so far !
Really karamo. Dodgers hat 🧢.  🤢 . At least he had the Giants orange and back on after
I don't know the guy, but I Like it a lot one of the best guest i've seen
I think this is the first time smn overshadowed Rhett and Link
THE BEST GUEST
Karammmooo 😱
Such an energetic and happy guest.  True embodiment of Mythicality
Link didn't even eat the tuna XD
As a bi gal, I gotta say, we all like straight guys in sweatpants.
Link doesn't like anything.
Will it:Dog?
I LOVE Karamo!
Kevin!! We don’t see him enough! I’d love to see him more on those games with the crew on more!
Haven’t even watched yet but I’m in love, would love to see the rest of the queer eye crew
I love him
too pure
Cool dude.. But anyone else getting sick of all the guests? Like, I watch Good Mythical Morning. Not Good Mythical Morning and their +1
Link seems like the kinda guy who would have a pet seagull
So when is Bill Nye going to be on GMM unexpectedly?
When you fart and sneeze at the same time. Your body takes a screenshot.
morgan morgan, famous actor, back at it again with the winks
Yes!!! Morgan!!! He makes every day great!! I really wish he would be on camera more but I know he doesn't like it.
Well you guys just started a thing with the Morgan wink.
😂😂😂 that ending was EPIC. 😂😂😂 y'all never cease to amaze me. Please never stop being your hilarious selves. I love y'all to bits.
I hope the Morgan wink becomes a running gag
Remember the episode where "D" was the answer? That was one of the greatest moments in GMM history.
I must admit, I was not expecting that golf cart at the end
For the amount these two imitate and make fun of each other how did Link NOT make imitate Rhett for that laugh at 4:11 ??! That was incredible, I've never heard anything like it.
oh wow morgan is attractive. Great video as always! I legit jumped at the golf cart
That ending gave me the biggest jumpscare..
The golf cart into the Morgan wink was the best combo ending ever
The fish thing is in Brazil

Dialogue:

Gibberish

You gotta go deeper love

Aiaiai protect your face dad

Hold oooon
The real question is who DOESNT know bill nye
petition to get morgan subtly involved in more videos like he was here
13:54 - That was the most hilarious outro in the history of GMM!
It was totally unexpected to have Morgan Morgan at the end winking again! Great show guys loved it
Great episode guys! Classic GMM. Thanks for making me smile, I really needed it today. Now I'm gonna go be my mythical best! (Right after I watch GMMore :D)
"I hope you find what you are looking for"
Rhett is the king of dad jokes, just saying.
( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
We should get Morgan winking on a green screen on the next LTAT(for the memes).
2:57 B was my prediction before they said anything 😕😕😕😕😕
The fish are Asian carp.  They are an extremely invasive species in the Mississippi.  Giving the set up, probably a fish farm of some sort.
I was hoping the last answer would be d because that’s unexpected
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 91: "Morgan Morgan!!!" - Rhett and Link
I literary screamed when the golf cart hit them!! I don’t know how to feel anymore. 
(Love the Morgan winks)
"thank you for liking, commenting and subscribing" 

"You know what time it-AHHHHHH" 

Me: WTF just happened?!
Could you guys  do a Famous last words video??! I cried tears of laughter every time I watched them XD " Oh look, berries!"
that ending was just so perfect and unexpected!
13:57 I JUMPED OUT OF MY SKIN! Such great editing, so unexpected XD.
Wubuhello 😊
How many snacks they got there named Morgan???
Link is wearing the best break-up gift ever.
An episode where Morgan appears 3 times is my kind of episode. 
Oh yeah, and the golf cart.
I was not expecting to see Rhett and Link getting run over by that
golf cart.  LOL.
Rhett- "I'd have to get naked and press my whole body against him."
Link- "We gotta get that."
Damn that Morgan wink was everything.. Thank you Link ❤️
It would really make my day if u do a will it guacamole the next day
This was so EXPECTED 🤔! Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
When you realize it's 2019 and Smosh still exists. Then you realize Mythical Entertainment owns Smosh.
I love quiz episodes. Nice break from the high intensity episodes (which I also love).
Also, loved the ending! xD
Beginning brought me back to "Is that a mole? Narcissist" ha ha ha! One of the best jokes you've made Link!
I didn't expect a video about expecting the unexpected
Sees the title: What happens next? 

Me: transfer student shows up one day with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. humongous hungolomghnonoloughongous
I saw Morgan in the review? of the video and immediately clicked! Gotta love Morgan Morgan, the handsome actor!
After Hearing about Smosh, Im happy Rhett and Link Adopted them :D
Rhett was in a real sarcastic mood this ep. I enjoyed it.
I LOVE THAT ENDING!!!!! BOTH OF THEM!!! The forklift and Morgan!!! Lol
Lmao definitely wasn’t expecting the golf cart at the end 😂
I named my son Lincoln, link for short 😍 love you link!
I gave this video a like simply because Morgan winking at the camera 🤷🏻‍♀️
“The man is an inch tall” is that a Guardians of The Galaxy vol. 2 reference?
I didn't expect neither the golf cart not  morgan at the end! Morgan is like the Spanish Inquisition
Honestly feels good watching them in the morning
A statue should be ' erected' for ' punmaster' Rhett 😂😂😂
Holy petunias! That wheel video 😂🤣😂🤣
That ending was AMAZING😂 Rhett's shriek thoughXD
There should be more Morgan in front of the camera! JS. ✌🏻
I LOVE LINKS SHIRT SO MUCH!!!  This was a great ep ❤️❤️😂😂
EPIC T-SHIRT IDEA ..... the Morgan wink shirt. Call me, lets talk business.
what i expected: 2 adults reacting to meme vids
what i got: corny dad humor
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT GOLF CART AT THE ENF OF THE GAME— I’m- speechless
Missed opportunity, not having Cotton Candy Randy driving the golf cart, lol.
Really loved seeing Morgan break the laws of physics in the episode ✌
You guys were great in the new Try Not To Laugh Challenge from Smosh 😂
I second another person's comment.....PLEASE GET BILL NYE ON THE SHOW
I love you guys sooo much I've been watching since link had that old haircut and ever since ❤️
You guys were so funny trying to make each other laugh with Smosh. I suggest you guys do a Try not to laugh and the one who laughed first will eat or drink something mysterious. Also maybe do it with the staff so not only you guys will suffer ;). I LOVE your videos!! Been a mythical beast since link's old hair
Well, that ending was surely unexpected.
So I love in Cincinnati can you explain why you chose us
THIS IS TH E ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY TO BE AWAKE AT 5AM BESIDES COFFEE
I'm insist Morgan wink randomly in random videos from now on. Unexpectedly awesome. 😂
Best wink ever, Morgan!! 
OMG THAT ENDING XD
I literally jumped right before the wheel outro, and then was so surprised when I saw Morgan Morgan wink again! Omg what a day 😝
Fml you got me with that ending. I jumped. 😆
Link's shirt feels like a specific message. Thanks for that.
SO FACTS! “A generation of narcissists” loll
Those fish are Asian Carp, they are the most invasive spicies of fish on the planet.
honestly the golf cart thing almost made me pee myself, so well done. also morgan morgan is such a good sport!
Hi Mythical team, I've never been here this early so please think about doing Indigenous Australian foods taste testing! Witchety Grubs FTW!
What an amazingly unexpected video!
6:10 LOL! Link laughs even though, He Got It Wrong.
We the mythical beasts desire more Morgan winks.
Next gmm merch idea: Morgan’s winking face on a T-shirt
Oh my gosh. My heart just jumped at that unexpected ending.
I'm just finding out who Morgan is...and I like it. 😉
7:23 


Link: "Number 15.."
Me: "BURGER KING FOOT LETTUCE."
those Morgan Morgan winks were exactly what I needed this morning
it's wednesday my mythical dudes 🔥
Watched that Smosh Pit video was hilarious. Link playing Link was hilarious
Jumpscared, better then 90% of these horror films
Ok but. Morgan is hot tho
Loved this episode bc Morgan showed up! Always glad to see some crew cameos!
Never been this early before!! Good morning everyone!!🤪
What's that classic joke they were talking about?
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY!
The golf cart into the Morgan wink was best ending ever
Well... I did not expect that ending if we’re being honest
I need to find the origin video of the whole Morgan Morgan thing, I remember watching it but idk what episode/more
Is it me....or is Morgan pretty hot?
Early squad!!! Been here since season 3!!!!! 
Love your content!!!
Morgan's the Johnny Depp of GMM
Omg your the best channel ever!!!! Keep growing and keep up the best vids!!!!!
Number 15: Burger King foot lamb
13:56 that was legit unexpected and startling.
The star of the video MORGAN MORGAN!
I searched for smosh pit just before they said about the video 
It was such a coincidence
The reason both lambs had a #15 on them was to tell which sheep ewe they came from. The ewe was also marked with a 15. Some people use letters, this is just another way of keeping the lambs and the ewe together in case they got separated.
"the world of goth"😆
Also, Morgan😉😉
4:33 r/punpatrol freeze a-hole drip the pun and this will go down easy
What a great time to make coffee and enjoy morning Love you guys ❤️
'D' should have been the correct answer on one of the questions. It would have been unexpected.
5:40 they said my name about 20 times and It’s hilarious 😂
Thank you guys for keeping us fans entertained for 5 days a week! Love you guys! Stay flipping awesome.
That gimmick at the end combined with Rhett's scream is probably the hardest I've ever laughed at you guys!
And that's what you call a Cincinnati mohawk
that golf cart at the end oh my god hahahahahahaha
Drinking game: take a shot with every word ending in "ected".
If Mike plays golf, that is him in the first video.
I watched the very end of this video at least three times 😂
Magickarp uses Splash...it's super effective!
10:11 HEY! a Brazilian vídeo, they saying: You have to enter "more" lol
Good morning everyone! I legit just woke up
That was such a fun episode, this would have been a good season ender. I can't wait to see what awesome video will end this season.
That Morgan guy was cute😍
The guy with the fish is Brazilian, his daughter was filming. She says in the beginning: "You gotta get in. Get in the water."
Then at the end she tells him: "Protect your face, Dad!" (great advice when you're being attacked by monstrous fish).
And the "Holulaaa" that Link imitates is "Segura!" which means "Hold on" (probably hold on to your life) hahahaha
Cincinnati got whole lot of problem lately i still like my hometown
I gotta say, I'd have the same exact reaction if the doors opened to Bill Nye.
Next time do the “to be continued “ compilation reaction
5:01 My Google Home did not understand the question...
Pleasantly surprised by the amount of Morgan Morgan appearance today. Oh boy oh boy everybody loves Morgan 😂
I did not expect this video
I love this video! Mo'gan mo'gan wink and the ending too
10:02.........”let’s not do that anymore”


Lmfao
omg when Reth said it's a gool map zoom video my google went "I don't have a google map zoom zoom video, lol"
Lil mama was twerkin seconds before meeting Mr Bill nye!!!!!!
This is like the spiritual successor to Head, Gut, or Groin?
Well that was unexpected.
MORE MORGAN WINKS!
I’m so in love with Link. There I’ve said it 🤷🏽‍♀️
That guy at the end was the most California person I've ever seen lol
I only got two wrong. Does that mean I passed?

Also, Good Mythical Morgan
I SCREAMED WHEN MORGAN WINKED AT TGE END AGAIN LMAO
you should invite billie eilish
I legit screamed at the end because that was so unexpected
Bill Nye got all them girls to turn around
Golf-cart @ end is hilarious ✋ 

High five on a ‘no food episode too ✋ 

Always my favorite
I got REJECTED when I became ERECTED..she said “That was UNEXPECTED...”
The way the bus turns is the first hint, giving it away.
Followed, of course, by the damn snake...
That first video was fake, slow it down.
Look! It’s me looking into the camera 


Get it?
Legend says Morgan's wink is more powerful than Thano's snap.
13:57 That was so r/unexpected
What a perfect ending video 🤣 Bravo
The Bill Nye video legit made me happy. Those reactions were priceless...
Links reaction to the last Morgan wink was great. 😉
You should do an unexpected gmm submissions game
10:56 Rapture occurs 
Comments:555
GMM must be the secret to being cool talented and good-looking. Everyone on the show just wow!
I am from Cincinnati, we are sorry too.
10:05 "Let's not do that anymore" hahaha probably a good idea
Those first two are CGI, I'm like....98% positive. Am I crazy?
I knew the cat vid and Bill Nye vid
New mama sheep baby sheep challenge???😂
That’s HILARIOUS!! One of my close friends is Bill Nye’s nephew so this cracked me up! 😂😂
Oh my gosh!!! As I was typing that at the end I saw Morgan and shouted, “Morgan!!!” And am now, if I wasn’t already a Morgan fan for life lol
Me: sitting up refreshing the page 
GMM: GMM INTRO THEME SONG
Bro everyone knows bill...
This was such a great episode!!
That ending tho, I really felt that 🤣
Hello from Perth Australia GMM
Bill Nye the mechanical engineer that plays an environmental scientist on tv.
Link: But his beanie stayed on!
Rhett: Yeah it did
The golf cart at the end was perfect! 🤣
Okay that golf cart at the end was priceless 😂
Bill Nye? Never heard of him 👋🏼
Could they get Bill Nye on GMM???  Possibly?? Thatd be amazing
Alternate ending : both Rhett and Link dies
I must say, this video I neglected, 
At first until an unexpected 
Thought popped in my distracted
Brain and I reacted. 

This will be fun.
Wow. I love how at the end of the video you guys get ran over by Winking Morgan, then after the WOM video, you guys are fine.
Will you get DEJECTED when I am EJECTED from the PROJECTED... moans a-smeckeckted
Best written episode you've had in a while
That ending was so hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a proud Roman citizen, I could have told you that just by seeing where he was going in the map XD
Where's Trent Alexander's corner kick??? - Liverpool vs Barcelona
Rhett: link you are on fire today!
Link: checks himself for fire
I believe that would actually be a Cleveland Mohawk. A steamy Cleveland Mohawk.
The first one looks like it was faked by someone who has no idea how to use after effects
Bill Nye the science guy BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL

😂
Is it me or does Rhett seem like he needs a vacation in this video?
The first two were pretty obvious visual effects...
This video had an unexpected hack for Android users and people with the Google home because link says "okay google"
That ending was perfection <3
1:41
Happer-kaclected!? 😂😂
Smosh is still a thing?
Its 6 am im SLEEPING I THOUGHT THE NOTIFICATION WAS MY MOM
this was the best gmm episode in recent memory
EVERYONE knows the science guy
Cincinnati mohawk 😂😂😅 I'm dyin!!
Did you guys land a Netflix show? Hint Hint
the person with the golf cart just kept going geez lol
I am so glad they included: "I'M A GIRAFFE!" into the title :)
I thought this was an old video when I saw the thumbnail 


DEJA VU
So, how is your life going ? 
Me:  0:59
I’ve only seen the bill nye one. Lol omg the golf cart
You should react to IT chapter 2 trailer with the guy who plays IT

That golf cart at the end was more unexpected than the original
Cincinnati representative here: we're just glad you've heard of us :)
Up all night working on an essay🥴 Good morning!!🤪
That was one of the best episodes ever!  Nicely done.
Morgan using both eyes is my mood in 2019.
Well, that was unexpected
That set up for the wink joke was glorious
Watching the unexpected from sub reddit lol some these videos 🤣
Morgan and that stranger 🖤 well well well...
Is it bad if i got them all right because i watch a lot of memes?
I wish I was the 1 Mil viewer ._.
I wasn't expecting you to be #15 on trending. I could've sworn you'd be #1
This episode was so unexpected at so many many moments had me going 😲
The golf cart towards the end was phenomenal.
11:05 classic Schrödinger's cat scenario
One time Bill Nye walked into my elevator jk
I request another round of catch the fish with grandad 🙌
A Cincinnati Mohawk!
I am taking this.
04:10

YOSHIKAGE KIRA WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
Rhett and Link say nothing happens in golf, but Tiger Woods just won his 2nd Masters!
The bill nye one got me shook
The dude in the water with the fish is brazilian. They were speaking Portuguese. 
Portuguese-speaking fans, where u at? 😛😆😀🤙
Best GMM ending in years!
Hahaha great just choose 
100 times b you get some right
nice to see Link browsing RHETT-it
Lol I spit up my toothpaste when I saw the golf cart trampling Rhett and Link. 🤣
Smeck-eck-ected
Words by link
Totally got me at the end, that was the best part of the video, that and Morgan winking at the end.
Cant wait for yoursoloud at 10:00
Why a Cincinnati now hawk of all places😂😂
Honest question guys: how does an improv show have a director?
Throwin Smosh a bone, heavy 😂😂
"It's just a circle" well sh*t... I have 2 snakes and I just ordered some new model kits today (they were Star Wars TIE fighters though) 🤓
I love how these professional entertainers can't identify CG and bad edits...
Link throwing up the sines
I thought you guys were talking about Morgan Freeman😂
Lets be real everyone’s real favorite is Rhett
Soundcloud rappers be like 1:08
Link was looking like Dana Carvey today
I need me a Morgan. 🤤🤤🤤💕
Why is it Link most of the time for these type of things
Morgan should be in more vids
Nobody:
Link: 1:13 paused
Had to watch it @0.25 😂
Today was a good episode. Cheers ✨
Ignoring the r/, this game is called DESU
That golf cart was epic 🤣😂🤣😂
"Haloolla." - Link Neal, 2019

Tiger Woods has entered the chat

From Temecula, CA. 👍
Rhett coming in strong with the dad jokes this morning
Will you get rejected
When you get corrected
On the things that you expected
In the vids that you’ve selected.
like the r/ reference
The game title reminds me of Swaggersouls' Eminem bit and now I'm happy
In regards to Link's shirt: 
I think he's looking for his pants...

Edit: Nvm... I thought that was a giant buut crack, but I saw his sleeve and figured out what I was looking at. Gimme a break. I just got home from work.
On the days I have to be up at 5am I'm glad I can watch at least one episode of GMM before work
This video made me feel so hepikicklected.
That's the country of my parents, Argentina!!
I just got the notification for this, but the date on the video is for 3 days ago???
They were speaking in Portuguese from Brazil!
The Fishs are in Brazil and she saids, "Segura"  what means "Hold On". Cheers from Brazil
Get Bill Nye on the show
1:11 to see Link summon the spirit of Garth, from Wayne's world.
How would them knowing who Bill Nye is be a twist, man?? I grew up on Bill Nye and I’m probably around their age. He’s a classic!
Remake the unicorn rap
Ok, but who is Stefano. 🔥
YOU GUYS NEED TO HAVE SHANE AND COURTNEY ON THE SHOW!!
I'm winking at the camera!?
Bill Nye for guest?

That ending was.... unexpected 😂😂
Morgan Wink™ merch
the internet prepared me for this, i got every one right lol
#gmm I love your videos
In the video at 10:11
The girl behind the camera is saying: “didn’t work, you are gonna have to get in the water”
And after Link guessed
“cover your face dad!” “CATCH ONE”
Rhett, this is Brazil man
Link- This is a baby sheep, number 15 i believe
Rhett- Number 15, Burger King foot burger, the last thing you want in your burger king burger
cadê os huehuebr? 😂
"Nothing ever happens" is actually a subreddit of its own.
"Holulaaa!" Haha trying to understand anything in another language is really hard, btw she said "Segura"(something like "hold on") in Brazilian portuguese
The ending of this episode has to be one of the top best 3 moments of GMM history.

In the pond video the woman says:  "You're gonna have to get in. Go. Get in." And at the end she says: " hold" ( could be translated as "hold it" or "hold on" )  It's Brazilian Portuguese.
The fish video is in Brazil. They say: "you have to go in deeper. Dad, cover your face"
We need to have Gus Johnson on the show
Everyone knows who Bill Nye is!

Me trying to be a professional dentist: "you got a Purdy mouth"
Fish video is in Brazil.
I'm new to GMM but I love link so much lmao
#14 on trending street
Thanks Link for opening up my Google Maps, did this happen to anyone else?
This is the first time i've ever watched in the morning but didnt get to finish it cause of school 😂
(6:50 is when I leave my house TFF)
I love Links shirt, so cute.
the fish video is from Brazil and some fish actually do this when startled 

I think
I knew that the one in Rome would be a derpy cat because that area has a cat sanctuary
😂😂 that last part made me jump
Jeez, y'all were in a mood today.
Oh, a mention of my hometown.... in reference to a poop mohawk.  Thanks Rhett.
Where I live it's 4:31 a.m
Morgan is the best!
Cincinnati Mohawk
Y’all went in on that try not to laugh lmao
Can we get Bill Nye to walk into GMM?
8:47 airport t A r m A C
Y’all need to get bill nye on the show that would be epic
cincinnati mohawk X'D
Idea for a Good Mythical Summer episode: Testing the best suitcases on the market
OMG I was laughing the whole time!!!! Like if u were too!
My name's Morgan and I MYSELF winked at the camera.  It just felt right
Oh my god can we see some more of Morgan
The second I saw that elevator I knew what was about to happen
"yes I does" 1:15
Spent too much on 9gag to correctly answer all of these
Morgan can wink for us any day.
Finally i get some Morgan
Every one of those girls on the elevator were once on the show of "Bill Nye The Science Guy". They grow up soo fast.
GMM is legit what I look forward to right when I get home after school! I love you guys so much! Thank you for everything y’all do!
Ooo Stephen 😍
Wtf just happened 😂
I’m hoping he gets hit by a golf cart 😫😫😫🤣🤣
The fish video is in Brazil! In the end she said "seguuuuuuura" and I laughed so hard when link said "haluuuuula"
Morgan is good looking lol
Welp... I’m certainly awake now!  Everything’s unexpected when it’s 5 AM and you can barely see or process information.
The gold cart at the end was amazing
This episode had that spark that they've been missing lately...
I declare may 15th to be morgan morgan day
Great..  now I'm always going to expect Bill Nye to walk onto the elevator and I will inevitably always be disappointed.
10:10 the woman was telling the man to get in the water, she was speaking portuguese ☺ it's a video from my country Brazil...
I can't believe you dissed the Queen City like that...
So many winks! What a treat.
As a Cincinnatian, you don't have to apologise. We get it...
Well hello Morgan and Stefano (sp?)....meowwww! wink wink
...The ending got me. xD
Well.done link... he never guesses right usually
This is such a chill episode ☺️
Wow! A Brazilian video on GMM LOOOOOL. The video with the guy in the water. This lake is called "pesqueira" and is common in rural areas in southern Brazil. This phenomenon happens when the lake is overloaded with fish. I'm a huge fan of your show. Kisses from the Rio Grande do Sul-Brazil
11:57 This is Brazil! 😂
As a Morgan, I did indeed just wink at my computer screen.
YOU DON'T SAY THE SLASH
I ended up here after you did something with Sorted food. I love it so I'm staying :D
He got jumped
this was a great episode
Half way in and I have seen all these clips. I need to put my phone away.
That “unexpected video” is a lie, because we know that either way there will be an “unexpected video” therefore making it an expected video.
Not one bit expected...js. Well played....
Bill Nye The Science Lie!
Morgan needs to wink more ;)
What was that ending
For that unexpected start they should have switch places :) :)
The guy in the pond with all those huge fishes, that's in Brazil
Noice 
Toit
The fish are Asian silver carp
Well Hello Stefano!
I missed the last three but I got the first ones
I would love to see Bill Nye on GMM
Packed full of unexpectedness!!!
I've seen every one of those clips before. I spend way too much time on reddit.
I got 4 right. Go me 🙏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 at the end!!!
Rhett and Link should have characters in an actual smash video, like an every blank every.
We all know think has seen the many golf cart hit and run videos.
links shirts are always so cool!!
Morgan, the real MVP
Who else misses old gmm...
4:51 “we have to get that” wth? 😂
i luv link’s shirt 🥰
Lol Cincinnati mohawk
I WANT LINKS SHIRT
wow they got to met a fake scientist.
When will D became a right answer
Post Malone
Morgan Whats up lol ?!
I watched the Try Not To Laugh video and then watched it again. It's great!
12:00 BRASIL CARALHO
💗 those 😉, Morgan .... EPIC 😆
That small pond had to be in Brazil because they were speaking Brazilian Portuguese.
Spoiler






That last clip he knew that they knew who he was 😉
I think I heard Bill Nye tell that story on the start talk podcast.
Link wearing online ceramics??
I got 4/6 not bad
Green screen of morgan winking please. so we as a community can put him winking everywhere!
After watching a first video I already thought “wow link is really handsome, and Rhett is just Gorgeous” and that they’re like 24/25, after some time i decided to go on Wikipedia and it was like “wow, over 40... yeah” you’re keeping yourself really good, I love you guys and the things you are doing ❤️ so creative, funny and distanced to yourself, waiting for the next video ☺️
You should've put an answer on D. Now that would've been unexpected.
BILL NYE THE RUSSIAN SPY!
The vídeo with the fishes was on brazil. SEEEGUUUUUURRRA!
the last uploads have been doozy
THE ENDING
Oh my god, the end got me. ❤️❤️❤️
Bring bill nye on the show!
Smosh still do videos? Haha I didn't even know
Good morning, mythically
The pond video is in Brazil
Uh.....WHERES THE PART 2 YOU FRUCKERS?!?!?!?!?!
I’m waiting for the day the answer will be D
Morgan! 😄
"I would get naked and press against him"
1:39 why am i soo immature🤣
13:57 R/UNEXPECTED
I got 4/7
The only reason worth getting up at 6am
Oh Morgan is a hottie!
morgan didnt even wink, he shut both eyes lmao
My name is Morgan. That was exciting
Can I just say at 10:04 link does a bit from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I am also watching nine nine on my tv while watching this...I’ve never been happier.
Is tightage a word???  No, it’s not.
i'm glad to say that the guy entering in the "fish pool" is from my country, Brazil!
10:02 and Rhett's "Let's not do that anymore" may be my favourite moment from any GMM I've seen.
I didn’t expect that ending! 😂😂😂
rhymezone.com? link should try rhymebrain.com - much better platform!
I live in Cincinnati. No offense taken 😂
That golf cart one is a meme and as soon as I saw it I kNEW
It's only a matter of time until "derpy" becomes a non-PC word that gets censored by the fun police.
It's only a matter of time until "derpy" becomes a non-PC word that gets censored by the fun police.
Where's the rest of the video where Bill Nye hooks up with the chicks Gonzo style?
The person said get more in
0:59 haha
I struggled to read all of links shirt ,for the first 6 minutes , until he put his hands behind his head just briefly! I probably would have missed the video had he not did that......
The end was funny and unexpected 😂
Oops the cat snarted
13:56 watch in 0.25 speed. You’re welcome
A derpy cat? How insensitive.
The video that starts at 10:10 is from Brazil, more specifically from the southern region.
Where did Link get his shirt?? Love it!
A Cincinnati Mohawk lmao
When they read “nothing it’s golf” my dog sighed lol
Morgan cute
IM A GIRAFFE
who else tried walking their hands on the table when they saw 4:00
I love link's logic
It's a special bad type of fish that we have in Michigan
Such an unexpected ending! Well done!
Rhett loved his job. I meant joke. Rhett loves both.
Cincinnati mohawk lmao
Joining the reddit gang :p
i love cats so much. they don't look like demons at all
Rhett said: 7🦷
Morgan is the real winner here
Wow what an episode. I swear you guys have gotten funnier.
Anyone else think they were talking about Morgan freeman.
I did not expect that to happen to be unexpected.
Morgan and Morgan, dont settle for less than you deserve
6:59 The new Wow Man?
Cincinnati Mohawk reminds me of the Cleveland Steamer.
A day full of Morgan Morgan winks is a good day indeed!
Link's facial expressions cause me pain
@8:38 apology not accepted.
They have to ler you over there...... Y'all kinda own them now
Morgan’s cute
10:03 I can already see a youresoloud video about that coming up
This was a good one
Wo-hoo! Brazilian fishes!!!
I know I promised I wasn't going too , ............and relations are based on trust
the fish thing was in Brazil
Come to London Ontario Canada!!
I'm from Cincinnati.
Morgan 😍
Let link host a game please!!! :)
Dibs on Morgan.
Rhymezone is frickin useful
10:12  I knew it happened in Brazil even before hearing the woman speaking Portuguese, it's the type of thing that would definitely happen where I live
How sad is it that I knew every one of these.
It's good to be Bill Nye...
6:41 "seven teeth take"  lol
I just realized , Rhett is just like me , he just wants to stuff his face with food .
Btw if u don’t know they own Smosh and they share a studio
I like these style episodes the most
Wo else thought he was talking about Morgan Freeman?
I'm from Cincinnati and I'm not even mad.
So it's basically r/unexpected
I totally expected that ending... :P
Link:explains the vid
Rhett:let’s talk about that
Love your channel!!!!!
The video in the pond is brazilian, can't tell you what th happened thought!
Remember when smash was run by smosh
3 Morgan Morgan winks and Davin running Rhett and Link down in a golf cart? The most unexpected video.
1:12 Dana Carvey in Waynes World
omg, I felt the same way. I wanted him to get run over by a golf cart, and then I instantly felt bad when he got run over by a golf cart. That looked awful!
Half these are fake
everybody search in youtube rhetts rages about his chair
My teacher showed my class  the google maps cat video
winks at camera
loving the silly twists lol
Fart and sneeze... A snart?
Bill Nye the science guy oh man I was was watching  his show on Netflix his old show man I would have asked for a autograph.
Good morning. My lower back hurts
Wasn’t the bill nye video already on one of these episodes?
8:25 Who else checked Urban Dictionary for "Cincinnati Mohawk"?
damn why u gotta do us cincinnati people like that
So how does Link enter streetview?
I watched the smosh video and you guys were hilarious!
I think those jumping fish are silver carp. They are a very dangerous invasive species..
I saw the Smosh vid is was funny
What if the unexpected video is that there is no video
Ummm. Anyone else blown away by Morgan? No? Just me? Okay...lol
Didn’t they just buy SMOSH or something?
13:57, well I'll admit that I was not expecting that.
Who is Bill Nye?
Good ole Morgan and his winks 😉
When they got ran over by the golf cart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Morgan is not Chase.  I feel like we need more Chase
Morganception
They should play reddit 50/50
Will it doughnut anyone
I have to travel for an hour to work reddit makes it feel like 15 mins
I like Morgan.
This reminds me of Head Gut or Groin
Was that a tech n9ne reference at 2:49
Should be called r/CGI Unexpected
The cat looked like it got ran over by the golf cart!
Is link getting stranger? 🙃
Suggasaeng  as
1:14 Garth
The fish video is in Brasil.
Morgan Morgan Morgan Morgan Morgan Morgan
10 /10
The dozens fish is a Brazilian video
That cat got me.
Expect the unexpected
What's really funny is that golf cart thing at the end looked like something that would have been on the show Bill Nye the Science Guy. XD
I'M A GIRAFFE
The google maps picture of the cat is actually taken in an ancient square in Rome, where some ancient roman remains have been transformed into a park for "wild" cats!
Comment number 1000
Comment number 1000
10:01 Loophole
smosh has been a word i haven't heard in centuries
Bring back Anthony

beautiful episode
Well that’s a twist
13:56 (O_O)
Morgan Winks.
Just woke up, Yay
LOL the laufg to serious face'
morning morning morning link and rhetticle
How you erected a game?
Bill Nye has entered the chat
Smahkekadid

I only got two wrong :D
Smosh is sooooo 2007.
Hi your m9
Golf cart hit was fake, duh
love reddit & I love R&L
Can you do will it mash potato with Billie eilish
My 16th birthday is on Monday! Wish me happy birthday
Link had previously seen the video with Bill Nye already. That's how he got the answer so fast. lol
I would love it if some of the mythical crew appeared as extras in some Smosh videos
OKAY GOOGLE zoning in
expect the unexpected
4:37 booooo
13:30 BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
Im so early lol
As a Mythical Beast in Cincinnati, I forgive you, Rhett (8:36).
IMMA GIRAFFE
Morgan is hot!  lol :)
I thought they wear bras
Who bill nye
asian carp😟
Love this
I need links shirt
Morgan is not Chase. We want Chase!
Does Morgan have a license to drive a golf cart?
0:47 I AM A GIRAFF
It's so funny to see dads impressed by fake videos lol
Morgan gave me the biggest laugh of the whole show at the end there!!!!!!!!     Slam Dunk Guy!!!!
That pond video was at Brazil, the woman was basically saying for the man to go deeper in the pond, and after that to be careful
Asian jumping carp we have some in Mississippi
I love that last clip. Because, like Rhett said, people often stereotype girls like that as shallow or not particularly intellectual, but seeing how excited they were to see Bill Nye was so sweet. I'm definitely overthinking it, but it's such a tender reminder of how humans are complex and it's unfair to pass judgements on people quickly.
That should have said it looks like a California mohawk instead of a Cincinnati
You guys own smosh right
Link you made my google assistant search, when you said that at 5:00 mark lol
I'm not gonna lie the golf cart at the was unexpected.
Rhett “Cincinnati Mohawk” Mclaughlin
why is link always playing the game.
Bill smashed
The fish are silver carp, they are taking over waterways and they jump when disturbed.
I got 5/7 right
😂😂😂😂 that golf cart. I’m dying 😂😂
I hope you find what you are looking for
Who is watching in 2019 may 15?
The fish video is in Brazil.
GMM having a director was completely unexpected! I thought it was all improv. 😮
Still can't believe GMM bought Smosh.
Morgan is the real star of GMM
The only people that really deserve to be on trending
Haha my dad has an intricate train model and two snakes.
They should do a video where they guess how expired a food is.
I love this game
Golf one was fake af
I feel neglected.
The fish are carp
Omg Bill Nye🤩
They really missed a chance to crack a joke about the movie speed
Morgan is quite attractive
I miss kevin
Ha ha ha that was funny at the end
The muffled scream at 13:57
Rhett seems like a guy who owns a pet beaver y’know sending me lumberjack vibes with the beard
And we never seen them again after the golf cart ran them down...  Untill tomorrow
Ugh! I love you guys! 💗
The golf cart 😂😂😂😂
When you fart and sneeze at the same time your body is taking a SCREENSHOT!
Morgan Morgan!!!!!!!!!
That outtro thou
at first i thought links shirt just said “i hope you find what you are” and i was like... wow, that’s deep...
Please do more will it’s! It’s been a while....
The wink didn’t go “ding” and I was confused
baby sheep trips face
I live in Cincinnati.  You don't come here on tour, then you make a bad joke. Well! I never! Seriously, I never....
That game was pretty unexpected.
5:08 i was there today!
Asian Carp, I’m guessing that a river flooded and they ended up in that little pond.
I love Rhettit and all the fun Links
I feel like Rhett and Link would be the type of people who would willingly get ran over by a golf cart for entertainment reasons.
13:58 UNEXPECTED
That video with all the fish is from Brazil, in the end the girl says "SEGURAAA" wich rouglhy translates to "HOLD YOUR PANTS". And as a brazilian myself I have no idea of whats going on in that video
Nar its a cis
Awesome ❤️❤️❤️
watching GMM on an actual morning
I’m so glad you guys saved smosh
well you heard it here folks. if you were a beanie and headphones then link really doesn't like you.
9:54 dj Rett
What no snakes on a plane joke?
Well this episode was unexpected! But I am not dejected. Instead I am astonished.
A PUNishment
These are some of my favorite episodes.
Morgan and Morgan, Morgan and Morgan, morgan and Morgan, Morgan and Morgan Morgan and Morgan Morgan Morgan and Morgan
Smosh still exists?
1:12 WAYNES WORLD
Whooppee cushion yass!!!
Rhett, this is quite possibly your best punny and funny video ever.
I need links shirt, anyone have a link for it?
Haha, nice surprise ending.
Please
Ha ha ha this is kinda funny but on Canada day can you do the game is he/she Canadian
you guys need to make more vids related to subreddits somehow. reddit and youtube is on i do 😂
The fish are called Arapaima, and they have many many farms of them over there
Guys please get Bill Nye on the show!!!!!!
That's awesome my name is Morgan keep up the good work love you guys
Fish are Asian carp.
4:53 gaaayyy
10:02
3:54 that what she said
I wish I knew where Link’s shirt was from!
make a rap battle again guys they are so damn cool
If they were ever to take the ability to forward threw videos away, I'd never watch this show again
I´ve seen all of them prior to this video... I got to quit 9gag
My favourite type of videos!!
Can y'all come to Seattle 😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💓🙏💓🙏💓💓
Oh my god all those Asian Carp, they used to jump for hours !!
The pond video is in Brazil (yes, we have ponds full of fish in some places). The girl says "you need to go deeper, dad". In the end she says "SEGURA", which means "hold on" or "hang in there".
MORGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What happened to life lines?
i only knew what would happen on that second to last one bc the person was saying "You gotta go deeper!" so it didnt make sense to be either a snorkler or a sinkhole (this is in brazil btw!)
the one with the fish happenned in Brazil hahaha
As a representative of Cincinnati, I speak for all of us when I say,  meh, that's cool. It's the least insulting thing someone will say about us this morning. Now let's go put chilli on spaghetti
Bet you didn’t expect this comment to end like this двоетныщм
love your videos
Morgan is hot not gonna lie
this was a great episode...that's all.
Do the teeth on your laptop say "PARTY"?
Letting you guys know, these dudes although just doing a morning show, have an outstanding networth of 20,000,000 USD combined 😨😨😨😨
That is not a costume its 3D
When is someone going to do a "what happens next" based on GMM clips??? or has that already happened?
#RhettandLink, idk if anyone has said this but i like your updated theme song, it is really catchy.
What would really have been unexpected is if the answer to any of these had been D.
If Link would just go with his gut instinct he would win 78.987% more of GMM’s games.

If Link would just go with his gut instinct he would win 78.987% more of GMM’s games.
The video with the fish is in Brazil. The guy's daughter is filming, and she's encouraging the guy to go deeper into the pond. Right before the fish start jumping, the girl tells her dad to cover his face. About the fish... I have no clue as well. And even though I'm Brazilian, I also have no clue on what the girl said at the end.
That golf cart though
That golf cart though
the golf cart at the end was great!!  that was so funny, you guys do too much😭😭
7:19 What happened here?.. o_0
first clip is fake......
spanish inquisition.
oh my
I'm sick and I just woke up because I couldn't stop coughing. So now (for me) I can watch this video that was uploaded at 5:00Am . I also have already watched the smosh video and it's very funny.
have they ever played geoguessr? if not they should
Ok lol
Number 9 on trending
Dammit... first Rhett says nasty spaghetti sauce tastes like Indianapolis while I was living in Indianapolis. Now, the Cincinnati mohawk?! Come on man!
The fish one is in Brazil for sure. My cousin has a bunch of these ponds on his farms on the countryside.
To disappoint ya'll, the cat on maps isnt there. its fake
morgan looks like jhonnny depp a little bit.
My man bill nye
both sheep were marked 15 cause they belonged to the same shepherd. They let their herds interbreed
Fully expected by sisters to be on here
I'm always SO excited when Morgan pops up because I KNOW there are new Mythical Beasts who've never seen him before -- I'm imagining their amazement at how they got Morgan Morgan, famous actor, on GMM for a cameo.
Those fish would be good to eat
Can't believe they got rid of the photo of that hot blond, Kelly wallkeisha
All what I got from the comments is that me in Europe wake up at the same time as people in North America..
I really hope Morgan popping up in videos and winking becomes another running gag like the Sprite can.
What a w h o l e s o m e shirt Linkypoo
10:00
OMG!!!
You guys are liars lol why can't ya release this episode at 8 instead Haha
First
esse vídeo dos peixes é mt bom uhsuahsaushaush
The video of the big fish jumping is in Brazil but... Same! I don’t have any idea of what is happening there
Hey
Flying karps
What is Link's shirt
Early
Those are carp. They jump when disturbed
Wait is Smosh still a thing
The 15 on both sheep are there to tell which mother they have
What time do u make these videos
Bill Nye :D!
Wooo morgan
I love y’all
They bought Smosh?
I think it should be a requirement for guests to know who Rhett and link are! ( This comes from some of your collab videos) someone school them before they come on the show so they are not staring at you guys with an odd look on their faces!
I'm from Cincinnati and can confirm that a "Cincinnati mohawk" is not a thing...
Do a will it lasagna
Has anyone else noticed that lately it's always Rhett as the host?
Anyone else able to guess all of them because they've seen the videos before? Not just me right
The innuendoes are a little much like it’s uncomfortable
I can’t say I disagree
Asian Carp invasive species in the US but the do that.
Unexpected
Anyone who is anyone knows who Bill Nye is.
I live in Australia so for me it’s GMN (good mythical night)
If I expect an unexpected video, is it unexpected?
Is it still an unexpected video when we know Rhett is making a unexpected video?
they should play the get the D game again, it’s super funny. i think Will would be really funny in it
I love r/Unexpected!
CHARLEY CHARLEY X MORGAN MORGAN
lol
I feel like link is so behind in the times but at the same time in . The . Time??????
oo morgan is cute
When he got run over whilst playing golf, the guy went flat as a pancake. Just like in cartoons.
Hey hey
Something unexpected while watching this video!: When Link said "ok, Google maps zooming in", my phone flipped over to the Google search bar and started typing in "maps zooming in"
Who saw that video about the chair
The fish video is in Brazil, they were saying "get in the water" then the fishes start to jump the lady tells her dad to protect his face lol and she said "segura" meaning hold on not "Holoolah", Link.
aaauUUAAUUauUAUAaaaAUAAUUuhHHH -Rhett May 15th 2019.
10251th view
So between this episode and having just rewatched "Finland Doesn't Exist" are Rhett and Link the Rick and Morty of the Internet? Maybe even world?
13:57
I can't be the only one who wanted to see the choreographed dance by the plane workers
Im aging too guys its okay
hi 744
Omg links tshirt.... What is that???
Smosh is still a thing?
8:07
you guys shouldn't work with smosh. dislike probaby the first
That ending was amazing y'all never don't amaze me please don't stop being ur mythical best love y'all to pieces ❤️
Mhmm
If you expect the unexpected then can it really still be called unexpected ?
The fish video is from Brazil
Those are asian carp. They leap as defense
It is not called a tarmac
Damn I’ve been on the internet too much, I have seen too much of these.
I thought smosh was not going to be a thing anymore.
Smekekeed
Enhance... Enhance... Enhance
I need link’s shirt. does anyone know where I can get it???
who is here after watching the smosh video
The fish videos was in Brazil, and the woman was worry about her father’s face
2:43
Hi
Link there is no such thing as a tarmac. It’s a made up term. Taxiway is the correct word.
The guy in the water video is from brasil and in the beginning she said “you have to enter more” ( direct translation). And in the end she say “hold it”
In the video of the guy in the water, they were saying "get in a little bit depper"
Chillin in the comments because I don’t want to see sheep poop
Vat 19 vat 19 vat 19 eat it or wear it
Y’all are my idols I have a vid of me crying to getting tickets to your tour for my bday on my channel but yeah. Love y’all to bits.
iMAGIRAFfe
where did the wheel land......
The one with the fish is "fishy".  Those fish were way too big and there were too many of them to be in the small pond.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
A CINCINNATI MOHAWK?! WHAT YOU GOT AGAINST CINCY? ILL FIGHT YOU RHETT!
they should do the back words word challenge, if they hadn’t already done it
Hello
Morgan, Morgan and Morgan and Morgan , Morgan and Morgan and Morgan, winks and Morgan
Um. Hi Morgan😍😍🤤
When is the next where in the world do these international food come from dart game?
Comment
Imma giraffe
The guy in the pond is brazilian and what they're saying is "you'll have to go underwater" and after the unexpected thing happens (spoiler alert), the woman says "hold them"
The ewe and her lambs have numbers on them to help the rancher to tell which lambs go with a mama. Because mother sheep won't help a lose or motherless lamb.
The video of the fish is in Brazil, and the fish are tilapia and these are raised in pools like that. - El video de los pescados, es en brasil, y los peces son tilapias y estas se crian en piletas como esa.
bring candice patton back or someone else from the arrow verse please because of all the finales that had happen and arrow ending
Hmm
Anyone else see, “and they all shrek”
Just so link can know the number on the ear tag of the lamb if for the day of the month that were born. Not their name.
Whoa
Great episode without food!! Been missing these kinds of episodes
BILL
U know sheets about to go crazy when they say they went to reddit
Hi
Golf cart video was clearly fake.
The video of the pond with the fish is in Brazil.
The fish one is from Brazil, they were speaking portuguese. First the girl says to her dad that he must go into the water, then she said "HOOOOOLD"
how?
10:03
Please have Smosh on!!! Your Try not to Laugh with them was HILARIOUS
What's the story behind Morgan and winking?
I'M A GIFFRAF
:(
I expect a Good Mythical CSI soon
lol
Does anyone have a link to the video of the guy with the jumping fish as posted on reddit?
🧀💰🧀💰🧀💰🧀💰🧀😔
the reason the lambs have the number 15 is that it marking who there mother is so the ewe identifying number on her ear tag is a 15
I’m one early mythical beast, early beast gets the worm??
You guys should do the reddit 50-50 challenge
Laughing at someone being hit by a golf cart is not cool, guys. It is VERY dangerous and should not be joked about.
12:06 This video is probably filmed in Brazil first his daughter says: "You gonna have to go deeper" Then she says: "Watch your Head dad" and the last word she yells is "seguraaaaaa" which means "hold on"
Smekekete
You know you use reddit too much when you knew all of these videos
Lol
smekeky
What happens next? I push 👍
They were surprised those girls knew who bill nye was, who doesnt know who bill nye is
Did anyone else realize that the sheep video has been used before?
I'm sure it's already been said somewhere in the comments, but those fish are Asian Carp. They're a real problem as an invasive species in American waterways.
Why would yall go on Smosh?
The pond video is probably somewhere here in Brazil. No one asked, but here is the rough translation:
10:15 Vai ter que entrar mais, entra mais. - "You need to go farther in. "
11:38 - Ai ai ai, protege a cara, pai. - "Protect your face, father."
11:47 - SEGURA! - "Hold on!"
Why is link Garth from Wayne’s world ......
Lol
A guy is on a roof. What will happen next?


A: He jumps
B. He floats on air
C: A UFO abducts him
Anyone already seen the Bill Nye and Cat one multiple times, and got the answer right?
I actualy just watched the try not to laugh challenge before starting this one
I shrieked at 6:00 am because of the ending😭 now that was unexpected😂
Expect the R/UNEXPECTED!!!
Daje c’è il gatto di Torre Argentina!!
do a will it guacamole
The 6th video is in Brazil. That's what's happening lol
I didn't expect the golf cart.
In the USA and just going to sleep.
This is the 3rd time "Lufthansa" has come up in the last 30 hours... I listened to a Bill Burr podcast where he couldn't pronounce it, which made me want to watch Goodfellas but instead read an article about the heist, and now this.
I'm from Cincinnati!!!!
They didn't do something unexpected of their own in this episode.
So when are you guys having Bill Nye on?
I should be studying for my last final test, but then I saw that GMM was on.
I live in Cincinnati and have all my life. Am I missing something with the Cincinnati Mohawk joke? Is it a reference to the defunct hockey team? Either way Rhett, Cincinnati forgives and loves you haha
Comment 1000
smegeked
Morgan was never interviewed and hired. He just walked in one day, winked, and started working.
The fish video is here in Brazil lol The woman was telling her dad to cover his face so he doesn't get hit by the fish (Also, I've seen that kind of thing happening once. It's really weird).
Link making up words is the best part my day so far, I've only been awake for 10min but I stand by what I said
I luv watching your vids
The end gave me freaking heart attack
Comments: I just woke up!
Me: I was about to go to sleep but ok
Holy heck I’m early.

Great content as always.
Oh my goodness! I befriended that cat when i was in Rome last summer! 😂
Well this was unexpected 🙌🏼😮
I DID NOT EXPECT THIS VIDEO WTF
I never sleep because I cannot count higher than 15.
Australian snacks? Why not.
Love the golf cart at the end!!!!
It's a walking peace sign
I was frickin early
You know what time it i-AAAAAAWWSHHHHHHHHHHDVGF
That golf clips going straight to Tom segura
So the editors are aware that they may have just introduced the first of a serious of random outros for Rhett and Link to perform at the end of some GMMs, right...? Just sayin'
Call Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan & Morgan .
“I’d have to get naked and press into him”
Why have opinions on fake videos that clearly are CGI...and I'm not referring to the snake video either..
  do they make these fake videos just for this fake BS YouTube fantasy world..  and how can this video be trending at 10? This is a true dumbing down of society
The golf cart vid is clearly fake.
Morgan can wink at me anytime
Flashback to when I would wake up early for work and these guys were all I got
Just when I made myself a cup of coffee, you guys truly made my morning even better :)
rhett’s face 🤣🤣 00:52
Ay, Early!! perfect timing!
It’s so early in the morning at my house
Have a good day y'all
Its 3am for me
link's shirt is so wholesome i want it
Oh yeah I remember smosh, lan and uh... lan and... what, what was his name? It was lan and adria...no... adri something. NO WAIT! Anthony! That's what it was! It was Lan and Anthony, yeah I remember now, what are they doing these days? It's been ages since I watched a smosh video, they did that pokemon song, remember? A classic viral video in Youtube's history. good times, good times.
620th like
Everywhere I look there's a Reddit video, Reddit is taking over, the end draws near
Cool
I’m not surprised those girls knew him, who didn’t go to public school in the US and watch bill at some point? I bet most people know his theme song by heart and it’s now stuck in your head.
The really unexpected part about the end of the video is that Daven was driving from Rhett's side, but earlier, he was on Link's side of the studio!
Spoiler alert: The ven diagram of women who wear swimsuits and like science is also probably a circle.
Do Rhett and Link are Reddit YouTubers now?
Love bill nye!
I am so, so happy I didn’t read the comments first before I saw the end of the video. I haven’t laughed that hard in a while.
Link directing the director! What’s the world come to?
Just saw the try not to laugh at smosh and got a notification just as I finished it!!
This is Survivor, expect the unexpected
i am confident that I have seen all of these
TASTE TEST PUERTO RICAN FOOD!!!!

One time D needs to be the answer just to trick Link
I’m a lot earlier than normal... by a couple hours... so GOOD MYTHICAL MORNING EVERYONE!
I think it’s really cool that you guys bought smosh when they were in a tricky spot and it was really cool for you to be in one of their videos.
Can you guys please come to Boston for the Tour of Mythicality? :)
Link's face at 2:48. He was so shocked and appalled!
I watched the SMOSH video and I couldn’t stop laughing the whole time..I laughed so much my whole face hurt for another hour 😂😂😂 “Smella that!”
Early here because, UNEXPECTED!

Honesty i don't know what to expect anymore, i dont even expect this comment to get seen.
GMM in 2054: "Can It Quantum Compute? (Space Bacteria Edition)"
No one likes me.
Tell the truth  you guys  own smosh
Reddit deddit dedemption 2
Kind of shady that you're advertising Smosh even though it's Channel you own and you didn't mention that in the video.
Maynard let us record a song at the tool concert last night and it was on YouTube almost as soon as it was over.
That wheel intro was the best! So many unexpected things in this video AND still the one to be posted on instagram. Today is a good day 😁
Gays
I already know this is gonna be good so in advance great video.
LINK i love your shirt!!
Oh this will be a good one 🤣
does anyone remember amazinglife247's expect the unexpected series?
I'm so early if I was a women I wouldn't be pregnant.
They seriously thought that hand was real?! At least Link did 😂🤣
First  in comment and 2  viewer. This my second time being this early just press on my comment it's early than anyone's and I woke up to go to the bathroom
2 views and 37 likes
Omg when that Smosh Pit video was posted I got the notification in the middle of class and I freaked out so I ran and told my friend. She freaked out too. The video was amazing.
Generation of narcissists? Wrong. How dare you. I'm perfect.
GMM: uses r/Unexpected to mank unexpected video format.

"Modern problems require modern solutions"
I live in Cincinnati don't worry u are 100 percent correct lmao
Do this for another video
WILL IT... 
CHAIR?
All of the Morgan winking was absolutely amazing 
He also seems to only ever wear one shirt
I seen you on smosh. Link went all cotton candy randy and Rhett had a sexy little red thing on! Ohhh my ☺😂
When they kept saying “Morgan” in a southern accent it just made me think of Arthur Morgan and now I’m sad :(
Bill Nye is an actor not a scientist. The belief in the Rapture was installed over 80 years ago by the Jesuits. The Earth is flat.
I thought it was actually morgan freeman at first.
An unexpected Morgan wink was detected
Good mythical morning mythical beasts
can we please stop with the innuendos it's getting kind of old guys, to the point where it ain't even funny anymore
I wonder if people know about this but, Rhett and Link own Smosh now.
4 haters have disliked this video for no reason without watching it.
@rhett so girls who wear bathing suits and party can't also like science?... Okay.
Early squad! Good morning y'all!
The lambs prob have 15 wks before they're slaughtered for your plate. Stop eating them ffs

See what happens when we leave each other alone for a day!! https://www.instagram.com/tv/Bxc-sYFgTQU/?hl=en
The choice descriptions are getting more and more graphic
6:53 Link just feeding Rhett strawberries with no context is the kinda friendship I want.
Please do Will It Paint?. I would love to see foods blended up to become similar to paint and maybe even have Rhett and Link paint a picture using them too (and possibly eat the painting as well 😂)
So excited for the Saturday shows with Josh!

"Someone you admire is watching from afar" - me, thinking of our fellow mythical beast Post Molone.
Ok whoever wrote this episodes A and B choices is looking to get an R rating on GMM 😂

Link struggling with the fortune cookies had me in  tears. Ya'll need help

I haven’t watched GMM in about a year, and them randomly feeding each other is. A new development. 
Very cute.

Ah summer, where the base temp is 80F in Missouri🙄
10:00 - 10:03 we’re watching from afar
Uploaded on my Birthday
Love the glasses and strawberries routine 😂😂 fave
You guys should do a time lapse of the shelf
LMAO!!! Them feeding each other had me crackin' up! 😂
Lil Windex should have been featured for this episode 😭😂
"Alka-Seltzer...not a sponsor!" *thinks of the Great American Road Trip.* 😂
Link said it was may 17th 2019, when this video was uploaded on may 14th 2019.
Me: Staying up until 5 am

GMM: [insert GMM theme]
10:48 projared right now
"I have a lot of questions I'll follow up in my own time." 
Me in my group of friends that makes lots of references
So no one’s going to talk about Link randomly feeding Rhett strawberries?

Mkey.
i love that the strawberries are a thing now lol🤧
Windex + lamb brain = crack.

Who knew?

😂
Absolutely no one- 
Link- 🤲🍓 👄 (Rhett’s mouth)
What happens when you leave gummy bears In Windex?


Me: first of all, Levi is disappointed.
Second of all the gummy is still edible according to my bff😂
love the subtle passive aggression.  you guys are like an old married couple.
When you Already know from the start that At the End link will be like - "So that's Where those've been" 🤗😋
Who else only watches half of the video then leave
Next: 
Putting things in links glasses for a month
“It basically cleaned up this lamb’s thoughts” 😂😂🤣🤣
1:16 That's not family friendly.
3:49 One of the Gummy Bears landed in Rhetts Shirt Pocket
this is how you make crack? Who knew?
well I would assume crackheads knew.
I'm loving this slow corruption of Link.lol
FYI
groutdaddy.biz is an actual website with a picture of link cleaning his floors
But you should leave things in energy drink (monster preferred)
I just love this whole feeding each other routine. So sweet! 100% bromance.
I strongly suggest everyone watching this video searches groutdaddy.biz 


You won't be dissapointed.
Once again link needs to touch all food
Everytime he feeds him a strawberry they get really serious lol
MY QUESTION IS WERE IN THE WORLD DO THEY GET THERE BRAINS FROM
Rhett: Bites into Slim Jim
Link: “That was in Windex!” Very clearly a joke

Me: PANIC MAYBE IT IS THE FINALE


Edit: Rip I said beef jerky ;-;
ACTUALLY WENT to groutdaddy.biz and was pleasantly suprised
Windex was created to keep people from streaking LOL
They should rename the shelf "The Shelf of Abandonment" 😂
Scientist guys yip yip
"Wedding bells are in a close friends future" I'm going to my cousin's wedding this weekend :D
Good Mythical summer starts on my birthday...June 3rd😄❤
Leaving thing in _____ is my favourite series!

Wish u guys a wonderful Mythical Summer.
Greetings from germany
(groovy electrical music)
Rhett saying that sausage looked like those knee surgeries that's very accurate lmaoo💀🤨
“Windex is not made for drinking”
Me: Wanna bet

This segment is so interesting, and I love the descriptions!
The moment they turned the Slim Jim over and said oh my god felt totally accurate with my eyes
Looked up groutdaddy.biz...was NOT disappointed.

I guess you could say they brain-washed it
No one else realize that he said may 17th 2019 when may 17th hasn't even happened yet?
The strawberry gag gets me every time lol
Always say "in bed" after reading fortune cookies. It'll make you work for the fortune.
The scream after every new thing makes me so happy
I love how link suddenly started feeding strawberries to rhett. that was real sweet 🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓
when link realized it wasn't a dream come true
1:15 Link said it again and I just love how Rhett is trying to suppress his laughter 😂
Do y'all play guitar or something??

By the way groutdaddy.biz is a real website. It has Link my favorite one cleaning his floor with a tooth brush and toothpaste. He's also smiling with his mouth open , P.S. the toothpaste might be soup but I think it's toothpaste, that's Link being Link
Who else misses the old intro?? 😭
"Picture that and put it on a greeting card!"😂😂😂😂
We're watching from afar! They must admire us!

Love the fact that they actually got groutdaddy.biz for the joke at the beginning.

The random and unmentioned  feeding each other food made me uncomfortable.. lmao

"00:23-00:25" Rhett is me lowkey. Move them brows
Rhett, Link & Crew, thank you for season 15. Have a Merry Mythical Summer everyone! ✌🏼❤️

***Will it Soda Stream***
Do a Will it shaving cream!! It would be so funny! 😂❤
You should do vinegar, olive oil, or borax
No cap the only good thing on the trending page consistently
Oh look, another GMM video trending. Weird how this is the only channel that has every video in the trending tab. 🤔
According to YouTube this isn’t possible though. 🤣 
Maybe they should just make a GMM specific tab right next to the trending tab. 
What a joke.
Thankful they're not eating it.  
Finally.
1) Its 8pm in Australia. 
2) We're going in to Winter for Good Mythical Summer.

I should remember not to eat before watching this type of video
Aah, soaking things in the forbidden punch

Groutdaddy.biz was just as good as i was hoping it would be.
I’ve been watching GMM since yall’s first episode, they make me happy when I get really sad, I love your guys channel so much
I watched this while eating my lunch. That was a mistake.
I forgot how much I needed them in my life
In 2035....ya'll heard it here FIRST. 👀🙌🏼
Is no one gonna talk about the random strawberry feeding happening😂😂
You should leave things in vinegar for a month
Link: I was not aiming for your mouth
Rhett: Well thats not enjoyable
Link: Its more of a shower situation
Did you ever do a "we do a TEST To see which of these experimental remedies get rid of garlic BREATH" I'm sure they'll be tough to neutralize
Does anyone else let GMM videos build up so you can binge them? I'm here binging now😂
this is my first comment ever!! hi everyone :)
5:23 : THANOS
Link struggling to eat the fortune cookie is just too funny! Just watch watching his  eyebrows wriggle is hilarious!!
But fr why was Rhett looking like that 5:29 😂
Went to groutdaddy.biz... I feel weird...
make sure you all actually go to groutdaddy.biz lol
11:48 R&L: "New study shows that injecting your brain with Windex makes you smarter" 
"Who discovered it?"
"These 2 guys, GMM did it"
Me: ...Umm, no. It was Dahmer, he did it!
i love how u guys just randomly feed eachother
Me and the boys drinking the slurp juice we found under the sink
“like” if you went back to see if he was wearing his glasses or not😂
I did the research for the rest of the Mythical Beasts, and yes,  GroutDaddy dot biz is legit. Also,  Good Mythical Morning, World!
You should do an energy drink version.
Hrmm, try "Stay stained and turn green"... :P
Leaving a lamb brain in Windex for a month comes with a crazy surprise.
Rhett: “This is how you make crack?”
Lets see what happens if we leave the two of you in sodium hydroxide for a month.
Link casually feeding Rhett strawberries 🍓, and Rhett feeding Link fortune cookies 🥠 is the cutest and sweetest thing ever!
Lol 
Btw
#MJInnocent
8:30 it's pronounced  (fee- eddy) easy way to remember is there is  guy name eddy who owes someone. A fee
Nice touch on the R&L score square with two colours!
oh my god go to 12:37 and just loop links face saying is it crack? lmao best 5 minutes of my life
Windex always reminds me of My big fat Greek wedding 😂
i think you should introduce some games from earlier seasons back again. i think they are pretty funny but are forgotten
These a and b's had me on the floor
I just wanted to hi, welcome to headspace
Where the mommies at?
Rhett and Link: Is it crack? 

Me: Crack cobrain!
5:40 a wine stained pair of underwear is a pretty good summary of Dionysus from Greek Mythology
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE STRAWBERRY 7:35
The A & B options made this so awkward to watch that I have been trying for 48h now...
Leave things in pickle juice for a month
Have they tried leaving things in vinegar? They should if they haven't
Lil Windex is proud of you!
Do paint or lotion next.
You should leave stuff in eggnog a month before Christmas
3:20

Omg Links reaction to option B with the undies 😂😂😂. "I have a lot of followup questions that I will answer on my own time" 😂 good luck man. You wont ever wanna eat chocolate again

The word is UNFAZED not UNPHASED
Things left in salt? Or sugar?? Lime powder??? An ant colony???? The naughty corner????? Those are my suggestions.
Bring back 10 feet tall please I really loved that series and I would really like to see more.
Mythical beast if you are? Like this comment 👍
This Friday May 17, 2019 is my birthday 🎂🎂
I don’t think the fortune cookies had anything to do with the fortunes being fine. Windex just doesn’t dissolve paper.
Noted...To keep link quite feed him fortune cookies!!!!!!!
3:25 *me pausing between sips of my third bottle of windex
Leave things in motor oil!
Please stay family friendly 😉 watching this show is a fun thing I do with my little ones

Ever since I got a new job I’m up early enough to make gmm the first thing I watch in the morning! Nothing is better
Rick & Morty season 4 November 2019!
May I ask why you 2 grown men are feeding eachother?

I am SO stoked for the Mythical Chef Josh show omg
You heard Rhett 2035 we will be able to see a sheep’s life 😂😂
Also is it just me or does link always have his glasses on before the skit 13:38😂😂
June 3rd is my birthday 😁😁
Im waiting for 2035 now!
Anyone else with me?!
3:19 "We can't eat any of this because Windex is not for drinking"

WHOOO eats their fortune cookie like that?!?
Oh wow those A or B answers were gettin' reckless! Y'all should leave stuff in Energy Drink for a month
Leaving things in urine for a month
Wait how did links glasses get in there🤔
6:55 if Rhett was a horse, he would eat strawberries instead of carrots. 
No big deal here, just a man feeding his best friend fruit while conducting science.
orgys and crack I like this video
pleased to have looked up groutdaddy.biz without being disappointed
Lol go to the website! They made it just for link! 😂😂
Y’all should do Will it Margarita! The basics and of each one being tequila and triple sec then adding in whatever juices
THE 17TH WAS MY BITHDAY-
13:08 the lamb was literally brain washed by them 😂
Hydrogen peroxide next 🤔
LINK: "I don't have a seagull..." Well, not anymore!
This was pure genius
why was link just feeding rhett stawberries lol
tickle me elmo oragy LMAOoOOO
They missed a great opportunity for a joke about brain washing
Anyone else glad Rhett and Link bought Smosh?
You should leave things in diet soda! That would be an episode
I'm surprised they haven't tried just water yet 😂🤷🏻
watching your videos at night seriously bothers me because i always watch them in the morning.
Answering the questions no one asked. Here for it.
What would happen if you left a window in Windex for a month?

lmbo I wasn't aiming for your mouth
I like how Rhett admits to watching those surgery type videos on YouTube. Lol.
June 3rd is my birthday!
Guess you can say that lamb only has clean thoughts now.
Left on a shelf hydrogen peroxide
Link is me shoving food into my friends mouths during random conversation like its totally normal
I feel putting glasses on your face that were just sitting in a chemical that is bad for your eyes may be a bad idea.
JUNE THIRD IS MY BIRTHDAY!
Windex is non-toxic & therefore it is edible.
You're welcome. 😉
Number 7 on trending
Link: Crack...
Rhett: Crack...
Me: A new way to make crack 🙃

6:55 so...is nobody going to talk about how random that was?
May 17..?
I was going to comment the other day and suggest this, but I didn't.  I'm glad to see it's already been thought of and filmed.  Yay! :)
Nonot the end of gmm
Rhett momentarily becomes Thanos at 5:25
Awe I'll miss you guys I know you're back in June but still. I'll just have to watch past episodes ❤
Whoever comes up with those descriptions deserves a raise
HE GOT THE STRAWBERRIES FOR MY BOY
Attention Post:  It's "unfazed".
PLZZZ leave things in apple cider vinegar I wanna see what happens 🤔
Injecting Windex directly into the brain makes you smarter 👌 Giving this advice to my doctors 👏
You two look like Mel Gibson if Mel Gibson was split into two people each with half his age...
When someone dies,
It's a good mythical mourning.

GMM: What happens when you leave gummy bears in Windex for a month?

3:15am
YouTube: leaving things in Windex for a month

Rhett folding that underwear gave me an idea/topic for a possible future episode. Rhett and Link Mary Kondo various clothing items?
Who has been here since season 7 or before?
June 3 my birthday
What's amazing about this show is that as it grows older, so do the viewers. A lot of the viewers, myself included, who started watching towards the beginning, many years ago are also growing older. Meaning these jokes that they tell are more appropriate for the viewers who have been there from the beginning. And I love it
Can you do a dishwasher competition?
1,690'th comment
Please use ur OG intro this one is bad
1:16 I don’t think he meant that😂
Okay but fr y’all need to go to groutdaddy.biz like link said. It’s actually a thing
Leave things in food colouring
Not gonna lie. The whole "leaving things in X" series is getting super old with me.
Exclusively Exclusive, put that on a t-shirt
They should put things in pine Sol for month I think that would be interesting
Woulda been a lot cooler if this was “Where in the world do these International glass Cleaning Products come from”
I like how they nonchalantly feed each other now without masculine protest like in previous seasons lol. So much more satisfying!
I right clicked the link in the description but not the rhett
OMG I remember the past when I used to watch you all the time imma start that again
I only got two right.
your next vid should be trying weird things on a pb&j like hot cheetos
Can’t wait for the summer uploads! :D
IM SO EXITED for Josh's show
Like if gmm should do a will it soda stream
Yaaaaay Josh!!!!
Ok the random rhett feeding was freeking hilarious lmao
There was a lot of wacky chaotic energy in this episode
Who else rewinded the video to see if Link really didn’t have his glasses on?😂
Are these two married to each other?
5:10 gummies.
the grout daddy site actually exists
and it is just a most likely photoshopped picture of link scrubbing a tile floor with a toothbrush
The deadpan humor in this episode!😂
This just in! 2 guys on the internet leave brains in windex for a month and inadvertently start the zombie apocalypse!
The fortune cookie one makes me worry for anyone who has ever accidentally eaten the fortune.
Will it slim Jim mention me if u use idea
Damn they are good at this game
If I ever meet link I'm gonna ask him were zelda is get it
The glasses bit never gets old
Who else always goes back to see if Links glasses are on or not
Y'all are going to have a bunch of crackheads putting lamb brain into a jar Windex😂😂😂
When Rhett was cutting the brain, my head began to heart.
Coincidence? I think not.
Lil' Windex would be proud!
5:23 rhett started going insane
groutdaddy.biz          you wont be dissapointed
someone actually made a groutdaddy.biz page for Link
3:06 
Link: it’s big in there 
My Brian: don’t say it 
My family: don’t say it 
My friends: don’t say it 
Me : that’s what she said.
Whats up with Link feeding Rhett strawberries? lol!
Who else ships them?
I love watching you guys make me laugh
Did Link age 25 years in 2019?
Whoever wrote the options for this video must have some interesting internet history 😂😂
why do i ship them ?
Whomever believes those briefs were ‘clean’ has much lower standards for underwear than I do

Randomly feeding Rhett straw Berry’s
I'm curious as to what happens if they leave stuff in contact solution

I really need a timelapse videos of all the shelf items doing what they are doing.
They finish on my birthday, what an amazing gift, a season finale :))
Has anybody wondered if they recycle?
That slim jim looked so small in Rhett’s hands..
Lol he just randomly fed him 😹😹 strawberries 🍓
Rhett and Link are like the grown up, male version of Sam and Carly from iCarly
Just an fyi... The word is 'unfazed' :-) Love the show.
First like and it's only Tuesday good mythical morning beasts
Will you do a bottled water taste test
I was hoping when he said I don’t have a pet seagull... well I don’t anymore 😂
I really shouldn’t be eating while watching this 🤢😫
It’s “unfazed;” “phase” is for phases of the moon and whatnot while “faze” means perturbed
Just wanted to let you guys know I hope you’re having a great 2019 so far. Unfortunately I’m not but I prey you do!!! 💗💗💗💗💗
Lmao the strawberries 😂 ps I love this “series” y’all need to redo some more episodes. I may never know what will or will not ever taco.. or meatball.. so much unknown. MAKE IT ALL KNOWN!
Boy, someone is paying attention to the viewer count in coordination with food thumbnails
Why were you randomly eating strawberries
Leave stuff in tears for a month
Excited about mythical chef josh having his own show but sad LTAT is being replaced
Anyone else stop watching to build up episodes of gmm had to watch this one
5:43 if a girl is wearing a clean one and she starts her period, that's what it looks like
5:48 Rhett really reminded me of Chris Hemsworth
what are the odds that i'm eating my slim jim while watching this episode.. mind blown
I just can’t even be bothered to care anymore when they announce a “new show/project” because I know it’ll be gone after one season
Never thought that I'd learn how to make crack in a gmm video
yas i  finally got them all right without second guessing myself
You guys should play snake oil!
When I ask my friend if they watch Gmm how they gonna say no, it’s trending
They should of said 
Dissolved like ProJared’s fan base
Those are some hilarious simile's
3:51 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The season finale is on my birthday. WHY😭😭😭
Left for a month in a mix(vodka+windex){something like that}
do a what happens if you leave stuff in  ketchup for a month
Peroxide might be a good one.
Hello random strawberries
I miss ten feel tall
4:18 "We don't know what these are" Sure, Link. ;)
“Unfazed” is the correct version of the homophone that you wanted. Still another really fun GMM!
Guys you should bring mail time back
May 17 is my birthday your final episode  will be like a birthday prestent
The best thing to put his glasses in
Groutdaddy.biz is an awesome dad joke! Ha Ha!
I'm early! That's a:

Rhett looks like Krieger from Archer in this coat
Soak things in sprite or Gatorade
GROUTDADDY.BIZ IS AN ACTUAL THING I'M CRYING
May 17th? It’s only the 14th
Here's an idea: leaving things in drain-o
Leaving rhett and link in a state of despair for one month???
I cant watch the last episode Friday
I gotta stop watching GMM while eating breakfast.....
Always curious
Nobody:
Rhett and link: What if we put gummy bears in windex for a month
That lamb got BRAINWASHED
In case you were curious (I was) the movie they are referring to is not real. Guess I can't make fun of it now.
thanos thinking about who to snap away 5:22
LA water next.
I’m going to be ~that~ person: Technically “unphased” should be spelled “unfazed”
Lil windex approves
leaving this site 4 a month✌
you meant to say may 14 right
Link eating that fortune cookie was like watching a snake eat it’s prey. 😂
I kind of wish they would give a quick scientific explanation of why the reactions happen
Water whippin that lamb brain
I wonder if they are brothers or just friends
*unfazed
It’s depressing I’m still awake and for this notification lol
Good Mythical Summer starts on my birthday
In 2035 we’ll be using USB’s huh? 😂
lmfao tell me I wasn't the only one to check out groutdaddy.biz. Not disappointed!
Who else went to the website groutdaddy.biz lol
How about a video where you guys  leave stuff in urine for a month?
I love how it was totally not weird to feed him strawberries but thats like the biggest cliche
Can you guys do another calorie countdown challenge? I loved that episode!
why is link wearing the most sad shirt ever? hahah lol
L love you guys.
Leave something in a jar with squash for 1 year
They should do Gatorade!
You guys NEED to timelapse these sometime!
5:18 when people see what's inside my heart
They should do leaving stuff in Gatorade for a month
This is literally how I begin my day, every day. Don't know what I'll do during summer 😬
12:57 me when I have to dishes after a big family dinner
history repeats itself 
1:15
6:22 Link... no
Leave things in urine for a month
So Close to a 'Queen Sweep' 😂
Rhett is exactly right about the knee surgurey thing I was thinking the exact same thing
Friday is my birthday

Guy on the left is STONDED😏 GMM
The teacher: I hope you guys arent doing drugs


The Kids: No sir 


Also the kids:

The strawberries are back 😂
WHATS UP EITH THE STRAWBERRIES
Why does link start feeding Rhett strawberries
Funny. 

I don't remember sitting in windex for a month.
i can smell the windex on this one
9:18-9:20 link looks like that girl from the vine “ I want to be famous”
What happens when you leave something in peroxide
i'm very intrigued
Guys. Chill with the descriptions. I want to be able to watch this with my mom.
Just once... JUST ONCE I want them to say ‘Let’s discuss that’
4:04 Link = #KingHarkinian????
Also 4:00
They should try soy sauce
Gonna be the first to say it. Their research team has too much time on their hands
Wow what a finale. Only if Rhett and link wrote season 8 of game of thrones finale there might just be peace
www.groutdaddy.com
hmmm.....
Do ammonia or lemon juice next
Every year new intro?
What about the missing team members??? We want updates
The Gummie Bears disappeared:

The Gummie Bears Dissolved. They are still present but they are in solution. camera zooms in on my face
Crazy! We were just at the Ryman too!! Happy summer everyone!!
But put things in tide for a month
Leave stuff in urine. Thank me later.
“Shrink and harden like a piece of coal between Anne Hathaway’s butt cheeks”
Im SOO excited I've never been this early
First time I've seen one of these videos in like 2 years.
WTF is that gayass feeding each other?
Leave stuff in sweet and sour sauce for 2 weeks
Red bull for a month
How do u overcome a rejection and friendzoned at the sme time.
I gotta start sleeping
5:22 ok... this is me
5:06 for video title.
amen
Them feeding each other is the type of friendship I want
You guys seriously should get Twenty One Pilots, Tyler and Josh, on this show next season or at least before the end of the year. That would be such a good episode! you could do a duo vs duo or something too! Think about it! ||-//
So is LTAT coming to an end then?
I’m still hoping for a hot sauce
The fortune was correct
so basically you're forcing the mythical crew to keep working on the mythical society while you relax all summer? 😂😂
Whatabout urine? Or bacon grease?
i love the windex bottle in the back of the groutdaddy.biz website lmao
Next should be what happens when you leave items in gasoline. Safety first!
Go away new intro
“Windex is not for drinking “ 




Welp
This is not an episode for children 😂
Hey Groutdaddy.biz
Who catches up on these only at night not in the mornings🙋
I’m already interested it chef Josh has his own show.
can you try urine?
Rhett and Link need a talk show
They're so edgy today
LEAVE THINGS IN NAIR
Leaving things in slime for a month?
The funny thing is it not may 17 yet (at least for me)
I remember when they accidentally put in a chair leg in the jar
My 17 is my birthday !!!!!
Leave Link in mercury for a month.
7:05 I’m crying😭
5:21 ☺️ omg that’s so adorable
I'd love to see you both put your heads in windex for a month
After watching this video I think we need some rated R GMM, this video was kinda PG-13, but I think we need a step up
"Someone you admire is watching you from afar."  Rhett, isn't this just the confirmation you needed that Rhianna watches your show??? And you didn't even realize it!
5:32 looks like someone's time of the month
Are we not gonna talk about the strawberries?
I love your show and today is 5/15/2019 and I'm 9 and the doter of the picher and to day I got medl for doing GPMS pep sqod  aka the rock stares.P.S.on the next video my name is Jesilyn.
It’s cause they’re the Panda Express ones
Leave stuff in honey for a month
Aka murdering random things in windex by intoxicating them.
I'm such a rat for these videos and I have no idea why
I wouldn't eat& drink if these foods&drinks were soaked in windex
Do it go on do it Www.groutdaddy.biz
Yes groutdaddy.biz is Links website
After reading any fortune from a cookie, had "in bed" to your sentence. It always works and makes it a lot better
At 5:22 Rhett remind me of thanos
Thanos:5:23
im kind of disappointed that the mythical crew didn’t place funny fortunes into those cookies </3
6:14 Link I think that you went too far with that one.
Where did u get this idea
Why are they so good at this?
What was up with the strawberries ?? Lmao
THEY STILL POST?
Tomato juice
Rhett making gummies disappear is just hilarious😂😂😂
At least you could afford Windex. Moe can only afford Windell.
Leave things in urine for a month.
Am I the only one who felt like reading the fortunes was messages from the universe (Law of Attraction) ?
groutdaddy.biz is a real website
Link is starting to get more and more suggetive
I sware they did windex before?
More strawberries!
I feel like there was some type of bet going on with who could feed the other more or something
When thanos snapped  his fingers 5:22
5:35 
COUGHHH
I sincerely appreciate that you took the time and effort to buy groutdaddy.biz and build a landing page. It's the little things that make a difference.
They are great. That's all.

I like how rhet  is just eating the strawberries and not knowing what they are but trusting link
what happens when you leave stuff urine for a month?
You could tell they were pissed after the joke went too far...
In some way I want to say you're crazy to like cleaning Link, but sometimes I feel cleaning is the best way to get rid of stress
I’m gonna have a great birthday gift , a new season of GMM !!! I love that birthday is on June 3rd ! You know that Florida man thing .. well mine was man throws cheese burger at pregnant woman ....
Who else loves these?

I don’t know why at first I thought link was feeding Rhett ghost peppers at like 7:00
So no one is going to talk about how link randomly fed Rhett two strawberries in the middle of the episode?
Now I like none of the foods anymore
Leaving things in the sun for a month, in a jar of tea.

Is the lump of coal between buttcheeks a joke I'm missing or just a weird thing they said?
Intelligence idiots, love these guys 🤓
Why is Link constantly feeding Rhett strawberries??? Last few episodes he's feeding him...
Y’all should do acetone
Put some bacon on it
1:56 Well I’d assume not anymore

Use Dawn Soap next time
The writing for the guesses are really not that funny in my opinion. I think it's just trying too hard to be edgy.

3:50 Anyone catch that gummy bear slide in Rhett's shirt pocket
Oh man that's funny, just looking at the teaser image the thought the immediately popped into my head was "Either those shrink down and get hard or they disappear entirely I bet." I couldn't guess what would actually happen but I feel like I should get a consolation prize for guessing both options.
12:56
How the Windex do you get 480 dislikes here?
Have y’all left things in pee for a month
I need a Link to casually feed me strawberries while i'm doing other things... Or a Rhett to shove fortune cookies in my mouth to shut me up.
Link's lab coat is a girl's...
Link wasn't kidding about his website, that scares me
0:56 No one caught that?

My birthday is 2 days after June 3rd and my mom said she might get tickets to one of your shows in Indianapolis on like June 21st or something
I wonder which of the mythical crew wrote these options. I don't think they will be doing it again. My guess is the auburn girl, can't remember her name
Ok keep up the fortune cookie thing. Lol 🤣
Hello Darkness... My old friend.
You guys should leave things in lemon juice next!

Yes, you aren't the only one who rewinded to see if he wore his glasses the whole time.
i love the running gags when they do the left on a shelf episodes
Every time they do this show everything smells bad so they were like, what will smell good?
i used to watch these w the kids i babysit but now it’s gotten a liiiittle too vulgar and they ask questions that they don’t need to know 😬
I’m eating a slim Jim lol
Casually feeds Rhett strawberries
"I wasn't aiming for your mouth, it was more of a shower"
-Link, 2019

6:18-6:21 Rule 34 much.
LEMON JUICE
A small act of charity, like feeding someone a fortune cookie???
What about Ltat 😓
I could've drinked all that Windex
Could you guys do things inside of bacon grease?
it’s not a “leaving things in ____ for a month” episode if link doesn’t get his glasses and say, “so that’s where those have been.” 😂
so  i have been meaning to do this for awhile but i think i might do it now in the first ever episode of GMM Rhett says that the first ever rule of GMM is to never mention Justin Beiber so I am going through every episode from start to finish to see if they break that rule and if so how many times.
Link eating the fortune cookies CRACKED me up.
1:15 Hahahaha yeah I assumed that 3 or 4 videos after i subscribed to the channel ;)
Yay, I knew the brain wasn't going to expand, simply because brains are in liquid all the time.
This took Mariah Carey’s lyric too far 😂💕
8:30 "unphased" is supposed to be "unfazed", btw
Wats the BASS 
On the wall ?? :D
choice descriptions are amazing!
What happens when you put milk in a humidifier?
episode spoilers, stop reading if you haven't watched ROFL I lost it when Link started feeding Rhett the strawberries.
They should do one of these episodes with Neil deGrasse Tyson
is it crack? lol
its meh birthday and well i dont want it to be id rather be ded since thats what i was born to do
Bro I was trying to eat
I told my mom about GMM and this was the first and only video she watched........
Cotton candy randy is watching you form afar
Do a Coffee Taste Test!
Shoul leave things in the cleaner the works
They keep feeding eachother....what is going on? 😂
Any other girl think about something else instead of wine for the underpants
Just one request for the new season - keep feeding Rhett with strawberries but covered with chocolate. :)
I love when I watch GMM while having lunch 🤣
The descriptions have me dying laughing lolol
wow.... groutdaddy.biz does exist xD
Dionysos would be proud of those underwear
you guys are my favourite i love your channel
You need to get Bill Nye on one of these shows and have him guess at the result.
They actually own groutdaddy.biz lol
link feeding rhett. you guys are so cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You guys started a whole trend from doin this now everyone does it lol
would you rather have a man in a labcoat feed you strawberries or fortune cookies? much depends upon your reply.
I love the strawberries 😂
9:04 Anybody else mesmerized by Link eating fortune cookies? I just noticed my self staring at his mouth for a good few minutes!! 🥠🥠
5:24 Rhett becomes Thanos lol #endgame
Man I’m gonna miss LTAT!!!
Rhett feeding Link Fortune Cookies and Link concerningly eating them is now my new favorite thing

Nobody:
GMM: Gummy bear in winded for a MOntH
Every single time I watch one of these leaving things in things videos I forget about Link feeding Rhett strawberries until he grabs one and I invariably cackle
What's with the strawberries
why is Tormund Giantsbane in here
I think now Rhett will have to feed Link fortune cookies in each Leaving Things video!
WE LOVE THE EARTH IT IS OUR PLANETTTTT
Cotton Candy Randy must have done those descriptions
Can we get an episode where you leave stuff in a mixture of all the other substances (except air)
These left-in-a-jar episodes get dark. It's brilliant.
I'm so excited for Josh's show
Someone should make a compilation of link saying "in my mouth".
Yay Josh has a show!!
They oughta separate these into "Safe to watch while eating" and "DO NOT WATCH WHILE EATING" lmao
10:00 I thought Rhett was gonna say something about RiRi
*unfazed
leave stuff in dr. pepper for 2 months
Them strawberries 😆
Yaaay a show for Josh. He's awesome and links keeping the tradition of feeding Rhett strawberries
You should have had Cotton Candy Randy write the fortunes!
every episode with Link feeding Rhett strawberries is a great episode
And now you are going to disappear, and you are going to disappear, and you are going to disappear, and you are going to disappear!!!! I love Rhett's crazyness!!
I enjoyed the feeding time.
You should leave things in soap. Not sure if it will do anything but it’s an idea
Can u leave thing in Gatorade for a month
"It's still pink on the inside."
🤣😂
For summer you guys should do a "will it lemonade?" Video!!!!!🍋🍋
The way link becomes a human fortune cookie was the best thing that's happened all year!!!
"There's a Darkness at the Bottom" is the title of the next Novel right?
I almost forgot about the strawberries!!
Anyone else watch that gummy bear sneak its way into Rhett's pocket? 


They will find it next time
I need Link's shirt .  I am a manager for a group home and love to wear awesomely positive shirts.
Love you guys. Love the show. But the "Leaving things" bit is getting a little old. I'll still hit the Like button though!
@youresoloud A compilation of Rhett/Link’s faces that they make when the other person in talking. Inspired by Rhett at 1:17
"Someone you admire is watching from afar" 
Link: looks to the heavens
Someone please take 3:46 and slomo it and put pour some suger on me over it.
why o i make the same mistake every time and settle down with a nice wholesome meal to watch these super nasty episodes...
Y'all doing an Asia tour? If not, please do!
Oh noooo I'm gonna miss LTAT
It's funny because on the nail polish video someone committed "do things in windex".....and now they have!!!!!
#gmm4life

1:16 damn, y’all some fiends
Tokyooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hey june the 1st is my birth day so Ꭷℴ ℱ :D I'm turning 14 so i can't wait for The new episodes （╯°□°）╯  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Actually went to groutdaddy.biz, I have never been more pleasantly surprised. Thanks for making my day!
Someone you admire is watching from afar 
Link: huh? 
Audience: huh? 
Me: realised they love us and we are watching from far away
i love that groutdaddy.biz is a real thing
This might be the least PG episode ever. I love it.
8:30 the word is "unfazed"
What a great birthday present, a new GMM season!
can't wait for josh's series
Rhrett and link should.make their own fortune cookies
Link's glasses are indestructible, it seems.
9:07 *Unfazed.
Leaving things in hair gel?
These episodes never get old! I'm glad they still do these :)
Your season finale is the same day my daughter turns a month old
my birthday is today
What about things in oil for a month
1:15 i have done cocke as well
so ashamed they didnt say "in bed" after they read the fortunes.
Link having the hardest time ever eating fortune cookies is the best
Yeah these choice descriptions are just weird
but it’s night
gummy bears part~~

me: wow not one of them got into your mouth

Rhett right after me: literally not one of them got in my mouth

me: JINX
Literally only watching this for the jokes at this point
Can't wait for Josh's show!!
Who writes these analogies 😂
Why did they keep feeding each other?😂😂😂
Does Link resemble a well groomed Tormund Giant's Bane to anyone else?
change the title to "The GMM crew make crack"
My birthday is the 17th! 😁
Try dirty bong water
Is this really the content we've resorted to?
and now I know how to get my friends to shut up. imma need to order a lot of fortune cookies
I've only been watching for a month, i still don't get the strawberry thing.
Please do pee next
10:00 rihannas watching you rhett
never expected Windex to completely dissolve gummy bears!!  great episode.
5:22 me at all my brain cells when I decide to  pull an all nighter
Does anyone else not watch their videos when they're about to go on summer vacation so you can watch them while they're gone?
Try pee on the shelf
I wanna see stuff left in _______  vs. water
Another exciting thing that happens on the 17th is that my school (well my grade 7th) is going to a waterpark/amusement park called magic springs.
FYI - groutdaddy.biz is a real thing.

Yup.
groutdaddy.biz is an actual website that's great xD
Back on June 3rd my b-day is the 4tg
omg they're finally making a josh show
I went to the site and was not disappointed in groutdaddy.biz
Waiting for "Left on a shelf: Urine Edition"
Y’all have been using Windex so much I’m starting to wonder if there’s a brand deal 🤔😂
I almost forgot about the strawberry thing xD
big is my signature move when i smell my own signature
this was very useful to me
Do coffee next
Leave things in urine for a month lol
Now do Petrol please :)
12A
You guys have come so far and I’m really happy about it
intro wack af
why did this video seem  so quiet????
Noooooo. Why am i here?
I haven’t watched in ages, they haven’t changed at all
1:39 me when i got hit in the nutz
Link discovered he prefers hot food. 

Rhett once again realizes he just like to eat food period...
Link: dips congealed fat in hot sprite

Rhett: stares uncomfortably That was not necessary
"It's better than you giving her bone broth"
"its not broth"-Rhett 2019
No one:
Not a single soul:
Rhett: yOu kNoW iN sWitZeRLaNd
Rhett: unwraps the whopper nice 
Link: just throws it everywhere 😂
Do "Wet Dry Foods vs Dry Wet foods"
Should have done “cold hot chocolate” VS “hot chocolate milk”
"I'm a cold clam chowder in the streets, and a hot coleslaw in the sheets!"

~Link 2019
Rhett 2018: So, Community College..
Rhett 2019: So, In Switzerland...
“ Mom, you’re like a cold whopper to me. “ Link 2019
"It's better than you giving her bone broth"
-Stevie 2019
You guys definitely need to make a part 2. I have so many questions left unanswered .... Like a hot smoothie? or cold lasagna
LINK ATE TOMATOES IN THE WHOPPER!!
“It’s not broth” THAT WAS SO SMUG WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT IT
You know what? I need a full version of that food temperature swap song
I actually won something without doing anything. This is the most GMM experience ive ever had.
Rhett: is hot food cold better than cold food hot?

Me:*has an aneurism from the  complexity of that title*
I was expecting the wheel of mythicality submission to be someone from Switzerland tbh 😹😹🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭
This video was a lot more sexualised then I would’ve expected 🤣
We discovered Link likes Hot food and Rhett just likes Food.
Just fwi: We haven't lost our minds in Switzerland.
Idk about you but...
7:53
Rhett & Link: This Is A New Dish
Filipinos: Bruh We Invented That
As a Swiss I appreciate the recognition 👍🏻🥰
Rhett: she texts me a lot but i dont always tell you
Link: smiles okay * secretly wanting to muder rhett*😂
14:08
Link: "You can make it." 
Rhett: "You're going to make it."
Me: cue totally unexpected crying
Hot cold food all the way. Fried ice cream, need I say more?

Also, hot Sprite is amazing for an upset stomach.
Let’s be honest...




All the people who voted for Cold Whopper knew that Rhett would like it
Späsel for the win. It definitely is spelled with umlauts, too.
Rhett: "It's not broth..."
Me: GAGS
Honestly kinda needed that weird inspirational speech to get me to go study for my calc exam tomorrow lol
I, The King of Nachos, have been making hot guac for years... of course it's good!
That parody was the best intro into a game I've ever seen.
I can't tell if a Cold Hot Pocket is just an oxymoron, or a sin against humanity.
I love how Rhett keeps talk about Switzerland lol 😂
YOU put the hot in hot pockets. Remember that.
Does anybody else love the theme song of the vid  that link sang 0:45
I believe in an unrelated segment, they discovered that they both like Hot Orange Juice, and wondered if it was a thing they could hype.
I read an interesting fact that humans can hear the difference between hot and cold water being poured. You guys should do a blind hearing test to see if it's true!
You guys like hot SWEET stuff, and dislike cold savory stuff. lol
I thought all burger king whoppers were supposed to be cold.
please have AMERICAN CORNBREAD vs MEXICAN CORNBREAD!!!
Do more these Fan vs Hosts I like this.
people in 1960: "in 2019 we will have flying cars and time machines"

people in 2019 :"hot cold food vs cold hot food"
Is it just me or does anyone else think that whoppers or any fast food burgers are already served cold? 😂
No one does a segment intro like GMM. Genius!
Why does Link remind me of Garth from Wayne's World? (Not a bad thing...Garth is my patronus 😂)
That look of that hot cole slaw was so disconcerting. No matter how good they said it was I could never be convinced
The hot slaw is probably more of a cabbage casserole at that point.
QUESTION: what happens if us Mythical Beasts score a 50/50?
Note: hardboiled eggs are perfectly fine when cold
Damnit. I thought they'd prefer the cold whoppers. XD
No One:

Rhett: IN SWITZERLAND..
Sees cold hot pocket
Me: wait thats illegal
Truly I love cold leftover chicken tenders or steak. Oh man cold steak! It's so good.
The cold hot pocket and hot, dirty martini is what I'll feed my enemies, hahahaha
Thanks for that bit at the end guys, I really needed it today. Love ya'll too
7:13 "You know why it's not bad? Because it's not." - Link 2019👌🏽
5:09 lol i love rhett, hes my man.
Rhett should change his name to Zelda XD
Link: That's a little hard
Me: whispers That's what she said
Rhett: opens whopper bag very carefully
Link: tears into the bag like a wild animal
Link is really going to need that fancy toilet after this.
OMG THE GUY AT THE END WAS MY TECHNOLOGY TEACHER
I love this! we need to do more stuff like this!!!
You guys have the best intros on YouTube
Every time I decide to watch one of their videos again, they’ve changed their intro...
"Someone who speaks well, and can inspire people..."
A BARD, A BARD ,LINK A BARD!
As a swiss person this episode felt really surreal :)
Hot-Cold Sodas,
and Cold-Hot Popcorn,
RIGHT NOW! (right now!)
in the Projection Booth!
welcome to another episode of "Rhett Discovering How Much He Likes to Eat"
I feel like every time they do a food taste test we just relearn the Rhett loves (almost) all food
4:33 to 5:10 very um weird conversation.
Shuold of tryed hot lunchables
Melted ice cream is the only one I can exept hot


Oh and cold french fries
Made in belgium usa!!!



I mayself got 4 points
OH MY GOD! MY DAD GOT VIP TICKETS TO SEE YOU GUYS I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU GUYS! SEE YOU GUYS IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA ON SEPTEMBER 7TH!
7:09 A link smiling makes me smile. ( love ya mythical crew. ^^ )
6:44 Rhett casually unwraps burger, Link savages it.
SOMEONE CALL THE DOCTOR! 

GOT A CASE OF A FOOD TEMP SWAP! 
"Shut your mouth." Link's always adorable
Hot Sprite (or other lemon-lime soda) with apple cider mix.  So good.
I LoVe tO SaY GeLaTiNouS
Hmmm.... link appears to be wearing a martini bikini... 😂😂
I speak from experience when I say that refrigerated burgers are perfectly fine.
Hello from Switzerland....where everything you said about Switzerland happens in the exact way you said it.......or maybe not.
You guys should start including video of Rhett & Link singing the intros 👍
No one:
Literally no one:
Not a single dang person ever:
Link: MIXES CONGEALED FAT INTO HOT SPRITE AND DRINKS IT
Why link are you so controlling 😂
I'm from Switzerland and I really connected with this episode, thanks for thinking about us Swiss, Rhett and Link :)
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT LINK ATE 🍅 TOMATOES 🍅 IN THE WHOPPER WITHOUT COMPLAINING???!!!! the hypnosis worked!!!
what was the music in the mini intro hot and cold thing
4:35-5:12 was one of my favorite parts of this episode lmao
Also "hot coleslaw in the sheets" ~Link
Hot banana split is called binignit in the Philippines 😂
I got my bardic inspiration, now to slay a dragon.
Yoooo this is honestly relevant
Why Switzerland all the time? D: feelin strange now... greetings from Switzerland tho
"Hot Guac" mixed with pasta is great :)
What do you call a hot coleslaw

A Hoteslaw
So many clichés about switzerland 😂 i mean the ski part is right but a lot of people dont get tired counting money🤣
Thanks for just skipping Georgia...
13:00
If you ever need a pep talk, this'll do it 😍😭
I don't know why, but I REALLY liked that WOM submission! It was funny and he seemed so natural. Definite fave!
This was a pretty damn clever idea for an episode. You still got it GMM.
4:54  
Bone Broth 😂
Do the Swiss just love having all of the hot things after hitting the slopes? XD
Cold but thawed pizza rolls ♡♡♡
No one : 

My mind: tordoroki hmmm
They missed their chance on hot Kool-Aid

cc: JulianSmith
The best thing is cold toaster studels
FYI clearly Canadian is back on shelves
DAT VOCAL RANGE THO
I cried at the bone broth jokes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
In Ireland, we drink hot sprite when you have an upset stomach. 😂 it’s supposed to solve all y’problems
“It’s better than you giving her bone broth”
“It’s not bone broth” haha
can you guys collab with Dude perfect!!!!
Maybe try some actual Swiss food in the next ep 😂
“And now we’re going to inspire you like a person who is good at inspiring” 
Link 2019
Oh I've definitely had a cold Whopper
Matter of fact I can't remember the last time Burger King served me one hot....
Yikes
"Shut ya mouth" is why I love Link lol
Love from Switzerland 🤣🤣
OH.MY.GOSH. 👏. THAT KATY INTRO. SO GOOD.😩😍😂😂😂
6:44  The difference between Rhett & Link, visualized
Hi!, your video is cool
that looks nice.
Keep Sharing
next from youresoloud: Rhett Talking About Switzerland Activities for 3 minutes
Hot banana spilt is a thing in norway
And you knew that I knew that you knew that I was moving to Switzerland!!! Whoaaa
Bone broth 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Link: you reading us like a... 
dont even finish link nice transition to promote your book but I already preordered it.
14:17 only swissbeatbox and codfish fans get this. In Switzerland
Not a big fan of the voting system btw, its way too 90's and old and just wants to be hip
I don't know if your intern was insane or a genius for the whole hot pocket thing
Hot Martini. Shaken, Not Cold.
İts better than you giving something to her
Rhett:its not broth
best outro ever!!!
Oh man, guys, I feel so.... Inspired...? Right now? I think?
Boy I need to start sleeping
For some reason this is my favourite channel....
Someone get him a plane ticket to Switzerland please lmao
“Mom, you’re like a cold Whopper to me”

- Link Neal, 2019
I'm picking up on some serious Projared vibes during this episode
Rhett: “She texts me a lot.”

Link:

hahahaha weird flex but ok
I am Swiss 🙈🇨🇭
In switzerland we don’t really have Banane Split 🤣🤣🤣🤣
that intro song! ... let me say it again.. THAT INTRO SONG!
at 4:08 its called Rivella
Wtf does rhett think Switzerland is like?😂
The Swiss have created so many life changing food creations 😂😂👍
Link and the egg face! 🤣🤣🤣 i gagged for you, Link.
One of the best intro jingles.... Ever..
When you put guac on a hot burrito, the guac gets hot after a while, and it's still good. :D
Link:
bites into a cold sandwich
Mom?
Did anyone else realize that link kept the tomato in the whopper? I’m so proud of him!!! 😭
That intro tune was amazing
This is REAL news.
my pea brain can't handle "Hot Cold Food Vs. Cold Hot Food"
I love your chanal
Who else likes the creative song intros?
guacamole definitely gets heated up in some good dip recipes
I haven't even started watching the video and I could already tell you that cold hotpockets aren't worth it 😂😁
Is Rhett a little extra....inappropriate in this video? 😂
I am in Switzerland already, I live here
You know why It is not bad? Because it is not.
 Link 2019
Ima just say 
Hello to the people that haven’t vite because diesent have a Twitter account 
Ps:I also don’t have an account
Like new intro, but CHANGE THE SONG BACK!
Hi I love your YouTube channel
Cold hot food 100% 👌🏼
I have drumline auditions tomorrow, thanks for the motivation!
I lost it when Link turned back to the camera with the hot pocket on his shoulder!!! 🤣🤣
Wait weren't you guys going on a break? I was not expecting an episode.
But I shall accept these blessings lmao.
The song😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I needed that pep talk. Thanks Rhett and link.
0:29 Wow Link, your teeth should be immune to ice cream then.
I am NOT being sarcastic.
Lady: its better than you giving her bone broth
Rhett: it's not broth
Lol hahahahaha
Why he always comparing de food with us (Swiss people) 🤦🏻😂😂😂
qwertyuiop[
The inspirational talk, as goofy as it was, made me tear up. It's been a rough time lately for me, and just hearing you guys say inspiring stuff was enough to get the tear ducts releasing. Thanks for the pick me up, guys ^_^ keep being your Mythical best!
Did Link say he eats his fries first???
Only ogs remember the intro with the rooster on the mountain
i'm very impresssd with link's intro jingle
Now you have to do a tuna martini right? If we browbeat you?
“It’s not broth” - it’s all bone ;)
Warm banana split is good for winter 😂
As a swiss person I have to tell you:
We also like cold foods.
The inspiration part at the end was like a warm hug. Thank you, I needed that. I think we all did. We love you guys so much ❤️
The swiss are going to be like "WTF"
The song in the beginning was good
I like cold buffalo wings👌🏾
if link didn't take that 3rd fake bite of his cold hot pocket, he'd get an oscar, what a performance 👏
This is pure sacrilege
Pee Wee Herman would be proud of that ice cream soup.
I eat frozen eggo waffles , chocolate chip and blueberry are the best 🤷‍♀️
The word coagulated comes up 2 too many times this video
I love when Link is feeling the jingles after the music stops.
Didn’t know I needed those affirmations at the end😂😂also the hot pocket link left on his shoulder💀😂
I‘m from switzerland and I agree with all of what rhett said. 😂
Good job mythical beasts!! 🐓🔥
Rhett: “I like both of these...” 
what’s new, Rhett?
Extemporaneously? Link must have one of those word a day calendars.
I can NEVER, EVER, EVER go to YouTuber tours because i'm in south Victoria, Australia.
Fresh Pizza = Left Over Cold Pizza
just as good- if not better
Thank you for encouragement pre finals 😂👌👌
5:05 WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION
I don't know where they hold these surveys for the Mythical Beasts, but I'm glad I won without even lifting a finger!
6:05 ROYALE WITH CHEEZE
Hot kool aid 😂
I love Rhett and Link 😊❤️
Hot ice-cream is awesome just drink it like tea...

But if ur stomach weak you get diarrea
Put “I’m hot coleslaw in the sheets” on a T-shirt
Gagged at the bone broth. Holy fuckles
How bout' slow fast food
Damm, I only just noticed Rhett’s receding hairline
I think the real MVP is Tyler 🔥😂
For some reason l want to hear the terrible noises for losing.
Why did the final speech addressed toward the viewer make me tear up?? The night before my final exam, feeling like theres no way in the world I can do it - and you guys have made me feel like I can do anything. Got to be one of the best, most wholesome, joyful Youtube channels that exists. Thank you GMM. We love you !!!
The comments are just people quoting the video IM SORRY BUT YES, I HEARD I ALSO WATCHED THE VIDEO
I feel... inspired?... I guess?...
I got all of them right....I promise I did
"I like both of them" - Rhett 
And no one, anywhere, was the least bit surprised
apparently the swiss love everything warm, and called swassel
5:09 i love Links reaction😂

“shut your mouth”
Cold hot pockets, it defies the name, rebellious, I like it.
This was a genius idea!
I eat cold eggo would that make me weird.
I just like the crunch and I don’t have a lot of time in the morning
Woper is a slang turn in Italian
You guys should do more answering mythical beast questions, those eps were great
When you get so inspired than you get gatekeeped by Switzerland
Bruh if you cold bacon and put it in the fridge overnight... cold bacon 🤤🤤
That game name music tho 🔥
DRINK THE HOT KOOLAID if you remember that youre the dude
That ending got...weird
Actually in Indonesia there's something similar to hot banana split we called it "Kolak Pisang", but instead of melting ice-cream  (basically milk) we use coconut milk, and yes it's a dessert.
Hehe I work at Burger King imma give u a cold whopper 😏😂
This question is easily answerable without even having to test it lol
Are we going to ignore the fact that Link ate a tomato on the Big Mac??
That inspirational video actually made me smile. Thank You R&L.
Best cold is cold pizza. Or pasta. The sauce just gets around better.
Anyone from Switzerland that can confirm these new hot foods?
I love that hot vs cold food song
I'm not gonna lie that motivation at the end? EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED 😊got that radiology final friday. Should be studying. Instead getting motivation from Rhett and link. I should probably study now though. Or... watch ONE MORE GGM
Woah there Rhett, don't end up pulling a ProJared on Link.
He's awfully feisty this episode.
Hot Sprite is the ultimate medicine in Ireland 😂
Missed opportunity for hot kool aid
Coagulated mayonnaise, my favorite
the only channel that's not neck deep in drama rn
Every comment is just
Link: bla bla bla
Rhett: bla bla bla
 Lolol
About 13 mins in link has a martini bra
Bilo-bilo is similar to molten banana split. Just saying
I learned so many made up facts about Switzerland this episode and I cannot wait to tell them to everyone!
You know your wife?
Yeah I've heard of her ... 
LMFAO
I GOT ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT! its awesome how WE won this time
In conclusion: Rhett likes everything.
I Loved the rant at the end! LOL
When I read the title of the video my mind immediately went to cold hot pockets
Missed the chance to invite Julian Smith and try some hot koolaid
That intro song to the taste test was the best one yet
Some could say that this video was all the inspiration that they needed and a good time too!   XD
You guys never fail to make my day . Much love from Montana
Man why did link open the whopper like that lmaoo
Hot Sprite/7up is used as a fix all medicine in Ireland 😂
They know who the migos are? The migos should be proud.
11:04 You'll be hearing from John Mullaney and Nick Kroll's lawyers over that.
Cold pizza 🤤🤤
Fresh vs re heated
Hot Dr. Pepper was a real thing
I love the subtle dirty jokes in this show. Or maybe i just have  a filthy mind.
Try raw vs cooked things
I like my hot pockets a little cold
Brilliant intro to the taste test! Best one so far!
Whp hasn't had a cold Whopper (tm) before?
This is a game of Ice and Fire
Oh my gosh the ending is sooo funny because I'm actually in Switzerland
The intro jingles are everything 💪🏼😂 I love them
@Link #GMM Screw tomatoes and egg yolks. 💯
WE COLD AND WE HOT





ok I leave now
Dang, Link was rocking that intro song
"And a hot coleslaw under the sheets!"
"I don't even want to know what that means."
It means he writes fanfiction about being coleslaw under his bedsheets every night! :D
My first final is today so I've been up cramming. Nice to take a quick break with some GMM   :)
the majority may not of got a queen sweep but i did
“I don’t want to know what that means” -Rhett 2019 (why do I feel like that should be my life motto?)
I got so nauseous watching this 🤢😂 anyone else?
Who else never watches gmm in the morning
I love these can u do a lot more😃
I can't believe they still haven't done a try not to eat challenge after all the games they have played with food.
you're going to make it
OR ELSE
Cold whoppers are the best
We need a GMM and Alonzo Lerone mashup doing his weird food combos
This was a mistake


This should have never happened.
I like how you perceve Switzerland 😂 We’re like some people from the Alps that like strange stuff to eat
I like this it may be my favorite food
SO HOT, YET ALSO SO COLD!!!!
“Good thing you didn’t give HER the bone marrow” 😂😂
That encouragement at the end was so sweet! You can make it guys
Rhett & Link food videos are my absolute FAVORITE
Swiss everything!! Haha
"It's not broth"
Stevie beat me to the joke😭🤣😜
I eat cold pockets all the time, they’re totally fine.
This is one of the best episodes of the season
“That’s real tough to do...” -Rhett 2019 

the face of disappointment. 5:17
What I learned in this video is:
Rhett likes food
Link that’s the best fake eat I have every seen
Just in case this hasn't been said before Rhett looks like a Dothraki
hot sprite reminds me of when I'm going on a trip and i leave sprite in the car
i eat almost everything cold lol
6:50 thats what she said
call hot sprite the swiss suprise
I live in switzerlamd, so i think of you all the time ? Huh
When it's the true false section on the test and you don't know them so you guess all true.
I would have dipped the cold Whopper into the hot Sundae... just to try :)
0:44 good singing Link
I love love cold whoppers
I got the negative queen sweep.
thanks for the pep talk internet dads
"My childhood favourite , hot  martini "
The banana split is glockenspiel
saw you guys on smosh 




thank you for brightening my day
people in comments try hot jello like in a tea form its so good!
The beginning is literally lyrical genius every time and it kinda blows my mjnd
that opening song was on point!
I looked up 'Eating a hot pocket cold' and found this.
Honestly this is a genius topic.
*Swiss stereotype alert*
12:52 - proof that 52% of their fans are children. Only people to young to drink would think hot alcohol would would be better than cold cheese and pepperoni.
what does switzerland do with all of this? ^^<3
Link left the tomatoes in the burger. I'm impressed.
Some what frozen uncrustables are low-key fire
the only youtubers that make original content every single day
"Do you know why it's not bad?"
I think had a seizure trying to read the title
that was my favourite intro song parody so far
Link is brilliant for coming up with this skit!
rhett  over here really using lofi  as a adjective
That hot pocket trick is genius
Hot sprit or lil sprit is what I call my geography teacher
I swear, they get dirtier every season 😂
so is no one gonna talk ab 5:05
If their Whopper is cold, obviously someone didn't push the Whopper Button.
I'm actually in Switzerland
Is... is that Whopper dripping on Rhett's lap? XD
Thanks for saving smosh
"are we on the brink of a discovery or about to get nauseous" describes this entire show
Hey girl, do you like soup?  Cus I wanna give you my bone broth
Okay but that inspiration actually helped me
Shouldn't they have served the  Whopper the opposite way to how it's normally served?
How cereal is just oatmeal.
As a guy from switzerland I confirm everything rhett said
"Shut ya mouth."

I felt that.
For me the cold whopper is something I'd eat on a good Saturday night. I like my burgers cold only if it had lettuce and mayonnaise. The others of course can stay on. Idk, it's something about the way the lettuce is a little limp but yet still fresh along with the mayonnaise. It's good. 😊
7:05 classic Rhett
the southern shines in this episode
shutchyomouf
In switzerland we drink hot wine after ski ! Should have tried it !
I ate a cold Taco Bell beefy 5 layer burrito the other day and was loving every moment of it
Wait wait...what? Freezing Big Macs? Huh. I must have missed that fad.
Hot"bone broth"
Nobody:
Link: big MACS
Im going through my first heartbreak and that inspirational speech really helped me...
God, what song do they use for the title of the game
Rett is proper tickling me in this episode
They both are married.. Still being immature 🤣🤣
A Hot Pocket cold is just Cold Pizza rolled up
..Who doesnt like cold pizza?
The swiss drink, who they serve after skiing is called PUNSCH



I'm from switzerland
I kinda liked this new format of involving the fans. Made me feel appreciated :)
Just end the clip already 😂😂😂😂😂
The gac is good hot
Next Will It should be 
Will It Slush Ice? 
Since it’s becoming summer and hotter ☺️
Will it chip? 
Will it smoothie? 
Will it gummy?
WOW RHETT🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
cold whoppers are a normal thing for me; left over burger king is the bomb
i miss the old intro
You should come to switzerland and see what things we really do.
Not that stuff you said in the video but other special things. Try rivella =D
big mAkS 6:57
as a swiss person, i enjoyed this
11:11 oh the innuendo...
Mom ur like a cold whopper to me 😂
Snickers slightly warm is the best way to eat it ✔
I love the inspiration ヽ༼ ツ ༽ﾉ
Xoşbextin izleyicilerin bax super
I always enjoy the intro songs, they also make my day.
I had to listen to the game name song a few times,  it made me so happy.
Link, teaching me words again.
♥
The theme song to hot and cold food is amazing!
Ive never heard the word Extemporaneously until now. It means spoken without preperation.
I Got a clean sweep (like if you did)
I'm really into the guy with the lawn mower :D
Hot Cold Food.
Cold Hot Food. 

GMM just became INCEPTION.
🤣🤣🤣The end of this video is HILARIOUS!!!
'Its better than you giving her bone broth.' 'Its not bone broth hehe.' Gmm is getting dirtier and dirtier 😂
Hot ice tea? No one?
Hot spahsel, and slawsel?
Hot banana split is basically Binignit in the Philippines.
How are you guys so creative with your videos?
The hot sundae is similar to a Thai dish. Cept in Thailand, it would be banana and hot sweet syrup topped with coconut milk.
I'm worried about how I got the title immediately
regular milk       hot chocolate


proof of concept
Hold up? Who freezers big macs? Is that a thing?
The hot banana split is from Sweden, not Switzerland, and it's called a "Slurga."
I like Link's martini bikini at the end. 👙
Will corgi’s rule the world?
When they said “you’re going to make it” I actually really needed that today 😊
Aww links cute little story about the cold whopper reminding him of his mom was so sweet :’)
You need to do a podcast you guys would be good at it
Is that Brendon Urie???
Hot coleslaw 🤮
Now that segment song parody was awesome
no one: 
rhett: the swiss...
“Mom you’re like a cold whopper to me” 
Lol link I love ya dude  😂
Pop..
Tarts?
Will it poutine ?🇨🇦
I'm surprised the Wheel intro wasn't someone from Switzerland
Makes sense, Cold Food is like the sad leftovers in the fridge that you don't bother heating up at 3am after a bad date. Hot Food is like cooking ingredients
I have the clock on your opening! Lol
It's just that cold foods are usually like leftovers or something
When he recites a cards against humanity card
sometimes I order pizza, put it in the fridge and eat it cold the next day, tastes 10x better after all of the flavours have marinaded together
That segment theme song though 🔥
Disappointed you didn't reference Jullian Smith's Hot Kool-aid
Hilarious as always. “Just taste that. Shut ya mouth” 😂😂😂
Did you just miss the opportunity to call them coldpockets?
I don't know what i would do in the morning without GMM 👌
7:05 TRUE AMERICAN
Takes a sip "that's tough to do"
That song was freaking PERFECT
Where's Julian Smith yelling "try my hot Koolaid" when you need him
Never been this early in my life....
Was about to go to sleep (5 am where I'm from) but sleep is for the weak, right? xD
Also, the title song for the game is beautiful 👌
Cold clam chowder
Hesecaia seemed like a strange man 😬
Will it monster Mask!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏
NGL, when Rhett said “We love you” I cracked a smile.
it molten banana
Hot Guacamole is really good
gasps as the conjelled fat and almost vomits I'ma textural person, textures matter to me. This makes me anxious.
‘i dont think thats broth ‘( ° ͜ʖ °)
You guys should try piping hot chunky applesauce. So good.
THE WHEEL INTRO MADE ME SO HAPPY
5:09 “it’s not broth” Rhett ok I’m glad I wear headphones
Yeah we do these things in Switzerland
My brain isn’t supposed to hurt at 7 in the morning.
I havent watched yet i hope you do hot dogs cold
That bone broth convo tho
shoudlve did cold pop-tart and hot cereal
Hot banana split looks just like what we call "kolak" here in Indonesia 😂
5:11 Feelings were hurt lol
12:90 52% never drank alcohol before.
All the Swiss references lol
Hot Red Bull is another experience
coffee?
Best ending ever haha

"That was not necessary."
You use to bulk buy big Macs and freeze them?!
6:19 banana foster
A cold whopper for breakfast is the best tbh
Hey yall I just got my new phone!!
☆ ⌒ ★ ⌒ ☆ ⌒ ★ ⌒ ☆ ⌒ ★ ⌒ ☆ Good Mythical Monday Morning
Sitting down with a nice glass of spossle ready to enjoy some GMM.
your reading us like a book XD
Would have been cool if you had done hot Dr. Pepper though.  Blast from the Past movie reference, y'know?
LOVE THE INTRO
Pizza can sometimes be better cold
Rhett reminds me so much of Ron Swanson from parks and recreation
6:25 humans accidently discovering one of the most importaint uses of heat to help speeding up evolution.
there's a reason people did so well at voting... they CLEARLY tested them all. that explains when the whopper and the banana split was almost 50/50, they agreed and voted accordingly.
This had to be the best intro song ever!!😍😎
What's with the Swiss?
I kept replaying the game theme song
“That’s real tough to do.”
wish u could come to Germany :(
That half a cold hot pocket on Link's shoulder had me scream laughing 🤣
5:04 family appropriate
The positive talking reminds me of John Cenas positive talking
Literally link needs to quit and pursue his singing career, that game show song tho
I loved their inspirational words to us at the end. So cute and funny. 🥰🥰🥰
Who consumes bone broth by itself at any temperature? That is an ingredient.
Hot Gatorade is pretty bomb
What kind of shampoo do you use
Has rhett ever even met a swiss person? 😂
Why is link always so rough? Look at how he freaking unwrapped the whopper 😂😂
In Ireland, Warm Sprite/7up is an old tradition to help with an upset stomach! Its not weird to me having growing up with it
Today we learn that the Swiss are known for consuming a wide variety of hot foods.
okay melted ice scream is good!
I discovered good mythical morning and good mythical more about two weeks ago and now I watch it everyday I can’t get enough of it 
I love Rhett and Link 💕 💖 💗
I cant even begin to imagine what hot guac would be like
I'd imagine a cold hot Pocket would be like a cold piece of pizza?
Man that intro song for the segment
Y'all think that's the first time Link's said, "I'll go all the way?'
I like the new intro but I like the old one
Link can really sing!
I eat cold ravioli all the time. Yep...really gross thinking about it.
Why is Rhett obsessed with the Swiss?
Well no duh hot bananas dessert... In fact in many tropical countries like Philippines and etc. We eat hot plantain dessert or even bbq bananas always...
5:05 “it’s not broth”
Feel bad for link with the bone jokes. Hits hard my guy
i need to go to sleep its 5:22am in texas and i have not slept
What's with the Swiss, Rhett?
Was worried the dude on the lawn mower might take a spill lol. I was thinking, any second now the video is going to hard cut to him running from the lawn mower.
I got 3 right .
“I’m a hot cole slaw in the sheets”🤮
LOL. I'm in Switzerland Basel eating lunch and feeling totally inspired. Thx guys. 😀
I GOT THEM RIGHT! I'm psychic!
Lol, them predicting that we are predicting them.
Sweet foods salty vs salty foods sweet
Iced Coffee > Hot coffee
Loved the motivation 👍🏻😂
I don't know if its an Australia thing or maybe it's just the people I know. But we eat cold Whoppers regularly, they're the best burger to have cold. Sometimes I buy whoppers just to have them cold.
Why did I get a weird swinger vibe @ 4:56? Lol geezzz
McChickens are much better cold than they are warm.
6:49 That's what she said
Nah Rhett, i was at a music festival in Switzerland a few years ago. When we went from the camping area to the stage area we left a half full bottle of sprite in the sun. It was VERY hot that day.
Later that day my friend accidentally took a really big gulp of the hot, and now flat, sprite. Judging by his facial expressions and the noises he made it wasn't very nice.
Prime example: Cold Pizza is 1000× better than Hot
I like cold Taco Bell burritos
That is banana soup
Good mythical lunchtime from Norway, guys! 😄 Hope you all have a good day! 🇳🇴❤️
Ice coffee for the win
Eating a cold Whopper is one of my favorite things. I actually prefer a cold Whooper over a hot one.
I eat cold clam chowder all the time it's better than hot
I had a cold hot pocket before and it's gross
Stevie: What should we do today?
Link: Let's put a whopper with cheese in a freezer!
Rhett: Lets put sprite in a microwave!
Chase: (ignores Link) Great idea Rhett!
Burger King is almost better cold.
come to harrisburg pennsylvania!!! So many of my friends and I love your show!
YOOO I REALLY LIKED HOW INTERACTIVE THIS EPISODE WAS. Jussayin I would really love to see more Fan interaction games like this!!!
link's grin after the game song!!
I have this weird thing where I find milk and quac absolutely disgusting if they aren't ice cold. Just thinking about warm milk can make me gag....
As a Hawaiian living in Switzerland, there constant Switzerland jokes are so weird haha
When you let hot food sit there a while...a lot of the times it let's the flavors sink in more...that's why when I'm feeling hot or sick, I'll eat soup, burgers, chicken and stuff cold...as I can taste it more...the texture might be the only iffy part for all of that, though.
when they put the poll on, i thought they meant hot as in “spicy”...
Yay fans win 😄😄
I can’t decide is a cold hot pocket is just an oxymoron or a sin against humanity.
1:54 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
They are really scraping the bottom of the barrel for these topics nowadays aren't they
I haven't made it yet, but, I'm definitely one day going to make it...hopefully before I'm 40..
Who watches GMM every morning?
Love the fluffy beard Rhett 😘
You say a mans not guac
Martini can be served hot
My favorite is hot tea with cold pizza mmmmmmmmm so goooood 😋😋😋💖💖💖💖💖💖

Honestly... I like cold pizza.
13:00
14:06
i prefer cold burgers and cold pizza
The hot Sprite I have experienced. Left a Sprite in my car in summer
Idk why but I stopped watching u guys a few months ago and the views were down, now I'm hooked up again and I was impressed that the videos were around 1 - 2 mill. Nice
Cold Pizza 💯 better!
Ok but that actually made me feel so much better. I’ve been having a bad day💖
I'm swiss and i can confirm!
cold eggs, Hot guac, cookin up dope in the crock pot 1:37
Only the Swiss disliked this video
I listen to Link sing that and I cannot remember which song that is. But I heard it before......
Do a game where you can see who can carry more groceries (measure by lbs) and have all the groceries in the car like you do when you have to bring them into the house.
This episode is really cool! Love the fan points. So neat! Hope you guys do something like this again! ❤️
fun fact: in the Netherlands there is a hot lemonade called kwast and its actually quite nice in the winter.
Suddenly i want spocill
I can’t even get Burger King where I live because they got sued by their own company and I miss it.
Burger King is underrated
I love cold coffee, well, coffee that’s meant to be cold, like a frappe
You should make a playlist of all the songs before a test of the full version
Waited tell I got home tonight to watch this.  Best decision ever, hilarious of course exactly what I needed!
First comment?
Dip or soup? Lol
Rhett just liked everything...
Only 15M they deserve more
Cold ghost pepper vs drinking boiling nitrogen
Notification squad ☝️‼️
Hot Sprite....Sprot
How you guys make these segments work I'll never know, you guys are hilarious especially Rhett
My grandpa always makes something he calls a bananas foster which is basically a hot banana split. It's really good
if you grew up impatient like me, the center of the hot pocket was always cold anyway
is there someone else here that comes from switzerland?🇨🇭
Is it okay that im watching this at night
If the word ''like'' was never invented, I don't know what they would do! 😂
Sok2an hot banana split, itumah kolek
Dessert Soups is a big thing in Asia
Hey GMM, you have influence at a critical time in history. Please use it wisely. We're experiencing ecosystem collapse and climate breakdown on an unprecedented scale. An incredible effort is needed to transform our energy over the next decade or we will face irreversible calamity. Please focus your priorities.
Loved the intro!
My teeth would be like REEEEEEEHHT
that intro tho yassss
Anybody else see those two martinis like they’re some kind of Madonna-style cone bra on Link at the end? Lol
6:30 in Philippines we called it "BENIGNET". we mostly eat it during holy week.
I love you too Rhett!!!
lol I loved the song it was so cool
The ending of this video was pure gold. Felt like you were talking to my soul lol
I‘m from Switzerland😄🙋🏻‍♀️ and I can tell ya we are weird but not that weird that we would drink hot sprite😂
What song was the intro for the video based of?
I always eat my burgers cold, makes em way better.
video title: wait a minute what the shi
" you know why its not bad, because its not" 7:12
BEST SONG INTRO EVER. I want to hear a full version plssssseeee
Why the heck does Rhett keep mentioning the Swiss
You can make it.
You're going to make it.
You HAVE made it!
Say the title 3 times fast
UMMM the first two are actually not bad....
Warm martinis?!? No alcohol is good warm
A thick cut of cold ham is pretty nice(cooked then refrigerated)
hot cold warm medium temperature food
What was the intro song, the like, parody thing. What was it?
6:44 there are two kinds of people 😂
todoroki rly snapped here
I had to replay for Katy Perry's parody. :D
I love he mythical crew because they just do not hold back on what they provide to Rhett and link.
I don’t know why but I lost it when Rhett said “One of my favorite childhood snacks, the vodka martini”
I like the introduction to the challenge, very creative
Cold coffee (and not an ice coffee, Just straight up cold coffee, it’s the bomb 👌🏻)
That intro graphic was on fire 🔥
11:18
Link: Do you like it cold, is all that matters here tho
Rhett: Yeh
Lol why was that so funny
You guys and your inappropriate jokes make me so uncomfortable🤣🤣🤣
Giving her bone broth....I thought this was a family show. Not that I'm complaining xD
It got kinda weird there towards the end..
I love how they haven’t changed over the years
I sometimes eat cold hot pockets 😂
I have an exam tomorrow I should stop watching YouTube videos. 😂😢
That's not how you eat a hot pocket 😓
Finally, cold lettuce on a Whopper
This gave me a mbmam hot grapes flashback
Hot N Cold (GMM Cover) it wasn't that bad actually
In Ireland we use hot 7up or sprite to treat almost any illness 🤦‍♂️ got a cold - warm 7up, got a headache - warm 7up
I neeeds more fancy fast fooods
14:23 is my digital media teacher 😁
xD I got them all right
Who liked rhetts jacket? I did
if you like hot banana split, you should really come to malaysia and find "pengat pisang"

it's basically hot banana and coconut milk desert
Is it me or did Rhet talk too much in this one
This fye❄️
Those stickers Look sick bruh!
Time to spin the wheel of mythicality
Sometimes I like eating chicken cold , anyone else?
they honestly have a higher pitch than a fifth grade in-puberty-boy
I’m pretty sure warm coleslaw is a thing already
Cold hot pockets arent that bad
I LOVED the last part!
they should have dipped the cold whopper in the hot banana split 🔥🔥🔥🔥
14:07 I needed this
Colld Chikingnugits and. Cold supe
im disappointed there wasnt the old "that was my nickname in highschool" when Link said "coagulated mayonnaise"
Oh lawd, hot cold pockets 😰
Hot 7up/Sprite is the perfect thing when you're sick! Growing up, my parents would boil 7up for me when I was sick.
I highly recommend it!
Hot pocket would be the same😂
Rhett’s like a cave man, he’ll eat basically everything and enjoy it
Nothing is good cold
5:09 😂😂😂😂 guys I'm dying
What if the people who voted haven’t tried martini’s before ? I think that justifies the response/prediction
Cold left over pizza, I cant be the only one
The ending was therapeutic.
Hot icy
Is there a compilation of Link balancing food on his shoulder somewhere?
I was pretty impressed when link sang in the beginning XD
Cold is only better with deserts and drinks
In indonesia we have an actual dessert that's kinda similar to hot banana split. It's called kolak and it's a hot mixture of coconut milk and palm sugar with bananas/yams/sweet potatoes.
Cooked avocado is already a thing. so that's probably why you liked it
13:08 when you really need that watch time
🎶Ive got cold eggs and hot guac,
She got more leg than i got glocks🎶
Todoroki be like
it’s not broth
The end bit was so freaking awkward
Rhett: eats food
Rhett: eats another food
Rhett: "I like both of these"
summary of Rhett Mclaughlin everyone
Had a rough day at work and I actually really appreciate the inspiration at the end.
You guys need some Whataburger in your lives💁🏼‍♀️
9:33 Link 100% thought Rhett said banging
Ok but why did "you're going to make it" suddenly have me emotional
When you warm mayonnaise it gets spoiled. You make coleslaw with mayonnaise... you guys are 🤢!!
Cold boiled eggs are actually pretty good
Why didn't you guys let the intern use a microwave ?
Dat intro
Yeah I figured the coleslaw would work better hot than chowder cold. My grandma is from the maritimes, so I am used to fish dishes and... Yeah chowder NEVER works well cold

Meanwhile the coleslaw I felt would be kind of like Kimchi in some ways? Not to mention all those ingredients... You can get on a HOT burger
wouldn't it just be a pocket?
XD "Its not bone broth"
That hot banana split is just a soup we Filipinos call "Binignit"
Crack slaw. It has sausage and coleslaw
TIL that I've been waiting my whole life to hear Link say "coagulated mayonnaise"
Well we lost the martini one because most of your audience are kids
Intro song?
I have been watching your show for 4 years 😁😎
Wish they did a mac n cheese edition, grown up style... 😆
So fast. Much Notif
I'd be just about as useful as Rhett is in a taste test. My family doesn't trust my judgement on food because I just think everything is delicious lol.
5:10 “it’s not broth” you wild rhett
Can we talk about how good they look today?
anyone else almost have a stroke trying to read the title
Yay first like what a great way to start the week Haha goodmorning  yall
DID NOT understand the title at all until you repeated it back to me. Thanks Rhett! Lol.
cold pizza is the best
It seems like its not hot versus cold, but whatever is sweeter wins
The heck flavor hot pocket was that.
GOOD MYTHICAL MORNIG LADS!
That's funny was I your intern JK
For every time Rett and Link stutter take a shot
Is it spoßel? Or spaußel?
How hot was the hot sprite?
Surely thats just bananas and custard?
Blind pickle taste test! I need to know which is the best pickel!!!
We need the mythical mail boulder back 😭
“ brother, please drink the hot kool-aid”
Marketing hot sprite as "spawsel" wouldn't go over well in Belgium. In flemish dialect it means "puke" ("spauwsel").
Any Texans watching this now? I like cold pizza, and love to drink sizzling hot coffee. What's everyones favorite hot and cold food/drink?
My name is hezekiah  but that  would not be my breakfast lol
I feel like Filipino people would eat a hot banana split sundae
When the guy with beard eats all i see is a beard going up and down
I personally like cold food. Idk why
6:45-6:50 two types of people to open a burger 😂😂
Cold pizza for breakfast is the best
hot kool aid
I love these guys so much
Cold hot pockets taste nothing like cold pizza 🤢
I learned so much about the Swiss today. 😂
I actually like cold clam chowder
That intro song tho
For some reason I love frozen uncrustables
Is your tour coming to New Jersey because I’ve gone once when I was on vacation in Chicago but never since
5:10 I’ve never seen Link say “such your mouth” with more murderous intent than he did just then.
This video is cursed
That Coleslaw doesn't look appetizing
They are really toeing the line with the innuendos
Who eats hot pockets like that!!!??
Isn't a cold hot pocket what always happens anyways? Hot af on the outside and cold as ice on the inside.
Why does Rhett smell things before he eats them?😂❤️
So no ones gonna mention the intern who cooked hot pockets in his PANTS then eats it!?????
Cold. I will eat anything cold. Leftovers always cold. I will eat cold lasagna, chicken wings, stuffing. Obviously cold pizza is great.
I would have listened to the entire song of the food version Katy Perry remix!
Diggin’ Rhett’s outfit today.
i can see how the whopper would be good! :D
Hot sprite or hot seven up is just a sick stomach remedy here! Quite nice!
Why is no one else concerned about how they ate those hot pockets!?
We knew everything
Can't wait to hear that intro song on LTAT.
And this is why i love these guys
Rhett & Link would not like Japanese sake (alcohol), as it is traditionally served hot
you look a little like him som pretty little liars (toby)
I am from Scotland and have only had guacamole 2 or 3 times and it has always been hot i had never even considered cold guacamole is that just a Scottish thing or does that happen anywhere else 😅
I'm supposed to be asleep right now.
You guys are so funny thank you
Stop by my burger king ill give yall a warm wopper
WILL IT POTATO SALAD?
Where's the Notification Squad at?
Okay but Belgium waffles and blueberries are way better frozen
Rhett is hilarious today.
LA Beast fans are also the Mythical Beasts.
How did Link eat the hot pocket so fast?
Stevie: It's better than you giving her bone broth."
Rhett: "...It's not broth."
the only thing that tastes good cold is water
Link: you like a Martuni? Did I just say Martuni ??? Oh Link the gold I find in each episode of GMM.  I played that back like 15 times and each time I laughed more and more.
5:04 weeehehe that got a litttttle heted
I have not eaten hot pockets in 2 years😫
Wait, when are we getting the #Shando episode routine?
Pizza is the one food that i refuse to eat cold(aside from some types of pasta, and also french fries)
DO you do the questions on twitter or just Insta?  I don't do Insta 😢. Reach more fans post on Twitter please.
that ending though
0:44 your welcome
man the last part got me all emotional when they said "you can make it " cause i have spent all day thinking about how im gonna fail my exams and stressing about it.. really helped tbh
Thought the cold clam chowder was going to be better.
Cold burger is better imo
Can’t wait to see you guys in June
What kinda weird JOI does this become 13:20
3 views! never been so fast, where i beat the notification too!
this is the only time rhett and link have actually received hot food on the show
Can we just appreciate when they make songs or parody for game names
It’s not called a hot Pocket any more it is called a cold pocket now
i love u guys
I guess it's a cold pocket now....

Heh hehheh hhh 
I'll leave
Additional poll option: "Rhett likes both"
Let’s talk about that
Hot pockets are EXTREMELY disgusting cold, in my opinion.
Hot food cold is better. Cold pizza, wings, and takeout.
IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY 💖
Hot coleslaw on a hotdog!
I love melted ice cream
Am I the only one who came here from Instagram?
Notification SQUAD =)
Bad test. Half the hot things were filled with sugar
You should air this stuff onntv at 7:00-9:00 so ppl can watch it with breakfast
Denim Daddies
I drink hot sprite when I'm sick because it soothes your throat and makes my stomach feel better. I actually don't really like cold sprite though. lol
I'm a simple man.
I see a GMM video.
I click.
I think the beat part is 14:57
Come to Toronto!
What a great show  guys... great idea!
5:05 NOOOO STEVIE WHY’d YOU HAVE TO GO THERE 😭😭😂😂😂 poor Link
Last Week Of GMM Season 15!!!
slossle, man
I predict that link will shake his arm
Tokyo
Tyler from Oklahoma is a true hero like straight up. He’s positive mental attitude and energy just was the cherry on top of the video. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen someone so happy to drive a lawnmower
if you like that hot banana split, you should try the Vietnamese dessert called chè chuối. It's kinda like a banana split, but with coconut milk and tapioca pearls
#HOTGUAC
I used to eat cold hotpockets all the time. Any of the ones that could be pizza (pepperoni, meatball, etc) are great cold/frozen, especially in the summer.
Rhett reminds me of Ian Malcom from jp
Do you wonder if Rhett's getting tired of Link saying "Dink it"?
Is that jacket an Elwood jacket?
is it weird that i prefer my mcdonalds quarter pounder with cheese, not only plain (no condiments, tomato, or lettuce), but also fairly cold
Yes, I like my hot pockets cold too.
If you haven’t seen the video yet, 13:58 is what your in for
Can Brian Hull be in one of your videos. He does impression so can you make my dreams come true.
What a tongue twister 😛
i had an aneurysm reading the title
cant even see the comments. looks at time. IM EARLY
Mom you’re like a cold whopper to me 😂👍
I eat my salads warm.
Can you guys do an entire video, tasting korean fire noodles by the brand Samyang? They just released a nuclear mini which is more spicier than the original fire noodle, and also more spicier than the 2x nuclear noodle they already had 🙏🙏🙏
Nobody:

Rhett: You know when the Swiss...
Should’ve done “cold fries with hot ketchup”
Why would they like bone broth to begin with?? That one was an easy sprite win
I like this interactive-ness
The last bit😂
Wouldn’t a cold hot pocket just be a pocket?? 😂
Hot Slaw is a thing
The hot banana split is already a thing if you go to hola Mexican restaurant order the flaming bananas it’s amazing!
If you really like all hot foods than eat Hot Sushis lmao
I am watching Good Mythical Morning during the evening. Fight me.
The leyend says that is you see a GMM video early they like your comment
Try it with chicken
the thermometers on the thumbnails look like lightsabers
Yay Ear Biscuits! !
I never microwave leftovers and I find it so much better that way tbh and my family finds it weird
I’m here so early 3 views 50 likes and 15 comments
Can you do a vegan cheese vs regular cheese episode?
#GOTGUAC
Really bothers me the way you guys ate those hot pockets
The people who follow the GMM Twitter are probably the people who know what they like, more than the rest of us at least.
Your shows should come in Netflix
Before the jingle I thought to myself: “They HAVE to do a Katy Perry parody song of Hot and Cold it would be PERFECT” 
When I heard the song I was so happy it was great and funny, you guys deserve a like just for that :)
at least the hot pocket wasn't still frozen when you bit into it.  LOL.
I'm so jealous of you having hot pockets! Why did they get rid of them in the UK? :(
This was like one of the best tasting vid they did because they didn't really dislike any of them.
I’ve never been more inspired in my life.
This is a pretty bizarre thing to do with your food and drinks! 🤔😁👍
Rhett's shirt: Free Kodak
Hot banana split looks like our binignit.. lol
I don’t associate with this
5:04 I had to pause for a minute just to laugh cuz it's exactly what I was thinking and this totally went over all the kids heads here. 🤣
What age range was that bit intended for I feel like it was like watching dora
They should do a will it hot pocket episode
What about hot ice!? It’s the best of both worlds.
So one of my most favorite things in the world is to buy 2 whoppers with cheese and get them cold in the fridge before I eat them haha.
Legend has it if your this early you comment gets liked or pinned ! Wonder if its true?
“Ummmm that was not necessary “....
I love hot sprit
Egg rolls better be on here
I have my last exam of my finals in two days and your motivational speech has given me strength.
The trendiest "adults" I know lol
8:45 Qween Sweep
I guessed them all right
I love this
The names are getting way better
I miss the old GMM
im at the hot sprite part, and im admiring Rhett's ability to come up with a back story for how he feels about the thing XDDD
How about a shake fries comparison. Example. McFlurry and fries dipped together against Wendy’s frosty and fries!!?!?!   Credit me!!!
My mum loves hot sprite, she drinks it all winter
#stoplinkabuse
What's with you guys and us Swiss man?
Do a would you rather again!!
I've had hot alcohol before... It's rough. If you've got the constitution for it, that's cool, but I don't think a martini is supposed to be a hot toddy or anything like that
Guacahottie is a better name.
That outro made me feel like I was on mushrooms omg I’m laughing so hard
wassel is water in german. dont ask
My last 3 brain cells be like:
Omg I wanted to Pitch this idea to them I’m glad it’s become a reality
Link haha
Video starts 1:38
Yes we do... @10:36
great idea gmm team!
Rashers of bacon, not slices.
Do "cooked uncooked food vs uncooked cooked food"
When it's late and the microwave would wake people up. Who hasnt had a cold whopper. I mean really.
****************************
Cold pockets... oh my god. It's real.
There is no such thing as too big of a breakfast
Cold pizza is the best!🍕
Filthy martinis taste like ocean water 🤢
they totally swing.
Dry grapes vs wet rasins
Link said shut ya mouth
What I learned today is that Rhett is happy to eat just about anything.
A frozen waffle is pretty nice to gnaw on tbh
Damn it I needed that...
At 0:43 the song got stuck on my head
For some reason I imagined Rhett with a ponytail this entire video.
I would probably prefer hot cold food
i think you should go back to the old theme song
What’s with all the Swiss?
nice hairline
Slawcil- eat it hot!
Steak is the best cold hot food.
I knew they would like cold food hot more. Because when I heard "cold food hot" I imagined melted ice cream. And who doesn't love that?... And when I heard "hot food cold", I imagined congealed fat. And who tf likes THAT?
Hot bannana split seems like a good topper for hot fudge brownies
I just watched Katy Perry’s hot n cold before this!
Do y'all eat your potato salad cold or hot? I like it best when it's warm right after you finish it . But it's great either way
....Todoroki
Wow how did I get them all right 😂 😰 I think I’m dying! I never get it all right in anything
Queen sweep
Is a cold hot pocket a sandwich?

Fried eggs taste better if you actually cook the yolk.

I remember voting in this but I can't for the life of me remember which ones I voted for.
I have never been so motivated and confused.
Well helloooo Tyler.. swoon
Lol did any other New Englander just get wicked disappointed that they didn't like the cold chowder?
It's called stock guys
HOT KOOLAID!!!!!!
Thats the best title they have made in years
Hot wopper
i wonder what w.c. fields would think of hot martini
Good god.. give her bone broth.
If a hot  pocket is cold would it be a cold pocket???
Uno reverse
Right before the end with the guy on the lawnmower I was thinking “it’d be neat if it was someone from Oklahoma” and what the heck
Is it bad that i sorta wanna hear the bad sound? 😂
After watching mini gmm  you can see the similarities between the fathers and sons
I've never had a hot Whopper lol
Hot sprite
why.
hot dr. pepper is bad
11:10
hot foods are noice
I'm waiting on the cold hot chocolate
The reason all the hot foods taste better is because the heat from the food numbs you taste buds making them more durable to bad tasting foods as for the cold food the bad taste is coming at full power
But they both still love eating food tho
Is it just me or did Link get T R I G G E R D at 5:11 😂
i like this video idea!
😄
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
What is gross is store bought iced tea served hot.
funny, I think I ate hot pocket but not necessary peperoni
Im sick, but i refuse to miss an episode of GMM.
Do foods
Can i have some slosoul
Kinda living for the theme song for this bit 😂Katy perry would be proud
Yayy
Given the ages that I imagined voted, I doubt they have had cold martini's, let alone hot ones!
Flag this, there's heatism
Thank you
🇨🇭
Who thought he was rapping 0:27
Is It Still A Hot Pocket If It’s Cold?
Dirtier the better! Couldn’t agree more!!
“Shutcha mouth” 😂😂😂😂😂
Hot coleslaw wasn't all that surprising. If you've ever had a pulled pork sandwich with slaw on it, that's basically the same thing.
6:30
what ever happened to song biscuits? i used to listen to that on repeat, man
Do food non foods taste better than non food foods??
That song sounded better than the real thing
The martinis make link look like hes wearing a bikini top. Just me?
Whoppers i get are always cold
Do these guys live in America or Switzerland?
I like cold food. The only thing i like hot is ramen. Haha XD
I would drink hot tea&hot coffee the the cold thing I would eat is cereal
The thing is, I don’t care whether food is hot or cold. Food is food.
It’s actually common with some people to drink hot Dr. Pepper with a slice of lemon. It’s a lot like tea!
Rhett kinda looks like Chris Evans
Dry hot or dry cold or wet hot or wet cold?
Cold smores,cold cake,cold doughnuts
Hot pocket hot
Hot pocket cold
Hot pocket in the pot 9 days old

Some like it hot
Some like it cold
Some like it in the pot 9 days old
What's so hot it's cool and so cool it's hot!
I need friends.
Hot sprite
I do like warm bread pudding myself.
Since I’m inspired and we’re that great, lemme get a job pls
how do you guys make such great game names???
The hot banana split reminds me of a similar Filipino dessert called Paradosdos or Ginataang Bilo-bilo. It’s a hot soupy dessert with some bilo-bilo, sago, plantain or sweet potato in it. It’s really good :)
I like cold corn chowder.
I luv u
I feel like the end is a secret message to someone...oO
Fans: hot! Always hot!
Heyyy! New intro sense I was here! I watched this as I was a kid! (I’m 16)
Hot bowl of cereal is really good, it might seem like a sin at first until you try it on a cold rainy night it's like a warm hug.
Quesoritos are good cold with sour cream
Where does this voting happen?? I want to vote too lol
Well to be fair half of ur audience are under 18 so they don’t know what a martini taste like. They will think it’s a sugary drink but it’s not 😂😂😂
would totally eat the cold burger  and the cold hot pocket
I work with a guy who puts hotdogs in his pockets and eat them like the guy with the hot pocket
Hot Slaw does exist.
I shall dub thee hotsprite
What over shirt is Rhett wearing?
the Buger King near me always has cold food
We all know who's sleeping on the couch tonight*cough* cough Rhett*cough*
They really had to make the whole video awkward
“I’m a cold clam chowder in the streets, and a hot coleslaw in the sheets”
11:16
They gotta do this again
You guys need to make a compilation video of all the it’s time for intros lol
The song though
I drown my martinis in olive brine. If it ain't sweet from the vermouth, herbal from the gin and salty from the olives then i ain't drinkin it.
I'm sorry but them referencing Migos and soundcloud rappers screams fellow kids
youresoloud will have fun with this one
4:42
I had hot soda
I haven't seen gmm ion ages
I can't even imagine hot ice cream
Come play Vancouver pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssseeeeeee
Do you guys record in the moring?
#hotfood
I hope you used Duke’s in that coleslaw. Just saying.
Martunie
What did we learn today kids? Rhett likes eating.

Not news lol
I freakin love you guys. You just make my day ;_; I can watch you continuously till the apocalypse ;_;

Ps. I have a major test tomorrow. But here I'm ;_; lord save me
Link:*automatically checks burger for tomatoes*
Hot gatorade is SO good! You guys missed a gem
That end bit, god damn 😂😂😂😂
A hot banana split is like bananas foster without the caramel and butter
Please react to some anime,plz
Boi they get the most random topics and good editors and boom you got GMM
Oh boy...these two are gonna be wide awake tonight
rhett be lookin hip today!
Who else re-played the game title 100 times
Who else wanted to hear the sounds
I got 3 right cause I really thought they would like the hot martini
scrambled   not sunny side up, might be ok
They should have made hot Kool aid I MADE THIS FOR YOU
Actually the hot banana split is called "Kolak" in Indonesia, and yes we do eat that, and it's delicious
I love cold food 🥶
Ever try fried ice cream before? It's good!
What have you bring to this curse land
This is school food
Wheel of Mythicality needs a spot that says “Rhett and Link Reenact the first time they saw the end of six sense”
This was... 








an experience
Best. Jingle. Ever.
warm sprite is amazing. fight me
It is a really confusing end. Typing while sitting in switzerland xD
The ending...
I can’t believe the person who said let’s spin the weal of mythicality wasn’t from Switzerland
The game intro was well done 10/10
Was seriously getting nauseous at the thought of hot coleslaw...
I wish I could be more like Rhett and just love everything
Obviously cold food hot
You know when these Swiss.....
You guys should do a tour in ireland
kinda like, a lot of people like warm Dr. Pepper
Cold pizza is the best pizza
This might be gross but one day the microwave oven didn't work and it was summer so I ate a frozen hot pocket
Comment
Lol.😂 the hot and your cold song.😂
The was so funny
Hot cold sodas, and cold hot popcorn
Well,I'm not in Switzerland anymore since beginning of 2017 but thanks haha
‪HotGuacamole‬ is my favorite twitter account
the game names r my favorite
I love that Katy Perry intro
A Swiss what?? I live in Switzerland... Wait... Am I missing something???
Thanks for making Monday’s tolerable :)
I am so inspired. I'm enlightened. 😂
Guys "hot sprite" is not Swiss it is Luxenounrgian.... LOL 🐲
Should have done hot 7up. That's actual medicine in Ireland
Nobody gonna talk about the intro?😭
I had a really bad day today but for some reason that inspirational ending made me feel a lot better <3
Trending!!
i don't know why they keep doing food related contests since rhett just loves all foods lol
I needed that
I know from experience that cold Whoppers are pretty yummy
Hot guac isn't necessarily new. I make fettuccini with cooked avacado sauce for dinner sometimes.
They should've known it was gonna be cold hot Pocket it's like cold pizza
The Hot Sundae just reminds me of the look of Ginataang Halo Halo (a Philippine dessert)
I wonder how Rhett and Link will survive in the next ice age with only cold foods
We all should try frozen smackers pb&j sandwich. It tastes like Recess cups
Who here has ever had a cold cheeseburger knowing that it would be way better warmed up by you just keep eating it
You just invented all new Rhett and Link “ Banana Soup”
rice krispy (HOT) > Rice Krispy (Cold)
Cold whoppers r the best🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
The Switz-a-roo
These foods are great cold
Pizza
Lasagna
It's funny how Link said "No chips, just using a spoon". That's the best way,  so the taste of the chip does not interfere with the heavenly taste of the guac. ¡OLE!
You know when the swiss...
Brother. Drink. My. Hot. Kool aid.
Cold hot pockets are so good
Rhett comeon now
Who eats a hot pocket like that?
The hot banana spilt should be called "banana sploup"
I'm going to start flippin the temps on my everyday meals. Surprise my taste and stomach a bit hahahahahahaha
Hot slav ... yeah
4:59
They have something like hot potato salad in Germany
I swear GMM is so uplifting!
anyone else like cold bananas?
******************************** *
We finally won a gmm game! Great team effort! #BYMB
6:50 thats what she said
Soucamole -Soup + Guac
I actually prefer eating whoppers cold...
So Rhett likes em all... ok


And then there is link
We predict you both are goofy.
I think the hot Sprite should be called Sprong! Cold Sprite is RIGHT and Hot Sprite is Sp-wrong!!
You just sayed it?? Like what
I love you guys!!
Rhett literally likes everything.
Most foods that are meant to be cold can make you sick if let to be warm
Yo look at Rhett when they open the burger packeting he said nothing 😂😂 my mans was ready to eat
10:00 dog food
Maybe if the Martinis were stirred and not shaken they would have liked them.
Wait, so you are telling me that it is not normal to eat clam chowder cold?? 😨
Hot slaw is a real old recipe, saw it in a 1700’s cookbook
I would predict that the horrible sounds would've been a combination of Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Luke Brian, and Nightcore put together.
How are these two guys so entertaining. Seriously
Is it just me or does anyone else think that Rhett is Ron Swanson
I think it’s cuz hot usually means “just cooked and fresh” while cold means “old leftovers”
Today is my birthday so this is a great present!
OMG THAT INTRO SONG HAHAHAHHA
Loving this format 🤣
Literally eating a cold whopper while watching 😂
Yes! #HOT-AMOLE
Your Jedi mindtrick worked on me
Take the 'Will it?' concept and apply it to things other than foods. The food stuff has been getting stale for a while now, no pun intended. 

Potential 'Will its':

Will it baseball bat?
Will it tire?
Will it hockey puck?
Interesting concept could just be "will it heat"
I always liked cold burgers
Pasta and Pizza cold is amazing
Great concept👍🏼
"You know why it's not bad? Because it's not"
Späsl 👌🏼
I’m from Switzerland and this really made my day! You guys are awesome.
You guys have to come tour Canada! Or at least a few cities!
I actually wamted to barf with  The hot colslaw
what?
They may not like it hot, but the important question is, do they like it shaken or stirred?
Should of added  hot and cold syrup
Cold Whoppers are good! I like them hot too but when I have extras in the fridge I just eat them like that cause I don't like the idea of microwaving mayonnaise lol.
I was really watching hard wanting that clean sweep across the board 😂
remake the unicorn rap
Stevie said what we were all thinking...
Rhett's been lookin real depressed lately, you ok man?
I read the front pic of this vid 6 times!!! 6!!! And i read it cold hot rocket every time! I think im going insane
I LISTEN TO EAR BISCUITS AS I DO YARDWORK TOO
Morning alcohol!!! How dare you.
That song at the beginning gets a solid 10!
The banana split almost made me throw up.
I loved how rhett just opened his whopper nice and neatly and link just pulled on the wrapper and made a mess
70% of the time the whoppers are served COLD. TELL THE CREW TO PUSH THE WHOPPER BUTTON.
Hot food. Noice. pop
Cold hot pocket, is kinda like cold pizza. Still good lol
Hot banana split = kolak pisang
pause at 6:49, thats what she said
swissmush
Are we just going to gloss over how awesome Link sounded with the title song?
This has to be a joke, warm condiments taste fine. Coleslaw on warm chicken sandwich is good. Guacamole on warm Mexican Food is great.
Boys, hentai haven is back up
I use hot sprite, 1 spoon of manuka honey, 1 juice from a lemon and 2 ibuprofen tablets as a remedy for colds, works every single time. The sugar gives you energy, the lemon vitamin c and the ibuprofen fixes the headache and any kind of pain, the honey is good for your stomach and soothes your throat :)
I got 5/5 guesses lol
The Mythical Beast army is too young to know how BAD hard liquor tastes warm. 😂😂
temperature doesn't change flavor
I like the audience incorporation
I used to work in a restaurant where, for some reason, the sugar packets were locked up like gold at Fort Knox. So I'd always use Sprite as my sweetener when I made tea. It was actually really tasty. Especially because lemon is a classic pairing for tea anyway.
I’ve been doing good on this
I love you guys😭💕
I enjoy cold burgers and pizza
To many youngsters here that voted for the Hot Martini, they've never had alcohol in their life, haha
All I can think about with this episode is Hot Cold Sodas, and Cold Hot Popcorn right now, in the projection booth.
yall need some tempura ice cream in your lives
Bad rhett!
The hot banana split looks like benegnet
Is martini a food?
I swear its an Drink..?
I like all my dessert cold...frozen rather.
I didn't hear what they said at the start about us having our Award and what it was can you please comment and say what they said
Isn’t hot sprite totally a thing?
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
please stop addressing me directly
Is this what Todoroki eats?
The Katy Perry parody was really good!
every carne asada burrito has Hot Guac.   lol   
and we all eat boiled eggs cold.
I was disappointed that Rhett didn't try to catch the fish with granddaddy lmao
The chowder/coleslaw round was so rough for me to watch. 🤢
Haven't see Jordan in awhile :(
No cold pizza has left me disappointed
Lmao the disrespect
best song
Did anyone else have a hard time convincing their brain that what they were eating was truly hot or cold?
the big breakfast analogy was so good because that's exactly what happens i eat all the good stuff then have one egg left over and its cold by the time i get to it
My theory on why cold hot pocket lost was since this is an all ages show the wild card is the under 21 year old beasts that have a higher probability of having a dissatisfying cold pocket over any kind of martini & assumed some things in their vote.
The queen sweep was doomed because most of your viewers are underage and do not know what a martini is or what it tastes like
4:22 enjoy it with some WHAT!?
🐢
This my actual nightmare. This is something that always bugs me so much in life. Like I can’t eat foods if they’re not the temperatures they’re supposed to be. But props to you guys for trying 😂
I actually eat hot guac I thought it was supposed to be hot
Love the idea

Please don't like this comment
I don’t know what it is about cold food but I just cannot handle the smell! No matter what the food is I just cannot smell it cold it makes me gag!
Can you do a competition video where you have to be blindfolded and buy all these weird flavored sodas like apple pie and buffalo wing soda and guess what they are and whoever gets it right gets a point
I have always loved warm/hot  cole slaw or potato salad with crackers
They look, speak and act exactly like their dads. It is both adorable and unsettling
Shep: devours entire spoonfuls each time
Lando: is afraid of spoons 

Yep, Rhett and Link are definitely their fathers.
I would love to see Mini Mythical Morning become it's own mini series. Who's with me?
"I know what it is" said with absolute certainty, but is wrong. Shep is definitely Rhett's son.
Link: “as you can see,”
The kids: “WE CANT”
Link has never looked prouder
April fool's 2020: Shando does an entire episode of gmm and more but never addresses the fact that it is them. Show goes on completely as usual.
Lando's little shouts of surprise each and every time have stolen my heart completely
Shep is so much like Rhett, but sassier. And Lando is su much like Link, but more adorable.
mini mythical morning vs. medium mythical morning (lincoln and locke) and an episode of ltat with Lilly hosting !!
"thE MCLAUGHLINS DONT FEED YOU KRAFT?....... EVER?"
It's really great to see Lando becoming more confident. When Link said Lando didn't like being in photos. He's now appearing on GMM & LTAT on several occasions is just brilliant. Well done 👍👍👍
They are literally their dads like just wow
Lando and Shepherd just melt my heart. Little stars in the making.
Please have Lily, Locke, and Lincoln on! They're growing up too fast.
Link: "Shep, tell me what you're experiencing."
Shep: "7.5"

😂😂
If Rhett is like a Ken doll, I think maybe his vasectomy operation went awry.
Will It Ramen?
Will It Chicken Nugget?
Will It Soda?
Will It IceCube?
Will It Pillow?
Will It Pencil?
Will It Coffee?
Okay Shep and Lando are officially GMM's cutest hosts and that's not easy with their dads as competitors
Lando wanting link to be there is so sweet, link was a great facilitator 💗
Britton is literally just Link with Rhett's guitar skills and hair color.
You can see in link's eyes and face how proud he is when sitting in between them. And rhett too when they talk about the kids. It's so adorable! Y'all definitely got some competition!
Shep: takes the largest bite possible (like Rhett) 
Lando: takes the smallest nibble he could (like link)
Shep eats the whole spoon, while Lando screams and takes a little nibble.
They're just like their dads, man.
I don't wanna think about Rhett & Link retiring,  but when they do: I hope the sons take it over! 💕
Rhett: you thinking what I’m thinking 
Link: yeahhh

has two sons solely for this purpose
Lando's jumping every time a spoonful of mac and cheese touched him was the funniest thing I've seen in a while.
This was probably my favorite episode of ltat so far!! Lol, Britton's song at the end. I thought it was gonna be a legit sweet country song, then I started listening to the words. XD
THE SHANDO MINI EPISODE!!!!! My heart is screaming it was so good. They did so good!!! Very proud!!!!
You can really tell that Shep is Rhett's sweet baby boy just by the way he eats 😅🌻
This is a show where people have amazing hair, but Steve takes the crown!
They are such Rhett and Link mini-Mes!!! One takes the entire spoon in one gulp and looks happy, the other yelps and takes the tiniest little nibble! It's like watching Rhett and Link! XD
links moral support for lando is the cutest dad move of gmm
Shando Earbiscuits or Lincoln, Lily, Locke Earbiscuits Next Please.
Mini Mythical Morning NEEDS to be a regular segment!! 😸 They’re so funny!
I want to call Lando and Shep's show Good Mythical Munchkins
Lando is damn adorable!

I can definitely see "Good Mythical Morning: The Next Generation" in the future.
Shep's "i don't care" was EXACTLY like Rhett's.
THEY LOOK AND ACT EXACTLY LIKE THEIR DADS
“Just like your dad it’s already gone.” -Link Neal 2019
Lando did a good job! His little scream was so cute. 
And Shep's attitude surely comes from Rhett.
Britton Buchanan is the very best! So freaking talented, to say the least.
The way the Mclaughlin's have gigantic appetite and love for food is amazing.
Lol I hope they take over the channel when Rhett and Link retire.
Lando is such a sweet, sensitive boy. And Shep has so much spunk! I'm excited to keep watching them grow~
“Alright you tasting it shep”

“It’s just like you’re dad it’s already gone”

T_T
She stood up! She truly is the real slim shady :')
your body is a merchstand.. that should be the actual title
I didn't believe she was the real slim shady until she stood up.
I think I experienced cuteness overload with Shepard and Lando that was awesome!
Mini mythical morning is friggin adorable. They nailed it man.
Ear biscuits with Britton Buchanan should be a good idea
Link: “As you can see...”
Kids: “We cant!” 
Link: “YESSSSSSS!”
Shep and Lando for Good Mythical Summer guest hosts
My 10 year old daughter is all for Mini Mythical Mornings being a regular thing.
The singer looks like a fusion of Rhett and Link
Sheppard’s sass towards Link never fails to make me laugh
“MAH BODY IS A MERCH STAND” 😂 oh Link 😋
Shep IS Rhett. That personality has transferred right over.
I came here expecting nothing but the moment Lando presented themselves as "Good Mini Mythical Morning" I was ready to give my entire life to protect him
Shando, will it Good Mythical Morning?
YES!!
Shando is adorable, Britton is adorable, this was the best episode
Shep is just an identical clone with 100% of rhett’s dna conspiracy theory
We need more KID reviews please!!! They are adorable!!!  💕💕💕💕
Shepherd is a mini Rhett 😂😂😂 this proves that lol
So good they brought the live-action goten and trunks to host the show
that MMM segment was soo adorable <3 <3 love you guys!
Kid never had Kraft. You are too Californian Rhett
Will It Ramen?
Will It Chicken Nugget?
Will It Soda?
Will It IceCube?
Will It Pillow?
Will It Pencil?
Will It Coffee?
Is nobody going to talk about how 30 seconds in Link accidentally touches Rhett's....stuff? Like, hard too.
Omg PLEASE try and do more mini mythical mornings 💙💙 they did so well and enjoy watching them 

Just as if Rhett and link shrunk 
Its adorable!
GOSH, Lando's reaction whenever he finds the spoon is just- he's so adorable.
19:05. Shep's head turn tho, he be like, "*sniff, sniff* ITS OVER HERE."
This was so fun to watch ! I love these kids, Shep is so cool and Lando is so adorable, I would totally watch a show with them as hosts, they both did so well here and in past episodes. 
Rhett and Link are doing a great job as dads you can tell.


 💗
This is the best LTAT ever!  Shep and Lando need to do this more often and Britton was just another added bonus!!!
I was non stop laughing during the Shando clip, you should totally have more of them on the show
They are so passive-agressive towards link😕
Thumbs up for little beebee Lando overcoming his stage fright with just a little moral support from Dad! So fricken cute!
Intro: Welcome to lets talk about that, the show about the show and im Spartacus.
slim shady has very pretty hair today 😍
Now I want a mini series of Mini Mythical Morning
i laughed so hard at the frisking omg
Shep and Lando are hilariously funny together!
They are so precious! Watching them interact warmed my heart
Why does link not have a special character Rhett has damile etc
He was great on tour, I saw you guys in Nashville and he did great opening, very bright personality and very charismatic!!
I think I might be getting the miniature horse shirt for my birthday
i have the model horse that is then "macaroni pony".... wasn't expecting that
Will it Mask for October! Use liquid rubbers and see how good the resulting scary face is.💀👿👺🤡👽🎃🤖👿🧛🏿‍♂️🧟‍♂️
The R&L retirement plan is well on it's way... so smart of them to train these kids up in the family business!
love how they changed the guitars
I love these two so, so much.
"I know what it is!" he says confidently and then is wrong. Shep is 100% Rhett's son.
Link is such a good role model and dad 😊
Link with shando was the purest thing in the world
Ok so... more of mini mythical morning pleaseeee😂🙌🏽
MY HEART 😍 this is exactly what I needed to see today
shep is most DEFINITELY rhett’s son
Shando must be protected at all costs
Lando jumped every time the spoon came in with Mac n cheese. They were adorable doing Mini GMM.

I want more of Mini GMM!!
This should have been a regular episode, not a LTAT
1. Please keep LTAT a thing for the next seasons of GMM to come
2. YES THEY BE GROOMIN THE BOYS TO BE THEIR SUCCESSORS
OMG "Streep Sleep" that's something she could capitalize on.
like a ken doll; smooth would have been better
nobody:

Lando with a spoon: AAH
Damn, his cousin is amazing!
It’s so cute and baffling how they are literally carbon copies of their fathers
My sister has a crush on Shep😂
Your body is like a Merch stand
That song was amazing lol 😂😂😂
Lando and Sheppard are a lot like there dad.😂😂
LOVE THIS EPISODE!! ♡♡
Shando is the cutest ever!
"Streep Sleep is Key." Put that on a t-shirt!
I'm a simple person. I see Shando, I click the video.
link would make a great host for a kids game show
The next Rhett and link
Shep is literally Rhett reincarnated. That’s hella funny. His mannerisms and the way he even talks to link is just like Rhett. Like link says: “the scale only goes to 10.” shep: “I DONT CARE”

Okay Rhett jr
1 is an exact clone of his father in kid form 
And 1 is just super sweet
Britton's closing song was amazing! Can't stop replaying it.
I literally teared up at the cuteness
If you want to see the link rage
Watch blazetop's video on link rageing about his chair
This is literally the best episode of ltat
"Im like a Ken™ doll... Nothing"

-Rhett McLaughlin, 2019
Please more mini mythical morning
Nothing like watching your bosses frisk each other 😂
Merch stand song was sung so beautifully!
MMM needs to be a thing! Shando is so adorable
Britton has some serious skills, that fella there can sing. Britton I'd buy your CD my friend.
Lando is so precious and must be protected at all costs 😭😭
Ooh, mac and cheese, yum! ^_^
Shando are perfect. I'm sure they are proud dads 💜
Lando going "Ah!" every time the spoon came at him was adorable!
15:29 to skip to the Mac & Cheese Taste Test
Haha I loved hearing their old recordings for the title cards 😂😂😂
Best LTAT episode yet 
Keep up the good work 👍👍👍
I legit clapped ..he is great..been with gmm since toast and tongue scrapers love love love
Honestly I would love to see a full episode of Shando! It was so good!!! Do it guys!
I love mac and cheese!
OK, that's the theme song you guys need! :D
I liked the video just for the stand up Slim Shady reference.
Thanks for standing up, real Slim Shady.
If it was never told which son is Rhett's and which is Link's we could totally tell which is which. xD


And I love the subtle difference in set design, especially the use of Guitar Hero/Rock Band guitars xD
13:04 I found this surprisingly impressive
That song sounded suspiciously like Zach Williams To The Table.
oh my god i love this idea !!!!! they're both so adorable !!!
You can actually see link being so proud of the kids 😍🙌🏽
Link is SO DAMN ADORABLE with the kids!!!! He must be a great father. He definitely seems to have a paternal instinct!
Haha I loved Shando! They did such an awesome job, and having Britton perform their merch song was great as well!
Those little "OH!"s when Lando gets the spoon in his mouth- precious.
Do a vegan mac and cheese taste test!
Link is such a good dad
Ready for Shep & lando❤
What a ep👍
Cannot stop smiling at the Shando Segment!! And I absolutely loved Brittan’s heartfelt song on merch-stands👍
Shep, like Rhett = eats whole spoon of Mac and Cheese
Lando, like Link = eats a part of it 
Soooo cute!
THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS MY HEART IS SO FULL
"I'm like a Ken doll." -Rhett
i love when Rhett makes a sly joke and looks at the camera like he’s in the office lol 

“He could be packing” 23:11
This was absolutely beautiful! I enjoyed this episode lot!
This was by far the best episode of LTAT I've seen so far. I was smiling the entire time. Shando need to make more minis. Good job folks.
I try to cover up link when I watch the videos anyways lol just kidding link
Remake the unicorn rap
THE FIRST WILL IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO?!
I loved this! Lando is just too cute 😍 and I love seeing link as a father it's so adorable!!
I loved this episode so much. The Shando part was so darn cute. I cant get over those two. Especially the part: Link: "As you can see" Shando "we cant". They are copy and paste versions of their dads.
Ohmygosh they are SO CUTE
Link was so great in that MMM segment❤️ Such a great facilitator aka dad!
I see mini mythical morning and I instantly press like. Those two are too adorable, that made my day so much better!
Shep and Lando should do mini gmm more often it’s the cutest thing ❤️❤️
Please go live 😣😣
That was literally the CUTEST episode
Lando yells every time he feels the spoon even though he’s expecting it 🤣🤣🤣
meryl streep is the most overrated actress of all time
Hay buddy Holley love it so talented your amazing dude
Lando: "AH!" everytime the spoon is remotely near.
He literally swallowed the spoon full😂
Lando is just like his father, he eats partial spoonfuls. Always leaving some on the spoon till the last bite. (Reference to the low fat vs regular ice cream taste test episode)
Absolutely loved Good Mini Mythical Morning! Shep and Lando did a great job! I hope to see lots more of them! 😀💙
😍 omg link has a good looking family 🤣
omg, such a great ltat!! loved MMM, loved the musical performance. what a talented bunch!!
I SCREAMED THEY’RE SO CUTE I-
Aw the Shando episode was so cute! I love how they changed the set decorations with the little guitars 😍
I love Shando 😭 they're so sweet! And SO similar to Rhett and Link
Mini mythical morning just made my whole year. This was the cutest thing ever!
Hot dam 🔥 she's hott
"Your body is a merch stand"  might be the most poignant and stark statement of this century.
#Shando is the GOAT
We need more!!
Aldi brand macaroni is the best. Period.
Sheppard is going yo beat Link up one day
more mini mythical morning😂🥰❤️
"As you can see, -" "- we can't." "Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas!" No lie, I burst out laughing at that part.  So funny, I had to watch it twice.  Seriously, Lando and Shepherd are great together.  I wish we could see Lily, Link Jr, and Rhett's other son though.
i always forget they have legs
Sorry in Australia we dont deep fry ribs lol
Lando is such a sweet boy. Shep is Rhett’s son. 🤪
Were literally looking at the next generation of GMM host everyone!!!! Lando and Shepherd did an awesome job ❤❤❤❤
20 seconds in and I'm pretty sure that's the start of a Rhett and Link fanfic somewhere
Link is really proud of his cousin <3
They're literally one of my happy pills
I feel like Rhett and Link should be concerned that their sons already have what can only be described as a ship name
Throwback comment


Rhett and link were in eat randy
I love every LTAT but this was by far my favorite one!! Britton and link’s banter is  hilarious!
I must have more lando and shep episodes
"We rode scooters. It took an hour and a half to download the app."

WTF is this world coming to?
SHANDO IS ADORABLE. I WILL FOREVER LOVE THIS! Thank y’all!!
Aww cuteness overload ❤
I love Britton's accent, he's also really talented so... we looove ♥️
there needs to be a permanent mini GMM series
shep and lando are so freaking cute
😭😭😭 Link is such a good dad/uncle omg
Shep is such a little Rhett!!! So cute! ❤️❤️❤️
I also love Link's proud cousin smile
My God they're carbon copies of their dads
20:33 The same look Link gives Rhett. 🤣
Link: Lando, you got two right!
Lando: Is that good?
"It scaiwed me" that was adorable 😭
Girl you've used that into before
Shep and Lando are literal mini versions of their dads sooo cute =]
You guys should get “Chasing Da Vinci” on LTAT
Absolutely love Mini Morning!
Britton actually looks kind of like a Rhett/Link hybrid when I see him next to them! So funny! Love you all!
I love mini mythical morning ❤️

Love Jason Wilkes! You should have him on the show!
I like how you can definitely tell whose kid is whose xD 
Shep is so much like Rhett and Lando has weird taste like Link
MMM was the cutest thing I've ever seen and that merch song was amazing
Two things: 1. Those kids are adorable! I love Lando's innocence. He's so sweet. Shep is EXACTLY like his dad. 2. I've never watched The Voice before, but man, Link's nephew is super talented! Very impressive voice!
The fact that she stands up when she says "im the real slim shady"😂
This is probably my favorite LTAT of all time
Do we even have ribs in Australia? Like as in common menu item?
please make more mini mythical mornings








those two are adorable beyond compare
We demand more mini GMM! 😉 They're too cute!

Looking forward to hearing Britton in Jacksonville!
ltat makes my saturday 1 million times better :O
Watching this made me realise that Wayne and Garth were the ultimate YouTubers.

I love how he’s so passionate about stinky pits 😂
Josh looks dang good in that teal shirt 😻
The boys should guest appearances more😂
Every episode in May should be mythical May
Shep's smile on 21:08 is so Rhett 😂
Rhett must be so prouud that his son has a chin
As you can see
We cant! 😂
This made me cry 😢❤️
Those boys are too prescious. My son is 3 and I look forward to the awesome experiences I get to have with him as he gets older.
SHEP AND LANDO ARE SOOO CUTEEEE
"I'm like a Ken doll" (Rhett). Is that what a vasectomy is Rhett? Lol.
Britain is absolutely amazing!
I love this episode, it might be my favorite episode of LTAT!
Lando being surprised by the spoon every single time was SO FRICKIN CUTE
Adorable mini hosts

When sheps blindfold was on the wrong side, I thought it had blended in with a green screen lol

Link declares Steve as merch 29:36
This episode is so awsome i need to see more of these kids!!!

easily the best LTAT so far!
Mini Mythical Morning was so cute!!!! 😭😍😭😍😭
Shep and Lando are so cute😢💙
Blooming Onion. Will it Meryl Streep?
They are literal little Rhett’s and links 😭😭
THE REAL SLIM SHADY STOOD UP.
Shepherd is the coolest kid on the planet
The intro proves that link is the social injustice
I GET IT. She's the real Slim Shady so she STOOD UP! 🤣
This is truly amazing
What a beautiful song for merch
link looks really a lot like rachel maddow in this episode
Doesn't anybody watch to the end?? I LOVE Britton Buchanan!!! American Idol 2018 2nd place winner!!!!!
Easily my favourite LTAT so far !!!
I absolutely LOVE mini mythical morning! Shep and Lando are adorable and hilarious, and link sitting there made it so wholesome.
where did link get that shirt?!
WE NEED MORE GM(INI)MM
At the start of the video did anyone think that mini Rhett and Link will show up. 😂
How good was “The Merch Stand” though?!
The way link and britton tell stories and just their way of speaking is exactly the same
THE BEST CONTENT YOU'VE EVER HAD!!!
Shep is hilarious, he is going to do well in life.
I love that Shep had his blindfold with the soft side outside, and that Lando was scared every time the spoon came in, and I love them so much. Bring them in every time they want to, please.
Shep and Lando are SO CUTE
i need more mini mythical morning plz
Shepherd and Lando should come back and make some GMM shows so cute 😍😍😍
I LOVE SHEPRED
I’ve never been so moved by a song about merch. 🤣😅
Make MMM a monthly series!
such a melancholy song about the merch stand
I absolutely love seeing dad side of Link😁!!  Wow the kids really are younger copies of their fathers! Rhett and Link must be super proud☺.
Can we get a "Let's Talk About That, Some More", please?
They Are So Good At This! What Cute Little Beans.
Like father- Like son.
Okay, swapping the guitars for Rock Band ones is the most adorable little touch.
I love those kids lol they have such honest reactions and answers 😁
Another great LTAT!!! Keep it coming ya guyz
I can’t wait to see you guys in Denver. 3rd° 😊
Britton is so talented and gorgeous 😍😫
Do we really need to try and one-up each episodes intro?  How about just walk in and just sit on the damn couch?
The GMMM with Shep and Lando was the literal best thing I have ever seen. So many uwus were had. Also Lando shrieking when the spoon gets to his mouth is so adorable!!! These children have made my week better. Thank you.
MORE 👏🏻 MINI 👏🏻 GMM
Its time to sleep.
Your body is a mercy stand
The boys are mini versions of Rhett and link exactly
Best LTTAT to date
Britton is low key giving me Bruce Springsteen vibes
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER. AHHHHHH.
Omg there sooooooo ADORABLE
Shep. This boi loves to eat. Just like his dad.
Shepherd and Lando are such naturals!!!
Oh my goodness!  The Mini Mythical reminds me of when Locke and Lincoln were on the Mythical Show.  Great job, guys.
@ 19:28 he says "I already know it" exactly how Rhett would say it 😂
Lando screaming and Shepard eating the whole spoon. That is literally Rhett & Link's GMM (Mini Edition) indeed.
I wanna see Link, Lando, and Britton together lol there’s so much resemblance!
I need more mini rhet and link episodes
Shando have stolen my heart once again
Will It Ramen?
Will It Chicken Nugget?
Will It Soda?
Will It IceCube?
Will It Pillow?
Will It Pencil?
Will It Coffee?
shep is just mini rhett and it's my absolute favorite
Shep is a bottomless pit just like his dad, and Lando is so soft spoken. They're so stinking adorable!!!😊💞💫

🔥🎶🎼🎵🎸🕯️ So why is there no lighter emoji???? I wanted to light my lighter for the merch song!! And dude can sing!!!🎸🎶🎼🎵🔥🕯️

Link: FOSHO
16:05 Link's face of pure pride and satisfaction is ADORABLEEEEE
Wow, I didn't quite realize the nuances of Shep and Lando being exactly like their fathers.  Also awwwwww
i like to imagine rhett and link instilling all of their phrases into their kids minds  REPEAT AFTER ME, AS YOU CAN SEE WE CANT, YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, THANKS FOR LIKING COMMENTING AND SUBSCRIBING
Omg, Mini GMM was adorable!
Lando is too precious. You did a great job, dude!

Shep easily houses an entire spoonful in one bite.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I wanna see a Will It Waffle on GMM!! Pleeeeease.  I need to know but don’t wanna do it!
This episode is perfect ribs, the kids, Mac and Cheese, Links cousin, & the song! PERFECT 👌
Best LtaT ever ... ♥
Why is mini mythical my new favourite thing?
Can Josh please have his own cooking show or something.
I absolutely love Shando but I would also like to see the 3 older kids too😁
Mini GMM with Team Shando and live music from Britton, great LTAT saturday!
Lando is so precious
I...loved...that...❤
Link in the center is so strange.
Why is it Team Shando? Team Lepherd is a better name.
Can we get merch of meryl streep on a pheonix?
That was so cute.  Bring on more shando
Please make MMM a regular thing.
Rhett's ankle makes me uncomfortable
Shepherd is so like his dad and lando is also so like his dad , they are so cute!!
Even though Link was there only to support Lando I think it was nice to see Link ans the boys together 😊
i think having link in the mini episode was amazing lol
why am i in love with links cousin
This was the first LTAT I watched all the way through, keep up content like this! Maybe have a musician every time!
Lando screams every time the spoon touches his mouth😂😂
OMG That is the best merch song I have ever heard!! Wow!
20:29 LMFAO "No, 15, get it right!"  He is definitely Rhett's son.
Love the minis. Think they should do mini versions of other gmm’s. So cute
Shep is just like his dad! Crazy!
Me and Link woo'ed at the same time when Britton was singing
that whould be a cool new series - Mini GMM :) Those 2 can make their own show :P
I’ve been around at 2.5 mil
holy buckets they are mini-me's of their dads!!
We can't. 😁👏👏👏👏   loved that bit
The only difference is that links kid acc won
MMM starts at about 15:28
lando's gonna be a heartbreaker when he's older MARK MY WORDS
This was CUTENESS OVERLOAD.
bruh they're so like their dads
okay Shando is so cute it makes me cry😭💖
That's a proud daddy
I loved the GMMM (Good Mini Mythical Morning) segment!!! They did great!!!!
the Mini Gmm show with the boy was absolutely fsntastic. they did so great.
Fanfic moment. The frisk. Not that I’m so into that. Just saying.
Oh Shep and Lando are just so cute! I can't wait for more Good Mini Mythical Morning!!! <3
I cannot handle how adorable Shep & Lando are 😭😭 MORE PLEEEEASE
im like a ken doll, nothing 


-Rhett 2019
Im like a ken doll
I’m still waiting for  the day Shando takes over the show
Oh my gosh. Mini Mythical Morning is the best. Lando is adorable and Shep is a spitting image of his father. 😂 Love when Shando is on the show. I hope we get to see more Mini Mythicalness in the future!
Shando AND Britton in one episode?? Today is a good day
Link's outfit is so good in ltat omg
Omg Lando is so cute !!!
Short spaghetti with a hole through it. Nice.
Shep looks like a mini version pf Michael from Jane The Virgin.
This. Is. So. Adorable. 😭
best episode of LTAT by far
I love this so much!
Freakin' Britton Buchanan! Goosebumps man. Literally goosebumps.
This was the best idea for a video EVER!
your boys are so cute
I cried from overexposure to adorableness Shep and Lando are so cute! This should be a thing more often!
My heart not ready for this amount of adorable kiddie show hosting:


Sobs in cuteness
16:23, I can see the rhett in him lmao
you guys should do "Will it Torrtellini"
Lando is so much like Link every time the food comes in
His cousin is adorable 😂 almost an accent
I would have called it "Meryl Sleep"
I FREAKING LOVE IT
Buchanan looks like a fusion of link and rhett
I'm a simple human-- I see Shando, I click :)
I like Britton. More.
LANDO IS TOO PUREEEEEE AHHHHHH
The clones are coming along nicely
Okay, we need more of this serious. This is tooo cute!
They r so much like thier father's lol
Shep is JUST like Rhett
The boys are so cute!
AH! * nibble *
I agree. Lando needs to play the next grinch childhood part
Mac and cheese is the best thing in the world
Josh, you are an icon
Omg I could listen to Britton all day
16:20 it's funny how you know which is Rhett's kid and which is Link's just based on reaction alone. Lando screams because he's scared of the Mac'n'Cheese and Shep eats everything in one bite.
Mini GMM is the most adorable thing I have ever seen and I need MORE.
We need more Shando GMM shorts 😍
This is so cute😍😂💕
Omg more Shando pleaseee! I adored this! Lol
Lol😂 The kids are so cute💜👍🤣
This is literally the cutest thing ever. And it should happen again
I totally want more GMM Mini episodes lmao. That was so adorable XD
Make mini gmm a series pleaseeeee
Oh is it Saturday already? Wow.
YES I LOVE SHANDO
Why did you react about your chair right and you said the f word plenty of times but you think it's enough
What a great episode. Shando is so cute. What kind of monsters disliked this???
sweet flower wowww
Link is so cute in the Mini.
oooooooh, more Shando GMMs please please please
just, have link sit outside of camera view in future, nothing personal ;P
This was by far my favorite LTAT!!!
We need a regular Mini Mythical Morning. That could be the Sunday show.
love the merch stand song
I didn't know link wrote about social injustice
I love Britton’s accent
All the guitar hero guitars in the back lol
lando is literally a link shadow
Shep eating the whole giant spoonful is a mood
my fav LTAT so far
Is Steve a Game Grumps Fan? " See, what w-  ha- happend was"    xD
Kraft>Annie's>velveeta
“Get it right” Shep to Link 😂
rhett's everyday post laugh exhaling at 26:09 gives me life
Their children are clones. I am convinced.
"Where?"

"....wut"
Who else thinks Link is amazing
This made me smile so much (:
The future of Good Mythical Morning is looking bright, people!
This needs to be a regular thing! They're so cute!
Yes!! We definitely need a “will it bloomin’ onion”
Mini Mythical Morning. My heart.
This could be Link's video application to TSA, he got RIGHT up in there! lol
wow, skip to 15:26 for the mac and cheese tasting.
ok so now i need more shep and lando content, i loved it!
Love you guys, but audible is bunk
I've never been advertised too in such a beautiful sounding way lol
The guitar hero guitars are 👌😂
16:34 What I'm told everytime I eat
i love shando with my entire heart and soul theyre adorable
Please make mini mythical morning a thing!!!
They are JUST LIKE their parents! LMAO!
Makes you wonder if GMM will outlast Rhett and Link. They are the show, but GMM is a fully functioning business.
Passing the torch!
Great episode. SO glad I can always rely on this channel to pick me up when down.  Thank you for not engaging in drama online and making this a safe place. When you look around you and everything is overwhelming you can count on the GMM team to make your day mythical!!!! MUCH LOVE
Do a will it guacamole
adorable <3
This is the cutest thing ever 😭💖💖
You wanna know what a sick macaroni is?

Mac and Sneeze
I watch things sped up and I love how I had to slow down when the kids started talking lol
Rhett and Link morphed into one person = Britton lol
why is link the way he is lmao
They’re such good parents and their kids are the absolute sweetest! Super genuine n relatable and I always love watching everyone interact.
Gosh they are so cute. Lando is fricken precious
Cousin is fine
ive watched the good mini mythical morning segment literally 5 times now shando is too cute  /)w(\
LANDO 👏 IS 👏 THE 👏 CUTEST 👏 KID 👏 EVER 👏
Lando has the absolute cutest voice I’ve ever heard 😊
18:40 Kawasaki analysis
Shep just annihilating those spoon fulls of mac n' cheese just like dear ol' dad :D
Omg do a GMM mini Monday!!
Link is a woo girl
I think link was actually a perfect addition for this. he was a great moderator!
30 minutes of fantastic content.
For god's sake somebody please Meryl Streep a blooming onion already.
Mini mythical was so adorable!!!
They are crazy in sync
Do what's in my pie with weird stuff in a pie and you have to guess what it is
Happy mother's day to you guy and the crew. Have great day.
I am so for MMM. Please keep making theeem.
we need more mini mythical morning!!!!

“I’m like a Ken doll!” -Rhett

Basketball is a great sport
Mini Mythical Morning! MAKE THAT A THING!!! plz&thnks <3
Can we just get a whole season of MMM while the dads are on break this summer? 😉
Kraft is so good though
Also Link and Britton look a lot alike
Oh my goodness mini gmm im dyinnnnggg sooooo cute
Well I now I know who is going to keep GMM going after Rhett & Link 
retire. 15:35
This is one of the best things you guys have done! The banter, the fun segments, the silliness, everything! I love it so much!
"mini" mythical morning... Haha I see what you did there just took me 30mins
Rhett's got a mangina?!
LANDO IS SO CUTE I AM DYING
Freaking epic! Britton is a powerhouse performer. I would love to see him and Rhett and Link live, I bet that is amazing. The Mini Mythical Morning was perfect, we need more. We need more of everything included in this LTAT.
I wish someone would look at me the way Rhett looks at rib fries
Link that was such a great dad moment. I want to see more mini mythical mornings with either of you as co-hosts.
Link is just a big kid in the segment with Shando
I love Link so much !
Likes for Shando
Links made his kids a nervous wreck just like himself lol.
16:06 he is so proud
Those kids are so much like their dads
shep looks like rhett lol
You guys should do a will it chocolate 🍫 milk
I fangirled more than I care to admit on their minis
Wow they really are their minis 😳
Anyone else alarmed that shep and Lando look the exact same...👀👀👀
Would love to talk to Britton about Bruce Springsteen
And such a missed opportunity for Good Miniature Morning
Omg I love Mini GMM (even though they got rid of the "good" so maybe it's MMM)
Best LTAT yet!
Shep and Lando are pros and their tiny voices are the best thing ever.
This LTAT was EVERYTHING
Mini Mythical Morning was the cutest thing Ive ever seen in my life Im not able.
the rhett wobble™ should be known as mclaughlin wobble™
Lando has avenged his father with honor.
Shepard is so much like Rhett. "Well that's not part of the scale" "I don't care"
Okay. I don't even like kids but that made my heart hurt from the cuteness.
19:39 dat mini-Rhett laugh is the best x'D
Shep is literally a mini Rhett
The next generation of Mythical Morning, Shep and Lando.    :)
I love how no one knows what macaroni is called xD
Finally Britton is back
Helicopter Link
I think link made it better. With the kids being kinda awkward, link just made it that much better for them and us
Lando is the cutest ever!
Blind bread taste test next?
I think a social injustice was violated within the first minute there..... LOL!!!
This show just keeps getting better
Such a great show!!!!
I real am going to the merch store after this video
15:29 starts the mini mythical morning :) yw
Hey Rhett and Link love your videos very creative and that is why I love it 😀

The boys did a FANTASTICAL job!!! Seriously, hopefully they'll want to do more.
The Shando Show! Make it happen!
when gmm ends ones day I except shep and lando to take over with their own good mythical morning lol
I will forever know that Steve is to the left of Rhett when she announces things 😢😭
Lando is so sweet 😭😭😭😭
The amount of times they say things in unison is crazy, and most of the time it's random which makes it even funnier 😂👍
Covering links face doesn’t work when he talks like I get why he has to talk but still
That was insanely cute
THEY ARE JUST THE CUTEST KIDS EVER
AS YOU CAN SEE....
The audible sponsor was half the episode
Shep and Lando... oh my freaking heart! LOVE them!
Rejected snack actually delicious.
Shando doing a mini GMM episode.
Britton doing a musical number.

Truly, we have been blessed.
I want more MMM. I need it.

it's actually a much better thing that Link was there - he provides someone for them to talk to and facilitate things.
Hi gmm! It's actually not morning for me it's my bedtime I should be in bed😂
We love you Britton!!!
WE NEED MORE OF MINI MYTHICAL MORNING!
Britton and link have the same exact hair cut
I was once on a flight with the danish Meryl Streep
When Britton started singing I got chills 😍😍😍

OMG I'm dying. This is the cutest thing I have ever seen!!! Shep & Lando need their own channel!!!
I LOVE SHANDO. You can just cancel GMM, we don’t need Rhett and Link anymore.
I like how both of them didn't talk with their mouths full lol
rhetts foot at 15:21
MINI RHETT AND LINK literally 😂😂❤️ so cute Lando melts my heart everytime
I AM EFFING DYING OMG MINI LINK AND RHET OMG OMG OMG
I would love to be with Rhett's family. They're not afraid of food. I love food!
15:27, you’re welcome
The boys are the most adorable things EVER!!!!
Britton's singing took me by surprise. His accent just disappeared
6/10 is the highest rating Velveeta mac and cheese deserves, and nothing more.
I need more mini gmm. They're too adorable. Their mannerisms are so much like their fathers it's hilarious.
#shando is the best!
We need a Shep and Lando Show right fricking now guys. #MACNCHEESEREVIEW

Lando is so precious ♥️♥️♥️
"I'm the real Slim Shady" proceeds to stand up.

We need more Shando, the show is amazing as is but Lando And Shepherd make it even better.
Please give us more Shando!!
Omg mini gmm is too adorable!!!!
Is it even a ltat episode without link saying/doing something inappropriate unknowingly
ive never had kraft
we need more.
I'm listening to this while shading my digital painting at 5 AM. What a fun show.
why is every episode becoming about Rhett's genitals lol
0:34 When you’re up at 3 AM and get the notification that a GMM video is up...
Britton is seriously SO talented
Omg shep 😂
Imagine when rhett and link retire and their kids takeover. The legacy lives on as the descendants take over the show.
Lolll when Shepp almost ate the spoon along with the mac and cheese, thats when I knew Rhett and Shepp are the same person
link "your body is a merch stand."  2019
why is lando so ADORABLE
Britton is just Dark Link.
15:30 your welcome
Link’s family is talented af wtf
Up here in Canada we call boxed Mac and Cheese Kraft dinner exclusively..... Kraft or nothing
"I don't care!!" He's such a Rhett.
#Shando show takeover!
Best LTAT so far!
can we have more episodes hosted by the kids?
I like how you put some guitar hero guitars instead of real guitars!
lando is so so so cute omg
I can't wait for when Rhett and Link retire and we get Shep and Lando
cute and adorable. mini gmm should be a thing
Remember NeverWet? this was like 3 years ago but I found two bottles of it $1 at the dollar store I laughed so hard it was so hilarious because they used to be $10
These were the shortest 30 minutes!!!
Mini Mythical Morning is the cutest thing ever!!!!!!!
oh my god. i didn't know how much a little rhett and link would effect me. this is too cute i cannot handle it!!!!!!!!!
MORE MINI GMM!!!! 😍😍😍
MORE MMM PLEASE
SHANDO IS SO DARN CUTE
Josh, we don’t deep fry ribs. We actually hardly eat them 🤣!
Also can you have Britton make sick folk songs for all the game jingles from now on ???
lol the merch song XD
We named our fish Shando and Shasta.  Best names ever!
I wanted to buy merch after Britton sang
Oh my god Shep and Lando are like genetic clones of their dads XDDDDD
GMM Mini is amazing
Flipping adorable
One day Shep and Lando will be the hosts of this show.
Annie’s home grown for sure is my favorite. But a nice box of kraft Mac & cheese I’m down
Great show this weekend. Was very cool seeing Britton on here
Oh my god Shep and Lando are the cutest ever.
Britton is just the coolest and chillest guy
What's so cute about this is that they really do have their dads' same energy. Like everything the kids said is 100% what their dads would say 😂
I thought this was gonna be its own series🥺
Rhett gets way more attention then link
Lando's little "Ah!" Whenever the spoon came in was adorable and so Link-ish!
My bf said her highlight makes her look like a football player
I honestly forgot what i was watching until half way until the video cough cough video starts at > 15:27 cough cough
#shando are too cute and awesome. More mini gmm
Can we please have more Mini Mythical Morning?! It is so adorable and their boys are amazing!
I am totally ok with mini mythical morning! loved it!
Shep and Lando ARE their dads!
You got 2 points! 
Is that good?!
Best LTAT I’ve ever seen. For so many reasons. #Shando #MerchStand
This is so cute... they are EXACTLY like their dads I LOVE it :)
19:10 “ahhh”
Why are Link and Shepherd’s interactions so similar to him and Rhett’s? I love it
21:34 listen to Lando omg he’s such a lil cutie
Let's post enough to convince them that Mini Mythical Morning should be a regular thing. Shando is too cute!
Shep is just Rhett shrunk down
Shepard : "IT'S 15! GET IT RIGHT, NEAL!"
I need more Mini Mythical Morning. It is pure awesome.
I love how every time the spoon hits lando’s mouth he just screams
They look so much like their dads, Holy cow.
why wasn't it called good miniature morning
I thought that there aint gonna be a LTAT episode this week cause of the title.
I love LTAT! 😁❤️
Theyre so cute 😍
Remember when they were in epic rap battles of history
Lando is so adorable I'm  crying
For once I’m early 🙃 but sadly it’s 5am😩
This was the cutest thing!
sHEP AND LANDO ARE SO CUUUUUTTEEE
Give #Shando a few years and they can have their own show, and I will definitely watch!
28:06 Rhett and Link look like a proud mom and dad 😂
Wait a minute
This was the best GMM/LTAT episode ever! I just loved it! 💗💕
More performances please
#ShepDon'tCare
Love the unison part, loved how you showed how you are really good at it now
God i would love if the Kids became the hosts in the future 😊
I loved the GMMini segment.
This was so god damn adorable i couldn't even watch it
Lando is such a sweet little guy. I love him 😭 Every time he’s on I wish I had kids.
It's like when you sing your favorite song but don't know the words!
Personally I prefer velveeta
THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. Shep and Lando need a while day of the week to themselves where we just get mini mythical morning!! Amirite?!
Lando is so adorable!
Britton looks like a mix of Rhett and Link, the glasses and the hair!
The two boys are so cuteeee
Can you guys do a GMM episode with Collins Key?
In 10 or so years it better be these kids controlling the channel!
so adorable! I am a bit sad Stouffers wasn't an option ._. i get it though.
We need more mini gmm! This is what the world needs 😂
Link looks just like the guy on Wayne's World get him a blond wig lol
Lando and Shep are adorable as hosts!
Omg everytime Lando screams a lil when the mac comes makes me laugh omg. Hilarious. Also its really really sweet that Link was there, I actually think it was a nice touch to have him there. Nice episode of LTAT guys, made me smile.
Sooooo cuuuuute. Lando’s innocent flightiness is soooo stinkin precious! Sweet babes. Yep...I’m a mom. Haha
We need more Mini Mythical Morning!!
No one:
Link: fosho
Are we not gonna talk about the song
Will it dog food?
Omg cutest ever!
I have those macaroni ponies
What a good LTAT. I’m now 10 times more hyped for the show in Tampa. September can’t get here soon enough
consistent entertainment you can count on to be drama free LOVE GMM
Might be one of the best episodes of gmm content. Love the kids guessing the mac and cheese that was so fun
Truly adorable children!
Wholesome episode. Good stuff.
What's up noti-fosho-cation squad?
Shepherd is such a mini Rhett it’s uncanny, looks wise but even more so mannerism and personality wise. Very trippy.
Please make mini mythical morning an actual thing!!
WTHHHHH OH GOD WHY DO SHEP AND LANDO LOOK LIKE TWINS 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 IM SHOOKT WOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY LITERALLY LOOK LIKE TWINS SO COOL
Link is for the children!
I’ve never had blind mac ‘n cheese before.
Brit's becoming old news.
All I could do the whole time was scream about how cute they were 😭
Rhett should do the next one
Omgosh they are soo cute! I think this needs to be a new series.
Britton and Link look sooooorta related. Kinda. A little bit.


OMG "Mini Mythical Morning" is an actual dream come true!
wow britton is really good!! even with a silly song like that lol. also i kinda teared up just to see the support from these dads he has. that's wonderful and so sweet
Shep and Lando are gonna be the next Rhett and Link
GOOD MINI-CAL MORNING
SHANDO is Rhett and Link 2.0, meaning... better!  give them their own show! So cute!
I would def watch a shando series like this. There needs to be more!
meryl x gmm merch.... just saying
link and his son both accidentally make inappropriate jokes
Anyone else only here for Britton? 😍😭💕
Shando are so cute omg.. and it's pretty crazy how similar they are to their dads, like idk if I've ever seen two children so similar to their parents before lol
7:49 Do Americans think we actually eat that?
I'm concerned about Rhett's ankle... 22:24
That GMM with Shando hit me right in the heart!! So cute!!!!
16:04 is when it really happens...
They’re so adorable!!!!! 💖💖💖
Mac & Cheese starts at 15:30
Rhett Likes to Eat, episode 8.
I don't even like kids but Lando is the cutest ever
Love the Mini GMM!
1) I've never had Kraft either and I'm an adult. My parents lived the off-brand organic life and I liked it about as much as you could get a kid would like a situation like that.
2) That was probably the most adorable episode of anything on the internet.
So much sodium
❤ #goodminimythicalmorning
Mini Mythical Morning is EVERYTHING!
This is too cute
I adore Mac and cheese
15:28, ain't nobody got time for that.
Mini mythical more
I love when Shando guest stars haha. I love how Rhett and Link treat each other’s children like their own. So beautiful how their friendship has turned them into a family!❤️
Shando is so cute!!
Maybe you should do a vlog when traveling
I want the recipe for deep fried ribs really really bad
Landos little screams are the cutest lmao
Give Britton a Grammy RIGHT NOW for that song! Brilliant. Also #shando is the cutest thing ever.
I want a macaroni pony!
No-ones addressed this yet so - THIS IS NOT AN AUSSIE INVENTION, clearly American... lol.  Ps Josh - it’s pronounced Ozzie
Omg they’re so innocent and pure
I want some mac n cheese
Lando is the sweetest kid!!!
Mini mythical is so freaking cute! The kiddos are super funny 😆

"will it blend? That is the question" is from an old show that was awesome. I think thats why link was saying "that is the question"
D'awwwwww
Awesome job on GMMM, everyone involved! Treating Link like a "guest" was perfect and super effective. The boys were hilarious and really on point! And pony spoons... come on. Thanks so much this was so great.
That was so damn cute 😁
Heard you guys are passing by James Charles in a few hours. Safe travels!!!🙏❤️❤️❤️
Can Mini Mythical Morning be an actual thing please?
I've got to say lando was kinda like me. Now I'm up on stage, singing, doing the hula, and playing ukulele
More mini...
Shep and lando is gonna inherit this show
14:40 Cmon people, you're supposed to be Pros. You could've just dressed Link in a green suit and digitally removed him after...plus we get to see bonus footage of Link walking around dressed in a bright green suit too.
I made a Mac and cheese taste test a week ago! Great minds think alike
Lando and Sheperd were so cute ! They are so funny ! It was so thought for Link to not lead too much the segment 😂
Will it DRito
Shando is sooo cute!
I'm sad they won't be continuing LTAT next season
The relationship between the kids and with link is adorable
Not enough love for Britton in the comments! He’s lovely!
They’re so cuteee
Make mini gmm regular ! Ofcourse if Lando wants to..
Early squad
I love your shows still can't believe outback over Texas roadhouse. Outback is not good.
im like a Ken doll... nothing
22:21 Rhett’s ankle
19:03 😂😂 bring in the horses, ahhhh owww, where is it
Omg omg!Finally I woke up at 3 am to watch you guys!!!
skip to 15:30
cute!!!
I love this so much! Good mini mythical morning
Shando and Britton in the same episode. This was such a great episode!!
GMMini is officially my favorite segment and there absolutely needs to be many more
More MMM!!!!
The kids are perfect minis and so cute 💖💖💖
OMG they are so much like their dads! So cute!
i'm really sad that they aren't going to be continuing ltat next season
OMG the mini mythical morning was amazing lando and shep are just the best just like their fathers
Omg they are so adorable!!!!!!!!!!
I HAD to watch this again, your boys are so cute! :)
Lando did so good announcing the instructions hes come so far!!
That intro with Link groping Rhett should have been called Good Mythical Molestation.
mini mythical morning is the best thing that’s ever happened
I just wanna request if you ever do another hotdog or weird food combo episode you represent new Hampshire with the mountain man dog-Mac and cheese, relish, onion and pepper relish.
Mini GMM is everything I’ve ever needed
Didn’t know they were cousins!!!
Outback doesn't not equal Australian food
Omg they are so cute!!
They so resemble their fathers in so many ways.
Omg that mini mythical morning is adorable!
Honestly every time Shepherd and Lando come on I get so happy, they're such good kids, Shepherd has such a good sense of humour and Lando is possibly the cutest kid I've ever seen, he just seems so sweet, I can't.
3rd
This. Is. The. Cutest. Thing. Ever. OhmygOd im gonna cry like there are tears threatening to spill yall.
lando is so cute
im gonna miss this during the summer. LTAT is bu far my favorite new addition to the GMM lineup in yearssss
These to need to become the new rhett and link when the others have retired
why does link look like a 46 year old lesbian mother in this
the kids are literally just mini versions of rhett and link, it's insane
Mac and cheese
16:03
I want to see more with the kids in it!! They are so cute!
Link being in dad mode makes him so much more attractive omg it warms my heart
27:30 BEGINS SINGING THE BALLAD OF CHASEY LAIN that's what I would do at least
Aww~ this was cute!
When Rhett and Link retire Shando shall rule over this land.
I love Good Mythical Mini! They're so cute! I want more in the future!
No
Ahah they are sooo much like their dads it’s amazing! 😃
They're just Rhett and link's mini me
I can confirm that we, in Australia, DO NOT deep fry ribs. Literally anything at Outback Steakhouse is not even remotely Australian. Just a PSA for you all ☺️👍
Shep is a little clone of Rhett
I LOVE IT
Why is Lando the cutest kid ever!!!
Rhett and Link are probably just training Shando to carry on GMM when they retire. IM READY FOR GMM WITH SHEP AND LANDO
Mini Mythical Morning. The Triple M.
the body language is awesome to watch
God, Shep even laughs like his dad.
I’m in love with Britton
I'm in my 30's and still love me some Kraft Mac & Cheese. Totally forgot Annie's was a thing, I was probably in middle school the last time I had it.
LANDO IS SO CUTE!
those kids are absolutely adorable
This is cuteeeeee
Lando also can not find the food just like his dad lol
You'd be surprised how many people order those rib blooms and twisted ribs
he is such a mini rhett
We need more MGMM! That was so adorable and funny!
1) I never heard of outback steak house until I moved to America. 
2) mini mythical morning is so cute. Monthly series at least
My family has the same "halfway between" chain restaurant get together, but ours is Olive Garden instead of Outback.
Can I know when was the time when this episode was released?
lovely song at the end..!
Did she say Brett and Link?
shando is the best thing ever, i need more mini mythical morning
This was my favorite episode. The kiddos are so dang cute.
Sorry, Rhett and Link, I think Lando and Shepard might be my new favorite hosts.  But you guys are close behind! 😜
"oh..okay.."
#MAKEMMM
0:05 LOL Amazing intro! Didn't see any comments about it, am I too old?
its actually insane how they are exact replicas of their fathers just dumbed down.
Mini Mythical Morning is some wholesome stuff...
Why does link have a bruise middle finger and a bruise on his cheek bone?
Landon takes like a single piece of macaroni at a time. Then you look over to Shep and he’s eating a whole spoon full at a time
Those kids are adorable, there’s no question on who’s the daddy lol they look just like each of them
There was 999 comments so I just had to be the 1000th
SHANDO!!
Me 10 minutes into the video: OH..... she stood up...... because she is the real slim shady.....
More shandoooo
Man I wish they’d come to Austin
Mayonnaise and ranch,  on ribs....SMH
Everyone always talks about how adorable Lando is (and he is) but I’m fairly positive Shep is the coolest kid alive. He’s gonna rule the world.
The next generation hosts of GMM, and it’s funny how similar they are to their Dads😂
Lando is so stinkin' cute!
15:30
These episodes get better and better!
More shando!
I heard Britton sing that in Cleveland;)
Who's here for just the mini gmm?
I would rather listen to Heads will Roll the song
Lando is the cutest human in existence
I loved the mini good mythical. Even with link in there. Link added to the video without taking the shine from the boys
is that Biff's brother ?
Your wifes are photocopiers?
Heads will Roll is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard! It has my full endorsement! There was even a part where they made fun of ASMR, which GMM has been known to do. If they make a sequel, I think it should feature the voices of Rhett and Link!
It's pretty cute how much like their dad's they see
15:27 so yall can just watch the kids
Thought it was blind Mac and Chase taste test. 😢
I wonder if they realise they now have to do a Will It Blommin' Onion?
Mini Mythical Morning will usurp Good Mythical Morning in one fell swoop
Brilliant
LINK TOUCHED RHETTS ENTIRE-
I love Mini Mythical Morning! Please keep doing it if the kids are into it. The boys are so cute and entertaining.
I wanna meet the older members of the Neal-McLaughlin family ( mostly because I’ve seen pictures of Rhett’s son and I need to see him)
Like father like son... Shep dislocated his jaw to take the whole huge spoonful, while Lando took a little smidgen!
Way to go Shando!
that is a great show a mini mythical morning weekly show
Shep and Lando have to take over GMM one day
WE NEED MORE MINI MYTHICAL MORNINGS!
shando is tooo cute
More Mini Mythical Morning!!
Literal mini GMM they are freaking identical to their dads
Shando is the best thing since sliced bread, they’re gonna grow up besties like their dads
I like to eat macaroni&cheese
Link's Dad has the strongest genetics on Earth. 3 generations of little clones!
they are so stinking cute!!
Lando is so precious he is all of our sons. Shepard is the kid who kicks the back of the seat in an airplane but we love him anyways.
Is there any way you guys could get Tom Ellis on the show? I think he would be a good fit with GMM.
They should make more Time Rangers episodes, but now they can meet these younger versions of themselves in the past and mess with causality.
that little shot of lando at 21:10 😭 he has GORGEOUS eyes. such cute kids :’), they’re so much like their dads lmao
15:55 links “hmmm”
I love how Shep eats the whole thing of Mac and cheese just like Rhett and Lando eats a little bit just like Link😂
I love mini mythical morning please more
Loved mini mythical morning! So cute!
Link or Rhett should be in between until Shando get comfortable. And Link's sense of humor added some additional spice, not that Shando alone isn't great to begin with.
15:50 this makes my heart HAPPY 😂😂🥰😍 I cantttt
I missed the part that the song was meant for Rhett and Link purposes and so I got reeeaalll confused
I vote for Mini Mythical Morning, as a part of LTAT every Saturday, it's amazing how in sync Shepherd and Lando were with each other during the whole segment, they're basically mini versions of their fathers.
I met Link once at a beach and Lando was just a baby, It's so weird seeing him now
These noodlie thingies...
The torch is beginning to be passed on
Lando and shepp are my favorite people on this planet ❤
Mini rhett and link. Shep def need to be a stand-in for rhett when rhett can’t make it. 😂
I want an episode with only them at least once a week
Awwwwwww that was the cutest!
Good Mythical Morning now bigger than James Charlesl lol
I love Mini Mythical Morning! Shando is so cute!
omg mini mythical morning will be a thing haha i know it
Oh my gosh, Lando and Shep are sooo cute! They are literally mini versions of their dads. I think I see the future hosts of GMM... :)
16:39 god link what happened to your nail 😂😂 always something lol
Can't wait for Josh's show this summer!
"It's just like your dad, already gone" Link your'e a savage
The Shando segment was so cute!! Link was great guiding them!
Link is such a good dad. 
I think my ovaries just exploded.
I love shep so much he is soooooo funny
I think we should have a Mini GMM with Rhett going on camera and Link going on the next episode and so on.
MORE MINI MYTHICAL MORNINGS ugh we stan shando
Mini mythical morning whoever had this idea needs a raise
15:18 Rhett's leg is very odd looking
Awww Lando is the cutest kid i have seen :)
where's mini mythical more?
it’s insane how they say the stuff in sync like that... mind b l o w n
Cutest GMM episode ever!
If you want to start a new channel for your kids name it Good Mythical Morning Jr. 😎👌🏻
2:25 haha that finger snap was awesomely awkward
Oh man they are so stinking cute!!! Lando is sooo adorable.
they’re so cute bro i literally can’t
am I the only one saying FOSHO with Link at the end? 😂😂
Is the speaker girl like comfortable? Idk how to explain but whenever I decide to watch one of these vids. She just seems... idk. Somewhat uncomfortable with Rhett n link all buddy buddy together.
LANDO IS SOOOOOOO CUTEEEEEE
SLIM SHADY!???? LMAOOOOOO SHE'S SO CUTE
Sheppard and Lando should host the next April Fools episode
Lando is so cute omfg
Kiddos you did such a good job!! Had a good laugh and learned a lot about Mac and Cheese!
Ok but please have Shando on more often because they're adorable
Mini GMM!!!! Whaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?!?!? 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Mythical beast approved!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I'm officially waiting for brendon urie to come on the show.
no mustache!!!
WHAT THE HECK SOOOOOOOOOO CUTE
i miss link´s beard
30 minutes aint no mini MM baby.
Give the people what they want! More MMM! So adorable.
The fact that Americans don't call it Kraft Dinner will never-not blow my mind.
Link looks so shoehorned in for the GMMini
Lando’s reaction every time the spoon was in front of him 😂😂
Another great episode you guys are truly amazing.  Mini mythical morning was amazing, And that song was inspired gonna buy some merch
Please have the kids do more together that was adorable!
start here: 15:30
PLEASE DO MORE MINI MYTHICAL MORNINGS!! THEY ARE LITERALLY LIKE TINY VERSIONS OF THEIR DADS! IT'S THE GREATEST THING EVER!
29:49 Link = 😜
OH MY GOODNESS those boys are so sweet!!! MORE MINI-GMM Please!!! <3
THEY'RE SO FREAKING CUTE MY HEART IS ESPLODING
There is no way you guys can surpass Shep and Lando cuteness, Lando is so adorable! And their episodes are always my fav.
it's pretty spectacular how similar shando and their dads are! also, shando must be protected!!
Such a great LTAT. Thanks💕😂😂😂
Hey I need this song on Spotify lol
The boys are so cute, Shep like INHALED that macaroni
Shando and Britton?!?     Best LTAT ever!
Shepard looks so much like Rhett.
I adore Shando! I'll even scrub through LTAT to get to them. I normally can't stand LTAT. But I see Shando, I click!
Loved the #shando #mgg episode. If they did another one that'd be so awesome.
Lol they replaced all the guitars with guitar hero, and rock band guitars
Lando: :° 
Shep: :O
Please keep Mini Mythical Morning alive!
Lmfao the boys are JUST! like their dads. Lando is literally the cutest 😭😭😂😂
Best episode of ltat ever! Shando was the cutest. They really do act just like their dads especially Shepherd. And Lando is just too cute for this world.
Shep and Lando are too cute. I hope they are with Rhett and Linc when we see them live next month.
Omg, mini mythical morning!!! Make this a regular thing!!!
Link just wants to touch peoples junk
starts at 15:34
OMG! THEYRE SO CUTE!!
I laughed so much with this!
When they started frisking each other 😭
Shep is just like Rhett!
Lando is so cute. ♡♡♡
MORE SHANDO!!
The MMM (Mini Mythical Morning) was great 👍🏼. Having Link there reacting and moderating actually made it better (though having only Shando would probably have a differently great vibe). What would make it better is if they each wore their dad's blindfolds.
shep and lando are both so cute omg sksks
Link interrupts a lot
that's a pretty girl   😮
This was so cute
Link being there for his son is so sweet love it.
15:35
15:35
15:35
The kids are amazing, we need more of that in our lives.
Love the matching outfits today guys
People keep talking about Shando but it’s crazy how much Britton looks like Link, down to the hair, glasses and how he sits with his hands on his knees.
oh my god they’re so cute i can’t
please stand up
It’s amazing how alike these 2 boys are compared to their fathers.  Cute!
So when is Meryl Streep coming in for that ‘Will it?’ Episode?
first time watching this series and 30 seconds in I'm already saying wtf did I get myself into
The minis have PERFECT VOs
I just absolutely adored seeing their sons having a mini gmm, just so cute ❤️
Britton has an amazing voice!
OH MY GOD THEY ARE SO CUUUTE!
i love how thick britton's accent still is. spend some more time in LA and he'll sound like his cousin
This was my favourite LTAT! Loved all the segments and MMM!!! Bring it back!
Link: it was your closer 

Me:  Bruh are you really about to have him sing the merch stand song😂😂😂
Shando is life!!
MMM was the best thing I have ever watched.
Wow this was the juciest LTAT episode yet! So full of cool stuff!
I didn't need to see Rhett and Link frisk each other, but now I have and am thouroughly confused.
When he says “palatial experience” I swear I heard him say “fellatio” 😂I’m like, “wtf link, that’s your son!”
Mini gmm is the cutest!!!
will it mac n cheese?
Why would you put so much cheese on macaroni???
Omg so cute!!
I love how the kids are getting more comfortable being on the show. They used to be a lot more shy but now they are starting to open up and show their awesome personalities. Can't wait to see more fro. Them
Link you went to deep with that check
That’s a big kid in the middle.
There is an obvious song here. “Your body is a murch stand” . A riff on John Mayer’s Your body is a wonderland. But does Britain want to write more songs about murch?
Josh it’s Aussie like “OZ-EE” not “OSS-EE” 🤦‍♂️
I've only ever eaten Best Choice or Always Save.
This may have been the best intro ever. With the combination of her being the real slim shady and Link likely being a social injustice is the reason i'm with GMM till the end.
We need more mini episodes!! I loved it sooo much!!!!
honestly, I really didn't mind Link being in the middle there.  I think it was better with him.
This is so cute
Lando reminds me so much of myself as a child it’s so precious.

Shando will always be 10/10 they act exactly like their dads it’s crazy
Why didn’t y’all include Cracker Barrel mac n cheese?
Literally skipped to the mini gmm. 
They are so cute
Can the Shando show be a regular thing pleeease???
Britton and Linc have the same hair and glasses. It’s really cute. Now I want to dress as my cousins.
i’m happy that they post everyday!!!

love from a small youtuber
Ooo another taste test.
They did awesome
hmm...like father like son. :)
HAHAHAHAHAH RHETTS FACE 28:09
Mini mythical morning was me just squealing for seven minutes from all the cuteness
Put the kids on the channel more. They’re so cute
The next “Will it?” episode needs to have “That’s the question” in it now...
They soo cutee
Best LTAT episode so far!!
loved the 30 min  run time!
Lando's voice is just ao stinking adorable and Shepard is so independent. He makes BOSS moves. No encroaching on his perspective! Awesome
So frickin cute !! They are literally just little versions of Link and Rhett lol tall n bold and sweet and timid lol
When link was talking about how TSA gets "all the way up in there", I think he inherited the spirit of Chris Farley for a second
15:42 link, did you just bark?
i love rhett and links matching outfits. that color coordination. my boyfriend and i could never.
I thought they were joking when they said they were cousins, that's so awesome! And that song was great too :D
Shando was so cute
My heart. That was such a precious segment.
This is too cute!
I love Rhett's inability to stop eating food placed in front of him. A man after my own heart.
Lando copying Shep is kind of a Link move.
Omg we need more MINI MYTHICAL MORNING, AND WE NEED IT NOW..............please and thank you 🙃🙃🙃😋😋
Please stand up - Slim Shady
Dude I can totally see them taking over this show in the distant future...
YES
Love the merch song! I preorderd the book like a week ago. Do I still get something free???
Who agrees they should put let’s talk about that into good mythical more cause I like good mythical morning just being their regular stuff
They are definitely your children.
Best 1 for sure.... I Dave ghrohl love it!!!!
Will the boys take over if Rhett and Link retire?
I don’t know what’s cuter the boys being host or link watching with a face of obvious pride
So cuuuuuuuuuuteeeee
They are both adorable and are JUST like their fathers. WTG Shep and Lando on hosting this episode. Hope we get more Mini Mythical Morning episodes in the future!
I was shocked at Shep really said they don’t eat Kraft in their house. I would’ve thought Rhett would be all about it. Everything I thought I knew about Rhett is a lie.
Is anyone else getting the heebie jeebies looking at the bottom of Links shoe? No? Just me? Okay. 😔
If I was in landos grade, I would have a crush on him
I got the horses in the baccc
Love the mini GMM!! This is a great addition to the show. Both are very alike to their dads. So cute and adorable. Don’t mind seeing this from time to time!
Where is it? AHHHHHHH
I have the same shirt as Shepard lmao I need to stop shopping in the boys section of tillys
mini GMM
Damn
Rhetts ankle at 22:01
You know, GMM is the best show to watch when you are eating.
Those kids are definitely their kids
love Mini Mythical Morning!
Apple don't fall far from tree right?
I have one question about Rhett. There’s a video of Rhett raging about his chair and him swearing. Was this real.
Those boys are definitely thier fathers son's.
Ahah love the tiny guitars on the walls
I love mini mythical morning, shando is so awesome.
Lando is literally the most adorable little kid ever
Stevie is getting more and beautiful by the day
One of the best LTATs till now. Music, Mini GMM, unheard recordings and THIRTY MINUTES! I am spoilt!
Lando's voice is SO CUTE
Wow, that was a lot! Shando are the cutest, and Britton... boy he's talented.
Amazing episode of LTAT! 👏🏻
Please put in the title that's it's "let's talk about that" 🙄 I thought it was a whole regular episode. Also you're kids are adorable 😂
oh my gosh! the minis are replicas of their daddies! hope to see more of them soon
Shep and Lando are so adorable. They did awesome
Rhett: I’m like a ken doll 😂😂
BRITTON MARRY ME
A little close to the junk 😉 there. Lol
I call it streeping
Shep is like a mini Rhett
Hearing Lando's voice makes me wonder if that probably was also Link's voice back then sounded like
Can Mini Mythical Morning be a semi-regular segment on LTAT? That was so cute!
Lando screaming every single time his mouth touched the spoon is such a mood
Britton's voice is mesmerising 😍😍😍
I can't stop looking at Rhett's ankle
I require 100% more Mini Mythical Morning because I loved that and it was adorable c:
So for two seconds I though Josh had grown his mustache back....
Hit the like button for these kids.  😎 Need more. Hehe. Was fun.
Omg I can't even with Lando! Cuteness overload!
LTATurday is the best day
I want shando to have a mini mythical morning every week. Absolutely loved that
This was the absolute best LTAT!! And that song was “litty”!!♥️

Now we need the Jade & Barbara show.
This is now my favourite LTAT of all time
Stevie ❤
This is the best gmm
The Mini GMM was the BEST! The boys are so cute. They did a great job.
Omg..please please more shando gmm..that was awesome!
Should do a full good mythical morning with the boys would be pretty funny!
I need this mini mythical morning to be thing pls
sponsorship stuff ends at 2:50
omg the kids need to do more mini shows!  they are so cute!
Man, I love Velveeta so much more! But the others with the dehydrated cheese can be ALMOST as good if prepared right! (as far as boxed mac and cheese is concerned) lol
We love Shando here
Like fathers like sons
hi 742
Mmm needs to be a thing
We need a Mini Mythical Morning episode once a month now...
They're such cute cinnamon rolls :3
Mini Mythical Morning starts at 15:28
$400 is smelling like a chunk of change worth waiting for the next flight
I love Britton's singing. <3
OMG the mini mythical boys totally made my day. Please bring them back. that was fantastic.
I actually want to see Wil it Blooming Onion.
I  preordered the novel and didn't get anything
I love them 😍💓
THEIR CHILDREN ARE SO ADORABLE.
MY HEART IS EXPLODING WITH HAPPINESS AT MINI MYTHICAL MORNING!!!!!!!!!!!!  I CANNOT OVERSTATE THIS ENOUGH
I love LTAT... I hope it comes back after the summer! :)
Weird cause lando is Rhett’s character shepherd is link lol but yet they still act like their dad’s.
Bring the bacon hotline back
Like fathers like sons
Good Mini Mythicals with Shep and Lando. :)
Did Rhett dislocate his ankle?
GMMini IS GREAT
You guys should make Mini Mythical Morning as a Sunday show
Can yall do song biscuits?
The kids were great. I totally clapped irl.
Love how shep takes the whole spoonful but lando takes little bites, just like their dads 😍😭
You’re awesome and I love you and I support y’all for everything
Best idea in the world
"Hold on, where's your ear."
Omg the boys are so precious! Love when they come on.
you should have brendon urie on gmm
13:22 omg goosebumps , they're such pros now😁
SHEP US LIT!
I'm like a ken doll- nothing
Are Shep and Lando compensated with mac 'n' cheese for their appearances?
noodle pipes
Her body is a merch stand.....
Thw boys are so cute awnn
Thought Josh was a vegetarian
yay!!
Omg the kids are clones of their dad
Lol my aunt's been deep frying ribs for years... Figured here in the south it would be pretty common
Velveeta tops all
Shando make me want to go have some babies and I thought I didn’t like kids 😭😭😂
I wonder if these guys would take over for Rhett and Link if they retired :D
Oh my god how damn cuteee aww
Is it just me or is Stevie extra extra pretty this episode?! Oh and gotta love the Merch table!
I CAN'T WITH THE MINI GMM EPISODE WITH THE BOYS AAAA UTS TOO CUTE
Stevie talking briefly about Kate McKinnon is gay culture
Oh my God. A mini rhett!!!!
More Mini Morning please. I just love it
Absolutely loved the Shando segment! And the song lol that was great!
Love you Britton
“I love Mac n cheese!” Lando is so adorable😭
That song though oh my god
Shepherd eating the first spoonful of Mac and Lando eating a small portion... definitely their fathers child.
These mini mythical episodes are great
Today's episode is really great! Stan Britton for life. He looks cute with that glasses!
We need to see Shando as Good Mythical Summer guest host

Please Josh make me French toast in bed.
GMMini was awesome, another?
i need a mini mythical morning daily please and thanks
You should do a will it blooming onion. Stake will it blooming onion?  Pigs heart will it blooming  onion
Omg those kiddos are so flipping cute! Lando has the sweetest little voice! My son is three and it’s so funny watching his personality grow as he learns how to make jokes and be more strategic but his voice is still so tiny and squeaky 😂 boys are the best lol
You guys should redo more old games, especially snack blackjack
B--E-A-N-S...BEANS!
"Is that your Answer?"
"Well Yeah!"
Rhett totally missed a "my nickname in highschool" joke with the Sheila Beef.
Rhett: Sheila Beef
My brain: Shia LeBeouf???
When it said "feet", I was like

How are you going to pour feet
FINALLY! It's been 2 years since the first and only Smelling Bee
Sardine: (Tiny fish)
Tuna: (Giant fish)
Rhett: It's like a sardine
Link: TUNA
Link: did you pee in this? 
Rhett: o___O
The bee was refreshingly jolly for one having its freedom violently taken. 😁
"Go free."
"This is a lie!!"

Sometimes I  miss chase being in all the costumes, but then I see how good the newer crew can bee, and all is well
Four letter word

Link: “Beans!?”
Rhett: “Is that your answ-“
Link:
Link: Go free, bee! Or whatever, go sting somebody, make honey!
Emily (trying to "escape" to the wall painting): THIS IS A LIE!
Rhett's punishments be like: picked feet and FISH GUTS
Meanwhile link is just... Breakfast
The og beasts will remember this...



BEANS
Rhett:What type of tea is it?
Link:Lipton
LOL
Beans, B-E-A-N-S
Is that your final answer?
Well, Yeahhh
12:34 OMG Rhetts face when link ask if he peed in it.
2:29 “I had a family. You guys took me away from them” 🥺🥺🥺

Rhett’s face at 12:37 was pure gold
Rhett: “I need a final answer.”

Link: ”ELVES”
No one:
Not a living breathing soul:

Link: "Beans"
"Did you pee in this...?!"
Rhett's face was absolutely hilarious 😂😂👍
”BEANS”
   -Famous last word
I love that their characters are so damn depressing, but punny, funny, and weird.
Lookin' at you Randy.
Their personalities are more relaxed having reached summer break.
When Link said "you'd find this in school", I hoped Rhett would say "it smells like a school boy!"
4 letter word 
Link:- Beans
Rhett:- NO are you sure that's your ans?
Link:- Well yeahhh
i will never forget about BEANS
We need more of Em's sass on the show, "you ain't my keeper!"
Don’t Worry No Cows Were Harmed In The Making Of This Video (Sheila Beef)
Lets just take a second to appreciate the last spelling bee when Link said beans when it was guts and forgot what numbers were😂😂
You're walking in the woods
There's no one around and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:
SHEILA BEEF
"Do your best, Bee." 
"You ain't my keeper!"
The “we’re going extinct” pun didn’t get the love I was looking for. Well done bee
I love these smelling games <3
Emily yelling "THIS IS A LIE" about made me choke on lunch XDDD
Shia LaBoeuf, also known as "Shiela Beef"
"What's another thing that's like a sardine?" - "TUNA!!??"
Many kids wanted to be marine biologists. Link was not one of them xDD
I think I'm in love with Emily, her personality is so hilarious, those jokes 😂😂 if she fancied getting married to an Irish dude 😂
Me: ears? They wouldn’t have a bucket of ears duh

Next word: feet 

Me:........
I thought it was a smelling bee eggs challenge...like I was wondering wtf bee eggs smelled like.

I'm not a smart girl.
3:42 "...and Rhett, you got an S and an M to go on."

Links' stuttering here is perfect XD
12:35

Link: Did you pee in this?

Rhett: 
Link is the best friend. Giving Rhett endless hints and encouragement. Rhett is ruthless 😂
The smug satisfied look on Link's face during the 3rd round when Rhett kept getting them wrong lmao...
"I had a family, And you guys took me away from them." - Little Stinker
D-Did you say...JACKSONVILLE?
Rhett’s hair looked so beautiful and soft omg
bee was the higlight of the episode and you cant change my mind
Hey GMM Crew and Mythical Beasts of the world! I was just wondering if maybe y’all could do me a favor and get this comment to blow up so Rhett and Link themselves could see it! Basically, my mom and I have been watching GMM together for a few years now, and it’s always really special to us because of the fact that the videos regularly have subtitles! My mom is deaf and says that being able to enjoy Rhett and Link’s comedy with me is always a highlight of her day, and that the videos having accurate subtitles so often is really darn nice. My mom and I are also planning on seeing the Tour of Mythicality when they stop here in Arizona, which is really momentous for my mom. She’s never been to a concert, nor has she ever cared to seeing as how she’s deaf. But when she saw they added Phoenix, she immediately asked if I wanted to go, cuz she sure did! This is all just really special to me, and I wanted to share my story with all of you, and hopefully Rhett and Link will see it! I would just love if maybe we could find some way to make this concert something my mom will never forget. Thank you all for reading this! Again, all the likes and publicity you can get help! Peace ✌️🤟
Rhett: "We're going to need a final answer."

Link: "ELFS."
12:38 
"Did you pee in this?"
 wide eyes
12:37 Can’t stop thinking about that face 🤣
Link just about recreated the “BEANS” moment, and I love it😂😂
lowkey feeling Rhett's nerdy hair look
Link: already covered in gross stuff
Also Link: alright I'll give you a hint

Woah that's a lot of likes lmao thanks
me: i don't have a favourite
also me: gets mad when link doesn't win
When Link got to the urine, I was laughing so hard I started to cry! XDDD
Esquamulose seriously boy just turn on captions!
smelling bee was my favorite episode. I'm so glad that you guys re-did it
Link in their 1st smelling bee: BEANS
Rhett in their 2nd smelling bee: BEAN
I enjoyed the girl as the bee the most. Lol her lil comments had me rolling in tears
"We´re going extinct."
Such a funny bee.
The Smelling Bee should be a yearly thing just like the Spelling Bee.
Rhett should wear his hair like that more often
when they said birmingham i was so happy i thought they meant birmingham, england, not birmingham USA :((((
Link from the first one: "Ti....ts"
I wanted that to happen again
As a former Scripps spelling bee kid, I can confirm that their wardrobes are ON POINT.
R: "It's something you've drank before"
L: "Did you pee in this!?"

R: 0.0;
Was just in the state of Arizona scrips spelling bee for my school St.Gregory Catholic School
“I’m not doing well”

A W K W A R D   S I L E N C E
Nobody:

Link: R A V I O L I
"It's similar to a sardine." "TUNA!" Excuse me?
I saw spelling bee in the title and immediately had "BEANS!" flashbacks lol
I love Emily!! she is hilarious and adorable like a little button lol
Rhett's eyes and expression when Link guessed urine. Lol.
one of your best. thanks crew
Me: please don’t say ears link
Link: Eels? Eels!
Me: thank god
Link: EEEAAAA-ears I’m going for ears!
Me: Wait no
“IT SMELLS CLEANER!”
I started laughing immediately at that intro
12:35 lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂 👁.👁
13:47
HAH
GOTEEM
THE C WORD
Link:did you pee in this??!?!???
Rhett:👀👀👀
Me:🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Please do more Smelling B's .. loved this and last year's video! 

Keep it up boys
Rhett: We here up together. He’s my best... blank
Link: Plum!
So... I think whoever looked up the hint for feet... has a bit of a search... bias with it after every females name.. lol
“I just feel like I’m tokeing it so hard. Not getting much”

—Link Neal, 2019

Omg Emily is hilarious 😆 "THIS IS A LIE!!!"
Rhett: Assume the position. 
Me: Speaking of S&M...
Esquamulose (definition): Not covered in scales. Having smooth skin.
13:17 Imagine if he got the C correct
first smelling bee- 'BEANS! B E A N S. BEANS!
I love how Emily's bee eyes keep disappearing and reappearing
Link from Target

8:35
Rhett: It smells like old bread
Link nervously smiles
I'm glad that Link pronounced New Orleans correctly.
Yesss I love this game😁👍🏼
8:48 Rhett trying to say "Focaccia" was the best thing that happened to me today
:O Tampa. You be coming to Tampa.  Cool!!!
Emily (or should I say Emibee) is an adorable bee
the confused looking bee is just hilarious! "I miss the outdoors" Hahaha!
Rhett looks so smart in links glasses lol...
They help each other a lot for being in a competition.
I love it ❤️
Ummmm rhett please fix thy hair
Smelling bee another one of my favorite.

Link:   And Rhett, you got and S and an M to go on 
Rhett: Microphone's a little short, thats all I gotta say. 3:43
I see from the comments that I am not the only one who had flashbacks to the great BEANS incident of 2017.
Link: “it smells fruity... root beer!?” What kind of root beer is Link drinking?? 😂
Omg yes y'all are coming to Birmingham Alabama!
I'll never get tired of watching gmm
(Pause at 0:01)
link: son it's time to go to summer camp 
Rhett:
The 2 year wait for a second smelling bee was worth it
Yay I love this game
That bee is life
I was waiting for another one of these!
1st annual-what is your guess?
Link-Beans
Doesn't see it's a 3 letter word
whoever's urine that is, I'm afraid they're dehydrated
Embeely's laughter and Rhett's expressions fuel me with so much joy

OH HOW IVE WAITED FOR THIS
I like how rhett gives link so many hints and chances and link is like
Rhett: Is it S-
Link N O
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 88: "I had a family, but you took me away from them" - Spelling Bee
Rhett: helps link every game 
Link: makes excuse not to help so he can win
Rhett should keep his hair like that
Since ryan reynolds doing a press tour for detective pikachu... Can you have ryan reynolds on your show?
Ears, E-A-R-S. 
Is that your final answer? 
Well, yeahh. Ears!
GRASS
"Ugh, this is fish."
Yay! The first smelling bee is one of my favorite episodes 💗
The "This is a LIE" bit at the end really got me XD
😬 😱  Am outside watching this, and a bee keeps trying to land on my shoulder. Help!
Rhett is Plankton confirmed
Bring back What Are We Smeeling next season!!!
YASS FINALLY!  The original was one of the first videos I ever watched of you guys
I love how neither of them fully did their hair, knowing they'd have stuff dumped on them.

They're both really adorable that way.
I giggled so hard when Rhett and Link said "probaBLEE" together XD
Ah ur coming to New Orleans 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Awww shiet.

"if you can spell esquamulose" (Turn on subtitles)

"DID YOU PEE IN THIS?!"... (cuts to Rhett's face)

Can I just say how much I enjoyed Emily's part in this. The facial expressions were on point!
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK SMELLING BEE!!! And thank you, Rhett, for "Sheila Beef." If I ever need a pseudonym, that's gonna be it.
Link: Did you owe in this?
Rhett: O-O
Emily the bee is so cute

The clip of Link proudly stating “beans” in the last one will forever be stuck in my head
Emily is the best :D
Ohhh Rhett got the Chum Bucket.. :3
Rhett remember when you got mad because of your chair
YESSSS always love the smelling bee
I love how Emily and Jordan have similar humors 😏
YES oh my god I was praying they'd do a sequel
"Beans! It's beans!"
It's a 4 letter word
13:47 look at the board
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
9:55
Would’ve been a perfect time to say bean
Rhett’s hair though, makes him look like cute and soft
"THIS IS A LIE!!"
I love Emily 😂
the bee was like 3 seconds delayed to laugh at jokes >.> every time
Ok... I definitely misheard “stench bench”. I instead heard “stitch-(b word that rhymes with stitch)”
Bee you took me from my family...... Rhett:well take you back
Emily was cute the whole ep.....sorry Rhett Nd link❤
13:47 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Omg yes!!! I watched the first one probably over 15 times, it was one of my fav episodes!

Aww -- Link tried SO hard to find a pun for "bee". A-dorable.
No one:
Emily: I miss the outside
How else remembers Rhett raging about his chair😂😂
Birmingham Alabama?!
Link’s little “Well yeaaaahh” makes my life
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
link can be soo wrong but so confident at the same time
You get a like for referencing The Rock
This was one of my favorite games
link: this is lil stinker the smelling bee bee
drew gooden: enters the chat
Woah smelling bee leveled up with some TV's
I would win everytime I was the smeller
Link is part of a balanced Hawaiian breakfast.
'Beans! B E A N S, beans!.. well yeah!??' Is all I could think about this whole episode.

ok but Rhett looked so good when he put Link’s glasses on 👌👌👌
Always more Emily.
Link gets Urine 2 years in a row, what a lucky guy
Bee: This is a lie!!!

Really wanted them to tell Rhett it was Pringles! Haha. Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
The smelling bee returns!!!! My favorite game they've ever played

Link: It's okay to be wrong 
Rhett: No it's not cause I'll get it dumped on me!
Link: that was a hint 
Me: 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂Lol I can't
i love how they made themselves look like little nerds
Where all the Drew Gooden Lil Stinkers at?
y'alls hair looks so cute when it's not all gelled up
Love this episode! I love this show is still funny after 20 years.
Link looks like a school boy 😂
"It's okay to be wrong" was an amazing hint! So amazing, I didn't even realize it was a hint until he said it was!
@14:06 I think the bee almost barfed on rhett's head
Yaaaaaas . I was hoping this would become a regular / annual thing !
14:09
Rhett thanking his mom as she gives birth to him
Who remembers this?
"BeANs"
Link's outfit looks like he's ready to work His first day at Target
Emily is Bee-st gurl :)
ANOTHER SMELLING BEE!!
My dyslexia brought me here
Emily made this episode!
I love the Bee! Super adorable, bring it back. 😀
YES!!! The first time you did this game is one of my favorite episodes of all time!
Wtf Rhetts hair looks so good combed like that! 😍
I'm loving Rhett’s new hairstyle
They just gave Rhett life lines so link could get stuff dumped on him. I love it
Finally in Houston!!!!!
7:05 gave me a flashback to "It's feet - I made it with my feet!"
Rhett’s hair makes him look like his son haha (Shepherd the youngest)
I love how both Rhett and link had comb overs in the beginning
Emily had my dying all throughout this episode (just like the bees)
Lil Stinker hitting a wall with fake landscape: "THIS IS A LIE!" Lmao
#33 on trending street
Link:"Did you pee in this?"

Rhett: Stares at Link with shocked fiery fury from hell 😂😂
he probably saw the screen. Cheaters.
Links hair looks great 👍🏻
Link lookin' like a (breakfast) snack!
FINALLY ANOTHER SMELLING BEE!!!!
Link u lied about the feet thing cuz I did it and it never happened
link is driving me crazy with all these hints
What if something went up one of their noses lol
The Bee jokes were unexpectedly hilarious
Y E S! I have been waiting for another smelling bee challenge!
3 seasons and 60 episodes age was the first smelling bee
Don't they see the word?? 🤔
Idk who the bee is but I lover her XD
Oh my god.. Emily gives me LIFE ✨✨✨✨
I was so hoping for another smelling bee! Loved it!
Rhett looks like the guys that work at the apple store in NYC
Sheila feet 

Omg it is 😂
I love the captions at 10:03 “Lil Stinker laughs”
When Rhett said "esquamulose".  I turned on my captions to see how the computer spelled it. It put "SQUAM YOU LOWE'S" ; I know Lowe's carries a lot of stuff But I ever seen SQUAM.
Emily is super delightful.  MORE Emily.
Yasss I’ve been WAITING FOR THIS !!!!!
COME TO KANSAS CITY MO!!!!! PLZ❣️❣️
He thought tuna was similar to sardenes? Lol
Yes good, this makes up for yesterday's lack of darts. Also, damn Lucas ever heard of drinking water? That piss is browner than mud.
Lucas should stop drinling all that coffee
4:41 can't they already see the answer?
First episode, Link smells Urine.








Second episode, Link smells Urine.
Man I think they did this on purpose.
How can they be so specific about the brands? Like guessing the tea type.
Notification squad!!!! Good mythical morning and hope everyone has a great day!
People said that they remembered Beans but I remembered T----IS -Link
3:45 a lil s&m Rhett? I'm not surprised 😂. Not crazy bout the new dew tho, sorry. Love and respect.👊
I miss the outside was the best line ever
they missed an opportunity by not calling the other person "the feller" then it could have been smeller and the feller.
Omg do more re episodes!!!
So unBEElievably funny 🤣
Aaaat the 25th annuaaaallllll, PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEEEEEEEEE
I just tested the "autofills when you type any woman's name" - mine didn't autofill that in. It did net worth, kids, husband, age, parents, roles; no feet. 


The interesting thing is, Google tailors it auto complete answers to your previous search interests. 



Me thinks someone in GMM office has a thing for women's feet.
Dude Emily as that bee was the best thing i've seen today.
I love Emily so much
since when is ears a substance
Rhett looked yummy in this episode 🥵😻
BEANS! B.E.A.N.S BEANS!
Lol i always wonder whos pee you all using so i can laugh even harder
I love how Rhett helps Link but Link does nothing
Is it just me or does Emily look really really familiar lol
They're just grasping at straws at this point
Emily looks adorable in that bee costume!!  the look on Rhett's face when
Link said "did you pee in this?" was priceless.  LOL.
smelling bee 2: smell harder
"U ain't my keeper"
those hairdos made my day
That laugh at 10:01 is just magical XD
I love Sheila's feet.
Is every comment about the epic beans fail
best episode of the year by far
Loved this 3000. So fun to watch you guys get chummed lol
Please, please, pleeeeeease do more of this
Someone on the mythical crew has a foot fetish I swear, they bring up feet so much
Yay, a fresh type of video
Y’all giving us the content we need
Are you guys going to do a season 3 of Buddy System? because Season 1 and 2 were so good there has to be a season 3
12:25 LMFAO 😂
When Link asked “Did you pee in this?” Rhett’s face had me crying 😂😂😂😂
Link: gets spam on him
me: feels bad
Link: gets eggs on him:
me: feels bad
Rhett: gets feet and chum on him
me: feels REAL bad
Rank the best pop tart flavors
Yesss! This is my favorite
Link is dressed like he works at target
Not related to the video but I just turned on the tv and Rhett and Link were on the food network 😂
aw man I should've bought my ticket during presale cause now 👇 I gotta wait until 10am

also I hope I can actually purchase a ticket and they don't have a restraining order against me for my puns
Does anyone know what mythical actually means or stands for😂😂
Link keeps giving him too many answers... Lol
Now this was some quality entertainment
Isn’t Sheila Beef the transformers guy?
Is it annual if the last one was in 2017? 😂
Who's excited for the new gmm intro!
The amount of amazing quotes in their videos 👌👌👌
3:07 when people asks how everything’s going.
Rhett chanting:"You can do it Linkster! Come on Linkster!" Bestest friend moment alert!😁
Rhett's face anticipating Link's "Now"😂😂😂
Huge fan. You guys rock.
Shela beef 🤣
A fellow fan of Drew Gooden’s I see!
Rhett's hair makes me so uncomfortable...
sheila beef? the just do it guy?
“be more specific”
they really took it up a notch with dumping items this time.
The real question is how does Rhett keep his hair like that even if it’s been covered in chum and feet
I swear this is one of the funniest episode ever LOL
12:37 When you walk in on your parent's and they just keep it going
“I miss the outside” 🐝
The delayed laugh after Sheila Beef...I can't stop watching it
big is my signature move when i smell my own signature!
Just got my tickets to see y’all in New Orleans!! I’m so excited I CANT WAIT!!
I think their hairs are both like parted differently
Can miss Bee be a regular now just like cotton candy randy xD
Rhett’s face plus Link’s glasses creates the perfect being
I swear this episode used to be titled "vintage smell test"
Man, Link totally chummed in his breeches over that chum...
The now from link made me think of a cat lol
So many "bee" puns left on the table 🙃
These two are just a Japanese game show at this point.
Literally nobody:
Link: Beans
"Beans."
-Link
Link looks like George McFly.
This video was sooooo good, i enjoyed every second.
I miss the outside.🐝
Link and Rhett should do a week of buttoned up polo shirts for back to school
Emily is my fave crew member ☺️
10:23 ah yes Sheila Beef i loved them in Transformers
Rhett’s face when link asked him if he peed in it got me laughing for minutes😂
Lil Stinker is such a Cutie! #Crushin'
CHUM BUCKET
I lost it at 12:37
Lil stinkie could be the next cotton candy randy
Clearly some missing video takes, both your guys hairs is already washed!!!
I would like to see a showering  tutorial from Link after something like this lol 😂
ITS BACK!!! YES!!!
#27 on trending street
damn I spelled esquamulose as isquamulose
Sheila Beef 😂😂😂😂
Nobody:
Link: NOW,NOW,NOW
Nice! They redid an old game :D Try redoing Snack Minesweeper, with even more disgusting foods!
You should react to your first episode of GMM as a special event. Who’s with me?
s n i t c h b i t c h
ok
Sheila beef is shai leboufs discount cousin
Link: Go free, Bee!
Bee: goes to the background wall
Link: That’s a fake wall...
Bee: THIS IS A LIE!!!!😂😂😂
Hey, mythical beast they need to bring back the food debate-O-Rama.
omg that feet hint 🤣
Smelling Bee is one of my all time favorites! So glad it's back!!!
I loved this episode! 💖
smells pee 




Link: C L E A N E R
The first GMM video I watch was smelling be first episode
1:26
Connor McGregor?
Swear to god as soon as link started smelling the grass my allergies kicked in and I had a sneezing fit for 2 minutes
Watched this on my lunch break lol
Yessss,another Smelling Bee Challenge !! The First one is one of my all Time Favorite Episodes
sniff

“Mmm, ravioli”
10:54 thake away the "h"
That bee tho😄💕
Rhett's hair looked good like that for real tho lol
Accidentally arriving early Squad, where we at!
That bee was hilarious.
Ive seen chum.. that ain't chum
Everytime Link has something poured on his head his hairstyle goes from hip dad to grandpa in 0.5 seconds
Yes! I was just watching the first one!! I’m so happy this is happening
Great to see another smelling bee challenge, I keep remembering Link spelling "Guts" as "Beans"
Rhett...are you okay?
I'm happy they did the smelling bee again!
Link looks like a kid who would always comme first in spelling bee😂
This episode is amazing
This episode was really fun! Probably one of my favorite recent GMM episodes
Pls be in summer games
Link you got S&M!
lil stinker must be a drew gooden fan
Emily dressed as a Bee, throwing out a Bee pun instantly has made 2019 worth it.
Please keep recreating old games
He was incoRHETT
You guys should have had Dwayne the rock Johnson on here
hello I am feetus, the word I will be spelling is influenza. I-N-F-L-O-O-O-I-Z-A-A
Yes. We are going to dump ears on Rhett.

Edit: I didn’t expect them to dump feet on him...
Just got my tickets for your show in Albuquerque! Happening the day before my birthday! So excited!
8:08 😂😂😂schoool
Rhett looks really good with his hair to the side!
666k views...... coincidence?
Rhett is such a great friend for giving Link so many hints on that last round.
I. LOVE. EMILY.      !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rofl Rhett's face when Link said, "Pee" hehe
This was on r/hmm
Is Rhett calling it the stitch-b*tch at 0:59?
Notification squad hit like
Emily’s facial expressions during the Gatorade round are everything.
Why is Link number 483?
I wish I had a solving pool in my life! Good mythical day to everyone!
“i miss the outside” lmao
Yes!!! The first smelling bee is one of my favorite episodes!
Loving Rhetts hair!
I knew Emily was going to make the bee thing dark and she did not disappointed me 😂
"Ooh, MACARONI."
the bee was by far the funniest mythical beest
Only og’s remember when links hair wasn’t grey and when they did this episode a long time ago.
More episodes featuring the crew... Fantastic.
When they walk to solve it cant they both just see the items
Rhett is such a good sport with all the hints he gave Link for the last puzzle.
why was link so intent that he was getting ears dumped on him
Emily is as sweet as honey haha see what i did there
Her name should be Phoebee get it
Nobody comes to Jacksonville Ever!!! Im hoping i can get tickets!!!
I love the bee, she’s so funny!
Bahahaha. THIS IS A LIE! 😂😂😂
They should've done beans in rememberance for last year's Smelling Bee.
that feet origin is a lie I typed sarah and google auto completed as Paulson.  I demand a retribution for rhet.
So... you're not coming to Vegas?
(Lil Stinker laughs) hahahahah
This brings back memories.
Love the dwayne Johnson  impersonation. You guys ROCK
my old uniforms look just like links
Lets talk about it~
I have not laughed this hard at a GMM, or really anything, in a while. Thank you guys.
This episode was hilarious!
Emily just standing there bee ing a snack
The bee stole the show for  me this time around.
Me at 10:16: STOP FREAKIN' GIVING HIM HINTS!
That bee looks like lil xan I swear
Y'all can we get a will it Macaron?
YESSS I LOVED THE ORIGINAL SMELLING BEE I'M SO EXCITED
24,000th Like!
that origin of the word feet was wrong
The change in Rhetts hair makes me uncomfortable...
New hairstyle though 😁
I was eating eggs and watching the episode. I should have known better.
Why was rhett's number 001 but links was 483
I should know better than to watch this while I eat
Medical advice for Lucas: Hydrate yourself
Emily's the funniest member of the crew!
It's like if a redheaded Scarlett Johansson was in a Blind Melon video!
SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER😭
Rhett needs to keep that hair style looks 10 years younger..
I love this show but this wasn’t the best episode to watch if you’re already feeling slightly queasy...
I waited so long! But it’s finally here. Can’t wait to laugh my ass off again 😭😂
Today Link's outfit was the tipical dad clothes.
I was just thinking last night they should do another one of these. What luck!
4:19 MY SISTER DOES THIS EVERY TIME I ASK HER TO HOLD MY GLASSES! why do people do that? can a non glasses person please inform me
I like both your guys' hair in this episode
I can hear yoursoloud typing from here
i need to puke bad thing i was watching while eating
I love how Rhett's number was 001 and links was a random number. 483
It's Hering not Herring :D
Dammit, Link, stop offering thousands of hints to Rhett, he never does that for you
It's back!! I was so upset when they didn't do it last year! Please make this an annual thing like the eggs.
Emily's delayed laugh at 10:02 got me
Now we need "Will it Soda?"
plastic straws? c'mon guys :(
Oh god everything looked like vomit!
GMM exists

Rhett: That was my nickname in highschool
emily is so cute in this, her reactions are so much
12:37 so funny
There is nothing you guys can do that will ever compete with that one time ya'll were on Epic Rap Battles of History as Donatello and Leonardo
You should do a will it root beer float
YASS JUST WAKE UP FOR THIS😱😋😋
I love this challenge
If the last one had been a three letter word
I forgot her name, but I love the girl dressed up as a Bee she's adorable lmao
These bee puns are everything
BEANS!  Get it? Haha. Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
Never knew I needed Rhett in glasses until I saw Rhett in glasses
Y U NO COME TO CLEVELAND T.T
I hope that Link has two separate (but identical) glasses, the ones he wears on the show and the ones he doesn't
10:49 I miss the outside
No BEANS....😂😂😂 Poor Emily. Between the lifting and the smells 😋😊😉
Link looking old and dehydrayed
12:37 Rhett’s Face had me dying
i couldnt stop staring at their comb overs lol
The Google Autofill thing is completely incorrect.
How? I just got the notification and there are already over 500 views and 100 comments.
Link seemed way more chill and confident in this... maybe it has to do with his hair.
Kind of like Rhetts hair in this episode
7:58 when I know everything
Rhett's hair looks really nice today :)
It's 6 am and I'm trying to learn Japanese, I just had to watch...
I thought that thing around link's neck was his mullet
little stinker? drew?
I think Bee took some lessons from CottonCandyRandy
Also love, how kind Rhett was to Link in the last round :)
How do people not even watch the video but just wait for the notification to give it a dislike???
Are we just not gonna talk about the hair
Emily makes such a cute bee 🐝
Y'all should do this with carrot top
Something tells me the bee was the least stinky thing, in this episode
T___SSS
Throwback !
i was secretly hoping link would push down on the straws too hard and accidentally snort up the urine
Snack Blackjack and Smelling bee are my favorite games!!!!! please bring them back
My name's Beef, Shila Beef.
"THIS IS A LIE!" Has me in freaking stitches,  S.  T.  I.  T.  C.  H.  E.  S.
I've been waiting for another one!!
Downer bee is my fav
Link looks like he’s got a bruise on the right side of his head
Please do snack blackjack again!
I love the smelling bee! I’m so glad they decided to do it again. Thank you GMM!
Emily is so cute. Look at her in her little bee costume. LOOK AT HER!
Did you pee in this Rhett:😳
sting somebody
... so was curious about the autocorrect "feet" thing... Tried it with Karen's, Taylor's, Lauren's, Ashley's, and Amy's, and none of them showed "feet" as the next thing. Seems unfair. 🤔
Here on 6 views 😄 good mythical lunchtime, guys! 👌 How's everybody doing? 💪
2:29 best bee joke in the whole episode!!
This show always makes me want waffles
B E A N S
So happy that they replayed this game. This is such a unique game and it fun to watch.
i was waiting for another one! i love these
part 2 of smelling bee
Have takeo Ichi on the show
You guys should go home covered in that muk and totally gives the wifes a hug
We need a smelling bee every season
I thought the rock was gonna be a guest star after that opening lol
Y'all are normally so stylish. Why are you dressed like middle school heath teachers
7:37 hahaha
Six hours later
Emily is so adorable
Glad they finally added that h.
"This is s a lie!" made me laugh too hard.
♥
We needed this and more
I love this video so much.
Literally almost gagged at that last one
Are we just gonna ignore Rhett’s hair?
I smell something bad
google fills it after any woman's name LMAO NOOO
B E A N S BEANS
7:37
that laugh tho
them being competitive and cooperative with each other is why i love watching these two!
I've waited so long for another one of these ugh love this series ❤️
Emily and Jordan NEED a show together! The two of them are HILARIOUS!!!
THATS FUNNY I CALL SUMTHN ELSE THE STENCH BENCH!!!
Rhett what happen to your hair going to have to redo the hair song "my hair goes to the side "
Rhett... I’m sorry.. your hair looks like an orange tabby cat is sleeping in your head..
It’s been a while for me, so I haven’t seen his newest hair style yet.
ES... What words could that be? Is it ears? Nah bro GG
Lil stinker should have been chase
No bees were hurt during the making of this video.
The Chum Bucket was in the episode
What's up with Rhett hair it is not perfect like usual
I had a family, you guys took me away from them.

Favorite line
I saw the first over a 100 times because I can't believe that link got "spill your guts" wrong and said beans Hahahaha
You guys making a new opening for next year?
Nobody:
Belle Delphine: 6:50
These are becoming so obviously staged...
The ultimate challenge would to correctly spell and pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch or Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu
can we talk about how they had a chum bucket? 🙃
Before I fart I like to invite those around me into the “smelling zone”.
Emily is the best hahaha
this was so fun to watch and funny 😂 😂
Smelling Bee Bee and Cotton Candy Randy should be in the same episode
These games seem fixed cause they all seem to have the same outcome
I wouldn't mind having egg rolls with my thanksgiving dinner.
Bread is fing Toast ...
Wasn't the last smelling bee 2 years ago, that means it's not annual.
You see this comment? Have a GOOD myyyyyythicallll MORNING!!💚💚💚
Woah, there. Have you been scrolling too fast?



How about you stop and spell the roses?
Totally should've used raw eggs
Lucas needs to drink more water
Emily is the best bee I've ever seen.
Anyone else remember when they did this a couple years ago?
Im kind of digging Link’s new hairstyle
B E A N S
B E A N S
I guess Rhett had a CHUM BUCKET spilled on him.
“Beans! B-E-A-N-S! Beans!”





Hahahhahaha og’s will get it
B E A N S
anyone else actually like rhett's hair at 0:56?
14:00 guys look it’s the chum bucket
Oof they spelt "Spelling" wrong in the title! That must be super embarrassing.
Rhett’s hair was looking good
Because I’m on vacation
Plz do an international Starbucks taste test
Don’t like how they are bringing technology into these games I miss the traditional way of playing.
@8:48 Emi-bee's laugh is so adorable.
4:04 proudest face ever
whoever that Bee was she was great, pls have her on the show more!
BEANS! B-E-A-N-S! BEANS
COME TO CANADA
Hiiiiiii please gimmi shoutout if you love them gimmie likes BABYS 👶
I call bs. Unfair.
13:47 ....an interesting screenshot
Link has a very odd google algorithm
This is the best concept in the entire gmm repertoire
Not fair really.  Link is at a disadvantage in contests that require use of the senses,  motor skills,  or decision making.
I LOVE THEIR HAIR IN THIS S O FREAKING MUCH!! like I’ve always wanted this to be how they do their hair 😭 it makes them look so much cuter and younger
Yay a new smelling bee
The chum hunt was 100 times easier than the feet clue
JANSNNS
It’s my Birthday mythical beats!!😊🥳
Can you do another video on putting things in somthing for a month
Petition for freeing the bee
Oh God that tongue action at the beginning
I'm a simple man
I see Link suffering
I click
For a second I thought they were gonna be smelling the insect not like a pun about spelling bees
I miss the outside
god i wish i could do this to my bosses too
Tell Lucas to drink more water
Such a good show!
okay, on whose autofill is feet coming up when you type any woman's name? not my autofill...
Used a lot of plastic straws for this one.... in the future would appreciate if you didn't
12:35 haha
I love the bee girl's laugh especially after "Sheila beef"
Great episode!
12:37 Sansa when Jon tells her his secret
that is some dark piss they need more water
rhetts hair makes me think he's a boy scout
Wait a second.. they had a bucket of chum, a chum bucket if you will
Can you bring back the color blast  game
ok but honestly they should've sung the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee song in the title :( am disappoint
I wouldn’t been good at this smelling game because my allergies are so baddd 😂
They dont seem "normal" in this ep
Lucas needs to drink more water my god
Rhett's hair swoop makes him look older. Lol
The other fish like Sardines= Tuna. A giant fish.
I miss Snack Blackjack
6:44 - GG . He tried though
I... tried that hint that rett got... It did not work.
6:52 The lick.
This is so funny! 😂😂😂
Should have been asbestos
Finally!!
Can we get a little stinker and cotton candy randy crossover
Are those the same tubs that the game grumps played in🧐🧐
Pls do another
Is Quanah Lowe’s
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Link gives Rhett more hints then he gets
This is a lie!
Please tell me the crew really is union.  As a union member myself that would make me so happy.
This is a lie, love her
Emibee was good this episode
How is no one talking about rhetts face when link asked if he peed in the glass? I'm dying
Rhett looks good in glasses
1:32
probabee
OMG RHETTS HAIR
9:10 - Does Link have a bruise on his right cheek??
I would like to enter a spelling bee contest because I would get 100%
What coffee is link drinking, and where the frick can I get some
i like wyatt s hair today
I wished for this two days ago and today here it is and I've officially concluded that I have magical powers, I will only use these powers for good. My second use of this power: eternal smelling bees.
Is no one gonna talk about Rhett's hair??? It looks good
Oh that giggling bee!
Nobody's gon talk about how good Rhett looks with his hair side parted?
Sheila BEEf
Rhett’s swoop-y hair is as amazing as ever.
Sheilas beef 😂
Do another fancy fast food
LOL eels, link cannot spell
Why Rhett links hair flat
Rhett is lookin sophisticated af
Me sitting here in north Carolina: tour plz?
The funniest part of the video is the bee trying to leave via the mural and yelling “THIS IS A LIE!”
Did you pee in this? 12:36
anyone else cringing when the straws go into their nose lol
They did it FINALLY
Did Rhett change his hair or something
i have this theory that link knew what the last word was. I cant put my finger on what gave it away, but I just know he did.
Rhett’s hair tho
Why did Rhett's hair change, and also... It's not his normal style that he swore he'd never change
Is anyone gonna talk about rhetts hair
13:35 Rhett’s face is just completely done lmao
13:27 that rogue foot
yeah I lost my lunch today.. thanks guys.... ugh....
Whoever's pee that is needs to get hydrated
Any last words? Dracarys
I think Lucas needs to drink more water... yikes
12:37. Rhett's face lol.
When they go over to the guessing pool cant they see the answer??
They brought the letter count down to 4 so Link would have a chance
Links face at 8:37 😂😂
12:37 I’m WHEEEEEESING SKSKSKSKSKSKSKSK
Please please do these more often
I’m in Tampa wish I could come I’m 13 and I have been watching since I was 11  your awesome
As a side note, $235 is too much for a show ticket, I'm afraid.
12:37 LMAO just pause there, take a screen shot and make it your wallpaper
14:01 Bee’s face when she is dumping the chum bucket! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
lucas needs to drink more water...
And then reht gets a life line tf
12:37 when your mom questions you about your browser history
I really enjoy Emily
This is so funny
who's every computer u used must have a foot fetish, cause that auto fill thing isn't true
at 12:37 be like what you say to me?
Emily yes 🙌
Link looks like josh peck
Link has to be the weakest nose i've ever come across.
I enjoyed Emily's puns
Little stinker should've offered both of them a hive-ive
Bruh they should have had the rock in this episode I’m disappointed 😂
I tried several ladie's names and google never suggested feet. What's the joke im missing?
Hahah they look like spelling beee champions
Is nobody gonna mention the foot fetish thing
Oh cool I watched the first smelling bee last week!
I wish they did honey 🍯:(
It’s my birthday!
SMELL IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Y’all gave him urine again feelsbadlink
Whoever produced that urine may want to see a urologist or nephrologist...  Urine that concentrated can often signal kidney disfunction.  He could have also just been dehydrated, but either way, urine should be pretty clear. Love the show!  -Pharmacist
I love Emily as a bee!
Lol Emily - I'm sorry, Lil' Stinker - looked so perturbed at Link at 5:45
0:59 I kept thinking he was saying the stitch bit** but I kept going back and heard stench bench
by the end of this links going to be carrying around a breakfast
what's with their hair???
this is the hardest i’ve laughed at one of their videos omg it ended and i’m still laughing
Little stinker?? Where’s Drew Gooden??
Rhett helped Link a lot
Rhetts hair?!
UH



RAVIOLI
Link looks good dressed like that
You can try to hide Emily in a bee costume, but her energy cannot be contained
Who cleans this
Ysll got new hair cuts?
I love this game
By the 7 minute mark Link looks like a breakfast in Guam or Hawaii
It seems like there's something on Link's mind that bothers him, he doesn't look happy. Are you alright Link?
That hairstyle actually suits Rhett.
Haha remember BeAnS
What on earth happened to their hair
I like Rhett’s hair during the smelling bee
If i were Rhett i might be guessing SLAM,SLIM,STIM, STEM 🌚
Sheila Beef
Nobody is going to talk about their new hairdos?
I see link didn't forget to count the letters this time.
lmao my dogs name is chum
I love Emily!
Yaaaay smelling bee!
They so cute 😍
'Sheila beef' will be the name of my new dog
That was a bit of a Red Herring there Rhett....
That was hard to watch
I believe that there was too much help in this video. Don't get me wrong I loved it, but giving each other obvious hints made it so you guessed the letters easier
Little stinker was really funny
I miss Smelling Bee
She looks so cute in that bee suit 😁
I have been binge watching GMM for almost exactly a year, and I’m finally up to date... It’s somewhat upsetting, because now I have to wait for the next episode, just like everyone else... unacceptable. Overall, I’m loving the subtle jokes that hint towards all the global issues (such as the bee going extinct joke, and climate change was brought up in some other video).
Em as a bee is funny lol
12:37 for Rhett's all-knowing eyes!
Rhett's lookin alittle chonky
Why do they both look so much younger in this one?
Wait. I thought that plastic straws were illegal in California where they live?
thats not chum
I love Emily 😄
THIS IS A LIE!!
Link is too nice and gives Rhett way too many chances
I was eating while watching this
THANK GOD
Why do i watch it while eating
8:37 Link looks like he would be doing literally anything else than filming GMM.
Do vegetables have fruits?
Whoever peed in that jar needs to drink some water.
What happened to Rhett's hair???
Emily looked liked she was going to barf when she poured the chum on rhett lol
What happened to their hair😨
i'm nauseated
Beans b-e-a-n-s beans
13:25 what is that falling on Rhett?
I was JUST watching the last smelling bee last night!  This is trippy, man, haha.
guess you could say that was a chum bucket
Omg all the straws what about the turtles
Yes I’m glad this is a yearly thing
THIS IS A LIE
Shia Labeef
Clean up aisle gmm!  What a stinky mess!
Rhett looks just like shep with his hair like that!
🐝EmiBEE🐝
I garage they had to sleep in hotels before they were allowed home after this episode.
What’s the twitch  can you put a link
Neeeow
I love that they did their hair like their mom's did their hair.
rhett's hair really captures his midlife crisis
Why tf is the urine so dark
I have the exact same shoes as lil stinker the bee!!
I cannot wait to see you guys in Birmingham. I really really hope I can afford the VIP tickets to see you guys. It would be a true dream come true for me.
Read this as smelling bee eggs 😂
Did Rhett swear at 1:04??
My God that irks my nerves so bad. Rhett gave Link enough hints for him to get urine, yet Link wouldn't give him Toast after Rhett said bread. That really upsets me. Yes Link usually loses most of the time, but fair is fair.
Egos?
12:37 wtf is that face
How are they going to dump ears on him?
b e a n s
Rhett looks like connor with  that haircut
I love that Bee
“THIS IS A LIE!”
Can you guys go to Pennsylvania?
This is why we don't have smellevisions
actually if you write any womens name it wont auto fill "feet"
Y’all need to do “Will It Pudding” !!!
Rhett just got dunked on by the Chum Bucket!!!
Anyone else want to scream at link that he's giving too much away on rhett's turn?
I love Emily please feature her more
Its episodes like these that make me glad smell-o-vision isnt a thing yet
Can’t believe this was published today. I’m NEVER early on GMM videos
13:13 my brain : mum
whoever's that pee is needs to drink more water
I am intrigued how Rhett got smelly cheese from Pringles and Link got Fish from grass... Same spot too, maybe it was contaminated
I rewatched for the “Beans” and the Bee commentary lol “THIS IS A LIE” lol
Rhett's hair in this one was superb.
Seems like Rhett always gets the better end of the deal in these games.
I vape. One of the biggest innovations is airflow and hole placement. I think you have to drill a hole near the bottom in the side so air gets pulled up. Right now you are grabbing air from above rather than a nice vortex lifting from the bottom.
Why is 96% of this show's content so gross??
Can they not see the 4 letter words literally right beside them when guessing?
Is Rhett’s freakout real
Is it just me or does Rhett seem unhappy?
difficult episode to eat to ...
Rhetts hair... oh god
583,372nd view
They gave him urine twice hahahaha that's great
Hey guys, you should have Ashton Irwin and/or his band (five seconds of summer) as a guest on here. I really want to see Ashton on here, thank you!
You guys can definitely do more repeating challenges and new takes on previous will its, I’ll most definitely watch them.
3:11 "bee"lieve in your self lol
"Any time you Google a female's name, this word pops up after"
Thinks back to If Google Was a Guy
Why do they look like school boys in this
This episode has a weird vibe to it
Emily is delightful. I like her.
Sheila feet
Lol @ rhetts hair
13:47 nice
Chum is fum
Why is their hair flat
Did Rhett not do his hair because he didn't want any of the product to burn his eyes if he got dumped on?
at the end, it looks like Rhett and link were in a food fight
Link was quite kind and generous in this one. I guess once you have a bunch of yuck dumped on you, you don't mind more.
b e a n s
Normally I prefer Chase being the one in the ridiculous costume, but, Emily didn't disappoint.
Is this real
These games are so much more entertaining than watching you guys rank steaks
I need to stop laughing so hard it’s 3 in the morning
Is Link bruised?
14:10
Yay cool
Emily looks so cute in the bee dress!
T.....ss
Rhett gave WAY too many hints for me to be satisfied 😂 I wanted link to lose
Eat glass
Do they not know they're playing at spelling bee? They're just guessing random things on the board up their clearly shows what they need.  Maybe I'm crazy
The energy is weird in this. Are they sad or something?
12:35 youre welcome
staged
Uh, is no one gonna say something about Rhett's hairdo change at 0:52 ?? 😯
If they just turned around they would see the answer....
BEANS!
WHAT THE ROCK. IS. COOKIN
😂😂😂😂
Does Rhett seem shorter when they get into the smelling bee? Hmmm...
I'm in much pain and cry just getting to the bathroom. But this episode was so funny that I didn't mind the spasms of pain every time I laughed.
I disliked this video because they used plastic straws.......... but I still love them
Sheila beef
Shelia Beef
Cmon link ,eggs was sooo easy
有趣
Emily is so funny!
nice hair guys
What did they do to Rhett's hair?
This smell originates from Google auto fill??????
We need a weekly Jordan and Emily show now. Please.
so the answer was to their left <.<
Why couldn't Link have gotten the Caesar Dressing on the chum round along with the other two he got
What is happening with the hair? Did I miss something?
Again!
Rhett’s hair is becoming links old hair
Couldn't they see the word they were supposed to guess on the table when they walked to the pool?
esquamulose
snifffffffff RAVIOLI
Rhett basically gives Link all the answers and Link gives nothing back. Not cool Link.
Rhett's hair looks like his sons lol
Ti...ts
Did anybody else stop at 12:37 to take a screenshot?
Anyone else catch the toking comment hahahahaha
Can I please use the smell in a sentence
The cut to Link after being spammed....he looks like a lunch lady
can smell it through the coomputer
I love it
“THIS IS A LIE”
Do you have any medical advice for Lucas?? hahahhahaha!
Good hair rhett
I wanna go to your tour but I can’t ;(
An s and a m? Kinky
BEANS
BEANS
can you smell what the rhett is cooking!
Link looks like he works at target
Not sure who's urine that is but it's very dark looks super unhealthy 😖
BEANS
BEANS
BEANS
Hair.
Honestly one of my favorite episodes in a while- there’s so much humor packed into this and no ones trying hard to be funny
Finally
😂😂👏👏
I like Rhett’s hair like that
I’m having de ja vu
What an awkward but hilarious bee-ing is that host
Which Google autofill are you using?
Just typed in Sheila's F and got {flowers, fancy, florist, fiance suits, florist mexborough].
You said it worked with any girl's name, so next came Patricia's {florist ringwood, flowers, flower shop, florist pimlico, florist}
Jane's {fighting ships, fleet command, fighting aircraft, fighting ships PDF, fighting ships 2019}
Louise's {farm kitchen, florist, flapjacks, fiskebar(*), fish and chips}   (* - that's a restaurant in Denmark)
I think you're seeing a general pattern here, but the smell is a whole lot nicer than feet.
the bee is sooo funny <3 bring the bee back!!
chum bucket
This is crazy i watches the last episode of the smelling bee last night and someone commented they wanted it back and here it is lol
What is going on with links  hair
Why do they always have Lucas pee when they need urine? HHe's the same guy whose urine they used in the Liza Koshy episode.
The smelling beebee.
Okay link.  Stop giving Rhett all the answers 🤦🏻‍♀️
Make more videos like this!!
Emily and Jordan are the funniest crew members by far. They're both just naturally hilarious. We need Emily in more episodes!
Emily’s face at 14:00... 🤣🤣
Love the hair, also, I remember this!
YESSS I LOVED THE FIRST EP OF THISSSS
I've been waiting for them to do another Smelling Bee!!! Had some of the funniest moments in the first one! I'm so happy!!
This is reminiscent of the Mario Game Grumps episode.
I was waiting for Link to mess up like last time
Rhett looks good with his hair more flat.
Houston? Austin is not pleased.
They’re doing a concert an hour away from me the day before my birthday and of course the tickets are just insane. Oh well
Link is kinda a sore loser 😂
pause at 14:07 thats all i need to say
Why does Rhett look like the teacher I had for biology 😂
I like that funny Bee. she's cute.
Rhett looks like a tour guide to a hiking trail with that haircut, and outfit on.
thank you WWW.wikifeet.com
the girl in the bee costume was great
sturstromming is herring
Link looks like he runs a department at Target
Rhetts hair looks amazing 😂
Any last words? 

"DACARYS!"
"I had a family. You took me away from them."
You ain't my keeper!
First Beans, now Ears. Geez Link, you are not good at this XD
Rhett looks good in glasses too..😉
Sheila Beef = Shia LaBeouf
Best. Episode. Ever.
The bee brought the whole entire video together
Oh my god the bee character made me laugh so hard
NEW HAIRCUTS!!!
They seem to guess awfully correct even when they have no idea... Seems they must get more help than we think..
YAY SMELLING BEE
the google trick not working for me
Awesome episode
Oh... I thought they were going to smell bee eggs. 😳
BeAnS
12:58 Ooh, Ravioli
It's my birthdayyyy
Link:  Did you pee in this? 

Rhett: 👀
Thanks for answering mah prayers and doing another!
“This would be in SKOO.”
“In SKOO?”
“In SKOO “
This is a really good episode
i miss the outside baghahaha! love her!
Lmao lil stinker. I love the smelling bee
I miss the outside 😂
Shoutout to the foot boys.
They brought back the smelling bee, up next, The debate-o-rama.
Just watched their last smelling be last night this is surreal
Emily is awesome
THIS IS A LIEEE
FOQUACCHIA
Yo the feet fact is false lmao
Everyone’s remembering the ‘beans’ part of last episode but I’m just thinking ‘T.....s’ lmao is that even from that episode
Ooh RAVIOLI
nope feet does not show up as an auto fill for sheela. Rett. I tried it.
I wish the host was apart from them cause link didn’t help Rhett at all
Where the cat shirts at?
Rhett’s face at 12:37 😂😂
I love that Rhett get's Monster and Erasers but Link gets URINE AND SOCKS
Rhett's hair kept distracting me. It was trying to go down even before he got dumped on. If he grows it out long, they can sing the hair song again and just switch parts!
you guys are giving Dan Avidan some ptsd flashbacks
I WAS LITERALLY JUST WATCHING THE FIRST ONE EARLIER WISHING Y'ALL WOULD MAKE A PART 2
BOY HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
Shila Beef, is that on office reference?? 😂😂 true fans will get it
This is one of my favs in a  long time. You can tell they are just having fun ( ∩ _ ∩ )
I miss the old intro music "/
Emily is always a great addition, her and Cotton Candy Randy's stunt double are hilarious
The first smelling bee was more smelly
They're using the same box for the jars. So the strong smells are gettin through the rounds
DAMN LUCAS!!! drink more water!!!!!
12:37 ... my life is complete now 😂😂😂😂😳😳😳
omg that urine was sooo dehidrated....
Emily sure does look beeutiful today
The first smelling be was 1 year ago!!!!
Ew. But party game!
Old school Rock intro.
The Rock really needs to be invited to the show to play this game!! Oh, better yet, return the Game Grumps so Dan can get his revenge!! 
Rhett's hair looks great in the smelling zone!!
4 letter word
Link: Beans
Rhett: NO are you sure that's your answ?
Link: Well yeahhh
I feel like I'd be really good at this. I'm very good at identifying smells. 
One time it smelled really weird while driving to the gym and my bf asked 'what's that smell?' and to me it smelled like boiled corn. I told him what it smelled like and he was like wtf?! that's exactly what it smells like! lol
Rhett: gives 40 hints + 3 tries
Link after Rhett’s first sniff: alright move it along
YOU AIN'T MY KEEPER!
Everything was much slimier than I imagined in my head.
lmao i love how link was covered in egg the entire episode !! hahaha!
I actually think all of these are beans
GREAT episode, guys 😂
*Link is part of a complete breakfast*
i love the touch of dark from stinker - bring on the cotton candy randy show this summer!
Rhett's hair <3
Hair game strong
This is so funny
I tried a bunch of names. None of them had feet after them in google
2:36 she’s the perfect bee
Link looks like a grandpa.
Your hair is looking extremely flat today. Lol not as puffed up as usual. Both of you! Haha
Who was the bee, she’s funny
How many other people disappointed when they typed in a womans name and it didnt fill in with "feet"? Where'd they get that one from???
They should have eminem on this show and the video should be about rapping. Who agrees with me.
Link: "Imagine if they did this in the real spelling bee"
Me: "That's the only way I'd watch it"
Emily is the cutest bee 😭 I love her so much
Shiela feet




SHE LOVE FEET
ELFS???? It's ELVES!!!!!!
B E A N S
BEANS
If they could put Emily's personality in a bottle, I'd buy a dozen cases... She's just awesome.
They seem a lot happier this time ❤❤ just want two favorite people to be happy
That was freaken amazing
You should react to your old videos
How did they make those with straws, if they live in California..?
Why link look like the wheelchair guy from Scary Movie 😂
Yes I missed this
Links new hair supplements
I'm sorry what's with the hair????
I tried the google thing it’s a lie.
You two wearing wigs today?
This wall is a lie!! Hahaha I love GMM
Rhett's

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER SMELLING BEE FOR SO LONG YESSSSS

When you realized this is the last video of gmm and you have to wait for 2 weeks to watch another precious gmm video
Yasss smelling bee is back 🐝

How did it take me so long to find these guys, I’ve been missing out for years
Rhett got Plankton's restaurant dumped on him.
Rhett's hair!!!!
I think I have a new dream. To be a random character on a GMM episode.
Wait this isn’t the first time Link has mentioned grass smelling like fish
"Beans"
Rhett hair 🤭
YESSSSSS
Was I the only person that was like “I had no idea that bees laid smelly eggs”?
nOw
Gatorade is not a smell...
Oh my god I’m so happy
Is mythicality a word???  No, it’s not.
I love this series make more of these. But can we all agree that Link and Rhett are having a bad hair day 😂😂😂
For some reason I want  a longer version of this! I can't stop laughing!
yall are cruel btw XD
Rhetts hair looks gorgeous today.
Shia LeBouf
Sheila Beef
You know that movie Idiocracy?
GMM is one of the few American shows that'd be perfect for kpop idols to come to... it's like a variety show
Actual Chum bucket at the end lmao
I feel like they can see the word on the stand that standing right next to their pools...?
I love Rhett's hair when he is smelling
Come on link EARS?? Should have known it would be actually something that smells bad that could be dumped on you. Ears??? Lol
gosh dang emily is so funny
Emily at 14:02 lol
I’m just disappointed they don’t have the Velcro letters Rett couldn’t figure out
How many of us tried the google auto fill toast thing?
Escuamyelose?
Sheila Beef, the kid in the first transformers film?
She was funny!
Can't they cheat by reading the word...
‘Smells like vegetables’ : egg rolls
YES! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER ONE OF THESE!
me: how would they be out here dumping ears?
next round: feet
me: oh-
Ive been waiting for another episode of this series for so long. You should definetly play it more often.
I LOVE the smelling bee! also, Emily is hilarious to watch when they are guessing. her face gives so much away!
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Love the grade elementary school combover look haha
Rhett looks like Tanner from Dope or Nope 😂
Emily is too damn cute
I just need Emily the bee to be around more often
12:37 this is already a meme face here 😐
She reminds me of Meredith Palmer from The Office 😂😂😂
I think I misstaken chum with other word without H, to much internet for today
Rhett gave so many hits compared to link. If he didn't help link that much he wouldn't have had that chum spilled on him.
Sheesh... You guys sure came up big!
"What's that thing that's like a sardine?" TUNA.... yeah except Tunas are WAAAAAY bigger.
This was a fun one.
Omg YES.
YESSS. I’m so happy they did a second one :D
THIS IS A LIE
I think they should have given Link the word "Beans" for his round in reference to the last smelling bee.
I love the bee it reminds me of Barry from The Bee Movie 💙💙
God I love Emily. 😂🤣😂🐝
"A four letter word that begins with S, that you wouldn't want tipped over you?" Mmmm lol
Everyone laughing when Link says he has S&M
“I miss the outside 🙃”
It is my birthday today and loved last times smelling bee, so this is like an awesome birthday, but also I superglued my fingers…so
love the video! When are you guys coming to Maine?
Rhett's hair is so cute today
They can see the smell station when they’re guessing the word
ITSSS BACCKKKKK
toast is bread
iridocyclitis
Chum is Fum
THIS IS A LIE
Emily is an absolute national treasure.
hi 840
I'm new to GMM but I've been binging them for a week
This will BEE disguSTING.
i typed in shelia's on google and it did not autocomplete the word "feet"
Please please please do another snack blackjack video!!
Im so happy this came back
H-a-p-p-y happy
I live 4 hours from New Orleans
I loved the first of these so FINALLY :D
"I miss the outside" lol
3:07
Me almost everyday of my life
You guys never stop in atlanta 😢
ive been waiting for this!!!
I tried multiple womens names and none of the autofill was "feet" not even in the top 5 autofilled options....just saying.
So they didn’t gussy up there hair for this good thinking
12:35 did he?
I give Emily a B plus!
Is anyone on here talking about Rhett's hair
Wheres the drew Gooden fans aka little stinkers
13:59 it's the Chum Bucket
BEANS
BEaNs
Rhett celebrates whenever Link get a right answer and encourages him and gives him multiple attempts to get the right answer. Lol, but... Link gives Rhett nothing haha
I wonder if Rhett and Link will ever come to the Eastern Shore on a meet and greet? Or maybe they already have a few years ago. Hi, to all you guys who live on the east coast of the U.S., Maryland represent.
My concern is that the speller could easily see the the board with the answer on the side of them
Typing "Sheila " into Google turns up "Sheila e" for me.  There aren't any "feet" anywhere in my search box.  Someone on the Mythical crew is searching for some strange things...
🎶Where, in the world, did the dart throwing aspect of this game go 🎶
was expecting

"where in the world do these international potato chips come from"
“Im going into LÏck DÂdDŸ mode” 😂😂😂
I was so ready for “where in the world do these international chips come from?”
Wait, doesn't the US have paprika chips? That's like the 'default' chip flavour here in Belgium.
I was hoping this was going to be a "Where in the world do these international chips come from?" game.
Rhett: What's your favorite flavor
Janel: Salt & Vinegar
Me: I like her already
I think we need Robert Downy Jr or Scarlett Johansson on the show now, or Chris Evans 🤷🏻‍♂️ it’s time
can yall please put in the title when u have a guest on?
I didn't actually know who Janel Parrish is, but she was an excellent guest!!
A GMM international food taste test that doesn’t involve dart throwing? Blasphemy!
Lays should partner with McDonald’s and make a Mac Sauce chip
Dear Rhett and Link,

Your best episodes include competition between you two. This episode had dart board all over it.
3:37
 "you tryna get me to go down under"
"We'll see, we'll see"
"We'll talk later" 
Damn😂😂
Link performing CPR on the chip bag was definitely a highlight. Lol
Where is Chase the cartographer?? And the darts?? You can't do an international taste test without either!!
“See the flavor, taste the nostalgia.” -Chio Paprika
Wait there is no paprika flavoured chips in America??
Ah man was hoping for Where in the World Do Theseinternationalchipscome From
"Wow, look at the flavor"
 
"Don't you taste the nostalgia?"
 
--Rhett 2019
An international taste test without dart throwing is like dunking oreos in lemon juice! Just not right.
Them bickering over India and Pakistan made me laugh so much. Yes. Thank you.
Rhett must eat low-quality paprika. Paprika chips are AMAZING.
The character that the chip mustache seemed to transform Link into feels like a throwback to Michael Scott from The Office . . . nostalgic
Paprika chips packed with flavour
These guys have never eaten em good chips
Me: "looking at title"
GM: It's time for...
Me: where in the worl...
GM: If we take an international tri...
Me: "Face of betrayel smh"
"one of the best things canada has given us"

BUT WILL IT POUTINE?
what! Ketchup chip are a Canadian thing? Being Canadian I jus thought it was part of the holy trinity of chip flavours.
I grab a stack of about 10 Pringle’s and stuff em’ in my mouth
Absolutely no one:
Link: pops a Lays bag in celebration
saw title, got excited, made coffee, got comfy, pressed play.....its not a dart throwing episode....guys....

cries into coffee
Janel is such an awesome guest!!! She needs to come back!!!
I always thought Ketchup crisps were british the more you know!
As good as ketchup chips are, All Dressed chips are Canadas superior chip flavour.
I realized I loved my mother country when I screamed "Yay" when they had my favorite chips, "Masala Magic"... Also couldn't be happier that Link was the only one who got it right! And when he was trying to pop the bag I was like "No, no they never open the right way my friend."
International chips:
Dart Board: aM i A jOkE tO yOu??
Rhett: Lays Ketchup is the best thing that Canada has offered to us.
Maple syrup: Am I a joke to you?
"paprika doesn't have a taste, just a flavor"
Almost Everyone: Wheres the Darts!? Wheres the theme song?!

Just me: Finally! Cotton Candy Randy now has a Pin!
Im going into lick daddy mode... No one should say that so casually
What is this non-dart involving international taste test
Fun fact: Chicken Tikka Masala actually originated in England.
Link: Ima be a lick daddy

Janel: do it get in there
My Italian ass was waiting for the San Carlo chips.
Diff n distinct lays flavour of every country but slanty of pakistan.... 🤦🏻‍♀️
Excited for Janel 😆

Thoroughly disappointed in the lack of Chase and darts 😭😭😭

Why u do dis to us?!?!?
International chips:

Dart board: Am I A JoKE To yOu
"Flavour you can see" is the tagline for shapes in Australia
Rhett says: I sure hope I win the six year supply of international chips.
Janel and Reth clicked immediately, and then there was link ..
Bummer. I thought we were gonna get another Link loss at darts.
Link with a chipstache is Cotton Candy Randy’s archnemesis
"I don't know if I like it but I do keep eating it 😏".. Story of  my life Link 🔗 I do understand 😂
Link was like 3rd wheeling this episode lmaoooo
I would expect the paprika chips to be made in Hungary not Germany
IM SO UPSET. International food dart board are my favorite episodes
Trust me. I can tell the flavor of a chip from feeling it!
You can clearly tell that Janel likes Rhett more than Link. So SAD.
rhett : one of the best things canada has given us
insulin : am i a joke to u
6:15 India vs Pakistan lol
Half the comments: Janel is the best guest ever.

The other half: WhErE aRe ThE dArTs
I honestly thought ketchup chips were made in the US too... us Canadians are lucky to have the best by our side🤷‍♂️
You guys should have a MET gala themed episode with all of the crew dressing up according to the theme of the gala. Make it an annual thing too
Old Dutch has better ketchup chips than Lays 🤷🏻‍♀️
Was so excited it was going to be a dartz one...
Dipped my regular lays in ketchup before this was a thing
CHEESE AND ONION TAYTO ARE THE BEST AND ALSO MAKE A GREAT SANDWICH 👍💚🍀🇮🇪
I’m counting this as an international taste test video. So... 

International Taste Test Scoreboard (before this video): 

Rhett: 10
Link: 5
I want an episode two of the international ship taste test!!
Woah woah woah! An international taste test with no darts?!


What did Link do now? 😂
Blasphemy we need the international food taste test
Im Canadian and when I saw the Canadian chip I was yay Canada and then Rhett be like this is only one of what Canada gave us🤣🤣🤣☹️☹️☹️☹️😓😓😓😤😤😭😭😭😢😢😢
Wait is Paprika not a regular chip flavouring in America?????
I live in the Netherlands and it's just kind of the standard flavour everyone goes for
Link was kinda right tho, both chips taste the same
I thought this would be a dart episode :(

That said, Janel was a great guest!
Y'all should get Davey Havok from AFI and ect. To be on here, it would be fun, amazing, and he is a truly beautiful person.
I clicked hoping to see ketchup chips, and they happened to be the 1st chip. They’re my favourite ❤️❤️
I felt negative vibes from that guy with glasses
#19 at Trending! Congrats!
WHAT DO WE WANT? Where in the world do these international chips come from!!!

WHEN DO WE WANT IT? Now!!!

i gotta say i was disappointed it wasn't a darts game :-(
Oii 🇨🇦 Canada has offered hockey, basketball you name it.
Old Dutch ketchup chips are a million times better than Lays
You should do a will it meal you make an entire meal but every food must have the same base ingredient.
Link: It's time for!
Me: WHERE IN THE WORLD-- aw... :(
Everyone's complaining about the lack of darts but no one's talking about how nice and pleasant the guest was.
Paprika chips are easily the best chip ever. God I miss Germany lol
☹️



You guys already know what I’m sad about..



But at least links THAILAND is back
I would have loved to see Janel trying to hit countries on the map-board. 
PS: She's so niceeeeeeeee and chill.
I kinda feel like darts should have been involved.
i got so excited for a new dart-throwing international taste test. wtf gmm?!!!
Try maichi dude chips from Indonesian.
Very very great taste.
Its delicious
Thanks for almost pronouncing Pakistan right guys😂💙
Janel? I thought that was Miranda Cosgrove
im from canada and i LOVE ketchup chips 😍
Am I the only one who doesn't enjoy the guest-episodes?
Salt and Vinegar is always the best XD
Pretty sure I've seen ketchup chips in Maine lately.
8:41, Link suddenly got 4 points? Lol, I finished watching and got my question answered haha
YES i love salt and vinegar
No one: 
Absolutely no one: 
Not a single soul:
Link everytime: tHIgH-LaNd that's how my dad says it haha
THANKS FOR SELECTING PAKISTAN 🇵🇰 REALLY LOVE YA GUYS ❤❤❤
You should have done Patatje joppie chips for the Netherlands.
Ketchup chips are my favorite! Thankfully, I live in Canada and can always purchase them!
janel is so wonderful i love her
We are not trowing darts... LETS TALK ABOUT THAT
Old Dutch Ketchup chips are better from Canada!
Rhett's denim jacket make me feel feelings
Nobody:
Rett & link: lets do a international chip eating video
Australians: WHERE’RE THE FREAKING SMITHS HUH??
The paprika chips are the basic in Germany 😂😂 don’t you have them in USA?
Expected to see Chase 

Expectations were not met
Was a bit bummed that this wasn’t a dartboard game but Janel was an amazing guest and PLL the Perfectionists is really good 👏🏻
Also MONAAA!!!
The first chips aren’t purple, those are red.

😅
One of the luckiest guests, gots to eat chips and they’re the imported kind
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE A WHERE DOES THIS CHIP COME FROM AND THROW  DARTS
Link: “You trying to get me to go down under again?”

Rhett: “We’ll talk later.”

Good stuff 😂
EMMENTAL CHEESE IS FROM SWITZERLAND
Salt and vinegar is the best
Paprika flavour Walkers max crisps are AMAZING, they need to get some of those to see how good paprika crisps can be!!
me: sees title
me:*singing loudly* WHERE IN THE WORLD-oh
IM SO UPSET. International food dart board are my favorite episodes
Any international🇭🇷 experiments 🧪 we need Chase and the dart board 🎯
link :"tryin to get me to go down under again "
rhett " haha, down under, we'll talk later" 
😂😂
Dude ketchup chips are like my favourite ones
I was disappointed that they didn't play with the darts for this one. ☹
Next time, I can recommend All Dressed flavoured chips from Canada. 😁🇨🇦
This chip stache is giving me “Cotton Candy Randy” evil twin vibes. “Potato Chip Flip” if you will.
as someone who has lived in canada all my life (25) and been east and west ive never heard a Canadian like ketchup chip.
Link is the definition of thirdwheeling in this episode.
Corey Feldman is a Turd.
wow Janel Parrish is maybe one of the few of the actresses that have come to the show that looks actually genuine.
I got a crisps advert watching this! 🤣
Link pronouncing Pakistan without an accent soothes my heart.
99% of the comments: where are the darts?
Me: Is nobody going to talk about Link's furious attempt to pop the bag of chips?
yoooo Janel was my favorite bratz im crying
The chips look more like flower petals. You're eating flowers mister.
So like are we gonna ignore the fact that she waited for Rhett to pick his answer before she made hers...
5:29 my brain: oow nice innuendo right there
Me picturing the scene
Me to my brain: NO STOP IT!!
i wanted to sing "where in the  world do these international potato chips come from" with your intro
Hearing chips instead of crisps bothers me for some reason 😂
You should've included Chitato chips from Indonesia. It's awesome.
0:49 Also known as, IWTAITWWLTLCLTNASOGSNH
Link became the Pringle man
What happened to "WHERE IN THE WORLD DO THESE INTERNATIONAL CHIPS COME FROM"?
Paprika is ALL over Switzerland!
Why are they talking like there’s people behind there camera 🤔🤷‍♂️
Oh I really wanted them to try the habanero lays from Mexico, they’re really good but also crazy spicy 🔥I love them
You have to try something from tosty from Costa Rica
WELCOME BACK TO GMM
-Where the lines are made up and the points don't matter"
:55 Her face when he said Orient 2x. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😉😅
Paprika chips are popular not only in Germany
As soon as i saw link put on the mustache I instantly thought Dr. Robotnik lol
Janel was such a pleasant guest. It's refreshing to see down to earth celebrities.
Why are there no darts?! WE WANT DARTS AND CHASE AND A MAP!
We have limited edition tomato sauce chips here in Australia
I don't think anybody said anything about link hearing Magic masala and he said magic massage 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody:
Link: Thigh-land! That’s how my dad pronounces it.
Now we want chips. 
Anyone else craving chips?
The fact that it took Link 7 tries to pop the bag WAS EPIC HILARIOUS 🤣😂💀💀🤣😂
Damn...I haven’t watched you guys in years 💕 Missed you guys! Glad I’m back
Me: Link you had better eat that chip!
*throws it away
Me: Nooooooooooooo 😖
The obvious lack of a map board, darts, and Chase the cartographer.
Let's talk about that...
I just watched a 14 minutes and 41 seconds of Link not agreeing with Rhett and Janel 😂
Gettin payed and eatin chips
What a great job
As a Canadian I didn’t know that the ketchup chips are solely Canadian 😮
Paprika chips are my favorite! Sadly they dont really have any in sweden so i have to go to norway to get them :(
Love how Janel wasn't awkward at all, one of the guests I enjoy on the show!
Those paprika chips from Germany are my favorite, so if you have leftovers I'll take them please
I am Canadian and the best ketchup chips are Dorito Ketchup chips.  They are much better and I would definitely recommend!  Lots of love from Canada!!!
slanty are the best chips. PERIODT.
I was literally expecting the dart board so much
Link: "You trying to get me to go down under again?"
Rhett: "We'll talk later..."
No wonder they are such good friends.
Ah man, i’d like to try some ketchup chips. 😔😔
NO DART BOARD?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 

WHAT AM I EVEN SUBSCRIBED FOR
honestly thought the paprika chips would be from Hungary instead
Rhett: “these taste like lotion”

Also Rhett: keeps eating more
"Wow, look at the flavor"
 
"Don't you taste the nostalgia?"
 
--Rhett 2019
I'm from Canada and grew up eating ketchup chips I was so innocent thinking all countries had them
Gosh I looooove paprika chips, I grew up with them for my whole life 😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I love you guys included Pakistan! :')
I been watching these guy’s since 6/7 years damn
Aw, I was hoping they'd have a 3-person darts battle!
Man I know it's all good and fun but sometimes I feel bad for Link lol
DARTS DARTA DARTS!!!! Missed opportunity GMM team!!! Great episode nonetheless
the episodes with guests are the ones i skip
In Germany ketchup chips are casual chips
We need a spinoff epsiode where Link opens tough bags from various products.
Link struggling to pop the chip bag is a mood
Link trying to pop the bag of chips made me so anxious cause he's crushing the chips!
"New Schweinstein Castle" XD ^^ :-D
Janel is now probably one of my favorite guests to go on this show because like she wasn't awkward or trying really hard to be funny
I totally expected this to be another dart international test
I'm from Pakistan
England has the most and best crisps in the world.
We have ketchup chips in Belgium too 
Emmentaler isn’t a popular flavour here also it is a new flavour 
Paprika is one of the most popular flavours in Belgium
"That's one of the best things that Canadians have offered us Americans" my guy we literally gave you insulin
“It sneaks up on you” JUST LIKE INDIANS
Australia, were the weirdos who like tomato sauce chips for sure 😂😂😂
ok Im really disapointed you went with ketchup for canada. 
ketchup is actually also a popular UK flavor, All dressed though, is the most canadian.
Try more Pakistani stuff..! 🖤🙏
Link: I'm going into lick daddy mode
Me: Don't be like that in front of...
Janel: Do it
Me:... Well.
Ketchup is my favorite chip!!!
WHERE ARE THE DARTTTTTSSSSSS 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
>not getting Burger Rings from AU/NZ
THEYRE BURGER FLAVOURED MY DUDESSSS
i audibly gasped when I saw Janel!
As amusing as this was, this game would be vastly improved by the FART.
In germany, paprika is probably the most basic flavor for all kinds of snacks
Salt & Viniger I love tangy zip taste
Gotta love her so much. She’s a legendary liar😏❤️
Should have done Mac and cheese flavoured chips from Australia
No disrespect to ketchup and imma letchu finish, but all dressed ruffles is the greatest Canadian chip OF ALL TIME
If Mexico was one of the chips - the flavor would have tp be Adobadas which translates to Marinated.

Imagine the Canadian Ketchup Chip with Chili & Lime added to the Tomato flavoring.  So Link was partly right.

The flavor is a Tomato, Chili, Lime combo, and is the most prominent/common of unique Mexican Chips flavors.

Actually, either through coinidence or knowlege (you never know with Link); Mexico's flavor is a type of tomato-based chip.
Janel was not about Linc. 😂
Can I just say how much I appreciate you guys pronouncing "Pakistan" correctly? Thank you! #itsthelittlethings
My favorites are the Canadian flavor of ruffles called All Dressed
The title of the game was so disappointing. I wanted "Were in the the world do these international chips come from?" Not this :(

Also, no darts!?!? BLASPHEMY!!!
You should have done all dressed chips from Canada!
7:07
i know how good they taste
I like how link recognizes the ketchup chip like he was told to say about red tomatoes from him being hypnotized.
Yes dart would have been better... definitely a personal favorite
I wish the crew would just troll them with 

Lays : Salt Flavor

And just say. "They're from the sea"
One day, you guys are going to have that cover up the guest intro... And nobody will be behind you
Links WOW moment 🤣
The chip moustache.....anybody else see The Lorax 😂😂
BLASPHEMY! This is NOT the right game, lol!😂
Where in the world do these international potato chips come from?
Ah, there it is.😂
The Germany chips I eat them all the time I was hoping you would guess it right but you didn’t that ok
When link said tales I immediately thought of cotton candy randy
Nueschwanstein!!! :D I love that bridge view! It's insane ♡
no mona comments rly? 😂 Oh well GO JANEL
"That's one of the best things Canadians have offered us!"
😂😂 what about Jen!?!
The dart game would have been good with 3 people? 

I'm eating flaming hot lays right now.
Close your eyes at.
5:30
Janel reminds me of Azzy from Azzyland. 😂
You should‘ve eaten Zweifel Chips from Switzerland. I was so disappointed when I saw the flag and they didn‘t get to enjoy our amazing chips!
If only someone send them the Maicih chips from Indonesia , now that's hot . That's hot 😂
Belgium got noticed ㅠㅡㅠ 🙏🙏🙌
I’ve been watching this show for literally 7 years 😂
Link always tries to justify his incorrect answer.
* Warning * 


Link likes stuff in this video
Ketchup chips are also fairly common in Florida. C
This made me crave chips🤣🤣
yeo... i screamed when i realized it was Janel
"Rhett: There was a point where we were right together too 8:27 "
" Link: Queues the look"
Love the Pringle-stache 😄👍
Janel has to b the best guest yet! I love her
I love lays ketchup
Link is one of the most endearing humans 💖
she was a really good guest!
I am literally from Belgium and have never seen those Pringles. Where did thet get that?!
Rhett never said he didn't like Cherry Blossom milk flavored chips
You should try Philippino cheese flavoured chips
Janel was such a sweet guest :) I do love it when R and L pretend to fight for their guest's attention.
Link: “I’m going into lick daddy mode”

Janet: “Do it” 
😂😂😂
“Doesnt have taste only flavor”
Canada is the best and ketchup chips are amazing
MY GOD. KOLSON SLANTY is what literally every single kid in Pakistan grew up eating
Janel was a great guest. She didn't even seem like a guest, if that makes sense. It's like she's always been there.
But there's Chio chips whit paprika in Bulgaria too
that pakistan vs india though 🤣
Ok but the darts 💔💔
They should do something with molly Burke
6:05 awww Link, get's jealous, like always when there's a guest that goes mutually with Rhett. LMAO
JANEL PARRISH!!! she’s so amazing I’m so glad they got her on the show 😁
can I just say I love that neither Rhett nor Link say "pack-is-tan" also yessss Slanty the original nostalgia for Pakistani Americans - but y'all could've used Slims, top pops, kurkure, or chillz too
That's one way to say that castles name.... Not the right way but whatever
Has that lady had an allergic reaction to the food?
1:10 NO! You should have used the Mapboard ™️ with 3 people, carnage like that is quality entertainment.
2:33 Yeah Rhett, just completely dump on Jen why dontcha?
"I'm going into LiCk DaDdY mode"


                     -Link 2019
Hold on,ketchup chips are a Canadian thing? They’re pretty standard where I live.
as an eastern european, this is maybe the first time they eat something I've had in my life (those chio chips with paprika have been on every single party i've been since kindergarten)
darts: my feelings are HURT more than when rhett and link stab me into a board!!!!!
8:56 - 8:58 someone please meme Link!😂😂
Ketchup chips all day 🇨🇦
9:53 it tastes like.............human




I know he's not saying Human. To me it sounded like it on the first listen though lmao
Belgium! 😍
all dressed chips were the best chips canadia gave us
I live in canada and I thought the whole world had ketchup chips lol there so good
“Gather around my chip-stash”
Paprika Chips are popular in whole Europe not just Germany ....
The way link says Thigh land
shoulda done this as a dart episode, janel could have participated
What a great guest! Loved this one, I love her interactions.
Link pronounced México correctly
"I don't know if I like it but I do keep eating it."

Story of my life...
I am from India and I love my chips
Janel is very clearly either 1) into Rhett; or 2) repulsed by Link
Sometimes Rhett just has a better connection with the guesta...
Spicy ketchup was the best flavor of lays to ever be made
Janel was a great guest. Very friendly.
“Look at the flavour, taste the nostalgia”
To all the chips I loved before
Yes!!!! Salt and Vinegar Squad!!!
keep bringing the liars 😍😍
Janel is very beautiful ♥️♥️♥️
I love how Rhett loves his husband Link its beautiful
Got so excited when I saw her appear lmao
cripes the flavors wiz by so fast have to keep rewinding the video.   chill people!
When I see no darts:

Mr. Stark, I don’t feel so good
8:50 iM gOnNa ceLiBatE!¡!
Belgium! Represent!
She taking the game so seriously lookat her face 😂
Salt and vinegar chips are the best!!
I'm honestly always so confused when people don't know about paprika chips since it's a standard chip flavouring here (Belgium). If there's only two flavours available of a chip, it'll be 1. Salt and 2. Paprika.
I LOVE JANEL SO MUCH
Please no more guest on "International taste test"
The US doesnt have ketchup flavoured chips????
Kethcap is my favorite what is yours?
Where is the board and darts?
It's like having a "will it" where they don't test if things "will"...
@8:47 Even when Link wins he never quite wins lol
Those chio paprika chips are absolutely delicious
Mexico "down under"??? They're geographically closer to Mexico City than they are to Washington DC!
Why didn't it do the normal international taste test intro? "Where in the world do these international chips come from?" That was like, my favorite intro.
Y'all never had ketchup chips???
Indian Lays packaging is the toughest to break compared to most others 😂
Mans couldn't pop a cherry 😂
Everyone’s right where are the darts?!
But slanty's jalapeno flavor is way better than vegetable one...
this video reminded me that i need a compilation of link saying he likes folded chips, and one of link saying “thigh”land/“thigh” food
Link at 8:39 "Magic massage :O!!" jajajaja
My name is Janelle!!!!😱
Make a part 2! But then with darts. Also get the "patatje joppie" lays chips from the netherlands, they are amazing and will never guess it.
Mona is that you 😱
Of course Canada bad ketchup lays 😭😭😭
Does America not have paprika!?
We have ketchup crisps in the UK too but I think for us the signature one is Worcester Sauce crisps
us mythical beasts obviously don’t like change.
Slanty are so good 🤤🤤
Wait what ??? You don't have Paprika chips in the US ? :O I'm shocked
Should have been throwing darts
I feel bad because I've never bothered to learn Janelle's name. I always just call her Mona.
Although they're older than me after binge watching these shows I feel like I've literally watched them grow up 😂😂😂
Is That Moana From 13 Reasons Why?
I literally watch them every morning for 1and a half years now
janels hair 😍
I didn’t know that link was chip CPR certified!!
Watching this while fasting probably not such a good idea... Re-programming my diet schedule...................
I've has the cherry chips before in Taiwan and I could not for the life of me finish it.
She vibes really well with Rhett and Link 👏 I expected the darts when I saw the title, but this is still entertaining nonetheless. Now I want some chips...
I don't usually like guests (they tend to be stuck up their own arse), but I thought Janel was a delight, it seems to be such a relaxed episode 😊
Janel is Barbie
OMG OMG OMG ITS MOANA
When I went to Canada I saw the ketchup chips in a store
Great video but doesn’t feel right without the darts!
I love her. She has such a good vibe
Are you guys going to do a season 3 of Buddy System? because Season 1 and 2 were so good there has to be a season 3
Paprika chips are definetly not german. Paprika chips are like the most eaten chips in the netherlands. Probably whole of europe has paprika chips. It's just European.
u shoulda said "lets TACO bout that"
I love how Rhett just kept eating the Indian one.
Awww, I was expecting darts.

Link, hope you're still trusted with those, lol!
she can ducdkbill me anytime
As a Chinese…I came because the cover
As a Canadian I say the best chip we have to offer is All Dressed. Y’all need to try it.
Paprika is pepper in german so they are pepper flavored chips and v good
All Dressed Chips are the true unique Canadian chip. so much better.
She just kept on talking and facing to Rhett 😂
LICK DADDY MODE 😂 LMFAO.
How this episode was: gets it wrong and moves on to the next round 

How this episode should have been: gets it wrong but was 27 cm away 

Darts make things more interesting and exciting
I love this episode I love Janel Parish and my favorite tv show is Pretty little liars and I live the spin of of it. I also like when you brought Shay Mitchel on to the show.
I'm bummed it wasn't a dart game, but I love how pleasant this was. I'm always into the chill games w/ guests who look like they're having a fun time!
can everybody quit talking about murica all crazy PLEASE! 

Most of your countries would be living like north korea if it wasnt for us
I’m so sad, no “WHERE IN THD WORLD DO THERE INTERNATIONAL CHIPS COME FROM!”
How dare u not use da Dart board
She was the perfect guest lol 😂
That was a great episode! Chips are my second favorite food (pizza comes first) so it was really interesting to see the different flavors from around the world! I love Janel, too, she's so sweet and happy. Three cheers for Janel, Rhett and Link, and international chips! :)
First Shay now Janel :D
Aw I was soo excited to watch this after work thinking it was where in the world do these international chips come from :( hope you do more soon
Everything is paprika in Germany
Cherry Blossom is not the same as cherry 😋
12:07 made me laugh. "They don't eat lotion in Switzerland." Ah yes because there are countries where people do eat lotion Rhett.
Paprika Chips are my all time favorite flavor I wish they had them in America
Swedish "Lantchips" is the best chips in the world!!!
Honoured that Pakistan was mentioned.
I disappointed this didn't involve darts. It's okay to use darts with guests!!
OLD 👏 DUTCH 👏 KETCHUP 👏 CHIPS 👏 ARE 👏 BETTER 👏 THEN 👏 LAYS👏 
Thank you
Can we just talk about the fact that almost ever video they make is always on the trending page? Keep going guys your doing so well :)
Like srsly?????
Link was low key jealous
Wtf you guys dont have paprika flavoured chips in the US? That's like the most common flavour in Europe
Have u thought about making your vids in 4k?
As a Canadian, it was very entertaining seeing them taste the ketchup chips.
Obligatory comment about darts and boards.
I liked before I saw there was no dart board lol
Salt and vinegar for the win!!
I thought this would be a dart episode. :(
Janel was going to take Rhett away from Link, he is so jealous lol
Wish we had these International chips available in the USA 😪
Nostril alert on girl 11:50 something in there
Am I blind or is there NO DART BOARD is this international food taste test
HICKORY STICKS
daamn i thought it was gonna be the dart game :/
It's Ramadan.... I'm fasting.... This video........ 
help
What about England’s cheese and onion crisps
Ketchup chips are the best
I'm Canadian and I absolutely despise ketchup chips.
I'm from Belgium and I've never seen those emmental pringles. Must've missed it I guess....And as far as i know, paprika chips are everywhere in Europe...
Ketchup chips have been around for ever
Days ago my brother dip a cherry in milk and I called it cherry milk
why Link is always extra weird when women are around
8:56

Not even gonna comment
When Link said he didn't love the ketchup one, I immediately was like "TOMATO"
Link was almost right on the ketchup chips, we have them in Mexico but they are marketed as "adobadas". They taste virtually the same.
Why aren’t we talking about the fact that they photoshopped a chip
FYI: Cañada is a community college in the San Francisco Bay Area
I loveeee ketchup chips ❤
not even patatje joppie chips from the netherlands, dissapointed
Can you have Shawn mendes on the show?
go get ´em linkster!


aaayyyyyyyyyyyy!!
I didn't even care that it wasn't a dart video (even tho I love them) because JANEL PARRISH IS IN IT I LOVE HER SO MUCH
Magic masala was so hot for you... That's pretty normal for Indians ...
Love my country 
Jai Hind🇮🇳
chip stache op must bring back.
indian lays magic masala are the best
Try international breakfast cereal! But with the darts!
Did Rhett really just say that he thought paprika had no flavor?
I need some chips now
Taste like 1943
Country cards :
Darts : are we a joke to you?
Janel is sooo sweet and so encouraging to Link: she’s seems like a genuine kind person
Link deserves some points because we have had Ketchup Chips in Mexico
Rhett: 'I didn't think paprika had any taste.... It has a flavour - wait'.
We do have the “ketchup” chips in mexico tho... they’re called “adobadas”
My favorite chip flavor is Eric Estrada.
For a second I though she was Carly from Icarly
yeah i'm sad about chase and the darts but SHE'S SOOO BEAUTIFUL !!
#34 on trending street
Those magic masala(India)ones are one of my favourite chips
On Link's defense Ketchup Lays taste pretty similar to Sabritas Adobadas, which are from Mexico.
Cherry blossom pink milk chips... 🤢🤮
I was watching this while eating a bag of Slanty <3 Loads of love from Pakistan!!!!
Dr. Robotachip
2:33 Poutine Rhett Poutine
It’s Margot from TATBILB!!
Please NO guests in:
International Taste Test
Blind Taste Test
Will It
Janelle falling for Rhett lol
wait.. the first chips were red.. right???
Janel looks like Miranda Cosgrove.
I am so disappointed this wasnt a dart episode. Those are my favorites....
LINK! You can't just shove chips up a lady's sleeves like that!
I know you all heard her stutter 😂😂🤣 6:01
1st chip, Link should’ve let the lady choose first, but then she may have taken his daddy chip!
Janel is so pretty!
When link put the chip ‘stache on at the end and said “well hello!” For some reason Micheal Scott from the office popped into my head
At school i am called chip girl
No darts? Must've just thrown them all at my heart. Those are my favorite episodes!
Now I really want some Pringles.😅
Herr's makes ketchup flavored chips and I love them.
Ketchup and Paprika are in the UK too. Also Masala is around occasionally.

Also "lays" is "walkers" in the uk, just to confuse things.
PAKISTAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
This isnt the dart game im kinda sad
Papryka crisps are polish
Missing DARTS
Best chip from Canada is All Dressed Ruffles not the Ketchup Lays.
MORE GIRLS!! THIS WAS AWESOME
This is the first time I've seen Pakistan be included in a show other than one or two other channels
As a proud Belgian! I would say Bicky Burger Lays would be a more fitting Belgian chips for us! Nonetheless, proud you thought of us :)
1:02 He totally Farted lol.
Uh no I think ALL DRESSED UP ruffles are the best chip they given us
When I Saw My Country In The Picture (Australia) I Literally Thought They Would Have Smiths Chicken Chips. But Nope ...
Dang it guys! I don’t even like chips but I want some now 😂
You're welcome. From Canada
Why did I think that was Miranda casgrove
Paprika crisps (chips) are available all over Europe and they're amazing
Link trying to pop that bag had me in stitches.
WILL IT CHIP??!!
Paprika in Netherlands means Bell Peppers
In the netherlands we almost only eat paprika chips
im from the Netherlands and we eat paprika chips all the time i even ate them today!
Jay's Sour Dill chips all the way
I have tried cherry blossom chips and to me it kind of like ketchup lmao but weird
Flower + milk = lotion
ketchup is my favorite chip!
Link: LOOK AT THE FLAVOR!

Me: Literally me
People not knowing about ketchup chips is so surreal. Don't even get me started on the allmighty "all-dressed".
Paprika has a taste when heated. Which is why it's in certain Hungarian sausages and other European dishes like chicken paprika. It gets spicier with heat and it does have a taste.
Ok, just gotta say. Those paprika chips that they said were from Germany, they are from Romania. In Europe. I have been there twice and those are my favorite things in the earth. So yes the are from Romania, not Germany. Thank you.
No map dart board? :(
do a will it guacamole
Wait pretty little liars is still not finished? :o
I bet Link can't be trusted around guests with darts, that's why there was no dart board lmao
I feel like,🎶🎵🎶 Goin on a trip and we're gonna try some chips🎵🎶🎵 (Little Einsteins). Could have been used.
Shouldn’t the points get progressively lower since it’s easier to guess during the later rounds?
I was really sad when they did not show Rhett's full Wink at like 1:50
paprika chips are heaven on earth
Please redo with the darts😭
Totally missed the opportunity to get All Dressed chips from Canada !
Lick daddy mode......we need to talk later hahahahahha
Rhett and Janel are sleeping together. They are too in sync. Or they could be related. Either or.
Salt and vinegar? Gtfo lol
Salt and vinegar is the best lol
Paprika chips are very big in Switzerland too.
I’m going into lick daddy mode - Link
LMAO 8:56 - 8:58 needs to be a gif!
LINK LOOKS LIKE BRENDON URIE
not too much. Just a bit.
...i only knew that janel parrish was in bratz 🤣🤣
5:30 to 5:32 Link: I am going in to lick daddy mode
Janel Do It
I feel like the reason they didn’t do the dart board was because Rhett constantly wins over Link
nice Pringle mustache Link!!  was expecting to see Cartographer Chase, but
sadly he was not here 😒  LOL.
where. in the world. did the international dart board go? 




(sing in tune to Carmen San Diego)
I'm eating cereal and its 8:18 pm in Melbourne.
this is links fault
Her hair is glorious
THe chips stache just made me wheeze
i’m glad they know how to properly pronounce pakistan LOL
Are paprika chips rare in the us? In Poland paprika and ketchup chips are very common
wait...paprika is not a international flavour? here when you say chips, paprika IS the standard. really interesting =)
The chip stash wouldnt look good on anyone else other than link
Most beautiful chip eater
loved this! ketchup chips look gross!
I found your old video where in the weezer video
my 2 yo loved your show he always says "hot chicken!!" when your intro comes on 😂😂🔥
For anyone know janel Parrish  from PLL
She's tiny compared to them, adorable❤
Gentleman, you should do a guest review over here on In The Chips. For real
Slanty is life
Link:"You guys are always wrong together. I'm cool with that."
Rhett:"There was a point when we were right together too".
Do I sense some jealousy there Link?😉
we have ketchup chips in the US.. am i the only one who has seen them here?😂 for like.. years.
Round one chips looks exactly like the hot ones
Love Janel! 10/10 !
Rhett and Janel 💪
Eating Pringles while watching a video about chips 👌
I love pretty little liars the perfectionist
Mona!😍❤️
Old Dutch is better than lays hands down
Janel is so cute 🥰
Donkey Lip it🦙
I don’t, HAHAHAHA
Aight so we got clickbaited
I would like to try the ketchup chips.
She herself a crush on Rhett. 
She leans more towards him.
She looks in his direction more.
Yep.
I’m so glad they showed such diversity with the chips, especially including Slanty’s from Pakistan
FINALLY THEY HAD PAKISTAN AS A CHOICEEEE
did they swap outfits for this? lol
I thought there were ketchup chips in other countries, not only in Canada.
Watching this makes me want a bag of potato chips, of any kind, right now. XDD
I keep forgetting that the rest of the world doesn't have the blessing of ketchup chips 😂
My school is doing a countdown to the last day of school (starting at Z) and Thursday (May 9) was Potato Chip Day (for P)... 🥔
We’ve had the ketchup chips here. I have a friend who is determined to find them somewhere. I guess it’s going to be Canada 😂. I love that y’all are always “trending.” The only you tubers that I like that are constantly trending and I KNOW I’m gonna like. ❤️❤️❤️
im gonna go buy chips and a chip-stash for myself asap
SAAAAAALLLLLLLLLTTTTT ASNNNNNNNNDD VVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIINIGERRRRRRRRR
 I love salt and vinegar
ugh magic masala chips are the best
“I don’t know if I like it, but I do keep eating them” 💀💀💀💀
I love salt n vinegar chips
please,,,bring back the darts and bring the guests away from food videos.
I love ending my day with GMM.
Rhett: when you hit that blunt a little to hard and now you’re seeing flavor
Link gotta exercise them chip popping muscles
NO DARTS!?!
Should of got some vegemite or sausage sizzle chips from Australia
Janel and Rhett seems have their own world about chips and  Link is  out of that world
I'd love to see you guys do an international Fanta taste test, there are some fanta flavors in Romania you might be impressed about!
How are those "PURPLE"?
i wanted this format to be r&l exclusive.... smh
Okay we need her as a guest more often
Dude WTF I started this episode while eating my ketchup chips!
What the.. Paprika chips? Someone should've filled the crew in that there's Currywurst flavoured ones in Germany.
I actually really like those cherry milk chips...
This is like a date .... with a 3rd wheel
“You can see the flavour” SHAPES from Australia anyone?? 🤣
From Canada, All Dressed chips > Ketchup chips
8:57 but without context
JANEL
Lay's isnt a Canadian brand, maybe next time pick a actual Local chip brand. Old Dutch are great.
First time Pakistan was listed an option in GMM
YES JANEL!!!
Paprika = Pepper
India's magic masala :')
Link should’ve gotten half a point for guessing they were ketchup chips, at least.
But here in Mexico we do have the first chips but it's called "adobadas"
gdammit, i was expecting bom ba pa dom ba bom bom, and a dart board!
ily guys wth 😤💞🙌🏽
Rhett's wink @1:52
me:Do others also comment on  trending videos just to get attention
Others:...........
Me: so it's just me then..
        The attention seeking weirdo..
International flavors and no darts wtf!!!
Link knows the guest likes Rhett more
Can confirm, ate lotion last week. Tasted bad
Love these guys! Been watching them since their Maine Man video.
Let's face it, if this had been a dart episode Link wouldn't have won, so I'm all for it 😁😁😁😁
Rhett & Link's Secret 'Stache
I could eat Spicey Sweet Chili Doritos all day.
Now I want ketchup chips
They should have gotten the red slanty chips love them, coming from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ❤️
She is just a dark haired Felicia Day
why do i feel like link is  isolated from the other two
They’re bound to make gifs outta 8:57 😂
As a canadian i am shook that lays ketchup are not known in us
This episode represents my whole love life. I'm Link and every girl I meet is more interested in my friend.
iCarly
She said ghost pepper ....then I live in India do I eat ghost pepper everyday
seriously who else thought this was darts i am deeply saddened D;
Funny how they didn’t need to clickbate us
YAS GIRL! SALT AND VINEGAR IS BY FAR THE BEST FLAVOR OF CHIP!
Ketchup is a Canadian chip??
I think 3 person dart game would be a neat twist, that’s what I was expecting
That moment when you realise that indian and pakistani cuisine are essentially identical in terms of flavors.....
Dart Board>Whoever this chick is
Don't know who she is but she had really good chemistry with them
Sad y'all didn't do the map this time
Dude I hope he was in the right chair
Do international booze taste test
Going international 🌐
Can you try Traditional Icelandic food i want to see your faces🇮🇸
Eating Takis while I watch

4:42 hmmm.. you sure Rhett?
7:07

Ruffle shaped lays.
Indian chips are armour content packaging n spices

I was looking for a “Where in the World” video.
I had a dream that ya'll had Gordon Ramsay on the show, and now it's the only guest I ever want to see on here.
We ALSO gave our best Americans Maple Syrup and Hockey. But yes, the Ketchup chips are the best chips in Canada
I've been clickbaited I thought the sakura lays is actually pink

British person has left the chat
Aww man, it should have been a dart game.
Rhett was right on the belgium one because we have those in Germany too. And Germany has the craziest chils flavors even tho Paprika is Like the standard here we have Currywurst Chips or Stadion Bratwurst with mustard
🇪🇬 Egyptian chips are the best 🇪🇬 Chipsy for the win! Kebab and the Spicy ones are the best. Wish they would have tried Middle Eastern chips
RHETT THERES NO SUCH THING AS "TOO CHEESY" FOR WISCONSIN
Mexico has chips very similar to ketchup chips there called adobado so I think he should get the point
as a german: paprika chips are  so ordinary here, i really didn't know it wasn't as well known in the rest of the world
Its Cotton Candy Randy's cousin!!!
do ketchup clays taste similar to adobadas sabritas(mexican name for lays)??
Rhett thinking paprika doesn't have any flavour bothers me, you're too old to not know.
Wait, they don't have ketchup chips in the US?! By the way ketchup chips are not only in Canada.
YAS 🙌🙌🙌 LOVED the episode ❤️💛💚 and Rhett looks great in a jean jacket!!! I like links shirt too 😂
You Guys Rock!!
Holy glory hole beta face.
Thigh-land😂😂😂
There are corn chips in Korea, and they are really good
the german paprika chips are indeed very very good! but if you get the chance, try Chipsfrisch ungarisch (also a paprika flavor)
For what it's worth, I'd prefer guests not be on the really good shows like this one. You had to change the entire game to make it work. Meh. Good guest regardless.
i missed the ba ba ba ba ba ba baa, where in the world do these international chips come from
I wanted darts :((
They shoulda used the dart board :(
OMG i love salt and vinegar, and everyone always looks at me like im crazy!!!
Idek how I got here but i love it
And here we are in India, eating those chips like it was literally made of nothing but salt and pepper
Chio is a Hungarian brand though...
I would have thought the cherry blossom will be Japanese
Is there anybody not upset that this wasn't a dart episode?
Wait... there's not ketchup flavored chips in the US? Really ?
I am a bit salty that they didnt use the chilli  flavour of slanty.
Wow I love her
YES! They started with ketchup chips. Those are the actual best chips I’ve ever had
What??? I was all excited for Link throwing darts and Chase hiding behind Rhett so that he doesn't get hit...
Why do we (UK) call them "Walkers" but everywhere else its "Lays"?
Lol chipstache at the end
Ketchup chips are bomb. But they got the wrong brand, Old Dutch ones are way better than Lays
Rhett with the ultimate FART and not making Link throw darts. Nice guy Rhett.
as an introvert i am amazed at how smoothly Janel interacted with Rhett and Link no awkwardness at all
This could have been one of their throw dart games
who else thought that the chip stache was a chip STASH as in a storage of chips lmaoa
But where are the darts?!? 😩😒
Theatrical Irony is watching them talk about the flavors KNOWING THEY'RE WRONG
LETS GO SLANTY'SSSSSS
❤️ chips
Slightly sad it wasnt darts
I want to try it. :(
Janel was a really great guest! 😂👍
Guests are great! But please go back to the darts for international taste tests!!! Those episodes are so awesome!!
In my country is sour cream and onion flavour very popular and also sweet paprika or bacon
why would you get ketchup lays instead of all dressed ruffles?
Hey, I saw the Lays Ketchup one at Tenerife so it’s not just canada
wait they don’t have ketchup chips over there?
Darn, link won
where the darts at... plus chase - almost always getting hit by link
WHERE IS THE "WHERE IN THE WORLD DOES THIS INTERNATIONAL CHIP COOOOME FROM?" T.T
they said Pakistan the right way. Rhett said it the right way
gal cheated with the chio chip, no guest next time, bring the darts back.
Janel ! 😍
Sasha next !!
That girl was really into Rhett
wtheck, no darts?
Also known as the time Link lost a fight against a bag of Indian chips.
They are both super cute and quite handsome in their own seperate ways. I love ALL of their facial expressions, personalities, soothing voices, humors and how down to earth they seem. (Yes, including the beautiful young lady in the middle!) 😊
fun fact about chio: every german person that watches the nfl knows them cause they are their main sponsor here
Why is she always looking at rett😂
We have ketchup chips in the US 👌
Screw the dartboard, I clicked for the pink chip so I’m disappointed too
She definitely gravitated more towards Rhett lol (she = the guest)
Are ketchup chips really only in Canada? Coulda fooled me lol I grew up with those
Will It hat?
Link is a demon
What the funk...yooo cherry milk chips...it's either awesome or horrid. 😨
Why isn't anyone talking about cherry blossom milk flavored chips?
Nobody interested?
What!? Americans don't have ketchup chips!?
They should have used the dart board!
Why not a dart 😩😩😩
Mona!!!
I love chips!
Just realized Rhett looks like a young Ron Swanson
Guessing the nation is a little weird with products that deliberately try to have the vibes of other culturesp
We do have the emmentaler cheese pringles in germany!
You didn't use the dart board to give link a chance, right?
We also have Ketchup chips in Germany only that there are shaped like bears  ... so 60% better already !
Rhet raging about his chair if you whatch that give a like
Rhett & Janel chose the answers for the ones still to come quite often lol 😄😄😄
I saw a picture of "Potato chips panties flavored from Japan"

I'm not sure if it's real or not (I hope not lol)
Those ketchup chips are $15 a bag on Amazon. $9.78 for the snack, $5 for shipping. $14.78 for a 9.5 ounce (or 270g) bag... that's way too much. I can get a bag of chips I know taste good for $4 at my local grocer, and I can eat intact chips the moment I get home, instead of waiting three weeks and quite possibly having all the chips pulverized into powder during shipping.
Ashley benson next
I live ketchup chips but if you ever eat them please, make sure you have no cuts on your lips. It hurts.
5:55 what the heck😂
:/ wat. Where is the dart board? Ugh. It would've been fine with the guest.
Where are the darts! 😱
Ketchup chips are a hid staple
Wait so they dont have Ketchup chips in the US!?
hold on. Americans don't have Paprika chips???
It is indeed a poppable bag😂 I do that a lot.
i've had the ketchup ones, i like them.
bruh I thought this was darts.
How about we return to when Link and Rhett wrote their stuff...??? 😭😭😭
you didn't have the best ones, Lay's Wild Mushroom and Sour Cream
thought there was gonna be more darts and wasn't. Guess Janel dodged a bullet. Wait, no, a dart. :)
I like you should DO MORE DARTS, like if you do to!  ( sorry Chase )
Best guest ever. Honestly the only one I've ever liked
I can’t be the only one that doesn’t really care for guest episodes am I????!! 🤨
And yet I watch it at night
Anyone else watching this while eating breakfast?
NO MORE Guests!
I love you Mona
We have all of these in England
Theres ketchup chips in Turkey to but its not called "traditional"
Why not darts
Cant imagine her as anything other than A 😂
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DART BOARD?!?!?!?!?!?
So we're going on the taste test route, aren't we?
no Lay's " patatje Joppie" from the Netherlands?  dissapointed..... 😭
This would've been better with darts not flags
owww.. i was waiting the pink chip! :(
wow. Mona is THRiving
no darts?!
Okay, I knew link had low tolerance but having the magic masala make him react like that made me loose me it
You need to try the dutch joppie saus chips from the netherlands!
I love slantys
You guys dont have Ketchup chips in America??!?
Next Halloween, I’m wearing a chip stache and a chip beard so I can be the chip historian. Thank you for the inspiration, Link.
Where’s the darts did we have to take them away from link
Get Paul Rudd and/or Tom Holland on the show please
they should do ginger in between 9:40
When I saw the Canadian ketchup chips, for some reason I thought of this being the go to snack for Colonel Mustard if he had a bad break up.
Janel is so sweet
(」ﾟﾛﾟ)｣ GOOD MYTHICAL MORNING
Idk why i feel like the girl in the middle doesnt like the guy at the right
I can't believe I just wasted 6 minutes and 30 seconds of my life watching almost half of this.
Should have been darts
I like her! I had hoped they would use the dart board though lol
had no idea who she is but she seems sweet
y’all should do a week old taco bell taste test!
Has Wilford Warfstache met his match with the Chip Stache?
No more guests, please
INDIA :)
Does anyone remember the Lays Guacamole potato chips from like 10 years ago?  Those were the best chips ever!
She so cute 😍😍
please make the icons bigger. i can not read the flavor.
I no likey guests. Me prefer just Link and Rhett with da crew
Link, honey. Let’s not wear that shirt again. Love you guys.
Picks up India and Pakistan 🇮🇳🇵🇰
🇩🇪Germany: am I joke to you?
I'm from Belgium and I've never heard of Pringles Emental chips :'))) I'm a fake Belgian ig :')))
Um... I was hoping to see Link FART in this episode.
Why no Aussie chips
No dart board? Mannn.
I always forget that the US dont have ketchup chips
She's straight crushing on Rhett
Glad I see alot of people that agree how was this not a 3 way ..where in the world.. episode still a good ep and all but the where in the world is always fun to watch
There's a whole world of really weird flavors
In holland its very normal to eat paprika chips
Its mind boggling to me that americans dont have Paprika flavoured chips
Bruh why they actin so professional
Where’s the Australian chicken flavor chips
Is it just me that thinks she’s flirty
#chipslover
This week's guest was not bad at all.
PAPRIKA CHIPS!!! I tasted these in Germany for the first time last summer and I'm so glad other people think they just taste like barbeque.
Try zevia 's soda
We know who is her favorite lol
Damn , i was hoping it would be a dart throwing game episode:(
It's not an international taste test without the darts
I have to say I love your videos.
If it flops LIFT IT
Who is fasting
We have ketchup chips in Michigan too
Dart board.... bye
wtf is wrong with those ketchup chips, they are so red o.O Here in Belgium wa have them also and from lays, but they are normal colored here
Whait, what? You dont have Paprika Chips in America?
It's literally our "plain" flavour.
I think Janel might have a crush on Rhett. Lol 😈
Should have been the dart game :(
I like the video will it chip
Link looks like the lorax with the mustache haha
Oh man, I was waiting for salry liquorice chips from Finland

Oh wait...

I forgot Finland doesn't exist 😂😂
and here i am eating regular lays chip
She is so 😍
You have to try hojuelitas
WHERE ARE THE IRISH "TAYTOS"?!
This guest was great! It's nice when guests are down for the game they are playing
in chile we have ketchup and barbeque
here in spain we have chips that taste like fried eggs and the flavour is so SPOT ON it is scary
wait what??? American's don't have ketchup chips??? They are very popular in Europe tho.
Choo Choo...
If you think ketchup chips are good you have to try All Dressed chips (bbq, ketchup, and salt and vinegar combined).
Great video guys keep up the great videos 😊😊
I like how their shirts are the primary colors lol
First person ever who said the name of my country right
Monaaaaaaaaa!
I am unironically eating sea salt & vinegar chips while watching this
I thought it was going to be a stash of bags
Even while eating paprika chips, you wouldn't know they were paprika flavored, but they're amazing.
No dartboard 😢
10:54
Omg I'm Pakistani the slantys are everywhere and there are spicer versions XD
her extensions
EATS A CHEETO CrUNch
Yall need to get Tom Ellis or Jeffrey Dean Morgan on the show. Tom ellis needs to be on a Halloween episode in the future for sure
Y’all should try bratwurst flavoured chips from Germany - idk how common they are but my roommate and I ate bags and bags of them when we were in Berlin last summer
You should’ve had blueberry oat chips from Finland!!!
Oh have her back! She's sweet.
I wonder what the cherry milk taste like
Chips.
As soon as she said salt n vinegar, I wanted to put a ring on it
I can taste that last chip by the description of suntan lotion!
I live in Canada
I literally have no idea who that girl is and I’ve never seen this woman in my life
The chip wasn't pink.
I just had the weirdest dream and you two were in a good chunk of it. Um Rhett are you a painter?
Please don't use that point system in future, it undermines first half of the entire game. All answers in a game should be worth same as each other in my opinion for the purpose of fairness.
This is usually one of my favorite episodes, but I really missed the map and darts! I’m disappointed that you guys wasted an international food.
Is it me or does every female guest they bring on seem kinda flirty with Rhett and Link is always like the third party?
I was hoping they would do “prawn cocktail” crisps from England. (They are my favorite!! But I can barely find them in Australia)
I usually don't like guests but I like her :)
Who’re my Salt and Vinegar fans?
8:56 dat face
The rest of the world doesn't have ketchup chips?! They are red guys.....like...ketchup... Purple?! 🤷
9:14 i use to eat those! But my friend was bringing it not me 😂
Lays Patatje Joppie is also a very special flavour.
Im from Belgium but have never seen those Emmenthal chips in my store. 
U had to get Pickles from Lays..
Mona ? Is that you ? Lol
2:32 Damn straight Rhett!
"See the flavor, taste the nostalgia." Chio. "For when you wanna look like you're eating really awesome chips." Rhett should start making commercials. Lmao
BELGIUM!
Y’all baited us
pretty sure Paprika is from Hungary not Germany
Am I the only one who thinks gmm seems like it has a toxic workplace?
Lick daddy mode
I would say European countries prefer the ketchup crisps over Canada. Trust me, I see them everywhere when I go to European countries. Was very surprised to see them in Bulgaria
Is that Mona from PLL
7:55 wooow
Nope Nope ,, Darts were expected
Yeah yeah, the dart thing, me too.
But she is just an absolute delight of a guest!
No darts?😟
The ketchup chips weren't purple??? Um???
I think you guys should do a little Debbie vs. Hostess vs. Tastykakes. do a blind test to see if you can distinguish the difference between identical products, and to determine which is better
no darts?
I would probably love the sakura chips. My family always says I enjoy hairspray flavors.
TRENDING!
where’s the dart board:(
Oh come on. That masala chip isn’t even spicy. I eat the remaining masala powder at the base of the packet as well.
Is that icarly😂
Gooooood Mythicalll Morrninggggg! Have a great mythical day🔥💕
7:42 channelling owen wilson haha
All Dressed > Ketchup 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
So funny watching Link be awkward 😂😂
No darts?! >:(
13:38 some have forgotten that Link is the true Pringle’s mustache guy...

But not us...

Not Us!
SHES SO PRETTY 😔
Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom  Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom!!
It makes sense to have ketchup chips, we put ketchup on our French fries!
Go back, count how many times Janel chose the wrong answer and got it right but for the round after she chose India and the chip after was India
I once had pepperoni pizza flavored chips. They were AMAZING!!!!
I swear there used to be Chuck e cheese ketchup chips
More dart board episodes!
Rest assured there is a lot more that Canada can offer you, Rhett McLaughlin.
Uh.. Jade??
Hey,  I'm from Pakistan and slantys are one of the best chips here.......according to me though 😂😂😂
I thought it was Aimee Garcia at first-- my vision's getting blurry...
No darts? No Chase?
How did Link get to 4!!
I’m from Belgium and never had emmental chips , I would have said ketchup or paprika or maybe grills but those ones 🤭
I always forget that you guys don't have ketchup chips 😂
Lets talk about how janel parish and miranda cosgrove could play sisters in a movie. THEY LOOK THE SAME
What about the darts???
OKAY MONA.
no no noooooooooooooooooooo not salt and viniger
Next Video Idea

International Corn Chip Taste Test

6:40 STUTEEERRRRR
Wait Americans don't have ketchup chips
Just imagine potato chip flavoured potato chips
I live in Belgium but I've never seen these tho
Could be me.. probably.. :p
I thought Lays Patatje Joppie from the Netherlands would also be included in this episode...):
No barbaque is best
Rhett needs to get a point because those Emmental Pringles ARE available in Germany.
I'm early better make a joke.

Links dart throwing skills
We also have sweet potato
Rhett , belgium is not Germany if you turn it like this !!!! The colors are in wrong order
they need to try "sabritas habaneras"
Me: (*watches the first round*) I actually eat ketchup with regular lays chips... only when eating a meal that includes ketchup though... don’t judge me please...
You guys have to try "lays joppiesaus" from the netherlands
But uh... Salt and vinegar isn't good
why do you never do Australian food
no dartboard? I’m upset now
Anyone else disappointed it didn't involve darts but involved a guest? :(
Good Mythical Morning post notifications are my alarm clock for the weekdays
13:39
They should guess flavours and not countries
I'm form canada
Okay if you use international in the title then put a food after it... EVERYONE IS GETTING THEIR HOPES UP FOR A WHERE IN THE WORLD DO THESE INTERNATIONAL CHIP FLAVORS COME FROM I AM UPSET
🤤🤤🤤🤤
MONA
International instant noodle taste test
I’m Canadian but I like all dressed ruffles chips than ketchup chips
Dart board has left the chat
And it’s taking the darts with it 😤
No dart board
Dissapointment
11:54 booger, sorry I had to do it...
No darts? 😭
I love her and she was cool in the bratz movie!!! ❤️
Who even are the guests they have in their videos...
Crisps
A whole new wooooorld
She looks like iCarly.
Salt & Vinegar.... gross.
This would've been a better guestless "where in the world" game
Link, they don't resort to ketchup in Mexico. That's why salsa is a thing.
Why no darts?
I expected the dartboard, and I was psyched for Chase the cartographer, and I am disappointed.
🤣🤣🤣
WE WANT DART BOARD, WE WANT DART BOARD, WE WANT DART BOARD
OMG can't believe they put my favorite green Slanty here!! Shoutout from Pakistan💕
Don't trust mona, she's so manipulative
9:04 It’s good-
CRISPS
I want you to good  mythical morning me
"It's true, I do like chips."
Next you're going to tell us you like oxygen and water!
little bit awkward how much flirting was going on there
Love it love it love it. Can’t wait to taste them!!!!
janel is such a cute and easy going guess! probably one of my favorite guests and i wouldn’t mind seeing her on the show again!
Hold on! I’m not Canadian I’m Saudi and absolutely surprised that you don’t have ketchup chips in the US ???
I love you guys so, so much and would like to someday take part in a challenge of my own.  Thank you guys for being a part of my daily routine!!!
My favourite chips is potato
You can’t put “international __ taste test” and not use the darts. I was excited until I realized it was flags not darts.. v upset 😭
iCarly.
Wow, a guest that eats the items
How everyone in the crew pronounce Pakistan 

The crew: pAkA stOnnnnn
Do get in there
Who else thought it was a stash, not a stache
Is she wearing shoulder pads????
Wait America doesn’t have ketchup chips?
I’m just chilling up here in Canada eating my ketchup chips
i like bbq!
Pretty little liars is still on
I hope they learn from this
Guess a german send them a care package. First the tea, now the chips. :D
EMMENTAL FROM BELIGIUM?! 
You must be joking 🤬😤😟
It’s A lol
DART GAMEEEE
MY GOD
Ummmm...does anyone one else see her absolutely  CRUSHING  on Rhett? Yikes!
Wow. I think this is my first time actually watching gmm in the morning
Emmental pringles are also in Germany. That's where I first tried them
no one is gonna comment on how abso friken lutely tiny she is compared to them? damn snack sized lmao
The reason why Chase and darts are not present in this episode is because Chase is currently in the hospital from an unfortunate B Roll dart-throwing event.
The indian geography you printed is wrong
Blasphemous! No dart throwing?
The heck is that in the middle?
Darts are better.
try the worlds hottest corn chip
You see how much she likes rett dude she was all over him
Finally something from Pakistan🇵🇰🇵🇰

Ik you guys didn't like it that much but Slantys are great!!
pakistaaaaaaaaan for the first time it has come !!!! finallllllyyyyy yeeeeeeeaaaah
The Chip Colonel is Cotton Candy Randy's disturbed cousin
No wonder link didn't care for the ketchup chips because he doesn't like tomatoes
Where in the world did "where in the world did these international foods come from" go?
Getting pretty sick of the constant collabs.... I watch GMM for you two, not for celebrities I don’t know or care about....
you can absolutely tell she doesn’t duckbill pringles based on her reaction to what happens when you duckbill pringles
YESS THE INDIAN MASALA LAYS ARE THE BEST 
I GET THEM EVERY  WEEK!
man im a chips fanatic i eat chips almost every day have me on the show were u guess the brands and il win like  that girl that did the pizza crust but without cheating ;)
why you dont put any arabic stuff, guys.. :c
There red not purple
WHERES THE DARTSSSSSSSS
No darts :( but I do love Janel Parish
I thought that was Miranda Cosgrove. I never would've known otherwise without the description.
“Are you trying to get me to go down under”. “We’ll talk later” 😂
Absolutely butchered the name of Neuschwanstein Castle.
Ketchup chips... purple? Purple? I think you guys need to have your eyes checked lol XD
My favorite flavour is between Sea Salt & Malt Vinegar or Ketchup.
Where are the darts
8:56😹😹😹😹😹😸😸😺😺😺
😂😂 link getting jealous and being thirsty.
I’m disappointed in the lack of darts in this episode😢
666k views!!😈
One of the best guest ever!
You should do a Mac n cheese taste test
WHERE IN THE WORLD DO THESE INTERNATIONAL CHIPS COME FROM?
should have been a dart episode
i think the word rhett wanted was "color'" when trying to describe a "look" of a flavor lol
#13 on trending street
I was expecting darts
You guys need to try patatje joppie chips from the Netherlands
nooooooo..... we were due for a dart game!
i haven’t watched gmm in a couple years and i’m kinda sad because i miss the old intro
no darts:(
I was hoping for the dart board ... my disappointment and sadness are equally immeasurable
Paprika spice is just ground up 'bell peppers'
International pudding make it happen
Rhett don't do Pakistan dirty like that, the Slanty's spicy flavour is dope af
Irish potato chips are so good, can’t go wrong with Tayto. It’s a good name
Why didnt you guys do a dart game with this i love those episodes...
8:55 That’s gonna be a GIF 😂
Im sad, my favorite type of episodes are the dart throwing 😭
13:30 “And YOU muster be.  THE MONOPOLY GUY...”
666k views...that’s not ok
To much cheese for the american palate, no such thing! It's like butter there's  never to much.
It's exquisite cuisine.
what about will it casserole??
can you not tell us where its from before they guess so we can kinda guess too
no one gets german chip flavors :/
I love her!
No doubt the BEST DUO on youtube
Like if you guys agree .
I've had those ketchup chips in mexico
They're called adobadas
Was totally gipped, where is the dart throwing? 0/10
Seeing international food is super interesting to me and I don’t know why anyone else with me?
No darts! Still love the video, been here since 2015 


comment if you're in 2015 gang
Mexico doesnt make taco flavored things at least not  hard shell taco thats american !
Seeing as they accept most of the brands, I'm surprised they didn't try the purple sweet potato chips... ( / 'o')/
I clicked on this because I thought it would be "where in the world do these international potato chips come from"
My daughter and I love watching your channel.  Thank you for doing such amazing videos guys!
everyone complaining about it not being a dart throwing vid 🤦‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️
Shrimp chips are my favorite
Chiply Chipstachio is born! Now Cotton Candy Randy has a brother!
The lack of darts was upsetting
Salt and vinegar for the WINNNN
7:42 Owen Wilson, is that you?
Whoa Janel Parrish!
I’m sad they didn’t use darts, I always get hype when I see international because it means darts 🙁
Why no darts😥
No Smiths?
its not unpoppable link you just weak lmao
How could u do this without the darts!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why didn't they use the world map and darts?
Where's the darts?
Salt and vinegar are my fiancee's favorite chip too haha.
<SIGH> .... I THOUGHT THIS WAS DARTS😭😭😭! Bummer! Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
MONAAAAA!!!!
I have just learned that paprika is not a common American crisp taste... (I live in Belgium)
Where are the darts? And the charts (c for chips  and arts as in farts or flarts)? Not cool guys,
Emmental Pringles are from Belgium? I'm Belgian and I've never seen those before.
Help! I was looking for a video taste testing store bought pizza sauces, and to my amazement, I can't find any videos about it! Me and my family love these videos and I'd love to see a video of them taste testing pizza sauces.
Chip-stache is Cotton Candy Randy’s Cousin
Hearing ketchup chip makes me proud of my country
He looks like Dr. Robotnik with that stache xD
It would be hard to concentrate with her sitting beside me.
Is unpopable a word???  No, it’s not.
im so disappointed that this wasn't on the dart board
It would be awesome to have someone with an awesome palette to be in one of these like Gordon Ramsey
I really liked this episode! Janel was a great guest!
Thought that was Miranda cosgrove
I did not know that ketchup chips were like a Canadian thing. But i love them lol
Aww I love Janel!  They have the most random people on here though😂
What up with all the pretty little liars guests lol
I always want Link to win. I sit at the edge of my seat all tense waiting for him to win these games.
Belgian here, never seen the Pringles Emmental. Most eaten chips besides salt is (Lays) paprika! 🔥
What. Where’s. The board. Where’s the farts. And darts! So sad.
me: sees video, slowly looks at the boletus chips I was eating
starts searching for hidden cameras
Is she the girl called mona from pretty little liars
I think she has a bugger in her nose
I’m from Detroit and we had ketchup chips! I thought it was normal. We also had pickle chips! Better Made is a great Detroit brand!
Purple ?
I love how serious they always are in their analysis. "It definitely has a bugle consistency."
Didnt know ketchup chips were a Canadian thing lol
Someone gif link at 9:54

Please, I need this in my life
Nobody:..




Link: 
I'm disappointed in the lack of darts
Germany is not Belgium 😡🇩🇪
Chio are popular in poland too. :D had them in the 90s
She’s great! She’s so nice omg
You cant tempt me with an international taste test and not make it a dart game
No dART BOARD!?
Damn it I want chips
Not the same without the board and darts
She was a very gracious guest!!!!
Indian magic masala Lays aren't as spicy as they are reacting. Maybe they aren't familiar with Indian spiciness
13:40 the guy on the left is so sad
It’s Mona, what a surprise!. Janel was great, so sweet.👏🏼❤️
The Emmentaler Pringles are here in Germany as well. Not just in Belgium.
Ketchup chips are soooo good!! I haven’t had them in years though
Every top comment is people complaining about no darts but I enjoyed the episode anyways🤷🏻‍♂️
If something tastes like a taco to a non-Mexican... it’s probably not Mexican
Come onn paprika is from Hungary
WALKERS IS THE ORIGINAL  like if you get it
I like how Rhett had to whisper "now you say what time it is" to Janel. xD
Everytime swiss gets mentioned in a youtube video I get so excited cuz we barely get noticed 😂
finally a decent guest :D
Oh man, wait till you try Doritos Ketchup chips from the Netherlands!!! Those are so delicious!
This should have been the dart board.
JANEL MY FAV
Canada has done a lot of good things for Merrrica...
MONA 💜 hahaha
Im deeply hurt I thought it be the dart game.
Antes estaba en español :(
Disappointed when I didn’t here “where in the world do these international chips come from” and this wasn’t a dart throwing episode :(
The magic masala chips are my favorite chips in the whole world, tied with hot Cheetos. They’re so good
JANEL KNOWS WHATS UP WITH THE SALT AND VINEGAR
also "look at the flavor"
JANEL PARRISH?!?! This is the greatest day of my life (:
"Belgium is germany when you turn it like this"

Nope.
This video needs more Cotton Candy Randy. I think he should always show up.
I want some
No darts? :(
This series is only good with the darts
Anyone here from Pakistan or I'm the only gmm fan from 🇵🇰
I was so shocked that those paprika chips are consided german
Paprika crisps are amazing
She’s from To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before
Lol I have ketchup chips in Virginia USA
From certian angles she looks like iCarly.
Ketchup chips are british I swear??
8:55 link is doing a lot for me
Wait theirs no Ketchup chips in the USA
Pringles aren’t chips.
She looks like iCarly lol 😆
INTERNATIONAL CEREAL TASTE TEST
She and the daughter of that funny Australian zoo man who passed away should meet.
Now I want chips
Where are the darts?
99% of comments about no darts
1% of comments about anything  else
Omg I love ketchup chips I’m from Canada and I can eat a whole bag of those
I love Janelle! She’s so down to earth funny and she seems like a great person all around

Even though her character on PLL was like the opposite
I thought Link was going to blow a gasket trying to pop that chip bag.  :)

Was hoping for a dart game, but I did like the guest.  The episode was still fun.
Paprika is my country!
(Hungary)
salt and vinegar? vwtf :F
so are we gonna forget about the 'tall' flavored pringle?
Do you have dill chips in the US? (We have those in Denmark)
Herrs makes better ketchup chips.
No darts this time for the international foods game, it's too dangerous to play with guests/Chase around
Like daddy mode
9:47 is a gif right there
I thought Pretty Little Liars ended a while ago.
Where are the darts?
Where are the darts?
Are the ketchup chips Adobadas ??
Ask jacksepticeye to be on the show again, PLEASE
You guys owe us double international dart throwing videos next season for this 😂
Tasting chips from other countries is always fun!  Some are really good!
Love this channel helped me to overcome stress.  Love u guys
Wait Pakistan also got ketchup and IT'S SOO GOOD
Thank you for describing the flavour of ketchup chips. So many think it's disgusting and refuse to try it, but it's... Not QUITE ketchup, but it's own thing
Fun fact: If you're going down under, the smell of cheese should be a red flag. Sniff before you lick, folks!
Why am i watching a video  of people  eating chips
Yes they got slanty from Pakistan. Such a classic.
And once again Germany has proven to be the best 😜
I was so upset when they didn’t sing “where in the world did these international potato chips come from” 

I sung it and everything 😭😭😭
I'm so happy that my country is mentioned in this video. I'm from Pakistan btw😊
I always wanted to taste mint chocolate chips I wish it was a thing
Finally someone tried the India Lay's Magic Masala. They should bring it to groceries
I evol ruoy lanahc <3
Dang it, I thought this would be an international taste test.
We have all dressed in Canada too!
You guys finally put Pakistan in a GMM video!!!! I’m so happy even though you picked the wrong Slantys, should’ve gone with the red packaged ones
I miss the dart board......
I was so excited to watch this when I saw the title and so sad when they didn’t have the dart board.
Her hair extensions don't match the color of her natural hair
India, I'm sorry about the memes.

You're the best!

I love my Indian bros, from Bombay to Bangladesh.
Wait. You don't have paprika chips in America?
I farted and it stinks 
=let’s talk about that
Guys, enough about the darts!! It would have been way harder to have her throw darts and have three separate people throwing as well. Imagine the fear on Chase' face haha 
I think that game should be for the just the boyz.
☺
Ketchup chips... Yea dog! I'm Canadian and didn't have a clue that those were specifically from here. Yum, yum.
9:53  Rhett says "I'm going to have to eat a lot of this."  You sure your not just trying to eat all the chips?
No Dart Board? :(
Janel favors Miranda Cosgrove... weird.
A COMPLETE missed opportunity for "where in the world did these internationalchips come from", I'm disappointed
Paprika is just Bell Pepper y’all
Always nice when a guest is down to clown.
was lowkey waiting for ‘where in the world do these international chips come from?’      is lowkey disappointed now.
Rhett: "Paprika has a look, not a taste". Fail, NO soup for you! Paprika rules, its a great, semi-subtle seasoning, its basically my Franks when it comes to putting it on everything
LoVe❤💘
New loml
Darts
Canada's contribution to the world - ketchup chips.  BTW, Herr's makes a very fine ketchup chip.  I prefer it.
America doesn't have paprika chips? They're like the only flavour here.
UK people be like:
ITS NOT CHIPS ITS CRISP 
CHIPS ARE WHAT YOU HAVE BY THE SEASIDE
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!! JANEL PARRISH IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE 😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰😪😪🤪💞💞😘🤤🤤🤤😍✨✨✨✨
Where’s the dart board, I’m disappointed
So much better than dart game.
Are they saying Ketchup Lay's chips don't exist in the US? I see them like every year! I would have been confused by the fact that it had to be Canada.
Same story with the Emmentaler Pringles, they exist in most of Europe. I had them a ton in Germany, they're so good!
MASSAGE
No honey buttered chips? I think they are most famous in South Korea, but I had them in Japan and was addicted to them. And chocolate covered chips too!
They have dog too dog flavor
Women, don't make the same mistake I did. I once touched a razor JUST FOR MEN and immediately grew a beard and started a DIY project
Rhett: "I'm manner than you"
Link: "no you're not... we're both at zero"
This whole time I thought the bro-mein was bromaine.... like masculine lettuce.
I think Jenna Marbles has successfully proven that Just For Men isn't JUST for men.
"Just for men-"
Jenna Marbles has entered the chat
JUST FOR MEN AND JENNA!!!
The perfect name for tea targeted towrds men is masculinitea
Is It Weird That I Watch Them At Night Instead Of The Morning?.....
Just want to compliment Link on singing the intro to the segment, dang, that boy can sing!
“Did we just create a gif?”





Yes! You did! 😂
I love the way Rhett talks to Barbra! And Link just MAN-handles (lol) Jade and she’s just there like yeah he does this.
Jenna Marbles already established that Just For Men is Just For Men and Jenna.
"You're not supposed to breathe that in, are you? Wasn't that what the lawsuit was about?"
Hahahahahahahaha
At 6:20 when Link squirted the soap suddenly by accident and it went everywhere, my immediate thought was, "that must be the guy version" =)
and BTW: "flushable wipes" are still not safe to flush. so just dont. #fatburg
I enjoy some women's deodorants because they aren't as harsh on skin and don't smell nearly as strong as most men's deodorant. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“I’m manner than you.”
“No you’re not......We’re both at zero.”
Even the dog shampoo is gendered? What the heck? But like if it's an excuse to have Jade and Barbara on the show then I won't complain 😂
A moment of silence for every time Rhett pronounces gif wrong
13:00 did we just create a gif?
I'd say the men's soap worked, it got them washing dishes.
Engl. - Ger.

man - Mann
men - Männer

PS: The good tea is always given to the British...
I wear Old Spice Hawkridge because I prefer it to women's deodorants. I usually prefer men's colognes, too, because they're spicier, and I don't like floral or fruity scents.
Now we all know that just for men is not just for men



It’s for Just Men and Jenna™️
I've been using Irish Springs for 4 years now because my skin violently hates women's soap. 


It also smells better.
13:04 

Rhett: “Did we just create a GIF?”

Me: Y E S
Ok I need link to finish that intro song and post it on spotify please
EXACTLY! Like tampons. Guys have nose bleeds too!
Rhett: "I'm MAN-ner than you."
Link: "No you're not. We're both at zero."
You didn't include the energy drink for homosexual asians.



If ya know, ya know
"Can a man use a woman's product?"
Me:
WOAHHHHH guys can use pads???????
Please help
6:22 “That was poetic” I swear to god Rhett’s subtle jokes are the best. Hahaha
“Can a man use a women’s product?”

Me: “Well if we can’t then I’ve been doing the impossible my entire life” 😂😂
Video idea: try things for humans and animals and have to decide which is which (shampoo, blanket, snacks/treats, accessories, etc)
Y'all should've tried the Bic pens that were specifically for women.
Let's get a video of right-handed guys reviewing left-handed products?
This is one of many reasons i thew away my gender so i can buy the cheaper product
Cotton candy randy seems scary to to take peoples calls tbh
I would love to see Rhett and Link do a mukbang!

I know you guys eat stuff like weekly but to see a fully unedited Rhett and Link and the crew doing a mukbang in More would be awesome lol
Who remembers when Schmidt had to market sponges to men 😂
"Man" in german ist "Mann", "Manner" means the same as "Men's"
Did we just create a GIF? 
Yes Rhett, yes you did. 😂😂
Ladies, if you go up to a man's place and see the Hero dish soap : run.
I think that it doesn't matter if you're a female or male - just use whatever you want!
If you're a male you can use the "for her" products
If you're a female you can use the "for him" products
This video is amazing :D
"No you're not we are both at zero" - Link 2019
I don't get the whole this is for men/women  like FOOD IS FOOD imma eat and drink whatever I want 😂😂
7:59 I do love some mrs. Meyers lemon verbena/basil/orange blossom. scented anything
would watch an entire video of Rhett and Link washing dogs, tbh.
That body powder part made me laugh so hard. Rhett and Link are hilarious. 😂
12:50 damn link how bad does it sweat down there 💀🤣 you used a tonnnn !!
6:20 
Link: "Woops that went on the other one"
Rhett: Slips in "Well thats poetic"😂
Body Powder part had me rolling lmao
I'm always tickled by how Rhett talks to Barbara.
Lets Dink the Dark one 
Link 2k19
"Go girl energy drink; for passionate and energetic women" that explains why I've never heard of it lol.
dogs enter screen BRILLIANT, PERFECT, BEST VIDEO EVER, WELL DONE, 10/10
Um, Link’s singing in the intro is amazing!!!
How do you just cruise passed "lady anti-monkeybutt powder" with no reaction 😂
9:19
Wow, Link. Keepin' it segregated, eh? I thought we were past that.
R
Rhett kinda reminds me of an enthusiastic version of Ron Swanson
"This one here...its got DARKNESS in it." Yea we do ladies...
“That was poetic” I’m dying 😂😂😂
I'll never forget when I was around 14 years old and my younger stepbrother had jock itch after football games. I gave him Vagisil power and laughed for the year 😂
6:00 that film student would get an F on that project
I once saw a For Him/For Her BREAD.
The most talked about male vs female product would be razors, super disappointed there wasn’t any leg shaving.  Come on guys!
13:03
Rhett: Did we just create a gif?
Me: Yes Rhett yes you did...
Enjoyed the ultimate frisbee shoutout lol
Isn’t the correct term for a male breeder dog a stud?
I think about needlessly gendered stuff all the time. It boggles my mind.
Watching two 6 foot+ men wash little bitty dogs just made my day.
It's normal to have gender specific products. 
Just, not EVERY product. The ones make sense.
Jade is so adorable. More dog videos please!!
Not good to turn away Link
Absolutely thought that "bro mein" was a variety of lettuce when they first said what the prize was.
link sealed both of their fates the moment he said "I feel like I need to turn away to do this."
3:09 is that Keith from try guy’s laugh?
12:37
Is grandma a gender?
I was expecting them to eat the soap and powder.
Rhett said: make you feel more manly 🤣
I use dollar shave club razors and other personal care items all the time! <3
Oh yeah that powder scene is definitely becoming a meme
I only buy mens razors. Theyre usually much cheaper and better quality. The pink tax is insane
"Männer" is pronounced more like "mennar"
Rhett: “Did we just create a gif?”
Link: sniffs fingers
I do drink yogi tea for women "frauen tee". it's supposed to help regulate hormones. but I agree that most of the for men/for women thing is simply marketing.
Rhett: "I'm manner than you."
Link: "No your not,
We're both at zero."




🤣
Yay there returning on my B day 😝
The German word for man is Mann
Should’ve included a price comparison between the products, too!
I knew the energy drink one specifically because I drink a ton of Monster.
Link starts segregation 9:21
link really put that masculinitea in him singing the title card song for today's game!

i burst a vlessel on your behalf, bro!
Do a real life operation (the game)
In regards to the intro song... Ronnie McDowell did it better ;o)
Yup. Definitely a GIF worthy moment.
it's hard to believe that there is a dish soap made for men!!  Jade and Barbara
were adorable in that kiddie pool.
You literally answered your own question in the first 2 minutes xD
Ok,that intro song that link sang was actually so good!!
Just for men? Nah, man

JUST FOR JENNA
Sometimes I wonder if these guys are purposefully making innuendos. 🤣😂
Skip to 12:58 with zero context before watching
How do you say this rhett?  13:03
GIF

Now this.
GIFT
"dogs transform when they get water on them"

Trying to say Barbra and Jade are gremlins, link?
I need Link to do a full parody cover of the game intro song! It was really good!
6:21

Link: oh it went on the other one

Rhett: 
Apocalypse talk again from Rhett
4:07 its funnier when you German too😂
 'man' means in german 'Mann'
And  'men' means 'Männer'
I like how Rhett and Link are literal giants but their dogs are so small 😆 it's so cute lol
Y'all should do "Will It Soda!!!!" With candy or whatever you choose but definitely try it please.
Y'all should do "Will It Soda!!!!" With candy or whatever you choose but definitely try it please.
Y'all should do "Will It Soda!!!!" With candy or whatever you choose but definitely try it please.
Y'all should do "Will It Soda!!!!" With candy or whatever you choose but definitely try it please.
How did neither of them react to lady anti-monkeybutt powder?
At this point we should just take a shot every time Rhett says something about the apocalypse 😂❤️
You call it a “stud” I think
12:19 
me: HE  HAS VANS
There's darkness in that tea.
Isn't go girl also that product that we-
Yes
tested where girls pee-
yes...
while they're in a car-
yeah.
Or anywhere else besides the bathroom?

Yep.

 for anyone wondering
“I feel like I need to turn away to do this.” 
Officially weird, Rhett and Link. Lol just the way I like it.
FOOR A MAAAAN OR A WOMAAN 😂 that was genius!
No, the german word for man is mann, men is männer. Love y’all btw:)
Rhett: A female dog which is called a BEEEP
Me: 😲 WHEEZE!
I need to talk to my cotton candy daddy 😭
6:24 OMG hahahahaha "that was poetic"
Razor for men: $5
Razor for women: $8, but it's p i n k and that makes everything better.
Glad Rhett and Link finally found a way to incorporate DLC into their show.
Okay the doggies' bath was so freaking cute
Subtitles: (hip hop music)

Blind people:
Is no one gonna talk about how beautiful that intro was? xD
Daaanng, Link that intro song was fire! 🔥
Okay... but have you guys seen the makeup for men???
Wheres Jenna when you need her?? The queen of just for men 😂
I love Barbara's little bows!! Jade is so sweet and cute! Their dogs literally steal the show every time they're on.
"That was poetic" was literally the only reason I liked this video. I am twelve.
You created a gif by mentioning the word gifXD
Cotton candy Randy is awesome 👍 👍
He’s a dude, she’s a dude. We’re all dudes, yeah.
Barbara actually looks like rhett somehow what the heck 😂💕
Monster ULTRA ZERO IS MY FAVORITE
This was one of the funniest episodes I've seen. Particularly the part with the powders
I really hope this game song makes it onto LTAT ~~~ <3 Stevie
this was the perfect opportunity to have jenna marbles on the show 😂
June 3rd is when I graduate
The German word is for Mann
Takes a sip of the energy drink







Starts drinking it faster
ok but link sounded pretty great in that title card actually tho
"Did we just create a gif...?"
😂😂😂 yeah i think so, there is no goin back now
“No you’re not we’re both at zero” 🤣😂💀💀
"That's poetic" RHETTNO
“That was poetic”

Underrated quote
That intro song was truly quite impressive!
Just came from a season one episode 19 
It was good wholesome fun
I love using Just For Men to dye my eyebrows!!!
June 3 is my birthday
1:18 that was impressive LINK !!! deserved claps for sure *claps
Man I can't wait to see bts clip of Link trying to sing this on ltat 😂
That song intro! That was beautiful Link!
"This one here has got darkness in it" 😂😂😂
The intros have come so far from Good Morning Chia Lincoln. 😪 Like if you remember.
Happiest part of my day 🤩
When I was younger, I was shopping with my mom and I chose a glow in the dark ninja shirt.

Friend- why did you choose a boys shirt?
Me- it's not, it's a glow in the dark ninja shirt
I actually love dude wipes. They are thicker than normal wipes. They also smell amazing
Link: I feel like I need to turn around for this one 
Guys NO you know what the internet is like
Not only do I prefer men's razors, I also prefer men's shoes.
Links I got your Ace Ventura reference!
The bows on Barbara’s ears are just so precious!
12:57
I'd like to imagine that they discussed how they were gonna get themselves demonotised in this video.
1:00 another thing added to Rhett's apocalypse stash
"Wow that is very mild."
You can wash dishes too, dude!!
There should really be an uncensored version of GMM😂
OMG I havent been here since the longest time... THE INTRO , I wonder how many times its changed lol
It's 2019, Rhett.. We've all agreed on the hard "G" pronunciation of .gif.
love how theyre complaining there are no tampons for men.
The shirt that Rhett is wearing 
The bulldog looks just like the one I have as my school mascot
Jhs 157
the fact that rhett gave his dog lil bows on her ears
anti-monkey butt powder?
“Oops, that went on the other one.” 
“That was... poetic”
gendered tea... EXCUSE ME! as a brit i am deeply outraged, tea is tea, it is our life blood there is noseperation, PGtips
lady anti monkey butt powder XDD
Was I the only one thinking the prize was a head of Romaine lettuce?
Have Jon reep on. You can make a railey quiz
Rhett talking to his dog like that.. Jezus xD my names Barbara... I cant😂
I use a lot of men's products, razors especially.
OK but that intro song though!! ❤️
Singular: "Mann"
Plural: "Männer" or "Maenner"
I can attest that manly dudes really like Ultimate.
yeah that's gonna be a JIFF
Here I am...watching two grown men washing fake dishes while dirty dishes are sitting right in front of me. 







That's really  
the german word for man is ... mann
maenner means men
Is Ear Biscuits gonna continue during the break?
Someone make a .gif of rhett smelling his quads 😂
Rhett says jif....</3
"Did we just create a gif?"
Oh Rhett.. You've been in this game long enough to know the answer is always: Yes.
I'd love to know, who decides what the intro song is gonna be and who wrights the lyrics. And what comes first.
One could say that sharing the bromein among bros was aprobro
Squirts on other bottle

Rhett: that was poetic
tampons: now for men
I literally wrote my dissertation on this... unsurprisingly Rhett and Link made it a lot more interesting to talk about.
Yes Rhett, someone will definitely Gif that.
June 3rd is my due date❤️
yall should react to: adults react to Good Mythical Morning.
it’s wednesday my mythical dudes 🔥
Did we just create a GIF?? 🤣🤣🤣
This is such a great vid! Keep it up
A Male dog is called a sire....for some reason...or just a dog idk
Rhett and link trying not to be controversial for 15 minutes
Lol I use dude wipes
Talc can potentially contain trace amounts of asbestos, probably shouldn't get your face so close to it 😬
Wow was that Link singing in the intro? Because,  d a m n
I wish we had gender neutral tampons.
I like how Rhett just casually mentions the apocalypse lol
Barbara is like "What did he call me?????" Lol
Just ordered my tickets for the Jacksonville, FL show! I’m so excited you’re finally paying a visit to the sunshine state! 😍
sees a cup of  tea this one’s got darkness in it
When Rhett put the water on Barbara, her tail slowly raised and I lost it 😂
One question for these products that apparently exist.....Why?
Idk why but I always route for link
Dope or nope channel
I really want a Go Girl energy drink, but I’m a male
12:59, bruh I thought this channel was family friendly
12:58
Youtube : DEMONETIZED!!!
Where do I find a job like there’s, there job is to bath their dogs jaja
Yes, I wanna play Ultimate!
June 3rd is my birth day
"that's poetic" dying rn
12:59 link we did not need you to turn away!! That was an unpleasant sight 😂😂😂
2:37 Link has some Charlie Murphey in his drink
"That doesnt smell great," he says, sniffing a wet dog
Why did link say bromane like that ive watched it six times back now and i am mesmerized lol
Oh boy the intro song to this one will be fun to see on LTAT
"Dish Shoap"😂
Barbara: 
Please don't embarrass me on camera 🐕
When you said bromein I thought the prize was going to be romaine lettuce lol
I feel like nobody had a clue as to how this game was meant to be played. Kind of amusing really.
Manner tea more like MANNATEE
Hey June 3 is my birthday
Link: sprays soap on the other bottle
Rhett: Well that was poetic
I love Barbara and Jade and how gentle their dad’s are. So sweet
Why is no one talking about Rhett's face at  8:26??? Comedy gold!
Rhetts been getting pretty cocky on the swearing in recent episodes 😂
😂😂😂 "do we JUST STAB ourselves with these to indicate??? AAHAHAHAHHH!" Omg I lost it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rhett's face in the intro 😂😂
They should make tampons for men
okay link... 13:19
I feel personally attacked as a frisbee player by the “wanna play ultimate” on the bro-mein lol
Link looks too serious with that shirt on.
Link was goin HAM on that dog there.
lol this is "men try womens products" in true rhett and link fashion
A male dog is called a sire
Heyyy I'm here to thank you guys, for making my day even on days when it was not going well. I know doing a daily show is hard and takes a lot from you guys, but I want you to know that all that is not for naught, I look forward to this everyday and some days, I plowed through my day knowing that I can sit down and watch you guys, and forget about the misery that was my day, even if it's only for 30 mins. But that 30 mins I consider as my escapism. So thank you very much guys.
OH MY GOD I LOVE DUDE WIPES... MY BOYFRIEND BOUGHT THEM AND I HAD TO LOOK IT UP TO SEE IF IT WAS OKAY FOR WOMEN IT IS AND ITS SO GREATTTT
“So one for a female dog which is known as a (BLEEP)”
I'd like to see crandell Lee newton the original but sketch guy on the show
Are you guys going to do a season 3 of Buddy System? because Season 1 and 2 were so good there has to be a season 3
Jade and Barbra are so cute😊🤗!
Omg is no one commenting about that GIF moment?!
Seems like there hasn't been any tie breakers lately.
i love these guys so much they really dont discriminate WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This show has gotten uncomfortably raunchy
I have a maltipoo as well and can confirm they look like giant rats when wet 😂
Link is such a better person than Rhett.
days since rhett has mentioned the apocalypse: 0
did we just create a gif? 

Is that even a question? Always. Yes.
JUNE 3RD IS MY BIRTHDAY
I honestly love that Rhett’s dogs name is Barbara 😂
I see we’re bringing politics into GMM
The love yall have for you dogs is awesome, jade is so cute
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 87: "I feel like I need to turn away to do this" - link
Why aren’t there attack helicopter products
I wanna know the age and type of people watch Rhett and link. Comment your age and somthing about yourself 💗
Can you do something with twenty one pilots
Yo that was good singing for once good job
wow that is m i l d
Lol June third is my bday must be a birthday present
What’s the name of the actual song for the intro
Its like you guys are always fighting for top but we all know your both bottoms.....
Do this subject again it was really fun to watch
I dont often like a video but this deserves it
Barbara is SUCH a sweetheart
One's for a female dog which is known as a BLEEEEP!!
Much love to you two Männer from germany
this episode was so confusing
Why Rhett talks to Barbara in office passive agressive way?))
1:18 I think that's link singing right?
12:58 was the best part. 😂
My favorite line 
Rhett- Im manner than u

(Was expecting Link to say they were equally manly)

Link-No ur not we're both a 0

😂😂😂😂😂😂
This intro should be on the behind the scenes songs on LTAT
I need a behind the scenes of Link singing the title card for this. PLEASE
Flashbacks to the manly rap
what a great community you boys have grown here! Its great to meet everyone! Welcome to entertainment headquarters here! :) Always a sweet show boys
I think a male dog is called a stud 🤷🏾‍♂️
@12:58. you’re welcome.
This is the content I live for
Link is on something
Wow, wasnt sure if they sang the intros live, but I guess they do.
My girl uses my deo because, "it smells better," and uses my razor because, "it works better." I started buying extra of both. Happy mom's day y'all. It's the little things that count.
rhett’s dog’s name is barbara.... I love that
I get the same brand of razor as my gf
Link looks like he's trying to drown his dog and the dog's just trying to escape
I love you guys so much been watching for about 5 years with my family thank you for always making my day so happy!
Lmao I have a friend who uses girl's deodorant (and he's a guy)
Barbara and Jade where the best part of this video!
I saw my teacher drinking the Go Girl drink one time. No wonder it looked so familiar.
The german word for man is „Mann“ Männer is just the plural: 1 Mann, 2 Männer.

And on the Tea stands „Männer Tee“ what means: Mans tea. A tea for mans
You damn well know that there is liquor in them go girl drinks ha well played ladies.
Limk has the better dog hands down.
Link’s song intro was flawless
I like dude wipes tho
Rhett, male dogs are called "sons of (beeeeeeeeep)es"
Never been this confused watching a gmm episode
I wish they had a community college form to look at😂
The german Word for Men is Mann   ( Männer is the Plural)
I need that gif :3
I lost it at the powder 🤣 The dog washing was very sweet 👏
Female dog = 'B**ch'

Male dog = Just a 'dog'
Products for normies and grils alike
"Isn't that what the lawsuit was about" 😂😂😂
Did we just create a GIF? Yes, yes you did.
A cotton candy randy show huh
Really can't wait to hear more "daddy" and "sweet nothing" jokes
The back of my favorite cereal lists its benefits to womens health
Nooo manner is plural for men.
Tea without milk?🚨🚨🚨
When rhett say one cloudy on the tea it make me think of cloudy chance of meatballs
Anyone else think of Jenna Marbles when they said “just for men”? 😂😂
I love how the wheel of mythicality video had Mr. and Mrs. mugs in it! I see what you did there and I respect it! 😂
We need more Damnyell and Richard!!
Barbara looks so cute with those bows on her ears.
barbara has bows in her hair!!!! 😍
"Can a man use a woman's products?" 
Yeah but you should ask her first.
That Bro-Mein's got alot of Bro-tein. That's what makes it dude-rific.
A what Rhett?  Did you just call it a JIF?!
Your friends at FBE just told us that you saved Smosh! Can I request that one or both of you make random appearances on You Posted That?
Powder Test... THAT... WAS..... HILARIOUS!!!!
Prove that gender label stuff is mostly hogwash
Jade looks like Richard. 😂
I need the Gif
I want jade 😩💖
Ever since Yorkie bars had to be changed I haven’t seen a man item in ages
Barbara is precious
Any time I see Link with his dog, I just think that Link should not have a dog.
Nah the German word for man is Mann
lol that turn away powder shot.. no way it will instantly become a GIF
I can’t wait to see this singing to without the intro screens covering it!
Did we just make a GIF?
What is summer? I'm from Michigan were their snow days in the middle of April
9:17 that's low key segregation
Rhett: 6ft 7in, Link: 6ft, Me: 6ft 4in. I would fit in perfectly
Fun facts for gf that worked in advertising. Companies dont just created a random label or product for men/women. The do a ton of focus groups and product testing to ensure maximum profit. So his/her products come from the people wanting his her products even if they are identical.
I am judging them because of their inacuracy to pronouncing round one's tea because I'm taking German
The German mispronunciations ....
😞
You should do will it guitar
Lmao so close to a Dutch rutter moment!!
12:59 send that part to your friend with no context
12:58


no context needed
Do a store bought bagged popcorn taste test!!!!
"Männer" are multiples. "Mann" is singular for man.
I love when both pups make an appearance
I watch GMM more than TV 😭
Jade is cuter than Barbara :3
Not a lot of lather.... man that is fun to say
12:58 is all I’m gonna say 🤣😶
I know what he said at 8:56

Todays Song title was on point Linky.
8:36 and the best reason to see this chapter will be there
Mythical summer is a winter hiatus down here in NZ
“I’ve never been so confused by powders in my life”
The German word for man is men Amana means special herbs for mystical things
Any video with Barbara and Jade gets an immediate like! :)
Woahh the title song 👏👏👏
"Did we just create a GIF??"

Everyone-- "Yes."
Männer is the plural of Man in German it's pronounced more like "men-er"
6:37 let him wash the dishes. He wants to sPoNgE!!!!
You guys should guess for men or women products and their prices..
12:49 that was beautiful 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:50 Don't use "flushable" wipes. They clog up sewers because they don't break down.
I can not stop laughing when they get to the dish soap part.. omfg
yikes, the content quality. where did it go?
rhett’s dogs name is Barbara and i’m happy about it
This episode tastes like soy 👀 lol
Yeeeehaw. The best thing to watch before ya schleep.

Also, I loooove the intro song bits. Reminds me of songs i haven't heard in a while.

Also, also, it's always great when we get to see Barbara and Jade. :)
6:20 When I haven't seen my girl in over a week
Good to know I'm not that only one who has issues with pronouncing dish shop
barbara got big!! snap
ok woke kings 👏
Correction... just for men and JENNA
i dont know if turning away was the best idea guys lmaoooo when they looked at each other to see how the other one was doing it lmaooooo
Congrats on #12 on trending
Why is nobody talking about how hard Rhett and link smashed that “for a man or a woman”
Intro song?
energy drinks are full of sugar
Link's dog looked so awkward when water was being poured on her... 😂😂😂
13:19 Link doing a hodgetwins impression.
5:39 so thats tommy wiseau right
5:11 when you think you are outsmarting your friend but fail
12:57 and 13:20 need to be cut together . 😏
do a will it guacamole
Okay so were not gonna talk about how link hit those notes in the game name
you're here for this :  12:58
I hope @8:55 isn't censored. Even if I know what it is. 
DAMNIT YOUTUBE!
Yes skip the 321
Gmm you have to get Gordon Ramsay on this show
Never thought these types of products existed....... until now....
Did this video come from the brodryer idea? 😯
Yes Link, Rhett is manner than you.
geeeez i remember your first video
Oh no...Rhett says a gif is a “jif”
Get Adam Conover!
Probably the best song parody title they've done yet.
This was great
3:03 Why thank you!
male dog is a stud
only if used for mating though
man in german is just mann, manner means mans or mens
logic seemed to fail on most of these...
men is "männer"
man is "män"
We don't have go girls in the midwest😥
Okay but can we talk about link singing
Best title ever 😂
Go gurl!
Male dog is called "sire" 😉
JUST FOR MEN & JENNA
Me and my girl did the same exact same thing but it ended a lot differently, (it's gonna be on my channel!!😄😅)
I got 11 points total😂
You should get Ralph Garman and Kevin smith to be guest host for mythical summer
I remember as a kid when Yorkie chocolate bars had a no women sign for the o on the packet. 

I ate them anyway because it was just normal chocolate and I didn't think about it but other kids panicked and screamed at me because women couldn't eat them. They said it made girls infertile 😂😂
Early/ Notification Squad, Lets Geeetttt Ittttttt!!!🔥🔥
Give us more plzzzzzz 👌👌🤪🤪

Cotton candy Randy ;)
Where can I buy Links shirt?
What breed is Jade? 😍

Link is my mythical creature.
It snot mike up puffed he
Barbra and Jade always make me smile 😃
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!
Wish the Cotton Candy Randy show was free ):
This episode got a little complicated for my night shift brain (night shifters will understand)
"Regular tazo-chai-vanilla" Um... no, that is not regular...
who else wants to see a Rhett and Link and JK studios (formerly studio c) colab?
I use Dude Wipes everyday
I’m pretty sure 13:20 is an Ace Ventura reference and I like it.
Obviously, Rhett and Link don’t know that Just for Men is not just Just for Men, it’s For Men and Jenna (Marbles) 😂🤣
7:26 WELL OKAY LINK
Noooooo we will be missing Link’s birthday!!!
7:56 "...non-gendered Mrs. Meyers...".  Disagree.  When a brand has a gender-specific name in its title, it is DEFINITELY a gender play.  And strangely enough, if designed correctly, it can be a play in both directions.  For your thought exercise: "Mr. Clean".  Who was the target market, and how/why did it work?
Ree this is a GrEaT video
There was a missed opportunity to prank them both with the powder.
Menthol powder (for slight fun) or Itchy powder (for laughs)
It’s not just for men 

It’s just for men & Jenna
Does anybody know what type of dog jade is (links dog)
A jiff? What's a jiff?
i like how the 2 tall people got 2 small dogs
Where's the Notification Squad at?
It's JUST FOR MEN and JENNA
A male dog is called a Sire
It's got darkness in it!...
Link looks like Shcnider from one day at a time
Why isn't "the gif" number one comment?
12:58 I don't know how I feel about that.
FAKE my aunt drinks monster
Omg my sisters dew day is June 3
I get Luna bars even though Im a guy.  Its always been weird to me (and my ex, a woman) that on the packaging it specifies that its specifically for females.
Men's Tea by Yogi
Men have skin too
I

OFFENDED€!!!!
the men's dish soap looks cool, i normal use dawn which in my opinion is just better then the other dish soaps but i would totally at least try the men's soap because it looks cool xD
conspiracy theory episode- One Direction is getting back together in 2020
TACTICAL SOAP
rhett and link literally stereotyped each product lmao
I feel obliged to comment
GMM IS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!
The female dog joke had me floored
A male dog is called a Sire

JADE N BARBARA 😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️
Male dogs: Dog or Sire (as in, these puppies were sired by)
outro song?
6:24 guys after no not November
Rhett: I’m more manner than you
Link: no, we’re both at zero
For the first time ever, gmm did something controversial. Mom, get the champagne
Their doggos are precious
The german word for man is mann, men is maenner
I've been using Secret Invisible Solid Powder fresh since I hit a little after I hit puberty. So yes we can, female stuff is better sometimes anyways
We need more dogs on this show
Manpons, for that time of the month.
Male dog is the Stud
How to water board a dog FOR DUMMIES
My husband uses my deodorant in a pinch
In prison the men use women's deodorant because it's the only deodorant offered with antiperspirant.
Correction: Just For Men and Jenna*
i love that they are always in the trending page
Wait that means the first guess was right
Anyone else uncomfortable by Rhett wearing a graphic tee and link wearing a Rhett style shirt?!
I think hygiene products are really "dude-ified" is so that guys will actually use them. Some guys have complexes and are afraid of looking feminine for using wet wipes lmao
9:10 good doggo commence
1:09 Correction; it's Just for Men and Jenna
It's not just for men. It is just for men, and jenna (marbles)
That was a Confusing episode
You call a male doggo a stud
Watchmojo vs MsMojo 😒
That go girl thing made me cring so hard.
A male dog is called a stud! 🙂👍🏻
Love Rhett and Link surfer dude voices.
I'm manner than you😂😂😂
Manner tea
Manatee
The men’s dish soap was in a dark container

Video starts at 2:02
The male dog is actually called a ‘sire’
DO FAST FOOD FISH SANDWICHES
Did anyone catch the "poetic" comment about the soap. lmao.
If it's in pink packaging that means no boys allowed.

Also 12:57 is probably the best moment in GMM history.
just for men AND JENNA
" i think the baby ones for men" so is every baby product. Men are babies.
I know a lady who uses dude wipes
I have a she-wee. No more sitting on nasty toilets or fing around with seat condoms !
A male dog, in breeding circles, can be called a "stud" or a "sire."
I also use guy razors because they are way better.
I love Links' puppy! 😍
I think companies do this to try and expand the market on a product bought by predominantly one gender.
aw, I'm gonna miss you guys when you're gone. have a good break though <3
best episode ever
Your dogs are so cute 😭❤️
I think a male dog is a stud
I don't think men have had a problem doing dishes since about 1975
12:58 

Youresoloud: here i come
havent really cared about the Mythical Society. But now that they have a Cotton Candy Randy Show I AM SO DOWN ITS UNREAL
Male dog is a Dog or Sire 
Female dog is a B*tch or Dam
wet jade looks like a ferret
When u come for a normal video and u get doggos
Please change the intro to the first one

not jiff,,,,,, gggggggggif plz
I'm not a fan of small dogs, but jades so cute 😍
Gmm notification squad
im offended that there is no vacuum cleaner option for gender
tf is a body powder
How many times do u get copyright striked for your parody’s
Hmm dont disappoint me Rhett and Link, you dont have to be politically correct
dude i wear my wifes undies all the time, she doesnt mind, because she doesnt know :D <3
5:59 i really laugh at here lol
Next up is baby powder just for BABIES?!?!
I could taste the tea at the beginning
barbara is SO CUTE
I got my mom some "Anti-Monkey Butt" for her birthday. She got me back with regular "Anti-Monkey butt"
Greetings from Germany :) I feel embarrassed 'cause of the tea :) Btw: "Mann" means man and "Männer" is the plural "men". The correct sentence from Rhett would have been: I'm männlicher than you.
Ther goes rett and apocalypse
One time I found just for women earbuds...
JUST DRINK IT!!
Preordered your book and now I just have to fast forward to October
The dogs are so adorable 😍
They interrupt each other so much
This is awesome
I miss cptton candy randy
Man! The season is ending AND my school laptops are being taken ON THE SAME DAY!! 😢😭
Am I smelling a little virtue signaling?
I use what smells like dog shampoo
Am I the only one that heard "LaDy AnTi MoNkEy BuTt PoWdEr...     !"
I dont see the problem, if someone wants to buy a gendered specific product go for it lol.
loving barbara's bows - really upping the accessory game
8:55 lmao 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The german word for man is manner because manners maketh man
I'm getting so old, I swear Summer like just  happened a couple months ago lol. And yet it's a year later.
Männer=Men
In german😂
We need Jenna for a guest 😍
I FREAKIN LOVE BARBRA
I USE DUDE WIPES!!!
Emphasis on test
My question is: who the heck uses dish soap and stuff in this day and age when we have dishwashers?
THE APOCALYPSE JOKES. NO.
Jade looked so cute in this video
3:42 so they were right?
Is it bad that I own dude wipes
I honestly and truly appreciate that you were clear about not believing those generalizations. I know you don’t, but some people don’t understand sarcasm. Great job guys!!
Dogos: WHY AM I HERE?????
r&l said gender activist rights!
Germany! 🙌😀
Btw. The proper name for a male dog is Sire.
Yee Yee 💪💪
12:57 

no words
how about that dish shoap yall?
I like using Secret deodorant it actually does the job better than Old spice or degree
15 seasons in and they are still awesome.
I believe a male dog would be called a "Son of a B*tch." Please correct me if I'm wrong.
enough yt for today 13:00
Who else watches GMM at night? 😂
So... 
Where’s the gif ?
I’ve always hated the way Americans say herb/herbs.
Just For Men.. and Jenna ❤️
They make "his" and "hers" products so they can have more variety. Even though it's the same product.
Barbara & Jade need their own show 🐕🐕
Will it bread
Can we PLEASE have a dedicated video of just Link cleaning things?
I love how everyone is pissing their pants for being afraid of saying something offensive.
Wait. Didn't they get the first one right?
mens dish soap? yeh f or men who are pansies. im a man i use dawn  likke everyone else. who are these  companies and what bullsht marketing reserch daata are they gathering.
Dear Rhett: Jif is a brand of peanut butter, not a short repeating loop of images.
The powder bit had me lol when  link said to rhett I think we should turn around facing the wall while jiggling their shorts getting loads of talc down there lol it had me in stitches 😂😂😂😂😆😆😂😅 that  was ie a really hilarious moment
This is the 20th episode I watched today where Rhett says ApOcOLyPSe
the blue's for boys 4:19
More food episodes
it had been scientifically proven that rhett and link are the most creative people on youtube.
Male dogs are referred to as studs.
When Rhett stands up his head disappears from the frame.
Barbara has the pinkest nose of all time
Dang. Link singing the intro thingy....❤😮
male dog is called a pup btw
Barbra the dog 😂
Just for men (and Jenna)
Who got the "that was poetic" joke at 6:19?  hahahaha
G: Good
M: Mythical
N:Notification-squad
My name is jade :D
I once shaved my legs with a man's razor and I immediately yelled at my Fiancé "WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT MEN'S RAZORS WERE SO MUCH BETTER???"
I love Barbara's ribbons.
I love Link’s shirt
Dad!Link is really my favorite. I like this shirt a whole lot.
I'm gender and sexuality neutral
It snot mike up puffed he
What’s the song that Link sings, what’s the name of it
Male razors vs female razors. What a gimmick
I always thought dude wipes were for....you know
anyone know what the original song for the paradoy at 1:18
Link's dog is so DAMN CUTE!
Last week I came across toothpaste for men. Just, no.
call male puppers Sires
Greetings from Australia 🇦🇺 🇦🇺
The people that were in the Smoky Mountains were at Westgate Resorts!! I go to that resort all the time.
I use men’s deodorant..I have for years it works better then women’s! And I also sometimes use men’s Cologne just cause I love the smell!
Jade is more cute
A male dog is called a stud especially when it comes to them breeding
*Jenna Marbles drinking energy drinks years ago*: it's pink like me cuz I'm a  girl!
2:22 Garth is that you? #WaynesWorld
The whole time during the doggie bath I was like RHETT TAKE OF BARBARA'S BOWS THEY'RE GETTING WET
before i even watch this I just hope they talk about the pink tax
Their back on my birthday best give eva
I don't think any of these products were very equivalent.  How about trying some things from the same brand?
2:04 Link are you sure that's snot mike puffed he?
okay but tell the lady in the back to shoosh
When I was a kid I would get a “more masculine” type toy...probably explains why I got bullied
The term for a male dog is a sire
Your channel has always given me good summer vibes I remember when I was 8 like 4 years ago watching you guys all summer 😂
You guys are awsome
A male dog term is a "stud".
How is the dish soap mens?
What am i gonna do everyday nowww
Probably but it would be shamefull
This episode is kinda bad. Rhett and link weren’t their normal self.
Nooooo im not read for yalls break
Will ltat still happen ? Every sat
I was kinda hoping Jenna Marbles would be on this episode!
By the time they got to the gendered dog shampoo I'd already lost faith in humanity
They're trying so hard to be PC
Hello Daddies
Vigorous powdering
Noooo! It’s ending! 
Yay! Summer episodes!
BARBARAAAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE HER
The girls getting tired of this job u can tell how she responds lol the attitude girl....
Dish shoap.
did you just assume a gender?
0:00 "can a man use a womans product?"
Me: "yes"
I just saved u a whole video your welcome😉
Those look more like cats than dogs, guys.
Well, that was awkward.
I'm glad they did a count down on the second time for guessing. It helps get rid of any unintentional influence on decision making.
Can we just applaud GMM on that remix of Michael Bolton's 'When a Man Loves a Woman'?
Jeez I just re-loaded the page about 30 seconds after clicking on this video and the views just shot up by 1k!!!!!
Male dog is a "stud."
HAHA  I was just about to comment about the Go Girl pee funnel that my mom has then I got to the part in the video.
You guys are coming back on my birthday. Well well well. Happy birthday to me ☺️💙
Dude, stop smelling your dogs
Hey just like bra’s they are meant for woman but i wont believe in that generalization because i have seen some dudes who needed one more 😂
The women in my household use dude wipes
Link’s hair, doing it for all the boys and girls with daddy issues
I'm a man that used women's shampoo on accident once. I was instantly pregnant.
I disagree link.. WE all know Rhett is MORE MANNER than you... HAHAHAHAHA
I’m just here to say Links dog is definitely the cuter of the two
I'm a vet student... an intact male dog is a stud. and if you were curious, an intact female cat is a queen
I think I’m in love with an allergen
I want Barbara
The intro singing "For a man or a woman" that part was surprisingly gr8 coming from ppl who cant sing...
How can there be 15 comments with only 5 views?
You said it
“Can a man use a woman’s product?”

James Charles: am I joke to you?
Why does their have to be a female energy drink.
Didn't Shane do this first
Original song 1:18

When a Man Loves a Woman

Percy Sledge
#TeamBarbara
One word: Fragrance.
Tying for Link is like winning for Rhett
Uhhhh Just for Man is meant for beards and since women typically dont have beards, why would they need beard dye?
jade is so stinkin cute
i can't believe rhett and link just ended sexism
You need to be on tv
Just For Men? I thought it was called Just For Men...and Jenna
What is the actual song name to the intro Rhett sings ??
wait those are dogs?
I’m a man and I use tampons for bloody noses
I learned on an episode of Judge Judy featuring a dog breeder that the male is called a "stud"
Did Barbara just lift her leg and pee at 10:32?
12:58
WTH!
I may get some flack for this but I actually love Go Girl drink. When I used to work super early shift once a week (as in I had to wake up at 4am to go to work) Go Girl was the only nice thing about getting up that early. So yeah, I might think most gendered things are ridiculous and I'd like it no matter what it's called but it is indeed my favorite energy drink.
#dinkthedarkone
A male dog is a stud
Wow good mythical summer is coming up already this year has gone bye so fast
A male dog is called a stud! Lmfao how lucky right??
Just wanna let you guys know I saw you’re faces warp and morph like crazy when I took an 8th of shrooms for the first time ever some years ago, love your show lol
Male dogs are called 'Studs' or 'Sires'
13:00 already decided to make gif before Rhett said anything. This evening you can find it on p-hub.com; among others in a compilation I’ve been making.
I love how Rhett and Link are already completely confused right after tasting the first product.
Gendered marketing is so silly.
This is gonna be a great video I can tell already.
Hey everyone! Who else jumped at the opportunity to catch a GMM video?
“Did we just create a Gif?”
Lmao 😂
i was confused as to why there was only 104 comments then i realized this was posted 4 min ago.. NOTIFICATION SQUAD
The German word for man is Mann, the German word for men is Manner
12:58 
12:58
I’m done 😂
Idunno why, but looking at their wedding bands makes me think they're married to each other lol
actually, its just for men and jenna
No dog products?
This is so sexist like why can’t men use dog shampoo
Dish shoap
God its so sad that we live in a world were Link has to clarify that these are jokes....
9:05 iweunvba
I would think the red drink was for boys
A male dog is called a stud lol true
Really needed Jenna Marbles on this lol
I can't use men's razors for my body, they are almost too sharp and I get so many cuts every time.
man isn't manner in German, it just changes because it has a word after it. same goes in English, instead of saying 'man tea' you would say 'man's tea'
Links dog is a dachshund right?
What about baby products... this is discrimination I use baby wipes on the daily.
Episode idea: Debate GIF vs JIF. Sorry Rhett, if they wanted it pronounced JIF they would have given it a J at the beginning of the word. If both Rhett and Link believe that it's pronounced JIF, I'd be more than happy to drive an hour to your studio and present defense for the correct way to say it. GIF.
"Women's" products are always more expensive than non-gender specific and male products.
I want to watch them wash their dogs for LTAT
Wanna play Ultimate?
What about perfume?
What is with Link’s shirt? Is he really trying to be a dad from 2005?
allies of the century
Just for posterity, a male dog is a stud.
13:00 👌
I immediately got an old spice comercial xD
Like this if they should have their kids on more! And if they should do will it soda or will it juice
12:57
1:10 @jennamarbles
I ask that all the time
I aint seen these guys in like 10 years loool
A male breeding dog is called a stud. The more you know
Barbra’s little bows in her hair😍😌
Before you finish the video go to 12:58 without any context
His dogs name... is Barbara
Gender is a social cooooonstruct
Did we just create a jiff ? No but you might have created a GIF
A male dog is a stud
FYI many butt wipes for men contain menthol and other ingredients that may irritate a lady's front area.
What about the other genders?



Just kidding I don’t care
a gif is now on the air :)))
I feel like gender products are here to reassure hetro people of their straightness.
I really don't care for barbara
Everyones walking on eggshells in this episode lmao sad
Link is so much better at washing dogs
Did the bro mein box say "Wanna play Ultimate" in reference to Super Smash 'BROS'?
I’m offended because you didn’t include the other 76,042.6 genders. 
Bigots.
9:30  Did Link just assume that dogs gender?
12:59 I-
The word for a male dog is "cur".
Wth was this.
It’s GIF. you don’t pronounce Graphics Jraphics do you?! No. Or play with a Jolden Retriever. Or watch Jardians of the Jalaxy. ITS A G
Make a line of shirts with these products called masculinitee and a femininitee
I’m confused, didn’t they get the first one right?
13:04 my name is jiff
Agenders: QUAKING
Goddammit these guys turned into such wussy soyboys
I think the point system is s not wring..
there is no difference between male and female brands. its all the same
Some his or her things does make sense. Like men's shampoo since we have more oily hair than women.
Male dog is a Stud
Rhett: Gently massages his dog with the soap

Link: Absolutely attacks his dog and man handles her
The slow motion noooo of them getting water into their dogs ears lol
Did you ever react to your body beard idea? (Happened during your 200th episode)
The dogs are so adorable
deodorant is definitely gender reliant. men's products are harsher on the skin and usually have a stronger scent, where as women's deodorant doesn't sting to use and women usually don't need as much scent cover up as men.
I think this is them tryna see how sexist r&l are lmao
Cant believe he said gif and not gif like you’re supposed to say it
Im a microwave. These products do indeed offend
the correct term for a male dog is actually “son of a b****”
When your a wamen watching Rhett and link😏😳🤤
Male dog is referred to as a stud
on my birthday im joining  the mythical soicety :)
I don't understand most of these
Who came here after watching their  fbe episode
13:04 You created a gif not a jif, Rett... We say graphic not jraphic...
we stan
I prefer using man's razors because they're cheaper and also it just seems they cut closer.
Doggos!
12:58 Best friend goals lol
I swear if anyone says the pink tax I’m going to lose it
Barbra looks like such a peaceful soul
I use Women's body wash because I'd rather smell like cocoa butter over "sports energy"
screw the pink tax/price discrimination
12:57 at 2x Speed
They clearly didnt think of this video idea. It doesnt seem  like something they would do
Ah yes, the genders of body powder: Grandma and Baby.
In German:
Man = Mann
Men = Männer 😬
Incoming comments about there being more than 2 genders 🙄
5:00 It's really sad that we are in a time where that has to be stated.
Most gender targeted products are for fun and shouldn't be taken seriously 
C'mn
so clearly you guys couldnt find enough male vs female products. considering this is his vs hers its more like his/hers vs gender neutral...
rhett and link being naughty 12:58
2 minutes in and i’ve has to pause it because now i want a cuppa tea
It's just a dog...
I liked my own comment now you do the same



l
V
Why do people talk to their pets
A male dog is either called a 'stud' or a 'sire' in case you guys were still wondering about that. :D
Just for Men and Jenna 😂
Rated R
There's only two sexes/genders. Prove me wrong.
Just for Men and Jenna 😂
13:00 oh boy does that look weird
Did they breathe in talcum?
Male dog is called a stud.
There are only two genders.




Change my mind.
I have an idea for the next game yous play (I'm a big fan) it's call what was on the a plate that a crew memeber ate it's where you try to guess what food was on the plate and whoever wins gets to eat their favorite food and the loser eats their least favorite food
Link gay 11:56
A male dog is called a sire.
A male dog is called a sire.
Yo am I the only once who noticed they’re trending literally everyday??
I use women's razors for years, matter of fact, used the same pack of razors for the last 4 years, still have two unused. They just do not go dull as quickly
I like how they honestly took so much time just to find these products that aren’t even popular
Will. It. Dog!?
Male dogs are studs
I prefer women shampoo, I still buy the dove for men or whatever but I find myself still using my girls shampoo lol she prefers clean smells over flowery anyway so win win.
Season finale is next week's* Friday. Not next Friday
I just want to thank you guys for being a good entertaing when my parents divorced it was hard on me and I could just escape for a moment and watch you guys
Iam not ok with this they should of washed there own heads
Who’s psyched for the Cotton Candy Randy show?
Rhett & Link, the kind of guys that would believe in the "pink tax".
Hello, comment section!
Why is no one talking about how big Jade got????
As a woman I love the dude wipes, I just wish they would change the name.
They are funny and weird
I could listen to Rhett and Link slamming gendered marketing all day
A lot of things are specifically made for certain genders specifically for body chemicals that only one or the other produce. Or produce more of. Such as certain vitamins and deodorant. Even some soaps. I use to enjoy using strictly male body wash and deodorant, but came to realize it didn't work with the ph or whatever chemicals in my body and none of it lasted. I went to female versions and they worked way better. We can use whatever, but sometimes those kind of products are labeled like that for actual reasons. Same with vitamins. Not all, but a lot of female and male labeled vitamins have chosen vitamins within them that targets what those particular genders need. Doesn't always work, but it' what they were originally going for. It's all a general diognostics. Never made for one person alone. So not all will work for there intended perpose. Again, I'm not saying all products with gender labels are necessary like that. But many are for certain reasons.~ {P.S. - Now I use an all natural deodorant that isn't intended for any one gender. And it lasts me all day with one use. Two if I'm sweating a lot.}
man, hets are strange
12:50 hmmmmm
So can I eat women vitamins
Male dogs are called studs.... your welcome
12:58 no context... just watch
Wow lol!
These Americans don't know how to drink tea 😤

Male dogs are called Bastards. Considered a swear

I bought men’s razors today because they’re cheaper (and work better)
I'm surprised how overly PC the world is today his and hers is still a thing. "Did you just assume my gender" etc.
Energy Drinks are FOR SPORTS/EXERCISE
They replenish electrolytes after you use up your energy.

If you drink an energy drink without a need to, you're hurting your body and your cells.
Gillette?
I wonder which dog is going to get an ear infection first for getting their ears wet.
i can't believe they used male dog shampoo  on female dogs
well actually just for men isnt just for men its just for men and jenna
12:57 ...yeah...
just for men... and jenna
A male dog is a bastardaé
Pozdro od Mniej Więcej 😄
I use men's razers cause man they shave so much better than female razers
I use women's conditioner even though the brand I use has a for men version.
I bought a body wash today “for men”. It’s called Bilt ~ For Men of Style and Substance. It claims to strengthen and invigorate. Of course give it was marked down from $9.97 to $1 at Walmart so you decide
just for men, and jenna
Just for.men... and jenna
Im German. To the Defence of the Tea: Yogi Tea has to teas for Woman and they are awful (they taste Pink. No Clue how they did that Trick) but the Most of the teas are really really Great and tasty
We need more calorie blackjack episodes
Those are not dogs they are rats
A male dog is just called a dog but an unfixed one can be called a stud
I am SWOONING over link's song parody
PSA body powders are actually gendered for a reason because many body powders include talc which has been shown to be cancerous to women when applied "down there," so if you're a woman using a body powder for that reason please buy a female one or make sure it doesn't contain talc
Excellent video idea
No Rhett you did not create brand name peanut butter! (13:04) You did create a gif though. The g in gif stands for Graphic not Jraphic!

What kind of dog does Rhett have?
Jenna marbles would be proud.
12:53
A male dog is a sire
A male dog is a stud
Jenna Marbles this video is for u
Rhett: A male dog is usually called a "Stud". More often used when breeding, but  thats what i perceive the male dog would be known as. Someone correct me if im wrong
why is Barbra the prettiest dog i’ve ever seen
One is for a female dog which is called a b*** hahahaha
Cotton Candy Randy  gives me the WILLIES. No offence
You can tell Rhett does not wash the family dog. hehe lol    Link definitely washes his family dog.
Ahh female dogs
Is mythicality a word???  No, it’s not.
12:58 is so suggestive ngl
Just for Men is for men and Jenna Marbles
💖💗💖
Never seen so much sexism in a video
Why there were no signs for us which product was which gender like you usually do!? What happened to #postispeopleto?
the stupidity of gender roles, illustrated perfectly
What kind of dog is Jade? Because I want one.
Link, just for men isn't just for men it's for just for men and Jenna
RHETT SAID GIF WRONG
Hi
I thought there was 76 genders?
I use men's razorblades for shaving because they are like 4 dollars cheaper than womens "same stuff"
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
anyone else here non-binary? i'm tired of gendered products, especially the unnecessary sexist price difference
I'm surprised that they had such a hard time because with hygiene and beauty products absolutely everything for men has a very strong, musky smell, like even the pomade when it's like sure, lets pair that with the shampoo, body wash, and deodorant to smell like a man to everyone within a 10ft radius
Discount Seafood Warehouse in Boston Proper sent me here.
Ich Bin Eine Man
JUST FOR MEN ISNT JUST FOT MEN ITS JUST  FOR MEN AND JENNA
I use women’s conditioner because everything men’s is friggin 2-in-1






Also it smells good and makes my hair feel nice
90% of the comments = Jenna Marbles
Am I the only one who awwed when the dogs came on?
This has almost nothing to do with this video but just an idea: y’all should go on that show “the masked singer” cause you would tear. It. UP
Is grandmaish a word???  No, it’s not.
Who is shushing the crew when the crew laughs? Let them laugh!
Just for men and jenna
Just for men and jenna
12:58 that does not look like they're using body powder
Why is Rhett’s dog a adorable little cloud?  I love they love their dogs...is that weird? I love when men have their hearts melted but animals
Their dogs are so cute!!!!!!
just for men is just for men bc it’s oxidative color which can damage the hair a lot, but men typically get their hair cut more frequently than women, so it does not affect the overall health of their hair’s cuticle
Correction, Just for Men is for Men and Jenna
Usually people are more likely to buy something if the demographic is specific to them that’s why certain products are targeted torwards old people, young people, men, women, teens etc.
A male dog is a stud
hi rett and link u guys should make episode of ice bath with hot pepper  think it would be great idea
Can there be a Barbara show on Mythical Society?
Male breeding dogs that have not yet fathered young are called stud dogs, and once they father a litter, they are called a sire.
It’s actually just for men and Jenna because ya know, Jenna radiates BDE and maybe Wamen too
Go to 12:58 without context
Gender specific body power makes perfect sense. Also can you imagine me putting on a women’s version and smelling like girly flowers all day? I would pretty much have to kms, that or buy a flannel and build a fence to make up for it.
what on earth is a body powder, if it is not for babies????
Of course they are the same, there are no scientific or biological differences between genders. Purely a social construct.
Gendered marketing is literally just a way to make us buy the same product twice
“Non gendered dish soap Mrs. Myers” I think the Mrs is identifying because there is no Mrs Myers in real life it’s a company. Also have y’all seen that study that showed products that were pink cost more like razors and tooth brushes & bottles of anything
Woman's deodorant is great
Isn't that what the lawsuit was about?
People should be able to tell what's for their gender it should be common sense.
Just for men... and Jenna
someone call jenna...
Wer spricht hier Deutsch?
theres more than just two genders just saying...
The only difference between products marketed to men and to women is the pink tax.
Why Americans always drinking their tea wrong?
Put milk in it, savages!

As a British person I’m angry you didn’t put milk and sugar in the tea
The deesh soap.
Mānner is actually german for men. Mānn is german for man

The male dog is named either a sire or a stud.
Challenge: don't read any comments about jenna marbles in this comment section. It's impossible at this point... #why?
My boyfriend uses dude wipes and they have come in handy to both of us while traveling especially when you’re stuck on a bus/train for 8 hours and have sticky food fingers. At least that’s what I’ve used them for.
Just for men... And Jenna!
jif
i don't know much about perfume but i know were women belong and that's in the kitchen and the bad booom
JIF
rhett & link baby talking to their dogs is the cutest thing ever
omg Barbara over there was trembling from even just that tiny bit of water while Jade was just like "Dad. Don't get water in my eyes, don't get....you got water in my eyes."
Hoe mein lo mein for women.
Rhett pats his thigh is not for babies.
it seems like all the gendered products are s****ier

Also, male dog's called a Stud
What breed is Jade? (Link’s dog) she’s super cute and I’m curious.
12:58  ROFL
They should have tried a men’s product and a female product and guessed which was marketed to whom.
Just for men is not just for men... it’s just for men and jenna
Ms Myers soap is the manliest product known. That stuff can clean anything.
watching you wash your dogs was adorable
this get demonetised instantly for the gif they made lol?
Okay but like link did good singing “for a man or a woman”
could someone please link me to the video where the "Brian" joke started?
12:58 Aaaand demonetized lol
On the energy drink one my brother asked "is that GFuel" and is said no these are the DUMBEST his or her products
Thumbs this up if you also knew what song they were gonna use for the game title!
When will Jade be available on mythical.store? I need her.
Did anybody else get uncomfortable with the amount of powder link put on his private parts?
What was the none-gender tea called??
I remember the earlier episodes, whenever Rhett needed a made-up female name he defaulted to Barbara, and that's what he named his dog later.
Can you just bathe the dogs for an entire episode?
trynna be pc but come on yall are clearly reading when you say all those gender shouldnt be targeted hmm...
What is the melody from when he said “from a man or a women”
Do you think they ever wish they weren’t friends but have to pretend for the show?
Just for men...and Jenna
Male dogs are side's and female dogs are bi**h's.
I switched razors, and, guess what? THE GUY ONE WORKED BETTER. Female products are a lie.
Are those commercials actually real? Damn...sad if they filled their purpose
Dude wipes really shouldn’t be for anyone. They do NOT make you smell fresh at ALL 😩
Can't wait to see this one sung without music
Link handles animals like a toddler and it makes me nervous every time 😂💀
25 days of school left!!!
Manner tea is lovely ❤️
Yoursoloud is gonna have fun with this one...

There is many names for a male dog. Sire, stud, and gelding
I knew they were gonna sing that song at the beginning
Only real people will remember    "Hi I'm paul"
ANARCHY
The people at the end in the great Smokey mountains look like they’re at my friends old cabin in tellico plains. Same view and railing.
RHETT a male dog is a son of a bitc*  (bad Tv show bleep)
What is the song at the beginning?? “For a man or a woman”
“And why is Just For Men (and Jenna) just for men (and Jenna)?”
Wish they described the scents, I could have played along with three then. For the first two though, got which one wrong (but was right on gender) for the first and was right for both gender and which product on the second. Fourth, got which one right but gender wrong (mind, it might have helped if I knew anything about the scent beyond "Perfume". Perfume itself as a term is a touch gendered to boot so...), fifth not even trying you didn't describe the scents for all three
Yes why are there gender marketed products.. I want tampons for men!!!
Yes and no but really depends on the product a man can use lady razor blades this is a woman can use men's razor blades or vice versa but there are some products a man cannot use simply because he lacks the parts that the process used for and same thing for a woman I don't need 14 minutes and 58 seconds to explain that
Just for men and Jenna
Stop baby talking to your dog! Yuck.
Great song intro lol
GIF!!!
12:58 without context...
It’s gif not jiff peanut butter
Jenna Marbles should have been on this episode, so she could correct you it’s just for men, Jenna and wamen.
You call a male dog a good boi

That tea doesn't look like tea
is it me or does link look a bit like rick moranis
No offense but Link looks like Garth from Wayne’s World 😬 Sry
jenna marbles just for men'd her face soooo really it's just for men and jenna
nice video
A male dog is just called a dog...isn’t it?
Find yourself a man who talks to you like Rhett talks to Barbara.
What's a male dog?!?




A son of a B!%$CH!
Just for Men is NOT just for men.. it’s just for men and Jenna
Yes it is gif, and I think you did just make one.
I'm lovin the past two episode jingles lol
The body powder part was hilarious
I love their interpretation of men. 😂 Bro soap bruh, it’s got technology and heroes. It’s stronger than that girly Dawn soap. Ummm, not likely though. Nothing beats Dawn.
you can wash dishes too,dude!
LeTS DiNK THe DaRk ONe
Link has had a dog for years and he still looks incredibly awkward and rough when handling her.
"Can a man use a woman's product?" No , its impossible,  the universe forbids this
Can we let the boys know it’s not Jif it’s Gif
12:58 someone make a gif of this now
Bro-Dyer?
barbara looks exactly like my dog and i got freaked out for a second
Will it coffee creamer?
Pretty good guess but männer is more than one man. It means men.
Just for Men and Jenna*
12:53 This video has been demonetized.
Male dogs are called dogs, but if your breeding them ive heard of them being called a stud, but if your tracing lineage the male is a sire, the female is a dam.
There are only 2 genders.
I bet the dish soap was made by a bunch of moms who have husbands who don’t help at all
This dog section before I even fully watch it. I’m guessing HIM by tropiclean 😂😂😂
Did we just create a jif?
youre going full woke, never go full woke.
6:19 "That was.. poetic" xD
Monkey butt needs to be  Universal 🤣
Best Jingle ever !
Lactation tea would have been funnier...
I like gender stereotypes and gender roles. Sue me
Im impressed by Link's pipes on the title
Male dog = stud
Du bist Männer. Ich spreche deutsch ein bisschen. 😂😂
Unnecessarily gendered marketing is one of my biggest pet peeves lolol
Why is Link yelling?
Barbara looks like Rhett.
Yesss
The difference is price
I’ll watch Rhett and Link wash their dogs any day !
I remember in school most girls wore the men varient of Ax Body Spray because it smelled better than the womens versions. Same with cologne (which is pretty much just perfume for men). At this point they might as well just make everything gender neutral except menstrual item for obviois reasons
Hi
Male dog is considered a stud unless nuetered
Not sure but arnt male dogs called studs or dukes?
This was very confusing
That's so sad, you stop the day before my 2 month point in my relationship
"Dink the dark one." GMM 2019
Männer means Men in Germany 
Mann means man
Since I'm currently enjoying donuts I bought last night, I'm wondering what grocery store sells the best "quick sale" donuts that are good the next day.
At 3:47 what the heck happened to Rhett ?!?!!!
My nursing instructor is cringing at that powder application
LMAO "you are not supposed to breath that in right? isn't that what the lawsuit was about?" that was gold.
The Pink Tax is real.
Ofc a man can
it's concluded that when maltese dogs are wet, they look like rats
Mann is = Man in German

Manner is Men in German
Who knows, they could be wearing gym shorts almost every day and we would never be able to tell !
6:23 Yah little nasty.
Honestly i was expecting to see some genderfluids or something in the comments but im surprised
Won’t this video be taken down for assuming there’s only 2 genders??
You guys really bleeped the proper term for a female dog?  Good grief, what have we come to?
Female dog, yes... I think male dogs, especially breeding ones, is "stud"? Not sure, though.
“Why is just for men just for men?” It’s not.. it’s for men and Jenna
All them other fake genders punching the air right now lolol
"I just wanna clean and I wanna clean now." D:
They are wearing SHORTS!! LoL
but if you are energetic..why do you need energy drinks
If I buy Hero Clean maybe my sons roommates will feel like they can help with the dishes. Ha ha ha
I think the gender market thing is kinda fun but food tho?
male dogs used for breeding could be called studs ( just a factoid )
A male dog used for breeding is called a "stud"
Just for men & Jenna***
Wait, did Rhett just say that when Barbara gets wet, she looks like a Rhett?
Learn about the differences between men and women's consumption habits in:  "The Consuming Instinct", by Gad Saad.
Often women’s products are gendered the way they are because women have been shown to be drawn to them and yes they are a little more often times. That isn’t sexism though it’s because they’re simply taking what people are drawn to and marketing it. 
Same goes with toys with kids 
If you want to just buy the cheaper razor, shampoo, etc
Good mythical morning ended sexism
A male dog is a dog. Dog = male canine (not exact definition)
YouTube trending is cancerous.
Rhett & Link trying not to be sexist for 15 minutes straight
It really makes me angry that companies create gender specific stuff and it makes me even more angry that there are still people who think they can't use stuff that is designed for the other gender. There is just no need for that much insecurity.
Male dog is a butch.
It's not but a male dog should be a butch.
A male dog is just traditionally called a "dog"...female is the blurred word Rhett mentioned.
Hero products aren't really marketed to men, but they do use some of the proceeds to help returning and wounded soldiers financially. Good product for either gender. Also their febreeze-like spray smells awesome.
"I'm manner than you."
"No you're not...... We're both at zero."
It's pronounced Gif, Not Gif.
"I busted a vlessle."
Great video and well pronounced German 👍
I busted a vlessel
Do theses actually get filmed in the morning
I am disappointed that Rhett skips leg day...
what about a "ma'am" can they use these?
They used the powders on all three legs 😏
I use dude wipes! So much softer then baby wipes for anything baby wipe useable
Rhett looks so sleepy
Yay you will be back on my birthday
Link sneaked a peak down Rhett's shorts at 12:54 and Rhetter returned the favor at both 12:59 and 13:01.
Buttogatto
😂😂😂😂
If your in the comments early then here is a gem for you without context 12:58
What kind of dog does link have!?
So 2 genders? Big statement boys xD
Just for Men isn’t just for men... it’s “Just for Men and Jenna” 😊
Barbra’s little bow,,, I’m losing it,,,
Perfect timing! I get back from my vacation on June 3rd!
PLEASE use today’s theme song for a compilation of them singing without the graphic and music!!
Barbera and Jade are my two favorite GMM guests
Anyone else see that drip of handsoap that presumably landed in Link's mug? (8:30)
13:19 lol link
Bic Pen for Women?
A male dog is called a sire
Wtf is Männer tea I've never seen that
Being a college student, I had to learn about this. The reason it is done is for what is known as the pink tax. Simply put, it’s when you take a product aimed at men, cover it in pink, and charge extra claiming it for girls. They even brought up beer for girls in my class.
I just did a research project on this and to see GMM do a whole episode on this, makes me so so happy
They're trying so hard to not offend anyone. Can't blame em tho...
I came down to the comments to see how many people would say “SEXIST” but I’m surprised how little I found
Is this gender natural episode?
Man in German is just mann not männer. Männer is men.
I love it when the morons who make these genderized products, make commercials "for women products" and it's all one big "girl's are pretty, going to the club, so hot" like, they do know this will mostly just resonate with dudes who like girls, and not women themselves right?? xD
Actually it’s “Just For Men and Jenna” duhhhhh dink dink
hey you know what's interesting here is Rhett just discovered the his and hers for dogs is Gender Specific there's no word for male Dogs only Females i'm highly offended xD lmfao no jk doesn't matter in my opinion getting offended is obviously more damaging to the world making changes without getting offended would probably be fine but hurting people in the process is unproductive
A male dog is called a Bastard. missed opportunity Rhett.
Just for Men is actually just for men and Jenna
What kind of dog names are Barbara and Jake, I laughed too hard
Please make this a series; this is quite possibly my favorite video ever
I swear link says whoops or some variation of whoops, atleast once every episode 😂
June 3rd Is my birthday
It was better facing forward lmao
8:56 so my parents were watching me ummmmmmm
12:50   Quality Content....
they got the first one right
The German word for Man is Mann
Every guy that uses these items is named kyle, drinks monster energy, and is too insecure
#blessled
'when a Mooooom makes a costuuuuume........ she uses stuff from around the ho-oouse'
12:47 Looks like they're getting ready to play videogames with Mr. Sark
Why is the energy drink commerical so low quality and stock looking?!?
No mention of Dr. Pepper 10? Certainly one of the more confusing marketing strategies in recent years.
I believe, if memory serves, an intact female is called a b*tch or Dam and a male is called a stud or sire.  Spayed/neutered is just male or female.
Just for men and Jenna*
“Can a man use a women’s products? Let’s talk about that!!”

Me, a genderfluid: Um....
Antimonkey butt- what? Jeez, America.
Women's beard oil anyone?
Bevidas basura son esas
Thanks Rhett & Link! Let us know when we can treat you to an entire steak dinner.
If you go to a steak restaurant, ask for a specific cut, and they say; "We only have small, medium or large."  ...Just leave.
Link was getting the Medium rare the whole time and Rhett only noticed Once
Rhett: "taste my steak!"
Link: "i dont want to"
Rhett: "you dont have to"
HAHA
I'm so proud of Link,  a full episode of knife usage and no close calls.
Would've trusted it more if they didn't know which restaurant each steak was from before judging
longhorn steakhouse should also be a contender on this, recommend that place
I knew it would come down to Outback and Texas Roadhouse. If only one of these places served warm yeast rolls with honey-cinnamon butter that could serve as some sort of a tie-breaker. Oh well.
Texas Roadhouse wins in my book. and THOSE ROLLS!!
Texas Roadhouse is better, and cheaper. Oh... And rolls. Rolls with honey butter. 

I gained 2lbs thinking about those rolls.
This should have been a blind test.
I can’t take this video seriously without Longhorn Steakhouse in the mix.
Before I watched this, I KNEW Texas RoadHouse would win.


but i stand corrected sadly
sees that Sizzler is a part of this 
Me: "I've never heard of Sizzler" sees sizzler steak remembers I'm in the south 
Me: "that's why I never heard of that place
So who's gonna tell Link he actually likes Medium Rare steaks?
Links Aussie accent is hilarious and offensive at the same time 😂
OH man, I thought this was gonna be a blind taste test..... THAT woulda been so much more satisfying to watch hahah ... non-bias.
im suprised that longhorn steakhouse wasn't included  but i loved the vid
Texas Roadhouse is the best. Outback is an over seasoned second.
This really should have been a blind test!
I feel like their ratings are more accurate when they're blindfolded.
Outback steak & a blooming onion.  Forever & always
......has Link ever heard an Australian accent?
Texas Roadhouse tops Outback anyday!!! Better steak, rolls and sides
I was lowkey hoping for this to be a blindfold taste test, bring it back guys. 🤧
I love Western Sizzlin!!!
LINK- They closed that TGI Friday’s that you’re talking about.
Texas Roadhouse in my favorite restaurant steak
I work at a Texas Roadhouse and never had their steak before
Link's Australian accent:  What if Ringo Starr were doing a Richard Nixon impression
Sizzlers and TGI Friday’s over Longhorn and Logan’s?! I don’t understand West Coast stuff.
I work at Texas Roadhouse and as you can imagine I saw that comin😌

    COME EAT SOME OUTSTANDING
                       STEAK
                           🥩
I want a steak now 😭.
If the Sizzler steak had been enjoyed in any way I would've stopped watching immediately. Good call.
“Texas Roadhouse”

My brain: 

𝑹𝒆𝒙𝒖𝒔 𝑻𝒐𝒂𝒅𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒔𝒆
None of the steaks look good to me. 

I do like a Texas Roadhouse  bone-in Ribeye, medium rare.
Seeing Rhett not cut his steak down the middle is really irritating me for some reason
Why wasn’t this blind?! Seeing the name creates bias 🤦🏼‍♀️
Pretty sure everyone knew outback and Texas was gonna be top two
Looking forward to Josh's cooking show, gonna be epic
I work at Texas Roadhouse, my heart ached when he put outback above it :(
How did you skip longhorn steakhouse?
Cary, North Carolina! No way!
Harry and Izzy's Indianapolis FTW
Please do a higher end steak chains; Ruth's Chris, Flemmings, Mastros, Morton's etc. !!!
I've nevr been 2 a Sizzler..Dont hav them up in BFLO NY..But I agree if they just say all we hav is small..
medium & large..Do a 180 & leav..
Nevr had a Chilli's or Applebees steak..So cant coment on thoz steaks..I do like Texas Road-
hous..But I like Longhorn Steakhous bettr..
He needs to never attempt that Australian accent ever again 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Taste of Texas is the best
This comment is gonna get lost, but thank you guys so much for having quality subtitles for your videos. As someone with hearing difficulties, the subtitles help me so much in being able to enjoy your content.
is it cold warmed in oven etc
Ray's The Stakes in Alexandria is the best steak I have had, but I have never been to Burns in Tampa.
Well lucky me,I live in Texas!😂
Medium rare is the only true way to cook a steak.
I like how Rhett said he wanted it medium rare and they kept giving him the medium steak.
Texas Roadhouse is my vote but I'll go watch now...
Only Rhett and Link can make this type of video entertaining
That Aussie accent sounded exactly like Sharon Osbourne 😂😂
Spoiler alert-> order from a steakhouse🤣
I definitely think Link was getting Rhett's medium rare steak a lot of times.
WTF there is literally a WART on rhetts TGI FRIDAY steak 8:36
I work at Outback and I love their steaks. I always get a ribeye.
Man, sizzlers is way better at the location I go to. This is just dissapointing
I'm not that patriotic, and I'm pretty much a pacifist, but hearing link try to do an Aussie accent makes me wanna wack em with a boomerang.
I’ve been to both and the Texas Road House gets my vote
Man you guys should try Logan's Roadhouse, but Outback was always my other favorite
Tasting steaks at work makes day much better !  Great to know. I'm very pleased with the results  👍👌
Anybody else internally scream and get goosebumps when Link’s knife scraped his plate?(7:00)

No...

Just me?
Who else is pumped about getting some mythical chef Josh content?!
Why not a blind taste test?

That Sizzler abomination guaranteed I'll never set foot in one.

Links Aussie accent sounded like a Mad Max character with an addiction problem.
Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn are the two best steakhouses ever! Sad they didn't have Longhorn!
Longhorn is best!
omg this was the video i didn't know i needed
i hope link never ever does an australian accent ever again
@8:30 - I know exactly where he means! i live in cary! i know that TGI Fridays well! I used to do 919Dine (like a local PostMates service) for them!
I live in Cary, NC and I know the exact TGIF that Link's talking about lol. 8:21
Ah come on ... Sirloin?
I'm guessing its like cold steak since it looks so dry.
Link: I only like medium done steaks

Eats medium rare everytime
Longhorn... NO COMPETITION
Texas Roadhouse steals are so good... I've never eaten at outback but my lord... Texas Roadhouse...
Texas Roadhouse...more like Texas ROADKILL
Missing Saltgrass & Longhorn steakhouse!
I think they may have kept giving Link the Medium Rare steak instead of Rhett, his looked more pink
How many lbs of steak do you eat per year?
Me: Yes.
Should have included LongHorn Steakhouse my favorite
Outback is my favorite steak besides longhorn
What about longhorns?!
Taste my steak.
 I don't want to.
 You don't have to.......😊😂🤣
WTF?...I eat at both Sizzler and TGI Fridays frequently...their steaks NEVER look like those!
The season finale is on the 17th so    the last episode of season 15 is on the Norwegian national day
Outback has the best macaroni and cheese in the world just so ya know 😂
That TGI Fridays Link used to frequent closed down 😭
R: Taste my Steak :(
L: I dont want to
R: You dont have to.. :c
Soooo western sizzling and the sizzler isn’t the same thing ???? 🤯🤯🤯🤯
do a will it guacamole
Thank you...Outback seasoning is the best!
the fork on plate screeching is so unbearable x.x
rhett: [explaining his decision]

Come on man that Texas Roadhouse looks dry AF!

Thank you this I needed
No thanks. I like my beef cooked.
At first I was worried Link was having a stroke until I realized he was using a “Australian” accent.
Link’s Australian accent😂
May 17th is my birthday. That is what I call Mythical Intervention. So glad I started binging your videos.
4:41 Link just had to cop another feel of that oh so soft cow hide🤣
Link definitely got all the medium rare ones just judging by the color, they mixed up their steaks and Link didnt even care. He needs to order medium rare like a normal person from now on.
Rhett: "I've had a lot of fun at Applebee's"

link stares in confusion
I was fully expecting a blind test then discovering the 'best' restaurant after scoring....disappointed...
Someone Stop Link! PLEASE!
Texas Roadhouse all day but you gotta go with the ribeye
Fair but the rolls at Tx. Roadhouse come with cinnamon butter
It's 5am , so it's time to RAISE THE STEAKS !!!
"picturesque" is Link's word of the day on his toilet paper, isn't it?
Longhorn beats all of these but Outback is definitely my next go to.
Longhorn steakhouse? Wya😂
June 3rd is my b-day :D
So, the two best steaks are from steak houses? 

Color me shocked
Sirloin steak, why bother?
Man the Outhouse is a super seedy strip club in Kansas City. Trust me I worked there
THEY USE CORRELLE PLATES?!?! I love them even more now! :)
What is with the Johnny Bravo hairdos?
I have been wanting a mythical josh series for so long! So pumped!
longhorn????
0:18 Someone pls make gif from Link face expressions 🤣
They all look way overcooked. Disgusting
Texas Roadhouse does have the buns with the cinnamon butter.....
I knew outback and Texas Roadhouse would be 1 and 2 but outback is more expensive I believe so
MY BIRTHDAY IS JUNE 8THHHHHHH
We need a marshmallow taste test. Like namebrand kraft, clover valley, walmart brand, etc
In my opinion Texas Roadhouse is better than Outback
Two weeks without GMM are going  to be challenging for me 😭
Dude I didn't even look at the title and then when Rhett introed, I thought he said "chain restaurant STANK." and I laughed so hard. I was slightly disappointed when I discovered it was STEAK
I love texas road house, and their deep fried dill pickles. I always get the porter house
Hehe, I've been to that TGI Fridays. :
That Friday’s steak better not have been more than 5 bucks 😂😂
Should have included prices. Texas Roadhouse would have won by a mile!
Ok, gotta try the outback steakhouse here in indonesia. Hopefully they have similar standards
Everytime I see Sizzler I think!!!.. Nicki Minaj!!.. #sizzler
Loved this, also should have included Longhorn steakhouse.
Texas Roadhouse, IN TEXAS is best!!
I’m pretty sure Link just invented an accent that doesn’t quite exist anywhere on earth.
Only 55 pounds that seems low
WHAT! No Dennys rep?!?! REDO!
Texas Roadhouse has a really good blooming onion or whatever they call it there
Should've had Longhorn. Three steakhouse chains vs 3 casual chains.
Amazing. Steak-themed episodes are a rare medium well done. 👏👏👏
Medium rare is the best way to eat steak
all the dislikes  are from vegans, change my mind
cant believe how bad steak situation in the chain restaurant in US is this bad tho. 

Sizzler is like middle range price here. but I never ordered a steak there, doesnt seems worth it.
Link, Australia called, I think they wanna give you proper lessons in the Aussie accent.
Texans don’t play about their beef!
1,000 Texans watched this.
The amount of asmr is crazy
But you're bringing back LTAT for the regular season, right? 😭
Rename this "Rett and Link roast sizzler for 14 minutes straight"
Tag your vegan friends!
Texas roadhouse and outbacks are the best
I need an 11 ounce and a shiner bock draft now
chilis has the best chips and salsa in my opinion. i love them
I love Texas Roadhouse, and Outback is good (bit overpriced though). Should have ignored Sizzler's "steak" and gone with LongHorn Steakhouse!
If I may make a little comment on camera placement.

The close ups on Rhett and Link are looking from the center, meanwhile the plate close-ups are from edges of the set. So eg the face camera is on Rhett's left, but his plate camera is from his right. It makes it a little bit confusing to watch.

Thanks for reading :)
Knowing what it is might sway ones opinion.  They shouldn’t have known where it’s from.
Is Ponderosa still a thing? 

I remember being a teenager thinking that was the best place ever. They had great steak.
Bet Western Sizzlin would have won
I swear Link, if you don’t stop doing that bad Australian accent.
The "steak" of California
I live in Cary, nc and know exactly the Walmart you are talking about!!!!
You guys come back on my birthday
........
texas roadhouse is amazing
They should rank the foods and do a blind taste test at the same time blind taste tests are the best
Rhett knows how a steak should be cooked
Medium rare all the way
You get a thumbs up because you ranked correctly.
sour is aged flavor
Finally, something I actually have a stake in.
Saltgrass.  And if you have spare hundreds and a book of matches, Ruth Chris.
I knew Texas Roadhouse would win the first mention.  yal knew it too because you saved it for the last one
A good steak only needs salt and pepper. Maybe a dash of garlic. After that it's all about the quality of the cut. TX Roadhouse has has the best steak.
Steak is my favorite food. This video is amazing.
Link needs to never speak like an Australian again...He sounded more like Jim Carrey as scrooge, who is not English either.
If Roadhouse doesn't win ... it's ribbed ... get it?
OUTBACK RULES !!!!!
that was definitely virgin, not chad
is nobody gonna talk about how excited we are for a josh series!!!!???? gonna miss ltat but we've all been asking for more josh !!
Nobody: 
Link: "gIvE iT tO tHe dOGss"
That's the difference of beef and cow at work.
Our Texas road house and Tahoe Joes are good for chains.
Link's Australian accent: JFK trying to do a Southern accent
Manny's chophouse, fla!
Texas roadhouse has the best steak in my opinion
Memories should not effect judgement
What about Longhorn. I've always preferred it to Outback
This episode was rare and well done at the same time.
Texas steaks FTW! Gotta come to a real Texas steak house for the best steak.
Y'all are missing the best: Saltgrass Steakhouse
Link does a spot-on JFK impression
After this we know which casual dining chain is going bankrupt
Link was sounding mroe like a fusion of Mayor Quimby and Ringo Starr
So, the "steakhouses" had the best steaks, go figure.
Good job I I subscribed
Longhorn has some of the best steak ive ever had.
Biased had to be a blind test to be legit
Longhorn is the best chain for steak ever!
Based on the restaurants, I predicted Outback would win from the start.
love the episode but as an Australian i find that accent Link did highly offensive lol
The outback steak house has an amazing bacon bourbon sauce for the steak. Delicious.
I think Roadhouse serves a better steak than Outback. However, I like Outback's salmon and pork chop better.


Roadhouse is more noisy than Outback.


I like Roadhouse's Shiner Bock better than the Foster's at Outback.


For a budget steakhouse, Saltgrass also does pretty good.
Oh but they're all so good!
When you only watch this because you work at a Texas Roadhouse
Super excited about the new Josh series, he probably one of my favorite members of the mythical crew (I still love everyone else dont worry yall)
You can’t get a good steak in California😂
The attempt to to our accent.. Well, Link, you tried. Lmao
Like for medium rare over medium
Ayyyyy!! Good Mythical Summer starts on my birthday!!
As an Australian, I feel a little offended by link's impression.. 😂
That Brooklyn Nine Nine reference was amazing.
Steaks at Golden Corral is great 👍🏻
June 3rd is my birthday
Why no Longhorn?
Didn’t even have to watch. Already know roadhouse will win. Period.
Texas Roadhouse ....
Tests like this really shoud be blind
Its medium rare lol...your metallic taste is called "iron" hahaha jk
Outback is 110% going to give Rhett & Link a sponsorship now lolol
i work at bonefish grill (which is a family company of Outback) so i was rooting for Outback lollll
Texas Roadhouse is by far, the best of these choices.
JUNE 2ND IS MY BIRTHDAY SO ILL GET U BACK THE DAY AFTER MY BDAY
None of the owners of Outback Steakhouse have ever been to Australia? That explains a lot of the menu.
Almost all of the steaks on Link's side were more medium rare. I think the crew was purposely trying to mess with them.
The Texas outback roadhouse 😂
Texas Road house is my fav
Please Link, if you are going to do an Aussie accent, at least watch Steve Irwin (the Crocodile Hunter)
yall ever tast jakes streak cuz thats the only reason im still with kenna
Link attempts to do an Australian accent me: Link u okay ...?
June 3rd it's my birthday
Links accent is closer to NZ then AU.
I PERSONALLY LIKE GOLDEN CORRAL STEAK.
Texas Roadhouse all day! Everyday!!
I'm not saying I could do better but Link's "Australian" accent is like a mix of bad Italian American/Cockney/New England/New Zealand.
Link's Australian accent at 11:20 had me crying
Who would've guessed, the two best steaks are from the steak resturaunts
I live in Cary, NC and know the exact TGIFridays that y'all are talking about! Sadly, its closed now.
These dudes don’t even like each other anymore lol
Hank: "Firm but with little give, yup, these are medium rare."
Bobby: "What if somebody wants theirs well done?"
Hank: "We ask them kindly, but firmly, to leave."
I hope they are not discontinuing LTAT?!
You should repeat this featuring Gordon Ramsay
Longhorn Steakhouse?
No Longhorn Steak house? They have great steaks.
Ouch, Sizzler got slammed hard.
all my people that know about SaltGrass, yall know wassup
When I heard the lead-in song, all I can think of was Brooklyn 99!
Is anyone going to aknowledge the nailpolish on Link's finger at 5:35?
I love Link's Aussie accent that slowly became that of a Night's Watchmen....
How biased to see which restaurant it comes from..Do over!
Wishing Longhorn was up there!
Lol Links Australian accent
BEST HASHBROWNS PLEASE!!!!!
(btw, Dunkin Doughnuts is definitely the best)
I love both Texas Roadhouse and Outback lol but i prefer Texas Roadhouse
Love how Link has a butter knife and Rhett has a steak knife XD
Left on a shelf chocolate edition
side note: i adore the puns they use for the ranked stuff
I’ve been to Cary,NC
Should of done Longhorn instead of Applebees!
Should've been a blind test.
Super excited for the Josh series!
Links Australian accent remind anyone else of old Gregg?
I say golden corral has okay steak that you can fill up on and depending on who cooks it will make it good or bad.
I love how Link's accent slowly morphed into an Animaniacs-style Liverpool accent.
Has link never heard an Australian accent before?
WTF was that attempt at an Australian accent?
Iv lived down the street from Applebees my whole life and never been there lol
try hono Hawaiian sreak they're pretty good
The last 3 times I ate Outback steak, I wondered why I still went to Outback for steak.  Texas Roadhouse is hands down the best chain steak.
Wait...Sizzlers is still around?
How come I can smell it through the phone...
My Husband and I had our first date at Outback too!
Well Mama got the bad taste of the seasoning for the steak but I just like the seasoning of the steak
Only if y'all could've gotten an Outlaw Ribeye from Longhorn Steakhouse.
Being in Tn. It's good to see all your samples are available here where I'm at now.
When Link did that Australian accent he sounded like he was doing a bad imitation of Paul McCartney.
Y not do a blind taste test..seems odd u didnt
Logan's is the best
I"m pretty sure they kept mixing up Link and Rhett's steaks so that Link kept getting the medium rare steaks and Rhett kept getting the medium steaks.
You have made my mouth water.
June 3rd before my b day!
i call greenscreen XD
Iv only been to Outback and Logan's Roadhouse
Link, I love you man....




But I hate how you cut a steak...
Texas Roadhouse is my absolute favorite. No doubt about it.
I agree that it's definitely between the two, but I would've given the edge to Texas because it's EASILY the better overall restaurant. The sides are also way better at texas.
So excited for series with josh!
Friday May 17th is also my birthday
Booooo! Boo your nostalgia. Texas Roadhouse is the best.
But, just remember that I still love y'all.
The way link eats bothers me so much
1:03 you okay rhett? lol
Texas Roadhouse is ALWAYS best
You cant finish the season this week. I still got two more weeks left of school!
The sizzler steak is shaped like that because it's from the cap of the top sirloin, the best part of it
I work at a Sizzler here in the central valley of California, and have to say you got a boo boo steak... Ours do not look like that. You just went to the wrong Sizzler...🤷
You guys should do a blind Fast Food Ice cream test Like Mc Donalds and Wendys and more like that
Is he doing a John Lennon impersonation
Shoutout Cary!
Shoutout Cary!
That is not medium rare, its definitely medium.
Hey im from cary lol.
I did not know Sizzlers were still open.  All the ones in Chicago area  have been closed for years
whoever cooked that steak from Sizzler should be shot
“That’s a more better steak” -Link 🥩
Link should NEVER speak in an any accent again.
Nothing beats a good ol Aussie streak (yes I'm from Australia)
Invulnerable
Texas Roadhouse is the only one of these that isn't started frozen.
That outback steak is not med rare at all. Smh
Who remembers the first Mythical Summer?✋🏻
Texas Roadhoused definitely should have been number 1, damn bias on Rhett
No Longhorn Steakhouse?
Brownie points?!
I would ❤️ to be in this challenge 😭
Don't do a food episode for 30 days.
Longhorn steakhouse is the best steak from a chain
Did link say "I'm an onion" at 12:31😂😂😂?
dang these steaks are all so dry
surprised longhorn wasn't in this competition. Imo they got the best steaks when it comes to chains.
should've been blind taste test so you'd have unbiased opinions
its not a good idea to watch this video while fasting in Ramadan
Sad news guys, the TGI Friday's in Cary closed down :/
I feel god in this chilis tonight
Ron Swanson would love to do this😂😂
Rhett: "It got higher and it got shorter"
I think the crew is messin with Rhett and Link... it looks like Rhett's getting the medium and Link's The med. Rare
Steak at home is the best.. 

Those chain restaurants steak is plain and small ass portion
I like Logan's the best tbh.
Texas Road House is 10x better than outback
Should’ve tried Longhorn Steakhouse!!
I work at Outback and am currently sitting in the office waiting for all the servers to turn their banks in to me and this was the best way to end my 14 work day ❤️🥩
Ayyy my bday June 3rd
is this video not having enough frame per second ? or is just me ?
Link was so irritating to me this episode.
My dad loved Outback and went there every birthday, but eventually switched to Texas Roadhouse. Good to know they are both the kings of steak!
Also, I’m so glad Mythical Chef Josh is getting his own show!!! He’s a great addition to the team!
I absolutely <3 Roadhouse, their cactus blossom and the rolls are always tops, but I wouldn't pass up Outback either. TGI fridays has great burgers.
You guys have awesome hair
That sizzler steak is nottttttt that! Trust me! It doesn’t even look like that when you order it! It’s freaking amazing!
100000% Texas Roadhouse is 1 and Chilies is LAST.
They should do lobsters from chain restaurants
I recently had a 20 oz bone-in ribeye from Texas Roadhouse, and it was AMAZING!!!
Outback uses too much pepper on their steaks, IMO.
I work at Texas Roadhouse
Texas roadhouse is really good.  Even with all the hype (at least locally) it never let's me down.
The dingo at my sirloin.  I would have to say Texas Roadhouse has my vote...
Steaks should be medium rare or rare.
As an Australian, I demand an apology for Link’s attempted Australian accent.
Why would u wanna go to Australia this place is a joke I no cuz I live there
Texas roadhouse for the ribeye!
i’m from NC (apex) and have eaten at that same T.G.i. friday’s you’re talking about!!
Texas Roadhouse is my #1 and you can have a catus blossom at Roadhouse it a similar thing to the bloomin onion
I’m a prime rib person. 👍
10:46 Lmao is that how Link thinks Texans talk?😂
That TGI Friday’s near Walmart used to be the place to be. It was always so busy! 😂
LINK STOP THE ACCENT IT'S TORTURE
In no world does Outback beat Roadhouse.
I really hope that the general public already knows everything that was represented in this episode, but deep down I know they don't.  STOP ORDERING STEAK FROM RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T DO STEAK!
Texas road house DID NOT START IN TEXAS....   its originated in Kentucky!
You guys should eat at salt grass and cattleman’s in Oklahoma City
Outback: you call that a steak? This is a steak.
As a Texan this deeply offended me
Y'all need a colton's,  they have good steak.
Longhorn should have been on here instead of sizzler
Nobody:
Rhett: try my steak!
Link: I don’t want to
Rhett: you don’t have to
Taste testing steaks for your job. I wish I were your guys.
...
Next episode, they eat dried blood or testicles to determine what animal it is from.
...
Nevermind, I'm good. You guys earned those steaks.
Fastfood BBQ ranking.
Yas! Outback was mine and my husbands first date as well!
It's strange that Rhett likes his steaks medium rare, when he usually starts retching, at anything too do with blood.
Ayy Texas Roadhouse definitely better than outback but they’re spot on with the rest of these
even though im fasting, ill never turn down a taste test from this lot
What about longhorn? Or logans?
Too much stuff to keep up with.
Yall forgot Longhorn steakhouse
Outback had its time as king, but Texas Roadhouse now reigns supreme.
Outback is closing in the KC area...they had some good food!
Rhett, your hoodie is dope.
Texas roadhouse all the way "Brotha"
I will always have a special place im my heart for Ponderosa.
Longhorn Steakhouse should have been in the running
False, Longhorn
ALL LOOKS SAD AND DRY
Wondering if anyone else is kinda intrigued as to why Link doesn't call his mother's husband his step dad?
But....but.....Logan's! Texas Roadhouse is almost as good but not quite.
Tgi and Sizzler steaks look dry.
Being from texas I love going to Texas roadhouse
What about longhorn steakhouse?
This is all about Drugs. Thats ok.
Nooooooo the cooking with Josh is only for mythical society members!!!!! 😢😭
, Rhett and Link had to eat steak from TGIFridays and AppleBees in the same day, oow, That's rough
I know its not part of this rating but Texas Roadhouse's cinnamon butter and rolls makes it infinitely better than Outback
There is no way outback beats T.R.H.
Texas Roadhouse should have won.
See, this is a worth while video.
The fact that NONE of the founders of Outback steak house have been to Australia, is bloody crazy! Never been to one, as I live in Australia... but I have not heard wonderful things 😅😂
Applebees is so revolting that I don't know how they are still in business.
Saltgrass has the best steak.
that’s so awesome he was in cary, nc. i live right near cary!
mornings are always better with Good Mythical Morning
This is like seeing which ice cream shop has the best melted ice cream. How could you judge cold steak!?!?
Jumping ahead to 13:39 was a good decision. BTW, this hooplehead's choice is Outback. There're probably all shite. Chain restaurants be damned.
I always enjoy outback I love the seasoning
I'm surprised they gave Link a knife😂
Good mythical summer starts on my birthday June 3
I've always said outback has the best chain restuarant steak.  It isnt bad at all.  I've actually been let down at "real" steak joints before.  Outback is consistently pretty good.
I work at a roadhouse 🤠
That steak at apples i never got one like that from apple bess
Sizzlers Have Left The Chat! 
Sizzlers are Watching This Video Right Now and crying! 😭
Hmm I didn’t know y’all posted at 3 IN THE FRICKEN MORNING
You didn't do longhorn?
Either Rib-eye or nothing else. Sirloin is a very broad cut when it comes to USDA certification.
So no Waffle House?
Roadhouse is the best hands down
these are good steak takes. also longhorn is an acceptable chain steakhouse.
My favorite is Longhorn steak house
I don't enjoy restaurant steaks as much after getting really good at perfecting cooking a steak at home. If it has enough fat and you cook it on close to full heat in a skillet it gets a smokey flavor like when restaurant steaks are cooked on a grill.
No longhorn because it's too good
what happened to Longhorn Steakhouse??
As an Australian I am personally insulted by Link's Australian accent
Texas roadhouse, Rhett even said, I can added seasoning later.
I think they shoulda tried them without knowing where they were from.
Rhett is not being smart, he might as well order a medium steak cuz he’s not getting the middle cut which will be med rare where as the outside will be medium
How did you guys not include longhorns??
Please do a Little Debbie's Taste Test!
I didn't know Sizzler was still around.  They pretty much all closed down on the east coast, much like Golden Corral is doing now.
4:50 I have a Nanny (my grandma) and an aunt Vicky!😂
Longhorn is the best in my opinion!!
At this time, 1 minute after this uploaded, no one has finished the video yet.
They all looked universally bad!
i wish swine didn't taste so good. miniature pigs are great pets.
Good morning chia Lincoln
Can you guys please make a video about the new season of the NETFLIX SHE-RA cartoon?
I never had a good steak at any Outback.  Way too salty and over seasoned.   Texas Roadhouse all the way.
This guy owes Ryan Fitzpatrick for his look
Ive always thought texas was better now im really considering giving outback another try after this video.
texas roadhouse- order the "dallas filet". you will not be disappointed.
What’s Great Value Bryce Harper doing rating steaks
so excited for more josh
Outback serves microwaved steaks. Nextime you go look on top of building for a vent for the grill hood.
If Rhett and link don't wake up tomorrow it was sizzler poisoning them for dawging their steaks.
(Rhett looks like a cute but very large honeybee)
Honestly, Americans got it good. So many food choices.
how did yall not do longhorn
Pretty sure you guys had your steaks backward on the last 3. Links were consistently pinker than the other on those.
Roadhouse has those bomb ass buns and  Cinnamon butter so that breaks the tie with me
apple bee’s bourbon street steak is the move, not that shoe they made for ya
I’m Australian and have never been to a Outback Steakhouse
"Just ask Gordon Ramsay"... have you ever tried a steak at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant in vegas?
I love a good medium rare steak
What about Houston’s? Or flemmings is a chain steakhouse too.
Just put a steak over the top based on ancient memory... Why taste at all?  ;-)
Why no Longhorn? they are the best to me and their lamb chops are delicious to anyone who wanted to know
STeaks have bones in them . THese are not stakes . Only in the us they are
Texas steak looks very tenderized (poked with lots of tiny blades) to make it tender. outback looks straight forward cooked.
I got a porterhouses from outback
55 pounds of beef for only one year?
the t.g.i. friday’s in the walmart parking lot permanently closed 😪🤘
TASTE MY STEAK
Bruh should’ve been longhorn in there. The best steak there
Australian sizzlers are the best in the world. Hands down
lol Link didnt want to taste his actual medium steak😂
Is Longhorn not a national chain? Because I love Texas Roadhouse and Outback but Longhorn has them both beat hands down.
The word ‘steak’ has lost all meaning
Should’ve done longhorn instead of tgi
I think Texas Roadhouse is better
Sizzler is feeding everyone that tube steak
I am so happy for them,it's funny to see them gag and stuff but sometimes they deserve a break .
4:25 "It doesn't taste like steak, it tastes like a........ MISTAKE" wasted opportunity Rhett. DISAPPOINTED lol
Should have thrown in longhorn steakhouse also lol
so road house for a real one and outback for seasoned one good to know
Roadhouse...  Patrick Swayze
every time link does an australian accent i skip forward 10 seconds ...
There chemistry together is always awkward
11:28 Link’s attempt at an Australian accent is so cute!
D Bags.
Texas road house...
Wow that accent wasn’t even close lol
Longhorn trumps all
Should have had Longhorn
Forgot about Flemming's.
People age their steaks..... I guess a vegan wouldn’t get it lol 😆
You know, I could have guessed that outback and Texas roadhouse would be at the top.
Would have been cool to see prices!
I cried once while eating a Texas road house steak it was so good.
Texas Roadhouse is still better
You could say the stakes 🥩 have never been higher in this competition
I think they actually shot this whole episode in 15 minutes.

Efficiency!
it's already cold... how dishonest.
i'm Aussie and I once went to an Outback Steakhouse in the US. The waiters were all super excited I was there. It was like being a celebrity. Food was good but none of it was anything like Australian food. Except steak of course.
Me trying to enjoy GMM
“Cozy up under your covers...”
Link tries to cut through the plate too
Why you gotta make me crave steak at 6 in the morning? Cant even appreciate this depressing sausage biscuit now.
Why wasn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on there? They would wipe the competition.
They scratched the plates like barbarians owwy
Texas Roadhouse always!!!
I can tell if its cold or hot in the studio

Also i live in texas and saltgrass steak house is AMAZING (in my opion)
No  Longhorn steakhouse or cattle company
This totally should've been a blind taste test
I only like medium rare steak, but I can't eat it anymore. They have to be kosher-fied
well this was MEAThical
Taste my steak! 
I don’t want to... 
You don’t have to. 
          -Friendship
No longhorn steakhouse?
Longhorn is the best
If they had the little fillet from Texas Roadhouse it would have won
I had to dislike this video because Texas road house is the best
Link wants to cut through the plate every time!
Next do blind chicken sandwiches test from fast food places!!
i work at texas roadhouse in tn and  i believe their steaks are some of the best ever totally not because i work there though lol
Male this into a tier lost
Is it just my screen or are they looking orangish-green this episode?
Longhorn has the best steaks for a chain restaurant.
I had steak for the first time in my entire life last week and it was a filet mignon from outback. Pure perfection 👌
texas roadhouse beats the all
Very excited for the Josh series!
Link cracks me up
The best Fast Food steak I have ever had was from an IHOP location that has since closed. It was a really thin T-Bone. It's been 20 years, and I still think about it.
I wish the theme song was, take on me but it was steak on me
Wtf, Sizzler has amazing steaks
Longhorn is better than all this
I love j Peters steaks
I've never heard of the sizzler.
Merger of the Year : Texas Outhouse
Dem rolls tho
Their vids are getting too random
Link’s Australian accent. That’s it. That’s the comment.
55lbs? I can do that in a month without even trying.
May 17th is Minecraft's 10th birthday
"Give it to the dogs." I was rolling.
Should have factored in price point too
If you own a grill, nothing is better than cooking and seasoning your own steaks. Absolutely nothing.
yall needed logans on there too
Today is my birthday 🎂
Longhorns has great steaks
Get your stakes more cooked
I think Rhett, has had a dream about beating up a waiter at an outback.
9:12 Link professes his commitment to the Third Reich while Rhett worries about the future of the show
Is it just me but to Rhett and Link have each other's steak? Rhett has Link's medium and Link has Rhett's medium rare?
The problem with Chili's is embodied right there on the plate, sometimes they do it well sometimes they just don't
Starts at 2:10
S&P the choice for me
Sizzler's steak looks like the tail of florida
Outback Steakhouse has the best steak ever.
Sizzlers from where I come from actually serves good steak.
Watching them enjoying steaks while fasting, why do  I do this to myself?!
BTW Ramadan Kareem mythical beasts!
Texas Roadhouse > all
Red wall in the intro looks like steak
Texas road house is the best. Plus their steak sauce is heavenly
can we go back to the blind tests?
Studying all night for a final this morning. I needed this for a break
Love western sizzlin'
I lost my mind and went to an Applebee's one time, ordered the  steak and hated it! Never going back! There's a Texas Roadhouse down my street that's always crowded, and it's so good. There rolls are unmatched.
They uploaded this on my birthday!
GMM Taster Test Deep Fryer vs Air Fryer
As an Australian, that accent hurt my ears link 😂
have a good mothers day be sure to give your mamas some love and your baby mamas even more love.
Link. Please dont ever do that accent again
All of those steaks looked dry and tough
Why did I decide to watch Rhett and Link eat steak when I'm fasting? 💔
Where is the longhorn steakhouse sirloin?
A great steak shoudn't need more seasoning than salt and peppe, maybe cooked with a bit of garlic
Is nobody going to talk about links Australian accent ahahaha
How did yall not have longhorn steak house
Soooo this is what it feels like watching GMM early in the morninggg
“Taste my steak” lol
Sizzlers fighting the air right now
Our Applebee’s and outback have great steaks, but every time I’ve had one at sizzler it’s full of tough chewy tendon and fat
Please do more blind taste tests!! they are so much more fun
Coming from someone who actually works at sizzler, this is hilarious 😂
Texas Roadhouse hands down.
All of these steaks looked dry - imo
Why wouldn't y'all do a blind taste test? Gives better results =P.
I always refused to go to sizzler. Now I remember why
But you are comparing STEAK houses to non steak specialty restaurants. Should compare steak houses to each other.
Outback steakhouse won... You're welcome
Dang you guys must have had a bad Applebees because the one in my town would never make a steak like that
most of these are not steak houses  lol
i think texas roadhouse is the best but texas roadhouse isnt as many places as all the others, outback should win just based on that
Super excited y'all are giving Josh Saturday videos!!
They have Salt Grass in California?
I've only ever eaten at Applebee's once. The steak tasted like it was seasoned with kerosene. I wasn't a fan.
Anyone know the tune of the steak intro?
I sooo disagree when they’re hot tgi steak is the BOMB
I am pretty sure Link and Rhett's steaks were mixed up the whole time.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT LINK HAVING A KNIFE!?
Going to McDonald’s anyone want anything
I love how this is between 2 steak restaurants and 4 regular bars spots. Why no Longhorn steak house?
Ye its really  hard to find a good steak in the UK... for some reason if you don't  order rare the chef crimates it 😖
Rhett is correct medium rare is the correct way
Are those cold steaks? lol
Idk Texas Roadhouse ambience of peanut shells all over the ground is pretty great
Texas roadhouse is obviously better tho
Is it just me that thinks link sounded like Old Greg with his Aussie attempted accent 😂
I knew before i clicked on this video that texas roadhouse was gonna be the best. Ive tried every steakhouse just about. Roadhouse is the only place ill go for steak
That TGI Friday's in Cary is closed now. Its replacement is also closed.  I guess that nobody liked looking into the garden center of the Walmart.
Yes Rhett, medium rare! This video will be much more useful to me this way

Texas Roadhouse is my go to when I'm craving a good steak, but Outback is also good. If you're torn, decide based on the bread they bring. Amazing rolls? Texas Roadhouse. Warm, fresh loaf of rye bread? Outback
Who dresses you boys?
Only had applebees once in my life and was not impressed. Food was just meh.
Considering they’re from the south I wish Longhorn’s would’ve been included in this lineup.......
Ends 2 days after my birthday
Best steaks and croutons?!? I just want you guys to know how much I appreciate how you so regularly tackle the major issues that I truly care about the most.
Wonder if you got the steak me home tonight idea from the show happy endings.
This makes my stomach hurts who df eats a Applebee’s steak and sizzlers steak?🤮
Outback has the best steaks idgaf Victoria’s Filet is the best one, my boys Rhett and link know what steak is.
i dont know what this accent is even supposed to be but i love it. i'll probably come back just to listen to it again lol
I like the steak better at outback but the sides better at roadhouse 🤪
The screech of the knife on the plate at 7:01 was pretty unbearable.
its almost 3am and now i want steak god damnit
You really missed a good pun with Wayg-EW
Should have removed the labels. The blind ones are the best.
Have not had a good experience with Sizzler. Walked in to submit my application and they said they would call me for an interview and I NEVER heard back from them. It's like every date I have ever been on
The song card was probably the best one yet lol
My mouth is watering after the Texas Roadhouse
Outback and Texas Roadhouse both have god bread but I’m leaning towards TR bread
9:10 eeeeasy there link
Funny, because I called Outback before I started watching.  The make a damn fine steak.
The song was awesome
5:13 that's what she said
Good morning y’all 😋 where’s before notification squad
Texas road house
Are people just afraid to admit when a restaurant is from Texas? AKA, Chili’s 😊
If you guys had included Saltgrass, it would’ve won.
They need Gordan Ramsey on this show
@link, sorry brotha. That TGI Fridays in Cary next to Walmart is perma-closed.
Applebees steak is not even edible.
I've been watching YouTube since like '07 I have never been jealous of the people I'm watching to the point that I'm angry! until right now.
You forgot about Ruth's Chris Steakhouse
applebees only uses Select quality beef...sad
Wait... Link had a knife!
How come you didn’t include Longhorn steak house?
That accent :D :D
Next season for intros you would go back to old school ways
Yes Texas! We have both Texas Roadhouse and Outback. 😋😁
They should have asked for medium rare or rare.. those look over done
outback is kinda trash over priced also
Thank god ltat is ending
Longhorn is the best!!!!
I haven't watched yet, but let's hope they don't make a MisSteak with their choice 😁
Why is their food videos the most popular lmao
For somebody that’s worked at Texas Roadhouse I am not nessiceserily a fan of their food the way it’s done and prepared
Lamp post
Why not do this blind wtf? knowing ahead of time where it comes from is going ti bias them based on their prior conceptions
Blind Texas Roadhouse would’ve won it’s no debate Texas Roadhouse has the best steaks
10:40 PAUSE! Who y’all think gonna have the best steaks??? Anyone other than Texas?? Pfft. We got the steaks on display boy! Ain’t no one know more about BBQ or grillin steaks than Texas! Especially at a Texas road House.
Does Link realize how bad his accent is? I don't think he does.
Just realizing after 21 years of life that Sizzler is NOT Western Sizzlin.  Mind blown
All about Longhorn Steakhouse here in FL from me. It is a chain
Ruby Tuesday's has the best steak
beware, vegans!
those categories are the best yet
I will miss my daily GMM but HOLY COW CANT WAIT FOR JOSH’S SERIES!!!!!
6:25 Love how so far they have gotten progressively more well done 😕😕
Buy papa murphy's stock instead of the public companies said they are too expensive when companies 10 dollars more for utahns and other big family states
Texas Roadhouse actually started in Indiana lol I eat at the first one frequently
It would have been more tender and taste better if you didn’t get it to go and next time ask for extra seasoning
Saturdays with Mythical Chef Josh?! I can’t wait to not watch that!
Don’t know how people can go vegan when steak exists
I'd like to know how many Aussies did Link offend in this video lol
So no one's ever had Ruth's Chris?
Those steaks gotta be cold af
Literally none of these steaks were aged
Don't understand how Sizzler was even a thought to be in this test. Sizzler= a step above Dennys...it's that kind of place. Also, I'm almost positive you got NY strip from sizzler.
So Link CAN use a knife!
I love sizzler steak lol I haven't had it in years tho
I can see the challenge between Outback and Texas, but I give Texas Roadhouse the edge because their steak itself is better.  The other chains don't even belong in a steak taste test.  Applebees looks and tastes like it's a microwaved frozen steak that they throw on the grill just to char up a little bit.
OH MY GODS SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS WHAT WESTERN SIZZLIN IS AND HOW ITS NOT SIZZLER!!!
good time to take a break , have my exams next week until 14th june so i wont be able to watch GMM anyway.
They all looked rank
So these are cold?
I had the sirloin at TGI Friday's before and it was so tough and chewy I could barely eat it, So disappointing.
Link, please don't ever do an Australian accent again 😂🤣😂🤣
Kind regards
Every Australian
When I think of TGI Fridays, I think of burgers, not steaks.  Feels like only two of those options are actual "steakhouses"
Texas Roadhouse all the wayyyyyyy
This video has a weird vibe to it? Anyone else get that too or just me?
Its funny how after the first steak rhett got all the medium steaks which link wanted n link got medium rare which rhett wanted
Whoa, Sizzler's still exist?!
I work at outback and they do have some very good steaks
No Longhorn? I guess California doesn't have a Longhorn, then?
Ruby Tuesdays has amazing steaks too
Wow, all that steak and not one from Longhorn? That would of been a great contestant!
Road house is the best,,
None of those steaks are medium rare just saying...
Should have gotten some Longhorn steaks
Good mythical morning beasts enjoy your day, first like lol
I honestly think Rhett wanted to choose Texas RoadHouse as the best, but wanted to include Link's opinion even though he gave the choice to him. Which is why he chose Outback.
11:53 was that a joke?!?!?!?
yall should do will it blooming  onion
Longhorn is better
（✿ ͡◕ ᴗ◕)つ━━✫・*。Good Mythical Morning
LONGHORN???
Texas roadhouse is the best
Nobody:
Wtf is wrong with your guy’s Applebee’s my Steak has never looked like that
Link was extra Link-y in this episode
“Taste my steak!”

“I don’t want to.”

“You don’t have to.”
GMM Summer starts on my birthday!! 😁
I thought sizzler was only in Australia
i didnt go to any of those restaurants before
The title of the games being sung are literally the BEST! 🎶 Steak 🥩 me home 🏡 tonight !! 🎶
Yet another reason why I like Charlie’s. Yes, it isn’t a chain (thank a theoretical deity for that one) but I don’t care about that. The steaks are great the atmosphere is great and the sides are great and it is a quintessential New Orleans steakhouse that’s been around since 1932.
Good Mythical Summer starts on my birthday
ive never actually been to outback, close to going once, it was packed, must be worth it for the steak!
Link has a knife?
The TGI Friday's in Cary that was mentioned also had a Sweet Tomatoes up from it. Best food ever.
wow they finaly let lynk touch sharp knives
I don't think anyone would like a steak from the Outhouse...
Too bad. Fourwinds has the best steak I've tasted. But pricey, but damn if it wasn't worth it.
Texas roadhouse is better
No Logan’s ? Gulp.
Bring back the mythical morning rooster dragon thing!
Please don't try to do an Australian accent ever again because I just had a mental breakdown
Am I the only one still dying two years later at 12:31 ? 💀
RT Steakoff didn't happen last night, GMM episode is about steak.

Hmmm...
Why is Longhorn not on here or Ocharleys lol both are my go to for good steak at affordable rate.
10:06 that is such a Squidward laugh
Rhett’s response was the manliest answer I’ve ever heard 11:42
I think for the price vs quality it’s Texas road house. But they aren’t anything to write home about.
Link: I am going to take a bite from the mid...dle


Me: Good save Link good save
What happen to longhorn steakhouse
i just noticed the models for the Good Mythical Store :). Those be some sexy ass models! ROCK ON!
You think a broiled steak from sizzler steakhouse would be edible at the very least. How are they still in business for so many years?

When you asked for a sirloin and they did not know....I am sure their management is cringing.
What.. no Longhorn? Longhorn steaks destroys Outback.
Believe it or not, I've ordered steak from Red Lobster and it was great. I actually like it better than Texas Roadhouse. Medium Rare, of course.
Yo Rhett, wheres ur sweatshirt from ?
Can yall rank chicken nugget frozen brands??
Getting take away steak will change the steak because the steam from the steak in a box will cook it and toughen it up
Longhorns!!..
Where's longhorn?!!!
So the best steak came from the only steakhouse U sampled... what a surprise. That kinda like putting a pro athlete up against a regular person and being surprised the pro won.
Road house is better!
No Longhorn?   Not a real contest.
You guys didn’t put Longhorn on here because it would’ve been number one at the start. #PrairieDust
why are you eating them cold
I love how Rhett thinks some of the steaks are “aged”.
Y’all should give chad some of the steak
wait is Logans Steakhouse not a national chain? Just a midwestern thing?? Also who is Logan
Man, I love Outback. It’s been my favorite steak place for years, and my brother just got a job there. Family discounts baby!

I wouldn’t have been upset if it had lost to Texas Roadhouse, but if anything else had won, I’d be burning these guys at the steak. (ha ha....ahh, I slay me.)
Them steaks look brutal.
Longhorn > Outback
Every Australian was just offended by links accent like seriously
Outhouse has the best steak !
I work at Texas Roadhouse, I've still never had the steak.

I do get the Salmon, though.
very excited to see what the new seires with josh is going to be!
Texas Roadhouse >>>>>>
texas roadhouse shoulda won and you know it....
Personally I eat my steaks well done, a contoversial stance.😉 But that aside, this cracked me up:
Rhett:"I'm taking mine  medium rare because it is the correct way to do it."
Link:"Mine is medium  because um,I don't care about your opinion."
Texas yall!
I'm looking for the comments saying one of the steaks is either too overcooked or too undercooked.
my birthday is near
I know it was a sirloin only contest, but you don't know bad chain restaurant steak until you've ordered Denny's T-Bone at 3 in the morning (sober).
Aren't the names supposed to be hidden while tasting?
Outback over Roadhouse..... Nope.
Longhorn?
5:15, that's what she said!!!!!!!!
No Logan’s or Longhorns?
No Holy cow?
Proud to say that the first ever Texas Roadhouse is only a few miles away from where i live.
Link thinks Culver City is in San Francisco apparently. Might need a quick tutorial that the Southern  in Southern California is a geographical reference. He's still the closest thing to George Clooney of YouTube.
Ill make a better steak than all those places
I feel like this was just an excuse to eat steak
(P.s that T.G.I Friday isn’t there anymore it closed)
lol
5:45 That steak looks so bad! Not only is it very weirdly shaped but it's not even close to being medium rare
Soooo, no saltgrass?
Eh Anybody fasting? No?
They better make a video doing a blind taste test next time, and then refer back to these clips as a comical purpose.
i saw the two favorites were both more tender cutting .. yet dry as fffff...  seasoning is key. but why eat a dry steak... you just dont do it
I’m guessing all steaks were eaten cold
U really need to try bob evans sirloin steak....
Bring back " As you can see we can't  " with the blindfolds
After watching this i want some steak..
I'm from Kentucky and the texas roadhouse headquarters is here and it was created here but I agree outback is the best
As an Aussie who's been to Outback Steakhouse, I can honestly say that the only Australian thing about it is its name.
this seems to be a case of sirloin/top sirloin/sirloin tip cause they make a huge difference
Bloody oth
Rare is the best way to eat steaks. And I love Wood Ranch for a steak the most. I don't really even mess with these other places for steak, they're just too bad.
I think I wouldn't be ashamed to go to a Cinnamon's.
Watch the ineraction at about 7:35 and tell me that they aren't becoming old men right in front of our eyes
Roadhouse definitely has better Ribeye, then longhorn, then outback.
Fkin chad
Texas Roadhouse is good half the time the other time something is wrong
They should follow this up with the best restaurant bread
Ive gone to Logan’s for my birthday for the past 4 years and it’s my favorite steak place
Why am I watching this while fasting 🤣
Longhorns > Logans > Roadhouse > Outback as far as chains go, imo
In terms of a chain restaurant The Keg is the place to go in Canada for a good steak.  No other chain would even come close.
A good steak doesnt need any seasoning.
We have handcut steaks at Roadhouse no other low end steak house compares
Rhett & Link shouldn’t know the names of the restaurants where the items come from. Knowing that affects the judgment.
You should have added longhorn steakhouse
Link stahp
Maybe Rhett got fajita steak from chili’s lol
Lonestar?
Wish you all included Longhorn, but I agree Outback and Texas Roadhouse make a good steak for a chain restaurant.
I’m just glad they made it medium and medium rare... I would have been VERY disappointed if they made it any type of done or well done
Should have put the best steak place on there longhorn you cant fake steak lol
Now try the same thing with Country Fried Chicken.
Sizzler's waiter should be shamed for not knowing what is a sirloin.
Two reasons to go to Texas Roadhouse: their amazing rolls with cinnamon butter, and steak!!
Is anyone not gonna talk about how Link used a knife and got away with it?
Ruth Chris is a chain right?
No Saltgrass?
Very much looking forward to Josh's new summer series!!
I thought the title said chainsaw steak test 🥩 🤣
No Longhorn?
Wrong decision! Roadhouse is way better.
Should have cooked a proper steak from a premium butcher and compared them.
Ruth’s Chris has the best steaks!
Longhorn 😡
What brand of sweatshirt is Rhett wearing?
Please, please don't ever try to do an Australian accent!!!😂
To be honest these steaks look sad.
I actually don't like the seasoning at Outback, but I do enjoy Texas Roadhouse's steaks.
Applebee's and Chili's are the same
Where's longhorn steakhouse?
You should’ve thrown longhorn in there, best steaks from a chain in my opinion
no salt grass??
Honestly they all look bad
But isn't Texas just America's Australia
No Saltgrass?
Rhett: ''The steak has a metallic taste to it''.


Bruh, that steak is at least 40% alive; it's gotta pump somethin'
BUT which bloomin onion is better? Roadhouse or Outback 🤷🏼‍♀️
Which steak chain stakes a claim?
you guys need to get better cameras
Rhett please tell me where you got that hoodie!
Salt, pepper, garlic powder and 30 minutes of your time is all you need for an amazing steak
Очень хочется мяса!
I ate a Ribeye steak from Texas Roadhouse last night, soooooo good
We are some beefy mfers
Longhorn easily beats all of these, and is even better than many fancier steakhouses in my opinion.
Josh got his own series, eh? Sweet! Congrats dude. You earned it.
Outback steaks are seasoned meatballs while Texas Roadhouse steaks are juicy tender monsters.
longhorn?
What about Longhorn?
I would love to see something like this, only where they don’t know where the steak is from until they are ranked
This is my 10th episode im going on a GMM MARATHON!!🤘🏼😝
Y’all wouldn’t get to have outback if Paul Hogan didn’t do crocodile Dundee. Thank the Aussies. Even though we don’t even eat steak that much we like chops and snags
Achieving brownie points? You wrong, nasty man.
Angody here listen to earbiscuts like if you do
Can we find the best country fried steak next?
June 3rd is the day I graduate! That should be easy enough to remember. We’ll miss you! ❤️
Rhett looks like he needs some sleep
Gordon Ramsey entered the chat
Just saying that there’s probably no way any of those steaks were “aged”.
Please stop Link
Why didn't you guys blind this taste test?
9:13 where is WSJ now.
I just watched people eat steaks for 15 minutes
Do GIANT foods
Link gives in to Rhett every freakin time
Where do you find the gmm full episodes?
Why go to Apple bees when i have a microwave at home?
Have you guys ever tried timber lodge steak house?
I need to r/whooosh somebody
Im from texas and outback & Roadhouse its hard for me to pick one over the other 😍
Braxtyn is bad at fortnite
Where is longhorns
yeah that is why you don't get steak at sizzler
Longhorns
It's 3:05 AM in the morning my eye's are peeled
U forgot Chipotle
Now I want to eat steak.
Texas Roadhouse is not aged steak
Longhorn >
I think Chili's is the best chain steak around here, ours has had better steaks than the longhorn's in our town. It probably just depends on your local chef's and such.
When Link was doing his Australian accent I thought he sounded like the one of the vultures from the Jungle Book.
All those steaks look veeery dry
Good morning to the people who are up this early!
I didn't even know Sizzler was still around lol the one next to me was closed in the early 2000s :( I loved that place.
Please no more LTAT next season. That’s what Ear Biscuits is for.
My favorite now and always is Chili's!! 🌶️
No Longhorn?
Wish you guys had Longhorns as well they definatley make the best steaks
No Longhorn?
Local restaurants typically have even better steaks than the chains in my experience
No joke, like 20 years ago my mom took me and my brothers to sizzlers and there were bugs in our food crawling across our plate. I have never eaten there since.
What.
was.
that.
aussie.
accent?
(Sincerely, an Australian)
“An average American eats 55 pounds of beef in a year” Oh, could’ve sworn I ate more.
No offence, I love all of your vids but I just don't like this vid...
At 7:00 link decided to destroy half of their viewers who decided to wear headphones
The best steak I ever had was a NY Strip grilled over Kingsford charcoal and not seasoned with anything.  My conclusion is that if you need to season your steak, you are just trying to make a lesser steak into a better one.
Yea shouldn’t have told them where it was from
Using bread knives?
FIRDAY, MAY 17 IS MINECRAFT’S 10 YEAR BIRTHDAY
Outback’s steak is the only one that looks edible.
i fffffuckig love ateal
Love you guys and your videos keep up the great work 😊👍
Steak me home tonight
No Longhorn??? 😢
Longhorn and Logan’s are both better when it comes to steak
So many taste test
Links Australian accent is almost offensive
If Link would have touched Retth's steak with his fingers, he would have been mad
Why do they both use utencils like people who have no idea how to use utencils?
Take a shot every time they say mythical
Steak me home tonight was terrific.
I agree, Outback steak is my favorite with Texas roadhouse being a close second. 😊
The fake aussie accent made me dislike this video but nice video.
They should’ve ate it raw
I’m an onion!!!!
Longhorn?
You should have had Gordon Ramsay on the show. There would be so.much censorship
Applebees taste like a hamburger made without ground beef
They need some Heinz 57 on there
Lmao 7:32
Next get Gordon Ramsay to do this w/ u!
Roadhouse!
That TGIF's doesn't exist anymore. They turned it into like a Cary town family restaurant or something.
I demand a mythical chef camera lol I wanna watch him cook
What happened to Longhorn? They have great steaks
Wait hold up where’s longhorn steak house???
They not have Longhorn over there?
" you should do the commercials, because the guy that does them is obviously not Australian." Rekt
STEAK ME HOME TONIGHT
Dam and I work at applebees ima show my manager this lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Sizzler I go to has surprisingly exceptional steak. I think it really matters which one you go to. I actually like Sizzler steak way more than Outback's, but that only speaks to the quality at each restaurant at any given time.
As far as steaks go: Longhorn > t.roadhouse > outback
Get something else at the other restaurants...
The Sizzler steak does not look like that where I live
Longhorn?
Don't do what I did and get steak from Waffle House at 2:00 AM.
How many sides do you need from sizzler to be full?
howww are you gonna do this without longhorn
they should redo this blind...idk why they didn't do that the first time
Outback has the best steak
I guess I'll be back on YouTube in 2 weeks.
Rhett you chose wrong, Texas road house is superior my guy
You guys should try chain restaurant salmon dishes.
Saltgrass steakhouse is superior
That end bit reminds me that I've never had a Bloomin' Onion. And I feel deprived.
Y'all not have Branns on the west coast?
I used to call my step dad my fake daddy because people would call my bio dad my real dad. But when I got older my step dad just became my dad. So when referring to both of them it was my second dad and my bio dad....made people think my parents were two gay father's lol
Best steak I've had was at longhorns.  That texas tea tho 🤤🤤🤤
Gross.  What part of the human body is "steak" even made in?
I feel like all of these are excuses for them to eat
PUT ME ON PLZ
Need to try logans roadhouse
7:00 Links steak from Chili’s was so undercooked lmao I’m surprised he ate it
Where's Longhorn?
I like sizzler steaks not more than outback but not bad
“Steak Me Home Tonight” 

Nothing but ‘Happy Endings’ there
The st(e)akes could not be higher
outhouse steakback
T....Roadhouse is better.     Believe me.
Use me as a “they should do every taste test blind” button.
this is accurate but texas roadhouse wins every time in my book
Why did Outback stop putting the little pea pods on their steaks? They were so good! I stopped eating there after going to Texas Roadhouse. Their steaks are phenomenal!
What about Longhorns steak house
TGIs in the UK is nowhere near that bad around where I live, the steaks are actually pretty good. The bottom 4 steaks are an embarrassment.
You guys need to do some Canadian brands ..
Sad that longhorn wasn’t included but I enjoyed the episode regardless!
What about mcdonalds?
There’s a lot at stake here!
Why didn't Link try Rhetts steak???? Also, didn't it seem like they wanted the episode to end? I swear I can feel when there's tension.or maybe I'm insane cause it's 2am
I really wouldn’t eat any of those lol
TASTE TEST ARE THE BEST EPISODES!!!!, change my mind.
U guys don't Kno steaks at all
Vegans have left the chat.
Applebee’s = leather steak
3:40 😂
I just watched 14 min of people eating steak in front of me
Not a vegetarian or anything like that, but how am I 30 years old and I've never had a steak lol and why am I watching a video on steak taste tests 😂happy Wednesday!
They should rank the foods and do a blind taste test at the same time blind taste tests are the best  !
Dont trust their palate. Dont know what good food is. But i do agree with how bad Sizzler steaks are
In my city we had an Outback that turned into a Texas Roadhouse. Lol
While I was watching the Video , I was smelling The Stakes 🙂
They gave Link a knife...
I remember going to Sizzler and they had these window where you could choose your deserts and other things. You opened the window and when you took your desert it rotated around replacing the desert
The true fight for the steak places is always with what you get to go with the steak. I prefer texas roadhouse, but that's because our outback closed by my house. Honestly, the texas roadhouse steaks can tend to be far better seasoned than outback, where they have a tendency to over-season the steaks. (I've tested this though 10 texas roadhouses in 4 states, and 15 outbacks in 6 states.) Outback can have some amazing sides to go with the meal, but I've found that the rice from texas roadhouse goes near perfectly with their steaks.
Outback will always be number 1 in steak
Next would be Longhorn steakhouse and orlando alehouse
Me: Bet you can't think of pun for today's episode


Also Me: You are sorely mis-steak-en
Those are all trash steak
Anyone who orders their steak medium well or well done should be ashamed and banished from ever eating steak. If I wanted to eat a leather shoe, I would just eat that. Medium rare or rare are the only acceptable temperature. Fight me lol
Why wont link call him his step dad what's with that
Longhorn
For the love of gollywobbles link no dont do the Australian accent please
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BLIND TASTE TESTS??? Links opinion can’t be trusted without a blind fold
Wait Sizzlers is still a thing
Sizzler & Fridays.........I wish...
Help me with this one: Angus Barn vs Ruth’s Chris? Rhett, Link what are your thoughts?
10:46 ahaha I love links impression of a Texan 

Also where is Saltgrass that place is AMAZING
Why is Ruth's Chris Steakhouse not one of these...
Logans is better to me than Outback
I am surprised Logan's Roadhouse and Longhorn steakhouse aren't contenders. Lucky's steakhouse is my favorite, but that's not a chain as far as I know.
Texas whorehouse
This video makes me want to invest in a George Foreman grill for some reason lol
I was the millionth viewer.
But like where even is Longhorn???
Yeah that aussie accent got old after like the first time and a half
vegetarians left the chat
What about Longhorn steak house? The best chain steak!
Pale colored beef is usually an indicator that its been frozen at one point.. usually..
I have said outhouse before😁😁😁😀😀
Walmart doesn't even have greeters anymore. I wanted to be one when I was a kid.
First time I've actually watched one of these in the morning in months
Sizzler just let me down. Damn budget steaks are only good fresh I guess
As far as chain restaurant steaks, Texas Roadhouse is in a league of its own.
My trash of an ex girlfriend worked at texas roadhouse and now I work part time at outback and I can safely say we have the better steaks
What is sizzler
u said u dont need to go to australia but who dosent want to come her come on hahah
So what's a good way to start the day you ask? well watch 2 guys eat Steak of course
do steaks just not look good on TV?
Steaks are aged???
Who doesn't like a good steak🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩🥩😍😍😚☺😚😊😂😭😢😭😢🤤😱😨🤯🤯
It’s 11:00am, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, MYTHICAL BEASTS. HAPPINESS.
First time disliking their video over their choices
Laughs in Texan
Me: Have you ever tried SaltGrass?
Texas Roadhouse hands down.
GMM tries steaks from chain restaurants, outback gets the best.

Ruth Chris: Am I a joke to you?
There are no Longhorn Steakhouses in L.A.
#5 on trending. Good job 🥳
You should've got Gordon Ramsay as a guest here.
I laughed so much 😂
All steak is good!
it shouldve been a blind taste test
Fridays all day
Where's longhorn steakhouse?
“Give it to the dogs” 😂😂😂
Who else is watching the morning show on their bed at night?
I think after the first steak, all the next plates are mixed up and the medium rare are on Links side. 😂😂😂😂
I-I need my Good Mythical Summer.. slow screeching intensifies
9:13
No steak and shake?
Red Lobster
There should be any seasoning on a steak. If anything just a little bit of salt and pepper as a slight marinade. Steak shouldn’t need any help to taste good
uh.....why was this not a blind test?
Longhorn steakhouse has the best steaks in town!
Loved that steak song intro lol. I always thought the steaks at Applebees were great
Shoutout to Cary, NC!
Congrats on #5 in trending
I don't know if they still do it, but Outback cooks their steak on a flat top and uses the grill only on fish.
How many times did they say mythical in the intro
some of link's steaks were medium rare and he liked em lol
7:00 MY EARSSS
Chilis definitely
You guys should of tried tube steak as well my girl says its delicious.
Taste test the breads
You should have tried longhorn steakhouse, that's the best one
Not a fan of grill marks. I like that even sear on Chilis and Outback steak.
Mmmmmmm... The delicious Tube Steak from Sizzler. 🍆🙏🤷‍♂️
I like Rhett's hair
Let's make 1 steak 2 steaks.. why was that so hilarious?
should've reviewed longhorn, they're better than outback. albeit more expensive.
🗿
They let Link use a knife...
As an Aussie, I am here to say to Link: Please don't try our accent ever again.
Don’t need to go finish watching this video. Texas Roadhouse is the winner hands down! Their rolls are amazing.
OMG I'M SO EXCITED FOR ANYTHING STARRING JOSH.
Outback is best steak where I live
Nooooo I literally live for ltat
You guys should have done longhorn it’s my favorite
Ahhh I live in Cary and I’ve been to that Applebee’s!! (I didn’t get a steak)
Twitch.tv/tiredcast
Good Mythical Summer is AMAZING !  It makes me feel Alive and Young again .
Applebee’s steam cooks their steaks not grill and come with grill marks in the package
my dads friend owns texas roadhouse, imma ask if they knew they were on this video.
This is improper. Today is Roast Leg of Lamb Day.
NOOOOO MY BIRTHDAY MAY 17 2019 FRIDAY 😭
I eat my steak still mooing I don’t do medium rare
Dang I'm going to miss LTAT but I'm so excited for Josh's videos
the metallic taste you had was actually blood . don't believe me?go to a doctor get your own blood taste it it will taste like metal.and I'm a pure Vegetarian:)
moral of this video, never go to a chain restaurant for steak
Great now I have a hankering for steak, thanks GMM 😊
can someone tell link to never do an australian accent ever again please
peta boutta shut this down
gay
I think Rhett kept getting the medium and Link got the med rare one everytime.
I work at Texas Roadhouse, fair choices but I would like to say we both sear and grill our steaks
you guys are always on trending haha! love it lmao
yikes, that aussie accent was bloody butchered lol, good try tho
Anybody remember Bugaboo Creek??
No sizzler in upstate ny
Link's impression was a spot on J.F.K. lol not Australian.
1st, if they don't serve a filet, they shouldn't have been considered.  2nd, where's Longhorn?
Eat, drink, I have clothes：cloudstyle
Why the heck was longhorn excluded?
No Ruth Cris'?  No Firebirds?
All tastes bad af specially Chili’s and outback it’s somewhat k but so expensive don’t try it guys they’re bad af or maybe it’s bcuz I’m used to good food af such as NonGMO organic kosher etc so don’t try those restaurants that they mention or show
Sizzlers hands down
I guess there are no Longhorn restaurants in California?
Watching this as I’m about to break my fast😂
mythical chef Josh needs his own cooking show
Links Australian accent hurt my ears 😂 leave the accents to us Australians
These steaks are rock hard
ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه هههههههههههههههه
خخخخخخخخخخ
you guys really just ate all my kids on camera
Lando shares his expertise on our Mythical Slimes! https://bit.ly/2Vju2nZ
how many age-old questions are there?
You know there's this other kind of Pizza slime. It's called dough
Still waiting for "Will it Juice" and see them juice a beetle
I watched 2 middle aged men make slime for 15 minutes...

No regrets
Link: “What’s up slimers! does a peace sign
Me: no dad..😂
Rhett and Link: make their own food
Josh: am I a joke to you
"Your such a over-a-chesser"
that's the chessiest pun yet



Wait
"Do your mouth lubing on your own time" Rhett - 2019
YOU REALLY DIDN'T TRY CONGEALED PIGS BLOOD SLIME?? I'M SO DISSAPOINTED
Link: It gives you something to do while waiting people to drown..
Rhett: that's very satisfying





Me: yes, yes it is satisfying to wait for people to drown...
Rhett and Link are the only people that can actually make me watch a slime video
Will it TOILET PAPER!!! 




Options:
Paper towels
Cardboard
Tree leaves
Sandpaper
A Tortilla
Heck, A Pancake!!
"Will I be able to survive the week on my 10$ bank account" should be the next new segment
I thought for sure the “senior citizen slime” would have prune juice 😂
Flint lockwood: i present to you SPRAY ON SHOES!
I’m surprised “overacheeser” wasnt Rhett’s nickname in Highschool.
Do the idubbz fast food ranking challenge you guys are over qualified
! Did you check beforehand to see if there would be a reaction between the Borax and the Windex? Chemicals, man.
/Linkdiesofcyanidegaspoisoning
Did anyone else want to see them cook the slime pizza and then taste it?
Am I the only one who thinks of star wars every time Link’s son’s name is said??

Lando Calrissian
Link: We're coming to play live in your area
Me, a European: so that was a f-ing lie
3:57 Rhett- (laughing) "I said texniques"
Link- doesn't care and ignores him
How to make edible slime: 
Step 1: melt candy
Step 2: put corn starch in melted candy
Step 3: mix it together 
Step 4: eat it
I can testify, once you wear a pair of Crocs, it's all you want to wear.
Rhett: Did you wash?!
Link: Wash what?
Rhett: Your hands.
Link: ...no
Rhett: ..yeah me neither.

I love you guys.
Link: I wouldnt call it slime
Will it slime? YES
When link mixed the borax with his hands I was screaming!!
*Rhett "Your such an over a cheeser" man that joke was so cheesy.🤣🤓
Will It Ramen?
Will It Chicken Nugget?
Will It Soda?
Will It IceCube?
Will It Pillow?
Will It Pencil?
Will It Coffee?
“Did you wash your hands?”
“No”
“Me neither”
...proceeds to eat slime.

Brave men.
I remember watching them when they first started I was like 7 and there still going gmm rocks💛🌵
Link: And no we’re not talking about ur favorite Dolan Twin 😂😂😂
Crock's Slime; Slocks

(Everything Nim has entered the chat)
I work at Papa John's and my old General manager used to say to people over cheesing pizzas. You are being an overacheeser and when Rhett said it, it got me
Will it distract me from studying? YES!
That freaking kid at the end "I'm Ben" is so so precious😂💖💖
Link: I wouldn’t necessarily call it slime I would call it Brrb.    





I love this channel
13:02 Link: "feel it, because that's awesome right?" 
Rhett: smiles at his best friend he knows is genuinely excited about it
The fact Link put the borax in without dissolving it in hot water first




EFGWALUIHFOUIWRGF
No slime made from swine blood? Can't say I'm not disappointed.
alternate title: ’Rhett and Link trying to speak for 15 minutes straight’

Me: wearing crocks ... but i'm 14...
Is it me or the croc slime looks like the spray on shoe from Cloudy with a chance of meatballs..
No one: 
Youtubers in their thumbnails:
:0
"It gives you something to do while you wait for people to drown" OH MY GOD
I thought for a second they were going to put a whole ass croc in the slime.
The real question is: will it go viral
13:53 they should make rainbow crocs that say "That is pretty great" on them.
Rhett:  what do senior sidasins like a lot?
Me: SOAP
Rhett and Link: CROCKS!
Me: oh

I LOST IT🤣🤣🤣
Will It Toilet Paper!! LoL

Me: Slime isn’t really super popular anymore

Also me: proceeds to watch
"You know what SLIME it is!!"
You said Birmingham and I got super excited for a second until I remembered there is an american birmingham, so you aren't coming to the uk
"You're such an over-acheeser" put THAT on a t-shirt!
"Chase took this little window from his little house" is the most pure and wholesome imagery in the world

Slime career people who make slime:

7:04 the way his face expression changes so quickly 😂😂
SOMEONE FINALLY IN JACKSONVILLE
The intro should have gone as follows: 
Link- "It's pizza slime!"
Rhett- "Let's talk about that?"
theme music & intro clip play
:Will it Slime?
Lando: hold my pop tart.
ok but why does that sunscreen slime look so yummy
You should make a 'Will it Dog Food?'!! 
You could make dog versions of foods and have them tested by Barbara and ....


Link!!! Heheeh
Link: I'm not talking about the Dolan twin.
Me: okay sureeeee😏
Nobody:

Absolutely no soul:

Link: 
You should do a British/European vs America product test

5 seconds earlier: It's a gel
Do a "will it perfume?"
3:53 - 4:04 was the biggest that's what she said i've heard
Hard time focusing cause we saw you both on camera get a “BROSECTOMY”
I can't believe how much it bothered me how you used your hands to mix!🤣😂😢
"And what do senior citizens love more than anything?" 



Pudd-



 



Oh..
top betrayal of all time:
1/ GMM episode about slime without Lando
was anyone else hoping they said "Today we ask the modern day question"?
The first video I watched from your channel was Will it popsicle?! 3 years ago. I was sick that day and your video made me happy. 

After that I fell in love with your channel. You guys are awesome!
CANADIAN TOUR!!! (and choose Edmonton, not Calgary 🤗)
“Ain’t nobody done slime da way we bout to”
i was expecting Lando to be on this episode since he is the S L I M E  M A S T E R
Karina Garcia should have been in this vid.
11:26 Looks like a huge seagul has dropped a bird doodie on Rhett's nose 😂🙈
"You're such an over-a-cheese-er!!!!" LMAO!!!!
They're is already cleaning slime from the ep testing cyber clean products i also thought this video was great 👍👌🤩
Do your mouth lubing on your own time.  -Rhett, 2019

My reaction:
“Hey, lucid, we got A new video we will do. Will it slime?”

Me: I quit

“But it was sent in by-“

Me: Nope



Rhett and links reaction:
“So someone sent in ‘will it slime’”

Rhett and link: Sure!
They should do 'will it ASMR' 😂
Y'all need to come to Knoxville, TN on one of your next tours!
the whole "slime" thing is really cringy
They should've called the Windex Slime "SlimeX" rather than "WinSlime" IMO...
That Dolan Twins joke made me laugh so hard, I never would've expected that 😂
7:54🤣🤣😂👌🏻
Damn Link, looking good! I love that red shirt/jacket thing! I need!!
Link: Wow there's more in there!
that's what she said
Links face after he said good mythical morning 🤣
You should do a will it chicken nuggets

I still can’t go bc meh momma won’t let me 
0oF
idk why "Rhett's been kneading for 11 hours" was so funny to me
OMG! I suggested this and I'm so happy you listened!!
My Lord. I never thought I would ever find pizza unappealing.... I was wrong.
The  sunscreen one looked satisfying
wait. so, barnacle boy got his look from sunscreen? and... ( who's the other one?)
No. No. NO. There is only one Slimer, and he is a green blobby ghost from the 80s.
2:48 🤦🏽‍♂️ rich people arguments
Creepy.. I was blankly looking at a Windex bottle as they said Windex. I made the sign of the crucifix ASAP.
BHAM, AL is ready for ya! 🙌🏾
We need another slime episode but with them making BLOOD SLIME
"Now We Have Something To Do While We Wait For People To Drown" 😂 💀
"The big one"

Rhett in his head : that was my nickname in high-school
you should do will it edible cookie dough for Link's birthday
Oh yeah I live in Birmingham!!❤️❤️
Link:" And it makes you have something to do when you wait people to drown"

Rhett:"That's satisfying"
ALBUQUERQUE?!?!?!?!!, THANK YOU OH MY GOSH
Link being the rich daddy 
lmao
Omg your coming to Phoenix!!!! STOKED💖
Can you guys have Benedict Cumberbatch on your show? It would be amazing. Love you guys💕
Woah I time traveled into 2016 / 2017!
That "I'm Ben" was so pure, oh my heart. Hahahaha
I thought you were going to say booze slime and make edible slime shots! opportunity missed!
They're right, this question literally is an age old.
The two ingredients together would react too quickly to get a proper mixing of the ingredients, potentially resulting in an unfavorable outcome
Mix it up a little...before you mix it ~ Rhett Mclaughlin 2019
Ooh, nice shirt Link. Lovely shade of red ❤
Rhett and Link slimed Crocs. I've seen it all
“Smells pleasant, and it gives you something to do while your waiting for people to drown.” 
Best line ever.
I’m sorry did Link say he was finding slime all over his “HOUSES” like multiple houses?
I love slime but every time I play with it I get a rash, 😩I think I am allergic to the borax anyways great video👌👍
I love how the into song is subtitled as "groovy electronic music"
The way the little guy said "I'm Ben" made my heart explode! Heheh.
you should do a challenge of who can make the better slime or something
I watched another YouTuber do a pizza slime, totally trendy did it awhile ago looked the same lol
Finally coming to Arizona. Can't wait!!
Everybody should watch this video! I liked them all but the pizza one as fascinating as it was looked gross because you ate it. Great video! 😁👍🍒🍒🍒🍒
Will it meatstick? Good mythical morningggg ❤️
Dat advanced techsniques, I tell ya. 🤣
You guys should come to Utah!!
we need a Will it Rice Krispy Treat?
Watching Lando play with slime made my day
“Because it’s summer!” 
-meanwhile in Canada ☁️🌨⛄️🌨☁️
No I'm NOT talking about one of the Dolan twins

Me: wwwhhhooooowwww I see you damn you really comin after them arent you?
That moment when link went to happy to sad In a instant 😂
Rhett: Did you wash??
Link: No
Rhett: Me neither proceeds to pat the entire slime
Okay so lando's gonna test these slimes but.. the croc one was all over links foot-
I'm a chem major, and in ochem1 we made slime with borax and clear glue. And even learned why lol super cool. Throws well 😂
I will rob you and every thing you love like thanos
Just 2 dads playing with slime😂
Wrong. Senior citizens love werther's originals more than anything. Crocs is second or third.
10:36
KNEADING AWAY

I'm so sorry..
Link have to be family of Ozzy Osbourne.
kurt sutter is so cool
Now I can throw slime at the windows without getting my mom angry lol! 😂😂😂
I just wanted to let you know that I absolutely love you guys at Good Mythical Morning, you can always turn my bad day around! Much love from Ohio ♥️
When Link held up the croc slime it reminded me of an iSpy book cover
I wanna see a will it bacon episode
An over-a-cheeser😂😂
Nooo don't degrade to the children of today! You were one of the good ones!!! 


I'm just kidding you guys are amazing 😃
"You gotta get your mouth lubed up."

  -Link 2019
How many possible will it are there?

Hey, Vsauce Michael here. How do you count past infinity
Link reminds me of Schneider from " one day at a time "😂
Windex Slime

So that’s how slimes are made! #DragonQuest
The one year I'm not in Jacksonville 😑
Polystyrene is the biggest word I’ve heard Link say😂
R&L didn't say it, but i will, Romdhan Mubarak to everyone. ♥
You guys got my hopes up when you said Jacksonville. When you guys coming to NC?
Both Rhett and Linc "I wouldn't call it slime... it's not really slime" 5 seconds later "Will it slime? YES!"
Woke up for suhoor and I also get this treat? Ramadan is going well so far. Happy Ramadan ❤️
11:37 "It smells pleasant, and then it gives you something to do while you're waiting for people to drown."


OwO"
of course i leave tampa when you come 😂
13:18
Listen with your eyes cloesd..
heh.
I've always wondered what was in links cup
Where's the Notification squad at?!
OMG ALBUQURQUE!!!!
You guys really missed your chance with SlimeDex
7:55, the face you make when she says "Pick what you want for dinner", the disagrees with every suggestion.....
you should do floral foam its very satisfying
Did Link just messure 16 oz and pour 8 oz in each bowl instead of measuring 8 oz each?
When they said Jacksonville I screamed
7:4 he does NOT look impressed XD
the prime of this channel was 2013-2016
I am still traumatized by the episode of how you are showering wrong.  Linc, you have issues!
Linky boi is rich. Houses? 6:03
I have a cold 🤧😢
1 like=me slightly getting better.
god link talking about lando melts my heart he such a good dad
Um Jacksonville Fl or Jacksonville Al???
I like the video, just not the subject. Being a student, slime is everywhere.
I LOVE CROCSSSS i got 3 pairs :)
THE LITTLE BOY AT THE END WAS SO CUTE AH MY HEART
Rhett putting on links makeshift shoe
Rhett: “Just... just... just.. Just.... just... jus...”
I felt offended when Link said Rhett is his sidekick. They both run the show equally in my opinion 😂
Rhett and Link have a really talented crew.
YOU GUYS NEED TO COLLAB WITH DOLAN TWINS!!!!!
Let's have will it hummus
I was expecting them to do blood
Or snail slime
I think the Windex slime may have been slightly over activated.......
13:37 It's like that scene in Ghost 😂😂
Could it be true?? GMM coming to ABQ????
!DON'T EAT THIS AT HOME!
5:27
I have been awake since this episode released but I didn't want to watch until I've got into my great mood, which is now, but I swear I can't have enough, literally every second that passes reminds me of how close I am to the end.
Man, I love you guys, I wish I could have more of you.
Much love from the Middle East.
“What are these called? Eyes?” 😂😂
BIRMINGHAM. THEY'RE COMING TO BIRMINGHAM. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
Rhett and Link coming to Albuquerque in November??!? This is the best news I've heard all week.
This might actually be an age old question.
Hey Lando do you wanna play with daddy's foot slime
Love your jacket, Link!!

Everybody forgets about Indiana, WHAT THE HECK GUYSSSS😢😢😢😢

Any other suggestions 😂
Does the Crocs slime remind anyone else of the spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatballs?
I thought you were the sidekick link?
Rhett's tall so he's the leader...



Sorry link. Love yuo <3
i remember looking up how to make slime about 4 years ago and only finding 3 videos, now there’s millions
I've been watching you guys' show (albeit on an older account) for years... Way before yall blew up. It's nice too see fame and fortune didn't take away from the quality of the show. It's still as good as it's been for years!
How about...




Will it time!

- clocks made out of cereal, pizza, crackers, fish, and hot sauce
Holy cow! You guys made trending!
every episode of gmm I watch there's always at least one moment where I sit back and wonder how we all got here, 13:38 is this one's 😂
Age old question WILL IT TOOTHPASTE? It be funny to see what they make.
2:46
cringiness has entered the chat

Has there ever been a 100% "Yes" percentage in Will it history before?
When you coming to KC
Toby McGuire Spider man if he was a youtuber "it's pizza slime"
7:03 - 7:09




Your welcome
YALL SHOULD DO WILL IT TOOTH PASTE. @GMM
3:52 did rhett say n*gga under his breath? xD
Slime! So satisfying that it was even the first "Will It" where everything...um...willed!
Ethan Dolan is my favorite 🤪♥️
Link is especially handsome in that wine red jacket 😍
I love the obvious complement of Rhett in blue ☺
will it waffle? please like so R&L can see!!!
Ngl, I was waiting for the pig blood slime 😅😂
Shoulda used melted cheese for the pizza slime
NO BLOOD SLIME!? C'MON!
As someone who wears crocs everyday, I can tell you that once you put them on they never leave.
I saw y’alls first live show last October at the Raleigh fairgrounds in North Carolina!!! Hope to see another one this year ❤️❤️❤️
Link: ohhh yeah that's nice 


Hahahah
"... waiting for people to drown." "That's satisfying"..... wow lol
I thought this was an old video😂
I literally read what is slime
They should of have invited 
Carina Garcia
you should do more dose it slime!
Anyone remember Oobleck? That stuff was my slime of choice way back in grade school
And no I’m not talking about ur Favorite DOLAN TWIN, lmao I laughed so hard 😹😹😹
Alternately: Slime, will it Croc?
Im  happy for all your success but wowza these episodes recently make me want to hurt myself for watching.


If I ever need to provide a clip of someone faking excitement over something, i'll be back.
RHETT AND LINK ARE FINALLY COMING 💃

y'all think they have a restraining order against me for my puns or should I be ok with buying a ticket?
Okay y’all said Tampa and my heart skipped a beat for a second lol
"Not great as a food stuff" hahaha
So what have we learned with this video? That everything can be slime!
Though they forgot the pigs blood and guts this time
What's wrong with links nail? 🙎‍♂️
As an occupational therapist, I'm very interested by this pizza slime. Very fun sensory experience. Good episode guys.
Omg Ben in the it's time to spin video is literally the cutest thing I ever did see
I want Link to slime
SAENGER THEATRE IN NEW ORLEANS! September can't come soon enough!
I watched the whole video on 0.5x. Painful!
This video was GENIUS
The slime croc kind of reminds me of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (spray on shoes).
Link getting so excited over the “slocks” made my day.
This should've featured Shando :'(
Link you used too much activator!!
They are really bad at making slime. They dont ever pull it or stretch it.
“The internets favorite play thing.. and no I’m not talking about your favorite Dolan twin” AKHEOACDJRJOSNF OMMG!
I swear ro god if you become another slime channel...
Hey you should hire Scott cramer
13:52 .... cloudy with a chance of meatballs? 💀
remake the unicorn rap
I love how they kept over activating the slime lol
will it mochi?? 
will it ramen??
I thought that when they said senior citizens they would be like, “Senior citizens! Will it slime?” And just use pieces of senior citizens
Link said he hates slime, but he sure is having the most fun I've ever seen someone with slime. "See how that feels.. It's AWESOME right?!"
2017 called they want their trend back
Omg Rhett said “warsh” 😂
This was an incredible episode! 😍 I always think y'all are gonna run out of will it ideas, but you always come back with something and prove me wrong 😅😅😅😂😂😂 but seriously this episode was funny!!! 😂
"You can always get a little or if you keep ...... "
Karina Garcia is *shook*
when you're watching your slime vids, but somehow you still see Link's foot.
Hehe Dad at the end had an Attack on Titan beanie ♡
Ever since slime became a popular thing I’ve always wondered when they would do this 😂
Man he got me all excited about the internets favorite playthings...the Dolan Twins 😂😂😂
“Did you WARSH?” AHHHHHHHHHHHH IM DISGUSTEDDDDD
Pizza slime.   In other words pizza dough 😂
You guys are going to be in Albuquerque?!
I live three and a half hours away from there!
If you guys wanted pizza slime you could have just grabbed a slice from the pizza line in my college cafeteria HEY-O
Kurt sutter from sons of anarchy?? What a small world how do they know him lol
Tech sneaks better known a hackers lol
7:03 Link For Some Reason is Mad LOL

Spoilers:




Everything was a yes
I wonder if they got the idea from the Slime anime
#19 on trending street
Guys, when are you coming to Mexico to do a live show?
Its like Flint Lockwood's spray on shoes! Lol
Rhett and Link , y'all should do will it waffle
you guys should do a "Will It Coffee?"
Y’all are thinking of Flint Lockwoods shoes aren’t you
You guys always make me smile I wish I could meet you in real life
Love you guys, I've been waking up early every morning just to watch you guys!
The feeling of cornstarch on your skin is the most cringe inducing thing in the world
I would think just about anything would slime under those perameters.  It's almost like will it liquid lol
Why do you never go to West Virginia ?
Lando is either very proud or very disappointed

14:24 This reminds me of spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
Omg if not even seen the video but soon as it was a notification and saw how many people commented and liked
Still can't beat the popcorn and pizza scented Gak
The real question: Will you like my comment

14:10 Rhett: "You know what? I think we may have gone 4 for 4 today, Link, bec--"
Link: "CROCKS!"

Pls make "Will it Kebab?"

You kind of made some of the slimes wrong but it was still awesome to watch parents try to make their own slime give it their own kind of twist
The 1st ever Will It that Succeeded :D
you should also do a wilt shoe
Windex already has chemicals, so it affected the results.
Epic 



Yes I was early and i just didn’t know what to comment
lol Link mentioned the Dolans
7:06 Link's face is my Monday morning mood
someone is FINALLY coming to NOLA
13:49 And that, my friend, is how spray-on shoes was invented.
Will It Toilet Paper?

Slime is such an old trend now, but the fact that you guys are turning random things into slime makes it new and great again! 😁👍


Rhett: You are such an "overacheeser"

I swear i saw this episode coming
Omg my roots asleep this hasn't happened in 1 year and 18 days
No! I WANNA BE THE SLIMER!
7:05 what happened to Link??
with the sunscreen I thought they would replace the glue in the slime recipe but the corn starch recipe works well.
I just watched 2 grown men play with slime for 15 minutes.... Not even sorry
Doug is the type of guy to....

oh wrong channel
No slime worked what are you talking about!?
Hey, uh... was that slime boiled for safety?
Slimedex would have been better
God that Windex looks so blue...I'd love a glass of it
everything about it makes me vom especially the part when they admitted they didnt wash their hands...
I heard using clear glue makes the slime stickier
I wish my parents would let me get tickets, please do a show in Arizona please.
LOVE the outfits guys 😜♥️☝️
5:32 man, cook it first :D
5 views 100 likes good one youtube!

Link's actual first name is Charles
Is will it guacamole ever coming?
The slime crock looking like the spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance
Those are my slocks!!
Link: you use borax, glue,baking soda and other ingredients 
Me: clears throat I did it as glue,borax & water.💭
Others: there is other ingredients in slime.       🤔
9:50 what was that Rhett? 😂😂😂
0:46 😂😂😂 I’m dedddddd
Wait what do they even do at there shows do they just talk l or what
I nearly screeched when link added all the borax to the windex slime (its 5am here)
Has science gone too far??
Has science gone too far??
You are welcome 11:00
You should make a new channel called: Good Mythical Night (I guess you would do stuff at night or something)
Notifications squad!
I live for the will it's 😍
The wheel is gonna land on win face for sure
Rhett needs to be a dlc character in the new NBA 2k lol
You shouldn't touch Borax with your bare hands. It's extremely abrasive to the skin. You can get chemical burns from it.
Lol what if the windex and borax had a chemical reaction resulting in explosion
2:44 disaster time :D
All the slime connoisseurs are shaking
As an Italian I can say that the slime pizza is a very good idea
Why haven't we thought about it yet?
anyone have the link for link's jacket? as great as it looks on him, I think it would look amazing on me
5th viewer❤️❤️
Windex would of worked better had you slowly added the borax solution. You only need a small amount into the glue/water. Mix a tablespoon amount in and it will be slime or keep adding small amounts until it is
Totally trendy did it first
5:31 this reminds me of a very specific video with a single cup
The croc slime looks like the spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatballs 😂
I it bed? Will it pillow? Will it survival kit? Will I go to sleep?
U should do will it toothpaste
YES I’ve been waiting for this video for waaay too long :P
7:10 I wanted the smaller bowl to be used to scrape the glue from the other bowl 😫
Yall should have the dolan twins on your channel for an episode!
The thing is Rhett prob has a vacation home😂
The croc slime shoes they made looked like the spray on shoes Flint made in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs
SPRAY-ON SHOES!
Anyone else think Link's humor has just gotten more bitter and dark? Not complaining 😂😂
So.... when will Rhett and Link come to Dallas, TX tho
Where is the early squad??
They made Flint Lockwoods shoes
Totally trendy did the pizza slime.
My favorite dolan twin is Dolan Dark
Never to Seattle tho

Rhett said dooty... I'm mature
slocks look like the shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
How do you live with yourselves?
Do a Will it smith with guest host Will Smith
Rhett looks old 
that makes me sad
Surprised that "The Big One" wasn't Rhett's nickname in highschool.
I am deeply offended that they cut up crocs.....
I'm a very tactile person, so I completely understand Link's enjoyment of the feel of the slime.
This is why i continue to watch GMM.

Will it Jacket?
There should be a chocolate milk blind taste test.
“It smells pleasant and then it gives you something to do while you’re waiting for someone to drown” -Link 2019
Do you guys ever think about getting a TV show?
Rhett looks like a tired boi
I bet it taste good tho
If anyone, you Link, are Rhetts sidekick.
Will it oobleck?
Link: “Today is about the internets favourite play thing”
Also Link: “and no I’m not talking about your favourite Dolan twin”
Hi my name is esme too
Does their mug has a water?? Or it's just a display lol
15:53 is the end of the vid
I was hoping for: Pigs blood, will it slime?
Nice jacket.
Will It Smile? :)
Did i totally miss the pizza slime?
Yes slime!!! My 4 daughters are obsessed with slime!!!
Do will it taste...lol can’t think of anything else
For everyone who watches the Dolan Twins:
Which lane are you in?


Like: Ethan (lol i'm an e-tee-wee-tee fan)
Comment: Grayson
It’s ninooooooooooooooo should do a will it food
Some of these newer Will It’s have been pretty disappointing.
Oh no ☹️
Do will it soda
Blood slime
Why link looks and acts like mcu bruce banner so much
that dolan twin joke gave me whiplash
Braxtyn is bad at fortnite
Anyone know the episode where Rhett is tossing some sprinkles or between his hands and then he misses and the bottle and spills everything?
Would love to see will it brownie lol.... If they haven't done it.
Love the above cams! Please keep them!!
I hope they were joking about not washing their hands
Old people like crocs? I usually see kids wearing them.
how funny, i was eating pizza while they made the pizza slime 😂🍕🍕🍕
The crock shoes look like the spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
Have you ever considered doing a Will It Eggs Benedict?
Pretend will it pizza 🍕! “We should just pretend too.” 😂 If only
I'm guessing they didn't eat borax in the pizza slime.
does anyone realize the cup in the bottom right corner, it says ear biscuits?
Might have to take the bike n head up to Jacksonville for that hmmmm, september 22nd woukd be great being my b day but I doubt its be on a Sunday:/
Your recent ear biscuit episode on whether your careers just peaked has never been more relevant...
Whenever there's a will it that doesn't involve food. You know that they are still gonna eat something
Pretty sure there’s a warning on windex bottles that says not to let it touch your skin
Happy Ramadan!
from now on I will only refer to rhett as “the big one”
Will it fountain? Just get a bunch of stuff and run it through a chocolate fountain machine thing and see if it will
you guys ever go home like "wanna watch dad eat weird stuff? :')"
8:33 does Link have nail polish on?!?
GMM IN YOUR AREA
Ha ha ha Crocks. I thought they were going to try prune juice when they mentioned senior citizens.
That hurts...
I love you guys.... Pleaseeee come to Boston!!!
“We could take over the world, or at least clean a window.” -Link Neal 2019
Will it link's home?
Ben at the very end of this video is the cutest little thing ever
You guys already did will it shoe...
Wish you guys would do a tour in the UK :( would for sure come if you guys did
Why not ATL?
will it hotdish
WILL IT GRILL CHEESE??????
Try should have had Karina Garcia or Talisa Tossel do this with them!
Why tf didn't you call it slimex?
Imagine if it was blood slime
Will it BBQ
They look like Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy with the sunscreen slime on their noses.
Will it waffle?
Is marshmallow from AO a boy or a girl?
I like Rhett's shirt.
TAMPAAAAAAA
Nickelodeon would disapprove  of all these slimes
Everything slimes today
7:03 me thinking I understand the subject then I get to the test
Good way to celebrate after finishing finals 😎
I approve of this video even more than usual because you destroyed Crocs. 👍👍👍👍👍👍
chicken
Will it sushi?
the only slime video I'm ever gonna be willing to watch
The wonderful world of will it's.
Are you a slimer ? Well I am !
Will it Fajita
Helllpp where’s the jacket fork link??????
It’s the best when you wake up to another GMM episode
their fingers probably smelled great after this
The slime crocks look like the spray on shoes from that one cartoon but i cant remember 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
9:47 That's a weird expression Rhett's doing right there.
The one GMM I couldn’t finish cuz the pizza slime looked waaaaay too much like vomit 🤢
Will it BLT????????????
Slime...so much fun it's a crime. And Despicable Me for picking on the minions with that one.
Why did they eat the pizza one but not the windex?
Yayyy
FRWAJIN 5 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS OBSESSED WITH GMM I REQUESTED THIS SO MUCH
"Finding it all over my *houseS*."
I need to get on the multiple houses level of life.
LTAT love the intro Goooood work guys !!! (: :3
Will it soap??
Rhett: “..I wouldn’t really call it slime..”
Both: “will it slime? YES!”
Us: uh....oh ok
Make this when Slime was relevant and your golden
Hey now!!!  I'm only 38 and I love my crocs. Soooooo comfy.
Did Link really spill windex or was he just helping to clean the floor
Did Link get replaced with his US clone?
rhett and link just made spray on shoes
One episode full of houses puns and slime
13:32 just close your eyes for a bit...
Why does link has a “3” on his right middle finger?
I can’t even make normal slime 😂😂😂
We all just gonna ignore the amount of foot stuff they've been doing lately?...
It doesn’t matter what year it is rhett and link will always have the only channel that every video is interesting
You had the opportunity to have Shane on the show and you passed it up
That's a big pizza slicer!
i thought the old people one would have been prune juice or maybe denture cream.
Will It Sandcastle?
Hello Rhett and Link
My name is Cemre ( pronounced Gem-Ray )
I think you’re great you tubers . Could I suggest an episode of Will it Soap.
From Cemre a great GMM fan
Good job guys <3
For those who are interested, i have a DIY channel , hurry up, i'm waiting for you 😘😘😘
I like how every morning at 6:00 am I look and see if they posted a new video 😂👌🏻❤️
Yo guys should try a will it coffee episode
You guys should get Brandon Farris on the show, he’s an up and coming YouTuber with a great sense of humor!!
I was going to guess  bingo as what senior citizens love more than anything but  I guess I was wrong 😂😂
“Your favorite Dolan twin”
Honestly he’s not wrong
Omg Dolan twin collab please 🙏
Let's see if I can catch it without looking, plop
From 10:19 to 10:25 close your eyes and listen o.o
Slime people are probably unsatisfied with the windex slime
Can you do a "Will it Patè?"
I have lost my respec. You can never have too much cheese
They need to make “spay on shoes!!” Next
Yo Rhett you look tired what happened?
Should do a will it sun tea
No one would think that it was weir if they saw you guys on the beach with bowls and sunscreen. They would just think, it’s just Rhett and Link doing their thing😄 ⛱
Borax is toxic, causing fertility issues and miscarriages so giving it to children in the form of slime is not a great idea
Can you guys do a Will it Waffle Iron episode?
I could smell the windex
"Slimers" huh....


with each passing day I learn a  new moronic fact about people.
Link, that's a nice jacket.  💖
12:00 “slocks”
Me: crime
What up slimers LOL!
Link in that jacket can destroy my life is he wants
“✌🏼 what up slimers”
Really offended that you're not coming to St. Louis.
So no Florida shows?
Ya done plum gon dagone did it now, son.
Will It Rhett & Link? 😮
they said dolan twins while i’m sitting here wearing their hoodie and sweats!😂
0:24-0:31 they should've said "Rhett and Link in your area" like how blackpink says it 😂
Links lookin restless in this one, maybe they’re getting close to another change
I read the title as will it smith
I can smell the Windex.
If u are a parent of a slimer leave a like.
Some science. Soap is a surfactant, so it lowers surface tension. I'm gonna guess that it needs to be fully mixed with the Windex to assure the surfactant is fully dispersed. I'm glad to know my college time isn't being wasted.
That Windex slime is also used to get rid of pimples and cure almost any injury or illness.
TEXNEIQUES
No blood slime?
"Your such an *overcheeser*" 😂😂
"Age-old question"
Still no Toronto/Ottawa/Montreal??😭
The satisfying-slime-video enthusiasts are quaking
Anyone else been constantly waiting for this

Yeah.....Me too
RHETT & LINK IN THE AREA! 🎤
That desk does NOT get enough credit!
7:06 Link.exe has stopped working
the first one is dough not slime lol
Links Croc made of slime looks like the spray on shoe from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
if feared he was gonna spull windex into his mug
Pls do a will it macaron!!
We ask will it, but do we ever ask should it?
Is the shoe segment a prototype to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' Spray-on Shoes.
They should change the name of the show to, two man children make messes for others to clean up
These are two full grown adults, that do things like this for their actual career. Better than a desk job tho
Fuku
I'd have thought the windex one would be called slimdex
pepperoni! theres not an s
799+ dislikes are from pasta lovers
How can there be cheese from Finland when Finland doesn't exist, helloooo?!
Personally, I think Link looks amazing with these salt and pepper hair
#linkappreciation
I got a feeling there's a lot of people that want that shirt!
4:14 Scandinavian Cheese Coffee
7:18 Weird Salsas
12:50 Lost Causes of Bleak Creak Cover
18:35 Sound Byte Game- Guess the GMM Episode
Please make an Operation game board using the Rhett naked picture.
Jade just laying in links lap lounging is a full mood for Saturday’s
Can we please have a will it oreo? Mixing the cookie with something and then piping more on the inside (like dog food, salsa, frosted mini wheats, pork blood, etc)
I liked that listen game. Great to watch their reactions!
Oh my gahd. I thought that the Rhett shirt was official merch and I was so ready to go to the mythical store.
Stevie was extra funny in this episode. Also, please keep playing the listening game. I've never laughed so hard this early in the morning before. 😂
‘YOUR WEINER IS THE SIZE OF AN INFANT’S NOSE’ is my new catch phrase.
"Go all the way down" had me laugh crying 🤣😂
'Your Weiner is the size of an infants nose'
Link, May, 2019
@5:23 Link and that pup trying to decipher what's in that spoon is the best thing.
Rhett: Finnish people aren’t real

Also Rhett: (is moving to Finland for the cheese and coffee)
Rhett: i want to offer my body to science 

Scientist everywhere: no

Rhett: art

Artist everywhere: no
David was so focused on not spilling as he was putting the coffees on the table. He's such a good stuff bringer-inner 😂
Anybody remember when Link wasn't a dog person? Just look how defeated he is when Jade attacks him with all that cutesness! :P
Look, I need the shirt. Need it. Please. I will do anything. Not anything, but something. Anything within reason. On top of the price of the shirt. I will shave my beard and my beard is huge.
Listen, I always love Stevie but she was ON FIYAH this episode. Also please make an “Rhett’s infant nose” shirt for Link.
Kaffe = coffee ☕️ and ost = cheese 🧀 in Swedish, but, this is actually a very old tradition and I would not say that it is very common in the modern households anymore ;) 
🇸🇪🥰
My birth date is October 29th, 1992. I guess I am destined to buy this book 🤷🏼‍♀️
Jade: dad imma chill wit u ❤️

Barbara: k bye
"A nil, Link gives it a nil *chuckles*" clever one link 12:43
you guys need more dart throwing games I love those and peeker picker poker face
The book Rhett was reading was “Oksana, Behave!” by Maria Kuznetsova, if anyone is interested! 😋
Be
Your
Mythical
Best
Forever
On
Saturdays
Homies
Okay
😂😋🤗
When you’re early but also want to go back to sleep
I just wanna know how many of you guys actually DM Stevie for that shirt?
"That is delicious.. how much sugar did you put in there?" Her little giggle omg she's adorable
In Finland we call that cheese "leipä juusto" which translates to bread cheese.
Fastforward 2 months later:

Rhett: "Need to have me Naked?? Buy this limited time t-shirt on mythical.store"
Watching R&L squirming and listening to all the dang things they say was the best thing all week. XD Thank you, Stevie!
10:22
Link: is this kimchi
Rhett: crunches yUhH
We’re gonna need that shirt.
Stevie: "I am really hot"


Understatement of the century.
Why is Stevie so beautiful? She has the most gorgeous skin and hair
You are gonna get a lot more requests than you will expect. It'll be on next weeks LTAT.
I lost my pup a month ago. She was a dachshund and Jades personally reminds me so much of her 
Please give her all the kisses Link!
I love the intros, “I’m feeling it now Mr. crabs” 😂😂
"Your weiner is the size of an infants nose"
Stevie is really just out here enabling the shippers every time she's on camera and I for one support her.
Starting at 13:56 - one of the funniest minutes of anything Rhett and Link related in a LONG time. I was hysterical.
"Butt first " , please invite Sortedfoods back?
My favorite part in the episode is Rhett reading lines from that random book. 🤣
I'm asking for a "friend" how dose one acquire such an item 👀
Rhett to Barbara- "I like you more than my boys" lol! She's his little princess.
May the Fourth be with you mythical beasts 💥
LMMFAO!!!! Had me hurting from laughing so hard during the game at the end. Such a great bit. Thank you I needed that laugh.
Oh my goodness Barbra got so big she's so cute Rhett you just go soft and cute with her. Link you too are soo adorable with Jade. I melt just to see men be so sweet. 
Mythical beast fan
Shannon Wilkinson
I would buy the poster version of nekkid Rhett 😊😂😎
Yey! A perfect birthday gift a book by my favorite people! Thank you guys! I'm excited! 😁
Idk why but something is telling me that shirt of Rhett needs to be on me. 24/7.
I’m so sorry Rhett but Links dog is like a tiny bit cuter
Ive just realized how weird it can be when only hearing the audio and out of context XD Its great xD lol
This show is like the PG-13/R version of the main show XD
HAHAH how could rhett forget “go all the way down”😂that was so funny.  remember when link did the popeye laugh
This LTAT episode used to be named “Eating Weird Salsas” or something like that.
Stevie mocks them better than we could hope for!! Pls make that a yoursoloud collab somehow 😂😂😂
“Go all the way down” STILL one of my favorite episodes to date + the hand holding was great.
Stevie's shirt is fantastic, I just wish I wasn't drinking a Dr. Pepper when she revealed it, I had soda come out of my nose lol
Link gives it a neal UNDERRATED
Here in Puerto Rico we've been drinking coffee with cheese since for ever.
Finnish squeaky cheese yet Finland doesn't exist! Leipäjuusto in Finnish. Kaffeost in Swedish. In case anyone's wondering 😉
Tbh that whole listening game would make a great innuendo bingo! they should make an episode playing that
Stevie's mouth looks just like Avril Lavigne's. Especially when she smiles! She's super cute xD
Stevie: "You can not say everyone gets a dachshund! Everyone does NOT get a dachshund! We're going to get nasty letters!"😂😂😂
I want that shirt
dearest linky-poo, your fosho‘s get quieter and quieter every saturday. we are worried. xoxo, a worried mythical beast
Stevie: "is this hot?"
Rhett:"no it's room temp'

😹😹😹😹😹
“Go all the way down!” In the creepy voice 😂.
“Let’s just see how many requests we get.”

Waaay more than what’s appropriate, probably! 😆
The way Rhett says salsa: "SAUWSA"
12:33
Link "Is asparagus a fruit??"
flashback to Link's pickle pants moment
Love the Beavis and Butthead reference!
I LOVE seeing that Link is wearing that Mythical hoodie, because I was FINALLY able to order mine yesterday!!!!! 😍😍😍
I spent the entire time watching Jade! 😍
Stevie, I just feel in love with you...I also have my entire collection of Goosebumps and Animorphs from my childhood!!!
A beavus and butthead reference oh boi
I like how over the years they have stopped caring what they say 😂😂😂 it really cracks me up
Kaffeost ( kaffe ost - coffee cheeese) is the swedish word, the cheese is mainly from finland. I'm swedish and I've never heard of it but it seems to be a thing in some parts of sweden. Leipäjuusto seems to be the finnish word for it according to wikipedia, idk how accurate that is. 

Had to look it up bc yall confused me by caling it swedish when I've never heard of it. Sooo yeah if anyone cares now you know
A spongebob reference and a Beavis & Butthole reference right off the rip? Wow haha
I am in love with Stevie's voice
Jade is so adorable & wants to lay with Link the whole time. Barbara is also adorable but only got t to see her for about 3 minutes. Maybe she’ll come back to Rhett again later in the show
Can they play innuendo bingo with GMM clips?
I laughed harder watching this LTAT than I thought was physically possible; it’s certainly been my favorite one yet😂😂
I want a T-shirt w a naked LINK on it, please & thank you!
The book inside is “Oksana, Behave”
If I may, if you wish to put praise for the Book of Mythicality I would suggest putting it on the back. I feel like it looks really tacky on the front when other books do that and takes away from the cover.
A SpongeBob reference, a Beavis and Butthead reference, and two dogs within the first minute of this video.. 




I think I found the perfect channel.
I love how Barbara always runs away, yet Jade always stays right by Link's side. She is such a good girl!
"aspragadus" -Link Neal, 2019
Best LTAT so far!!🤣🤣🤣
We're gonna do the ol' squeeze and pull
7:49 and 8:27 Link and Stevie are on fire today!!!
0:34   Rhett telling his dog    -I like you more than my boys.  That part cracked me up xD
Wait wasn’t this ‘weird salsa taste test’ before??
Everytime they pan over to Rhett&Link I keep thinking Rhett’s arm in on Links shoulder. It’s the pillows fault.
The actual book is "Oksana, Behave!" by  Maria Kuznetsova

wtaf
early squad where you attttt?
and no, im not asking you Tom the Cat.
I love LTAT!!! This is a great episode. I’ve already watched and laughed twice! 😂
It looks like the book that the Bleak Creek cover was placed upon is "Oksana, Behave!" based on by research. I can't find any matches for that second sentence, but the one about Anatoli Petrovich brought me to the right place.
I want to see more of Rhett laughing. He has such a great laugh.
“I’m not looking at you, I’m looking at me. I’m looking at you on my shirt.. me on my shirt.. me on your shirt!” 😂
TeePee for my bung-hole
Hands down one of the best LTAT's episodes if u make a montage this would be a good one... one sec while I DM Stevie... 😂 👌🏻
The finish squeky cheese, is called leipä juusto.”bread cheese” and you usually eat it with some cloudberry jam. You can eat it hot or cold! But its yummy! Greetings from finland👋🏻☺️
Bruh I’m crying that quote is my favorite Link quote
We’re gonna get demonetized BARBRA
WILL IT TAMALE?!? (Love yalls show!❤️💯)
What you feel? I am not mr. Crab Stevie.

The doggos 💚💚💚💚
I really want that Rhett shirt but only if it has the tagline "Now go all the way down" 😂😂😂😂
Oh my god! You are the only person other than myself that I know of that has read ALL of the Animorphs series! I feel a soul sister connection 😄
OK... I'm done watching. Time to DM Stevie for the shirt!
theres nothing i love more than rhett and barbaras relationship
WHY IS LINKS NAME ACTUALLY Charles Lincoln Neal.   😶
I don't usually enjoy reading, but i will definitely be looking for y'alls book 👍
Having to work on a Saturday is a little better after watching The Show About The Show ❤️
I'm from Sweden and have never had Kaffeost. I have heard about it. But I think it's a thing only old people from northern Sweden do...
It would be really neat to see the options for the book cover...
You guys should do a game where the gmm crew dramatically reads reddit posts, and then Rhett and Link guess which subreddit it belongs to.
10:00 and 14:13 had me in tears.. I had to watch this video twice 😂😂😂
when is the audiobook coming? I want Rhett and Link to do the audiobook voices =]
Saturday Link is much smarter than Monday thru Friday Link combined lol
I didn't know until now that I needed this but they should play Innuendo Bingo from BBC Radio One with clips like these 😆
Are you going to offer autographed copies of your new book?
1:18

Barbara: "Whoa....did not sign up for this s***!!"
such a giddy episode, I love it!!! the book cover looks amazing
The stuff Rhett read from the book was amazing 😆
LTAT!!!!!! This is the best thing Rhett and Link have ever had their names on.
Man boys like these make me relieved my barley teenaged brother is gay
So the first 1 minute was akward hah
"I'm sorry, what i meant was DON'T LOOK AT ME"
Remember when Rhett and Link said they would NEVER get dogs!!!
The into killed me!!! Stevie is queen!!! Cause I'm feeling it too!!!
That shirt is worth giving thanos the stones
“He’s got two in a row!”
Link’s on a word streak everyone look out 😂
Is it sad I actually really want that shirt haha 😆
Some of the best salsa I’ve ever had, was smoked Peach and habanero salsa! Just thought I’d share a little bit of happiness in my otherwise, dull and dreary life...Have a great weekend my fellow brother and sister Mythical Beasts! ✌️❤️🐔🔥🦄
I didn't want this episode to end.
Rhett keeps munching on those chips lol
I wish I could buy and read the book :(
We need that shirt in the store 👀
Yaay go Sweden! You guys actually pronunced kaffeost pretty good! :)
“Is it hot though?”
“It’s room temp.”

Rhet, nooooooo
😂😂😂 Stevie got so aggressive at 9:45 it was glorious! It’s so funny because she’s so naturally sweet, I love the aggressive Stevie!
"Will It Dumpling?"!! 😂 one of my favorite GMM episodes!! 😂😂
OMG I want one of those shirts!!!!!
Jade is an amazing dog
Love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's frustrating that the chip baskets weren't lined with anything.
Not gonna lie, but I want that shirt
I read the E news article and my first thought was “Youtubers made a good book? Wait... something ain’t right here.”
I have to get up early for work, and it’s nice too see all the people who are up this early on a Saturday too. (Unless you’re in a different time zone) 😂
00:42 I HAVE LITERALLY NEVER HEARD ANYONE OUTSIDE OF MY FAMILY CALL IT THAT

MY LIFE HAS BEEN VALIDATED THANK YOU
I think Rhett finally realized that Finland is real cuz he said he wants to move there for that coffee 😂 btw I NEED that shirt 😁
Love the Beavis & Butthead intro
Do a dart throwing game where you guys where the chocolate is from or candy!!
their book releases on my birthday!! 😂😁
Personally I actually enjoy LTAT more than GMM! Makes me look forward to my Saturdays.
Leipäjuusto mainittu! Paras juusto maailmassa!

Finnish squeaky cheese is the best thing in the world!

Sauce: i’m a Finn.
go all the way down
😆
Also ... Link needs that t-shirt too.
ART THOU FEELING IT NOW, MR.KRABS?
nOw Go aLl ThE Way dOWn
Will the book be available on Audible? I love reading but also love listening to audiobooks while I work. It would be extra cool if it was narrated by Rhett & Link.
Link is aging gracefully. He's a handsome dude.
Such a random observation but does anyone else think that Stevie would cosplay as a great Zelda?!
I’m feelin it now mr crabs
yeah rhett and link are cool but what about
*jade*
Stevie:"I am realllly hot"
Us: "yes... Yes you are..."
I give this LTAT a good, but because of Jade I’ll now give it a great.
I've had the book preordered since the first announcement! So excited to see it start to come to life. I love you guys ❤❤
This saturday, has officially got better.
Stevie, I have all of the Choose Your Own Adventure Goosebumps books! I read Animorphs, but never owned any though...

Okay. Ciao, mama! 💋👋
Bunghole is the funniest word ever
Ive been thinking of the guessing episode for years now. Finally.
Wow you guys just went full meme mode today, and I love it! 😂
I love that beanie!!
Plz send me shirts
that was definitely your best opening line
"Go ALL the way downnn" bahaha from the best GMMORE in recent weeks. They really made some great jokes about each other that episode
12:47 Link gives it a Nil.... most underrated joke of this whole episode lololol
19:20 Link looks exactly like his dad here.
Never have I ever been this early for GMM... hehe
Jade laying in links lap is so cute
This episode is so great😂
😂😂😂 i loved the boy's reaction to the "go all the way down" clip. RandL were so giggly and cute that s'more.  such a great LTAT today. so many great moments.  the book excerpts, "you been reading again". i am going to have a smile on my face for a while and anytime i think back on this episode. good job y'all.
A thousand likes and they need to mass produce Rhett's body on to tshirts
Vafan, kaffe ost? Alldrig haft det. Well thats somthin new for me
OMG her opening line!!! That is like one of my fav SpongeBob quotes!!!🧽🧽
One of the best LTATs yet!
For some odd reason I have always wanted to put cheese into hot cocoa... Or like oatmeal??
“Is it hot though?” 
“It’s room temp”
I don’t think that’s what she was asking Rhett but ok
best youtubers
Second

Edit : wait this video just uploaded like 2 mins ago and it's already got 4 dislikes? Buttt whatever
What does Link say in ASL at the very end.   Between the focus and the speed, I can see anything but the I love you..
Lol Rhett and Stevie have great chemistry, just great comedic timing together!
Very long time fan, I absolutely love everything that you all do. Keep up the good work! I'll eventually get some of your merch!😂
That’s it! I have a crush on Stevie. She’s just too cute and she cracks me up. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Favorite LTAT as of the current date. Lol
Im sure that will change next week.
You know link will milk that picture for all he can.... he finally has something good on Rhett
All of those GNM clips sound dirty. Quite sure that’s on purpose.
7:47 is when I spewed cereal milk out my nose and almost died LMFAO
I like how Jade really wanted some Svvedish coffee, and didn’t get any. Then he/she kept staring at the coffee in the corner of his/her eye
Go all the way down😊
"Go all the way down"
Just reminding everyone that Stevie is beautiful
I love Jade's facial expressions. She is absolutely adorable.
This is my favorite episode of LTAT
If people say this is a family friendly Channel........





Not anymore deal with it
In case anyone is wondering, the book they put the cover on (with the kinda weird excerpt that Rhett read) 

Is called Oksana, Behave! By Maria Kuznetsova
I knew the "go all the way down" clip in a heartbeat 🤣
The intro is literally my favorite sound rn 😂
Anatoly Petrovich: Grandma Bedder Extraordinaire
Seeing a burly man like Rhett love on the girliest dog is super precious.
"Go all the way down" i still think that is the best MORE so far 😂
9:50 the dog on the links lap is so clute
Stevie: "Go all the way down"
oooohh mahhh gaaaawwddd
David you did a great job man! Keep it up.
I want Jontron on gmm pls
GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. Stevie ❤️
im from sweden and i have never in my life heard of kaffeost (coffee cheese) XD
The Which Episode Game starts at 19:00
“Go all the way down” 
I can’t 😂 tears! So many tears!
I want a shirt 🤣🤣 (but for real)
I’ll take one shirt, please!
Benign Masochism?  I've always just called it "Tonguishment" (Tung-ish-ment)
I'm tired and I'm proud!
I need a clip of Steve saying go all the way down it excited me in an excited kind or way.
That was by far the best intro
I love the MERCH that link is wearing
I feel like ltat just keeps getting better and better each episode. I had to replay so many parts just from laughing so hard that I missed what was happening on screen.
I would watch 30 min to a lifetime of Stevie smiling. Million dollar smile
I'm so excited for y'alls book! 😁
Oh my gosh...i also call it a zurburt and my husband always looks at me like "wtf did you just say" I knew I wasn't the only one! Thanks Rhett!
Anyone else see Link attempting to sign FOSHO at the end and then just giving up and signing "i love you" instead? 😂😭
By far the best intro you've done.
How could Rhett forget about 'go all the way down' 😂
Link looks so good in those glasses! He should wear those more often!
Heck yeah Eerie Indiana (the show not the books tho).
Did not expect that intro
4:17 I had feeling he would make that joke 🤔
Stevie heard the lawsuits immediately as soon as Rhett mentioned the free dogs
BEST INTRO EVER
Remake the unicorn rap
What if GMM hearted me, i've been watching them for 4 years
:o link is form NC!!😍
y'all got Ice JJ Fish working for you now?
6:00 You fools! You just dunk them in the hot coffee, then eat them away with a fork from there before drinking the coffee.
They should've walked in with each others dogs in their hands instead of their own
I need a gif of 6:18 - Stevie saying “Sugar is great”
YES ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS
shows all sides including the ones not designed "we've only designed this part so we're only going to show you this part"
Jade is cuter, Barbara would win a dog show. I like cats.
I can't wait for the release of the book
Goosebumps and Animorphs! Stevie know what’s up.
"Ost" means "cheese" in Swedish🇸🇪
were gonna get DEMONITIZED, BARBARA
"Weird Sauce-uh Taste Test"
5:00 - trace minerals in water account for a percentage of the sodium contents in water. The more water one drinks, the more flushed out their body becomes, excess salt goes along with it and the sodium contents that would normally replace the sodium that got flushed isn't there in the water to begin with, the salt is then not absorbed and sodium deficiency happens.
early!

Edit: who's here before 500 views?
2:00 the excitement is real.
THE PATCH 💀😂😂
This so much fun love let's talk about that.  Stevie is so awesome
Ordered mine the day it came up for preorder on Amazon.  Pumped.
Stevie’s smile when she peeled off the black tape. Absolutely priceless.
full episode of LTAT - ASMR with Stevie, pleeeaassee
The hand holding smore was pretty memorable, I think I watched it at least 3 times, it was hilarious.
I SHIP RHINK!!!
Yesss! Every opening quote should be a spongebob quote!!
I love LTAT! Favorite time of the week!!!
This opening was legendary
if anyone was wondering, the book that rhett read an excerpt from is called "The Yalta Conference"
bruh link is so cool lowkey
“It’s-a fine!”
I laughed way to much. This is your funniest episode ever.
I now live for Saturdays!  What a great way to start the day; laughing to tears!
Will the book be released on any online platform? I read most things digitally becuase technology. 😂
I would love that shirt more if link was next to Rhett
I'll take a shirt lol
Thanks to this ep I have a new headcanon: link is a bottom
Love that little 30% less comment Stevie threw in and R&L missed. 😉
LTAT has become one of my absolute  favorite shows, love that we get a video from yall 7 days a week now :)
Yes Stevie, you are really hot.
Fresh squeaky cheese from Wisconsin is delicious
rhett actually pronounced kaffeost really well haha
Good lord Jade is all the preciousness!!!
So, curds in the coffee would work.  Prolly.
remake the unicorn rap
1:30
I think Jade is a snake
stevie:   i am really hooot

me:   yes,   yes you are <3 ~
still can't get over rhett's anatomy picture
Eerie  Indiana  reference  thats the real stevie
God I’ve been too busy to watch any of this, but I finally caught a break and love watching this stuff. Keep it up!
Depending on what month that book takes place, I was not a person during the story.
Can't stop looking at baby Jade <3
May the 4th be with y'all
in finland we call the cheese 
bread cheese and it is good!!
Now I watch GMM so that I'm prepared for LTAT
just ordered the book! SO excited
The audio clips are so hilarious. I love this show so much.
This may be the peak season of GMM, or this is the gold standard. I have absolutely loved this Season.
You like Finnish squeaky cheese, huh, Rhett? I thought Finland wasn’t real, RHETT.
Link trying to do sign language 😂 and what Rhett read from the book
Wow  im from Yalta
great dane and/or Mastiff pups....that's what you all need, lol.  :)
The great cornhulio needs tipi for his bunghole!!!
Quality memes right at the beginning
14:05 Oksana, Behave!  Page 165 if you were interested
The cover reminds me of Adrift and I’m not okay...
When they played the first clip...link was so still & focused that i had to rewind the video to make sure it was not an error on my end
That shirt is everything I never knew I needed.
In Puerto Rico we put cheese on our hot cocoa! So good!
No one noticed that






They changed the title
Well I’m distracted by Stevie’s beauty.
That last audio clip had me cracking up at work. It's hilarious how bad those clips sounded when taken waaaay out of context.
Growing up we had chunks of cheddar with our coffee & keebler soda crackers. Is it a Hispanic thing or Gonzalez/ Tirado thing 😂😂
FINALLY A GREAT INTRO!!! LOVE BEAVIS
Stevie is iconic asf
Stevie is really cute tbh
Stevie , will you marry me ?
Barbara & Jade are stinking cute!! My German Shepherd girly, Naga, agrees. :)
You should do will it salsa for May 5th (Cinco De Mayo)
Stevie has the perfect voice.
g o  a l l  t h e  w a y  d o w n
But.....will it vacuum seal? 😮
I love that book cover, it's so cool and well done

The book looks so good. I can't wait for it to come out!
GO ALLLL THE WAY DOWN

The intro keeps getting better
stevie not liking the third salsa might have been one of the cutest things ive ever seen 11:58
"You´re so close to the answer... just go all the way down."  :)
Stevie has a good laugh. Never noticed
That shirt came out of left field 😳🥴😂😂😂
Link’s got words!
This is my favorite LTAT episode to date!
Hot chocolate and cheese is way better. I group drink it that way and I love it!
"It's gluten free"
me: Yeah. Asparagus is gluten free. Just like apples are fat free and bread is dairy free.
Their kids are so blessed to have these comical hearty men as fathers 💕
Best intro ever😂
Why would you uploaded at three in the morning?
Snot Mike puffed he
is the cheese coffee technically soup?
I love to see their reactions. Great video 👍🏻
Best part 22:53 xD
Are you feeling it now mr krabs?
Finally you guys are the best always give me a smile
Dang, it's already been 5 years since I've been watching!

GO ALL THE WAY DOWN
Im from Sweden and have never before heard of kaffeost. I thout it was i lie in the game.
#outofcontext LOL!!🤣
This was a great start to my Saturday 😁
Wow Stevie is beautiful
I wish Link loved me/was obsessed with me as he is of Jade. Lol
I love waking up to 2 grown men, and 1 grown woman, drinking cheese coffee, and petting dogs.
I'm very excited about this book! I will have it!!
I NEED THAT SHIIRT
He said “Dink before the cheese” but all I heard was “Dink Cheese” 😳
Had to re-watch some parts because I was distracted by the Barbara and Jade cuteness.
0:00 - 1:00 I dont think I've ever been more confused
You do realize the rhink edits are gonna be real weird with this right
God I love those dogs so much
already pre-order your book. can't be the only one?
The setting of your book, is the year I was born. Im 27.
Stevie makes this show so good
I WANT THAT SHIRT!!!!!
Will lost causes be on Audible?
DNA TEST YOUR DOGS!
DO ANOTHER WATER FILTER VIDEO, THEY ARE AWSOME 😬😮
I remember that "let's blow on each other" moment
I definitely don’t see a hand on the cover of the book.
Will you narrate it on audible?
Stevie is such a fox.
Oh my god, Link is so cute in this! With Jade climbing around him and laying in his lap. And his hair matches his hoodie! Lol
This had me dying
Rhett has the best taste buds in the game
OMG I love jade!!!
Best intro yet
That shirt makes me uncomfortable I don't see how Stevie wears it😂.
They should make that shirt an item in the GMM store.  I would prefer to have one with just naked Rhett.
Go all the way down!
During the episode listening segment, Jade looked like she was thinking “why am I here” 😂
Jade is such a lapdog, oml
Best intro ever!
Snot myka puffde
Rhett had 3 from 3. I want that shirt.
Whasnt this a family friendly show?
"SUGAR?? IS G R E A T"
Bolivia's had cheese in coffee for forever. It is delicious!
The great Cornholio's
Please link the episodes :(
Jade is the real star
Stevie is an icon
EARLY! WOOP!
Going to preorder the book closer to the release date also wearing the mythical society shirt love it and recently noticed the Rhett and link signatures where the tag is
1:57 *Link*: Whaaaa, whaaa?
... I'm gonna need to read that placeholder book 😂
Your welcome to Sweden Rhett... :D
Is it just me or did they have special muffins again
“have you been reading again?” omg lmao
“breathe man, breathe. have some salsa”
I like how Jade is a total daddy's girl and Barbara's just like "Bye!" lol
I loved this episode. 😂
Best intro yet!! LOL!!
Stevey is so pretty
Jade is actually a cat. Nyk.
In north England blackberries are called brambles
I just love Jade so much y’all
I’m obsessed with Barbara.
People also eat that cheese with cloudberry jam. Probably while also drinking coffee.
They are reading a excerpt from Oksana, Behave! by Maria Kuznetsova
i need that shirt.
Steve stone as ever!
I honestly did not see the hand on the cover until Rhett mentioned it 😂
Stevie’s laugh is contagious - she’s so cute
Ooooh sneaking that in 8:27
Taste Test: Air Fryer vs Regular Fryer
Art thou feeling it now mr krabs
Jade is such a cute dog! Her ears are soo beautiful.
I need that shirt!
both need TP for their bungholes
The beavis and butthead reference was amazing and also makes me feel old.
Wait, so is it leipäjuusto ?
Welp.... I want the shirt.
Go all the way down
Go all the way down
Love this!💖
I need doritos
Jade intensely staring at the cheese is my fav part
I have a shirt like links sweater but it says south park instead of mythical and the 4 main characters on front
PLEASE PLEASE DO MORE OF THE GUESS THAT EPISODE
I would love that shirt stevie!!!
Jade is such a lap dog!! Living the good life!! Good going, Jade!!
5:00 look at the guys face
Cheese coffee sounds like a bowel explosion.
MAKE THE SHIRT HAPPEN
Almost first... but not quite.
Ost is cheese in swedish 😊
Ok but. We need that shirt.
I WANT A NAKED RHETT SHIRT!!!
I love Stevie so much 😍😍😍
11:33 David Lynch thanks you.
On the back of the book you should write 
Go read the book where not going to spoil anything for any of you guys and her reading her book with a giant arrow pointing to the front of the book
Coffee cheese or leipäjuusto (in Finnish) is so good 😍
Stevie, the fact that you still have the entire collection of Goosebumps and Animorphs makes me insanely envious. I miss those collections.  Please tell me you were a Tobias?
I actually pre-ordered on Amazon today, and no, the new cover isn't on there yet.
I need that shirt
My dogs name is also Jade. I had to rewind the video to make sure I was hearing you all right. I love you guys
I need to get up at 6am
stevie is so cute! and that shirt is awesome!
“Link gives it a nil (Neal)”
I like to listen to GMM while folding my laundry.
510 views when I’m here
Nothing warms the heart like seeing two grown men snuggle and cuddle and babytalk a pair of doggos! ^___^
Can't believe they forgot 'go all the way down.' I was crying laughing when I first saw it. 😂
Go all the way down lmao
Go all the way down.
Yes I’m actually kinda early for once I think
Need that shirt!!!
Kaffeost is the swedish word but the tradition comes from northern Finland and Tornedalen (basically cities and villages around the swedish/finnish border). It's pretty common in northern Sweden where I'm from but it's usually older people that enjoy it.
Rhett and Link with their dogs might be better than Rhett and Link without their dogs.
I need that shirt.
Beavis and Butthead intro, guess Rhett would be Beavis and Link, Butthead lol 😎
I actually hope the back cover stays blank. It looks cool
PUT TFIL ON YOUR SHOW!!
please audiobookkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!
Animorphs<3
Lol that opening tho 😆
The book cover looks awesome!!
Salas? Isn't it salsa? I'm kidding I know, look at the title
You guys neeeeed to try irish candy like actual dairy milk chocolate
Jade is too adorable
Someone knows the name of the book, the one they put under the cover?
Stevie, slap a naked Link on the back of that shirt and sell it as merch.
You should do an evolution video....something that shows how you guys have evolved from when you first started gmm till now. I think it would be cool to see.
🤟🏼 too, Link!
Hey you guys are awesome and my favorite youtube show
I couldn't focus on the episode because Jade is so dang cute
I need more Christine action
Link's outfit in this episode is a look for sure
Everything they say ends up sounding like their relationship is waaaay closer than they let on
love this vid
So much for watching the show with my family. I've got young kids guys! Come on!
What's the book about Anatoly and Grandma?
Love this show lol
Play the listening game again! Please!
2:30 Oh, yeah that is right. I never noticed before.
Best day of the week
5:24 The second time he said it he pronounced it almost perfectly 👏
10/10 would buy that shirt without question lol
I love Stevie😭💘
Yalta Conference
WERE GONNA GET DEMONETIZED BARBRA!!
I need this shirt.
5:40 But would you eat cereal with with cheese, just because it's good with cereal?
Those puppies are so cuteeee 😩❤😩❤😩❤😩❤😩❤ awwwwwww
3:55 Jade there is basically me.
please anyone. is there any actual way to get this shirt. I require it for my shrine
I need to know what that book he read the excerpt from was. Not because I wanna read it because i absolutely do not, i need it for other unrelated reasons
I love how Jade was just walking around behind them as they talked. She’s so cute 💖
No one, literally not a soul: ...


Link: Aspragatus?
HOW IS THERE CHEESE FROM FINLAND IF FINLAND DOESN’T EXIST
HELLOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
The just audio of episodes is hilarious.  Love GMM
Cant wait to read it!! I have your first book as well!!
Yeah BOI here early again
MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU
Is it hot though? No its room temp.....lmao she obviously meant the spice level Rhett
Nice Beavis and Butthead reference.
I swear I watch these just to see Stevie shine. She’s really cute
I love Rhett's dog
Link looks like a SNACK today
Just go with it ! Keep the back cover like that.


Btw, I think the final line Rhett read, I think it is a girl who is happy that her teenage brother is gay because she finds a lot of straight guys to be such a-holes.
I would like a "Rhett's Genetalia" shirt.
You should start a new series on Salsa sauce
2:34 u right Stevie
Beavis and butthead go hard
Is nobody gonna say that one time Rhett and Link were in the music video for sorry for party rocking? By LMFAO?
Rhett's face reminds me too much of Ned Kelly
Are you feeling it now?  Mr.  Krabs.
Lol LTAT is my favourite
I need the shirt!
Use me as a “I’ll buy that shirt if you make it” button.
Love your dog Link, what breed is it?
I’d love a "leaving things in pickling liquid for a month" episode
That kaffeost is a staple in my childhood i love it😁
Small dogs are only worth their estimated "contribution" to the nrarest burrito.
I SAID I WANTED THAT RHETT DIAGRAM ON A SHIRT ON THE ORIGINAL EPISODE AND NOW I WANT IT EVEN MORE
stevies shirt was the best thing, it would be even better if david was drawn in the style of rhett
0:42 OMG callback to the cosby show I hope hahaahaahha I love the show and reference
based in the year I was born. 92.
Barbs look like Rhett😂
Okay, what in the mythical eff is going on with that shirt. Good God.
The lasy 15 minutes of this episode should be retitled "Gay Mythical Morning"
i’m going to sleep... oh wait nvrmnd after this 💯👌
HOW COULD THEY EXPOSE THE PUPPY TO THAT HORROR!?!?!?!?!
The cover looks like its in the dean koontz style, looks awesome
This book dates to just before I was born...
1:25 did Jade raspberry at Stevie’s important announcement
I want a naked Rhett shirt please!
I have a entire collection of goosebumps to. Right beside a entire collection of Stephen King and Dean Koon. Constant reader, can't wait for your book
Hahahahhahahahahahah 😂😂😂
4:59 lol his face im dying
Finland is real now Rhett?
i need sleep stop
I died when Stevie said I get 30%less.
Awwww, love the doggies in the show. 😍😍☺️
"Sawsa"
I'm a simple person, I see dogs and like the video
Jade is so damn adorable! Her coloring makes it look like she is wearing a bad toupee. I love her!
You guys should do a blind beef jerky taste test on GMM
Sometimes Rhett and link have the exact same laugh and it really trips me up
2019 will go down as the year the filters weakened.
I'd totally buy that t-shirt Stevie, but can you also make one with Link's anatomy from the poster too? PACKAGE DEAL
The amount of people who have "never been this early for GMM" is too high!
510th ooooh
I'm a kid, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?
Jade wanted to get down from the couch.  then she did and Link picked
her up and put her back on his lap.  he should have just let her wander
around the studio like Barbara was doing!!  great episode of LTAT too.
loved the clips Rhett and Link talking without the video!!
I’d wear that shirt. 😂😂
"Finnish" squeaky cheese, huh?
I'm here what i miss
0:05 yo what, everybody gonna ignore this? not even one word? ok
They must have filmed the fruit peeling episode a while ago.
There was a time when GMM was a wholesome family show.

 Thank god that time is over.
Its 3am send help I need sleep
"Just put it in your mouth and hold it."  "Don't bite!"   .......
you should make your  videos one hour long when you do these episodes
I will always love that Rhett loves all the food
10:15 and pause. Your welcome.
Omg the cuteness. Might faint
The book takes place in the year I was born. Never knew there was a horror story of my origins.
Growing up we used to drink cafe con leche and dip red rind cheddar wedges in it until it melted a bit and had all that with cuban crackers... also dipped lol ❤
You know you're up too late at night when GMM uploads a new video
Gotta watch this before going to sleep. #nightowl



 ♥
Can we get a shirt that says “I am a sweet peach that knows it’s worth” because I’d buy that in a heartbeat
does anyone know what was that book Rhett was reading?
I got all of them right before the boys wooo
I've seen so many episodes so many times that I know their show better than they do.
I wanted to make a salsa joke..
but I never sal-SAW a good joke..
Finally these two get to taste their own medicine🙌🏻 and its super funny
Jade is literally like my baby 😭 climbing all over the couch then sitting down on my lap.
I need to know what book that is
React to llamas with hats 1-12. It’s one of the weirdest things Ive ever seen, besides cotton candy randy
Please make the rendered naked Rhett shirt available at the mythical store
ost is chees in sweden
They love their dogs more than is natural
#NotMyPenisDrawing
Love how Rhett does not stop munching the moment he is given snacks lol
I've never really bought a gmm shirt but gah if you guys sell that shirt as merch I'M 100% GETTING IT
This is a good show and the pups plus The shirt make everything better
2:34 yes you are
Kaffeost, cheese coffee is only eaten in the really really north of Sweden!
The new book is confusing
I havent slept yet its 5am rn for me
Sell the shirt please
Lol butt first
If Rhett knows what it is, not only will he eat it, he will like it too🤣😂😂
Are those men?
Every day notification squad like here so Rhett and link could see
Hehe the nekkid Rhett diagram/shirt is totally revenge for that nekkid Link diagram he created a while back for the What's That Body Part game.
Rhett should do the Channing Tatum pose!!!!!
No one questioned the fact Rhett said “I am moving”?
Man shes fine
I'm watching this before I take my SAT!
Is link's hair graying?
The book is Oksana, Behave by Maria Kuznetsova.
EARY BOIZZZZ
Bleak Creek release date is on my Bday October 29. I guess I have a present to by myself.
rhett and link the dog daddies
Hilarious game
17:46 SO CUTE
Only if links dog had a bow
That game needs to be played more
May I please get that t -shirt.It's not for me its for my younger sister who lives somwhere far away so you have send it to me.
I'm guessing they really want a studio to buy the rights to Bleak Creek.
Y'all are better than this.
Where can I buy that shirt?
Please just make an LTAT channel. This isn’t GMM
I want the shirt
Would wear.
Next will it rice crispy treat
Best ever
9:53 I love Rhett's honest laugh faces.
2:33...we know
I have never heard of kaffeost before. And I'm Swedish...
I swear I have never seen rehtts top teeth
When Rhett gave Barbara a raspberry 😂
0:51 should be a ringtone
I think back cover could be left blank, it doesn't need anything on it because you can put the blurb on the inner sleeve.
Rhett got surprisingly close with that last "kaffeost".
It's weird they remember the old stuff but not the things that happened like yesterday
Love Stevie!
Okay I want to know what that gay Grandma book is
Its th wrd—dooooo
In Puerto Rico we put cheese in Hot Chocolate too. Just like it’s shown on this video
Must go pre-order my book now, so I can get a free dog.
im sorry barba and jade are more important and they are the cutest
I want to be Stevie.
Link is a cornholio.
I will take the shirt
Rhett and link’s fun with the puppies is absolutely priceless.
I try really hard to listen to what Stevie is saying but i can never pay attention because im always distracted by her beauty. I wish she was my wife
Jade is such a cute babyyyy 😍
Yall need to do a Good Mythical dog's with yall's dog's.
Thumbs down for that uggo hat
Rhett was so close to that pronunciation with kaffeost
I love me some pineapple salsa
Now we know what happens when Stevie has coffee with sugar in it.
I want the shirt!
Jade is cuter than Barbara
Please make naked Rhett shirts 😂😂
Morning!
link reminds me of my grandma
"Ost" means cheese in swedish.
Yes Rhett! please come to Sweden! // Swedish person
I'm sleepy but I'll stay awake for this.
Jade is so cute.
What 
Stop
jade is the biggest mood
lookatjadeohmygod
I love your show
They have a David and a Davin,and I honestly wasn't sure they were different people and not just pronounciation differences until David came out and he wasn't Davin,as we usually just see the hands on GMM.
Like Number 50!!
Lmao at the game. So funny.
This video was the epitome of open for a surprise 😆
1:30 dogs are leaving, thank goodness
are you rhetty?
I love this blone girl. She looks so nice and acts so wierd. I love it!
i want that shirt
wow im early wtf
You were spot on with a few of the kaffeost pronunciations
I want a shirt
The doggggg
Listened to my first ep of ear biscuits gotta say it was pretty good hearing what you guys have to say. Thanks Rhett and Link
I want the shirt! Lol
I want a shirt but with link on the back.
We are like all Finnish descent here in the UP. We have squeaky cheese all the time. Juustoa! The best way is with berries on top.
love you guys I've literally been watching you guys with my sister from the very beginning I just want you guys to know that you are amazing and hilarious and you're my favourite youtube channel!
kaffe ost is in swedish
stephie looks tired today
I love when you go all sexy
3am is early... I should go sleepies
OH YEAH MR.CRABS
The “naked Rhett” shirt should be a limited signed edition numbered and sold for charity! I’d by one of 100 and pay $59.99!
you guys need to bring your socks back ;)
I'm from North Carolina 😂
I love kimchi
My mom would put that colby jack cubed cheese in her coffee... Its not bad actually.
Leipäjuusto!
You been reading again? Lol
I feel like Rhett has an ankle spanker
I really love how within the first 5 minutes of the episode Barbara goes roaming, yet the whole episode Jade just sits on Link's lap like "I'm just going to chill here, and listen in".
"Ost" is cheese in Swedish, and "Kaffe" is coffee. Kaffeost is a combined word, we kind of like combined words since "särskrivning" is one of the deadly sins. ;)
Where can I get that shirt? 😂😂😍
I pair salsa with stevie 😈😈😈
"Man-boys like this make me believe teenage boys like my brother are gay"
Towards the end jade looks embarrassed
AAAAWESOME
We would be glad to have you here, Rhett
Is this the first gmm video to ever get demonotised
So is this just the taste test channel now..
Ltat is going away and I don’t want it to😭😭😭
“I don’t get my own I get thirty percent less”
What is the name of the book Rhett read the excerpt from?? It sounds pretty interesting for people, not me, but people.
Day 235 it is now episode 35
I still do not know what FOSHO stand for
This isn't the normal gmm
My husband, myself, and both of our kids (1 and 4) LOVES kimchi. We eat it all the time. Our 4 year old begs for it. Its good stuff!!
Rhett eating the whole time is one big mood
“What? Stop.” 😂😂😂
hi 461
Jag har aldrig i hela mitt liv hört något om kaffe med ost i? Maybe that’s just me 🤷🏼‍♂️
Link @14:11
Tell Emma that my bday is 21 May I’m turning 14
Pls be part of Smosh Summer Games
Where I live is pretty common hot chocolate with cheese
what type of dog is link’s?
it’s 5 am
Rhett, my dad used to give me zerberts when I was a baby! So when you gave one to Barbara, it brought back memories of that
186
Aww, Jade’s little cute, nosey face at 4:53 when David brings out the cheese coffee reminds me of my 7 month old nosey little guy Chase (who btw IS named after GMM’s Chase) when someone brings ANY kind of food around him!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Idk if anyone knows what the epic rap battles of history are but in the one with the ninja turtles on rhett plays donetello the famous sculptor
Yo what up
Is it just me or does Link remind you of Garth from Wayne’s world
I didn't know how much I wasn't paying attention until you referenced SpongeBob. I'm laughing, but now I have to rewind.
You know you’ve made it when ur wearing a t-shirt with a picture of ur naked boss and a naked co-worker
I know this is obvious, but out of context the clips can misconstrued as something inappropriate your children shouldn’t be watching 😂 awesome and hilarious as always. Good job guys and lady.
Something that might be cool to do is you could totally do a reversible cover.  Have one side be  this and choose a second best and do it on the underside of the cover.  That would be neat
I wasnt looking at my phone when they were introducing Barbara and Jade. I was like aww they invited they're wives. Then I looked at my screen and was like oh.......
I really wonder sometimes how they were fathers before Barbra  and Jade!
I want the shirt.
How disappointing, I actually thought asparagus salsa sounded delicious
the book look like from the 60s to 70s. guy fun show have great day. Oh guys I will miss you tomorrow so have a great day.
You know there are things that are really good, so you recommend them to your friends. GMM is so hilariously GOOD that I realized I never want to share this with someone bc I. Want. It. All. For. Myself.
LOL @ the double entendres in this episode. Rhett gets more and more adult as the years go on.
Good mythical morning from California!
The release date is on my little brother's birthday!! Unfortunately he's too much of a dweeb to appreciate Good Mythical Morning...
"Kaffe ost" just means "coffee cheese"...
Changed the title?
We don't have any Salsa in My Country :'(
Did anyone come to see if anyone said anything about her saying "ass" also...
I am so cool
She reminds me of Grace
I remembered all the episodes but not there names
Phrygian cap
Will It?
In Colombia we put cheese in our hot chocolate to melt it 🤠
Link at the end signed "OHML I love you" in American Sign Language lol
Anyone else really want to try that cheese now?
Im early
My grandpa actually puts a slice of sharp cheddar cheese in the bottom of his coffee cup almost every time he drinks coffee.
Stevie should have her own podcast, I love her voice and personality
and the sound she makes when she cackles
How can Rhett move to Finland if it doesn’t exist??
What's her @
What's her @
Barbra is so funny Haha
For those interested, the book the cover is on is Oksana, Behave! according to a quick google search.
I have a crush on Stevie😍 I know she’s gay I do not care
The only cheese that should squeak is cheese curds.
I love the direction this show is taking
This coffee can't have Finnish cheese, Finland doesn't exist...
Okay, now to rewatch it and actually pay attention to stuff instead of just looking at Jade....
Do will it chocolate reheated pls
Zerbert is 100% a NC thing 😂😂😂😂😉
Barbara is the daughter Rhett never had
Are y’all obsessed with salsa lol
I’m happy 😃 that I’m erly
Speaking about T-shirts
We want "SNOT MIKE UP PUFFED HE" T-shirt
It was an episode 3 years ago called "Playing Mad Gab Game"
oh gosh
if i could have that t shirt with rhett and link on it i would hehehe
i forgot erie, indiana was a thing until she mentioned it
I thought the title said weird salads and I was happy till I saw it said salsa
SUCH A CUTE PUPPY
What! blackberry salsa?!
0:00
jokes on you!! i'm NOT commenting on this video
kimchi salsa is a thing?!?!?! I WANT!!!!!!!!!!
Thought the title of this video said weird ass salads at first. It diddnt even surprise me though.
I'm interested in the book they are reading than the book they are promoting.
Jag har aldrig hört talas om kaffeost va i helvete 😂😂 yes im swedish if that didnt give it away
What breed?
Come to the International Book Fair in México plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
In Colombia they do hot cocoa with cheese in it when the cheese melts is delicious
Kaffeost is norwegian
Kaffe=Coffee
Ost=Cheese
It’s a Fine
8:24
Nice hat...
Hi gmm
Epic
i thought they were releasing that as a new shirt and i almost lunged for my wallet
To bad Finland doesn't exist Rhett.
An infants nose 😂
I want those dogs
look how many dislikes this doesn't have. proof most people like rhett and link.
So like, hey hook me up with one of those shirts, dude I just came up with the best idea, you know the davinci drawing, have rhett and links naked bodies merged into the da vinci drawing! I would buy 8, 10 if you added the micro phallus.
I swear they changed the title of this video... That confused me so much.
i would rather she was topless
Sure am looking forward to my doxin!!
"Your weiner is the size of an infant's nose"... excuse me what
Yea....not a dog person.Kinda weird.....
I still have no idea how in the world you had the time to write a book! I mean...having a full-time job, running a company, writing music, planning a tour, having a podcast and taking care of family and kids at the same time! Please tell me you had one or two ghostwriters or for the love of god..teach me how you scheduele you time...
I tried to push it to the back of my head, but the comment Link made a few episodes ago about not being willing to pick up a friendly lost pitbull on the side of the road because he only lets Jade be with certain types of dogs really bothered me. I can't remember exactly what he said, but that was the gist of the comment he made. I think they were playing a game of some sort, but for some reason it really stuck with me, and kind of made me disappointed in him. I would have liked Link to be more open minded, and realize dogs aren't born with bad personalities and are shaped by the people around them. I love these guys, but if for some chance they happen to see this, Link  I hope you can try to rethinking some of these stereotypes about pitbulls. I believe you're an intelligent compassionate man and have maybe just been misguided. Either way, you both are good people and I appreciate all the hard work you all put into this fantastic show. ❤️ 
The "cheese with coffee" is a similar thing in other places, but its hot chocolate drink with some crackers and cheese. All hot and melting cheese on top of the crackers mixed in the hot coco drink.
Hello
Hello
Hi
Hi
Make a Lost Causes of Bleak Creek audiobook on spotify read by Rhett and Link!!
Have had that Blackberry Salsa...def NOT GOOD. And the only place around me to purchase it was this trendy farm place that  overpriced everything and that didn't help the cause either.  One of the few things I purchased but did not like and immediately tossed it (and my money) in  the trash.
What book is that
A Beavis and Butthead Do America reference in 2019? Way to keep it relevant.
I mean.....I’d wear that shirt.
ha, honestly had to laugh when you said Oct 29th, didn't know the book will be released on my birthday, it would make a great birthday gift!
The Finnish name for the squeaky cheese translates to "Bread cheese" as in, a cheese that looks kind of like a flatbread. One traditional way of having it includes baking it lightly with cream over it in an oven and served with cloudberry jam.
Oh hey new here
Wtf book did they put in there?
so weird but tasty.
What
ok
You guys should do a canadian chocolate bar taste test
Good Mythical Morning Everyone! 😊❤
😂
Lol
If the water is free from minerals it will just absorb sodium from your blood via osmosis
Can I get one😂😂
Has anyone noticed that Anthony Jeselnick has gradually change his appearance to look more like Rhett? He finally has nailed it with his Netflix special.
I've had cheese tea... At least what we here call cheese tea. It's nice.
The squeaky cheese is eaten as a desert in Finland, but I have never heard of anyone eating it actually having it in their coffee, only on the side.
I see stevie's face and I click
Coffee cheese is also known as "cheese bread" (=juustoleipä) in Finland and yes, it is delish! Google it, and then search for a local place that sells it!
13:18 When your mom walks in on you jerkin it
Yes!! Move to Sweden Rhett!!
I love Kaffeost. It's the best!
No one else noticed that shes wearing a shirt with naked Rhett and Link?
Nice.
rhett pronounced kaffeost really well actually
Could you guys do an episode where you both take a cold ice bath while eating a ghost pepper? Please do it.
Based on the book's summary on BleakCreek.com, I'm assuming this is of the YA genre, yes?
Does anyone know what that book was?
Fruit salsas are amazing over cream cheese.  Eat it with wheat thins or graham crackers!
OOF
DONT LOOK AT ME
Why do hands focus cameras? I tried searching but all I got were hands on reviews for cameras.
Yay
Just curious about Bleak Creek? Is it a real place from maybe where they originally from in North Carolina or is it something they made up?
The messy coffee table gives me SUCH anxiety
Finnish squeaky cheese is eaten with berries, the norwegian coffee cheese might be diffirent.
I'm both horrified and amused that gmm isn't as Pg as it used to be
HEY!!!! YOU ARE RELEASING YOUR BOOK ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!! COOOOOOOL!!!!
I like her condom hat.
WHERE CAN I GET THE HOODIE THAT LINK IS WEARING?!?
Columbian’s put cheese in there hot chocolate and it’s delightful!
Buying 'The Lost Causes of Bleak Creek' for my son's 13th birthday!
GOOOD MYYYYTHIIIICAAAALLL MOOOOOORRNIING!!!!
I can’t believe I’m up at 7am watching you guys
After the YMH podcast i understand why they are like this.
Will the book eventually be on Audible?
For anyone who is interested...What Stevie is talking about with the water and Sodium deficiencies. That happens when you drink water that is "too pure." Your body needs the minerals that come naturally in most waters. Drinking water that is like the water she was referring to can be quite harmful to you. The more you know!
Torille
Not sure how wise it was for a couple of guys from the South to write a book with "lost cause" in the title.
Why is Rhett just eating plain tortilla chips?
YouTube is so pathetic that they probably would demonitize them for showing a dog's stomach.
Girl: my eyes are up here

Rhett: sorry, I was looking at me on your shirt
Hey are Rhett and Link brothers
why are there always so many dislikes? LTAT is excellent every single week.
I imagine some sort of ghost writer wrote a book.
If the cheese was supposed to help their sodium deficiency, why couldn’t the Finnish people just eat the cheese alongside the coffee? And not IN it 😂
Link, baby lippin’ that spoon,  every time,  is just weird....and gross.
Please do a series of rhett and link playing sims 4
What’s ur dm??
Kaffeost in Sweden is mostly popular In the areas bordering Finland. In Finland they also like to eat it like a cake with cloudberry jam.
Why is Rhett not eating like a caveman???
I should write a book, the main character is going to be Rhett's anamorphic body.
Can we have something where every person who come to the show have to choose a ingredient (good or bad) and it builds up till the end of the season when you and josh have to cook a dish with all these ingredients?
LTAT makes me laugh so hard!
“Your wiener’s the size of an infant’s nose”
I make a darn good blueberry salsa
Hi
What if there was a dad playing with his infant saying “I got your nose” then Rhett walking by screaming “NO I GOT YOUR NOSE”

NOTIF SQUAD!
Defined one of the best videos ever, especially when the dogs get brought in.
ahhhhhhhhhhh
How's Rhett going to move to a country he doesn't believe exists?
I’m getting a bit mad over how Link handles the dog.
Holy... wtf uploaded three minutes agoo💜💜💜
The finnish squeaky cheese is called leipäjuusto, which translates to "bread cheese" :)
I'm colombian and I usually dip a piece of colombian toast with butter in my coffee 🙆

Is this show a joke? I really like the other shows but this is better on the toilet. Something to watch if you have nothing else to watch.
First
Ye
Link is the disabled kid they keep on the show for pr.
She would be a great pornstar...
bad video
dogs are gross :/
Im i the only one that feels like there has been tension building between these two for the past cpl of seasons??
good
Great Producer , yes..... presenter / host ... Meh!
Ltat is my least favorite. Just my opinion.
Am I the only one that is not a big fan of LTAT? I would rather have a regular episode..
They need a new host.
I love all of your shows except this show every week, not funny not nothing. Stop it
link is just so link today and you can tell rhett is just exhausted lol
I’m pretty sure that you didn’t use a Japanese peach, which is easier to peel
About the pineapple, it’s not doable with any variety. Actually, it’s a very specific kind. Here in Brazil we call it Abacaxi Gomo de Mel, what would translate to something like Honey Slice Pineapple.
I think you may have a more broad definition of fruit than the rest of us
Expectation: Link bites the kiwi
Reality: Link inhales the kiwi
Link: touches sharp object





Rhett (in fear): I’ll do this
“We try fruit peeling” casually throws in a chicken and a nerf football. I love this show.
Don't say "come on babe" while you push open a peach and it starts dripping
it's uncomforable
This videos execution was absolutely horrendous but it might have been one of the funniest gmm videos I have watched
I think you used the wrong type of peach.
This segment was a painful presentation of Expectation vs. Reality.
I love how each time they’re thinking something inappropriate Rhett looks at his staff for conformation 💀
Never thought I’d see a Kangaroo getting a vasectomy
😒Can you imagine if these two were in an office building in an actual office and hearing some of there conversations as you walk by? Lol
🥝 The kiwi part is by far the best!!! Not only did I learn a valuable life hack..... it was hilarious 😂 links face when he ate it...omg
Sucking the kiwi made up for the failed peach 
attempt
what kind of party involves peeling chicken
Rhett: Here

Link: inhales kiwi
Okay but who peels a peach before eating it?
Link just ate a kangaroos nuts 
team edge writes that down
5:59 
The proper way to eat a kiwi, how elegant
My immediate reaction to the title was
"Don't give link any peeling utensils"
9:23
What my priest told me the last time I went to confession.
German sordiers in WW2 be like:
13:58
the most satisfying part of this video was link eating the kiwi whole
"Every time I look at a kangaroo, I look at its undercarriage" ~Link 2019
I LOVE how much they don't trust Link with anything sharp
This episode doesn’t seem planned.
"I love peeling. Computer screens, new fridges, sunburnt backs."
the skin fic has entered the chat
The leaking of the peach was rather graphic. I'm feeling slightly uncomfortable....
Not cool that you guys couldn't do the peach but the crew did and you wouldn't put it on the regular show 😐
"Peel de kiwi.... wida spoon"
Yes. Because that’s how surgeries are performed. You just yank on organs until they detach. 😂
Nobody:

Gmm: L E T S P E E L A F O O T B A L
the most satisfying part of it was somehow Link's way of eating a kiwi #hesdoneitagain 
😂😂
This is two men slowly losing their minds.....
Just don't tell anybody you SCORED with the chicken...
It makes me uncomfortable how Link always tries to touch sharp objects like this electric knife
A chicken is a fruit this is more unexpected then a tomato being a fruit
8:32 two men mutilate a pineapple... I'd watch that
Link: u dont wanna be too close to the edge...
Me: u don't wanna be too close to that knife... 😬
It's only a matter of time until Rhett uses a chainsaw and Link just grabs the blade while it's in use.
GMM must do a collab episode with @Simplynailogical in order to bond over peeling things!!! please make this happen!
For the peach hack, they are not ripe when the guy peeled them,he just did it for visual satisfaction.
That's a nectarine in the original video that's why it didn't work 😆
Nobody:
Not a single soul:

Peeling sun burnt backs. LMAO, look at Rett's face at 0:30
Rhetts' face when he says sun burnt back
Rhett’s face when Link mentioned peeling sunburnt backs was everything 😂😂
I found  this fruit peeling video satisfying  after a rough day. GMM always makes me smile.

You guys/crew are awesome.
This episode was extremely anticlimactic, but it also had a strong Season 6 vibe. I love it.
This video was very apeeling.
I subbed I've been watching since 2017. (Btw nice fruit song lol)
I do not recall my parents signing the permission slip for this peel trip
chicken is now fruit lol and apparently a football is too
"The Most Unsatisfying Video on The Internet" 


I fixed the title.
14mins 56sec of Link mico managing Rhett .. 😂😂🙈
4:26 Dodecahedron's aren't satisfying 
thank's Rhett, you made my D12's cry...
Rhett with a modified electric knife isnt as stressful as Link sticking his fingers so closely to someone operating anything other than a spoon
drinking game: take a shot every time someone says "satisfying" :D
i
t's not in all kinds of pineapple that that will work
Jif is a brand of peanut butter. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ah yes the chicken my favorite fruit
Depending on which part of Florida you go, you can peel both sunburnt backs and fruits at the same time.
I agree I tried this the other day and It was not as easy as it seems on the pineapple
"peeling the fruits "
CHICKEN
@link: try watching nailpolish peeling  aka peelporn by Simplynailogical - very statisfying
did you know that you can peel a dragon fruit in one go, its pretty satisfying
I loved how Rhett looked at Link when he said 
" sun burnt backs "
you have to do the pineapple from the top, break the leaves first! I've done it
Boiled peach not fresh
When did a chicken become a fruit? 😂
you can do this with rillos and its pretty satisfying.
13:53 yeah this show's been going on for a while now hasn't it...
Peel a kiwi
With a spoon
🥝 🥄
Weird guy on Tik Tok Successfully peels a pineapple with his bare hands. 
Everyone: Amazed


Rhett tries and fails. Everyone: Amazed
The peach peeling was uncomfortable
Link: “sun burnt backs”
Rett: “👀”
Didn't know chicken was a fruit.
They spelled here wrong 🤣😂
This channel never changed it's style. Reason why they remain successful.
I’m  pretty sure with the pineapple is has to be extremely overripe for it to work
don't say OoOOoOoHh say AhHHhHh hahaha I busted up laughing. this made my day.
2:52 I really thought the leaking was special effects..nope!
We try fruit peeling


Chicken..
Oh gosh. That football elbow pad is going to be on 5 minute Crafts soon 🤦🏼‍♀️
This was a very aPEELing video. 🤣🤣🤣
As a guy the kiwi-testacle comparidon made it uncomfirtable in my nethers
So yeah.
"These kiwis look like kangaroos ballsacks" lmfao😂
Great. Now I'm craving fruit...
I thought Link earned his sharp thing privileges back when he sabred the Champagne so well.
Link inhaling a kiwi is something I never knew I needed
Chicken = fruit? what NERF =FRUIT is my life a lie
i miss when your game title/intro was improvised and silly (sillier)
The Peach Splitting Daddies & their trusty sidekick, AAAAAAAHHHHpple man
Ah yes, my favorite segment, WGSFIH (SF!) WTOATP, IAGSS, WGTTPO
Me: (shows this video to my grandma)
Grandma: Oh, this reminds me of your father when he was younger...
Did anyone else laugh at peach 🍑 crack lol
This is not family friendly 😂
Overripe? That pineapple is still green
The Nelly remix had good energy/delivery and was very on key...nice lol
Link, please don't point at that electric knife. It makes me anxious.
Ive done the peach one and they didn't get the peach hot enough at first
I feel like I hallucinated this episode
The opening song rock. I love the duets  extra cool.
Link and his kiwis
5:58
7:46
Then... this
Replace peel with skin in the opening game jingle
Y’all never peel a kiwi with a spoon?
Link: i keep thinking its bread 
Rhett: IT IS BREAD
The pineapple used on the video is special. This is a fruit developed in a brazilian university, it is more sweet and smaller. due to its lack of capacity to resist to some plagues, it''s not produced on large scale.
Fruits:

Kiwi

Watermelon

Pineapple

Chicken
No ones appreciate the way they make the singing intro remixes, it’s amazing. 😁🤷‍♂️
You want satisfying, watch a professional skin a deer. It’s kinda awesome. And no blood
did link say jif instead of gif
Pulling crispy skin of a cooked chicken is extremely satisfying, should have done that instead.
They need an official talk show😂💖
This is an entirely family appropriate channel
Who peels a peach?
3:50 
Captions: (link sighs pleasurably)
You guys. I feel like GMM is just kind of devolving into Link being odd and Rhett giving disapproving looks. Keep it up. :D
I liked that they added a mini recap clip at 14:13 ☺️
0:31
*visible confusion*
They made me SO NERVOUS with that electric knife!
When two forty year old men are cooler than you.
You should do like pirate foods or play sea of thieves I think you would like it
10:32 MS. BEAN?!
"And you give this to the neighbors..."😂
I was on my way to close the app when I heard you're cutting a Nerf Football.... 🤔🤔 I'm listening
pineapple was way not ripe enough XD
Mood: "Remember when I did the kiwi and it worked perfectly?"
Eet tha keewee wiv a spoon 😂😂
What you did with the chicken(boiling then ice bath) is how you peel the peach.

Also the pineapple trick needs a specific type of pineapple
Just 3 minutes in Rhett: It's a pretty good peach 😂😂😂😂 was expecting that by now tho
There's a cutting board with the GMM logo on it. Is there anything in that studio that does not have the logo on it?
Gif stands for graphics interchange format so why would you jif if you don't say jraphics lol
Link: sunburned backs...
Rhett: wtf
Ah yes, because the BEST fruit is a nerf football, am I right?
I tried it will a yellowed pineapple too and 100% does not work lmao
You guys have posted 1,750 videos on youtube! You guys have made so much progress since January 9th 2012. Keep going you guys are doing amazing!!
Chickens are fruit i knew it!!!
Title: peeling fruit

Rhett and link: chicken
I love your videos🤩
I really appreciate this trend of indulging Link 👍👍
Listen, your bank accs must be insane. Hopefully i can follow the trend soon
11:38 
My heart skipped a beat when his finger was close to the electric knife. Stop this man.
Chicken? It’s called fruit peeling!
Ah yes my favourite fruit nerf footballs
So chicken is a fruit?
Interesting.
As soon as Rhett send let's watch the satisfying video at about cats popped up
I found this very a-peel-ing...
Nobody:

Captions:  F U N K Y  M U S I C
What kind of sadistic freak peels peaches and kiwis?
I love the way Rhett looked at link like “wtf is wrong with you” for a bit after link said he liked peeling sunburnt backs
No one:
Not a single soul:
Link: J I F
Link pointing to the end of the modified electric knife gives me major anxiety
In the middle of watching - Why am I watching it?!
Finished watching- what did i just watch!?
Gotta go back to basics. I WANT BLIND FOLDS!
so much wrong with 2:08 onward...spreading...
You have to get the right pineapple. It's a specific type called a Snack Pineapple
Close your eyes and listen... 13:20
I still don't understand how anything is satisfying
The show had gotten more explicit and I live for that
Nerf football peeling was epic 😂😂😂
Most things are unsatisfying when link is yelling “wait wait watch that edge”
And link used think coconut was the end of the world
Rhett and Link: This doesn't work like that


Thanos: Reality often is disappointing
Link: his thumbs are sweaty 
Brother: barging through the door KNEES WEAK, ARMS ARE HEAVY
Me:SHUT UPPP
Link looked so disappointed when Rhett couldn't get that peach peeled 😅
NOO!!! But I'M JACY!
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!!
You should do one on starfruit
The kiwi one is how I do it every time 🤷🏻‍♀️
I read the title as “Ultimate Satisfying Peeing Experiment”... it wouldn’t surprise me if that was correct
You're the best guys like always keep it up
As a fan of Call Me By Your Name, that part with the peaches made me very uncomfortable...😬😳




(If you get the reference, I love you.)
Link is just continuously a control freak, year after year
Link: you know Rhett, you'd be a good surgeon
* 5 minutes later *
 Rhett: you gotta find the baby, and dislocate it
Link flopped over the desk and Rhett looks at him like wtf
hahah
Fruit peeling? 
Why not just eat fruit the Sea of Thieves style and magically scarf it down in 2 bites!
The game intro song is IMO the best one so far.
The plural of fruit is fruit.... just sayin'.
Link breaks peach "aaaaahhhh😰"
Rhett "taste it "😂😂
Link " I'm disappointed let's forget this ever happened "
New intro?! I haven't watched this channel in over two years.. I've missed so much.
5:54 Anyone else think that was satisfying????
"We have insertion"
Link can stress a lot
Is this why link called all of us “sweet peaches” on twitter 😂
the subtitles of the intro music say groovy intro music so true :)
:( why did you change your intro? i miss the old one! ima cry :(
The video of the guy peeling the peach looked like someone's skull getting peeled. And did who peels peaches?
I'm 💀💀 laughing @ 6:00 I can't deal!!!!!!
thank you so so much for helping me get through my all nighter working on final projects and papers❤️good mythical morning!🥰☀️
Simplynailogical should of been on this. She knows how to peel.
Anyone else here think of Cristine on SimplyNailLogical when they heard "satisfying peel"? lol
Anybody... want chicken? 🤣🤣🤣
because chicken is clearly a fruit
Fun fact: a pineapple is actually a collection of berries.
"Gotta get some leverage." Rhett-2019
A banana is supposed to be split into 3 natural pieces
Y’all should bring back Damnyell an Richard😂
Peaches need to be with sirtain sort or maybe greener... Fatscined... Sort and age.
Who actually watches this in the morning?
"Fruit in here"
CLAIMED BY UMG
9:06 when he’s a foot deep 

Pause at the time
My mouth has been watering the whole time they were pealing
Sunburned back peeling tho 😫
You guys should do the labor pain stimulator for mother's day!!
I really need a gif of Link and that Kiwi now. Damn. DAMN boy.
@3:15 he made that pusi cry ;p
Rhett being very concerned for Link's ability to balance 10:55 - 11:03
Nobody:
Link:these kiwis look like kangaroo ballsacks
A chicken is not a fruit
rhetts face when link said sunburnt backs was my WHOLE mood
I seen too much BL... And the leaking juice from the peach... Made my imagination run wild 😏😏😏
Remake the unicorn rap
Nobody: 




Rhett and Link: WE PEELED A NERF FOOTBALL!
Since when is a chicken a fruit?
Because 10-20 second clips show everything that happened, including the prep and all the countless failures...
chicken is my favourite fruit
Idk if it’s just me or I knew about the pineapple thing my whole life. My dad taught me this
Remember when I did the kiwi and it worked perfectly!!!!!
I thought everybody peels kiwis with spoons?
link instantly lost 12 respect points when he said "jif"
Expectation vs. Reality that knife tho Gordon Ramsay isn't happy
link thinking that pineapple was overripe is the least satisfying part.
I wanna see them singing that intro without the animation 🤣
0:55 aye that was actually lit 😂
chicken is my favourite fruit
ayee the song they used got me jamming 😂😂
what if they pre-peeled the peach
The pineapple you need is snacking pineapple idk if you actually have that or not.
Rhett and Link. Spill the pee on their table and then, a bit later, eat fruits from it. Perfection %)))
Slashing through a group of ninjas like fruit ooopps 😂😂
You have to freeze the peach first and then rinse with cold water.
The one with the glasses is the star and the other guy is his handler. Lol its perfect. 🥝
IntroFail (trademark)
The Nelly intro card song tho😂😂
I think Cristine just had a orgasm
you guys need to roll the pineapple first, it loosens up the segments
The pineapple thing only works on a specific type of pineapple... do your research mythical team lol
rhett and link have been even funnier recently, i love them sm!
Link: I love peeling new computer screens, new fridges, sunburnt backs
Rhett: 00:31
I am Amlie. I eat a kiwi with a spoon, Amelie.
This laser disk is gigantic, I can see over the edge, Amelie. ... Hello!
We need a Rhett and Link: After Dark.
5:59 OMG hahaha. This made me laugh so hard 😂
I’m vegan

8:46




🙂🔫
I think the peach is too ripe
I didn't know a whole chicken was considered a fruit.
10:59
Are those red wing boots?
8:05 Look how they massacred my boi..
I thought everybody eat kiwi with a spoon 🤷‍♀️ anyways I always did  the only difference i cut it in half  first
Look at dem peach's drip LMAO
13:59 very questionable arm
I was under the impression link earned the right to finally use a knife
This episode was really funny, and I enjoyed the theme song too!
I think this is the most unsatisfying satisfying video I've ever watched.



but I still ♡ you guys~
anti- satisfying!
chiken. my favorite fruit.
HOLD ON DIPSTICK - YOU MESSIN WITH MY TRUCK
seriously, do a putting weird things in a crockpot
That call back at 3:43 I was amazed because that’s my favorite GMM moment
I can peaches all the time, you actually should NOT pre-split it, and you want them to be a little warm still, actually.
U’d need the good quality large ripe japanese peach to make it work
Wait a min the dude with the glasses is the creator of hulk XD
Omg that song in the beginning was so funny. Had to replay it 3 times lol
SimplyNailLogical would have been good for this segment because of her nail peelings..idk
Link is on 💉💉💊💊
I dunno, but between this and the more video... Link just seems sexually frustrated to me ... 🤷
i really can't wait for the LTAT in which live footage of this game's a cappella was recorded


i wasn't expecting rhett to join link in the falsetto at the end!


no: i'm not commenting on any other part of the video.
i'll be satisfied to let you guys who hadn't yet watched, experience the shenanigans for yourself.


🍑
remember neighborhood nimrods season 12
Link is taking cutting that football way too seriously!
That was cool stuff thanks for sharing and trying and keeping Link far away from that electric knife lo!!
"we got some fruit in here" was too funny
Pineapple was definitely too ripe lol
Pretty sure the peach in the satisfying video is underripe, then blanched, and the dude probably sliced along the crack first.
I didn't know a chicken was a fruit
This episode needs one of the og animations for all the innuendos made
The pineapple thing doesn't work
the name of the game ❤️👌🏿🥰😌
wrong kind of peaches. lol
The peach thing is with a certain Japanese peach
Nobody:


Link: 13:58
Watching Rhett and Link finger fruits is oddly satisfying.
The peach moment 😂😂
If you know the movie Call Me By Your name you’ll understand why I’m crying of laughter 😂😂
The peach thing only works with a certain type of peach.
The pineapple wasnt satisfying but was satisfying was when rhett stuck the pineaplle under is moustache
The peels definently give the feels
Do you ever just think about something and Link just does it?
i looked the pinapple one up a while ago and there are certain pineapples that are grown to peel
I really liked the singing 😂
rhett & link try to peel peach but it won't peel 
they try again & they just split the peach in half
that peach represents me xD
I miss the original intro 💔
Sick stickers bruh, where'd you get em? Mythical.store bruh. So sick bruh. Totally bruh, i just put em all over ma board bruh. So sick bruh. Yeah
Jungkook could easily peel a pineapple with his hands
thumbs down for calling gif, jif
Ah yes, my favorite fruit: a whole chicken
The most satisfying thing about this video was probably the theme for the game! Played it multiple times lmao
Rhett’s expression when Link says “sunburnt backs”... 😂
Nah Kiwis look more like tarantula abdomens
Peeling the peach it showed they put a slice in peach with knife.
11:12 I knew this was coming as soon as link put the first one on his head lol
to peel a pineapple, there is a certain variety of pineapple that works for that
I ate a pizza





With a spoon
Chicken is my favourite fruit
"Fruit Peeling" peels chicken
Emmymadeinjapan did the pineapple and it worked great! Maybe hers wasn’t as ripe. Also, you should totally have her on the show. Her channel is great!!
Link... it is pronounced gif
6:00 very satisfying lol
Best episode in a while 😂 tbh
loved link climbing over the table lolz
Pineapple "peel" only works with the Snack Pineapple variety, also known as a "Bogor" variety pineapple.
its the wrong type of peach lmao
The Kiwi was amazing
This is an old trend
U just stripped a chicken😂 and ive tried the pineapple one and it worked but thats because u have to use the right pineapple. Its called a snack pineapple.
The chicken part just feels wrong
Everyone else: Oh Oh Oh a Kangaroo
You: Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhhhhhhh that’s a nice undercarriage
Hopefully Link never gets a job at any zoo. 😂
You guys should do a Culvers taste test since Culvers is like only in the Midwest!!
miss the old intro :(
Link: YOUR PALMS ARE SWEATY
Rhett: MOM'S SPAGHETTI (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
i was really hoping you guys would cut to the apple splitting
Most satisfying....Link eating the 🥝 kiwi
Só de pensar que aqui no Brasil kiwi e tão caro nunca iria descascar assim
Kiwi method really old
Really gonna make me sift thru and find the other video just to see the same exact peach trick? Lmfao ok...
Oh yes my favourite fruit, the chicken
Im allergic to pineapples
I am asking questions
I really feel like eating pineapple now 😂😂
So the pineapple didn't work because it's a special kind of pineapple they peel in the video 🍍
Nice technique teach me how to slurp a kiwi like that 😋
Anyone elses get turned on by the way the peach was dripping
Rhetts reaction to link at 0:30 is everything
"yeah ok it looks like a testicle" - Rhett 2k19
Rhett: there is a more satisfying way. Take a look

YouTube algorithm: detective pikachu freeze frame action sequence trailer

Me: this is oddly satisfying
I kinda like the song tho
Watching Link stuck in that kiwi was amazing.
When I first saw the picture I thought you were going to ask the age old question of will it pineapple😂
pineapple needs to be a golden pineapple  not the regular type
I half expected the inside of the Nerf football to be air on the inside and to have Link's glasses hiding in it....
Wrong series, lol.
The pineapple one is actually a special type of pineapple called snack pineapple
2:18 KNEES ARMS ARE HEAVY. THERE'S VOMIT ON HIS SWEATER ALREADY, MOM'S SPAGHETTI
Yes, Link. I'm always ready.
i heard somewhere that the peach was a specific type of peach from japan. could be why it didnt work
11:26 this is not family friendly 😂
Link what? 😂 11:11
He just shoved his arm through the self proclaimed birth canal IM DED
Freaking Rhett though 😂😂😂😂
I'm loving Link even more today 😂 he's so happy
Link Would Have Joy If He Used The Electric Knife.....
Mmm... Chicken, my favorite fruit.
Kiwi skin is delicious
We need more expectation vs reality. I need to see more of the truth!
We try peeling fruit. Heres us peeling va chicken too
Best song for a game you’ve ever made yet! 😂
I heard Rhett sksksk and i lost it
You have entertained me on the toilet
You said Gif wrong, you said Gif it is pronounced Gif big difference
Would wager the peach in the video was blanched very briefly.
Links hair!!!
Wait did they just make a video just on peeling fruit?
Would wager the peach in the video was blanched very briefly.
You should see if you can get Paul McCartney on this show 

Please I’ll do anything
Your peach went pee Pee. Lmao
You should watch Emmymadeinjapan's video of the pineapple trick. She fails at first, but is then able to do it.
Theres a mutant pinapple that works better for that kind of peeling, the Abacaxi Gomo de Mel
I love the reaction on Link's face when he was peeling that chicken!!  LOL.
I came for the pineapple and left unsatisfied! Lol
Ultimate satisfying peeling experiment
Go to your other intro
in the original peach video he use a japanese peach
"Ohh yeA... Roll it back... Oh yEa... Oooh, now you're cookin'... rRolll it back..."
14:13 i appreciate the comparison shot
Notification/ Early Squad Where You At?!!❤️
Did you guys ever consider being vegetarians/vegans, and if one or both of you would, how would you deal with that on the show? #earbuiscuits #ama
ayyyeeee you’re trending!!
4:49 AAAAAAHASHAHAHAAAAHAAAAAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG HES GOT A SPOON 🥄 








comment if you know what I’m referencing
I must've changed. This was minimally entertaining.
Rhett and Link's GMM doesn't feel the same to me. It feels like there's chemistry or passion missing or something.
i will never be able to eat a kiwi again
Watching king of random huh?
What happened to Link winning back knife privileges from Slow Mo guys collab???
"I think our pineapple is overripe" pineapple is fuccing green
Good mythical morning, guys! It's mid day here in Norway, but it fits perfectly with the fact that I have a lunch break right about now 👌 keep up the awesome work, guys!
9:13 vegans that is for you
theyre fruitlets, pineapples are berries.
id also say an under-ripe pineapple would work better

Yet again, another video that would have benefited from simplynailogical ... she is the peely queen!
you need to blanch the peach first.
demon phannies squealing at the mention of peeling a sunburnt back
None of this satisfying stuff as ever been satisfying. Just ready for it to be over.
Where my Call Me by Your Name fans at?
i dislike because of how he pronounced gif
:20 ... did link just call a JIF?
worldwide pineapple is called ANANAS and in the USA pineapple
Ummmm....... So chickens a fruit now???
Good morning
“Eat the kiwi with a spoon “😂😂😂amazing
That image of boiled chicken skin peeling is... evocative. 👀
The original video must have cut the pineapple around the core as well. They should show how they actually did it.
13 sided 3 dimensional figure.
To be fair, this is like FBE eating it wrong
They've never done the peach thing before? I've done that multiple times.
oh man i gotta try that kiwi trick!!
AND PEEW A KIWI WIV A SBOON
Nerf...unsatisfying
Computer screen peeling
I think it’s funny how if all the people who are there link is the one telling rhet about safety 😂
Link, please wear a belt...
That one guy who is subbed just to dislike immediately
Pineapple is just a fruit made of fruits
The pineapple in the video is a rare kind that's actually not very popular because it is hard to grow.
Is chicken even a fruit?
Dear Rhett and Link,
Aaahh i love you guys so much i have been with you since the beginning. I love your videos they make able to get through the day.☺❤💥
Much love,
Your boggest fan lily
episode felt like an obligation
14:07....im a skate boarder
I herd Rhett scretching at meh and was loik 




AHHhhhHhhHhaHhhhhHHHHHhHH
The best way to peel a fruit....road rash 😏
Peeling experience 😂
I like how Rhett didn’t trust Link with the knife😂
#11 on trending street
Chicken is a fruit?
The pineapple.LOOKS like it was cooked on a grill or warmed thru in some type of way
An elbow pad for his weenis!!!!
I am so uncomfortable.
Go to 13:59 and it is confirmed, Link is a Nerf Natzi
Link: Remember when I did the kiwi and it worked perfectly? ... lol love it.
wrong variety of peach.
I say let Link use sharp things now.. because to be fair to Link he did manage to saber a champagne bottle perfectly with the Slo Mo guys.
Peach peel from bottom not top. Lol. Come on man
Link said gif wrong right at the start and I was distracted thinking about it for the whole episode.
Josh..what up with that knife ..bring them to my kitchen and I'll sharpen them for u..Coffee Cup in Pensacola..oldest dinner in town 74 years strong and we didn't get there on full knives
Burnt backs?
I have that mug!!!
Collab with Raphael gomes!!! And mention me ;) ❤️
This dude really just said “jif”
It's the kind of peach he used too
Use extremely under ripe fruits so they are hard. That's the trick
The game intro song made me rewind at least 10 times
Way easier to peel a chicken when it's raw
Got here before the 24 hour mark
@vegans chicken is a fruit
hold on guys watch this
*peels chicken*
everyone else: :O
i got very uncomfortable watching Rhett try to peel a peach lol
you spelled 'here' wrong :P
Y'all were holding the peach upside down
Don't use the sh*t Wal-Mart peaches. You need the farmers market peaches that require a bib.
Am i the only one who read “Ultimate satisfying peeing experiment”? 😂😂
3:51 with captions, "Link sighs pleasurably"
Can’t cheat if there’s no rule link
your kangaroo nut's leaking
The peaches were too ripe, probably too soft
I was terrified Link was going to touch the business end of that operating electric knife
MFW it's Nerf or nothin
I knew Link was going to do that with the football
Always watching how close Link's finger got to the electric knife
13:59 looks perfectly normal
@7:44 - Link, your accent is showing. FTR, North Carolinian here, about an hour away from where you grew up. 



 ;)
for the pineapple, it only works with a specific species of pineapple, which isn't the ones in the u.s.
7:54 hahahah! I listened to it without looking at it so idk it sounded so weird
GM! It looked like a nectarine in the very 1st video!
In the last year or 2, this show has gone from rated G, to a solid PG. 😂
Shoulda got key and peele for this video!!!!!!
Dear Link,

I think Dana Carvery might be your bio dad.  It's uncanny.
0:55 best cover ever
You know what time it is lunchtime
When Rhett was trying to peel the peach, it felt VERY wrong
Chicken is now a fruit guys
Rhett being a pervert about the peach is golden
Now you have me wondering what pineapple I've eaten... On several occasions it peeled super easy.
13:13 so supportive 😂
Did he just say.......JIFS??????
ITS GIFS NEIL! lol
Nice to see the good old format
The unsatisfying thing is how they just let the juice drip onto the table...
When you're at a family reunion 10:19
I have peeled a kiwi fruit in this fashion. I am also one of those fiends that eats the skin of a kiwi fruit.
What's that intro song? 1:00
FYI you need specific type of pineapple if u wanna peel it like in tiktok vid
Tasty did the peach peel trick. I think youre using peacehs that are too ripe
Soooooo, people peeling fruit makes it on trending?
The only good thing about having sleep insomnia
LInk: Peeling backs
Rhett: ??????
Me*noticed* that I was watching at Night
Puneet use unit use knife
This entire video was oddly sensual
FIRST 




Friday of May 🌻
This whole video was oddly sensual
You have to use a certain type of pineapple.
I realized when Link put the Nerf end on him, that he looks like Timmy Turner.
chicken is a fruit
Im p sure u need a special type of peach that u can do it with
Links excitement when he ate the kiwi 🥝
Pineapple too green.
r/ that peeling feeling
if ur here for the pineapple , 6:19
21 seconds!
Link telling Rhett how to cut that football is like my mom telling my dad how to drive.
Who needs a peeled peach?
You have the wrong pineapple, the pineapple you need is called the snack pineapple
"pineapple on pizza joke"
wait, people peel kiwi? Why not just cut into quarters?
I thought that's how everyone peeled a kiwi...
5:07 Rhett: "Yeah. Okay, it looks like a testicle."
Do another "would you rather"!
ok but jongho from ateez can split an apple in half with his bare hands while singing so
Those peels gave me feels
sad-isfying
Peaches still have to be warm. I do mine like that all the time.
2:10 I just got flashbacks to call me by your name
There was something...satisfying...about watching Rhett try to peel that peach. #zaddy
This is officially my favorite episode
Here's an idea: testing the most unsatisfying things
banger intro
I’ve been living a life of lies
5:55 is my favorite part
If Rhett quits the show we will instantly know that it's because of link
You guys should do will it chicken and waffles
Arent green pineapples un ripe?
Once again, I’m liking for the intro song alone. Absolute perfection.
0:20 - pasta extrusion WHAT?
Watching you mutilate that football was painful and also terrifying!
That pineapple wasnt ripe. Theyre gold when ripe not green
The peaches only remind me of Call Me By Your Name...
Tip of the day: Drinking water while watching this video is a mistake. It made me choke.
The kiwi was the most satisfying one
i though everyone peeled their kiwis with spoons?
Japanese and Korean peaches can do that. But they are extremely expensive
I’m pretty sure the peach shouldn’t be ripe. But idk
Lol sunburn backs 😂😂😂😂 rhett's giving link the look.
Tried the pineapple thing with a fully ripe one and it was messy and definitely not satisfying. Maybe I needed to visualize kangaroo testicles?
I think Rhett and Link are just slowly losing their sanity
4:52 to 6:02 funny not pg lol keeping it clean xD
You have to blanch the peach first
LINK STOP POINTING YOUR FINGER AT THE ELECTRIC KNIFE. At least that what I would have said lol
😂😂😂😂😂 intro song
I keep waiting for the Call Me By Your Name jokes...
The peach thing looks so bad 😂😂
You know there are diferent types of peaches?
you had to boil the peach
I thonk its a certain type of peach and its probably not ripe so the fruit is firmer
4:41 immediately takes the knife away from link lol
Link being Link can be too much Link for me lol
diff type of peach makes a diff
I tried to do the pineapple thing and it didn’t work for me at all!!
Looking forward to the peels!!!!!
Chase is never gonna live down his Apple splitting "ahhh" is he?
We all have split Apple at some point...😑
Did...did he say jifs?!
Hey Denver
I've been watching you guys for years!
The only satisfying thing in this video was the way Link at that kiwi
the pineapple one works if the pineapple is very ripe
Guuuys he steamed his peach lmao
Did Link say jiff instead of gif?
Wow I just peeled an avocado before seeing this vid.... yes. Yes it was a satisfying peel.
I don't think they blanched the peaches properly
“We got the peels to give you the feels”
Peeling the bottom of the barrel in one satisfying motion
Link's shoes are always good 😎 big likes
Yeet I'm early...but sad I have nothing of significance to comment because I haven't watched the episode yet...
peel the kiwi with a spoon
The peach was too ripe, that's why.
0:30 Rhett’s face 😂
Have you seen simplynailslogical's peel p0rn? It's the best!  Hahah
Best part of waking up Rhett and Link in your YouTube notifications
I was with you until you said sunburnt skin. 🤢
I bet those fruits were organic
First of all who peels a peach?
honestly, i love eating the skin on chicken wings
that peach is giving me cmbyn flashbacks and I’m not okay
Asmr is getting weird, man…
Dudes the plural of fruit is fruit NOT fruits
make complete songs like that one 1:00
9:12 look at the title ITS A CHICKEN
I love Rhett . He makes me laugh so effortlessly
this episode felt like @youresoloud in real life
hide this before crafty sees it and makes a diy knee and elbow padding video
Am i the only person that eats all peelings. I like grape fruit peelings the best 😍
Link is soo ruin’t to satisfying videos!!! It’s ALL in his face!!!! 😖😖😖
you need to pre cut the pineapple by its grooves before tearing it
2:14 palms are sweaty knees weak  arms are heavy
When you blanch a peach, it needs to be peeled while still warm.
Lol this makes me sad I'm allergic to pineapple
“Two men mutilate a pineapple” Rhett 2019 😂 8:34
uuuuhhhhhhh this was frustrating lol. fail
He probably ran his nails  across the middle where it would split, just to start the process.
Link peeling that kiwi, not satisfying, Link eating that kiwi hilarious
Would roasting the chicken not have worked better?
imagine getting millions of views to peel fruit. shocking, really
I love you guyssssssss❤
IVE NEVER SEEN AN ELECTRIC KNIFE
Rhett looks like Robert Downey Jr. mixed with Chris Pratt
you using wrong type of pineapple ,that's why. It only works with a special variety of pineapple.
What an ApPEALING video 😄👌
I've been eating kiwis that way since I was a little kid, lol
Lmfao at kangaroo ballsack. Most random moment during this segment
bring back supernote challenge
Today we got the peels to give the feels 😂
P E E L I N G
can someone explain me wheel of mythicality and how do you get to say its time to spin the wheal of mythicality
Am I the only one that ships them?
i read “peeling” and “peeing” and got very confused and concerned
Did Link just get jealous of a peach 😂😂

*At 2:24
kiwi make me go wee wee
i'm gonna need to see the unedited singing takes for this episode
Get Paul McCartney on your show
13:59 Heil...
11 people missed the like button facepalm

Early ^•^
we got sum fruit in herre
You probably need a clingstone peach, not a freestone peach
Will it wheat thin?!
They used as peacock kind of pineapple
I miss when we had access to all gmm video content for free.
Its gif not jif
Downvoted for saying "jif"
You peel a peach?!?!?
Watching this at night.  It feels so wrong... 😖
why would you peel a chicken? The skin is probably the best part.
The pinapple didn't work because they probably didn't use the right kind of pinapple (yeah, there's more than one kind). In Brazil we call it "honey comb pinapple"
Jifs? oh my god i though link is better than that
These a r e fruits not Random stuff
If this is all fruit then my next meal will be chicken and nerf
No one:



Link: 

😆♥️
I WANT SMOSH BACK
PSA: THIS IS NOT A RIPE PINEAPPLE
I think it matters what kind of peach it is
That pineapple thing is a special species of pineaple from Brazil, youre welcome
Gooood Mythical Morning✅ Notification squaaadd‼️
Its an OVER RIPE PINEAPPLE! Why doesn't anyone get that! The pineapple has to be soft
Another peeling one that’s amazing is resin. I sit and watch demolding videos every night
0:55 video starts
This made me sad because I can't have kiwi
6 views, 21 comments 

Let’s have a round of applause for youtube





Yes, I liked my own comment bc ik no one else will
4:18 gmm got microtransactions now lol
0:30 RETT’S FACE!!!!
I thought their intro song should have been "Peelings  Whooh oooh ooh Peelings Whooh ooh ooh Peelings"
5:51 did link say sh*t?
The chicken has been boiled for safety
Noticed that Rhett never lets Link ever hold a knife.
peeling a chicken is a southern sin
Peeling a pineapple isn't new, well not new in certain tropical locations.
That pineapple is not ripe..
I have watched all of your videos from the very beginning. I love you guys so much.  Like if you agree
Chase is so cute I can't 🥰
I thought this was a pretty dull episode
13:12 i think he meant dislodge
I think you are using the wrong variety of peach.
Never been this early wow
The best part of this was the intro song like oh my gosh Rhett and link should become pop artists
The chicken cracked me!
Is it sad that whenever I watch them make an innuendo, I think “well that’s gonna end up on a yoursoloud video”?
9:14 They remind me of the Angry Beavers haha
Where's the Notification Squad at?
So a chicken is a fruit 

This means I can eat a lot of fruit!
Was that chicken organic and cage free?
there is no chemistry at all between these two guys
for the peach one, you have to blanch them.. like when you peel tomato skin they must be blanched to do so.
Hope you have an amazing day today!! 😃
13:58 when mein fuher graces me with his presence
11:25 Listen with your eyes closed
Thumbs up just for the jingle
First like and good mythical Friday beasts!
5:51 what did he just darn tootin say?
Totally Trendy
Was link wearing Thorogood Boots?
Link is a phony HE HAS LEGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First like and good mythical Friday beasts!
Link's finger was way too close to the modified knife than it needed to be .. made me nervous!
You’re supposed to blanch the peach before peeling it haha to release the skin from the flesh
I just spent 3 minutes of my life watching 2 grown men attempt to peel a chicken
Can we get a slow-mo of the electric knife through the Nerf football? That jiggle tho
did anyone else read the title as PEEING ? no? just me? great
After watching call me by your name this is slightly uncomfortable lmao. It's funny though
rhett's hair is SO good wtf
Chicken is fruit
Fruits link???
Watching on my PS3Pro.., comenting on my phone..
trending ❤️
No knives for Link xD
Link is getting loose. Rhett is getting tired. Dark Mythical Midnight soon?
1:05 "heere"
First!
#linkeatskangarooballsack
No Durian? Smh
Fun fact chicken is a fruit
Wide Receiving!
13:23 listen with your eyes closed
Since when is chicken fruit
I really love their song so much 0:55
its Gif not Jif
Who peels peaches?
fun fact: you can eat the skin of a kiwi 👍🏼
How's that bromelain? Raw pineapple eating your gums away, always fun
13:58 and his name is JOHN CENAAAAAAAA
The peach they were using were Japanese peach’s which makes it easier
chicken isnt fruit lol
so how do you play will it fruit?
Link is weird and I'm so happy he changed his hair style
kiwis are birds, just sayin
link be like sieg heil at 13:53
I have the exact same mug but it says Pismo Beach on it.
Lol that look on Rhett’s face when Link said he peals burnt skin .  I laughed so hard.
You need to get the right kind of pineapple.
Who peels a peach honestly
Its nerf or nothing😂
"yea, OK...it looks like a testicle"
This was wanky.
10:23 Link’s face= mine when I wake up in the morning
You should of tried a blanched unripe peach
N E C T O R
No.... it can't be true.... Link says gifs like jifs. Not you too Link....
Ima go eat a kiwi now
A food Youtuber did the peach one. It’s a certain kind of peach that you can peal like that with blanching
omggggg I watched them when I was a kid. the nostalgiaaaaaaa
Heat the peach up in warm water
It was a nectarine not a peach
I feel peeled
This must have been the cringiest episode yet.
It was a nectarine not a peach
Link reminds me of my chemistry teacher’s opposite twin.
Comming down to the comments to see what people say about link and the 🥝
That intro though
Can you bring back super note
Japanese GMO peach
And careers over.
The pineapple isn't even ripe.
Imagine thinking these guys are funny
So it's been awhile since I've seen a GMM video, but I feel like Link has changed a lot. Call me crazy, but he seemed to be more intelligent and act more mature in previous videos.
not one of their better episodes...
You guys make laugh I discovered gmm 3 years ago and can't get enough God bless all the gmm crew and team.
Link needs to be put in a straightjacket every time something sharp is on set!
0:31 me when I see 7 year olds doing fortnite dances
13:59 smh link
Link:fridges, stickers, sunburnt backs
Rhett: wtf
Thats one rotten peach.
The song 😭😭😭
Only certain pineapples will do it.
love u guys
I just peeled half a dozen kiwis for a fruit salad (with a spoon). Sooooo satisfying.
I think I will bust open!
13:54 I thought of something quite aggressive
13:55 no comments as a German.
You peel the peach right after you Blanche it....
Freeze the peach than dip in hot water for a second
Why is nobody mentioning Jungkook peeling a pineapple with his bare hands? Any Army's?
Will it never wet edition 2 !!! Bring Never Wet back please!! Thats the episode that turned me into a mythical beast in 2013!! So nostalgic lol the start of satisfying videos
Anybody else miss the old intro?
13:58 Im dissipointed in you link
I’m eating pineapple while watching this video.😂 (I swear I’m not lying)
Nerf football segment was just uncomfortable.
8:43 Lets say Barney Calhoun finally got Lamarr.
Fail. _x
Im kiwi so dont relate me to kagerros bolls plz
I wonder why Link was not allowed to use the electric carver. Cue every Link fail ever
Anyone else have some serious anxiety every time Link put his fingers near the electric knife?
Rhett offers kiwi
Link inhales it
That is not a ripe pineapple lol, completely green
DODECAHEDRON
I eat the kiwi skin
Link was tooooo funny in this one.
Dammit, now I want some fruit.
Apparently you need a special kind of pinapple for that eating method to work.
Two men and a pineapple. What happens next will blowwwww yourrrrrr mind.
these niqqa’s are so disturbing to watch
or just eat the kiwi skin?
Peels chicken for a video called fruit peeling. I guess chicken is a fruit then
You guys kept saying the pineapple might be over ripen when it wasn't even ripe yet in the first place because it's very green.
We got some fruit in here!
The chicken skins the best bit
13.07 When the baby is caught, the suction device they use is called a kiwi!
A kiwi is actually a flightless bird and not a fruit, the fruit is called kiwifruit Google it
I would reassemble the football but replace the core with something heavy. Or a helium balloon.
are your walls green screens because i saw it on one of your old videos
I'm sad at how Rhett cut the ends of that Kiwi.
The peach was blanched
you need to rotisserie the chicken before you can do the peeling, did it at ingles for chicken salads, You throw away the skin but i saved it and ate it lol.
Why am I watching this at 2am 😳
With a peach you have to cut on the seam and then twist. Rhett and Link you should know this!
10:18 this moment has a threatening aura about it
This is so weird and random. Pure silliness. This is why we love Rhett and Link.
GIF!!!
youresoloud, I see you with 5:59
Hi class
Seems like football peeling will be the newest trend in satisfying videos
the peach in the movie was ripe. yours wasn't. Same goes for most of the fruit. It was plucked unripe and then ripened. That's why the stuff doesn't work.
Dad, stop!
Can't tell if Link looked like Aladdin with the nerf hat on or Aladdin's monkey ...🙃
Guy that peeled the peach in the twitter-vid totally blanched the peach before filming the peeling
Link eating the kiwi was the most satisfying thing in this video
13:20 Close your eyes and enjoy.
I was an episode of cutting things with an electric knife
Ur supposed to put the peaces in hot then cold water with ice i think
Cut the peach skin a little bit then blanch
Link really seems like an old man in this video
Does Rhett remind anyone else of Tormund Giantsbane?
12:58 anyone else thinking what i'm thinking?
You might’ve messed up at 13:58
11:12 uhm link
Eat the kiwi skin on
That pineapple was no ripe at all
Did... Did he just say jif ...
TMI lol
that pineapple wasnt ripe
It's knife or nothin'
For pineapple, you can do it but it is a certain type of pineapple. I did it once with Indonesian pineapple. I think. Not sure Indonesian or indian, though
6:00 Drax? Is that you? XD That laugh though Rhett!
Why couldn't they get a ripe pineapple.
wrong kinda peach my dudes the one in the video is a more Asian style of  peach. I'm assuming it grows differently which makes it possible to peel
4:30 What kind of accent is that?
This is so weird
For peaches you have to boil them them give them a ice bath
That’s how I always peel a kiwi
I've never known anyone to peel a peach before they eat it.
I thought the peach had to be blanched in order to peel like the video...
Peeling mangos is so damn hard
#hesdoneitagain
i sense a lot of sass from the one on the left like he doesnt really wanna deal with the one to the right
5:59 why was that the most satisfying thing in this video
CHickEN iS a fRuIT
xD FRUIT PEELING HUH? WHATS THE CHICKEN DOING! (no offence) keep up the good work :)
2 Men 1 Pineapple
That pineapple isn't very ripe it to Green when a pineapple is ripe it should be Orange and has a sweet pineapple scent
I liked the part when Link ate the whole kiwi at once
Watching to 40 year old men fondle a peach is the best thing on my YouTube feed today.
13:58 hmmm.
0:31 Rhett's subtle wtf face
Wasn’t expecting the chicken... -reads title.... ya the title is a lie! This isn’t just peeling fruit!!! Of course not lol it’s GMM lol
Rhett needs a lie in
I never thought I could love 2 random human beings. But look what we have here....
the way Link said, "Ooh, look at that." when we grabbed the kiwi immediately after saying they look like kangaroo testicles made me uncomfortable.
Link and Mark Ruffalo could be brothers :/
Anyone getting "Call Me By Your Name" vibes... oof.
0:30 HAhhaha look at rhett
Never trust link with a knife
Not ur 1st kangaroo testicle was it
Rhetts looks are hilarious.
@Link: it is Gifs, not Jifs
You guys are sadly reaching
And we're gonna pretend they're sober here? hmmmmmmm
In trance: "He peeled a kiwi, with a spoon, he peeled a kiwi, with a spoon"
why do i feel like there really starting to get sick of each other.
#tinderforhotdogs
"we try fruit peeling"

a wild chicken has appeared!
I think that Link is really the one that toes the line. Sure Rhett is louder and more in your face but Link has those subtle jokes where you know he's holding back.
13:59, link looks like a member of the German worker party.
Did you buy that curved knife or did you made it like that?
plz try swedish food taste test
You need to make a vertical knife slice om the peach before you boil it and put it in the cold water for it to work. Hahaha. Same with tomatoes.
The pinnaple of the video is not a normal one. It is called honey comb pinnaple, its realy hard to find it since its very weak to some deseases. It was created in campinas agronomy institute in brazil.
the guy in the peach peeling video blanched the peach in hot water then it went straight into an ice bath, ive tried it before
2 men 1 pineapple
oml link's face at 11:13
What happened to damnyell? Did you fire him?
I like Links shoes
Your peaches are too ripe
there is a certain peach variety that peels easily, but not your peach
5:40 terrified me
I can't be the only one that thinks Rhett looks super tired. Get some sleep Rhett!!
0:31 Rhett: wot
People actually peel peaches? Whats the purpose?
You could've peeled a hotdog 😂
Anyone else worried that the nerf football segment would end with one of them losing a finger?  Cuz I sure was
4:25 not unless you roll a critical hit
It look like is was not even close to being ready and he did the same process as you did
The problem with the pineapple is that it wasnt ripe at all
That purplish colored thing behind the mountain on the left of this intro makes me so uncomfortable...
Tokyo
For both the pineaple and the peach, there are specific mutations of these fruits that behave that way. The pineaple is found on Brazil, ,Uruguay and Argentina (but very raraley), the peach is eastern as far as I know, for the coloration of that peach is very specific.
Hey just a quick question, whats that starting intro song based of? I remembered i heard something similar on the radio....
9:48 
Vegans have left the chat.
What they did with the peach in the video was put it in hot water for maybe 30 seconds and then dunked it in ice water (it's how I peel peaches for canning)
Quality content
13:20 just close your eyes
Who wrote this episode?
Now I want to eat a kiwi.
I come from germany and the most satisfying part was at 13:58
Puts me back in the good old days where we had our Führer
He probably blanched the peach
Too funny!  I have to try to cut a kiwi that way!
Aren't you meant to peel a kiwi with a spoon, like that's the only way I have ever done it
when you said kangaroo ballsack I no joke craped my self  i really need new under wear
“I made a baby nerf football” -link 2019
0:29 rhett: WTF
the real horror here is your pronunciation of gif, it looks like gift, gif is said like gift but with no T
Did they eat peach peel? That's normal?
At 10:58, Rhett knew. Link was headed over the edge
Froothhh
Is your mascot a chicken with wings because mythical means not real?
If you like watching people split fruits in half with their hands you need to look up Jongho from Ateez
“Do vegetables have fruits?”
Lol that is anything but a ripe pineapple
I could use a life sponsorship,  a way to help me build an adequate foundation in life, that let's me support myself and my three kids eventually independently.  After my divorce,  I can't seem to get the right opportunity to lead me to be self sufficient...
I’m asking for a friend lol but why is Link not allowed to use cutting utensils?
You guys are talking about secret societies a lot so who came up to you and advise you to put this in your program and which one of you is a Freemason
you need a specific type of pineapple for the pineapple trick
You’re supposed to boil the peach.
am i the only one that thought this was a little bit sensual, like the zoom ups on the hands
i always peel my kiwis with spoons! there’s a bit of a learning curve but it absolutely works and is super efficient.
I eat kiwi skins
He probably put the peach in boiling water, they peel easily then
Links hot
0:32 😂
Come on baby
What the kangaroo is a girl huh Link
did anyone get hurt?
What's the song they're parodying between rounds
so 11:26-13:32 is literally rhett and link doing surgery on someone, close ur eyes and listen to that lmao
Watching them play with the nerf looks so cool, like they were 11 again or something.
Apparently, the pineapple in that video is a special kind of pineapple.
This is so awkward
Am I the only one that eats the kiwi with the skin, lol....
I'm guessing you guys got dinged for copyright ID on the fruit peeling jingle (Nelly). YouTube is in a strange place right now...
FrOoTs
This is so cringy who are these ppl. Actually I don’t care.
I want boiled chicken
interesting
how do you peel a homogeneous object lololol
Too pure
13:55
Use an unripe peach! Will be harder and therefore easier to peel
13:59
13:34
Close your eyes at 11:25 you’re welcome.
call me by your name
Some how something in every episode of this show somehow makes me loose my appetite
Watching Rhett eat gives me a headache. But it's also funny
Can I just get an asmr video of Rhett eating please
Rhett’s face at 0:30 😂😂
Yes the peach guy cheated. It was a fake peach.
You guys have not been to Japan, those peaches are called momo... the skin is so much smoother to peel
Kiwi with a spoon is like the only way to do it
If you worked in the food industry this video means nothing
13:59 they have to know what this looks like
5:54
Guy probably cut the peach a little
So a chicken is a fruit. Yo I knew I was a hardcore vegetarian with all the chicken I ate for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.😚
It would've been so epic if Rhett wore the booty shorts from the What Are My Pants? episode while peeling that peach.
Am I the only one who eat a kiwi with the skin on?
you guys should eat a zebra tarantula
a nerf football is the new fruit. everyone make way
Do other people not eat the fuzzy part of the peach?
Will it Pot Pie
Why do I have the suddenly want to peel nerf footballs?
10:04.
0:55 nice over written song
9:16
What are Jif's? are they like Gif's?
13:57
I eat the kiwi skins why peel them?
that chicken is so dry, how did it get to the point where it looks like grandpas legs?
What’s a Jif?
"We need to birth it it one satisfying motion" -Link, talking about a Nerf football's severed insides
My hands are sticky just watching this
No baby kingaroo
Haha Rhett treats link like a kid when it comes to sharp objects.. cracks me up everytime
OR.....you could just cut your fruit
6:00
0:56
6:00
You gotta boil the peach and put it in cold water after. Like a boiled egg
6:00
I’m excited to try the kiwi method again, I tried it one time and didn’t really succeed, but maybe I wasn’t using the right technique, haha
I forgot abt them until tdy bc they came on my recommendation and omggggggg they both look the same as 3 yrs ago!
Fail?💩💩💩
That's not a ripe pineapple, not even a little bit
Come on link it’s gif not gif
6:00
Peeling sunburned backs, Rhet ಠ_ಠ
jiffs??? reeee
Coolin peeling vid
Link if you didn’t realize THE INTERNET IS FULL OF LIES
So idk if you guys did this before but what if you guys tried doing ASMR videos in your own style?
Tina's kiwi!

THE BIGGEST DYING CHANNEL😪😪😪😪😪😪😢😢😢😢😢😢🤬🤬🤬😇🤬😱😱🥵🥵
Commenting.
👍
Does any one know what the real song is at 0:57?
What the what?!
I do the peach thing all the time. Didn’t know it was considered a hack but it is easier if you do it from the top not the side
They should peel a cow tongue it’s soo great
Funniest episode I have ever seen. Actual tears 😹
That’s how I peel kiwi’s.
Anyone watching this morning show at night?
They can eat anything
10:55 I was like "THE CUP, THE CUP, OH MY GOD THE CUP"
New drinking game: take a drink every time Link puts his finger WAY too close to the electric knife
Hmmmm...................
Pineapple wasn’t ripe enough. It would be more yellowish. Side fact tell which pineapple would be the sweetest and juiciest, smell the bottom of the fruit. The sweeter the smell the better
This was the funniest GMM in a while
the kiwi with a spoon thing is just how people in the uk are told to eat kiwis, this isn't new
I can’t wait to see them sing that beginning part on ltat
The most offensive thing about this video is that you boiled the chicken!
Since when chicken and a football are fruits
So you’re tellin’ me not everyone uses a spoon to eat kiwis?
Well chicken is a vegetable
At 13:05 they violate a nerf football
It's gif.
Will it pop tart?
:/
Me: Doesn't watch good mythical morning for 1 year 2 months 6 hours 35 minutes and 29 seconds.

Rhett and Link: Welcome back.... We've been expecting you...
This sucker was FULL of innuendo. I really appreciate it bro.
I was just focused on how much I love kiwis and peaches this whole time. Mmmm I love fruit.
8:34 Two men mutilate a pineapple
5 feet apart 'cause they're not gay
Am I crazy or were those peaches way under blanched?
Am I really watching two grown men peeling fruits and enjoying it FML
your suppose to eat a kiwi with the skin.
Form a master, PhD doctrine Schooler talking.  It all depends on the variety of fruit you choose. The pineapple was probably a locally grown and not shipped from another country which are very tough fibers vs locally shipped.
You have to boil the peach
The intros can’t get bad :)
Kangaroo testicles lol
1:30 you have to be a boy though
Rhetoric.
Every good O.P has and Anthony.
Someone make a soundboard of this episode please
666 dislikes
why can't link use knives?
So that’s the video? 😂
Oh the horror...
I'm surprised most people didn't know about the kiwi one.  I thought that was common knowledge?  Maybe it's just because I had to cut up tons of kiwis at a self-serve froyo place I worked at years ago...
Weirdest episode in a while
Whats the best dipping sauce for pizza rolls?
OOoo Link I like yo boots ;)
You didn't have an electric spoon?
Link really really wanted all of these to work xD
People did that pinaple thing before 😂 its not knew
I wonder why the video title was changed 🤔
Wrong type of peach.
I like spaghetti
You were supposed to blanch the peach
man the peaches were so wrong to watch
Did he say jifs?!
Now rewatch it but with your eyes closed.
Weird watching it with your eyes closed
this was um weird
goddammit its gif not jif.
I was today years old when I learned that a chicken is a fruit
Why you want a boiled chicken tho
It's gifs not jifs
Me and my brother tried to do the pineapple thing and it did not work, it was way too hard to do
Was that a little Carnac repeat I heard in there....A little Carson/McMahon tribute if you will?
You could use the inside of the football to hold your beer cans
I laughed so hard at this episode 😂
The pineaple is actually quite easy, but it uses other kind of pineapple, its a brazilian kind called gomo de mel.
the thing about the pineapple one, is that it is pre cut all around to the core.
People peel Kiwi fruit?
5:10 - 5:39 close your eyes
He said jif
Lol wrong kind of peachs and not prept fully 😀
How did I know link was gonna put those football ends to his chest? 😂
I sort of miss the days they were trying things on camera without their crew pre-testing them first.
That chicken's terribly undercooked.
7:38 🤣
I’ve always eaten kiwi with a spoon like that
ok whos idea was it to let Link close to a knife, I was cringing every time he stuck his finger by it lol and kiwi's now have anew name :)
I’m not a fan of episodes involving food
I prefer my Ronco© Super Chicken Peeler. Thumbs are for chumps.
I thought they were going to peel eachother
6:00 You're welcome
golsa better
He hailed and got an arm band😂😂 #ww2 #jewsrunthegovernmet
“Reality is often disappointing.”
this was the funniest video i've seen in awhile :)
Link makes everything perverted ahaaa
Cut the skin around first 😂
Peel P50😂😂
That's the wrong peach species. Lmao
Chicken is a fruit now?
This show has really been going downhill lately
Is link okay....?
If ‘Frustrating Fruit Peeling’ videos were popular, this video would be the blueprint for viral success.
The peach in then video was boiled first that’s why it didn’t work
Green pineapple smh
The peach one is well known for older people lol that’s how my grandmother taught us how to peel peaches when canning them 😝
For the peach, you need to keep it in scalding water for awhile to loosen the skin from the peach. I did it all the time when helping my mom can peaches.
The peach is a Japanese peach and they do peel better than the ones here
Jif?!
what about peeling a mango with a cup?
So many potential that’s what she said jokes
Yum
It’s literally because they let the peaches sit...
I dunno why Link has so much energy today but it's great.
Link just made me feel uncomfortable
The pineapple is too ripe Link?
It’s literally green 😂
0:56 The best intro ever!!! I like it!!!!
The pineapple is disturbing. Like people who bite the whole Kit-Kat.
Yall have to buy a specific kind of pineapple from Japan for the peeling effect :q Maybe go to Tokyo (Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat)
I'm not sure if this video was satisfying, but it was very.... appealing.
As soon as I saw Link teaching for the other end of the football, I just knew 11:13 was going to happen.
Ohhhh so THAT'S where Good Mythical Crew went.
Thats how I've always eaten kiwis
I wonder how Sponge Bob did it so good
It has to be the right type of pineapple... IAC Gomo De Mel is the right type.
Most of the fruits from the videos were either under-ripe (the peach) or overripe (the pineapple). Link was quite wrong about the pineapple they tried it on.
Rhett, that was the best primetime (subtle) way you could say "Dat looks like some yoga pants ripping"
two men mutilate a pineapple
The kids were playing will it fruit with fruit
This was awful to watch lol
Didn’t know a football was a fruit? Anyone else? I’m shocked!
Lol
WHY IS NO ONE USING A RIPE PINEAPPLE??? FOR GODS SAKE, PEOPLE
LMAO, when rhett and lik started to verbally abuse me saying "Stop askin questions" i legit told my screen (im not god damn)
That leaves you with a regular old Plumbus
"But there is a more satisfying way, just watch!" close up of James Gordon's face over a sink
I saw the butcher knife and my first thought was "oh, thank goodness they gave the pineapple to Rhett"!!!
Actually the pineapple video was recorded in brazil, and the pineapple in the video its a specific variety of pineapple.
 the name of this variety is "gomo de mel" (honey bud) developed in Brazil by the IAC Agronomic Institute of Campinas, the research took 11 years, and it's sweet and has a more fragile buds.

Even in Brazil the video was a kind of fake 'cause isn't easy to find that variety in the market, 
the one we consume the most in Brazil are pineapples like the hard one used in the good mythical morning video.
That chicken 🤢🤮🤮
Two of my many personalities are showing in this video 😂😂
That nerf football peel is a DIY bite guard for the zombie apocalypse
Come on baby

Yep that will be in the dirty Gmm moments
Tasty did the peach thing and found that they had to blanch it to work. I think thats what they did.
Savor the Peelies
Will it Margarita Salt?
I have no words
The pineapple is actually a special type of pineapple, it grows in Asia, i tried in Hongkong, i think is called the easy peeler or the cherimoya pineapple, ours was from Japan. Its indeed super easy to pull. Dunno if they export them to the US tho.
I have come to the sudden realization that Rhett and Link are slowly turning into the two old Muppets...
xD
"Find where the baby is stuck, and dislocate it" Um.........
MEN do physical work like construction,  no one expects a beta to MAN-open a peach
if they blached it and put it in a ice bath correctly itd peel like a tamato does
Pew a kiwi wit a spoon
"Do VeGeTaBlEs HaVe FrUiTs?" -Link 2017 (4:32 - What Are My Pants (CHALLENGE))
that's the wrong kind of pineapple
literally two seconds on google and you discover that this only work with a certain type of pineapple
The plural of 'fruit' is 'fruit', not 'fruits'
<3
I really like link in this video lmao he was funny asl 🤣
Nerf pool floaties FTW !!
Ok no... None of that was satisfying.
Gotz to dislocate dat baby!!!!
YOUR KANGAROO NUT IS LEAKING.
With the nerf caps
He's gonna do it
He's gonna do it
He's done it 🙈🙊
That first segment is so disturbing for me 😂
13:59 nice save link
Link! Peel your chickens in private, you psycho...
Like a peach I eat the entire kiwi.
Quit this video at the nerf part
That pineapple was NOT ripe it’s green!
I think part of the problem with the peaches is they've got the wrong kind... The original video was a Japanese peach, but Rhett and Link have typical American peaches.
Rhett with the underwear comment. Hilarious!
I'm pretty sure the dude used a type of asian peach that has a separate skin like that..
wait isnt this the normal way to eat kiwi ? thats how ive been doing it
Just cut the kiwi fruit in half then eat it with a spoon
Video title: we try peeling fruit.
Rhett and Link: we try peeling a chicken
The peach is probably a Japanese peach and those are hella expensive
The peach part looked soooo NSFW 😂
Omg link is so wholesome. Love him so much!!
I Always peel my kiwis with s spoon! I thought it was normal.
You guys should have the "longest titles award"
When the babies stuck use the forceps!
6:00 so 👌
As you can say, this video is appealing to watch.
Wrong kind of peach, right or wrong?
Rhett and link rated R
Howtobasic just got real excited at 8:46
Make a cut in between with a knife for the peach
Link ode mook 🤣
Hi
Welp.. Sad life, I’m allergic to pineapples AND kiwis.
I was peeling an egg while watching this(it was a fried egg)
For the peaches: I make a lot of jam and the skin on a freestone peaches tends to be loser then clingstone peaches.  The peaches you have on the show are definitely clingstone.
<3
So chicken is a fruit now.?
11:11 Somehow I knew Link was going to do that, I was just waiting for it to come
The Nerf was my favorite part! I was satisfied. :)
7:00 This does not work with all pineapples. There is a very specific type of pineapple that this works with — The Cherimoya Pineapple.
It's insane how much Link gets into this episode
That peach pealing is dirty.
I think it’s the wrong type of peach guyS lol
shut your eyes during the nerfball thingy  XD you are welcome
The peach in the video is a special peach. Not the kind u have.
13:53 When you're a teenage boy in Germany during WWII
Is the second r in 'here' on purpose? 0:58
1:08 your welcome
Peel a kiwi? Just wash it and eat the nearly all of it leaving the hard bit at the flower end.
With the peach, you’re supposed to stroke the peach with the back edge of a kitchen knife so that the skin can separate from the fruit on the inside
Who peels a peach
do a juice of canned food taste test
10:18 when you ask your mom what’s for dinner
The peach was a special hack, it was boiled and soaked in water then shoved in ice cold water instantly. It makes it easy to peel with your thumbs
You were trying to do the first one with a peach, but maybe the example was with a nectarine? They have firmer peels. A peach seems to be too soft.
Kiwi skin is edible
This pineaplle was made in my country🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The issue with your peaches: They're too soft. They could be overly ripe, and/or you boiled them rather than blanched them.
You've got the wrong species of pineapple.
(Call Me by Your Name -2017)  2:21
Love me some good Chicken fruit
all about the perfectly lewd animations life
Link saying new at 6:24 sounded auto-tuned
You were supposed to boil the peach for 2 minutes and then peel it...... Duh
Pineappl has to be almost rotten
The guy actually boiled the peach and did it.
You didn't watch Emmy peeling a pineapple. She knows a thing or two about pineapples, & she peeled it easily.
I’m convinced all the video fruits were frozen
Those patriots footballs 😂
I feel sorry for link. He seemed so excited
well they tried
You guys know that chicken isn't a fruit, right?
Where are the comments for "herre?"
The pineapples that pull apart are a specific species. The Cherimoya Pineapple.
Anyone else eat the kiwi with the skin?
Any one else thing the silver of the nerf football kind of looked like fish skin?
I swear I’ve watched this video like a year ago??
YASS THAT INTRO SONG!
Never knew nerf footballs were fruits 🤔
i think u need a firm peach
Links opening 🤣
Never knew chicken was a fruit
I will never look at kangaroos the same way ever again.
Watching link just take that kiwi like a boss is what you need to get through the day 😂😂
Huh I live in Denver
You have to blanch the peach!
Not the same type of peach...?
I've butchered and castrated a bull, but watching Link skin that chicken made me want to be a vegetarian
2:22 I'm dying.
everything about the kiwi part of this video.
When Link couldn't peel the fruit after he picked on Rhett for failing, I was expecting Rhett to make a joke about how it was satisfying to see Link fail too. Reality.... I'm disappointed in both of them!
That pineapple is not ripe at all. It’s green still
Do you guys own a sharp knife?
Link wants to be the one to cut it sooo bad but knows better. So instead he's a 'backseat' slicer.
Vat19 copied you guys.
Don't peel a kiwifruit, just cut it in half!!
Yay
Link being controlling for almost 15 minutes straight
6:08. I think that's my favorite link moment lol
WRONG PEACHES YA DOOFUS
Spreadin' that peach crack open!!
I always use a spoon on my kiwi
Link and Mark ruffalo are very similar
If you get the specific breed of pineapple you car peel it. It's call eye peelin pineapple (สัปรดฉีกตา).
Do vegetables have fruits?
that last clip lol they were playing Will it fruit with actual fruits..
Changed title I see
Link had this weird uncle energy the whole kiwi segment.
has to give birth in september.... listens to rhett’s description.... can I cancel?😂😂😂
I'm sorry for the chicken
jifs...
The peach in the video looked one of those Japanese one. There really soft and have a lot of water in them. The skin on those tear really easily.
Why are they such children here 😂
🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
Herre...
😂😂😂😂😀😄
Stop wasting entire bodies of animals...
Is it bad I don't know like 90% of the guests they have on the show now?
i wonder if she knows that salsa is made from tomato
Does Eva not know what salsa is made of?! 😂😂
"Youtuber extraordinaire, Eva Gutowski!"


Who?
I would have loved to see Chef Josh throwing his own salsa and see what they said about it!
This smells like tomato. Really I thought salsa was made from bananas.
"I have a phobia of ketchup" stop with dramatics please 😒
Please never invite that woman again, we've grown to love Link's food pickiness... But she's just too much
She was getting on my nerves 😑
"This smells like tomato" does she know what salsa is?
7:40 Rhett is crying or for help and everyone just ignores him
I love that she says, “you know what time it is,” without being asked. So satisfying.
I have never seen someone complain so much about everything on this show
She was so incredibly unpleasant.
Who’s in charge of getting guests on the show? Probably my least favorite by far.
She’s so dramatic.... I Really do think Link and Rhett should do this alone 😊👌🏼
I love how she describes every salsa as looking/smelling like tomato sauce.
"no matter what salsa shows up at the party, I'm eating it". Makes a gross face everytime she eats one and physically won't take another bite.
Am I the only one who found her kind of irritating?
Omg
Can’t stand her
"This smells like tomato sauce"... all of these are literally sauces that are made from tomatoes.
A LOT of deleted comments on this one.. 😂
Y’all chose the wrong person for this 🤦🏼‍♂️
I was slightly let down when I realized they arent guessing which salsa it is and not just giving it a score, because that's always so fun to watch.
Eva was negative about everything (even in good mythical more).  Maybe some day she'll become likeable.
She looks disgusted like 90% of the time
Why would they get someone who doesn't like salsa to taste salsa? Did she ever go above a 4?
mild = tomato sauce with onion
medium = tomato sauce with onion and cayenne pepper 
hot/spicy = salsa
God I hope they dnt have her on again
Link is really starting to look like a silver fox 👀💕 it works on him honestly.
It’s my first time seeing this girl and I’m not a fan /:
I miss the blindfold / guessing the brand videos.
Rhett: "It looks good, it ends good but the middle is real bad... like my life." O.O
Ava : ketchup phobia
Link: dislikes tomatoes in his food

Judges salsa...
Eva: * french kisses the Tostitos bottle *
Link: * also french kisses the Tostitos bottle *
Rhett: I'm just gonna find the bottom and give it a little peck.
😂😂😂 I was so uncomfortable but also laughing hysterically. I did not expect THAT to happen 😬😂
Link: tomato hater
Link: salsa brand expert
Link: hypnotist's success story
Can you please never have this person on the show ever again. Thank you.
You were going to taste test salsa which is loaded with tomato and this is the person you choose to be one the show? Hmmmm
I was actually disappointed by this episode tbh..
I am actually rather insulted that she didn't eat one of them. if you come on the show to taste foods DO YOUR JOB!!
This chick not know how to eat wit her mouth closed tho fr? I expected a lot of people to talk about this 😂😂 she muchin really unpleasantly
I wish they would’ve got someone who actually likes salsa
Wow she it literally insufferable
This girls wack she didn’t even try a salsa........... how adventurous
I hate when people don’t understand what a phobia is and claim to have one...
I like how her initial reaction to every salsa is contempt.
Damn she really said trying ketchup was “brave” Standards really fell huh
They got mild salsa that was the mistake. Medium salsa is the best. Not too spicy but just enough and you can actually taste the flavor over the spice
Good thing Link was recently hypnotized to enjoy this challenge!!! all them tomatoes!!!
You have to get pace CHUNKY cause original pace is a lil watery but pace chunky is basically just Tostitos
Every time someone said it taste like tomatoe sauce i rolled my eyes because that's what salsa is
nobody:


Rhett: "sauce-a"
I’m learning more and more every episode how much Rhett just likes food 😂
i love how she said the last part without being told to!
And the winner is...make your own. It's the best that way!
girl in the middle seems toxic
“But the sweet is just, no” riveting analysis there Eva😀
I have to stop watching because she is driving me crazy
8:20
Eva: It smells like canned soup
Link: 😟
"Smells like tomato sauce" well damn I wonder why
For these "Taste Test" episodes. Bring along Josh's take on it if possible! :D
"It looks good, it ends good, the middle is real bad... just like my life."
This woman is unpleasant.
In the famous words of Rhett "This tastes exactly how you imagine" lol
Eva... Salsa has tomato, it’s ok if they smell like tomato sauce 😂
Very underwhelming episode.
I can’t believe link just compare Newman’s salsa to a damp cig😅😅
I don’t like her. I can’t finish watching it.
Mrs. Renfro’s verde hot salsa is the best.
We need a "London Salsa" song from R&L cover/parody of London Calling
She was fun, but am I the only that prefers no guests and just the two of them
destroying brands reputation one morning at a time
This was an unfair competition cuz the Whole Foods one was medium heat and the others were mild.
I LOVE the end with the salsa kissing. Hilarious.

But for the record, Chi-Chi's (not shown) is the best salsa, though Tostitos is pretty okay. (y)
Watching Eva double dip during the tostitos hurts my soul.
Link hates tomato but happily shovels salsa 🤔
I was so excited to watch this and then I saw Eva. Wth 😅
I'm Mexican and I eat homemade salsa everyday, and it's fire roasted not this weird cold tomato and onion contraption.
I coulda told you tostitos was the best among em , but you should really just get the fresh salsa
Girl be looking like Lola Boa from Brandy and Mr Whiskers
Have Ericsurf6 on the show!!! He would be amazing
Phobia of ketchup and manners
"This is like a frat barbecue". *Rhett looks up with an expression of exasperation and considers giving his lecture on how barbecue is a food.
Gotta love when a guest isolates a whole group of your audience.
"Hello my name is spicy WhOooOOo" just that random whooo got me
None of those are real salsa 😷😷 Especially mild 😬
Bless his heart, Rhett says "sauce-uh" instead of "salsa" like my 80 year old dad! LOL
Convinced Eva doesn't like salsa 🤣
You guys should do a "Will it Soda Stream"! Not sure if it's been done before but I think it would be really fun!
I really didn’t like her, was wondering if anyone else felt that way and I was glad to see in the comments that I was not alone.
I love when Link says what we are all thinking haha. New chip or turn it!
Maaaan minus points for double dipping for the girl
tostito or how every you spell it is the best 1 !!!
Never again with her, she has a nails on chalkboard quality about her.
As an Arizonan I am offended

Just kidding
Oh God the way those tourists pronounced "Chichen Itza" and then the way Link said it makes me want to vomit.
This is how many times they said chunky
 ⬇️
Girl have I got a subreddit for you r/ketchuphate we are a rare species but are growing we would love to have you
Thumbs down on video. No more guests please.
You guys need to get salsa that is chilled. That is real salsa with actual whole ingredients
Mild sales is not the best thing to test for flavor lol you get, you guessed it, tomato sauce lol.
Me on this show: 
How are you with salsa?
Me: I’m allergic to chilis.
Og’s remember the old intro song
Why does she look like the Youtuber Sharpie? Lol
Rhett kissing the bottom of the jar cracked me up! HAhaha
Mild salsa is going to taste like tomato sauce. You should have gone with Medium -- not too hot, but certainly more kick than tomato sauce.
7:51 link doesnt know how to count and says 11 instead of 12
What the heck are you eating mild for? It's only for uncultured swine and led you all to pick frickin' Tostitos salsa as the best because it's super salty.

I'm disappointed.
Of course when it’s not a guessing game, Link would have good guesses. 🤣
1st dislike on a gmm show...
Stay with the gmm team
Cinco de Mayo < Revenge of the Fifth
12:32 it’s Chichen Itza, not Chitza Nitza 😂
This girl didnt like any of these salsas 😂 if you dont like ketchup then why are you even in this salsa video lol
"He aged like a president" Rhett.

Thinking... Link for president 2020 lol
Picante sauce is thinner than salsa. Pace sells both. 

Also, Pace pronounced pah-chey is latin for peace.
7:05 According to the picture, it's not a mild. It's a medium, Link. 🤔 Hmm
Damn she’s so picky! Just eat the damn salsa omg
She will complain about anything
Rhett Double Dips at 8:30 after yelling at link for double dipping a few episodes ago smh
Their ratings made sense. I never buy low quality salsas like these. I only get the ones in the refrigerated deli section that aren’t super processed.
Rhett: What does Newman's taste like?
Link: I'll know it when I taste it
...
Link: Gets it wrong
iÍ was going to watch this till I saw Eva...
"it's like my life" 😂😂😂😂 anybody caught that
No Kirkland from Costco?
Mateo's is probably my favorite. 
Then there's Mrs. Renfro's, Jardines, Clint's, and Kylitos. :)
Link said "okay guess were double dippen" then blows on salsa 😂😂😂
I love salsa especially in my mac and cheese! 😉😁👍
Imagine if link prepared the salsa how many cuts would he have?
"It looks good it ends good but the middle is real bad. Just like my life"

 Rhett-2019
Frog Ranch salsa is THE BEST. Order some, you won't be disappointed.
I love the GMM crew so much, guests, not so much.
Rhett & Link should ask their hypnotist to hypnotize Eva to like ketchup.
I ALSO HAVE A PHOBIA OF KETCHUP!!!😲😲😲😅
I've been saying this is my favourite salsa. I'm a salsa genius
my sister just told me that the reason link sits on the left is because his name starts with a L and rhett sits on the right because his name starts with a R . (if your facing their point of veiw) neat.
They managed to get the one girl in the world,  who has a phobia of tomato sauce..... 
And then involved her in a game, aimed at consuming and judging 'basically'  the very thing she's afraid of ahaha.
‘London Salsa’ was my nickname in college
missed the opportunity to say "let's TACO bout that".
I love me some salsa- going to make some later tonight! 
General suggestion: A cross-over with Feast of Fiction? I'd love to see what they'd come up with!
Homemade is always the best way to go...
i don't like her much, she's dramatic and that whole lil crew she's apart of.
links "you wanna get into that" is my mood @ youtube
What kind of people get mild salsa?? It's literally ketchup
Should have tried Kirkland organic it's the best!
Who's afraid of ketchup?
Ava, 🤦🏻‍♀️
Tomatoes are the main ingredient in salsa so of course they all may smell like tomatoes. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"A damp cigarette"
Organic Great Value Salsa. 
Been tasting salsas for a while and that's the one I've landed on
Eva saying “you know what time it is”
"It's like a damp cigarette..."  8:45
The easiest job in the world
Medium spicy, chunky, Pace salsa (NOT picante sauce) is the best for me. 
Picante is way too runny, and the mild spicy tastes too much like ketchup.
Doesn't have any flavor because its MILD...totally not salty or anything lol
I love this channel sm!!😂❤️❤️
Yo hablo español pero me gusta mucho sus videos 
Saludos desde México
Jarred salsa ALL tastes like tomato sauce. I only buy fresh salsa.
I love salsa! Me and my brother use it every time we have tortilla chips
I love when these videos are accidentally helpful lol
Rhett and Link have consumed truly horrifying things for their show, and as a guest, you refuse to even try a salsa?
Hellllooooooooo Newman! -Jerry Seinfeld.
"....unless it's with the bandit."  Lol ! !
Salsa Queen is the best if you can get your hands on it 👌🏻
"Sadie's not as hot" is the best store salsa I've had.
"She knows whats up". That was nice that se knew without saying
I love how Rhett calls it sauce-uh 😂😂
Great content, very informative.  👍
Chi Chi's salsa is probably the best store bought salsa IMO.
"She knows whats up" I love that!! 😂😂
Havent watched in a while but you guys should give a raise to the person who made the intro sequence's music. One of the best in a while
Lmao! "Like my life" he says. 🤣
finally another person with a phobia of ketchup !!!
Y'all needed to try Mrs.Renfros salsa. Best salsa hands-down.
Please make Rhett saying “It looks good, it ends good, the middle is real bad. Just like my life.” A green screen meme.
Eva had 7 months pregnant taste buds😂😂
I swear I freaking love their channel....love you Rhett and Link💕💕😘
This one smells like tomato sauce? ITS SALSA GUYS! The main ingredient is tomato.
Tostitos chunky mild is my go-to! Vindicated!
You should really do another Rett conspiracy theory
My favorite is shop rites mango salsa it's amazing
I always get Newman's Own. Their Medium Chunky is really tasty! I like the smokiness I guess.  I can't stand ketchup either...
"this smells like tomato sauce" WOW what a surprise
12:14 Link keep doing you man that was hilarious
Please, PLEASE invite Kitboga to your show.  PLEASE!
Link doesn't like tomatoes but he is going to town on the salsa.
Something doesn't fit.
to be honest everyone looks so awkward in gmm


and they like talking over each others
Link: “... boy, I’d hate to meet spicy on the street!” 🌶🌶🌶 🥵 🥵🥵
just like my life
rhett are you okay
I'm very glad that Tostitos got #1. I've always thought it was the best lmao
Nobody:
Link: BLOWS on salsa
Phobia of ketchup, someone’s a little dramatic
Rhett: He aged like a president.
Me: McLaughlin/Neal 2020
Salsa's just so much better made fresh, without preservatives. I'm not surprised by your low scores in the slightest.
I only know about her because I was watching a video of Ryland in a drive through listening to literally my life 🌝
La Victoria Thick' N Chunky mild is my favorite
Huh! Eating salsa..cool
Also... sauce-a or salsa? Rhetts saying sauce-a..😶
"Is this the one that's like tomato saucy?"  smh
Mrs. Renfro's Ghost Pepper salsa is the best. ANYONE AGREE??
Pace is my personal fave. I was eating it while I watched this
No Herdez? I declare this test invalid.
For the love of god, next time you guys go to London, ask someone where you should eat. You had food at the Slug and Lettuce and now judge all British food by that standard. I have been to America multiple times and don't think Denny's is representative of all American food.
Tostitos and their salsa and their con queso is the best store-bought stuff. Nothing else touches it.
"JUST LIKE MY LIFE" SIGHS
My nanas best tasting, yall gotta try that salsa 100%
BLEND ALL THE SALSA IT MIGHT BE GOOD
MY 2 FAV YOUTUBERS YAYAY
9:23 Haha, I love the "Smokey and the Bandit" reference you can tell these guys are country boys at heart!
Baja Cafe Restaurant style salsa is the best of all the packaged salsa! Next is Rojo's restaurant salsa!
0:30 BACK TO THE RHYTHM WITH THE FUNKY JAM LET ME CLEAR MY THROAT oldy but a goody my man
The Pace salsa they used (at least according to their reference picture) is picante sauce, which is thinner by nature. Pace does have a chunky salsa.
"i can still eat the whole bowl"
Kirkland organic salsa is best on the market
Y'all should do a "Will it Mochi?" with Sauce Stache.
Trader Joe’s has the best salsas.
They have so many choices too!
It bothers me the way Rhett says “sauce-uh” :/
Link is my spirit animal
not diggin her vibe at all
"No Mole" - what does mole have to do with this? It's more of a stewing sauce.
Why dose linc look like Garth from Wayne's world
“It’s like a damn cigarette” 🤣 omg link are you okay??
Quick question, do ya'll like your salsa hot or cold? Me personally, I cant eat cold salsa😂
Y'all need to try on the boarder best salsa ever!
wow lets just find the pickiest eaters ever and invite them to hate on food
As someone who LOVES Salsa, i would ace this
I've learned you can always tell the whole foods product over others because it's always freaking unnecessarily spicy.
What's happening to Rhett @1:25
Sad part is Spanish and Hispanics don't shop on Amazon we make it
Hey Link, we should let the ladies dip first next time
I love 😍 Tostitos salsa its the best for sure 🌶
the smokyness is from scorching the peppers on a stove
"I'm just gonna find the bottom and give it a little peck."
-Rhett 2019 xD
9:25 Smokey and the Bandit reference :)
you know that theres a feature in the episode when theyre sitting like that 0:00 😂
Lmao Link with a revelation at the end there.
Pace is my favorite salsa!:)
Mortuusequusphobia--- the fear of ketchup
"Was this the one that was like tomato saucey?..." YES IT IS SALSA!!!! lol
I read the title as "Bottled Water Taste Test." Wow.
Salsa by definition is "tomato sauce" and that's their biggest criticism....
You gotta go at least Medium to get any good salsa, c'mon!
For the Pace, you got picante sauce instead of salsa, picante is more thinner then Salsa.
The left is your childhood crush, the middle is your ex and the right is your gf, the salsas are your qualities as a person. They didn't like any of it. But they still dealt with you.
One of the best titles for a game you guys have come up with
Never bring her back.
Whole foods salsa was a Medium xD
you guys should do a video to determine the best burger side chip
YOU NEED TO TRY MATEO’S SALSA ITS AMAZING!!!
I live for these blind taste test 😩😂
HATES TOMATOES NOOOOO THE HYPNOTISING DIDN'T WORK XD
My favorite salsa is great value restaurant style medium salsa. It's so surprisingly good.
My favorite salsa is Newman’s mild peach salsa😍🤤🤤 it’s so good!
remake the unicorn rap
A Fear Of Ketchup.


Please Explain
this video has given me the need for them to taste test grocery store and/or restaurant queso
Wait.Link hates tomatoes but will eat salsa🤨
OHMYGOD EVA
Trader Joe's has some bangin salsa!
Rhett consistently pronounces 'salsa' as 'sauce-a'
“It’s like a damp cigarette”😂😂
Y’all have got to try Herdez salsa casera in medium🤤🙌🏻
I love how well i was watching this and doing homework there was a playlist in the backround. Song was "Im on vacation" by u guys so yay!
So we got Link saying, "H-what? H-were? H-wen? H-wip."
Now Rhett's saying, "Sauce-ah."
Bunch o' southern bois pronunciatin' deir werds 😂
Literally my life....😉❤
Chi-chi’s is the best grocery store salsa 💃
I predicted this video's existence.
I love how one of you guys do something weird then 3 do weird things and laugh around lol 😂 more test blinding test please?
Maybe the reason everything was so bland is because they used mild salsa.  I understand wanting to be consistent, but if they wanted more flavor, they should have gone for medium.
Alan Jackson at 7:53 😂😂💀
Eva rocking the 'ramen noodles' bun look on point!
I am serious about this. Salsa is a foodgroup in my household.
"I'm gonna find the bottom and give it a little peck" thats my life.
Thx for buying smosh
SOMEONE FINALLY SAID "YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS" WITHOUT BEING PROMPTED!

Been waiting for this! I already loved her on the show, but that sealed it.
You posted our video!! How awesome😍 we love you guys and Mexico was amazing. We went for our honeymoon ❤
Yo, that 365 salsa is medium not mild... you said they were all mild
GMM.  Medium is not mild.  (Whole Foods)
Thanks for the rent reminder....
"It's like a damp cigarette" - the best brand tagline in the world lol - but truthfully I am also a smokey man who likes a smokey plan.
you all should do chips next and keep the best salsa consistent
What did we learn today? Get Queso dip instead.
You forgot about Chi Chi! 😱
Tostitos Habanero is what you need
No Chi-Chi's?!? Come on guys!
Link, you were wrong about Newman's.  That was actually Frontera.
its like my life 😂😂
I miss them saying "as you can see, we can't"
Herdez is by far the best ya'll messing up
Cinco de Mayo is my birthday
I cannot find a good jar salsa. I keep looking though...
Double dipping pretty gross
They should do a spinach dip taste test. 😁
I was doing great until Link frenched the Tostitos.
I agree with her about mole! Who even likes that?!?
eva reminds too much of Liza Koshy
I have a phobia of ketchup too oml
I like 'em big
I like 'em 4:04
Hang on, "Pace Picante Sauce" is not chunky. They make Pace mild chunky salsa, and that ain't it.
No one? Really??? OK, I'll say it...


Her waist is tiny...  🤯 🤯 🤯 Nothing wrong with that, she's a beautiful girl, but damn (!!!) her waist is tiny!!!
My parents eat Pace. But, if I can't make the salsa myself I'll buy Herdez.
nah yall have no taste the only thing i have faith in ur taste test is  hottest candy chocolate
What is with the weird looks? You've never had sweet salsa? Mango, peach, pineapple? Those are my favorite salsas!! My favorite is mango habanero salsa, it's soooo good! Newmans own Mango is amazing too!!! I could go through a whole bag of chips, just eating that salsa. Plus, it's amazing on loaded nachos. My favorite food ever!!!!  😍😍😋😋
It's "paso" doble". Bye.
Thank you Rhett for eating the entire chip with each salsa taste.
8:00 link got us all!😂
I feel like I've seen them do salsa before
For me ketchup is ingredient. I never use it plain, but you can use it in food and it can be nice addation for custom sauce.
I love that she just knew what to say and when to say it.
The best salsas are homemade by grandma.
6:56 "Let's see if the taste is spooky" -Link 2019
Pace... Picante sauce, not salsa... It's supposed to be thin
Publix has the best salsa
If Eva is sick in the next couple days she can thank link for blowing in the salsa 8:40
They should try doing a salsa 2.0 with leesser known brands to see if they can find the holy Grail of canned salsa
Everyone's so impressed she knew what to say but most of their guests already know what to say. It's a bit they even do with the crew members. :p
pretty sure the whole foods was medium not mild
Omg I did not realize Eva was in this
This is the video that I have always needed
Please do a Nacho cheese dip taste test.
How is someone afraid of ketchup?
It’s like what comes on kids spaghetti 😂
Do Mediums.. and Spicys..also.
link has been lifting
rhett was so uncomfortable when she licked the bottle😂😭
Not feeling this chick sorry boys
This episode would not be possible without Link's hypnosis session.
idk if yall have julios in cali but its the best
No Mrs Renfrows makes this invalid, some of these are nasty
You guys should've done a blind tortilla chips taste test, then used the winner as the chip for this salsa test.
I noticed that Pace lost points for being watery. That may not have happened if they tried the Pace Chunky salsa instead of the Picante. Tostidos had the Chunky version.
I have a fear of ketchup too I thought I was the only one 💀
Wth la Victoria post to be the best
Newman's Own peach salsa and pineapple salsa, are the best!
Link being shocked shes knows the deal lmao
2:58 Rhett went full redneck “this is pretty thin SAUCE-A”
She looks like jar jar binks
Since none hit there salsa standards I vote for them making their own Mythical Salsa. Who agrees ? 🙋🏻‍♀️
Herdez is my favorite brand from the store
I thought this chick was cool until she hated on ketchup. Life is only life because of ketchup!
Is anyone else loving that they didn’t have to say, ‘Now you say You know what time it is’. 😍
rhett got dark there for a second. That was heavy man
I like how Rhett has to clarify that he would still eat all of them no matter what score he gives them. Yes, Rhett. We know you eat everything
Taste tests are my favourite kind of gmm shows and they will always be
Shoulda had some Mrs. Renfro's  easily the best larger brand salsa
Eva knows that good salsa has to be spicy!
You tried to say spicy
My birthday is Monday 😎
The guy wearing spectacle look very much like brendon urie
Was Eva the first guest to say "You know what time it is" without being told to do so?
Work on your salsa picking skills, 😀
FINALLY!! a guest said the phrase without being prompted.
Y'all should make an app called wheel of mythicality, like a game or something. Idk, it's just an idea. But I would definitely play it!
"Its like my life" - Rhett, I'm not the only one who caught that right?! 😄
I only know Eva from escape the night
Alot of ppl dont wanna watch the ehole thing give us a page with the answers
Eva and Rhett have a father daughter relationship and I’m living for it 😂😂😂
Thank god she knew to say “you know what time it is” I always get so frustrated when guests clearly haven’t seen the show before lol
the more link swears, the more i flourish
Damn, Link is looking so buff
Aldi has amazing salsa
Sadly you had only chunky: / mrs renfros, clints, mateos are super good.
WHAT ABOUT ARIIIIIIBAAA SAUCE
Hot Pace salsa it's the best at least one of my favorites.
The chemistry in this video made my entire day.
do will it nugget or chicken nugget
Sinco my mayo
Rhett’s a double dipper
Now I feel like nachos... 😂
Medium is spicier than mild on the spice scale. That’s why the Whole Foods one was hotter. It was a medium.
Phobia of ketchup. Ok then.
Double dip 🤢
Those name intros are dying...
To be honest, store bought salsas just aren't good. Haven't bought one that I actually love.
Frontera salsas are the best. I love Rick Bayless and his take on the cilantro pepper salsa.
wtf? where's the Ortega?
Everybody knows Pace is the best.
all she did was hate on everything and complained.
I'd rate them all vinegar
The best thing about this is that she didn't need a cue to say "you know what time it is". I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO DO THAT FOR BASICALLY FOREVER. Cheers Eva. Well done.
Can we get a guac episode!!
Tostitos wins! Glad I work for Frito Lay.
She’s so extra, swear.
I've never heard of this girl before and I'm not at all impressed. Her comments about "frat parties" and overly dramatic reactions was not funny or entertaining. Please just do these on your own next time!!!
Doritos salsa is best salsa 💗
No Mrs. Renfro's?  Fail
Garden Fresh is the best salsa ever, but it might only be a Michigan made one not sure.
Pace probably would've done better if they had gotten salsa and not picante sauce lol
How can y'all not know how Pace is pronounced?  Y'all must have seen those commercials!  "New York City?!"
Sadie’s salsa all the way
She just doesn’t like salsa 🤦‍♀️
Title: two tomato haters and one normal human rank tomato products.
The pace salsa was not even a competitor because in the picture it is the  mild picante style instead of wild chunky
Jarred salsa is a sin in my family.
I think the general consensus is that jarred salsa STINKS
No offense to this guest because she is really sweet and nice, but I don't really prefer guests on the show. It takes away the spotlight from Rhett and Link. 


I feel like guests can be included on the shows on Saturday or  the GMM more.
I love her shirt!
Y’all made me mad...
Just sayin, Pace has seeds (commenting after seeing the 365 salsa
Newman's Own was 13 lol.
To the lady who proclaimed "This smells like tomato sauce" every round.. yeah its tomato salsa, that's going to happen 🤦‍♂️
If link doesnt like tomatoes, then why does he like spaghetti and ketchup??
No. "You not right". Quit bowing down and cowering to that BS.
I even never heard of this woman. ._. Also Link Neal for 2020!
Eva is like..the first person who said "You know what time it is?" without rhett or link mentioning it
Conclusion: Grocery store salsa is just sad
I love how Eva was just like “You know what time it is!” And they both were like 😱
Who else skipped half-way though?
“ It looks good, it’s smell good,  the middle is real bad...just like my life” -Rhett
What about Chi-Chis?
My favorite salsa either has habanero, tomatillo, or is Fresh Gourmet Sweet Onion. Just pretty much anything that doesn't taste like ketchup.
tostitos is my go to fav
I like GMM. I like salsa. This is just a good day for me.
Technically it’s jarred not bottled lol
About time this happened!!!!! 🙌👍
Target spicy salsa is really good
Yes blind taste test!
Finally a good video i been waiting over a week
Links salt and pepper hair is the best part of my morning!
I love how she knows what to say ❤️❤️❤️
Herdez is my bottled salsa of choice
love all three of you ❤️😊 wish I could meet you
These are the men that get their salsa from New York
Pause @ 7:59
...
...
...
got'em.
I called this episode way back and they finally did it, very nice gmm
they are right in saying the picante version of Pace is more watery then if it was just original Pace as I've had this experience too and didn't like it over the original
People buy salsa on Amazon?
"It's time for..."

Goes to make a sandwich.  Comes back.  Title graphic still going.
Am I the only one that noticed link going first every time?
Rhett and Link, you guys are an important part of my routine. Not even just for the morning but to go to bed and you bring a smile to my face every video, so I had to share your channel with someone at work who had never heard of you. What better videos to share than going back to the Carolina reaper and the anti-cap? She subscribed right away and laughed so much. We had a good time enjoying your videos.
The best salsa is mateo’s gourmet
you guys should do the blind taste test and throw in a chef josh made dish into the mix and rate them!
Link quoted a song that I have been quoting for years.... exactly the way he did. "Let me clear my throat, bunanunanunana" If anyone can tell me the name of the song that would be freaking great! :D
Collab with Cristine from simply nailogical!!
Rhett reminds me so much of Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec. anyone else?
Frontera is the best
"we're going to use mild chunky for all the brands" proceed to eating regular mild pace and medium chunky whole 365...
7:34 😂😂😂 best joke
Why did Rhett go first every time?
10:16 look how focused Rhett is 😂
God that name is a mouthful. I can't even remember what the name of this episode was. XD
Tostitos FTW! 🌶🥙🌯
bottled salsa was your first mistake
I like how Rhett just keeps eating whatever
You guys should do some kind of languages video- recognizing languages?
Why is Tyga in drag??
I was actually laying in bed at 5am wondering what the best salsa was. Now all my questions have been answered
Link doesn't like tomatoes, yet he eats salsa and ketchup. #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmmm 😉
You guys enjoyed Tostitos????? Your opinions are invalid.
My favorite salsa isn't on here T.T
These people are weird 👀
no one: 
eva at every salsa: this smells like tomato sauce
salsa: literally tomato sauce
She’s absolutely beautiful jeez
What about On The Border? That's my favorite.
Tostitos hint of lime salsa and chips is my life blood
The only real good salsa is homemade. It needs chunks. Essentially pico de gallo.
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 82: "Boy, I'd hate to meet spicy on the street" - link
BEEF JERKY TASTE TEST
Can you guys get more people on who we know lol who dis girl
On the border is the best salsa
You forgot chi chi's!!
Trader Joe's salsa, is the best. It's more of a restaurant style, so not very chunky. Soo so good!
Aaaaaaaaw the double dip 🤮
no herdez or chi chi? pft next episode please
They should have included Walmart's brand, Great Value. It's the kind I buy, though I buy hot for myself.
Great clip!
U did the taste test wrong.
the tortillas need to be Doritos Nacho Cheese.
Why did you not go with Pace's chunky salsa instead of the picante sauce?
On the boarder salsa is like best every store carried salsa
I was really hoping Rhett would give the 365 salsa a 5 cause then they would’ve given it a 3, 6, and 5
if your buying salsa in person you might as well go to the deli area and get fresh made salsa that is all chunk
SOMEONE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS WITHOUT THE PROMPT!!!!
I hope none of these are made in New York City. If so, "get a rope" :)
9:00 LOL love it
Finally a guest that knew when to say "you know what time it is"
Do queso next!!! Please
I'm not sure what to do with this information since I have only ever seen one of these in stores in my country.
12:31 ... And we are in CHICKEN PIZZA México hahahahahhaha
shoutout wasn't fair so they had to induce the food part to make it =
I love the brand "on the border"
There was a missed opportunity to say “ Let’s taco ‘bout that “
Love how she said "You know what time it is" before they could say anything. They always seem to have to remind them. Such a fresh feeling.
Are we sure this girl likes salsa 😂
I once thought pace was pasta sauce lol. my son was not impressed in my defence I had a bad cold.
Has a phobia for Ketchup, right...
Suban videos en su CANAL español es que me encantan sus videos pero en español no en inglés 😭
This is the episode I was waiting for. I didn't realize I wanted it until I saw it.
I thought they all were supposed to be chunky mild? The Whole Foods was medium, and the Pace was their non-chunky version... Not quite the best comparison, but hey, still entertaining
5:51 does link know what salsa is made from
On the border salsa
pace is my fav
Tostitos is my fave salsa, cheese dip, and tortilla chips lol
Homemade is the way to go
Green Mountain Gringo is the best one!!!!
...aaaaand now I need to go to the store for some chips and salsa
Show me your paso doble
Omlllll i love you guys ive been watching since i was 5 i am now 9 thanks fpr all the good memories!!
7:40 OMG HAHAH
If she clear her throat it would take ten years😂😂🦒🦒
Sauce-uh
Hearing someone say “you know what time it is” without being told. That’s some good stuff right there.
I watch this channel on a daily and I love it, I always look forward to my mornings for these videos!!!!!! ❤️ 🥰 😊
I like them big, I like them CHUNKY!!!!
Some people have nightmares about ghosts, others about ketchup.
U forgot chi chis salsa. Consistently wins
I prefer the signature select medium salsa!!! Albertsons/Safeway store brand for the win!
I'm surprised On the Border salsa wasn't included. I really enjoy the medium variety because its spicy without being so spicy that you need something to drink when you eat it and its chunky, which I really enjoy.
Eva tomatoes are naturally sweet
I would have gone with medium instead of mild salsas.
People clicked the bell just to dislike it seems
I kinda wish link would have said „top that casanova“ at 12:13 :D
9:57 That’s what she said.
im eating chips and salsa rn omg, youtube is always watching
EVA!! Yess
rhett calls the organic "fakey".  might want to recalibrate your taste buds bud.
i love watching your videos and funny brightens my days. Newmans own is my favorite
Am I eating Sausa?
I'm surprised Rhett and link didn't go crazy the moment she said frat barbeque
Anyone else catch the Whole Foods jar saying medium, maybe that’s where the spice came from
I knew what all the salsas where just by the look
I like them big I like them CHUNKY
Best salsa is homemade!!
Ugh, should of told her what u were going to do! Don't think she contributed much!
12:25 YES!!
Her waist is so tiny!
Bruh. All. Salsa. Has. Tomatoes.
Oh my gosh yesss! I love Eva!
Cue Guardians of The Galaxy guy saying “Who???”
Chi Chi’s is the best
Y’all should have tried Mateo’s salsa. It is really good
rhett saying saw-sa is almost as bad as rhett saying ah-mond.
I've been waiting for this day for years, finally a guest said it without being prompted.
Should’ve done red gold hot salsa, that stuff is pretty solid
Does she not realize salsa is tomato based. Of course it will have a tomato sauce smell.
She’s adorable!
Is Link going senile?
My personal favorite brand from the grocery store is Chi chi’s mmm
This made me want chips and salsa 😋🤤
LONDON SALSA HAHA
Eva, where is your shirt from!? My girlfriend likes it.
Blind salsa taste test...no salsa in whole episode....
On the Border is my favorite store salsa. They should have tasted it too.
Frontera is sooo good
Pace has a chunky mild too
My fave is La Victoria
0:26 I-....
You had Pace "sauce", not Salsa. That's why it was so thin.
Holy forehead
I’ve only heard of Tostitos and Pace
This is exactly why I make my own salsa. I have yet to find anything on the shelf that matches what I can make myself.
this girl just doesn't like salsa
FIRST


Thursday of May 🌻
Will it Salsa???👀👀👀👀
I never thought of Tostitos being sexually harrassed.  Oh man............
Tostitties is the best!
Why does Rhett have a hard time pronouncing salsa and dolphin (previous episodes)?
I truly enjoy how Link thinks! totally how I think! very fun to see!
Link smokes?
Really!!! No avengers themed episode!!!
The actual best salsa is HT Traders chipotle salsa from Harris teeter
No more Collaborations
Negative Nancy 😒
Is it weird that I root for the brand that i eat?😂
What are these guests? No more.
If my salsa aint hot I'm not into it lol not into sweet tomato juice on my chips
FINALLY a guest who knows when to say "you know what time it is" without someone whispering it to them
she has more chemistry with them than i thought she would
Heredez is best
Now they just do this again, but with the refrigerated restaurant style brands.
Her facial reactions tho
pace-ew, tostios-ew, La Victoria-ew lol needs some texas salsa in there.
I refuse too eat any of these
I feel so sad that you can't really taste good salsas!! Salsa is not supposed to be ketchup with a flavor!! Anyway, you made me laugh as always!! 😎
I like how they all say that they smell like tomato
Pace... their SALSA is way better than their PICANTÉ sauce... way chunkier
Eva hates all salsa lol
I laughed harder than I should've at Link's Cinco de Mayo joke
You guys should do a best pet contest
i think i have a mental condition that makes me eat tostitos every day
🙁 I like pace
Newmans is so good. Wtf.
Eva is so pretty
R&L... We don't like guests this much lol. Too many guests lately!
I wish I was doing this
PSA: ANY GOOD SALSA WOULD NOT SMELL LIKE TOMATO PASTE OR TOMATO SAUCE.
Finally an actuall fan that watches the show. (religiously)
Whoa, that got real at 7:30
So mex imported beer next 💁
Over The Border hands down
Why dose link double dip that tiny little corner piece? Just eat the whole chip man total party foul
she always says she agrees then proves she does not....tricks!!! must be a witch
I love gmm, their videos, and the in house crews, but quite honestly there hasn’t been many guests that I liked or ever wanted to come back
They got them microphones way to close to there faces
Idt they like salsa too much
i would love to see you guys do a show with linus from linus tech tips
Salsa is an insult to corn chips 

I have my nachos with sour cream and cheese and that’s it
makes a Arizona tea joke the same day DLo gets cited
Mild salsa shouldn't even be a thing.
Tostitos is the best overall
Link actually eating tomatoes
Welp, looks like I'm going to have to eat chips and salsa for breakfast.
You guys! Some were Picante sauce and some were Salsa! There is a difference! Salsa is ALWAYS chunkier. You did it wrong! Make them all one or the other! Know your sauces!
La Victoria salsa name should change to La Defeato
prediction: newman’s or tostitos
I was going to be disappointed if Tostitos didnt win
You have to try Trader Joe’s Salsa Autentica 😱😍😍 it’s the best non-fresh salsa ever!
Goddammit i love this show.
You should’ve got chi chi’s salsa 💃🏻
That girl had a crush on Rhett she is so enticed by him
Who else is awkward when Rhett or Link interrupt the guests and the crew by accident?
I would love to be on the show
8:25 Me too Rhett me too!!
She was way too influenced by what they said before she tasted it
Hi class
Got a Chemistry final in 3 hours. Still, Gooood Mythical Moorniiinnnngg.
Pace original restaurant style is superior
On The Border salsa is where it's at!
I live close to London and I have doritos salsa
Can yall do spicy salsa
She doesn't like ketchup
“bottled salsa taste test”
Remember guys just find the bottom and give it a little peck.
Where is the Jack's Special? That is my favorite salsa.
I had chips and salsa for lunch today!
Has a good start and end but a bad middle "just like my life " Rhetttttt 🤣
Kroger brand salsa is SOOOO good
Some of these comments are painful to read. Jaysus.
This screams for a "will it salsa"!!!
If they live in L.A. then no, none of those will meet their standard of salsa.
"I'm just gonna find the bottom and give it a little peck" Rhett no
Litteraly eating chips and salsa right now and this just popped up on autoplay
The third looks like cocktail sauce
When salsas taste smokey it's because they were probably aiming for a style of salsa call Tatemada, which means the ingredients were put on the comal or grill to burn first.
ya'll need some good ol' New Mexican salsa.
The pace one, doesn't even say that it is chunky.  They should have let R and L know that b4 eating it.
This ones a no
Chi chi’s is the best though
Chi Chi's salsa is better than Tostitos because it's not too salty tasting..I wish they would have tried it..oh well it's all good
Am I the only one who hates the new intro?
More like MyLifeIsBoring
You guys need to have some Texas salsa. Try some Clints. Or some Joe T Garcia. All of these are disgraceful to the tastebuds
Y'all messed up. The best salsa is On The Border Chunky
Ok, I know I'm not alone in actually taking your opinions in to account when I grocery shop and I was just buying chips and salsa. I know my favorite chips already but I didn't with salsa and I thought "Rhett and Link should taste test salsa.." 
🤔😏
Mild = ketchup
So salsa is mainly made of tomatoes and they’re all surprised that they taste like tomato products?

Wow...
Guys please do some sims 4
The best salsa is doritos
this woman got no tastebuds smh...
You should do what queso is the best or guess the place the donut is from
She has the best set of front teeth I’ve ever seen LOL
#DoTheMilkshakeCompetition 🔥🔥🔥
Rigatoni toe cheese
505 Salsa is the best...
I just tried Mrs. Renfro's tequila salsa. So good! Much better than any other salsa I've tried. Old Dutch brand is okay. Now I'm eating chips and salsa.
The salsa you can get from Costco is pretty good. Any other brand doesn't match up to it, in my opinion.
Mild...you might as well dip in katsup
None of these brands exists in the UK so this test is useless to me but still fun to watch
Old El Paso mixed with sour cream, cream cheese, green peppers, green onions and topped with Shredded cheese... you're welcome
Finally someone who watches the show and knows her cue 👌👌👌
If you do lower yourself enough to go with processed, bottled salsa - Herdez is the only way to go.
🏆 TOSTITOS CHUNKY MILD SALSA 🏆

...is my everything
I saw link at the glendale mall he was with his two boys
Who doesn't like mole? :(
Mild salsa is, I feel, NOT the way to do a taste test. It'll just be tomatoes and vinegar, like ketchup. At least do medium salsa!
On the Border would have blown all of them away.
*2009 Eminem wants to know your location*
You used Pace Picante, not their salsa.
bring Eva gutowski on
Cool vid
Just for everyone, only let people from Puebla Mexico celebrate Cinco de Mayo por favor
Chi Chi's salsa is bomb
Right after I made some salsa and tortillas, this popped up on my notifocations. Are you guys spying on me? e.e
OMG IT'S EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tostios give me toasty toes
just buy real salsa lmao
You guys should try cheese dips for chips
not a fan of this youtuber guests that i've never heard of nor do i want to.
10:26 She eats a plain tortilla chip and then a few seconds later, she looks disgusted saying the salsa isn't that good  🤔
no mrs. renfros??
clints salsa is the best at the store thank u
YOURESOLOUD better do something with Rhett’s “oooo I like that” at 4:21
No no no not her, I'm leaving.
Sauce ah - Rhett
i like em big, i like em chunky
Eva who?
the best salsa-  Mrs Renfro's ghost pepper.   trust me
I am sick
Why is there no Doritos salsa
Why invite someone who doesn’t like ketchup onto a show tasting salsa????
I was half expecting the Doritos salsa to be in there! 😂😂
I think I’m going to become a member 😙
She looks like the main character from missing link.
Who's Eva?
Rhett said they were going to use chunky varieties and then immediately did not use the chunky version of Pace salsa...
I never know any of these guests
man tostitos is the best in my opinon because it tasts the most like my grandmas salsa and she does not make that stuff year round
The girl is the definition of millennial
Gorgeous
Tostitos wins because of all that salt lol
I normally don't comment on every GGM episode, but, sorry, this person/guest just had a "sour" face the whole time and would not be pleasant to hang around. But, I love R&L, so I watched the whole painful #1538 show.....
she should make dummer faces with every jar.... everyone of them is sweet.  I want to taste what she thinks is real good.
“It’s like my life”
I just watched one of ur old videos and I forgot u made music videos and they were so good
Exams Tomorrow but who cares.
Pace is picante sauce not salsa.
smoky water? fiery sky? deep violet? 8:40
“Is this the one that smelled like tomato sauce?” Girl. You said that about pretty much all of them!
I like Links hair!
Link is right, its /paché/, which means Peace.
Wait I thought you liked tomatoes now
Link looks like Garth from Wayne’s world
Do you guys have an aldi near you? Aldi has amazing fresh salsa. Do an aldi taste test! Maybe aldi will sponsor you guys!
Oooooohhhhhh I get it
My personal favorite is miss renfros habenaro salsa
Wal-mart has the best salsa in my eyes! Their organic brand is the best! I like the hot one, but medium is good too! It's funny because my friends and I did this taste test a few months ago....it was inspired by your taste tests!  You should do the best "cola" taste test.  I did that one with friends too....Aldi's brand won believe it or not!
Man, this episode was really disappointing. She didn’t even eat one of the salsas and made disgusted faces about each one. 🙄
I didn’t taste this one.. but I’ll give it a two.
I love Newman's and I'm not afraid of spice I love eating habanero peppers
Does she not know that there are tomatoes in salsa
Newman’s Own is my favorite!   ❤️
Love her!!!!
12:15 Rhett genuinely embarrassed by something others did for once hahaha
My fave store bought salsas are Old El Paso and Doritos.
Pace makes a chunky... that was not it...
My brother also has a phobia of ketchup
This woman has a fear of anything tomato.....loves salsa 🙃
GMM 2019: "Let's read pre-written prompts about thattttttttt!"
I'm so glad someone finally knows to say "You know what time it is" without them having to say it!
Love you Eva
Will it burger
Taste tests are usually some of my favorite episodes... but then I click on it and some random person says “Let’s talk about that.”  And I click away.
Chi chi’s is the best jar salsa.
You didn't get the best salsa, which in my opinion is chi Chi's salsa!
Why does she got a neck seam that makes her look like an oblivion character
Nothing beats homemade salsa
here's a question-does eating something like salsa one after the other without some sort of palate cleanse provide a fair representation?
America has so many brands of salsa in the UK its legit just dorito salsa or store brand salsa I swear XD
Old El Paso and CC's brand Salsa
Eva is probably supppper hard to please
doritos salsa is the elite
And also I thought link said he would know Newman’s
She does not know anything about salsa
Must be great to eat salsa first thing in the morning!!
Did they use picante sauce for the pace vs salsa?
I do t know if someone had mentioned this yet but the first one, pace picante sauce is a picante.  Which is not a salsa.   It is meant to be thinner than salsa.
The mythical crew should have made they blind taste test homemade Josh's salsa as well.
I always get tostitos salsa from Aldi!
She's pickier than Link.
Can you please do a Will it pizza or will it salad
Spicy salsa next?
My favorite store bought salsa is Herdez
Anyone else went straight to the comments
If anyone blind taste tested salsas to me, I’d know Tostitos in a heartbeat lol
How u gonna do a salsa taste test with someone that has a "Ketchup phobia?"
Pace is NOT a salsa...it's a sauce...just like it says on the bottle.
“It’s too sweet” they were all mild....
Mrs. renfros ghost pepper salsa is the best.
“He goes last”
I use Pase salsa it’s my favorite
Salsa aka tomato water.
Fact of the day: Salsa smells like tomatoes
I love the dislikes
Herdez is better than all of those.
I didnt llike her 'unsatisfied' attitude towards the salsas... like everything was gross or bad as if shes a damn salsa connoisseur rolls eyes
Gotta love all that wrong spanish 😂 great video as always. Love you guys
I thought link hated tomato
Link still thinks there is tomato in ketchup
Get red cactus sweet salsa, it's not spicy at all, but it is sooooooo good. I get it in illinois at walmart
Where was Old El Paso???
mmmmm boi i love me some salsa
I wish that they had Josh mix in a homemade version into these episodes.
Shes like a bubble head doll
I'll just enjoy some real homeade Mexican salsa
salsas is the same
Her waist is sooo tiny tiny tiny!
You should have got Trader Joes Salsa, 10/10
Wow god job Tostitos
Herdez is the best. I would win this challenge bc I have tried all kinds of store bought salsa. I’m such a salsahead. 😂 I make it all the time, I just LOVE it.
My favorite is on the border salsa
Eva knows what a good Mexican salsa should taste like; NO sweetness, NO mildness
We like salty, spicy and acidic sauces
Someone please tell Rhettt that "salsa"  has an L in it. Thank you.
1:40 that's not even true
much better episode without the bimbo
does ava wana wear some more makeup?
whoa whoa whoa  link, tmi
La Victoria tastes like dish water
"We'll be tasting the best salsa!"
"We'll be tasting only mild and chunky!"

Well, which is it? The best salsa, or mild and chunky? Can't be both.
I liked this video for the sole purpose that the guest said the wheel of mythicality line without being told for once 😭
I would watch good mythical morning I like will it chocolate
Y'all should have tried Chi-Chi's salsa! It's awesome!
Do it with restaurants salsa now
Was making salsa while watching this
The nice thing about living in Texas is we have a multitude of competent salsas in basically every grocery store.
I think they might just not like salsa...
I guess link is a good kisser then..
Vuelvan a su canal en español :'v
I too hate mole
beyoncè?
i like em big. i like em chunky
These are not salsas 🤢 closes to a salsa would be Herdez brand. I feel bad for anyone who believes this is salsa
Nr 2 is salta
Good morning Mythical Crew, hope you all have an FANTASTIC day!!🌞😍❤
I always thought it was Salsa chunky and not salsa tostitos, chunky :'v
It angers me that she dips the corner of the chips in the salsa
Rhett: Sawsa.
Does she even like salsa? 🙄
They licked the jar.
there's a really amazing, like 11/10 salsa made really local to where i live called hair of the ferret. i've been screwed over since having a medical condition where i can't eat spice anymore, but even the mild in this brand is so freaking flavorful and good that nothing else comes close now. you can order it online if you're really curious.
Do Eminem taste test
What about putting weird things in a food dehydrater maybe pizza?
I tried Tostitos once in uni when I couldn't find my usual salsa brand and it was AWFUL. It tasted very artificial, salty and canned. Maybe I bought a bad jar, because I refused to ever buy it again. Also, I like adding habenero sauce to salsa- it makes many of the cheaper brands taste great!
The video actually starts at @2:37. Until then its just worthless jabber.
You guys should have tried trader joes salsa! So good!!!
Oh man. I just want chips and salsa REALLY bad now!
I half expected Publix salsa to be here
is she serious with the tomato sauce comments... is this a joke. Am I being punked..??
This kind of thing doesn't really happen to me often, but this video made me crave some chips and salsa.
Having someone who is picky with tomatoes, judging salsa. Bad call.
Jarred salsa is nasty
They keep having guests that nobody knows
Uhh she’s the most random person to have on the show lol
And now they can’t afford their textbooks XD
I have the same birthday as Ava
Someone finally said “ you know what time it is !” Subscribed !
My mom's salsa is the best
from this video i also learned that the former lieutenant governor of CA is (i’m pretty sure) maggie bustamante’s dad
Literally eating la Victoria salsa watching this video...
I agree with link at 10:35...I've never found a brand that even comes remotely close to what you would find at any Mexican restaurant...or simply, one that actually tastes like it's made with normal ingredients and mixed well with at least some spice.
Going to McDonald’s anyone want anything
Nothing wrong with some la Victoria salsa
Good mytchical morning guys!!
the salsa is almost as bland as eva’s personality
I expected them to do a blind taste test and rate them.
She said it without a reminder!!
I prefer to make my own salsa because I can make it even spicier and a little chunkier.
Where's the pace picante
Aren’t tomatoes like the main ingredient in salsa? Lol
Finally a Guest who knew what you say at the end!!! :)
Mild :/
ASMR?
Naturally tostitos wins
Why does she look so sad
Let me clear my throat looking boy SpongeBob on shirt looking boy I play in dirt looking boy😂😂😂😂.
Salsa Brian
Pace is technically picante sauce not salsa... that’s why it’s thinner.
Labna
Watching this while eating pace salsa
I love salsa. I may not be Mexican but I will eat that up. Also Good Mythical Morning y'all!
i love that eva said you know what time it is without them telling her to say it. she knows what’s up
How do they think that the whole foods one is sweet, it has the least amount of sugar (and no sweeteners)... Guess it's bad because it doesn't contain any additives or fillers x)
Newman's Own cheese dip is Satan's vomit in a jar.
I love Newmans salsa
Good thing Link was hypnotized to love tomatoes
I think we just learned that all salsa is pretty bad.
Whose the alien in the middle?
It’s time to eat pepper X
“Hello my name is spicy... OoOoOo”
You guys should have included Donkey salsa, I love that brand, tastes a lot like you just made it yourself.
I love Tostitos!
Pace is so gross lol
We make our own salsa
please do will it pancake!!!
I saw you guys live in Nashville!!! It was super awesome. Good job guys. Will you be releasing any of those songs in music video form?
Why the Americans celebrate 5 de Mayo.? It's not a big deal here in México, just a battle against France located in Puebla. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
I think all mild salsas has a watery tomato sauce taste
You did not use Pace Salsa.   You used Pace picante sauce, which is meant to be thinner.   You should have tried actual Pace Salsa.
Mild salsa is for mild people
No respect
Everyone’s talking about how Eva said the salsa smelled like tomato sauce, but Link said that it smelled like tomato sauce the salsa before. Jeez people, give her a break.
Now I want salsa.
She's fiiiinee
My name is Ava but people always spell it like Eva. Hmmm...
No On the Border salsa? It's the real winner
Why is everybody calling it "salsa" whats the difference between it and "sauce"??
She added nothing to this episode. It would have been better without her
she knows whatsupppp!! 😆
They should've given them On The Boarder salsa.
She didn't even try the salsa properly, I'm sure she's the kind of woman that goes to a taqueria and asks for tabasco.
Newmans own pineapple salsa or On the border salsa. My two favorites. Tostito salsa is DISGUSTING 🤢
They always just pick the most popular stuff, when none of that is ever actually the best. Pace and Tostitos both have much much better variations of their salsa.
Awesome
Salsa is not salsa without cilantro Im not a fan of any can salsa
Next do tortilla chips lol
Shes cute.
they do not like salsa
I have not seen the video yet but I already know that it's going to be the best I'm going to see today!
I wonder what mythical crew member hearts some of the comments
im sorry but if i got ketchup instead of salsa id cry
I think she thought the point was to make fun of them all...
Time for tortilla chip taste test
Love ur vids Rhett and linj
Did she double dip???
La Victoria actually has a variety called "thick n chunky" which the "Suprema" is not.
Eva is too harsh
Where's the Doritos one?
Let’s talk about that
She might be pretty, but she exaggerated a lot
7:18
Lol eva so funyy
A lot of makeup
I grew up on Pace Picante Salsa. We put that stuff on everything. 
Eggs? Yes
Tacos? Yes
Rice? Yes
Burgers? Yes
You get the picture
I,m Mexican
All of these salsas are bad
Why did I think this video was old?
I like them big
I like them chunky
You want good salsa try real maexican salsa salsa verde habanero with mango not the deal in a can
Why so many 👎🏽. What was wrong with this episode?
Tostinos salsa is trash
No Chi Chi's salsa .........
Finally the first person to say it without being told to.
so they didnt like any of them lol
I’d like to see you guys try mango salsas or pineapple salsas because those are amazing!
Now compare restuarant chain salsas!
Wait a second... so you’re telling me that the salsa, with main ingredient being tomatoes, smells AND tastes like tomato sauce!? Who would’ve guessed.
What the heck, these are all IN JARS!
You have to judge chunky pace salsa vs. chunky if every other kind is chunky they make chunky pace.
The Pace version they tried is not a salsa, but picante.  It is not chunky or thick  It was what was available when I was a kid.
not sure who she is but she just got her lips done and i cant stop looking at them
She looks good
She says it's so sweet and tomato tasting hmmm does have any idea what salsa is
The pace salsa looked thin because they were eating the picante version, not the chunky version.
I prefer to make my own salsa, personally. Most store bought salsa just doesn't do it for me. It's either too spicy or too watery. Homemade salsa is the best!
She looks like a Fallout 3 character...
3:15 Rhett almost gave his barbecue rant
Omfg the guest didn't need to be told to say you know what time it is
So this chick is surprised that a good that is 90% tomatoes tastes like tomatoes? Ok:
I wrote a letter and requested this. Unfortunately it seems there is no good store salsa? I bought 5 salsas from Walmart and didn’t like ANY of them. Really bad lol
Where’s On The Border?
why would you get pace picante when you specifically said chunky salsa? they do make chunky salsa, you know?
You guys need to try to get Andy samberg on
When I see a good video of GMM then I see that they have a guess so I decide not to watch
Missing the La Costena
she kinda looks like a female sharpe but pretty (youtube "music producer")
Nothing is better than Kramer’s salsa
Why they invited her, she doesnt like salsa or tomatoes for that matter
The reason they’re saying they taste like tomato sauce is because bad salsas have a cooked flavor, not a fresh tomato flavor.
Next Brent
They didn’t do Costco spicy mango salsa :( I’m a little hurt
Never bring her again.
She doesn’t has a phobia of ketchup, she just doesn’t like it
Where was On the Border salsa?
Gmm is makes me feel so childish but so sophisticated at the same time
Her hair looks ridiculous
Thats not... fair? Tostitos is specially MADE for chips n salsa. And nachos. THe others are salsa for GENERAL use. >_< Really?
What's the point in having salsa if you're going have mild salsa?  You might as well have ketchup.
I’m sorry Ava I really like your YouTube Chanel but that hair looks like ramen noodles the bun is on fire but it does I’m sorry
Is she that picky with men too?
Chi-che-nit-za
She was way too irritating for me to enjoy the show as much as I normally do.
What were Link's good guesses? He said he would know Newmans when it came up, he didn't. He actually hated that one lol. And when he guessed Newman's it wasn't that one.
be with pewidiepie
I think you guys have sadly overlooked a very underrated part of the salsa which would be the delivery mechanism. You have to have a well balanced chip that isn’t too thick and also isn’t over salted... the chip contributes to the overall salsa enjoyment much more than people might think
Tostitos and Pace are the best tbh sometimes i like a watery salsa but only with a super salty chip cause the salsa washes away some of the salt but also makes the salsa taste better. Also, sometimes I just like to dip rather than scoop. I'm like Rhett, either way the whole jar is getting eaten lol
Who are these random Youtubers I've never even heard of? Let's get someone most people know
😁
I am a "eat a whole jar of salsa on my own and then go for more" type of gal. The chip is the means to eat salsa without being judged, otherwise I'd probably just spoon it. Hands down, the best salsa, to my surprise, is the organic great value medium salsa.
The La Victoria looks like salsa they serve in school cafeterias
This is why guac is better
Hi random person scrolling through the comments!💚Have an awesome and positive day and a peaceful and good night's sleep!!💚 Love truly from an artist youtuber!😉

Chichén Itzá
Everyone moaning about them saying it smells like Tomato sauce..like there arent things in salsa that arent more aromatic than a tomato like garlic, onions and cilantro, as well as peppers..if salsa smells like tomato sauce still thats not good.
You guys should go salsa while eating chips and salsa
"Find the bottom and give it a little peck."
She seemed cool, gave HER opinion just like the guys did & knew the closing line without being told 😊👍🏾❤
Girl is afraid of tomatoes?
Mole salsa? wtf are you talking about.
Watching on Cinco De MAYO
I love pace salsa
Guess what that red stuff is....tomatoes. Thus, it will smell like tomatoes. That girl needs cultured.
She is so damn picky
I like her! She’s great!!!
Someone tell her that salsa is made from tomatoes
Someone needs to tell Eva that she doesn't like salsa
"This smells like tomato too". Uhhh...it's salsa.
Double dip... gross
I also use tongue when kissing and then go to the bottom for a peak😉😉😉
She's REALLY unlikable
No Chi-Chi's salsa?
Yall need to do an episode with David dobrik!!
where is xochitl
Eva’s name should be in the title of the video.... just saying
Picante is a lot thinner than Salsa...
Seems like they picked the wrong person to try multiple salsas with
how come they didn’t guess which one was which
mmmm.. saw-sa
the second salsa rating gmm episode
She's bad at this.
I love GMM but man idk about this one episode but the girl was getting on my nerves lol
She's cute
She's cute
Nasty! She was double dipping when they were tasting Whole Foods at 6:53.
Wooooohooo!!!
Corn doesn't belong in salsa
The only day of the year Link eats Tomatoes
Seriously, where in London did you get served ketchup salsa? As someone who absolutely hates ketchup but loves salsa, that is not a common thing here.. That was just a bad restaurant that needs to be avoided!!
Did you have to bring her? She's just too much..
I think she’s used to actual salsa. Like the kind that you get at a Mexican restaurant for your chips.
Whats with all the dislikes?
I'm actually tempted to put minced onion in ketchup now.  Not to pretend it's salsa, but just to see what it tastes like.  I bet it would be great on burgers.
sorrry but the only salsa i eat is red gold blck bean and corn.
Have anyone else noticed how the guests seem to be more comfortable around rhett? 😂
Anyone else not getting notifications?? I have my bell on, but i will only get gmmore notifications like 7 hrs later. So weirddd..
The only thing that could have made this better is to have josh make some to compare to the rest
Now I want salsa, Mexican food
Sometimes when they do these collabs I forget who’s channel I’m watching
Ya'll really did Pace wrong by putting it first. Always put the best options first it doesn't get an accurate rating. You put Pace last, it wins every time.
DO A COLLAB WITH STUDIO C OR JK STUDIOS!
Finally a guest you dont have to tell tonsah you know what time it is. I've been waiting!😂
you guys got village salsa over there 
thats some good salsa
what if Trader Joe's has the best salsa
Love u guys
7:39 rhett tells a joke but no one cares. lol
So I am learning Latin and Spanish is a root language from Latin so it’s either (pa-ch-ae) or (pa-s-ae)
Love Newman’s medium salsa
She doesn't like salsa dips. Her face says it all. Lol
There was a time in my life when I thought Tostitos salsa in a jar was actual salsa lol.
I love Pace salsa
This makes me low-key proud that we've never bought anything but the Tostitos brand.
Can yall stop bringing mentally disabled guests on this show?
What is salsa supposed to smell like ? 😳 I thought is was tomatoes so why would it smell like anything else ?? 😑
Yeah she doesn't seem to be a good fit for this episode... she wasn't having a good time at all :(
For some reason it made me really happy when Eva didn’t need to be prompted to introduce the wheel, she’s awesome.
WTF is wrong with this chick?
I literally want to be on GMM just so that I can say, “You know what time it is,” without being asked/prompted.
Walmart brand “market side restaurant style mild salsa” is the best salsa in my opinion
The fact that she automatically said “ You know what time it is!” At the perfect time made me smile so big😂
This video was going so good until link started tonguing the salsa😂😂😂😂
Link: "boy, I'd hate to meet spicy on the street!" 🌶️🌶️🌶️
"sure lets double dip" got me in the giggles today =).
Should’ve done Kirkland’s
Would have been the perfect episode to have Max Greenfield on lol.
For someone who doesn’t like tomatos link knows quite a bit salsa brands 😂
Does anyone remember when they actually use to talk about stuff...
To the people that keep mentioning how they hate guests not knowing when to say the closing sentence, you can rest easy now. Eva did it, aight-
Newman's is my personal favorite salsa that isn't home made
If he/she can't do Mole...they aren't the one.
Newman’s own mango salsa is my favorite😍😍
The Pace was the sauce not the chunky salsa.. lol
“i don’t like smokey unless it’s with the bandit.” That made me feel old
I like spicy food but I actually prefer mild salsa I could eat a whole vat of it
What's up with the trypophobia in the intro?
On the border salsa is the goat
What kind of men eat mild salsa? YOU MONSTERS!
can't watch this, disliked the video for my honesty.
FINALLY!!!! The first guest that they DIDN’T have to tell to say “YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS” because SHE knew what time it WAS!!!!
“It looks good, it ends good, the middle is real bad... just like my life”
Aw Rhett 😶
7:40 Rhett has a millisecond midlife crisis..
Great episode!


 Costco Kirkland Salsa = Best Store Bought Salsa
Jarred... not bottled. “Mason Jar” “Jam Jar” both glass.
Why did you use Medium salsa for Whole Foods instead of Mild; as they are all supposed to be.. lol

Medium is spicier than Mild, not a re-wording.
Bottled Cheese Taste Test next?
Why dont they put the features in the titles anymore
What about chi chis
Is it bad that I don’t like salsa or guacamole or anything like that.
I’m not a dipper.
Moto likes you. He likes them chunky
my birthday is cinco de mayo
Chi-Chi’s salsa is where its at. Surprised that didnt make it on the show
“Hi. I’m Rick”
They all look like marinara where are they getting these
Salsa is canned, I stand by my opinion on this.
My entire life has been spent being called crazy by my family because I hate tomatoes but I like ketchup. Link validated me today.
She was fine. The rest of y'all need to chill.
I really like this guest . I hope she can come back again 💜
Loved the guest and the episode!! I’m a verde salsa fan though
blind protein powder taste test. What brand is the best? or Protein bar. Which tastes the closest to a candy bar with best nutrition? PLS!!!
Yo




God loves you ❤️❤️❤️
lmao “pache” would be italian.😂
Finally someone that knows the show and says the ending with being propped.
I think I suggested this. Yay
Rhett's love of eating is inspirational ^_^
Like my life ☹️
The Pace wasn't chunky salsa. You guys had the picante sauce. That's thin for tacos and enchiladas.
Eva: if its spicy i love it, if it's mild I hate it.  Me: if its spicy i hate it if its mild i love it! its opposite
Rhett is definitely saying “saw-sa”
Do sour cream next
Herdez is the best store salsa.
Pizza rolls with salsa is fabulous ❤️🍕
We got some salsa critics here!!!!
A fear of ketchup???
You have to come to Texas to get decent salsa.
Ive had all of these and i think pace is the best (hot).
Most salsa i get is too god damn sweet.
🌶
They should’ve gone with mediums instead of milds. They complained that they were too sweet. It’s salsa, gotta have some spice.
2:04 ayyy she ment doble paso, my girl know her stuff 🔥😂
I LOVE that they were so surprised when she went right in with "You know what time it is"
No Chi-Chis? I'm scandalized.
I don’t see Herdez in the picture, so idk if any of this is gonna be valid.
Chi-Chi's is the best mass produced brand. Jack's Special Salsa is the best salsa I've ever bought from a grocery store.
When I already know the guest’s YouTube channel. This is the first guest I can say that for
I'm from New Mexico and your salsa choices hurt my soul.
What a drama queen.
OMG my friend!!
I like all the younger guests you guys have been having on the show
Chi chis cilantro salsa is the move yall
Shes very Beautiful
I love Tostitos m
I really wish I could offer Ava some real salsa I’m a bit of a Connoisseur as well and I know that all the salsas they tried are trash
I think that just hate salsa
its jar'd salsa.
what a picky eater
They didn’t put any ft. sign on the title for Eva!?!?
Anyone feel like investing in a life that needs alot of help, yet loads of potential?.. can't seem to find my foundation after my divorce..
Why would you buy mild salsa?
I sometimes want to buy a bunch of items and send it to good mythical morning so they could try it against their brands in California Texas brand they’re just so much better looking I want to see if ours tastes better too.
The Newman’s salsa: the smokyness is literally just liquid smoke it’s on the ingredients. There are no cigarettes involved
Tostitos is my personal favorite glad the guys agree lol
No Chi Chi's?  Invalid!
FINALLY A GUEST JUST KNOWS TO SAY "You know what time it is!"
we all knew tostitos was gonna win
Moto Moto approves of the chunky salsa
she knew when to say "you know what time it is" !! 
we love an educated guest :P
On the border is really good.
The main take away from this video seems to be don't get your salsa from a jar lol
Aldi has the best Salsa,its called Smoky Serrano or something like that.their Chipotle Lime is also very good. :)
Once again guys, the seeds of a pepper only hold the oils of the pepper on the outside. The seeds themselves don't have any spice.
No On The Border salsa? Wtf kind of taste test is this then???
Oh yeah baby a taste test that matters!
I work for the company that makes pace lol y’all got the wrong one should of got our mild thick and chunky salsa pace picante sauce isn’t salsa
I love Tostitos Queso
Based on this episode of salsas not living up to your expectations I think you need to have cooking competitions with the mythical crew! Test and see which crew member makes the best salsa. Later you can test many other dishes and even desserts!
If I'm gonna recomend an episode to someone that has never watched gmm which episode should i choose for them?
Rhett double dinked back into the Newmans, fricking gross
Moral of the story: American salsa is bad.
Salsa is just one of those foods that has to be homemade.
The joke that link said Smokey with the bandit made my day thank you 😂😂❤️
How do u guys put so much salsa on one chip and then not even eat the entire thing🤢
I'll eat one inch of salsa and eat the entire chip
Pace is the best, I'm disappointed
"it must be impossible for a spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa."
need a super cut of all that snarky side eye everyone was giving..
I always wondered if a guest would say “You know what time it is” without being told to say it.
Haven’t ever found a jar salsa I liked.   Fresh for me.
You guys, Mama Lupe's hot. The best.
Mrs. Renfros and red cactus are better than those
Because people like to say salsa
I don't know if it's just because of how and where I've grown up, but I cannot imagine me enjoying a salsa that has the consistency of Ketchup or a sweet taste. 

In Texas and New Mexico, it's typically spicy, even in the mildest of forms, so any salsa lacking a chunky, slightly watery, and freshly chopped tomato and onion (and whatever else is usually incorporated)  texture and spice typically falls flat in appeal. 

Not to fire shots, but in my experience in the eastern states like VA and SC, the standard for salsa has appeared to be  equivalent to that of a sweet and pasty form of salsa lacking any "kick."

On another note, if you are in a region that typically refers to queso as "cheese dip," you can expect that queso and the accompanying salsa to be "meh" at best.
Wonder where they got salsa in london...
some of yall in the comments clearly havnt had authentic Mexican salsa and i feel bad for you
Man that chick is wierd looking......
12:28 Rhett looks like he doesn't even know what to do
Pico de Gallo > salsa
Have a ver(y)de Good Mythical Morning
Who?
Is it just me or is there a reasonable difference between picante sauce and salsa? Pace shouldn't have been in this unless they used the salsa, not the picante sauce.
Have y’all done a chocolate milk taste test?!?! IF NOT YOU SHOULDDDDDDD
Mild salsa isn't salsa. It's pureed pico de gallo. Spice or no salsa.
Where did you go in London that you had bad salsa? I'm guessing a Spoonies.
I love Pace so I will pace myself to watch this episode.
I still think that Salsa Lisa is my favorite
She said it... Thats right...Spread the mythicality...WE ALL KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!!! Right,beasts? :)
When your critiquing things it’s not complaining-it’s giving your opinion on the taste/ smell/ appearance. She’s fine and y’all are whiny.
I thought Rhett would talk about public colleges again
Guys can you have dantdm on the show plz
So exciting when a guest comes on having done their research/watches the show regularly and says "you know what time it is" without being prompted to!
Thinks the cheapest salsa is the best. Like what?
Pace has an actual salsa though! They got the picante sauce, not the chunky salsa!
4:52 I'm pretty sure she's describing Brent
Food Fears with Eva and tomatoes?
Why do so many of you skip episodes just because there's a guest? That's not being your mythical best.
Her guess about Newman’s is SO TRUE
Saying you have a fear of ketchup but would eat an entire bowl of salsa, is like saying you have a fear of dogs and own a pet wolf.
Some of these comments are such a disappointment to mythical beasts, and also making fun of something they themselves are not informed about. Salsa is not just tomato flavoured dip.
Target brand salsa is better
can someone please explain what that was...the name of the salsa thing
how do people get so many likes!
*hunkers down and really enjoys Rhett saying “sa-sa” the whole time.
I love Eva’s rapport with the guys!! 👑👑👑👑❤️❤️❤️
Been suggesting this for a while now! Thanks for doing it 😆
Being from texas these all look gross to me lol
That's what Pace calls chunky?  It looks like soup.
My fav, ChiChi's, didnt make the cut :/
I love double standards lol
This also isn’t fair because ya’ll don’t like spicy
Finally a guest knows when to say the outro.
They have weird tastebuds lol i learned that tomatoes smell like tomatoes..
Where the store brand salsas at. BYMB
Should have actually used the Pace Salsa.
Why are you double dipping.....................
She is just the female version of Link. Haha. Good episode, as usual. Have a GMM,GMM.
who?
I think they should take the average of their scores instead of the total. I feel like one person has too much influence by totalling the scores.
Who is this woman
Who the heck would want to watch this woman on YouTube?
Try restaurant salsas like Chile’s... it’s the absolute best!
Who is this woman?
link hates tomatoes but loves salsa.....
Should try a Nacho Cheese version for the next one
Good episode but this guest didn’t vibe like some of the greats. Cool person but not a lot of chemistry here.
Link turned into George Bush jr. at 9:24
hope you do sour cream and onion because I struggle to find the right one for me.
Petition to have no more guests on the show!
YOu mixed up by buying a picante sauce for the Pace Salsa. You need to get salsa. Picante sauce is not as thick,
I really do like her as a feature! And her posture is amazing lol! I've been waiting for a guest to say "you know what time it is" before they could tell them too, finally!
“You really wanted to say four, don’t let us influence you” - Rhett using his double influencing powers.
I just don't think they like salsa lol
Now do the same with hot. Pace is the best there.
They didn’t test mrs.renfros );
Why have they never messed around with one of those thing that u use to make home made soda making weird carbonated drinks
All those brands have the same nasty flavor is better the home made always
No El de paso?
hi
Ugh why didn't they guess tho
Ok when was Rhett and Link 41 and 40 years old???? Wtf? They were just like 33!
Dem lips tho
Aldis blind taste test
Salsa has tomato in it. I thought Link didn’t like tomatoes.
🎵Maybe cause I'm Bottled Up🎵.
Next time on Food Fears :
Eva tries Ketchup
Loved the guest today!
Sooo can we get Zachary Levi to come back sometime 😂
Get mo vlogs on the show
Those are clearly jars.
I thought Buttowski
For me it’s a tie between pace and Tostitos BUT it has to be chunky!
So Link does not like tomatoes anymore?
I like em big
I like em chunky
Link, my brother! I thought we were of a mind regarding tomatoes, the most evil of fruits. But now I see you eating salsa! I'm not mad, just very disappointed. 😞
I don't think she likes salsa...
I think the moral of the story is just say no to salsa in a jar. There a a few specialty jar salsa that I like but I’m a big fan of the one that was made in the deli of the grocery store.
GMM veiwers: Ninja was sooo picky for not drinks this disgusting drink.
Me: At least he would've eaten ketchup.
I just had an idea. Now sure if anyone else has suggested it. For games like this, why doesn't their cook (forget his name) make his own version of the food they are eating? In this one they said that they didn't really like any of the entries... maybe the cook could blow them away.
I'm not sure she actually likes salsa.
Why aren't they tasting a single Mexican salsa?!
this girl is picky and negative, eww
9:54 if rhett ever met me in real life.
where is green mountain salsa??
Is Link AntMan?!
*laughs in Mexican
Link is very explosive today lol
Best salsa will always be Walmarts/sams clubs Italian Rose fresh cilantro salsa
No "On the Border"????? Best salsa
Best canned salsa is Joe T Garcia’s or Clint’s
Target brand Hot Salsa is amazing!
Not going to lie, I read the title as bottled salad and didn't think anything of it.
i’ve always wondered if they’ve filmed episodes but never aired them for some reason.  i would like to see all of those lol
Is she the first guest to say "You know what time it is!" without being told to...?
Store bought SALSA SUX
She was a great guest!
Why is he calling her Ava? Is that how she says it? My daughters names Eva too but we say eeva...
“Chizta-nitza mexico” y’all....what....
That’s not real salsa guys. Come on Josh!
Don’t like her
Do you think your viewers around the world really care about American salsas?
so strange she doesn't want to eat the salsa cuz it tastes weird so she gets a bite but only takes a little bit of the chip so she's getting all the salsa and then dislikes it think about what you're doing first lady
everyone's saying "it's salsa, it's made of tomatoes" but like... there's more than just tomato. it shouldn't smell like someone just made tomato sauce and that's it. even tomato soup isn't that tomato-y
You don’t like salsa if you cant even try some of them lul
You got someone who doesn’t like salsa to judge salsa 😂
Thank you Rhett for keeping the kiss PG.
I knew which one was going to win from the start!! but I was surprise of the Whole Foods score.
"... Let's kiss it....you wanna go first?" Holy innuendo Batman!!
"Hi I'm someone you haven't heard of and I'm going to try too hard"
That’s a lot of tomatoes link just consumed 🤔
"This smells like tomato sauce!" It's almost as if it's made with tomatoes!!!!!
Eva 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Will it mayo?
No salsa from a Jar is good.
ketchup phobia???? wtf.
Tostitos is my brand !!!!
i likem em big i like em chunkeh
What is molay? (Sp?) Aussie here
Just watch the video and enjoy or stop watching if all you do is complain about the guest, yeah she talks about a phobia of ketchup, but she ate or tasted each sauce and commented on them along the way, while there have been other guests that don’t eat at all or don’t vibe with them, what’s actually wrong with this episode that you feel the need to hate her in the comments?
Does America not have Doritos Salsa dips?
How can you look like her and be that full of yourself?
I make my own salsa
I eat a lot of pace salsa. They 100% did not use the chunky pace salsa. They used the original pace. They even used the orginal pace picture. The chunky pace salsa looks exactly like the Tostitos salsa. The original is more I guess you can say watery like they one they used. The original is the one I prefer.
Wait how come there comment section isn't disable?😞
Please guys stop with the whole “salsa is tomato” Jazz,
To see Link demonstrate the showering process, check out his tutorial here! https://www.instagram.com/tv/Bw7CfWunCwq/?igshid=m2iv3x9bguwr
My favorite part is the entire video where Rhett is so uncomfortable for almost 14 minutes straight
I liked this episode. This could be a new bit called "Links guide to doing normal stuff."
"I am a sweet peach who knows his worth" should be a shirt 😂
Mythical Crew: *scattered applause after Link finishes singing*
Rhett: Really?

😆
Link: That's not accurate, that's just so we didn't need to blur anything."

Rhett: sips tea
Rhett is definitely not in the mood for Links bs today 😂
i feel like this whole episode was a fever dream that rhett is gonna wake up from in the middle of the night screaming 😂😂😂
"I am a sweet peach who knows his worth"
describes link perfectly
9:26
If it hides, expose it
If it flops, lift it
Best part in this video 😂
"If it flops lift it ... I'm speaking for grandmas here too" 9:32
I've always advocated for more Rhett Conspiracy Theory episodes but now I need more Link Instructional episodes!!! Love it!!! 🤣🤣
3:42 "You don't want to end
 your session shimmying naked and freezing on the bath mat to fetch a towel" for anyone wondering
I actually used Link’s tips when I showered today, thank you Link
I feel like GMM is getting more and more PG-13 as time goes on to keep up with their original audience.
Rhett is literally like "why are we friends?" this whole video, lmao. Best Friends through all the weirdness. I need a relationship this strong in my life.
If it hides... EXPOSE IT

If it flops.. L I F T  I T

-Link 2019
“I am a sweet peach who knows his worth” iconic
Just when I thought Rhett's theories were going too far, Link comes in with the same thing but for showering..
(facepalms)
Link had a good time. 


Thats all that matters! :)
Link you forgot about the blowdrying ur nether region in the drying process😂
I'm so happy to see Link get revenge on Rhett for all of those Conspiracy Theory videos!
Rhett’s energy this whole episode has been me all week.
I actually laughed harder as this than any rhett conspiracy theory videos
Links version of Rhett’s conspiracy theories 
WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Shoutout to Davin! Both his appearances cracked me up!
Me: sees a video was uploaded and without reading the title clicks on it
Link: are you showering perfectly?
Me: what is life
This is probably one of the funniest video they’ve made. I love how their energy is completely opposite
The squijee(sp?) part made me crack up so hard I was crying through the rest of Link's presentation. Rhett and Link really have a gift for bringing laughter and joy to people. Bless them 😂
This is my boyfriend's logic. Got the same speech 5 years ago.
no one:

literally no one:



Link:  iF it HidEs EXpoSe iT iF it FloPs LIfT It
It's not hard to believe that they've come this far since 2012 episode 1! I knew ever since I watched episode 1 something great had started! I even remember the name. My OCD morning routines.😊😊😊
Rhett for the first 4 minutes😀😁😃. Rhett after 4 minutes😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
This episode was so strange 😂😂😂
Rhett's disappointment in link and confusion in the whole episode is my constant state of mind.
7:43 That was a real KNEE-SLAPPER
Omg I thought I was the only crazy person who squeegees my body with my hands before i grab a towel. Baahahaha 👍
Omg we need more link instruction videos 🤣
We need more Link “Instructional” videos!!! 😂 This was SO great!
I REALLY want to see more of Link teaching Rhett how to live life.
Finally! Someone else that squeegees! I've been doing it for years and I thought I was the only one.
Is Link going to be aggressively teaching us things we should know in the future?
Real OG's know "the moment of nakedness should always be minimized" goes all the way big to good morning chia lincoln
This was the perfect episode! Entertaining, inspiring, highly informative, and hilarious all at once 👏👏
“I am a sweet peach who knows his worth.” -Link Neal 2019
Nobody: 
Literally Nobody:
GMM: YOU'RE SHOWERING WRONG
Rhett was literally hypnotized with Links singing and honestly I was too. 😂🖤
I saw the $1,000,000 and just said to myself ‘yeah that’s seems like a good estimate.’




I study Maths
I just can't! Haha! Rhett is so perpetually concerned throughout this video!
We need more life advice from Link!
This is what happens when rhetts like yeah link you can do an episode 😂
8:49 This whole video could just be  Rhett saying okay with the most done expression, after everything link says.
This was EPIC, we need more link tutorials Please 😃💙🤘🏽
99% of comments is about link 
0.50 is this and the other 0.50 is GMM’s comment.
imagine photoshopping your boss naked with female genitalia for him
This video should be called Link being himself for 14 minutes and 5 seconds!
Well, link has been narrating my showers now... if it hides, expose it
I love how visibly uncomfortable Rhett is this whole entire video. My best friend and I are very much like this.
Now Rhett knows how his conspiracy theories feel like to link.
Instructions unclear ended up with a missing kidney.
When I saw Link’s pointer, I was already laughing so hard. This is his revenge towards Rhett’s conspiracy theories. 😂
This just reiterates my thought of Link being crazy.
That lightning effect won me over i was bummed at the prospect of a link forward ep but it redeemed itself early.
Rhett was the best part of this Link episode.
"If it hides, expose it. If it flops, lift it". Wow. Such wisdom, I'm tearing up
I LOVE IT. WE REALLY NEEDED RHETT'S CONSPIRACY THEORIES COUNTERPART. BLESS LINK.
These last few episodes have been particularly hilarious, keep it up lol
Bless you for the edgier content lately, would love to see it continue! Wasn't expecting nudity this episode lol
this episode was just absolutely hilarious😂quality content right there
what if this was the first episode of GMM someone watched
Video idea
How to poop!
If they already did it, I’m not surprised
LInk's Industrial Engineering nature is coming through in a weird way ~Signed current I.E. fan
Are you showering perfectly?




Link has verbally attacked me over every single thing I like.
Honest at the towel and squeegee parts I was just nodding saying yup that's exactly right lol. I thought everyone did those already 😂
I’m a strong advocate for showering in the evening, not morning. You should get clean before getting into bed.
This episode is pure f-ing GOLD!
This is one of the funniest episodes by far!
Rhett's expressions are PRICELESS xD
I feel like during this entire video, Rhett was thinking
"Why am I friends with him?"
Rhett clicked thumbs down as this was uploading.
LMFAO. I'm in love with how much Link is enjoying himself 🖤💋
3 seconds before: oh dear wonder why there's a noticeable dislike amount 
13 min later: //dying from everything
The funny thing is that 
Links has the pointerrrrrrr 😅😂🤣😆😁😄😃😀
Rhett's face this whole video and Link's enthusiasm in this whole video 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Rhett just looks so freakin confooozled by this whole thing...precious bean😂💕
i have no idea what i just watched but it may be my favorite GMM video ever
Thanks for the wonderful class on the fine ethics of showering!
I didn’t know I needed this episode but I did😂 I love these two so much
no one:
   

 absolutely no soul:

Link: 
          
Omg its been a while since i tuned in since my last binge watch, NEW INTROOOO😍😊
Link: are you showering perfectly?
Me: am I showering at all?
Now that you’ve mentioned showering 

I NEED ”You Lotion Wrong” Please.
No one’s acknowledging it’s the 20th year anniversary of the first Spongebob Squarepants episode airing.
Link: There’s no happy ending

Rhett: sadly stares into the abyss

😂😂
Nobody, not a single soul,
Absolutely nobody,
No one on this planet:
Link:
Put the shampoopoo on the right,
Put the conditionerner on the left’
The poo poo on the right the ner ner on the left
I didn't know I was Link. This is me showering, a bit more lifting and exposing, but pretty much accurate
Thank you! Yesss! If it flops lift it.
This needs to be in the best of 2019 GMM moments.
 
Just love rhetts attitude here.

It's got a weird right club feel.
This is pure gold! I loved it! 😂
Awh! I love that link got this segment lol. He’s so cute
7 months? It's only taken me 2.
Link's engineer brain is showing
i belly laughed so many times during this episode. Rhett seemed like he was having an existential crisis LMAO
Rhett is my spirit animal. I can relate way too accurately.
This was an amazingly hilarious video. It is like Rhetts conspiracy videos but themed like something that fits Link.
I cried so much tears watching this episode

It was beautiful
Whoa whoa whoa you should definitely wash your face last Link!
And lower the water temperature before you rinse...
I LOVE this video! Please make this a series
Okay I actually liked this more than Rhett's conspiracy theory videos. This is gold hahaha
"Part 3, Dry Dry Dry." That's funny because 3 in German is drei. pronounced dry
::is starting to worry for Link's sanity::
"...you'll end up like a grown ass man on the ground getting his diaper changed."
Love the time lapse transition effect during links laundry load explanation.
You have never and will never make a better video. welcome to your peak, boys.
6:44 ok I'm uncomfortable now, thanks Link
Geez link is on his A game with this one
me: finished taking a bath 
me: takes my phone

youtube: you’re showering wrong
OMG LINK SAID A NONO WORD
Not releated to the episode but you guys should do Will It Mac and Cheese.

By the way Mac and Cheese with Sriracha sauce stirred in is amazing.
WOAH!! I bet you guys didn’t see this at 4:05
It’s much funnier when link does one of these
Rhett’s energy and will to live was slowly sapped as the episode went on lmao
Rhett: this is the day I start my life... because I quit
Cmon class! if it hides, EXPOSE IT! If it flops LIFT IT.
I boiled this frog for safety😄
"I am a sweet peach who knows his worth" 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Me:



GMM: you're showering wrong 

Me: just another good mythical morning
This is perhaps top 10 funniest episodes of all time material
Is Link Not Just Cyril From Archer?
I'm concerned link wasn't kidding this whole video....
OH HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED! 
I've always wanted a segment for Link to act like an insufferable perfectionist to balance Rhett's Rants, where he acts as an insufferable conspiracy theorist. I'll call this segment Link Laments (in my head). I love it! This is perfect.
Easily one of my favorite episodes in a while
Just randomly watched GMCL #20. Some things change, others stay the same!!! 😂
The wiki how style drawings had me 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Link used the great than sign in the presentation.
I got confused.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Link said "lying on the floor like a grown ass man getting his diaper changed"
This is so weird. I love it.. lol
Payback Rhett glorious payback.lol
😂😂Rhett's Facial expressions the whole time was the best made my day😂love talks videos
But Link, you forgot to stress how important it is to wash the bellybutton! 😂
7:42
*tisk*
what's goin on down there
This is the equivalent to Rhett’s conspiracy theory episodes. One gets all excited, the other has to sit their and take it.
these are definitely my favorite types of videos!!!😂😂
like the one about how redheads are aliens
Same Rhett same 
Reactions to links presentation
I think I have issues, I showered basically the same way Link described, including the pre-drying
I like how he literally just described how I take my showers! 😂👍🏻
From 6:48 till 7:01 Rhett's face was priceless 😂😂😂😂
I think somebody has been watching Bonding on Netflix a little  to much 😂
I laughed-cried so hard that during the episode, that I almost chocked!😹 
Link is on some sort of hallucinogens and Rhett is just hoping not to get demonetized...if it flops, lift it...😭😂🤣
Litteraly the most informative video this year, probably ever, i never knew i was showering wrong thank you for opening my eyes and changing my life xx
On the next episode: You can't even sleep right you nob
I like Link's version of the Conspiracy episodes better!
4:10 Had me dying GMM😂
5:35 Haha Jeez link your so mad in this video
"If it flops, lift it."

I NEED that on a t-shirt
Let this comment be my vote for more 'Link explains how to live' episodes and 'Rhett explains how to think'. Advice vs conspiracy
Link I do the same exact process....how did you know?
I need more of Link making things better. It'll be a good counter to whenever Rhett goes full-on conspiracy nut.
This is THE randomest GMM episode ever.  and that's saying a lot
All I know is that I have love for Linc Neal. :)
I love this feeling of watching GMM right before going to sleep.
These two have changed my life in so many ways!
The facial expressions Rhett makes crack me tf up everytime Link does something cringy 😂😂😂
The thing is: I'll take his advices seriously.
Every. Single. Last. Of. Them.
I tried this method and I'm a believer now
Link: I am proud of you 

**SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP**

Rhett: don’t slap my knee 

 link does not even try to stop***

 SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP***
no one:
me: looks up what 39 times 72 is
Rhett being that uncomfortable made my day 🤣
I do all of these things already this is amazing 😂😂
WHEN LINK STARTED SINGING THE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER SONG I LOST IT I ABSOLUTELY LOST IT
Psh I don't shimmy I swagger 😎😎😎
Link: if it flops, lift it 
Rhett: Oh God!
Rhett looks so uncomfortable for the whole video
Nice. I literally do all of this.
Put the shampoopoo on the right,
Put the conditionerner on the left’
The poo poo on the right the ner ner on the left 


Yea!
No one:
Link: DisCrIMiNaTioN
Link: gives Rhett a hair hat




"JOTARO?!?"
I LOVE THIS HAHAHAHA. I think I enjoyed this more than I should :P
I HAVE NO CLUE HOW LINK KEPT SO SERIOUS @ 3:41!!! 🤣😂
If it hides, expose it.
If it flops, lift it.




WRITE THIS DOWN, WRITE THIS DOWN!!!
This is beyond bizarre, even by your standards
Rhetts anatomically correct body diagram was absolutely brilliant. Reminiscent of the Statue of David by Michelangelo. Bravo.. Bravo.. Ya'll done outdids it.
“BUTT” 
That had me dying.😂
did link lose a bet?
This is links version of Rhett’s conspiracy episodes
9:43
Was that a Dumbo reference-
Just leaving a timestamp for my favorite part 
6:36
Graeb ma ankles and shake ma haed
-Charles Lincoln Neal 2019
Link never told us how to get back dressed 😦
The post addition of screams and drums is perfect :D
This is a classic link and Rhett interaction with each other . Love it haha
Oh my gosh this was hilarious! Link was SO into it and Rhett’s indifference was spot on. So funny!
That's exactly how I dry myself lmao. I always hated it because too much effort
Can't believe he didn't mention how he blow-dries himself with a hair dryer at the end....😁he mentions it a ton of times on ear biscuits 😂.... Also this segment was hilarious 👍
Realized when that guy shimmied by “naked” that gmm has went to the extreme of weirdness and craziness😂😂
.
Actually this was realized more at 4:11 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
My new favourite!! Link your just to funny! Maybe have more how to basic instruction videos. 🤗😍🤗
15 min of my life smh
The part where Link fervently patted Rhetts leg got me laughing real hard for some reason 😂
I literally have never seen Link so aggressive in any episode of GMM ever. 😂
Y'all should get Thor Bjornsson on the show😂
Legit just explained what I already do
“If it flops, LIFT IT.” Definitely hard to keep a straight face while watching this during class lmao 😂.
If it hides expose it 
If it flops lift it 

Lmaosksksksksksksksksksk
Rhett half-heartedly singing along with Link was one of my favorite things XD
6:35 Link... From the bottom of my heart.... Täck så mycket från min heart. Rett, remain in your "unknowingness" ~ A (mostly) Finn.
They're really working to get the Rhink shippers clicks lately.....good for them
Totally Silly!
This is absolutely amazing😂
Rhett's face of sheer disbelief is soooooo unbelievably epic lol
Best part of this video was.... WHEN IT WAS OVER!!!
I love that Link has his own version of a rant video like Rhett has the conspiracies. <3
This is now my favorite episode 🤣
link forgot to include the part where he kisses the wall
"lying on the floor like a grown-ass man getting his diaper changed". I lost it
This episode RULES!!! Hilarious!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂LOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!
"I am a sweet peach who knows his worth"
Link singlehandedly solved global warming by fact of squeegee at the end of your wrists
Instructions too confusing. Got links butt brush stuck in my ceiling fan
I'm worried about how proud Link is with the way he showers...
I like this type of skit from link! Good job! Please make more videos like this
Nice episode, as always, but honestly, Rehtt's facial reactions are priceless :) :) :)
Suomi mainittu!!! Torille!!!
Umm... I absolutely need to know where  Link bought that shirt. I need it NOW
Highly recommend watching at a playback speed of 1.5 to maximize enthusiasm
There is a better way to handle knives and I know how virtual reality
Oh my Link that was very aggressively  informative.
Link: then when i grab my ankles i shake my head.
Rhett: * shakes head in disappointment * 
😂😂😂😂
why was his laundry-squeegee-towel chart so convincing
It’s been interesting to see almost 14 minutes of a man that’s questioning how his life has come to this point 🤣
This episode was rightfully demonetized
Yeah, I air dry, so I don't use a towel.
Sorry but shampoo goes on the left because you use it first...
I love this. Plus, when they first asked "are you showering perfectly?" I immediately thought "Link does." I just knew. And Link, I have your back on all of this 100%
Why do I want to try this 😂
"If it flops... LIFT IT"
Yall need to do a debate o roma on this subject
"...I do, however, believe in Finland." 😂😂😂
This is hilarious. I was laughing so hard.😂
This was like one of those GMM funny moments montages, but just a regular episode
"Grab my ankles and shake my head."   I just got a mental image and I need it to go away.
Rhett being in a mood the whole time cracks me up XD
I need more of Link presenting the best way to do things please
6:43
12:46
The best parts 😂
Alright, who did link bribe into letting him do the show mostly alone? Haha. He took full control lmao.
I’m so happy I watched this.
they switched shirts again
Okay, but a GMM Butt and Face brush combo would be something I would buy.
5:36
First time I've heard link curse xD
I work in a early care facility and I did not want to know how they changed people. Thank you for that image. It will haunt me for life know. Thanks...
"I am a sweet peach who knows his worth."
When it Rhett's turn its going to be "you're pooping wrong"
I live for them being more comfortably open with cursing
Seeing Link in a button down shirt makes me feel some sort of way.  I'm not sure what that says about me.
All the combined conspiracy theories by Rhett rolled up into one by Link
I loved the fact that Rhett couldn't say anything because he made Link suffer through so many Conspiracy Theories and now it was his turn :)))))
I'm showering just fine, thank you kindly
This is my favorite Rhett and link video of all time
You can be a millionaire 😭 what kind of math
They switched shirts
I wasn't expecting to see this ever but I did 😂😂
Link: "Next I wash my face with a dedicated face brush." Hands Rhett a brush
Rhett proceeds to brush his face
Link: "Feels good doesn't it? That's my dedicated butt brush."
Rhett: Surprised Pikachu Face
Link said "like a grown ass man on the floor"why you blurr private part but not the cuss word
I'm crying, this is hilarious 😂😂😂
Link instantly became Roger from American dad
I did all of this before I watched this video😁😂
Link is like an actual teacher..
His novel will be "How to do things Correctly by Mr Link"
Ove been showing like this since birth🤣
Haven't watched this channel since Rhett went in a sewer 🤣
No I am not showering perfectly
😂 this is one of the best gmm episodes I've seen in a while
this may be the funniest gmm ep ever! Link should be allowed to do this more often.
I love you God damn videos rrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is hilariously perfect 🤣
Link... Are you okay?
Not you too Link 🤣
Finally Link puts Rhett through his own treatment of being weirdly passionate about random ass stuff.
"You may exit."




Please elaborate
Y'all be crazy and I love it.
Yesssss Link takes charge! So good
That hair makes me so fing uncomfortable
Why does Rhett look so done during this entire video? 😂
Who are these people that require Link to explain the inaccuracy of 4:57? lol Link cracks me the ** up :P
I'm alarmed at how close this is to my actual routine.
Right now Link is like my cousin I see like every weekend who's always got new things to tell me every weekend. Love this. 😂😂
Rhett shows genuine discomfort throughout this episode
If it hides, expose it 
If it flops, lift it
Link is a genius
Since you guys have such a big audience please do a vid related to or about climate change. I don’t how lol but ur the ones with the creative minds.
This is my new favorite episode
Link keeps try to explain his OCD
this was fantastic, did you guys get a new writer?
Rhett is half a episode from leaving 😭😭
Oh how the tables have turned!
I used a new towel every day but thats just me
Next Video will be "You're Breathing Wrong".....
Things Link is not allowed to do anymore:

-Write an episode by himself
Getting bleak creek on audible! Can’t wait
If it hides, EXPOSE IT!





If it flops, LIFT IT!!!
Yes! I knew there were more people who showered this way. Thanks Link!
it’s wednesday my mythical dudes 🔥
8:10  is my face at work most of the time lol
Link this was a good attempt, just keep at it and it'll be perfect
Easily the funniest episode in a year. Good job guys.
Link deserves a wake up slap.
Strangely I already use most of Link’s tips 😂
I am a sweet peach that knows his worth 😂😂😂
Did link just say grown ass man getting his diaper changed
words cannot describe how much i love this
Am currently showering.
Checks phone
"You're showering wrong"
This video is Rhett questioning all of his life choices that brought him to this point for 14 min.
Rhett not having it made me feel better about not having it in my day to day life lol .
No Link, you’re showering wrong 🤣🤣🧐
Finally Rhett knows how Link felt during all the Conspiracy videos. I love this segment and bring the conspiracy ones back!
I like how Rhett looks so uncomfortable the entire video and how Link is so excited about explaining how to correctly take showers lol
Who else has used this since they saw this vid like me
Imagine walking into a college class, and Link is the first thing you see.
Rhett being uncomfortable for 14:05 minutes
I love how Rhett said he doesn't believe  in loofas when several episodes earlier he talked about how he uses one and how they aren't only for women..... hmmmm 😏
Link no wonder you only have Rhett as a friend
I don't know what to say. I am speechless.
link you’re so pure i love you
"If it hides....*EXPOSE IT*!
If it flops....*LIFT IT*!"

He forgot "If it’s stuck together.....*SPREAD IT*!
"i grab my ankles and shake my head"
"oh God..."
this has gotten weird and uncomfortable. i approve.
LINK! Where's the lesson on drying with the hair dryer!? I'M SO DISAPPOINTED! I waited the whole video for that moment and was neglected! Otherwise it was pretty funny.
imo you should be washing your hands first.
Rhett's face during this is hilarious!
Funniest gmm episode in a while😂😂😂😂...link should have his own episode more often......IF IT HIDES, EXPOSE IT, IF IT FLOPS LIFT IT
Link: Are you showering perfectly 
Rheet: Let's talk about that
Me: Let's NOT talk about that
This is one of the best vids ever.
Link is so passionate about this topic, and Rhett is so uncomfortable this whole video hahaha
But dont forget if it hides expose it, if it flops lift it hahahaha
Finally a good episode! More of this pls
As an ear buiscuit listener, I am very dissapointed there is no blow drying stage.
This is one of the funniest videos honestly 😂
You tried Link but it just didn't move smoothly enough for a presentation
Haven't watched the video yet but I gatta say that's quite a bold statement.
Someone on the mythical crew is a fan of American werewolf in london ❤
We Finns believe in you, too, Link! ;)
im..
this has been..
this has been a religious experience.
This is not perfect! The perfect way to dry yourself is to go outside naked and sun dry.
"Turn it up to the hottest, so it gets hot faster". I don't think that's how it works Link.
Link is a national treasure.
"If it flops lift it" - Link Neal 2019
wat kind of CRACK was link on during this episodejejfkfkkf
Why are there so many dislikes? This is my new favorite GMM episode lol
If it flops lift it
Loved Rhett’s over enthusiastic rendition of the poo poo ner ner song!
You forgot the second lather and second rinse.
In this episode I learned that Link apparently uses a fresh towel biweekly?
Wow what a great pyramid scheme
This episode is now my favorite GMM of all time. Link's thoughts on showering are amazing.
Thumbs up if Chase should do one  like this and show some passive aggression towards his bosses as payback!🤣
“It may seem gross?” 🤣🤣
please have them react to youresoloud
Okay, everyone, stop what you're doing right now! 
 Go to 3:42 in the video, slow it all the way down, and watch Rhett's facial expression change.....It's hilarious and I'm dying.  I love you guys keep on being your mythical best!!  



You may now carry on.
Seem like Link had his coffee this mornin
Rhett's expressions on this episode gave me life.
Finally! Link has the satisfaction of hitting his presentation with a pointer like Rhett.😂
Funniest episode in a while 😂😂
Awesome episode 👍 Love the (questionable) science, the fact that it seems that this is the first Rhett is hearing about this matter and the (again, questionable) economics to back it up. GJ Link
"It's best not to ask any questions."
Link's conspiracy theory revenge🤣
6:48 Rhett, same:)
Rhett is just so done 😂 love these two.
I like how Rhett is doing the exact opposite of his t-shirt. 😂
Omg I’m speaking for grandmas too😂💀💀💀 9:33
Link: payback time morherfucker!
Rhett: oh God.
"im speaking for grandmas here too"..
Links bin waiting to do this forever
towels as their own loads... 52 loads a year... one towel a week...
I see your problem right here, you are doing a load of laundry with just a single towel. You are a monster
Nobody :
Link:
I really want to know how much time link put into this presentation. That and the inflection Rhett used at the beginning was everything.
I am so amazed at the squeegeeing with your hands instead of a towel.
At 1:06 it says a^2=b^2+c^2 and as a math major this really bugs me
I already 80-90% of these things already.
I love how alive Link gets when he's telling anybody who'll listen how to live their lives
That was Cyril from Archer
Rhett is so done with Link
Contender for best episode for the season.
5:35
Did link Just say that 😶😬😂
“If it hides, expose it. If it flops, lift it.”
I clicked ahead to 8:17 lol so awkward with no context lol
Noooooo nope. No no no. Shampoo goes on the left. Left to right, it's the way we read and the way we wash hair. 
Everything else was good though
I can’t wait for the edits! 😂
best one!!
Finally..

Conspiracy vs. Doing it better......
POINTER EDITION
I have never liked Link as much as I do in the episode XD and he gets his own pointer!!!
Questioning my life choices of watching an instructional video on hygiene. Are yall ok?
The feet 😂😂
Lmao why am I watching this it's like 1am
I like the floppy bits best.
If link does this in real life then I give up
link finishes his song with so much pizazz and joy
Rhett: Well they have labels
I liked this bc i felt bad for Rhett for sitting through this 😂😂
Seriously, you should let Link take over the show more often. 😂😂😂
Lmfao I feel for Rhett 😂😂
"Grab my ankles and shake my head"
why does link have such a chaotic energy in this episode
7:30 XD Love that Rhett knows all the song and sings it apathetically
Rhett: link you can decide tomorrows episode
Link: I've got you
Rhett: holding a hairball the next day
Link: if it hides expose it if it flops lift it 
Rhett: Never again
If It Hides Expose it if it flops lift it😂
rhett's face the whole episode. priceless lmao
Something tells me that this episode was totally Link's idea
2:09  i can see yoursoloud adding this into his edits  "rhett questions friendship*"
I have tested this theory for a week straight and I approve of this.
This is amazing 😂
I totally agree with the squeegee method, been doing it my whole life
i looooooved this episode hahaha
At this point, I'm wondering if I'm breathing correctly
omg this is such a throwback!!!!
Loved this new format 😃😃
Uhm...where is the part about blow drying your private parts??
I have watched every single episode for 5 years now
Honestly, I squeegee my body with my hands before using my towel. Glad to see someone else does, too.
This is what we get for, Damnyell, Finland and Tokyo.
This might be one of my favorite episodes of GMM! 😂😂😂
god I love these episodes xD
they could do with 4 staff members
When Link said "ass" My husband and I couldn't believe it🤣
Rhett is legit re-thinking his life decisions during this whole video. Lol I can't
Lmfao... retts face everytime link says lift it lmfao
Nobody:
Link: You’re showering wrong.
Rhett just couldn't wait for this episode to end.
So... "Poo poo on the right" merch?
You forgot one thing Link. To hang your towels open so it can dry even and not get moldy smelling 👍👍👍
My favorite part about this is that this is legit almost my exact showering process!
Rhett are you okay?  Do we need to send help?
Yes! I love how Rhett has his conspiracy theories and Link has his matriculate and extremely exact processes!

We need more of this!
Question for Rhett: How many times did you consider quitting during this video?
They had the idea for this episode while showering.
This episode is perfect
Wow this is the best ep I've seen in a while.
i love how rhett looks so uncomfortable
Loved Rhett saying: and he's not lying!!!! LOL
I admire these episodes. Link did a fantastic job. And last time, Rhett did a fantastic job.
I’ve always showered the “right way” then 😎
My boyfriend would be so excited to know someone else squeegees their body
One of the best one in a while.
🎶you'll be alright your, head will be blessed music🎶
YES! Can we make this a series? Rhett gets his conspiracy theories, and Link gets his streamlining stuff? PLEASE!
Link without glasses is weird
This is my favorite episode, and I've seen every one. Thank you Mythical Entertainment!!
You missed the part where I sing like a dying walrus
I do this every morning.
Honestly been doing that since I’ve been showering lol
This is almost as detailed and specific as showers on the curly girl method 😂
Link’s hilarious, but Rhett’s just like WTF? LOL!
I already do this except I only use a towel to dry myself
this episode is a whole meme
Loved this. Good for you Link.
We demand a practical demonstration. For science purposes of course.
I’m concerned for link. 😂😂
Loofahs are NASTY!! 🤢 Not to mention,  using a towel more than twice is just as nasty....mold 🤮
If Link actually does this he really is a NUT!!!
I love this!! This was the funniest GMM video I've seen in a while. Please make this a series..
IF IT HIDES, EXPOSE IT
IF IT FLOPS, LIFT IT
I love this!! This was the funniest GMM video I've seen in a while. Please make this a series..
Wtf was this episode lmao 😂😂
but what way am i supposed to stand; facing the faucet or put my back to it
I’m so glad Link gets his own Easel Time now
Hahahah. Friggin' Rhett, he's so "whatever" through the whole thing :P And the blurred picture XD Maaaan Link throwin' shade
I use my towel at least 25 times before washing it
This has to be one of their most amazing videos ever😂
We all have our passions but Link... Link has obsessions
There was so much detail they actually had to blur it 😂😂😂
That "hair hat" that Link made at the end for Rhett looks like it could be Richard and Damnyell's cousin LOL 😆
i thoroughly enjoyed this.
I just like how Rhett absolutely didn't want no part in this.
I love your show I try to watch every episode
Link is an absolute maniac!  I like this episode!!
Link has been awaiting this moment. The day he gets his revenge.
7:42 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is the best episode I've ever seen
Tell me why I really want to do this now. I loved this whole video. 😂
this is amazingly funny
Link I hate to tell you this but loofahs are impossible to dry and grow mold, so you will have to replace it every other month.
Rhett looks so worried the whole video. Lmfao. I love these guys!
you are titling your videos wrong, should be; You have been showering wrong your entire life!
Yes!!! You were starting to lose me after 5 or 6 years of watching with too many "taste tests". Good job, Link. I would love seeing more Mythical Moms.
Alright,  who let Link into the red bull?
6:56 
Rhett looks so disappointed😂
Did josh shave his stache?
I actually do most of these things
I love GMM, but I feel like they just lost a ton of their audience with this episode😂
Rhett was 100% over the whole episode 😂
Where's the Notification Squad at?
"lying on the floor like a grown ass man" woah they didn't bleep it
do more of this
I’m a sweet peach that’s knows his worth I love that
Also, with the hair, if you leave it outside, birds will use it for nesting material
Link, you ARE a sweet peach and don't you ever forget it!
Just think. Someone had to sit down and DRAW the naked diagram XD
I’m oddly confused and satisfied
Love Link so much!!!
this is the funnies gmm i have seen in YEARS i am CACKLING
Love Link having the spotlight like this for an ep!
Oh my god. 😂
This was a very uncomfortable recording for rhett
This episode is now one of favorite. Love your attention to all details love it love it
2:52 Rhetts Face. I'm cracking up.
The look on his face when link handed him the wet hair is the way I look at my bills in my bank account
Not gonna lie I started squeegeeing after Link talked about it in an episode a couple years ago and I've never looked back
I loves Rhetts face expressions through this entire video. lmao
Dying😂😂😂😂
The way Rhett looks right now, is the way Link looks during a Rhett cat or post apocalyptic rant. Just saying. 🤣
I already do this!!!
When he said he didn't believe in loofahs I felt that 😂 those things are filthy if not washed and we all know yall put it to the side and never wash it 🤮 
If you wash your butt with it don't re use it until washed 🙆‍♀️
I'm not sure why I watched this. I have no words or thoughts on the subject.
I will never get this time back
“I am a sweet peach that knows his worth.”
The real last step is to blowdry
"Poo poo on the right, ner ner on the left".. This is my newest ear worm song 😂
This episode is so good
Rhetts face throughout this entire video was hilarious
I'd love to see link do this with other things, it's hilarious
Why do I feel like this is a PSA for one of the crew
6:43 this man just saved my life
Love the shirt Rhett, Caring is Cool!
So. Rhett has conspiracy theorys and link has a how too gide.
Who else showers in the dark?
600$ for laundry in a year is actually surprising lol
So, like, anyone else already been doing some of these tips for years?? I've been using my attached squeegees for forever!
Great presentation Link! I learned something, I think...
Link got way too excited filming this episode. Lol.
Oh and I've squeegeed by body since I can remember. Link... you are the only other person that I know does that.
Does anyone else wipe the beads of water off there body as well?
12:08 How does 39 times 72 equal 1,000,000??
My parent didnt teach me a lot, and this was definitely not one of the things the taught me
If it flops, LiFt It!
Dude discrimination 😁
That hairball looks like the beginning stages of Damiel. Haha. Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
Sorry but I use 2in1





It works better than shampoo and conditioner on my hair
Surprisingly, everything Link suggests is everything I’m already doing. Hehe 😜
i must say, i do love watching crazy people explain something that makes sense to them
This was amazing
Lord help me 😂😂😂 Y'all know this is 100% how Link showers 🛁🛀🚿 I think the pointer should have been used more to get back at Rhett 😂😂 If someone is just watching for the first time. They truly won't get how funny this is 😂😂
Lmao Rhett with his lil rhett made me laugh so haaaaaaaard
I just <3 you guys. :3
The gestures at, "If it flops, lift it"...
I heard conditioning first can be good for oily hair
I loved this so much. Something tells me Link is well practiced in telling people they’re doing things the wrong way
you guys realize you have beavis and butthead hairdos right?
Rhett questioning his friends sanity for 14 mins straight
I lost it at the butt brush part lmao!
I can imagine link giving his family this lecture
As a 32 yo man, I’ve never laughed so much in a GMM. great job guys.  Also Rhett you were cracking me up with your looks towards link.  
Great chemistry. Love you guys
I miss the old wheel of mythicality with all the prompts :(
Anyone else thinking “what did I just watch?”
If it flops lifted it 😂😂😂
What just happened that last 15 minutes?
Now Rhett knows how Link feels 😂😂Loved this episode
I literally do all of that!!! And at 10:20 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THAT
This may be the best episode ever
I should not have watched this while sick, can’t breathe through the laughter!
something tells me they have a coworker who really stinks haha
I physically cringed when Link started singing his shampoo song 😂
39 times 72 equals 2808, Rhett was right that it was below than 3000.
Keep up this segment!
I laughed way harder than i should have..
For anyone wondering what the censor the guy walks across the screen with  at Stage 2 says, here ya go: 

"You don't want to end your session shimmying and freezing on the bath mat to fetch a towel"
I really loved this episode!
Link, please do more of these!!! I am interested in being the most efficient I can be!
Oh man, this was a doozy of an episode. Brutal....
The diagram of nakedness made me laugh so loudly and suddenly that my cat came from downstairs to see what was happening.
Rhett hears the crew start clapping quickly he says “Please stop”
Monday, May 13 - 8:43 pm:
I am going to try Link’s showering method tomorrow morning and I will see how much better it is than my average showering method
Laughed so hard. "If it flops lift it up" hahaha
Ive never seen Link so aggressive before in my life. I like it 😅
Shampoo totally goes on the left... use all of your products from left to right
how do you squeegee your back tho.
Link forgot part of his drying step-  the hairdryer!
This is why Link won’t survive in prison
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Link and rhett:YoUre ShOWering wROng
You... INSIST? YOU INSIST?!
Was this their original video idea for April Fools day? What did I just watch.. and why
This episode is hidden gold.
I think this is the most I’ve laugh at a GMM video! Just so ridiculous and amazing 😂
Poo poo on the right
Ner ner on the left
And your head will be blessed
Now it's stuck in your head
I'm so uncomfortable.....
Rhett iz considering other life choices 4:18
Real men use 2 in 1
Link needs to switch careers to a WikiHow writer
Best video. By far.
we need more of these how tos
When he used the pointer to brush Rhett’s hair 😂
jeez...  uh... mmk
This is just an insight on what it's like to be Link's kids.
I actually do the wiping myself down thing before using the towel
Great vid mates
Alright.   Hes lost it lol
10:38 "He's not lying" xD
Should've been called "14 Minutes of Rhett Being Abused" lol
Laughed the whole episode 👍
Butt Link, for those of us who have bacne it's best to wash the back last being after your rinse the conditioner. Just a tip. Other than that I'm doing it "the right way" 😂
Well now I know
The look on Rhett’s face made my day lol
0:59 Wait, I do that every day?
Are you telling me that you only do 52 loads of laundry a year?!?! My family does that in a week and we’re still behind, and have a mountain to fold... 😂😂
Rett is just so done with links insaneness😂
...guests please.
I still remember the story in which link came to the conclusion: the moment of nakedness must always be minimized
I do all this already.
Wait what if you only take bubble baths
I love Link taking 'point' on this episode, LOL. Rhett usually wears the pants, but now LINK HAS PANTS. REVOLT, TAKE THOSE PANTS.
You're alive wrong.
00:38 

You know there were about 7 other ways to do that... but you picked the Link way.
This is the greatest gmm of all time. Pensis blurred, link saying ass, and the poo pop song, with rhetts enthusiasm. I love it.
Or like me you can judge watch ur towel every few months
Link. I have glass that requires squeegeeing after water comes in contact because if left for god to dry, he leaves calcium clumpage. So, where in your program do you recommend squeegeeing without the vulnerability of becoming cold and the glass not becoming hydrated again?
Curious about what GMM is rated now lol
Next Episode: aRe yOu SleEpinG riGhT???
CARING YS COOL ?  I think whoever designed that T-shirt didn't think it through.
Rhett's dissapointed look the whole time is just amazing
Watching Rhett so uncomfortable for once is too funny!!!
3:37 - lol, that is when he notices
This show has become progressively more inappropriate and it’s great
What happened to the blow dryer part link?
animated link looks like cyril figgs from archer
This was such a strange episode but still funny
Link has the power of the easel, today. 😂😂😂
I was showering correctly!!!!
More link how to vids
Link said a no no word
I love the similar style to the conspiracy videos and this works well because we KNOW link actually really cares about routines. 
side note though, my long hair will soak any towel no matter how many times I wring it out or squeegee myself 😭
Who else is gonna try this
Retts Mind : "This is where my life ended"
I think Link's finally lost it lmao
IF IT HIDES, EXPOSE IT. IF IT FLOPS, LIFT IT. I NEED A SHIRT LIKE THIS I NEED THIS
Never knew I had squeegees at the end of my wrists
This is so cute 😆 I love GMM
4:15 the moment you realize your video has been demonitized
Rhett is so unenthusiastic




I love it
I can’t with this episode 😂😂😂
Is this mofo on drugs?
Where's the undercarriage hair drier action!!??
I already do the towel thing
Next up: You're breathing wrong
Finally link does one of these
you leave the conditioner in?
Link one question, what about shaving? Where does that come in?
There's a right way and a wrong way to wear a button up shirt and you BETTER BELIEVE LINK IS WEARING IT THE WRONG WAY
”I am the shower king/queen, I am a sweet peach who knows his/her worth, I LIKE ME!” gonna do it
Is this revenge for the anti- Finland video??
Lmao he got him ! Butt brush
If Link actually showers like that, well... that's something else. haha :)
Rhett looks traumatized
But link. Loofas are the perfect, moist environment for bacterias and germs to thrive
New episode idea for St. Patrick's day: Will it beer flavor
I wash my towel like every month
remake the unicorn rap
2:16 One of my pet peeves is hair in the drain....I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.
the diagrams were hilarous, yes more linki how
I think link has a special condition.
I have never laughed so hard at one of their videos like i did this one ! Great job!
Lol! Rhett scrubbed his face with Link’s butt brush!
I very often grab my ancles ankles and shake my head.
Link for better skin rinse in cool water.
Love the if it hides expose.
If it flops lift it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was so fantastic in so many ways 👏
Is that bad I do all this anyway 😂😂
This was great 😂
Theres not a better way to build legos
So... I'm not supposed to eat the soap?
Link is aging like fine wine
I need moreeeeeeeee
5:35 didn't they forget to bleep it?
Shampoo and conditioner song should be on the playlist for live shows
if it hides, expose it. If it flaps, lift it hahahahahahh
this is so funny i LIKE IT!
The first GMM episode was "Extremely OCD Morning Routine." 1,536 episodes later, Link finally gets to go into detail about his morning routine!
Must have the bands. Must have.🤩😍😱
Link : you don't have to be a grandma to have some major flopping up top. thx
wait
 how do you know how im showering
This is the most uncomfortable GMM video I've ever watched
$39 X 72yrs  = $2808 over the years of saving up
Link should’ve made a butt brush for Rhett with the hair collected from the drain.
There's always a better way
I do all of this already
Why does link look like Brendon Urie
My shampoo is always on the left and with that song I'm gonna be confused and use my conditioner on the right first
Okay so I'm reading the comments and I'm so confused, am I seriously the only one who actually found this helpful? Xd
“poo poo on the right ner ner on the left” -Link Neal 2019
Why didn't anyone on the crew catch that 30 gallons a year times $1.50/ gallon equals $45 not $39. Link if you are so obsessed with this you should know the maximum savings potential! I'm disappointed
You're not my dads!!!
"And when I'm grabbing my ankles, I shake my head" 

Link should never go to prison!
I like that you can tell that this was all links idea. Link had tge floor tge whole episode. I loved it
I no joke did this and I personally enjoyed it
Yes, yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes.



Yes.
You’ll end up like a grown-ass man getting his diaper changed
Rett is me when my friend tells me about her bf
if it flops, lift it
if it flops, lift it
If it flops lift it!!! Always remember !!
lets talk about how I just watched the first GMM episode and they use the same microphone...
Rhett can’t believe this is an episode about as much as myself. LOL
"Show me what happens with the parts that flop." Haha.. I know what Rhett was thinking. XD
Link reached maximal weirdness in this episode
Step 3: Don't use super soft towels, they don't soak up as much water as rough towels!!
I am a girl. At what point in time do I shave?
what a minute, did they really just let that slide?? 5:31
At this point I don't even know if I breathe correctly.
Your videos are getting sicker everyday.
...wait what if no hands or arms
Wait to wash your face at the end! No conditioner rinse on your face!
This channel is older than me by one month
Haha this episode was extra funny, just thought I'd let you know
This episode was a fail. Zzzzzz
If it hides, expose it. If it flops, lift it.
OMG If it flops lift it. ROLF
All these steps is what I do anyway
this made me laugh
Ayyyeee who else up early just to watch them ✨✨✨✨❤️❤️😭😭😭😭✨✨✨✨
was this one up years ago becaause I remember seeing it before
anyone remember when GMM was PG 😂
I always like conspiracy theory Rhett. Now I'm a fan of Instructional Link. Maybe I just like people using pointers and easels.
8:10 WHY AM I HOLLERING LOLOLOLOLOL
Y’all should have given link’s diagram a gigantic blur
this is 100% me
Lmao Rhett has gone through this convo so many times
can someone tell me where link got his butt brush from (I need one for my face and his one looks decent)
Rhett being confused for 14 minutes straight
As a fellow four eyes, or in nicer terms, glasses wearing person... link’s “DISCRIMINATION” was a mood.
I need to know where links shirt is from!!!
WTF was this episode?
I haven't laughed this hard at an episode in a while. Great episode, boys haha
I normally squeegee myself but now that link made it so weird I don’t think i want to anymore lol
Definitely need more episodes like this!!!
If I was Rhett I would have asked link how many cups of coffee  he had that morning
I’m so glad I saw this before I showered
If it hides, EXPOSE IT. If it flops, LIFT IT.
The guy who walks past looks like Kevin from spn (supernatural)
Rhett was just being passive aggressive the whole time
Finally some good f**king content
Damn, so many loads of laundry 🤔🤔 me and my boyfriend just wash and dry clothes every two weeks.. it doesn't even justify to have a washing machine
I had to pause just so i can make sure to like the video COZ THE EPISODE WAS AMAZING THANK YOU LINK.
where's the masturnation part...?
I was kinda want to know links hair routine
I'm watching this. I can't believe in sitting through this.
The GMM graphic department is FIRE!!!!!
I adored this, please do more of these in the future.
Some ppl need this lol
I watched this while showering
So utterly ridiculous!  Not nearly enough poking at Rhett with the pointer though lol this was Links opportunity for revenge!
Then Link blow-drys himself
Rhett's eyes through the entire presentation...
If it hides, expose it and if it flops, lift it lol
This explains the water shortage in the western US.
I was with Link until the 2nd "if it flops lift it" 🤣🤣🤣
this was a really good video
This was awesome!
That moment when gmm goes from a pg rating to 14 A how disappointing
Just don't forget to clean beneath the muflaps
"I'm a sweet peach who knows his worth." - Link Neal, 2019
im pretty sure the amount of uses for a towel has nothing to do with the amount of water going into them but sure. just imagine how much you'll save if you let yourself air dry
Happy to see all the positive comments on this one
What about the conditioner? Do I wash it or not? 😆
Was he aware that by saying "dry" on stage "3" he was just yelling "3" in german?? Lol
Now Link can get back at Rhett with a pointer of doom
No no no no no shampoo is on the left you read left to right and you use shampoo first there for it goes on the left
where can we get Rhetts t-shirt?
Lmao thank god my shampoo was already on the right
Anyone else showering while watching this
Next episode: You're Breathing Wrong




The entire episode is just them holding their breath for 10 minutes.
If it flops lift it 😂😂😂😂
I love your god damn videos
Missed the part were you use one end of the towel for your face and the rest of the towel for the body
Perfection
Link in the easel  looks like Cyril figgis from Archer!!!
Does anyone else wait for 1month or more before washing towels/sheets?😂
YouTube you have a whole lotta explaining to do.
Rhett you look like my dad and brother put together I'm 16 by the way
I’m kinda worried about Link...
that jawline tho
Not a good one. Damn
Did they swear before ?? Am I trippin ?
I now fully understand how this show works
I must be breathing wrong at this point
Anyone else try showering like this?
As a bald man all this info is wrong. since i don't use shampoo or conditioner.
They should of said.. if it hides exposes it.. if it flops lift it and if it dangles propose it.
Is it bad that I change my towel like every month..?
Can Link please do an instructional pilates video with Damyell & Richard bc OH BOI
I am equally as excited about proper showering techniques...
I felt like in this whole episode Rhett wished he could fire link.
Caring is cool but Rhett doesnt care
One of the weirdest eps yet
Rhett looking at Link at 6:50 is pretty much how I’m looking at him for this entire video. 😂
Damnyell's cousin at 13:25???
I wish I had friends that watched GMM with me lol
that's not a loofa that's a skreechie
What did Link eat today?😂
It's so great to see that link has a pointer more
i already preordered it
Rhett was SOOOOOO DONE!!!😂😂😂😂😂
So true about not being able to read the labels they should make it more prominent
yoursoloud is going to have a blast with this
Link's Revenge for Rhett's Conspiracy Theories 😂
“Of course I’m not lying”!
SOMEONE ELSE SQUEEGEES THEIR BODY TOO?!
I love your videos but wtf did I just watch
Oh yes daddies!
L I N K  Y O U  S A I D  A S S   A A A A A A
What about parts on the towel? am I the only one that has a specific space on the towel touches a specific body part?
I haven’t laughed that hard in a while and Rhett’s reactions are an integral part of it.
Anyone else amazed how Link showers are very alike to your own lol
I couldn't look at those diagrams, they were just too weird, but funny
Rhett in this video exemplifies me as a person
Rhett is disassociating so hard
Rhett said like 3 things this whole episode haha.
I prefer  baths
LOVED IT can't wait for more Better Ways!!
how has he put up with link for so many years? please never allow link to write an episode again.
10:19 👁👄👁
I swear to god if this is another orange eating joke
archer references
should i be ashamed at how similar this is to my current routine
Lmaoooooo......i cant breathe bro
I've been watching this show for about 5 years now. I've seen all the episodes and the chia Lincoln episodes. This is by far the most awkward and strange episode I have ever seen
Go Link!
You got the shampoo poo poo on the right
This is easily one of the funniest GMM episodes I’ve seen 😂😂
Link episodes are like Lisa episodes of the Simpsons.
OMG I do the squeegee move!!! Hahaha
Who tf pulls that much hair outa their drain?
Everyone go immediately to R&L’s IGTV. You won’t be disappointed.
SQUEEGEE YOU FOOLS
If it hides, expose it. If it flops, lift it.
So am I the only one that can't reuse that same towel?
If it hides, expose it. If it flops, lift it.
This is one of the funniest episodes I've seen in a while! I'm living for Link explaining things.
What I learned from this video is that link doesn’t moisturize lol
10:24 omg ahhahahhahahahahaha!!
this is where the rest of my life begins...
Link is such a freak.
You guys definitely put on one entertaining show 😂
hold up, are you not showering every day? if you double 3-4 uses of a towel, you only get like 1 week of use
Rhett has some serious bags under his eyes
Now I’m gonna call my hands my squeegees. “Hold my squeegee” “squeegee lotion” “squeegee towel”
Episode 627 of why tf this is in my recommended
I really enjoyed this one guys. Good job. Also..." ner ner" is now in  my permanent vocabulary!
If it flops, lift it
First everything
This is one of those times where I’m reminded that they both got engineering degrees lmao
I felt like Rhett in this video watching this
Show this in nursing schools for bedbath lessons
look at rhetts fac at 3:44
I’ve always been showering like this lol
Not even a good format when Rhett does it.
Filler episode?
I’m as uncomfortable as Rhett lol
Its 2808..
Link reminded me of my math teacher when he was singing cause she likes to " sings songs to help us to remember" and Rhett is the class
I Love Rhetts shirt
10:09ThE cUrDiSh SqEeGiEe!
Rhett looks like hes contemplating hiring a hitman. lol
Why do I feel like one of them lost a bet?
5:33 That always happened to me and it has been bothering me for years. Thanks for the tips
Rhett had this comin
What if want to shave when would that process happen
Wait... they recommend using a towel THREE TIMES before washing it... Nope. Nope. Nooope, wash every time, mildew can build on a towel in a low ventilated bathroom after one use... Ew.
TORILLE!
Pretty good. Just one caveat, you have to acclimate your body temp to the water before you wet your head. Otherwise you can cause a stroke :(.
When do to condition?
Using a towel for 2 weeks is gross under any circumstance.
Where can I buy that conditioner and shampoo song 
Spotify
iTunes
??????
I always thought i was the only one that used my 2 natural squeegees to dry haha
You guys should eat the fire Korean noodles
Who’s been watching since season 1?
Rhett looked like he was going to punch link several time in this one lol
You forgot the most important part: finishing with cold water.
This is appropriate as an ep
The book cover looks great, guys!! ^_^
Did someone loss a bet
Wait i thought everyone squeegeed their body?
European friends where you at!!!
................is Link okay?
Now this episode wasn't weird att all...
my shampoo is on the left
"Well, they have labels..."
WTH did I just watch?!
Link is dressed like Supreme Leader
Did... did I  see that hat at the Kentucky Derby?
Link reminds me of Garth from Wayne’s World
Rhett is just so done with Link.
This may have been the weirdest episode....
TMI Link
How many of you are using this technique now?
This reminds me of that one episode where you tested bathroom products
I like how linkbis very serious and don’t laugh when others are
I thought this was a family show, since when do they cuss?
I like how they’re treating it like an episode of “The Eric Andre Show”.
#ibelieveinshowermonsters
Could you not touch my knee.....
Cotton candy randy has to make an appearance soon to put link back in his place.
My soul was crushed when Rhett did the math for me at the end of Links flow chart... #feelsbadman #Millionaire
Rhett looks like he's having a bad time
I'm literally crying from laughing so hard! I love this!
Can I buy links song
9:07 why am I watching this lol
Links song sounded like something the wiggles would sing
This feels like a fever dream.
How does Rhett know that Link is, in fact, not lying about his showering habits?
does anyone else feel weird because link is the one who’s doing the presentation
Finland: moi moi
Shouldn’t you put your clothes back on before exiting?🤔
6:44 Rhett’s face says it all
i've always squeegeed my body when drying owo gonna be a millionaire soon
This is what happens when link is in charge
this is WHY  I watch GMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!
'Link's fancy guide to doing normal things'
I take COLD showers, don’t @ me!
I have a problem. I have a Rhett and Link addiction 😲
12:57-13:04 rhetts stare tho 😂
Link’s got serious issues
Rhett was on drugs
I'm talking for grandmas here to ahahah link cracks me up ❤️
I feel like the show if getting more and more inappropriate
link was so comfortable touching all that hair because he was having a great time swimming in it in “what am i swimming in” episode
I’m sending this to the smelly people in my life
Rhett: “Hey Link, I’ve had a rough couple of days, and I’m really beat. I just don’t have the energy to help write tomorrow’s episode.”

Link: “So you’re saying I can do whatever I want in the episode?”

Rhett: “....fine. Just don’t make me touch anything that’s been in contact with your butt.”

Link: “No promises.”

Rhett: “.......fine.”
I kinda like this kind of videos, link did a excellent job
Whats those face plastic thingies called? Can't find one
Rhett this episode is the embodiment of all the people who gave a dislike.
So good to finally see Link with a thing. It has seemed he was the only one without a 'thing' ... Though I guess wretching could be considered a thing
Love you guys keep up the amazing videos 😁
I'm suprised Rhett didn't make more jokes about the diagram. Lol
Rhett is so confused!
Lmao Rhett is so mad today
me watching this episode like 😐
Link: I do however, believe in Finland 
Rhett: Ohh well uh, you’re wrong about that 

 😂😂
Link showers so weird...
omg XD
I just... it’s 4am anddd... Just the close up of Rhett’s face as he noticed the brush says butt on it... I’ve never laughed so hard. I’ve gotta go to bed.
Rhett hated link today
This is just a Link conspiracy theory episode modified......and I LOVE It!!!!!
LINK STOP BULLYING RETT!!!!!!!
If you do it like Link,  you are doing it ridiculously wrong.
Monotonous humour.
What the eff did i just watch😂😂
Shampoo goes on first to clean the hair
Conditioner goes on and leaves the hair silky and smoooth.

STOP looking at me swan.
THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL THAT SAID THE GOOD MYTHICAL MORNING!!!!
It’s like everything now your doing it wrong like your breathing wrong or your blinking wrong drinking water wrong 😂
I'm going to your show in Indiana!
WHY WAS THIS MADE???????
I already use my hands to pre dry myself, saves getting the towel too damp :)
i thought i was the only one who did the squeegee thing lol
watching this in the bathroom, my laptop is wet
You two are so weird.
why is rhett so pissed in this whole episode
I L O V E this!! it made me laugh so uncomfortably much!
12:20 😂😂😂
Pretty dumb episode
The Link diagrams are just Cyril Figgis
another episode about showering, really?
Come to think of it, the more their kids grow they're getting dirtier and dirtier,😲
Rhett is incredibly unimpressed
I actually do the body squeegee method lol
At 5:34 link cusses right????
What did Rhett do to deserve that?
Men showers: Get wet, soap up, rinse
Women showers: Wet hair, shampoo, wash face, rinse hair, condition hair, shave, shave again, shave yet again, rinse hair once again, wash body, rinse
Woow Rhett is Sooo Energetic😂, Link probably drank a couple of red bulls before this.
😂😂😂
I feel Rhett has never been more disappointed in his entire life.
The best part is when i scrub the snake in the jungle
Please more Link Tutorials!!! This was great!!
Rhett seemed very confused and disturbed. Lol
11:56 this doesn't factor in inflation, debunked.
This episode was hilarious!! More of Link's "how to do stuff the right way" please!! xDD

Also, is your novel gonna be available in audiobook form? (and not audible original so storytel could get it)
This feels like an episode of GMM my brain would make up in a dream
Rhett like: why I'm even here and agreed to this?
Why do the drawings of Link all look like Cyril Figgus?
Rhett did it better
Link looks like a hunk today 😳🔥💦
Its weird i do this already well except gor turning ofc the water mid way through
well that was..... alrighty then
Now all we need is the Rhettsters' "You're eating cheese wrong"
Rhett. I am so so sorry.
I love how the whole time Rhett was so entertained... LOL
I swear, this show gets more and most disturbing with every episode
Isn't a hat made of hair a wig?
I could  finish this video.
You’re watching YouTube wrong
Please let Emily be in this episode!
I guess GMM turned 18 today!  hahaha
That was trippy
❤️
When Rhett realizes that there is no happy ending 3:35 😂
Anthony Jeselnik has stolen Rhett's look in his new Netflix special.
I was eating while watching this... 
then I saw the hair 🤮 🤢 🆘
Oh how the tables have turned, Rhett
Me watching this episode: ☺️....🙂.....😐.....🤨........😒.....🤦🏽‍♀️
I have seen more than I needed to and my health class doesn't make I better    xD xD
Am I the only one who does exactly everything he said??
Oh man would i love some details on that silicone body brush
Please do more episodes like this! And more of Rhett's conspiracy theories 😄
Rhett sounded like he was dying inside during the Shampoo and Conditioner Song. LOL
Gmm is what I need in the morning to function also side note Rhett was amazing on this video
Wow, I've never watched GMM in the morning before, it's amazing—
wAIT THERE GOES MY SCHOOL BUS AW SH—
Rhett is so done with Link in this video
This is so so funny! But Link, STOP USING A LOOFAH! Those things are so full of bacteria!
Rhett looks terrified.
That's how everyone around the world showers!
Watching this with my GMM mug! There’s nothing in it but I feel fancy af
I use a scrub daddy instead of a loofa.
2:33 lmao
Rhett’s shirt looks too small and it’s making me uncomfortable
link instructions are hilarious
Does anyone else watch this every morning when they wake up?
My routine is like 90% the same
I think the April 20th episode has carried over to this episode...lol
This is the most not family friendly gmm video I’ve seen
I think rhett lost a piece of himself in the making of this video XD
Definitely one of my favorite episodes!!!
I'm surprised Link didn't include his hairdryer technique
There was a time i thought this was a family/kids show. It could be but i was wrong lmao
There is no happy ending
Link is a maniac.
The. Best. Gmm. Episode. Ever
Rhett seems so fed up and sad :(
Shampoo on the left and conditioner on the left because you put shampoo first the conditioner second
I just showered for school and now I’m watching this...
Hey guys! I loved the video! Perfect! I was showering so wrong! :o
Gotta love when GMmore has more views than GMM st 7:00 on the dot. So many people that dont even care about the show so much as being "First"
Stayed up till 3am to watch gmm :)
7:14 fake, but I still love you guys
This was a weird episode...
Seàn: LAUGH
Link: DRY
9:58
What did you do at work today?
"oh not much i drew a picture of my boss naked and anatomically correct"
This show just keeps getting bettter
Suomi mainittu
I'm kinda worried that I already do most of this.
Is it weird or good that I already do literally all of this?
link knows best!
I cant believe ive been showering exactly right!!
if anyone else watches Athlean X, i thought this was one of his vids haha
I. Love. This.
We need more instructions from Link like this, this was such a great video!
Haha, did anyone else's Google Assistant pop up when Link shouted easel?
Demonitized lol
A lot of dislikes I see
Showering is extremely hard for me because I have OCD (Actual OCD not the dumb fake one, I am actually diagnosed by a psychiatrist)
Hilarious!
Nice. They uploaded right on my break!!! I love overnights, and GMM!!! 🔥
Link should be my business teacher
I love how confused Rhett was with Link the entire time, particularly around 6:45 😂
Damn I was showering wrong the entire time
🤣
This episode was link x10
Loved watching Rhetts face throughout this whole video🤣
sorry to say link that I find your showering technique BASIC.
i think rhetts reactions thru this entire video are the BEST part! lolol
Isn’t it common knowledge at this point that Link uses a hair dryer, not a towel, on his flappy place?
Was someone phone vibrating during this episode?
I think Link has ADHD 😂
5:35 Link said a no-no word
These are the kinds of videos i like
slow day at the office?
That board about drying your self and becoming a millionaire, well done link haha
I didn't know Link cussed?!
Link cursing is my kink.
is link ok?
I can tell that Link has been waiting for this moment...He finally got his own pointer! 😂
Really scraping the bottom of the barrel here
cold showers are better for ya tho
Laughed so hard when Link kept saying “DRY”  while making lines with his brush and Rhett just starring where he’s making the lines 😂 9:58
😂😂😂
Im early not because i know how to sleep right, but because i havent slept yet
Omg this is great 😂❤
This was really funny, well done!
This was such a good idea! 😂😂
showering in the evening > showering in the morning 
don't @ me
You should just get a drain weaver. XD
I wash my towel after every use, nothing will change that.
This is like links version of rhett's conspiracy theroys
Link iS AbsoLutely RIGHT!!!  THat's ExacTly how I take My showers!!  Perfect Episode!  DanG!!  Right On!
Where can we purchase these diagrams?
Thanks Link.
HE SAID A BAD WORD
This is by far the most cringeworthy vid that they’ve ever made
Why does Link look like Scott Lang
It is 100% shampoo on the left and conditioner on the right. Like reading a book, left to right.
This was super weird
we need more inspirational life hacks from link....like i laughed and learned so much from him. Love you guys and the crew!
Hello Random Person :D
I have watched a lot of GMM and this is the funniest one! Why?? Its so ridiculous and so detailed at the same time.
Now that I have confirmation that other people have dedicated loofah for certain things I feel better about myself
Tre'Semme makes a fantastic reverse shampoo and conditioner where you condition 1st then shampoo. I use it and my hair has never been softer
I already do everthing as described (except the song (which I may start))
At this point


I dont know what I'm doing right
rhett’s facial expressions during this whole episode are priceless lmao.
Idk what to say....I wash exactly like him. Except I don’t always squeegy lol
Does link just have periods where he drinks a butt load of caffeine and goes crazy for about 14 min 😂
I'm glad you take showering as seriously as I do
This is such a good video XD
Wait wait wait...what happened to the hair dryer on ya body thing?
i relate to rhett so much
7 months? 5 years XD
Rhett’s just done 😂
This video is so unnecessary.
This appeared in my recommendations after i took a bath oof

NOTIFICATION SQUAD WHERE YOU AT?!
A comment from my dad: I think we found the new video for health classes in public schools.
Notification squad! I love you guyssss 💕😂
I verified all that calculation and I came to one disturbing conclusion.This is the secret of life!
You got to love Rhett's enthusiasm in today's episode 😂
Yeah this would be a Link episode.
Good Mythical Morning Everyone! 😊❤
I can believe link showers like this
Rhett this entire friendship: Okay I wanted to go, but I got nowhere to leave.
Jordan looks a lot like Cotton Candy Randy.
You never see them in the same room together.
That must mean



They must've had a fight and are still on bad terms with each other.
I like this format. You guys should do more 2 truths and lie food editions.
Link: * barfs *
Rhett: * tries to run * ooof okay...I've got no where to go. But i wanted to leave 
😂😂😂
"Look at his face! He's so cute!"
I know Jordan, Link's irresistible!
Is it just me or is Jordan by far the funniest on GMM.
"So Matt, how long have you been a sober vegan?"
I don’t think R&L realize that Matt doesn’t have to lie because Josh DID create those dishes.
"Look at his face! He's so cute!"
tell us what you really think, RANDY
I hope Jordan never leaves, hes honestly my favorite mythical crew member. Random words of encouragement Jordan!
Link just questioning himself for an entire video



How did I get 1.5k likes?!
"I'm just touching it for fun."  -Jordan 2019
No one: 
Emily: "Some people put reindeer meat in it"
Rhett and Link:
I don’t think Link knows what “one question” means
Matt seems to be a  cross between Jeff Goldblum and Kramer from 'Seinfeld".
Conspiracy theory: cotton candy randy hates Link so much because Jordan loves Link even more
Rhett: You can't ask questions!
Link: i'M vErBalLy pRocEsSinG!
“There’s no questions this round link”
Link: has existential crisis
Also, in round 1, how on earth would they have been able to fit a PIZZA-BOX PIZZA under that cloche?!? 🤔🤔🤔🤭
I’d just like to say that I absolutely LOVE Emily, she cracks me up!
why is he being punished for lying, WHICH HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
jordan - look at him. he so cute!
randy - i cant wait for your funeral..

man this duality 😂😂😂
The way Emily looks at Link as she's saying 'Becuase love Link'.....
This is the only perk of getting up at 5:30am for work
Rhett: Cuz, of the balls

Jordan: Yeaaaaaah

Me: Oh gosh...
HAHAHAHAHAHA “Don’t neglect the balls” 

I love Jordan man
THE WAY HE PRONOUNCED PARMIGGIANO REGGIANO MADE ME QUESTION IF IT IS EVEN WORTH BEIN' ITALIAN AT THIS POINT AHAHAHA
Grandma did that ish she robbed that bank😂.
Jordan: 
everyone: HAHAHAHA
For The Pizza Round I Would've Laughed If One Of Them Said Pineapple Pizza
New game: Are they talking about a puppy or Link Neal?

First round: "Look at his face! He's so cute! He's so inquisitive!"
Wee need a parttt 2 !!
Jordan - literally does nothing 



Rhett: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Jordan gives me a Patton Oswalt vibe
The coffee and cheese dish Emily had on round 2, they literally just ate/drank on LTAT. Wierd that they already forgot it existed 😂
So how long have you been a sober vegan? 😂😂😂 I love Jordan, that’s my husband.
Kaffeost is originally from FINLAND! :-(
THE PIZZA BOX PIZZA IS THE PIZZA FOR YOU AND ME!!!
Lol Link's face when Emily was talking about haggis😂😂😂😂😂.
Yes Link, it is like a crystal. It's the lens of an eye.
link: why am I here?
me & jordan, in unison: BECAUSE YOURE ADORABLE
Here a video idea: leftover pizza taste test!
We've already seen pizza taste test but would it change if they're leftovers?
I’m Swedish and have never heard of or seen anyone ever drink coffee with cheese in it.
"Because lying goes against the Bible."
LOL! Very convincing, Jordon!
Shouldn't the one who guessed wrong have to eat it (every round) not the person who gets away with the lie?
"In Sweden they put cheese in their coffee!"
me: lol we don't do that
shows pic
me: wha-
11:39 killed me😂😂😂 that's a best friends moment right there
Legend has it that if you stare deep into Jordan's eyes, you will get a craving for cotton candy 🎅🍭
I'm from Sweden but I've "never" heard of the, kaffe ost
Emperor Hirohito was rumoured...

Link: HIROSSHHITOO
PLAY THIS AGAIN! Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
Why would they punish Matt in the 1st and 2nd rounds. This is not fair.
i´m a swede... never heard about ANYONE putting cheese in their coffee....
Why do I get Flula Borg vibes from Matt?
Josh, how did you make a bloody Mary pizza? Genius!
matt looks like the guy from smosh i forgot his name.
"Just look at his face, he's so cute!" ~Jordan 2019
As a coffee addicted swede, I've never heard of kaffe ost 🤔
Oh man, I remember Matt's excellent work at AJ+... And now he has this fun gig ^^
I live in Edinburgh and haggis sushi actually sounds good 😂
As a Swede. I've never heard about Kaffe-Ost. It sounds insane
That is a beautiful woman.
After Star Wars, you'd expect Adam Driver to be pretty busy, so it's nice that he helps the GMM crew out from time to time.
Is Link short-circuiting at 11:40? :D
I have lived 30 years in Sweden and never heard about cheese or meat in coffee lol.
Matt reminds me of a brunette Nigel Thornberry. Great episode y'all.
I like how Link is just confirming information to himself and Rhett thinks he's asking questions.
Correction : Coffe with cheese in it is actually from finland, not sweden. (From a swedish person)
I love GMM, it reduces my anxiety in the morning 😁👍 such awesomeness must be recognized
I'm from Sweden and I have never heard of kaffeost (coffecheese).
So I really thought that Emily was the one who was lying.
Link is right. Fish have a very calcified clear round lens. Its like a tiny mineral marble just as rigid and stiff as a glass one
Kaffe Ost is from FINLAND, not Sweden.
I live in Sweden, and cheese in coffe...is not a thing
Nobody:




Rhett: THIS IS NOT MY F*CKING CHAIR!
Matt saying "I dont want to" is the cutest thing I've heard all day.
You guys got the guy who wroked for FrannyFio?! You are so lucky! What a dream team!
Matt is quickly becoming a favorite of mine
I've lived in Sweden my whole life and I have never even heard of people putting cheese and meat in their coffee.. probably some local stuff way up north..
This format where they have the crew trying to convince them just doesn't work.
I'll watch anything with Emily in it. She's sooooooooo freakin gorgeous. That red hair, those chompers, and that husky voice...... Holy Moly, what a mega babe. MORE EMILY MORE EMILY MORE EMILY
Rhett said: you already asked how much it cost🤣
Jordan looks like that guy who punched his screen playing scary maze😂
I don't get why Matt had to eat the first 2. He successfully tricked Rhett and Link lol
Hey everyone cares that you are early
SO DEFINITELY GO AND SAY YOURE EARLY THIS IS NOT SARCASM
"Matt, how long have you been a sober vegan?"

Since right now
It wasn't candied wasps, it would've been wasp LARVAE, called "Hachinoko" in Japan
Amazing. Thank you R&L for your reactions at the end.
I am from sweden and i have NEVER EVER heard of kaffeost
Thanks for that Portal reference!
That was a triumph.
I'm Swedish and I've never heard of that supposed Swedish coffee thing Emily talked about... 😂😂😂
Who else was like wth is insex for like a striaght minute?
This coffee-ost they are talking about, came originaly from Finland. I know case im from sweden 😁
Matt is awesome!
The others too ofc, but Matt is a breath of fresh air.
I love you Cottoncandy Randy.
Rhett: You can ask all the questions you want.. to yourself!
Link: Why am I here? 


Lmao.
Im Swedish and I've NEVER heard of coffee with cheece. WTF!?😂
Roses are red
Apples are too
I got a like
But why is it blue.
What is everyone's dream GMM guests?
Mine are Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May from the grand tour
Each "tim-member" 😂 I love Rhett but like no hetero
"The sushi is a lie" -Link 2019
I peeped that portal reference Link it did not go unnoticed lol
11:14 When you mispronounce the name of an Emperor-deity
I really ought to go to bed, but Rhett and Link...
WE DO NOT PUT CHEESE IN OUR COFFEE
Rhett:You can't be asking questions!
Link: I'm just processing verbally.
Rhett:Well keep it inside man.
Silly Rhett he should know By now that is not the way Link works!!!
Jordan: "Look at his face! Hes so cute, so inquisitive" the budding bromance between Jordan and Link is everything 💕😂
"I'm just verbally processing!" 😄
This is the best way to start my morning ❤️
I'm getting very strong Gina Linetti vibes from Matt. Anyone else?
Im from sweden and se dont put Cheese in our coffe🧐
"Cause You’re A Default" 3:37 -3:38 😂
Love your vids I always watch them in the morning, keep it up
no one: 

Link: VERBALLY PROCESSING
A comment from you possibly oldest fan (my dad): we've been watching for a little over a year, and now I know the truth. Everyone is locked in the west ward of an insane asylum and they don't let them out.
I’m in LOVE with this new game!
I love this show but link asking multiple questions and not following the rules made me angry for a second.
"I think it's gonna be good"
"Whoa no...oh no it's worse than you could imagine"
I knew matt was lying on the second one because let's be honest if gmm is good at something it would be mixing stuff and an espresso and coffee beans mix would be a piece of cake for the crew
Matt is definitely my new favorite crew member!
Can you test out Goal Zero Yeti 3000
YETI TANK EXPANSION BATTERY 1200
it’s okay, link. I also verbally process lmao. even when i’m alone.😂
Lmao I loved this kind of episode
More with those 3. They're hilarious
I have Jordan's shirt
Can you try to make 3 DIYs in 10 minutes??
That last guy sounds exactly like Patton Oswalt....
It tastes pretty good

Yeah your face says it all😂😂😂
Today's been a nightmare so thanks for this. ❤
Y'all are the only reason I roll out of bed so early.
I thought it was Matt Jordan and Emily
From left to right respectively XD
Please do an MSG comparison test like sorted food just did!!
I'm always glad when the games mean real food  eating and not just points, dont know what that says about me lol.
since when does john c reilly work for rhett and link
go back to old intro!!!


egh
im from sweden so i know theres no such thing as kaffe ost
I love this show so much I wish you made a video every minute it makes me laugh so much 😂❤️
BBQ's in Manhattan is absolutely amazing!  Sticky wings for the win!!!
super early cause I haven’t slept 🤷🏽‍♀️ but this is a perk! gmm makes me happy ☺️
Rhett, good job keeping Link in check on the rules of the game. 😉
The one good thing about getting ready for school(and during standardized test day) thx Rhett and link!!
Yall need to try imos pizza from St Louis with a exclusive St Louis cheese the best in the nation
Who else refreshes their feed from  5:59 til 6 (or whatever time it is for you) to click that spicey video?!? GMM y'all, have a good day 💕
Rhett cracks up everytime Jordan talks!😂
im sad as I cant watch new videos in the morning  as im in England so all uploads get posted 5 hours late. BE PART OF MY MORNING ROUTINE. jk lol.
Jordan is literally hella funny, a perfect Mythical Crew Member!
When I saw the pizza box pizza, I started to cry. Thank you Jorden for making me want to move to Brooklyn LOL.
They should have called the Pizza- box Pizza "Pizza-ception."
Kaffe ost is from finland right? :thinking:
"So how long have you been a sober vegan?" Haha god i love Jordan, I wish I had his quick wit.
13:02 the way link snatched it from her 😭 yikes
the most engrossing gmm of the week probably
am i allowed to say matt could get it
Link..I love you! "It's like a crystal!" LOL
Am I the only one who misses there old intro?!?!
I live in Edinburgh and kinda figured the haggis sushi was real. I've had haggis burritos too.
I was born and raised in Sweden and I have never even heard of having cheese in coffee
It is awfully apparent that these humans have been raised in very controlled boxes
"I think it's gonna be good"
O H N O
This episode was so confusing
Y'all having them Benz ads 




Quality
Possible episode ideas: 1)Ranking worst America’s Got Talent acts ever 

2)Real or Photoshop Met Ball outfits
This is just a hazing video for Matt.
Clicks on gmm video gets Grindr ad 🤔🤔
Being from STL has paid off! We would use Provel cheese not Parmesan!
When Link bites into the sushi; Jordan: "that sucks"😂😂 that killed me lol
“Look at his face! He’s so cute!” 
Jordan being the voice of the mythical beasts 😆
oh god, fish eyeball sushi... WHY!?
I'm not THAT chewy!
Matt has a certain Steve Carell look.
I was literally thinking why am I here when link said it 😂😂
I was wrong. I thught you will got 16 million till Link birthday. I wasn't right. 🤦‍♀️
How long have you been a sober vegan??

Wow... killed me
"Thanks for LIEking, commenting, and subscribing"
Rhett I am disappointing in you.
He said “KoOlANarY”
I don't know if they're both single, but I ship Emily and Jordan, hard.
I want a pizza bouquet for my wedding. 😍
I thought the person who guessed it wrong had to eat it and if they guessed it right the liar had to eat it🤔
I just thought of the most italian think after the brooklyn Pizza was discussed. I shall make this grand pizza and It will be amazing.
Will It: Bed?
I acc love Rhett and link

Like it’s just so quirky

I feel like it’s the most childish but at the same time most sophisticated channel on YouTube
Link is me asking multiple questions in class, and still not understanding what's going on.
can you bring back the original mythical theme song...not the original of the remake your using now....the one prior with the cool Peter Framton Voice Synthasizer Box sound...that was a killer Theme song.
Actually the coffee cheese comes from Finland.. not sweden :/...
Edit: Well i mean we do it too, but people in finland does it more.
Gotta watch this before going to sleep. #nightowl
Oh my gosh I'm totally bedazzled by Link
Hi i love ur show it's amazing
They ask multiple questions about each thing!
I love this game for gmm, such a cool concept
Jordan is truly the king of my heart. I love him so much.
I am watching in the afternoon in India!
Rhett: WAIt THaTS IlLeGAl!
I need a youresoloud on links ability to not ask a question 😂
Matt looks like Kylo's Ren's good twin.
You guys are really amazing keep up with the great work, Is it me or does anyone else think that Jordan looks like Patton Oswalt AKA Spencer from the King of Queens
Ya'll had me rollin' this entire episode!
I'm not saying this to be hurtful. I'm not sure what exactly it is but, you can really seeing the aging on Rhett's face. You look very distinguished in this episode Rhett, embrace the aging Rhett and Link. 








EMBRACE IT!!
Emily is so pretty ❤️
This is a special fealing when i watch a new episode when its uploaded
Man I love the ambiguous jokes 😂😍
I'm from Wisconsin and I don't think I'm speaking for only me when I say that the pizza-mary is the pinnacle of human cuisine
Rhett: Cause of the balls
Jordan: Yea....😈
I like this intro, but nothing can beat the ole mythical beast flying.
Voted #1 duo on YouTube 3 years in a row on the Moon.... and I should know.
More of this is necessary. This was great.
When your an anime/Japan/kpop/ nerd and you cannot with the lie on the 3rd round
Jordan about to open the dish was one of my favorite moments! xD
Did you guys get the idea for political adds from Neebs Gaming? I heard them talk about that on their podcast.
Matt gives me young Bob Dylan vibes
Flashbacks of super mega roach sushi
why does Matt look like hes straight from the 90's
Curly hair Keith is my new favorite Try Guy. Thanks, Matt.
I feel like Emily and Jordan both represent the spirit of Gen-Z, even though they aren’t Gen-Z.
I work nightshift and everytime I come home there's a GMM upload and I gotta stay up for a bit longer to enjoy these videos.
There's always plenty of room in the cargo hold.
Good Mythical Lunchtime to everyone in Europe! I hope you have a great day ❤️
0:39  "Grandma Did That Ish" is the title for my new  Horror Surf album
I appreciate Emily pronounced Edinburgh right Americans usually don’t
Jordan to Link "Look at his face! He's so cute!" 
I love Jordan he's so cute
This had a very “Whose line” vibe to it. I love it.
The first guy literally said it had 17 blends of herbs and spices and they didnt realize that was a blatant lie...
I laughed to hard at " how long you been a soba vegan? " 😂
Just finished watching Rhett and Link on the Slow Mo Guys channel. If you haven't already seen it, go and watch it ASAP. It's hilarious.
Link: why am I here? (Living the dream. right?)
I really think the person who lost the guess of what was real should have had to eat the good each time.  
Not the person who successfully lied.
Are Emily and Jordan dating? They just seem like they would be a perfect couple
“ So matt how long have you been a sober vegan!” Jordan is underrated!
Link is one of those people you stay friends with throughout college, and then after college you never talk to them.
Thanks for such an amazing episode on my birthday!!!
being swedish, i'm guessing the swedish Kaffe med Ost is the lie.
...and somehow i was wrong
what the EFF, sweden?


i blame Norrland for being the weird origin of this.
Who else likes this video before it even started? Lol. That's how big of a mythical beast I am ;) love you guys!
WOAH RHETTS BEARD
Hi yes Matt is LITERALLY ROSS GELLER
Matt sound like Linguini from Ratatouille
84k in 4 hours you guys are great.
Don't think that slick Portal reference slipped past me Link. 🎂
randy: hates link
jordan: loves link
This episode was hilarious 😂
The last bit feel like eric Andre editing
This is basically the show would I lie to you
I love Jordan so much lmao
Fish eyes are actually really good salty juiciness exploding in your mouth. Just make sure you spit the cornea out after.
Link.... walked right into the trap
Haggis is amazing, not even a meme.
Just in time for lunch......perfect?
Oh man oh man.... So glad the fish eyeball sushi is fake but the RAMEN. THE RAMEN THO. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH.
You guys should do something with Dude Perfect
I knew the bloody Mary pizza was a lie because I'm from St. Louis and we are very food oriented, I would have heard about that if it were a thing.
im amazed there werent any crazy brazilian pizzas mentioned on the first round
That's going beyond don't ask don't tell..
Guys you need to do more of this format please!
Uh.  Yuk.  Poor Linkster.  I feel for ya.
Good Mythical morning Notification squadd✅🙏🏼
"It's in St.Luis. Periodt. "
Hiro Shito 
Repeat it, slowly.
If a superior being offered to answer just one question, Link would be the guy to ask if it can be about anything before the being disappears
I'm from Sweden, so I knew directly 😂
Why do they always tell them you what time it is shouldnt they know what to say
how am i from sweden and have never heard of this cheese coffee
love this episode and i need more immediately
Emily and Jordan got a vibe together. Give it a try guys if you haven't already. I pick it up every time I see them.
Has anyone else noted that Jordan resembles Patton Oswalt?
the new guy  is so adam driver
9:54 A cloudberry. 🤤
Your titles get clickbaityer every day
Haha as a person from St. Louis I was like Bloody Mary pizza I have never heard of that lol
I like this game. Props to the crewmember that pitched this
Link obviously doesn't watch their buddy Sean Evan's videos he had the pizza box pizza on his show lol
those food creations look pretty gross, except for the pizza box pizza 
and pizza flower bouquet.
Yes!! Kaffeost is the best! Gotta have the right type of special coffee cheese from north of Fnland/Sweden tho.
You should do ‚Will it peanut butter & jelly‘...
Jordan is amazing
LET LINK PROCESS HIS THOUGHTS
The lies were so obvious I'm screaming
"Why am I here?" :/
I already knew about the pizza box pizza.
I'm surprised Link didn't catch "timmember" at 1:22
He Said PERIODT!
He Said PERIODT! 2:33
You can put anything on sushi: avocado, orange slices, butt...
Nonono, Kaffeost is finnish, not Swedish. Big difference y'all!
i already knew the pizza box pizza was real, i've seen a story about it somewhere with pictures and all
Please tell me Jordan and Emily are banging already??. ❤❤❤
Is it just me or has Link's forehead gotten larger?
Aint nobody in sweden drinking coffee and cheese
Is it just me or does emily look like Gina from Brooklyn 99?
9:53 That is foto shoped i live in sweden so i now Sry for bad english
How did they get the first 2 wrong.... The man was stumbling on his words, his face was also in panic mode! Dammit I just spilled my cereal
i instantly knew the first guy was lying it looks like when you have to give a class and you dont study and just start saying random thins
I'm from St. Louis. Totally believed that the Bloody Mary Pizza existed.
I'm so dissapointedf Link ddin't ask if they also sold that ramen in Tokyo
we need matt in more shows
Referring to the thumbnail, it's Insect sushi.
That shirt makes Link look like he goes door to door handing out pamphlets about "the good word"
I will love and remember this channel when it’s gone
Matt: its a burrito 

Link: oh so it’s a burrito? 

🙄😂
When I first started watching GMM I thought it was just a side job for them and I thought Rhett was a lumberjack
Good mythical night from Australia🇦🇺
Jordan is balancing on that thin line of being intimidating and hcarming, i love him.
Needed more Canadian Jen 🇨🇦💪🏻
10:21 the sincere sadness makes me want to hug matt. Matt's awesome!
Jordan is my fav ever I love him. Emily was really swell in this vid
Matt is good liar! Knew it was him twice!
This was a good episode- too funny! Link, with sooooo many questions!
Link questioning himself is like me questioning my life decisions....
Emily is killing it! absolutely stunning!
Remake the Unicorn Rap
I knew Matt was lying he was too specific
well i was spoiled from instagram lmao
I'm from sweden, and I honestly had no idea about that "kaffe ost" thing :o I am so disapointed in my country now haha
Was the intro slower than usual?
This is a great game!!! Please keep playing it!
You had the chance to say, "They made all kinds of crazy stuff there in Tokyo".
There is a bloody marry pizza its sold in restaurants too..
Loaded this video up on my Xbox before I even got the notification on my phone lmao
I actually really like fish eyes 0___o
Rhett not letting link verbally process is killing me 😂 😂 😂
No one thinks Jordan is funnier than Emily 😂
i watched a 14 minute video of nothing
ok, uhm... i just wanna know when we in sweden started put cheese in coffe, i must have lived under a rock or something.. never heard about this :D
What happened to S12 intro???
Love u rent and link
Honestly waiting to see the new intro for next season
EARLY SQUAD!!!!!!!!!
Best part of my morning
Totally doesn't matter and I love you guys, just realized the liars effectively got punished for successfully deceiving the hosts. And that just feels wrong.
I LOVE how hard Rhett laughs at Jordan hahahahaha
I love Jordan so much. He’s honestly one of  the funniest ones on the show.
Sorry I'm late got caught in a Y.T David Lee Roth rabbit hole 😂
“Would I lie to you” finally we have an American version sort of. Keep it going like a will it sort of thing. What a brilliant premise for a show yeah?
do this game more often!!!!
I love Emily's laugh xD
I'm finally early to something!
I love pizza so i get tagged in weird pizza videos all the time on Facebook so i actually knew which one was fake as soon as I heard them all 😂
I love JORDAN!!!!!!
U guys never run out of ideas. 😂
"Look at his face! He's so cute! So inquisitive! I know Jordan, Link irresistible!
I like in Brooklyn. The pizza box is a real thing
As a Brit, i really struggled with everyone’s pronunciation of cloche
Burgundy is your color, Rhett. 👍
Matt kinda sounds like Adam driver
Haha im Swedish and i never heard of having cheese in our coffee 😂
I'm super early today 🙌. Rhett's hair and beard looking real good.
At the end I was right about it being Jordan
WE ARE DOING WHAT IN SWEDEN???
Ok I got no where to go but I wanted to leave. Me everyday at work and school
Emily is my favorite
Does this remind anyone else of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me on NPR?
I like Emily, love to see more of her
I’m swedish and have not rver heard of kaffeost. Except this finnish ”kahvijuusto”
can you put the mythical shoes on amazon?
This show needs more Jordan 😂
Can we get some Android love on the stickers?
You guys need to do a JK! Studios collab ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
“Heh heh heh heh, I get it... cuz of the ballssss.” — Rhett McLaughlin, 2019
Link asked two questions for round two
All nighters are good when I can end with GMM
I can confirm Link is so cute and inquisitive
Jordan and Emily abd the BEST!!
Could your question be is it real
early kind of.....
I know Link is supposed to "play dumb" as his character but.... it's pretty believable sometimes.
Oh my god lol "I got no where to go but I wanted to leave." Me when I drive to the gas station to see human life.
I thought he said "incest"
Link might be the lead singer of panic at the disco
Emily is so beautiful
Always a good day when the lovely Red is in an episode
It’s not in Sweden we drink coffee with cheese, it’s in Finland.
“How long have you been a sober vegan”  😂
11:56 I was drinking... and almost died! <3 Jordan
@1:23 - "Did he just say "timimber'?" - Link Lamont
Again, this is random and this randomness starts my day every day and makes my mornings wonderful
This was an awesome episode.  my cheeks hurt from smiling the entire time!   thanks guys and gals!
I got all of them correctly I think it’s because I’m a professional liar
Is it just me or does Matt remind anyone else of Adam Driver?
Why did Matt have to eat the stuff ...
Sorry but I live in sweden and i have NEVER heard of a ”Kaffe ost”
yikes who is the giant beast in the plaid shirt?
Cotton Candy Randy in the flesh!
Jordan needs his own show for Cotton Candy Randy
Rhett and Link's friendship in a nutshell "I don't have anywhere to go but I want to leave"
Already really hoping ya’ll didn’t actually eat eye sushi..
Never seen Emily on this show. Emily is hot 😍
These guys dont know pizzaria bate papo
Is Matt just Adam Driver?
Jiren:Owari da for link
I was laughing during the sushi part until he said about the eyeballs
They make me smile every morning 👍Rhett & Link
the first one was so obvious LMAO
That Sweden thing is done in Norway too
I already knew the first one, vinnies pizza makes it
Round 1: 
Should’ve added the glorious pizza cake
I love it how they told them "now you say 'you know what time it is'" as if they didn't already know xD
Jordan was so obviously the liar but Link always gets in his own head! Lol
was looking for gmm content, looked at the time😎
Matt looks like If Rhett and link fused together
I would believe anything Matt would say his voice just sounds truthful
Rhetts shirt fit and color looks so good on him
I’m so glad I got the first round correct
I definitely have a knack for picking out the liar!😂 Some of the real products are just insane though!😅🤣
That Dude Looks Like Nigel from The Wild Thornberrys lol
Emily's hair is always perfect
I knew the pizza pizza box was real cause iv seen it lol
The sushi is a lie. Is that a Portal reference?
Come on guys, do your research. "Kaffeost" or "leipäjuusto" is Finnish, not Swedish.
Deep dish in Brooklyn? Nah
“Why am I here?” ~Link 2019
“I have a problem” 💀
Oh this was a fun episode to watch! LOL
Haha woke up from a nap just to see this 😂😂
The first time i knew it, the second time i thought jordan was lying until they asked the other dude
Emily is crazy ex gf... Anyone else see it?
They need to have Matt in more videos. It was funny watching him eat the foods...
The Pizza Mary is actually served in a bar in Atlanta.....
I was sleeping but then I heard a dInG! I looked at the notification and it was this. I’m watching this now instead of sleeping!
Jordan’s a dead ringer for Patton Oswald
lol ITS LIKE A CRYYYSTAALL
they should taste the lie if they didn't guess!!!! and that guy should be rewarded for his great lie! where's the justice!?
As a Swede, I am offended by the notion that we'd put cheese in our coffee :D
Matt <3 <3 Love it when he's on screen. He's so funny 😂
Emily could easily have her own stand-up, just saying
This is basically Would I Lie To You but with food
To much blinking is a obvious sign of lying lol
Great episode. Needs more of this.
Title doesn't really match the game
The redhead Emily wow!
Jordan, Emily and Matt need their own spinoff show
You should do some weekly "panel shows" with the crew. Would be cool! So many cool people you got on your team.
this is a great episode and y’all should definitely do more of these
Woke up at 3:30 just to watch gmm as soon as it came out lol
I feel cool for knowing who was the liar right away. Bad liar too lmao
when is mythical pomade coming back in stock?
I love that girl still eating in the last clip because that would totally be me lol
I believe calling former japanese emperor HiroSHITo was cleaarly unintentional. However, I yikesed like never before.
here under 5 minutes!
Emily is SO BEAUTIFUL
13:50 Rhett sincerely trying to leave made my day lol
The pizza one was kinda obvious lol
Can't wait for link and Randy fanfiction XD
You know your up early when you get a GMM notification 😂💖
emily is so pretty, an absolute icon
Quite truly, it's bug's eye sushi
I'd love to have the margarita pizza 😫
I hope everyone who sees this has a great day!
I should be studying for my tax final in less than 2 hours but here I am instead (:
Do you have a problem?
😁 I have a problem.
Rhett thinks Jordan is the funniest person alive
Cotton candy randy looks a little under the weather.
How could they not see Matt was lying...the way he was adding random details, it was so clear to see
Im so glad you guys have Shia le bouf in the show now o_0 can't wait to see more content with him
Great personalities you have there!
They should've had the avolatte. 😂
Each "timmember"
Link's hair is nice today. He is incapable of keeping his mouth shut and Rhett's had enough of it. thank your for your amazing show.=Compliment sandwich.
You guys gotta bring Matt on more often!
I’m from St. Louis and I instantly knew it was a lie💀
Why's he always winking weirdly
Ew
Jordan: h-
Rhett: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
Its 2019 get a 1440p camera!
Hires New Employee
Turns out, "He's the liar!!!!!' 😃
Matt: ‘You’re going to need a bigger cloche.’
The on-screen crew you have been using are fantastic. Especially Emily!
His not wrong about the hard part in the fish eye, its very strange.
I just realized i have the same fire place in red
this is like when link couldn't cut a sandwich and talk at the same time. The man is hardwired for some things
IM JUST VERBALLY PROSSESING!!!!!
Where's the Notification Squad at?
whoever made these rules made them very confusing lol
love these crew members😊
Matt looks like Adam Driver in disguise
leave link alone, RHETT!
I think we need an international coffee taste test after this episode, possibly featuring egg coffee and elephant/weasle coffee.
Try Butterfingers & Nacho Cheese 2gether
It is killing Link that he can’t ask any questions 😂 poor Link
Its confirmed links grandma is a world class bank robber
Anyone else think Matt looks like a slightly off brand version of KassemG?
Emily gets incredibly more attractive each time she’s in a video.
Remember clown shark!?
Part 2 please, that's fun! :)
I love Emily! She is so cute.
Today we ask ourselves an important question...how old can interns really be?
Press this if you're over 8

⬇
Link eating crystals and puking into cloche hats ✌
I just love it when I get upset that GMM hasn’t uploaded cuz I didn’t get a notification then it just appears in my recommended 😂
I love how link always says:" and you say: you know what time it is." to his team-members like they've never watched the show.
I thought in the end non of them had anything
Good mythical morning! Let's make America great today
There should have been a cake round so y'all could say "THE CAKE IS A LIE" like in Portal.
ok she introduced "kaffe ost" (kaffeost?) as if it's a widespread thing in sweden but i have NEVER heard of it, i'm not doubting that it exists but i've certainly never come across it
Okey, I am from sweden and as far as I know we dont put cheese in our coffe...
This reminds me of Bluff the Listener from Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me.
I come here two minutes after the video is uploaded and I still can’t manage to get a comment that’ll be seen. At least I made first 50 views
一一對應⋯、?：
Fun fact! the coffe cheese in in fact from finland, and its actually really  tasty  :)
I need to know where they got those bar stools from!
As an Italian, I love how Americans always pronounce Italian words wrongly 😂
You guys don't have to keep doing this. There are other stakes you can play with. Just stop doing this please.
Sushi is so nasty already. Jeez.
This was a great episode!
Matt. Cool guy.
more of this please!!
Can I ship Emily and Jordan ?
Why do you guys keep doing this to yourselves?
Lol this was posted at like 6:00 a.m. ha time differences
Jordan looks like the love child of Cotton Candy Randy and Patton Oswalt
Jordan is slimming down. We see you, you look good man!
Just to clarify I’d did not Rob anyone
I am Swedish and I have never heard of Coffee Ost lol
I’ve never heard about cheese in coffe never ever
I knew the Haggis Sushi was real cause... Well I live in Edinburgh and its not bad...
Matt looks like his brother is Adam Driver
I love everyone in this episode 😊
There are bloody mary pizzas, just not the way he said it was made.
I would be that grandma to rob a bank
thanks to Kevin and bean show on KROQ I know the pizza box thing is real... my guess is the 2nd one is fake. the mysterious wedding nonsense
matt sorta looks like daniel radcliffe mixed with danny mcbride
Why does Matt remind me of Ross from Friends? Especially when he tries the burrito and goes "Oh noo!" lol
Actually Jordan, lieing is against God. And that is far more serious.
oh my! Emily! <3
The Mythical crew are amazing
Im from middle-sweden, i drink alot of coffe, and ive never heard of putting cheese in it.. Sounds wierd, gotta be the northern parts
i miss the old crew member in vids
Links outfit 🔥
I know this is off topic but does anyone else miss Mike?
are those capris?
You do realize this is turning into to the Food Network.
But a bloody mary pizza does exist.
If Matt beat you & Won, why did He have to eat instead of Rhett & Link??????
A buffalo pizza bloody Mary
THIS IS THE TRIO! TRIFORCE UNITE
Emily is the funniest in the crew
Dont ask me why im here. _x
Ellie’s hair looks so nice today!
I live in Sweden and I've never seen or heard of people having cheese in coffee?!
can somebody define sushi for me, pretty please
I hope this game gets played more!
I normally love Rhett but I wanted to punch him in the mouth for this whole video
Matt reminds me of Ross from Friends lol
please release the boiled for safety mug again
For me (and other Australians) it’s more Good Mythical Night cos I always get ready after my shower at night to tune in to you guys, I’ve got into a healthy routine and it soothes my souls. 

Love the whole team!!!
Jordan is freaking adorable..... He has a resting puppy face.
Does Emily have a lisp
Matt reminds me of a funny version of Nicholas from The Walking Dead
I want more episodes of this!!
No! Coffee cheese is Finnish not Swedish
.
You can't trust a man behind a Moustache...
I like sushi
13:36
I was listening to Ear Biscuits on a speaker, and Link said “Ok Google tell me a bed time story” and she started telling a story
Matt really reminds me of Adam Driver
Oh, hello there, Matt.
I'm in love with how much Emily's hair pops!
Hello again, Matt 😍
I knew what was not a real pizza. I saw the two others in GMM in previous chapters.
more pls!!!
That's what you get for lying, Mattt!
Hi one of your billboards were in my city
Vem fan har ost i kaffe, haha. Det är ju det man undviker när man doppar ostmackan. x)
Im from sweden and i necer heard of cheese in The Coffee
It’s Cotton Candy Randy out of character!!
Kinda wish Rhett and link were doing the eating
Josh can sometimes make the best sounding gross dishes and he'll be like, "just keep an open mind."
Matt reminds me of Adam Driver.
Not a fan of vids featuring the crew, not sure why
Bit dangerous talking about hiro hito luckily most people dont know who he is
Jordan is stepping up his hair game.  He could put timberlake to shame.
Is it just me, or has it been a while since Link has dry heaved when eating gross food?😂
Någon svensk här som hört talas om ost kaffet? Var ifrån kommer det i så fall?
Link only ask things.
I wish I had Rhett's Hairstyle.
Matt reminds me of Adam Driver
when I saw 'gross food' in the title I already knew this would be good
I didn't know Adam Driver's weird cousin was a mythical crew member.
We aint drinkin’ cheese coffee
Matt is so cute. He reminds me of Garrett watts
Grandma did that ish lol
Matt Watson and Ryan Magee and lil dale from supermega
i was literally googling bloody mary pizzas in another tab, they exist but they're not from saint louis
i'm swedish and never heard of 'kaffeost'. It sounds like a finnish dish i cant remeber the name of.
Cafeost 🖒🖒
We need more Jordan
Am I the only one who immediately went "That Bloody Mary Pizza does not exist!" when he was describing it?
Coz of the ballz yeaaaaaaaaa
They're all really good liars. Good thing I know how to read body language
“We gonna ask each timmember–“
Holy moly those two guys at the table make Rhett and Link look like Tom Ford models.
GMM is just great!!! 😂😂
7:50 thats a lie. Im swedish and that is a lie we dont put cheese is coffee
I guessed the lie right each time!
Jordan is the best
Jordan makes everything seem like a lie. He’s just so mischievous. I guessed him all 3 times.
(Would I Lie to You?)
I enjoyed this game
Rhett's lips in the thumbnail scared me
I love Emily 😭😂
3:25 the way he said "Parmigiano Reggiano" made me die. It's read like the actual first name Reggie, but instead of reading the long "e" at the end you read it as "yahno", "Reggyahno", and keep the soft double g as in Reggie!!!!
12:43 I didn’t see anything for a second
I miss the crews laugh
Best part of Australia is that this comes out at night not super early in the morning
Matt is v cute y'all
Link questioning himself for the entire video
Jordan and Emily are consistently entertaining.
Get cardi b on the show
I live in Brooklyn where is that place that is a pizza box pizza where is it
Poor Matt always getting caught in a lie.
More Pain. MOre PAin. MORe PAIn. MORE PAIN!!!!
I'm telling you, you guys need to open a restaurant of all the stuff you guys have created over all the seasons
I feel like this game was designed around the need to punish Matt for lying about something important...
Never heard of "kaffeost", just looked it up, aaand it's finnish. Technically I guess it's swedish..
Kaffeost is more of a finnish thing even if it is a old thing  people did in some parts of sweden as well! :) /Finn living in sweden
Please can you guys collaborate with dope or nope 😊😊
Jordan is the only one getting the right pronunciation of Italian words...
Hirohito not Hirohito link!
I love how they basically said that the pizza-mary story was kinda faulty, but they still chose others as their liars... xd It was kinda obvious the pizza-mary was false. Its basically a pizza with vodka at that point, and then you busted him on the 16 blends of herbs and spices. Still chose someone different. Mind blowing xD
We have the same drink from Sweden in Colombia, our version is usually with hot chocolate instead, but coffee works too
WILL IT SUSHI?!
U guys should get Shayne and Damien on for a duo or donto
Rhett missed a " that used to be my name in high school ", when Emily said hot meat!!!
Guys... I really like Matt! He's great!
i love how they both cuff their pants
I love this show
Link questioning himself for 14 minutes and 41 seconds straight
i could tell which was the lie just based on being able to tell what weird thing josh would have made
Would anyone else want to see Anthony Fantano on GMM in a music related game?
Wooot St. Louis!!
I actually like fish eyeballs am I weird
As a swede. I have never heard of anyone here having cheese in their coffee
Should i watch this while I’m having lunch?
Didnt even see a single gag - where's the determination?!
Emily is bae 😂😂😂
I love Jordan haha. Feel like he is almost the star of the show when he is there :).
Mat looks like Ibra
I like Emily and jordon
Lol Jordan called link cute
Cafe ost is fake im swedish i know
Come on guys u thought u could get drunk on pizza....
What? haha I am swedish and a chef, and I have never heard of It hahaha
link is adorable haha
Lived in Sweden all my life and i have NEVER heard of Cofee with Cheese in it .... where is this information taken from ?
17 herbs and spices? I thought it was obvious he was lying
Matt is a great addition to the crew
Matt looks like Adam Driver
I thought the Swedish one was a lie because i'm from sweden and there is no such thing but an American probably knows more than me about it
Linj's cheating...they shoudl mamek an epsode aroudn that..soemthign that makes him want to cheat, but we wil get punished for it.
I had a dream last night that Rhett and Link were doing a Live broadcast (not sure why since they don't do that lol) and during it Rhett gave my YouTube channel a shout out. I immediately woke up and was disappointed it was a dream.
I love this game!!
1:05 is that bbno$
Once a liar always a liar WOAH LINK I literally said that and said I would guess Matt and say that and yet...you said it.....
Who in the actual fudge puts cheese in their coffee?
Who else went to the Instagram of the wedding bouquet ?
I can tell you people that I have never EVER seen a coffee with cheese in it here in Sweden.
Rhett and link should do spicy ramen challenge, including maggi pedas giler and maggi pedas giler 2x, mammee ghost pepper ramen, samyang spicy ramen, etc
Love you guys thanks for doing all the gross things so we don't have to!
The pizza Mary was obviously fake, you could tell he was lying while explaining it and it's just entirely impractical.
We put cheese in coffee?
I'm Swedish and have never heard of "Kaffeost". Sounds disgusting.
It appears that it's actually a Finnish thing according to Wikipedia.
"Leipäjuusto (bread cheese) or juustoleipä, which is also known in the United States as Finnish squeaky cheese, is a fresh cheese traditionally made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved."
When link asked why and she said for love, on the second pizza one, for some reason the "that's amore" song popped in my head, lol
i love watching this show 😭😭😭
Im colombian and we eat cheese in our coffee but we use more of a sorta frying cheese
Bring back the old mythical hat! Please.
I lOVE FISH EYEBALLS
Kaffeost is finnish, get your facts right nt.
I am eating sushi while watching this
Matt is so handsome
Okay but also if y'all didn't guess the liar then y'all should've eaten the food; the liar was so convincing with their lie, they shouldn't have their bad food???
Haha I'm from Sweden and I laughed really hard when she said "coffeost". I've never heard of it and was really surprised when it wasn't a lie. Ost is cheese in English :)
Kaffe OST is a lie. We dont do that in sweden...
I'm Swedish and never have I ever heard, seen or tasted Coffee with cheese in it... :| Butter is quite common for fitness purposes.... But cheese? Nuh-uuh
I've come here to let everyone know that I love sushi too much to watch this video lol bye :)*
I really like matt lol he’s funny
Don't take a stab at St. Louis like that!
Sometimes, when I'm feeling extra naughty, I'll watch Gmmore before gmm 😎
Vem fan lägger ost i Kaffet?
Jordan and Emily sitting in a tree ~
When Link winks😋😋😋
Some trues tires are too strange to be a morning.
I'm trying to eat breakfast.
Sushi insects so bad!
Haggis sushi sounds pretty good.
i feel like jordan is Cotton Candy Randy
I really like Emily's hair
I want someone to look at me the way Rhett looks at Jordan
7:49
You lie, Emily! Sweden doesn't have Kaffeost! I've never heard of such a thing and I am a Swede!
- What?! It was not a lie?! How come I never heard of it??!!
...
Google: Kaffeost is a traditonal north FINNISH dish.
Me: Emelie, you LIED! It's not SWEDISH! xDDD It is Finnish. Though SOME Swedes in the north eats it. But. Still not a Swedish dish ;)
(I still found it funny though).
I love Emily.
Pizza Mary haha
Emily 😍🥰
They both wear their wedding rings how cute I’ve never noticed and they show their hands all the time
Very cool that Adam Driver excelled at this game.
Mark Zuckeberg on gmm
13:42 rhett going for the f word then remembering its a family show
Matt played 2 lies 1 truth all by himself
Pizza box pizza is just nasty think about all the surfaces and hands it touches 🤢
Aww they weren't on their game today. A pizza bouquet or a pizza box pizza couldn't have fit under the covers!
Shouldn't Jordan feel bad that his name was written for two rounds
haggis is great
I’m Swedish and I have never heard of a caffe ost
Jordan is my fave
Lmao the pizza place in the first round was my regular pizza spot when I was working in brooklyn, its really good pizza too
Eye sushi shouldn't be that weird since catfish eyes are great asnd sushi is great
i dont understand why matt had to eat the stuff when rhett and link both got it wrong
Is that Matt the radar technician???
Parmigiano reggiano, is just parmesan!  It comes from a specific region of Italy and is 'real parmesan'. Kind of like Chapagne vs. Sparkling wine
Matt is just Link and Rhett combined.
I got all of them right 🙌🙌🙌
So Kassem is doing this now..
Wow, I guess Cotton Candy Randy does like Link!
Does Emily remind anyone else of Emma stone? Not necessarily in looks but in voice and personality?! And funny enough Emma stones name is actually Emily too! Lol
the fat guy has a thing for linky poo
each timimber
Real parmasean is crazy expensive
5:02 is the cotton candy guy
Ok, the Bloody Mary pizza is a real thing a few restaurants around here in St. Louis have. (I haven't gotten to the point where they reveal if Matt actually had it).
I gaged when Emily said haggis sushi
I'M JUST TOUCHIN' IT. FOR FUN.
I think Rhett and Link should have had to eat whatever it is if they guess wrong.......
PLEASE KEEP MATT ON THE SHOW, HE IS HILARIOUS!
Angry Rhett is alive and well in this life. 😂
THE SUSHI IS A LIE
I hope they do this again sometime
It happen again watching this in the morning
as a swedish person im disguted and amazed that ive never heard about kaffe ost :| but after googling it google claims its originaly a northern finnish dish
I am wearing the same shirt Jordan is wearing today!  😂
It would be amazing to see an episode where you refer to much older episodes like where Rhett predicted "future fast food" 11 years ago and comment on them now!
Kaffe-ost?! Wtf I’ve never heard of that, I live in Stockholm
HEY!!! The rules at the beginning of the game state that if you win, you get to try the food. So technically Rhett should have eaten the last dish. THE RULES ARE A LIE!
Bloody Mary pizza is a real thing!!!
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 80: "Sometimes telling a little white lie can be a good thing... Say the cops are banging on your door asking if your grandma robbed those six banks, and you say I don't know officer, when you know dang well Grandma did that ish" - Rhett and Link
how did they know matt was the first liar! it was so obvious to me!
Kaffeost isn't Swedish, it's Finnish.. Duuuuh...
If the pizza box is a pizza and not contained within anything, how is that sanitary?
Cmn grandma did not do that ish haha
Am I the only one coming back after like three or four years for some nostalgia
Oh Link.....
HAPPY COTTON CANDY DAY DADDYS
Omg Emily is so hot
Hahahaha look at his face it's so cute, so inquisitive.
They copied "Would I lie to you?"
"Insex"
Ost I kaffet??? Va I helvete ??
Rhett at 5:37....... I’m uncomfortable 🙄
We do NOT drink coffee with cheese here in Sweden! hahaha totally a lie
Guessed them all!
11:24 Link looks so appetized
Jordan is my favorite person. His comedy is my favorite. He’s literally Cotton Candy Randy.
They pick literally the most believable ones
I'm a swede and I have never heard of "kaffe ost" (Coffe cheese). Any other swede here who can tell me where you drink this?
I’ve had cheese in my coffee- it was delicious!!
Someone explain the rein deer joke pls... 🙄
kaffe ost is in swedish so...
Sushi ❤
I’m Swedish and I have never heard of the cheese coffee
We love the mythical crew!!!!
Jordan is the best actor of all time. I swear the first game i had him down as lying because of how serious he's coming across. The man knows killer performance. Incredible.
Link leave the show your not funny
Wait a second. 
Rhett didn't do his signature move whenever someone says "Japan".
Mythical beasts where you at?
Pizza bouquet? Send that instead of fruit bouquets!
watching these games about food makes perfect when watching while eating mmmm
Anyone else think Jordan can play the old man in a live adaption of Up?
I’m getting sick of link
Matt is funnn
Bloody Mary Pizza. Combine tomato, horseradish, Worcestershire sauces and finely chopped green olives for a Bloody Mary-flavored sauce. Spread over a flatbread crust, then top with mozzarella cheese, Sriracha Sausage, crisp celery, and more green olives … its a real thing google it
i want that burrito sooooo bad
Im from sweden, we really LOVE our coffee but I just have to say that I have never heard of someone putting cheese in coffee. 😂😂😂🤨
Rhett is so bias about link this episode
emily please. just go on a date with me.
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL I SEE YOUR VIDEOS EVERYDAY 😂😂
Its clear from this that you can never trust Matt, he's to good at lying
I know you won't see this but please try and stop making haggis out to be some sort of abomination every episode you mention it in.

If you've actually tried haggis you would know it tastes absolutely fine.

Source: Born and bred Highlands.
I dont get why Matt had to eat his dishes
Matt kinda looks like he could be nick cages little brother.
Best yters ever
I haven't read the comments so I don't know if anyone has mentioned this but... Is it just me or is that new guy an amalgam of Rhett and Link?
More Emily please
rhett really needs to adopt the foodhelmet since it keeps sounding like he saying the crew members lift their clothes xd youtube might act on that
I was with link on that last one. I thought they were going to throw them for a loop.
Emily is such a treasure in this show, she makes me laugh. I love them all, but any video that has both her AND Jordan automatically makes my day better
Ok... Seriously wanted to puke at the ideal of that fish eye sushi... Blah!
I like Matt, he fits right in
oh, time to eat breakfast while watching GMM... I'm sure that's a great idea... /s
Is it just me or did anyone else get half way through the video and just realized that cotton candy Randy is up there
Matt is pretty fun
look it's candy randy
3 TRUTHES 0 LIES
Never heard coffee with Cheese in Sweden, that’s weird. Even I am a Swede
WE do not put cheese in our coffe in sweden. thats a finish dish not swedish.  so she was actaly lying
I suspected Jordan of lying the first two times- he was telling the truth and Matt was lying. Then I suspected Matt of lying the third round- Jordan was lying 😑
I had a dream last night that I gave Rhett a prostate exam. I’m not a doctor
Who the fick puts cheese in their coffee? - a confused Swede
WHY IS JORDAN SO ADORABLE ❤️🙈
Hilariously hilarious
Glad i don't like sushi whatsoever..
cotton candy randy
Was gonna get the stickers until I saw they weren’t free
Matt 😍
Boi on the right is DEFINITELY Cotton Candy Randy (or whoever plays him)
Why isn't jordan whispering sweet nothings...
Do part two
Why does link look so cute in this video
Actually there is a place in California that makes bloody marry pizzas
I guessed Matt was lying both times lol idk why I could just see it in his face and mannerisms
I was so sure the Swedish one was fake because I am Swedish and have never heard of it. Google says it's actually from Finland
Wait what? We don't put cheese in our coffee! 
- A swede
great content
Emily ❤
Emily is hot
earrrlluyyyyy
As a south swede I have never heard of kaffeost, that’s northern Sweden type of crap
It’s actually crazy how good this channell is, It’s because of videos like these that I don’t watch TV haha.
It was so obvious that Matt was lying how did they not get that lol
Jordan is so funny, but the way that Rhett loses his mind at every joke is even funnier than almost anything he’s ever said 😂
How about... WILL IT SUSHI!?
how did that pizza mary fit under the cloche?
hey rhett and link have you guys ever gotten sick from the will it shows or hurt yourself while filming?
That pizza one is so easy lol the pizza Mary was the only one that would have fit under their silver platter 😂😂
Is it just me or does anybody else feel like there should have been more then just 3 rounds??? lol ft
The caffine in 2 red bulls is like a can of coke worth of caffine.
Happy cotton candy day daddys
Rhett saying periodt issa wholeass mood
Cake. The first food that came to my mind. The cake is always a lie.
If they were wrong Rhett and Link should of had to eat it. That’s what I clicked for. Nice bait guys.
In my state there's something called pork and beans Ice cream, and it's actually really Good
Am i the only one who Google the dishes in btwn the video?😂
1:23 timmimber
Really liked this game. Hope you guys do it again.
Get you a man who laughs at your jokes like rhett does for Jordan's jokes.
Josh described the sushi as boba but they ate eyes before and they knew they are rock hard
Is it me or does Rhett look tired?
That laugh though
7:45 Link: Is that all you want to tell us?
Me: QUESTION
I don't like the new tall guy.
This is the coolest thing you've ever done.  This, and the episode where you had animals lick you.
have you guys seen the  paul rudd  dead or alive  music video recreation ? well i felt something was odd then i found what was bothering me.  HE LOOKS LIKE LINK
Lets get lie too. - only Rhett get the good sentences.
Helllooooo
I would totally eat the espresso burrito
Jordan is so funny lol
It's pretty dang american to call tapioca pearls boba, i feel jordan didnt think that one through.
Are they losing subscriber?
The Pizza Bouquet: EAT it, or YEET it.
Okay... Have I got this whole game wrong or do they actually believe that we put cheese in our coffee in Sweden? I have NEVER met or heard of anyone who does that.
2 lies one truth
I think they forgot what the punishment was for having it wrong.. the liar always gets it now?!
hits blunt will it sushi? 🍣 🍣 🍣 🍣
Good Mythical Morning - It's 4:06 AM here in California. What time is it for you?!?
The pizza box pizza is at a place in Williamsburg. Williamsburg, like deep dish pizza, is the most non-"Brooklyny"(Jordan) place/thing. At least the Brooklyn I grew up with.
i know for a fact that a bloody mary pizza exists it’s in oklahoma look it up
The pizza one was so obvious...to me at least.
“Are you gonna eat that
Lol you can see link dying inside when he doesn’t repeat the ingredients
Type hello then hit the middle button on top of the keyboard 20 times

Helloing has been an awesome time coming home today I forgot to get back home to get the kids home today I have to get home to do a car and get my hair back home
I have lived in Sweden for 4 years and Love coffee but why haven't I heard about that coffee? 🤔 How did I miss that?!
Oh it's not sushi, it's fish eyeballs
I'm lost lol
I don’t get how anyone thinks Jordan is actually funny.
Emily is way too hot!! Hubba Hubba!
Jordan is Cotton Candy Randy
We do not put cheese in coffee in Sweden. Some weirdos might dip their sandwich in coffee, but that's the closest cheese gets to coffee. Ps. I have however learned that there is a cheese that is flavoured with coffee. Still, not just cheese in coffee.
Matt looks like he would be in a Wes Anderson movie.
Good morning  :)
I'm from Sweden. Wtf is a Kaffe Ost ????
I KNEW THE BLOODY MARY PIZZA WAS FAKE
Was i the only one who can tell who was lying the whole time . I kinda though it was obvious
When parmaseano reggiano is just parmasean cheese... when no one knows they haven’t actually had parmasean cheese
At the time of me watching this it's good mythical night
BRING BACK SONG BISCUITS
What Link doesn't like Sushi? Who would've thought
3:13 is that cotton candy randy?
Vem har någonsin smakat denna kaffe ost? Aldrig hört talas om det,
im early and I should be going to scHoOl
they only hire hipsters.
I'm Swedish, and we do NOT put cheese in our coffee. that's just nasty.
Awesome
bloody mary pizza is a thing google it
I'm from Sweden and was 100% sure that kaffeost was a lie
Oddly enough the one gross thing I can eat is fish eyeballs (not from massive fish); everything else would have been horrifying
I cheated because I saw the ramen with the salami, ice cream, and they didn't mention it also has bananas, in a ramen tour video this week.
I'm so confused I live near St Louis and I swear I've seen bloody mary pizza?? not like that abomination of course and not alcoholic but I swear there's at least one pizza place near me that sells "bloody mary pizza"
Cotton candy randy?
cheese
Every week
I like this game
So gay
The coffee with cheese in it and reindeer meat on the side is a lie too, I’m Swedish and have lived here my whole life, never ever seen or heard about that nonsense!
I thought the hipster fad had passed
Do a ‘’Will It Bagel”
We most definitely do not put cheese in our coffee in Sweden. Ost is however Swedish for cheese.
💖💖💖💖
Ironman dies
NO!  The cake is a lie.
What's an "erb"?
It IS a crystal Marine biologist here, you guys should really remove the lenses from the eyes before you use them in food challenges, since the lens itself is very hard and glass-like. You could chip a tooth or something.
hmm a pizza has cheese in it
If you’re reading this have a good day :)
That girl has big ole ears lol
Emily looks like she's not real but is very pretty
Love is pizza
The swedish drink, i had never heard of. Must be far up in the country , they can get Pretty weird.
Lmao don’t neglect the balls what an animal
Feces
Emily's mannerisms are super cute
vad fan är kaffeost
Any one who's eaten fish eyeballs (fellow asians anyone?) would've known that fish eyeballs are nothing like boba texturally lol Jordan was definitely lying then
I like Rhett 2
Emily's answer about reindeer meat could actually be true because reindeer actually exist in Northern Norway and in some countries over there
The whole first round wasn't gross, I mean how can you go wrong with pizza?
Hello
They could have done The cake is a lie joke
Does anyone else think Emily kinda looks like, talks like, and acts like Emma Stone?
Hi
Hi
My only reason for waking up now besides feeding the dogs
So heres the thing with that last round. Just guess the thing you want to eat the least... If its right you dont have to eat it and if it's wrong you dont have to eat it....
Yesterday’s episode was a disappointment
link your hair is greyer than my mums
I am swedish and putting cheese in coffee is something I've neeeever even heard of so not sure about that information, none of my friends or family have heard of it either :) It is actually a thing in Finland tho so please stop with the bs gmm, you used to be good
I love Matt
the guesser who guessed wrong should be the one to eat the lie dish.
Why does Cotton Candy Randy look so weird here?
I love Matt!!!!
The Kaffe ost  is actually a thing in northern Finland and in the boarder region called Tornedalen
I got all of them right based on how this show works and also how impractical the made up dishes would be. Idk if I’m weirdly good at this or they’re weirdly bad at it
Lemme just make the correction that they eat kaffeost in northern Sweden only. But it is actually from Finland. Personally I've only heard of it from Americans actually, probably because it pretty much doesn't exist anywhere South of northern Sweden
I thought the girl in the middle was pioneer woman for a second but it'd be a great episode if you guys have a food network star taste some food experiments
The Bloody Mary pizza wouldn’t work because they said it makes you drunk, but it’s cooked into the pizza, which takes out the alcohol in it leaving just the taste.
Daddy was a cater waiter didn't know what to do so he put his little girl in the industry too
:'3
❤️❤️❤️
The rules of this make no sense. Why did the liar who got away with it have to eat?
crew episodes 👎
Hiroshito... Link, as always.
I got all three liars right, can I get some sort of cookie?
Hiroshito....
It's the cake, the cake is a lie
In Puerto Rico we put Edam cheese, we call it “queso de bola” which translates “ball cheese”, inside hot chocolate. It melts inside of the hot chocolate and we basically drink the kinda savory hot chocolate and eat the melted cheese at the end. It’s delicious!!!
Do watching Good Mythical Morning at evening, illegal?
Hey hey hey why aren't they eating the things from the first two rounds? I need better descriptions of what they taste like. No one describes food as well as Rhett and Link.
This channel is dying, why even make videos anymore
HIII
I am watching this in sweden and there is no such thing as kaffe ost here but what we do have is surströming
HI Emily
“Keep it inside man, keep it inside”

Rhett to link 2019
HOW IN THE WORLD DID THEY GET THE FIRST ONE WRONG CAN THEY NOT READ BODY LANGUAGE
Who are the 400 people disliking GMM every single day?
Cheese and coffee is not a common thing in sweden. And to be fair, america has cheese and tea. Gotta dare to try new shit after all
So when's the divorce announcement coming?
They should bring the Mythical Shoe back for like a month mine are worn out
Wow
KAFFE OST
Are you guys using a new camera? Seems to be a lot clearer.
Nobody in sweden puts cheese in coffee. We do make a cheese with coffee in it though. So Emily is lying after all!
Some shows are getting really boring like this one. More food crap
Last night I had a dream I was watching GMM just Rhett was in Link's seat vice versa. i was like NO THIS ISN'T RIGHT
Don’t you think they would’ve known by now to say “you know what time it is”
Turned this on while getting some breakfast, half paying attention, I got 54 seconds in and said to myself, how did we get here?
I’m Swedish, ”coffey ost” is not a real thing
你丫的不能加简体字幕🐴
typically i eat breakfast while watching GMM, not today.
I would eat real actual food
Good mythical morning to you aswell
Rhett and Link should have eaten the item when they failed to guess the liar. the liar succeeded in fooling them and therefore shouldn't have had to eat the spoils. Bad form sir's!
Tf is this new stuff they keep trying ... Just keep making videos like your old ones
Guess what. I don't watch these with gross food. It's not good.
kaffeost is finnish
If it’s from Japan, it’s real
I wanted to see the pizza box pizza
Idk if this is kinda ironic but every night since I was 7 (I’m 13) I’ve watched the newest video before I go to bed. I’m seriously a super fan of you guys and ngl when you guys started saying “ mail day” instead of “thursday” on mail day it hurt
Can some awnser a simple question? Is Matt new? I dont believe I've seen him infront of the camera before.
so...this is borrow from the British show called: Would I lie to you. Major difference, those are comedians, not interns.
cool NO JOSH :)
In Sweden we also put cheese in hot chocolate. It's amazing to have some molten cheese at the bottom of your cup infused with the flavour of what you were drinking. And a note, this is not some american cheddar or anything. It's often quite mild cheese that you would put on your sandwich.
Are you guys going to provenonce and for all that Red Vines are the superior licorice? Twirlers are for children
Why does the lie has to eat it?
I am not able to mentally watch this so I’m saving it
Is it just me, or was it super easy to tell Matt was lying the first round? He just gave wayyyy too many details and I was surprised no one guessed it was him
Did Link seriously think that sushi with bugs in it was the made up/fake dish? If anything that was the one I knew was real. I just struggled to find it if Emily was lying or if it was Jordan lying lol. I thought it was Emily who was lying and I that I was 110% correct on my assumption;... however, I was wrong... but not as wrong as Link was lol and that should count for something haha
Ew stop bringing the crew in
Kaffeost is finnish tho
Does anyone else read who the comments at the very beginning of the video and not understand any references but then watch the episode and think "so that's why they commented that"
hi 650
Dont blame Emily for your bad guess! Lol she is an angel trying her best in a world of fun idiots.
Coffe with chesse dosen't exist
Kaffeost?!
Okey that’s gross do you know why because a eye, a delicious eye. can’t be eaten in sushi.
I don’t know why Rhett and Link didn’t eat the food every time they didn’t guess the liar right. If the liar tricked them they should have to eat the food and if the liar doesn’t trick them THEN the liar should have to eat the food. This was an ass-backwards game
bruh... but Emily tho
Yay
I love Emily’s reactions to Jordan. My favorite episodes are these game ones with them!
Im on to you two.😐😐😐😶😤
it is funny how jordan likes link but cotton candy randy does not like link. haha
i dont care about what happens on anti-social media so why post it just there why not on your website and or youtube?
Please read more..






You know what? You are the most amazing and talented person I have ever seen!🧡 Wish you the best from an artist youtuber!💚💙💜👍💖
That girls laugh is so irritating...
It seems like tasting the food should be a punishment for getting it wrong. There’s no motivation for them to get it right
why does the person trying to pass off the lie have to eat the food when Rett and Link get it wrong?
Why in the world would they make Matt eat it when rhett and link are the ones that got it wrong?
Nasty, any which way you want to go..... Gross.....
Just got my good mythical society shirt to bad the weather is shit so very little sunlight
Wait so the liar has to eat the dish for lying too well? What? What’s the point of this whole thing then?
Where is chase?
link is a clown
Ew gross foods.
Your show is getting worse and worse.
Eye sushi is Gross.............................
I expected better of Rhett! I thought it was obvious Matt was lying! "17 blends of herbs and spices" and "caffeine of 2 red bulls" were dead giveaways! Not to mention tone and body language.
I’m in the Early Squad today!
💖Link is Husband Material💖
I'm comment #203 pretty sweet
Hi GMM!
Hope this comment gets to you.
My 3 favorite mythical crew members!!!
Insert [the cake is a lie] joke here.
Ugh I love you pair
Poor link is always losing challenges lol
Early
Love it
The Bloody Mary pizza is real cuz I've gotten frozen versions before!
It's not anything like that, but it's a purely tomato based pizza
LOL SO GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
See I’m with Rhett here; I’d just guess whatever sounded grossest to me, because I would be okay with eating the other two sushi’s but NOT that one. Safe guess
You know how people watch the news or cartoons in the morning as their morning shows? well mine is literally GMM(Good mythical morning) & GMM(Good mythical more)
🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕🤘😎
Kaffeost is yummy.
Why were they not tasting it if they didn't guess right?
it’s so weird to see people disgusted by fish eyeballs bc as kids me and my brother use to fight over who would get to eat them after my dad fried the fish
Emily & Jordan are so cute together 

Don’t @ me
oh no．．

they're．．

 ｅｖｏｌｖｉｎｇ．
its a good sign when im up late enough to see the GMM for the next day :) its 3:19 here, hi from san francisco!
I’m physically unable to snort.
Kassem G has been in a good paddock.
My butt played a game of 2 truths an 1 lie an I lost
So Link is wearing women's capri's now?
Do this again!!! It was fun
I recently just ate but I always have to eat while watching 😂 not even hungry
The sushi is a lie, just like that cake all those years ago.
Good mythical 8pm from Australia
Wazaaaaaaap
Boring
Wtf I am Swedish and that cheese coffee thing is fake to the max
Meow
The one bad thing about these videos:




They make me hungry.
This was a great game. I hope we'll see more of it going forward.
The guy in plaid looks like a combo of Rhett and link
Ew..ew..ew
"don't neglect the balls." Jordan slipping in gold left and right every time he's on.
Emily!!! 😍
Just to be clear, Swedes do not put Cheese in the coffee.
Notification gang where you at?
I watch before work. I hate work.
Notifications didnt go out?
I’m always late :’).
Love these guys
Never neglect the balls.

Hi ;)
COOL
Yay
Im a lie
Dear People at GMM,
Can you do a shuffleboard/dartboard crossover?

Like if you want to see this and reply what could the video be about
Today is my birthday 🎂 this episode is the perfect gift
Jordan is the friend I never knew I wanted.
5:37 Rhett gave us that “was I the only one that heard that” face 🤣
If you look into their eyes you can tell which one was lying :)
They would shift their eyes to the corner for a second when they're telling a false statement.
Emily is oddly beautiful
Dang Emily is so cute
Emily is so gorgeous
Yay! EMILY!
No Sleep Gang wya !
Bug sushi? Eye sushi? Too easy.

Ps. Where is my notification squad at!

Liked for Emily, she's the best xD

I'm from Costa Rica, I wake up every day at 4 a.m just to watch my daily gmm episode lol
I waited eagerly for 3 minutes until it hit 7:30PM and this vid came out to eat dinner and watch y'all.
I love how stupid people are there was 8 dislikes and 6 views 😂
I want to move to L.A and ask Emily out on a date. She is super cute!
Is it just me or is Emily super cute this morning!
Ha hahaha so funny 😂 I like Emily and Jordan there both so funny 😆
Emily and Jordan and Matt are probably the best comedic trio. Wow. Plz have more Plz have more.
dang, emiliy is one hella cute redhead
I love these episodes that give some spotlight to the Mythical Crew! You guys and gals rock! 😁😁
love the red and white shirts! feels like an independence day special episode😂 my fellow indonesian mythical beasts will understand lol
I don't think I've ever been this early lol

One day, maybe in 2034, this channel is going to upload a video that has these two doing nothing more than taste tasting the most delicious morsels. And that's the day I unfollow, real talk.

Get you a girl that looks at you the way Emily looks at Jordan
Wow
Eepp!! 1
Damn
Jordan: “look at his face (Link’s 🥰🥰🥰), he’s so cute!” Link REALLY IS SOOO CUTE!!!! He’s freaking ADORABLE!!! Who else agrees with me!?!? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wow you guys are running out of ideas
First!
Hipsters everywhere, except Emily, she's cool.
Use my comment as a like button to bring back the 2014 GMM.
Emily's hair looks really good in this video.  Is that just me, or does it look great!!!!
Me on a date: soooo... um... have you ever air fried dry ice?
You guys should make a "will it carbonate" video! Could use like a Soda Stream or something! I'm curious on how carbonated milk taste like 👌
“...and that’s taking piping hot socks out of your dryer and putting them directly on your feet.”
Rhett: “ oh on your feet huh-? 👀😏😏”
The episode was a cool idea but the things they fried weren't all that exciting except for the cheese and wine. Be cooler to see a air fried food vs fried food taste guess. But the fact that they made ice melting under heat and warm wet socks entertaining is impressive.
Rhett yelling NO DON’T at Link is the best part of this episode!
13:43... Why no one picked Rhett as a lab partner in Chemistry class.
Lol “DANG IT DANG IT DANG IT!”

Link: “...and if you take this off...”
Rhett: “NO DONT!!!!”
😂
14:06 omg, Link is so cute !!! “but you don’t :)” can we please appreciate how pure he is
1950: we will have instant food makers in 2019
2019: Rhett and Link are interested about how a wine glass dings
Rhett: I like my wine chunky
Memes: I LIKE THEM BIG, I LIKE THEM CHUNKY
4:01
This is random but this is my favorite Rhett hair to beard ratio ever
8:15 
Hey uh... Rhett what was that look man? 
Someone get YSL in here, We’ve had link being inappropriate but I think we need one of those for Rhett.
"Just throw a hatchamal in there" plop

~Rhett 2019
You should put random stuff in a carbonation machine like chocolate, milk, pigs blood, and cheeze
An air frier is not a deep frier without oil, it’s more of a faster oven. It’s just a convection oven, using air to circulate the heat around the food, cooking it faster and more easily than a conventional oven.
This was a good episode but I do wish they had done more edible stuff.
Rhett in that black shirt caught me off guard, looks really good 👌👌 shop at mythical dot store
Rhett's pickup line from this episode

"Hey baby, it's our last day on earth; you wanna play with a plump ball?"
When they said they were gonna drink the beverage I wanted to cry. He said hot chunky wine and I lost it.
@GoodMythicalMorning please make the dinking wine glass a gif on instagram.
"We made a BAAAAABY!"
"I think we brought it out a little early..."  lmao
What kind of question is that 






Of course I’ve air fried dry ice duhhhh 🤷🏻‍♀️🙄
"We made a BAAAAABY!"
"I think we brought it out a little early..." 😂
Would also love to see "Putting things in things; rock tumbler edition"
4:01 I like ‘em big. I like ‘em CHUNKY
Bros, I love your feet
Air fryers use "convection heated air" to "fry" stuff. Isn't that just an oven?
"It's like you're drinking a foot" - Link Neal, 2019
Absolutely love your videos have been subbed since you started and can’t stop watching your videos keep it up and you guys always cheer me up
My new life’s motto: Always balance the cheese.
Thats no air fryer. Thats an Halogen oven.
It's just a countertop convection oven. I don't know why people are so crazy about them
dry ice is DEFINITELY NOT "just water"
"Puting things in things" and "We mad a BABY!" Quotes from link
New socks fresh out the dryer is equal to the cold side of the pillow
4:29 Oh that made a very......*proceeds to dink and look at camera again* 
does it again 3 more times
The 29th is by birthday and this is one of my favorite episodes. COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!
That entire night:
Dinks glasses again
Link: :D
Rhett: :D
Call Tom Brady cuz this thing is PLUMP! 
- Rhett McLaughlin 2019
Link flirting with the mythical beasts at the end was too sweet
*me at 3 AM trying to go to sleep
* looks down
3:22:
Imagine having dry socks


This post was made by the soggy sock boi gang
Comfortable, I did not feel.  To see much feet, I did not wish.
I love you guys. The YMH podcast shined a light on you that allows me to trust you.
Anyone else cring when they toasted the wine glass and it was clashing notes😂
i was worried the football would go KABOOM
8:10 "oh on your feet huh? 😏😐" Rhett... Rhett, really? Really Rhett? 
(Also why do I understand what he was thinking??)
Link: I didn't realize it when my brain told me not to do something

Me: THIS IS WHAT HE DOES EVERYTIME HE SEES SOMETHING SHARP/DANGEROUS
You guys are sooooooo good at what you do. When ever I'm having a bad day i can always come on to YouTube and watch gmm and then my day is instantly made😊👍🐼
"The world is an air fryer" - Billy Corgan
Don't worry Link, I once grabbed a plate so hot it had a hole burnt through it

Twice

In 5 seconds

It was ceramic
ive always watched u guys since i was four on an different account and now im here again hows it going rhett and Link?
Nobody: 

YouTube: DEMONETIZED for drinking a DROPLET of wine!
The look on their faces when their glasses actually "dink".
15 min video but 5 second warning
I have an air fryer 😂 I got it for free. My company gave it to me.
Link doing the Will Smith at 4:17
Questioning the sanity of Kevin
I can always count on Rhett and Link when I wanna know more about science
14:13 "We made science happen in air fryers so you don't have to!"
Good Mythical Morning: We Made Science Happen
Okay so it kinda looks like the crew are just the LA version of the hooded figures from Nightvale. Anyone else?
I love how Link accidentally quoted will Smith 

Link: oh that’s hot let’s drink the wine first
Youresoloud better add that part 7:16 to a Link Being A Danger to Himself compilation.
WILL IT INSTANT NOODLE! LIKE IF U AGREE!
The world is a VAMPIRE

The world is an AIR FRYER
My mum bought one last week...
So far my experience hasn't been great
Call tom brady this is PLUMP😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10:08   "It's like when you pee on yourself, it feels good for a few seconds..."   OK there Rhett....  lol
I want my dry ice air fried please
you can make pizzas in air fryers which majes the crust like perfect omg 😩🤠
Rhett’s definition of water:

Noun: Solidified carbon dioxide
Link's brain: "IT'S HOT DON'T TOUCH IT!" 
                    . . .
Link: " BUUT I WANT TOO"

AAAH IT'S HOT
Air fried cheesy wine... im sure ive seen that at olive garden for $78 99

"Hmmm, nice crack Link." ~ Rhett • 2019
"We made a baabbbyyyy!" ~Link 2019 😂
Rhett and Link ringing the cheesy wine glasses for 10 hours
I ... kinda want a hachable just to crack it open lol
Being a bit of a plushie collector, it hurt my soul to see the hatchimals crushed then cooked.
Link is the jumpiest man I've ever seen
lol what were you implying about warm socks Rhett?  xD
2:01 Two shots of vodka (vine)
No one:
Good mythical morning: We should really air fry dried ice!!
Thanks to MaxMoeFoe i've come to realize that the Hatchimal Rett picked up with the gold wings was actually a rare one D:
"we made a babbbyyyy"
My favorite genre:
Sci-fry
Try putting cheese balls and cereal balls in there





Yea it's called dragons breath
🤣 Look it up I worked there
Not even 4 minutes in and Rhett has already drunk alcohol and made a wiener reference. DEMONETIZED
it burned because because there was gold foil on it
13:44 Oh Link 😂😂😂 that reaction was so visceral and indicative of how things usually end up when someone screams no at him when they're filming
#5 on trending! I love you guys so much❤️❤️❤️
7:39 "it's like a hot elephant covered in gum."
"Always balance the cheese"
-Rhett, 2019
2:55 Its like that guy in Indiana Jones WTFFFF
Will Smith: "Ohh, that's hot!"

Link: "Ohh, that's hot!"
On your feet huh 😉
Omg rheet you dirty 😂
Waiting for this video to appear in a youresoloud compilation
I thought Rhett’s shirt said thic for a second bc that was the only part of mythical I could see 😂
The fact you guys didn't wear gloves the entire time literally made me choke 🤣😂
They probably cooked the alcohol out of the wine. It’s probably more like grape juice at this point!!! 😂😂😂🤣
3:25
“Ladies, gentlemen. If you would kindly repair to the conservatory, the slurry will be served.”
The way Rhett said "Mm, das hot cheese" 😂
* during the wine and cheese section *
Mini Ladd: MMMMMMMMMMMMMM DAAAAARLING
Lol this is chemical equilibrium and thermodynamics. I’m going to study more for the AP today😣
Rhett is looking very lovely with this fresh haircut
10 hour version of Rhatt and Link clinging their wine Glass. Maybe we can we 10 hour ASMR version too.
GMM lifts my mood so much, but the guys seemed extra chipper today and it was so infectious!
"These socks are damp"




I wonder why...
You should do microwave next⚡⚡⚡
Has 15 seasons and over 1500 episodes of tasting, seeing, hearing, feeling and smelling werid, cool, amazing scary stuff.
Yet this still happens 4:30
"cheesy wine, this can't be bad"
*splat*
The world is a air fryer - smashing pumpkins
I’d be that snobby wine friend and judge you hard for choosing such a bad wine 😂
clinking wine glasses


Me: SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
“The World is an Air Fryer” is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins song
I like your videos they are awsome  keep up the great videos
Hahahahaha when Link grabs the plate I died. Incredible. Been there bro
What if the Lost Ark was actually the worlds oldest air fryer?
These kinda episodes are my favorite. ♥


Don't like if you disagree. ☺
7:15

How Link has managed to make it to 40 years old is a miracle
ON YURR FEET HUH

O no Rhett what have you done
You guys are very cool and funny 😊👍
You guys are the best ❤️
Keep it up you two, I’ve been watching for like 4 years...🤘🤘
I feel like Bill Nye or something
Yeaa something... 
Rhett always smoothing out the wrinkles.
Putting things on the plate completely defeats the purpose of an air fryer
I work nights so I always look forward to coming home and watching GMM 😍
I love when Link says something questionable and Rhett looks into the camera smiling XD
“WE mAdE a bAAbbbYyyYY”
Good for you, Link.
You two and your staff are what I look forward to when getting on YouTube
"in good mythical more." best part xD
I like how they tell is to never do this at home, but give us step by step instructions... lol
Lmfao “oh, on your feet huh?” God DAYUM 😂
Of course link burns his hands, I'm always nervous link is gonna hurt himself or someone else
I thought liquid would break/damage the thing. Good to know.
PUT IT IN A VAPE PEN!!!!
I miss your Amazingly Amazing Science "lessons" ☺️
5:35 “That’s hot cheese!”

Can you please put that on a shirt and have it in your store online?😂😂😂😂
You guys should try to get Adam Savage and /or Jamie Hyneman from Mythbusters for a show
Y'all used one of my favorite wines! 😍
Rhett's pinky toes is something that will haunt my dreams!!
WHAT
ARE 
THOSE?!?!?
You guys are my inspiration! I hope to grow and become like yall🤩❤️
8:30 are we not gonna acknowledge that amazing throw?
Rhett lessons:
Always balance cheese
Don't get your corn on the cob confused with your honey
This whole episode is full of perfect content for a "Link Struggling" compilation ^^
Why did I think I could eat breakfast while watching this oh jeez xD
Just wanted to pop in to tell you that Buddy System is truly one of the funniest series I've seen. I hope you guys eventually do a season 2. And remember...

"Don't pump the pump unless the pump is primed."

This has to be the most gangsta line ever about a water pump.
8:15 lmao Rhett 🤦🏾‍♀️🙈
anyone else up at 3:00 in the morning watching this right when it comes out?
7:16 i had to rewind it 16 times omg😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:42 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i literally can't stop laughing help
I love the fact that "Putting things in things" is a series.
“The world is an air fryer!” -billy corgan.
Yoursoloud has lots of new material
Putting things in things umm,😐 okay?
That looks like a convection oven not an air fryer lol
Air fryers cook so insanely fast. I got one, it’s great
Link can't be trusted around hot things either, he would probably touch lava too without thinking it's hot.
No way! Dry ice disappears when it thaws!? Daaaamn. That's almost like CO2!
Air fryer top uses: Chicken Wings and socks
7:43 is my wallpaper now
"oooo that's hot"
4:17
Perfectly balanced as everything should cheese
getting up just so can watch GMM is less impressive if you live in UTC
"on your feet, huh ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
for The Next Season Of GMM Do A Clay Stop Motion Of The Chicken
I need a 10 hour loop of Rhett and Link clinking glasses
I don't particularly understand. You literally just heated things up essentially.
Link “ oooh dats hot” like if u know the meme😂
That charcuterie board was a mess, but it does make me think the air fryer would be good for making mulled wine.
Rhett: “It’s like when you pee on ourself it feels good for a few seconds” 10:09 ummm, okay, Rhett...
Link’s reaction time at 13:58
It's so obvious Rhett has not use a rice cooker lol
His way of using those tongs to pick up the plate is cringy
Their videos are always trending 😭❤️
The way Rhett and Link say wet is like "whet" and I don't know how to feel about it.
4:33 someone please make a 10 hour version of them just bumping wine glasses
melted hatchimals and burnt footballs
YAY!
well... ammm.... at least in EUROPE... that is NOT  a fryer... is a PORTABLE OVEN!
a "Air fryer" is for example:  "Princess digital AEROFRYER XL"
portable ovens are: 
"Cecotec BAKE AND TOAST 570 4pizza"  (4pizza i don't know if is the PART OF NAME or the DESCRIPTION... well, i put it just in case)


Halogen convection oven (also by cecotec... and IT THAT,  JUST LIKE THAT, no air... HALOGEN CONVECTION... so... is a OVEN not a fryer)




¡¡Chaoo!! ;-)
4:36 should be a gif
Link Neal the Science Seal.👍🏻
I thought Davey was still in the navy
I love how David subtly turns down the temp every time link turns it up 8:55
I use my air fryer all the time and I even have an oil one. I actually prefer the air version.
just finished the new GOT episode, this is the perfect cool down lol
Thank you Link! I needed that at the end of finals week :,)
y’all should put stuff in an oil diffuser... just an idea 🤷🏼‍♀️
I once air frying my books

My teacher some how knew what I did .........

Next day


The person who's comment you are reading ,does not exist



Anymore
watching this as im eating an air fried pizza as im super drunk XD love yall, keep it up
Anybody else go full Billy Corgan when Link said "The world is an air fryer"? Despite all my rage, I am still just a guy putting things in things.
"Oh,on your feet huh?" Lol
Where's tha CROCKPOTS at tho?!?!  Kick it old school boys! Much Love Beasts 😉✌💚
Rhett: oh on you feet huh
Devilishly smile
Think the fog went away because of the fan in the fryer?
...Rhett loves boiled wine and melted, burnt cheese

As a drink

...Yep, bodysnatchers are real and one replaced Rhett
I think you two downed a bottle of wine b4 posting this vid.
Link: "it's like that guy in Indian Jones"
"uses convection to circulate hot air.." sooo you mean an oven?
That looks just like a halogen oven
Links Dave when he got scared😂‼️
Perfectly balanced cheese, as all things should be
Bill nye would be an amazing guest
Rewatching 1000th ep celebration and I wish I had a friendship like y'all

The innuendos always make my day. :D
Watching this while i air fry popcorn chicken 😆
Air fryers are just low capacity ovens and you can't convince me otherwise.
Link: das hot 
Will Smith:  dats hot
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode, Day 79: "We made a babyyyyy" - link
"oh, on the feet, huh?" HSJJS
You should put things in one of those soda streams
So air frying is just a more complicated form of baking?
Do not try this at home.....  They are basically saying don't air fry at home guys just do your usual oil fryer XD
“it’s like when you pee on yourself it feels good for a few seconds” -rhett 
i’m sorry. what????
I like how Rhett gets more excited everytime they clink glasses and Link’s just out of it.
Loved that Ace Ventura reference
Can you guys do more stuff where you do some beep beep research
Isn't an air fryer just a glorified oven or am I missing something?
When you guys were gonna put the hatchimal in the air fryer i was like:
You eating dat?
Ahhh yes the corm om a cob 😤😂
soo, an air-fryer is basically a toaster oven you open from the top? ...
LOl true story. Me seeing the thumbnail for this video and right clicking links face "open link in new tab".
Air fryer + dry ice = weather in Britain
Raising of temperatures speed up gas particles inside the ball, causing inflation. Charles Law! 😬👍 Woohoo for science
The Wolfe Pit reference? "We do this so you don't have to, FOR YOU THE PEOPLE" lol.
i feel so close to rhett after all these years staring deep into his eyes. keep romancing that camera my man!
Link: We made a baby!
Me: I thought neither of you wanted anymore children after the brosectomies lmao
Man this air frying has been around since I was 7
These guys get enjoyment out of every little thing, i love it. Need more of that attitude in my own life 💜💖
The Action Lab should start using an air fryer
I literally had to do a scientific presentation on dry ice today
Dog go watch Seinfeld for the best toasted cloths
This wine was made used feet to squash the grapes
They should do a game where they watch a clip of a compilation like youresoloud and have to guess the title. Like Rhett and link being southern bois!
This is random but this is my favorite Rhett hair to beard ratio ever
7:41 Links reaction is the funniest thing ever.
Rhett and Link and Mythical DOING IT IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE!
Air fryers are just tiny convection ovens. Like an easy bake for adults.
Bro,hatchimals are so expensive
Throw a Hatchimal in there! -Rhett 2019
Oo we're back to putting things in things!
Nobody: 


Rhett and Link: lets talk about that
Smashing pumpkins: the world is a vampire
Link: the world is dry ice!
If wine makes it classy, then I am classy AF!!
“Ohh, das hot” great t-shirt idea
Its legit just a portabel oven 😂 they’re just Baking stuff
Can't express my feelings enough about how I count every hour and minute to see a new episode.
Love you guys.
You guys are the best!!! Love you!!!❤️❤️❤️
You made Tommy Wiseau as well as myself very happy @11:40
This episode is full of youresoloud content
A lot of While The Cameras Are Still Rolling clips are going to be from here if they really wait for 8 mins to fry
Last week I saw someone using an air fryer and I though "I would like to see Rhett and Link putting thing in an air fryer" and boom! what a nice surprise with I saw the notification of Gmm. Thank you guys for making my wish come true!
Air Fryers are awesome!! You need one in your life ASAP!
Rhett: ladling the most disgusting liquid ive ever seen into a glass

Link: "this can't be bad, right?"
The nose on this one, WHOOO! LMAO
Making Gordon Ramsay proud
aka an oven?
I LOVE my air fryer! :)
So .. those who makes “Link being clumsy for 10 minutes” videos, you have like an abundance of clips to use here lol
7:42 lol his reaction was too funny
And now for the socks

Of course they are wet, the air dryer doesn't have a vent. There's no where for the steam to go
'Cause it STINKS!... but you don't :)'
cute Link 2019
4:36 an Xbox ad came on and it confused me because it sounded the same.
Did you kno that u guis are aw3some???
Also, I really think Link looks nice with plaid shirts on!!!
7:09 on .5x speed 

Thank me later
I did not know that air fryers and halogen ovens were the same thing. The
Rhett and Link prove Ideal Gas Law and poke fun of Tom Brady for something that was caused by the Ideal Gas Law all within a few seconds of a segment on a morning show.

What a time to be alive. Way to prove TB12's innocence.
Will Smith be like 4:18
This is my kind of science !
Link telling me that I don't stink made my day :)
Would you mind including temperatures in an accepted scientific scale rather than just your home made one? Thanks.
remake the Unicorn Rap
Fun fact, every "putting things in things" is a double episode. They put weird things in other things and simultaneously put joy in my day

Link is my spirit animal
Rhett aRE YOU DRINKING ON THE JOB
Air fryers make it so easy to cook
Link: * sizzling sound * :: lets go of plate :: repeats twice more. LOL
Plz react to Yoursoloud please
Great video but it's a halogen oven not an air fryer there is quite a bit of difference.
Am I just missing something or is an air fryer basically just an oven?
guys, this is a halogen cooker not an air fryer
Socks from the dryer in the winter is awesome
When they drink the wine, good mythical bye 👋
7:20 I can see the next youresoloud video already.
haha i was drinking wine while watching this
 #class
The only letters I can read on Rhett's sweater are "THIC".

Air fry pieces of siding to see which one stands up best to the desert heat!
And this is how you create the new laws of science

3:21 Rhett, no-
Air Fryer aka An Oven.
Please do a episode with Mr Beast
I'm finally up early enough to watch this when it was uploaded 😂
I hope someone sent this video to Lapoliean 😂
This episode has reminded me why Link isn't entrusted with knives.
Is there not someone who has noticed the "OH THAT'S HOT" at 4:17 ??
8:11 RHETT I SAW YOU HM
I love the looks on Links face as Rhett is pouring the wine 🍷 in the glasses
omg rhett was just having so much fun with his new  honey-wine-cheese dipping sauce
480 let's go all the wayty.... Lol
4:18 ooh that’s hot flashback to Rewind

You could've called it "Will It Airfry"
Rhett-Oh on your feet huh?*looks around*
OOHH! CIRCLE!!
4:02 = I like em big I like em chunky ( chunky )
Hahaha ^^ I know Rhetts shirt/ jumper says mythical, but all I could see in the light was thic ^^
Link: And then if I take this off..
Rhett: nO dOn'T!
L: shuffles back in fright as he puts the lid back on
R: laughing I scared you didn't I... it's easy to get you worked up!
L: Well I don't know what I'mma bout to do-

This seems dangerous. I'm in!
Wow I remember back in the water filter vid I suggested they should do air fryer lol
I couldn't do the wine and cheese one because it would kill me, y'all put blue cheese in there man...
freeze dry food and do a blind taste test.
Air fry a jalepeno.  Y'all can thank me later.
4:01 moto moto has entered the chat
Finally, the McElroy brothers understand what hot grapes taste like
Where are you getting these ideas? Do you sit at like a meeting table, someone raises their hand, "Oh! I know! Let's air fry dry ice because that's an essential piece of knowledge!" 
....
All jokes aside, I love your content❤
No wonder my state bans these cooking devices
13:43 Rhett killed me XD
4-80 all the waytee! 😂
"Air fried for safety"
THANK YOU FOR HELPING SMOSH YOU BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE(everyone not just R&L)
That is a halogen cooker not an air fryer ?
heyzues christo Rhetts feet are like a prehistoric river bed
Watching them put wet socks on hurt me.
4:18 💕Will Smith?💕
I would've been satisfied if you would've just air fried normal foods lol
Pizza rolls + Air Fryer = 🔥
Mwahaha finally, hot grapes MBMBAM reference anyone?
I still think you never can have to much cheese :)
Socks are still wet because the wet air didn't leave
5 min cracked me up
13:42 had me laughing so much!
is it bad that i kept replaying link touching the hot plate?? 😂🙈
Is it bad that I'm kinda hoping for another fire hazard?
it would have been better if you had made some edible food in that 
air fryer.  we have an air fryer, and it makes great french fries and 
tater tots!!
Watching a video about an air fryer and i get a midroll ad about air fryers.
I absolutely love Rhett's subtle dirty jokes
I knew as soon as Link put the plate in the air fryer that he was going to try and pick it up again when it was super hot.
4:16 is anybody else thinking what I'm thinking?
Air fryer, aka: an oven
I saw an air fryer a couple of days ago in a store for the first time and now this 🤔 Is the universe trying to tell me something?? Does it want me to buy one? 😂
Leaving work at 3am (Dennys) and I'm blessed by this video noice
14:13 aww mannn. WE LOVE YOU LINK 😭

The cheese must be perfectly balanced as all things should be.
bad episode is bad
try again
Link probably watches vannos because he said habida
it's confirmed rhett has the taste buds of a raccoon
Is it just me or was Link really off his shit this episode? Lol. Like dude was on some sort of drugs or something.
"its like a hot elephant covered in gunk"
For YOU...the People!
Are you sure that is an air fryer it looks more like a halogen oven

Is this a convection oven... Or an air fryer?
They should’ve breaded everything first lol
Anyone else catch the sock joke from Rhett? 😂😂😂
I dont like air fryers.     Because the oil makes fried food good.  Cause i love greasy stuuf
Unskippable ads 😖
My dream is to get the silver play button
Omg today’s episode was so funny 😂 XD
Laws of thermodynamics dictate that NE didn't inflate or deflate anything. Temperature of objects decrease in pressure the colder the object is... IRC the game was well below freezing, NE didn't cover their footballs, while the opponents had the covered with blankets. Not to mention, NE footballs were meseared at the start of halftime, inside. While the opponents go them measured at the end of halftime, inside... Giving the  time discrepancy, the opponents had 20min to warm up in a 75+ degree environment, and normalize the pressure at which is was inflated at.
OMG I’m going to throw up looking at the wine in the glass XD
Hold up. Wait a minute. I just now realised I haven't got a singular notification of your uploads or even a suggested for you from your channel in over a year! Nandesu-ka?
Yay for gmm science, we have now discovered that link cannot be trusted around hot things either lol
8:10 😂 I see you Rhett 👀 🧦
I love air fryers

When Link touched the hot plate not once, but three (3) times😂
The thing I look forward to most to start off my week 😊
Personally, my mouth hasn't seen anything.
4:18 ooh thats hot (from youtube rewind)
Dry ice,and water in a sealed container usually explodes
I can't tell if his hair is cut or laid down?? Looks CLASSY

Make  Will it  Butter : fastf ood edition
This channel used to be so good it makes me so sad to see how uve advanced everything about it except the content...
Sometimes Rhett looks at the camera like Jim from The Office😂
>Wetness has no way to escape the fryer
>Sock is still wet
Rhett:
:O
LeT Me LaDlE yoU sOmE BeveRaGe
Link: take them out of the dryer and immediately put it on your feet
Rhett: you put it on your feet? methodically looks at the camera and link has no idea what he's talking about
Why is Link dubbed at the end?
People with a foot fetish are gonna love this video xD
No drinking on the job Rhett!!!!😂
Yes link I have put dry ice in a air fryer 




Dont assume
So, like an oven, but for hipsters?
Weirdos.
Like.
If you put clothes in an actual dryer for 15min they would still be wet, so what did you expect!? lol
Good Mythical Morning!
Love from an artist YouTuber ❤💜🧡💕
Nothing Rhett and Link have eaten on this show ever before has grossed me out like that hot wine and cheese. 🤢😂
is it a good idea to air fry this?
Rhett is so douchey i figured he'd have bought one with his ski boots. 🤣🤣😉😉
is the transition tune scooby dooby doo
Notification Squad 💕👈🏻😇
is it a good idea to air fry this?
It's almost a fondue.
For the longest time I thought their studio was in a tree house
APOTHIC RED IS AN AMAZING WINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woah, a GMM episode that fits Europe time? Am I dreaming?
You guys gunna change up the intro next season?
I wonder why people dislike these guys. They're great.
Execution on this video isnt great
on your feet huh? wink
This is how my dad gets away with frying all if our food we eat 😂
I almost threw up at the first one they did. 🤢
So, how is "air fryer" not just another word for "oven"?
9:42 your inner North Carolinain is coming out Link and I live for it omg
3:27 not a good time to be eating fruit suspended in jello
You should have had ice cube as a guest.
Wierd question but anybody know what shirt Link has on in this video? Or brand maybe?  I really like it..
13:43 made me laugh so hard lmaooo
An oven...with a fan. Brilliant!
I was so sure a can of sprite was going to emerge from the dry ice
GMM is the only youtube channel that upload when im bored at 3am every night
I want to see a sequel, but for them to cook actual foods.
A civil and a chemical engineer.
3:21 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The melted Hatchimal looks like a marshmallow Peep!!! 😊😊😊😊
Links hair tho we all love it
So it's a fryer that uses convection to circulate hot air to "fry" food..... Pretty sure that's called "baking" lol.
Like the last intro better
You did will it deep fry now will it air fry
-_- dont come for brady
That’s not an air fryer!! It’s pretty much a convection oven
Ah so this is the episode where they tried to kill the Smosh people by air frying a shoe/football, lmfao XD
Rhet Link do a speech jam sing off
You know you’ve stayed up too late when you get the gmm notification
Rhett: "Look theres a lil baby in there!! You could probably grab that baby!"


Link: "I  aint grabbing nothing now!!"


Rhett: grabs molten lava baby anyway "WHOAA HEYYYYY"


Lmaoooo actual tears!!!!
11:30 reminds me of the Maddballs toys from the 80/90s

Go to bed you crazy mythical insomniacs
Fried food vs. air fryer food
Go all the way down
4:34 if no one makes a gif out of that 😂😭
Rhett had the best time with the wine and cheese
Isn't this just a convection oven? How is this a new trend? Also, just one tong for plates! Solid episode!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
when GMM starts a restaurant they will serve warm damp socks instead of washcloths.
Rhett and Link burning themselves for 14 mins
Lesson learned don't drink something at the same time Rhett exclaims his love for stinky foot wine
Cuz of all tha salt
Coming in right after last night's "Game of Thrones" episode.
I love my air fryer it makes all my leftovers taste as if they  were just made
tom Brady would beat u up
Why do I watch these things while I'm eating?
Link at 7:45 😂😂❤️
Started watching this and forgot that there was a comment section. Good mythical morning to all of you actually watching this in the morning 😂
“You are a man who once drank cat urine.”
“It was cat feces.”
Ah yes, Link’s all time dumbest moment. Drinking the run off of the LifeStraw
Wine clinking ASMR
8:10 underappreciate joke
All these years and they still ask themselves "this can't be bad right?"
Well. I changed my mind if i can fry cheese with wine i am in.
How about Dry ice vs a pool of Lava
Thats because theres a fan and vent, bill nye
Nobody :
Dan Schneider : 9:06
You guys need to do more Forest Patrol. Forest Partrol needs to be a Netflix original! Haha
5 am right on time! Good Mythical Morning!!
A whole new meaning to having cheese with your wine lol
13:42 that jump by link was gold
Dry ice (aka carbon dioxide) indoors in a fryer, is that not extremely dangerous. I hope they had good ventilation.
Y'all best stop "BURNING" TB12
Is it just me or when they clinked glasses together reminded me of endgame. Not a spoiler
10:05 rhett keeping it real 😂
11:25 Geeez that looks like a real flesh wound 😩
Apothic red wine is good wine for the price at Walmart lol
Dry ice is carbon dioxide in its solid form, and it turns into gas when exposed to open air. The carbon dioxide can then displace oxygen in the air, which can cause difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and death, according to The News Tribune. The fumes are especially dangerous in enclosed spaces LMAO
Definitely a few compilation moments in here :’)
I still haven't learnt to not watch a GMM episode that involves food while hungry ......😥😥
I've had an air fryer for at least 10 years now. Why is it a new thing now?
7:15 
THANK ME LATER
Does anyone know where to get this air fryer...?
I don't know what is air frying. 

Don't buy that Rhett. Sometimes Link do mistakes. This is like air dryer 😁
I had to watch bc if you sealed dry ice in a sealable container it would be a pressure cooker bomb. Glad it wasn’t sealed
4:18 will smith (oohhh thays hawt)
Rhet being a dirty boy about the warm socks
Rhett you’re wrong for that with the socks and the look lmao
I wish there was footage of a football igniting and destroying an air fryer...
how is it frying if u dont use oil
They should do a “will it” episode of the air fryer
just use an oven, works even better haha
Am I the only one who had never heard of an air fryer?
Ah yes, Fry Ice.
I feel like wine with cheese already in it is like the bougie version of Goober Grape.
“Looks like that guy in Indiana Jones”

But yall didnt crank it to 480 qtf
How do you guys not have stomach problems 😂😂😂😂
Oh so many memes
Who still remember there first intro??
I was literally reloading your page since 6:00 on the dot and I don’t get here until 430 views?? Booo
This is not an air fryer, this is a halogen oven. Quite different
7:36 it's a bit like surgery
for a second i though this whole air frying this was gonna be another prank on link like the anti-spice pill episode
withered grapes aka raisins lol
“Cause it stinks! But you don’t!” -Link 2019
first up, wine and cheese. next..... idk some weird toy or somethin
You should have done the dry ice with no water
mariam webster defines fry as: to cook in a pan or on a griddle over heat especially with the use of FAT
They do realize that by adding heat to a pressurized system with expanding gases is essentially making a bomb
“Putting things in things” link- 2019 








End of YouTube as we know it.
So is the air fryer just a fast oven or...?
3:22

Thats not an air fryer that's a halogen oven
It’s like a hot elephant covered in gum- top ten famous last words

can't think of anything to comment
It's mine! Not mines!
is this not just an oven
Hi. Have a lovely day. 💓
I’ve noticed they been drinking more lately lol
Who's watching this in 6am?
It uses oil tho... just not as much :)
The whole point of air fryers is that they use less oil (like a tspoon) not no oil. An oiless air fryer is just an oven.
13:43 you’re welcome 😂😂😂
billnie the guy i don't now to spell his name
Anyone else get the impression Rhett an Link got into the SPECIAL cupcakes again before filming 😹
Keep grabbing it... deeeee
Wow these guys are really awesome lol😂😂
7:20 lol😂
Did you borrow that football from the Patriots?
Pretty sure that's a turbo oven, not an air fryer
Feels like a Dan Schneider episode. Too much foot action
11:00 "hike hike!!... or is it, huthut?.." 🤣
Laces out Marino!
Rhett and link role reversal. Rhett was the reckless one
Anyone else watch these in the morning and then rewatch them in the evening because you were too tired in the morning to understand what was going on? Just me? 😂
Link being his clumsy self again
That’s a bad air fryer
You guys should get a air fryer because it is worth it
we need an episode dedicated to just wine
Who else knew this was coming eventually?
Make a vid with Ed Sheeran!
wait, im pretty sure this was the thing mentioned on the R+L smoshcast episode.  Where they talked about the crew air-frying shoes and a lot of bad fumes coming out.
11:35 That Tom Brady burn though!
You need to make a WILL IT AIR FRY ... Just an idea ;-)
Use me as a "Good Mythical Morning" Button
That's a Halogen Cooker, not an Air Fryer.
I won’t try it at home. I’ll try it outside in the neighbors yard.
Am I the only one who sang, "The world is an air fryer..." to the tune of Bullet With Butterfly Wings?
As hard as I tried to be one of the first likers, I was still the 185...
14:10 no promises lol
Footballs have never been made with pig skin.  They were originally made with animal bladders sometimes pig bladder that's where its believed "pigskin" came from. that fell out of play sometime in the 1860s. Then they started to use rubber and cowhide which had to be a better experience for the players and the people who had to blow up the bladder or stuff it with hay lol.
The dry ice was really cool!
put weird things in a pressure cooker
I love my air fyer!! Best invention ever imo.
This video is a perfect video to make for those compilation channels
this is a halogen oven not an air fryer.
I hate how it's called a air fryer. It's a toaster oven.
air fryer i like deep fryers
I'm pretty convinced Rhett doesnt even take sips anymore he just touches it to his lips and overreacts
So, how often do they change their intro animation?
When link touches something hot he always goes in for more touches and it stresses me out so bad
“Oh on your feet “huh”
"we are going to be air frying things that i guarantee your mouth ain't ever seen before!"
don't worry Rhett, I have you covered. I have 2 air fryers, a 5.3L and a 6L. the 6L is a chefman air fryer+ and also does dehydrating and rotisserie.
if you strained the cheese solids from the wine and then tried to reform it, youd probably have some pretty good cheese
“I like my wine c h u n k y”

I imagine 7:28 is what planned parenthood looks like 2 minutes after it opens for the day
In Malta we call this appliance a grillioso
RHETT! You had every opportunity to say "Were playing hot potato!" And you went with "were playing catch!" !?
dinking intensifies
That's a hot air cooker, basically a small oven. Not an air fryer.
Came for my daily dose of gmm
0:19 to 0:24 
Good talk
when is the mythical pomade coming back in stock?
I imagine use them glassware for singing Christmas music
first... but more importantly. Hi. I love you.
I need to get one it looks cool :)
It's got sort of an oaky afterbirth... 4:42
Air dried bacon is awesome!
Links face at 3:43 😂😂😂
Dont talk bad about my tom brady now!
I have that one, the metal ring is for extending it to be larger, no need to keep it around the glass.
4:44, did Rhett say F*** me?? HAHA
4:40 was that an F#?
Shrek hits the dab in endgame
at 4:12 links little smile after the cheesy compliment was adorable
My daughter is obessed with hatchimals... I find them everywhere. It's like where's Waldo, but I step on them and my soul leaves my body
666k views oh god
One time, I tried to put my wet socks in my friend's sister's microwave to dry them...it wasn't a good idea.
5:27 Rhett bites from the same area that Link bites from. I guess Rhett has herpes now
This should’ve been an episode of “will it?”
ugh chunky liquid makes me puke i really didnt want to see chunky wine
Is it just me but the looks like a halogen cooker not an air fryer.
The Hatchimals look like melted marshmallows...
Air fryer...AKA an oven...?
4:36 you guys are so cute
Rhett and link feet I end the video early.
When ur girl is in bed with u 3:22
When he got scared 😂😂😂😂😂
“oh on your feet huh?”
Link Nye the Science Guy!
This is basically just ‘Will it Air-Fry?’
Thanks for still doing silly videos once in a while. It’s refreshing
I couldn't have eaten the first one, resembled a gut pile to much.
David giveth and David taketh away
i have one and it changed my life
7:15 yoursoloud...
Man this episode really socks!
NO DONT !! 🤣🤣🤣
Have you had charcuterie today?
13:44 "Click on to GMMore to see us Air-fry Links soiled underwear!"
U guys should make a game show
Ah that's hot...  That's hottt.
I’m literally watching this while eating something cooked in an air fryer
Oh my cousin has a air fryer and the food be soooooo good
7:15 another for the montage of link being a danger for himself
This episode is a youresoloud goldmine
11:25 I was really stressed the ball will blows up on their faces
Try four loko taste test
Seems like a fancy oven to me

Lol my grandma has an airfryer
They've been dinking wine glasses for the first time XD
Rhett has Meryl Streep cheeks when he smiles
"its just water" rhett it is absolutely not just water
I don't think an episode of GMM has ever made me more worried for their safety D:
My favorite childhood game. Catch the scalding hot football
13:46 put the speed on .25x and listen for like 10 seconds
I feel like there’s one constant in the comment section. The one or multiple people saying that yoursoloud is going to have a hay day 😂
3:22  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Why am I eating while watching this
That device looks more oveny than fryery
Link said "ooh that's hot" the same way he said "ooh she's tight" in giant jenga
As soon as the football went in I knew, there was going to be a tom brady joke.
So youre telling me.....that the western people don't have that as a staple???? Man, in the Philippines, we all have that for chicken. We call it "turbong manok"
y'all are gross xD ^
Does the dry ice vapor form a 'cyclone' because perhaps there is a vent that spins the air inside of it?
Thomas Jones
binge worthy content am i right?!
my dad got one a couple christmases ago and he lovES it and loves making chicken wings in it for parties bc they taste exactly the same but are supposedly healthier lol
I thought that's a broiler.. 😑
“But u don’t” 😂😂😂
I was assuming they were going to eat everything they put in, that was until they put the plastic EGG inside lmao
lets throw a burnt football in there!
Do another putting things in things please
i bet they would love to smell that burnt football in the smosh studio....
Downvoted for touching glasses five times.
Sooo it's an oven?
Part II  !!!
Love my air fryer
14:50 is when the video gets good
What a MORON. how do you burn yourself where was your common sense
You ever watch an episode and see things that Link does that are bound to be in a “Link being clumsy for 7 minutes straight”?
An in the summer  you put them in the frezzer
lAcEs To ThE sIdE
Cheese undertones of the wine 😂
Did anyone else smell the wine?
Put weird things in a soda maker!
4:30 Rhett and Link dink red wine and cheese glasses for 5 hours straight
That’s an oven, not an air fryer...
Right he put them on his feet
I love you guys to death but you desperately need some new ideas
The Football worked because heat causes things to expand
That plate was as hot as a spoon in Amy Winehouse’s house
2:14, drinking on the job
Ive always kinda assumed rhett would be a really good and fun lover cause he likes "gross" stuff like stinky cheese ;)
Yeah no. If I'm going to "fry" something I'll stir fry it in a tidbit of oil.
3:23 is when my dirty mind woke up again
If there's no fat or oil, it's not fried. ;) Great episode though!!
I have an air fryer put coconut shrimp in it
Some day Rhett and Link will explode themselves doing these kinds of experiments XD
What brand air fryer is that
#DeflateGate
Rhett at 13:43 is me when my friends take my advice
I'm still waiting for a smosh gmm cross over
You should put stuff in a air humidifier
Why didn't they just call it "will it airfry"?
4:16 OH THATS HOT
Rhett is COOKED 💨 😂
I think you should redo this but with actual food to give us examples of things we can actually do at home (Will it air fry?)
Rhett's face whenever he surprisingly likes something lol
Rhett: on your feet, huh? sly grin to the mythical beasts
13:44 link gets scared to death 😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😂😂😂😂
Yes. On your FEET, Rhett... 🤦🏻‍♀️ Rhett isn’t kinky he’s just weird. 😂😂😂
8:12 the way rhett look at the people who get the joke lol
14:10 to 14:14 That was really sweet :)
Man I was hoping they would put a hot pocket in there.
I Thought that they were called Halogen Ovens?
The liquid in the dry ice is liquid Co2! It’s very rare and hard to get! U guys made it and a lot of it!
7:08 
We made a babyyyyyyy
You put the thic in mythical
7:44 wHAT WAS THAT
You made  baby eh? lmaoo
We all just going to ignore the fact that this is an Infrared Cooker and not an Air Fryer?!
I miss their “boop-boop-boo-dee-doop-boop” 📡(research) episodes... you can call all these segments different but they all feel the damn same. Left on a shelf? This?
I understand “Will It” popularized them but this is getting so stale..I find myself enjoying GMMore than the official show
5:34 ahh thats hot thats hot
hatchimals community has left chat
Why is no one in the comments talking about the hot socks and how rhett reacted 😂😂
How did no one catch the dirty sock jokes Rhett was trying to make😭
I got a Burt’s Bees ad when I clicked on this video, and when the ad was over, I had five different Burt’s Bees chapsticks.
An air fryer, is an oven???
Why not “WILL IT AIRFRY”
Did anyone else know, the second Rhett put the plate on the table, that Link was going to grab it? 







It was inevitable.
so this is a electric oven?
10:36 it's a patriots football
Why didn’t you do more things that you could eat?
It’s not an air fryer tho.
Will it wine?
Kud you say that you chikd in
But I really wanted to see it fry food lol....
Yo I love my air fryer! I’m making corn dogs right now
You guys are so much better than collins keys!
Why not try something that's already fried just in another way
Only Rhett & Link can think that melting plastic is a good idea lol
my mother got a convection oven as a christmas gift its ok we dont use it that often
0:43 did Rhett say the n-word
Rhett 8:10 🤣😂
rhett is a man of culture, boy knows the sock trick
lol so many ball jokes :)
10:15 soggy bottom boys??? ;D
Put some poop in an Air Fryer and see what happens.
Cooked grapes?
#RhettBeingAHungryBoiFor7Mins
Air fryers are stupid ,just use your oven . Pretty much same result
rhett looks like wolverine low key
Love y’all food tasting vids
If you wanna make a sacrifice, eat food that's been air fried!
12:09 you came here for this, you’re welcome
Seems like an oven
4:17 aw, thats hot
Whoever thought it was a good idea to let Link near the air fryer or anything hot or sharp??
11:52 I don’t have a joke the mythical editors were just begging us to time stamp this
The wet socks made me gag lol
That cheese wine made me gag.
4:53 please someone make a gif of  Rhett's face, it kills me everytime
That's just an oven.
3:20 im glad it did
Next youresoloud video should be “link spazzing out for 8 minutes straight”
Your lucky that rat saved you
That's an halogen oven not an air fryer as they are in the UK
pretty sure that's just a halogen oven
Tony Stark dies at the end of endgame.
Rhett just casually eats half a cheese at 5:31
Is it me or is that the Nike symbol on the football
I have to be honest... Air fryers cook food exactly like a toaster oven. I can't tell the difference between the two.
Why in the world would anyone mention the name Bill Nye and science together in the same sentence?
Amazing 😉
You should put good mythical morning on Netflix
8:07 Is it weird that I wish I was a guy so I could try that? I just feel like I’m missing out
The foot fetishists are happy today.
Feels so weird to get back to GMM. Been watching you for years  and started watching you with my ex. Haven't watched a single episode after the break up and trying to get back ;_;
When did the live studio audience become a thing? The laughs get louder each sode, not complaining. :)
13:20 And all this time I thought the world was a vampire.
Caught ya looking Rhett.
8:05 💀
Who doesn't want their wine chunky? It all ends up in the same place anyway, right???
Damnur old
Tefel Actifry 👌🏻
This is torturous.
Drinks the glass one time too hard then it smashes hahaha
Paul Rudd is links identical twin
we have an air fryer and it is the best thing to happen to my family because my dad had gotten third degree burns on his legs from oil and so one of my family members sent it as a joke and it has worked wonders for us
For some reason I forgot cheese could melt......
Will it air fry
Can I just say, I’m from the UK and they were a thing like, 3-5 yrs ago 😂
Why did I read police in the thumbnail
Why does that football look like two face from the Dark Knight?
Is it me or does Link get dumber every episode?
Cling clang CLANG CRASH
Technically putting a football in a microwave WOULD slightly “inflate” it. Because of the increased temperature, there would also be an increase of pressure re-inflating the ball...this relationship is called “Charle’s Law” and is a property of chemical gas laws...but probably don’t stick a flammable object in a microwave....
Hello from Jordan
10:37 Uhhh yeah hot gasses tend to expand
I gagged just watching the wine with cheese in it
Those look like canning tongs.
Can you put my exes heart in there to warm it up?
WHAT HAPPEND TO THE OG INTRO 😢😭😭😭 when did they change it
I hate both of your personalities and your faces. But do enjoy the show due to your interesting topics
When the air fryer episode doesn't even have an air fryer?? You got 10+ crew, and no one researched it?
I can't find the shirt rhett is wearing 😔😔😔😔 please help...?
Do this with a dehydrator
my aunt got a air fryer  because she was using a normal one and her kitchen burnt down.
This video would’ve been better with food that you don’t normally cook with an air fryer because this was kinda of lame
Honestly Rhett is super little! I know when some1 has been hitting the edibles haha I bet he thinks they don't smell but we can see pillowsbunder eyes haha and ubhot munchies on camera lmao
“Thas hot”
Why does Rhett’s hair look really good right now? Omg
Of course the socks are wet they are cooking in steam that’s the point of the air fryer
7:08 the best
@13:43 😂
Sooo..... its an oven?
That's a broiler
Is anybody concerned else with how small Rhett’s toes
Oh god no guys noooo
I have this air fryer, and I’m currently making a pizza in it😂
Love y’all food tasting vids
3:22 That's what she said
link is a stoner thats a pure stoner move on the plate
You should have put a Marsh mellow in and watched it grow. Then eat it
That’s an infrared cooker
This was a funny episode
Link said habada .. 🦉
So... what's the intended application of this thing? What are you supposed to cook with it?
3:22 lmao
Nice haircut rhett
Watching this while pregnant is a bad idea but... I can’t stop.
Will it Air Fry?
HOT GRAPES
Face*^
What about the instant pot
I’m so tired that when they did the dry ice one I literally blew at the screen because I wanted to blow on the fog.
Do you understand how cool your job is
i could smell this video
oh no, the foot fetish-ers are here
9:33 that's what she said blue
Aren't you supposed to use some oil? Otherwise this is just an oven.
Rhett looking like a delicious vanilla ice cream cone. Issa snack
how many air fryers do they use to nake these episodes?
they should do a top 5 fan favourite thing again but eith top 5 things said on gmm and top 5 chaarecters such a cotton candy randy
“It’s like a hot elephant covered in gum.”
Rhett always looked stoned
In my childhood, it was some TV thing called, flavorwave
Is it just me, or has Link been looking a little lit these last few episodes . . .
this doesnt even make sense
7:41😂😂😂
Ahhh...a plaid dad. Just the thing I want to see to brighten my day or in this case night.
You should rate the best gluten free beer
guys u still have to wrap the food in dough
The dingo ate your baby.
14:14
13:43 😂😂
13:43 😂😂
U guys are like the band that wears their own shirts.... tards
so this is what smosh was talking about with the football
An air frier is just a small oven tbh.
Does anyone else call them Halogens and not Air Dryers?
Missed opportunity to play literal hot potato with that football
Should've drank the dry ice water too
Confused beings stuck in the physical realm regressed into tinkering monkeys. Unable to access the spiritual realm...they are lost and without true purpose.
I put a damp sock in the microwave once, it caught on fire and I had to buy a new microwave.
We maaade a BAAAABYYYYY
Ray finkle
that looks like the vomit after i drank too much wine
“Oh, on your feet, huh?” Cheeky Rhett
There was something very satisfying about watching Link burn himself. It’s like you know it’s coming
I’m new to the channel.. u guys are awesome
The number of times Link hurts himself in this....
Soggy Sock Bois 😆
Why did they add water for the dry ice?
What happened at 4:31
Yoursoloud will have a great time with 9:47
Oof...I’m that wine and cheese friend
At 4:38 when Rhett and link were dinking cups an ad came on asking if I knew anyone with a disability lol
Nuwave??? Cooker???
No proof
12:30 thank me later
Aren't air fryers just small bad ovens?
You can air fri McDonald's fries they are just as good ak so any McDonald's breakfast sandwich too cause they all soggy now and not tosted anymore
They need to stop changing their into I like the old ones better😔
*Hand egg*
Rhett likes 'em big, he likes 'em chunky
4:17 Will smith
Rhett @ 8:14 lol he looks at the camera like it’s the office links so innocent he never gets the joke r/woooosh
i came here literally to watch them dink their glasses together 5 times like literal children lmao
Cool vid! Can you do another will it deep fry?
11:53 playing hot potato with a air fried football
You guys should do a weird food competition video where people comment things.
They made The Hound of footballs.
I love your video
I guess they wanted to take a break on this episode.
EndGame- iron man dies 
Lets Talk about it
9:51
Every day is a reminder of why no one trusts link with anything dangerous. Even when they go on other channels
40 year old men with degrees air fry a football and forget that air expands when it's warm. -.-
Air fryer? Penggoreng angin??
I was under the impression the point of an air fryer is that you CONTINUE using oil, you just use significantly less of it in comparison to a deep fat fryer?
GROSS BUT I CANT STOP WATCHING
Have you ever air fried and air fryer?
Over a million views in a day!!
That metal ring was supposed to be used as a spacer to make it taller for larger items.... if you used it that way i dont think the football would have burned like that lol
Good stuff
9:07 Dan Shnyder
Looks baked to me.
Mia Khalifa
On your feet huh
A stove burner turned upside down with a fan that blows the hot air around food:   Seems fried to me.  Let’s call it “air fryer”.  In all reality I love my air fryer.
I hate link he ruins everything
I see how this show works now. After Rhett throws a party at his house, he brings the leftovers to work so they can air fry them and stick them in jars of random fluids for a month. 😂 Smart. I think that qualifies as recycling.
Scooby dooby doo
@youresoloud
Rhett's face at 8:15 is hilarious when he says, " Oh on your feet huh?" Then he gives the camera a hilarious look!
I can’t believe the socks were still wet
What happens to things in an oven
This is secretly a foot fetish video
Hey Rhett and link, have you guys seen endgame?
3:21....
Link is a bellend.
“It’s like, when you pee on yourself it feels good for a few seconds” -Rhett McLaughlin
I feel like this show has become too formulaic. We used to wake up early everyday to watch gmm, the remote segments, the wondering if what the next episode would bring was great, but now i can't watch it hardly anymore. It seems like every episode is a "will it" or Snack v snack episode. It's become too predictable and calculated. I miss old gmm
Why is it called putting things in things
4:40 and then it breaks..
Ugh, Link is just so lame and goober-ish.
Have you ever air fried water?
666k
Funny how something that has been out for 30 years can suddenly get so popular.
13:40 NO DONT
Rhett talking about wine: I like em big... I like em chunky...
so it an oven with a fan? k

a hatchimals is a depressing chocolate free kinder egg lmao
Nickle
DANG IT DANG IT DANG IT
“Soggy Sock Bois”
Next time leave the aluminum halo out, gives us a better view of drippings; its actually used to add height to the lid.
Hasta la vista baby 😂
Upon further viewing, I have come to realize that I don't actually enjoy watching Rhett nor Link. Link is needlessly over reactionary to everything and acts as if he's going to die from simple things like eating a vegetable. Rhett, on the other hand, I have noticed slight deviations in how he talks about certain people and makes me think his inclinations are less than wholesome.  It was a short ride but I'm ready to get off now.
Will it oreo
3:22
3:22
“Yes because of all the salt”
Am I the only one who hates the wine glass clink in the beginning
9:49 rett found the poop sock
She knows what she's doing
Do the 10 strangest candies in the world !!! And guess where they are from. I want darts !!!
I do not want to know what Rhett does to warm socks o.0
Oven?
Possible
What a waste of wine, you monsters! 😢
I skipped over the foot fetish bit
Haha awesome
Can y’all bring Candice Patton back on
I’m going to Rhett and links show and I’ve never been more excited
Rhett and Link were on the smoshcast and Ian was talking about fumes that were released into the studio from the football. He thought there was a gas leak and needed to evacuate.
A comment from your possibly oldest fan (my dad): Rhett and Link are either humble geniuses on Einstein's level or just a couple of first graders that never grew up. The experiments they do may seem stupid and ridiculous but out there somewhere, is a scientist doing the same experiments, and we will find them someday! And remember Rhett, don't forget to balance the cheese :-).
comment
Of course Link is touching hot things and burning himself once again😂
What about an air fried vs. deep fried taste test?
Wet socks 😖
7:08
I LOVE my air fryer!! I have the Ninja brand and use it daily.
Link:Ooo das hot
Will smith:oo das hot


Link is will smith confirmed
The indignation in Rhett’s voice when he says “We’re playing catch!” was adorable.
My big boss air fryer stopped working so its nice to see what i could have done
I was waiting for him to pull a sprite out of the dry ice. Lol
The world is an air fryer, cook chow mein
Now stop the boiler, turn down the flames
So try some cutlets and carrots strained
Your food desire will never be the same


-The Wrapping Dumplings
Skillet with Battered Fried Wings
That's no a nice air frier. Use the LG Air friers they r really good
He really walked past the camera got the fryer and didn’t even say hi disappointed in him....😂
Is this not just a glorified fan oven?
4:17 "ooh that's hot"
Lol I have the same air fryer
13:18 "The world is an air fryer"     I love that Smashing Pumpkins song!
Plz plz plz
Most air fryers I e seen don’t look anything like this and top out at 400 degrees.
4:30 is F#4.
My chef always told me “Air frying is an abomination of God”
Durshnaw?
Iron man dies
Finally
Air fryer??? So it is basically just a convection oven???
"Dad, what are you doing?
"Just watching two grown men put on wet warm socks..."
That Tom Brady comment had me dying. And I'm a Pats fan.
I've been wondering since the smoshcast they were on when they would air fry shoes, guess this was the episode.
The new Mythical Beast shirt is giving me Cloak vibes
Way too much plot armor in this episode
How about LTAT becomes daily and Rhett and Link go away till Saturday...
Bad title that isn't an air fryer it's a convection oven.
Nobody gonna mention how casualy Rhett talked about peeing on himself?
Rhett: “You are a man who drank cat urine water.”

Link: “It was cat feces.”

Lol get it right Rhett!!
Feels like the good old days...Rhett's disecting hatchimals and Link keeps touching the hot plate
8:12 "Are You Sure About That"
Dry ice? More like fry ice
The world is an air fryer
Actually Rhett, you supported the Patriots’ case. By heating it and proving hot air expands the ball you also show that colder air will result in the opposite.
14:10 - 14:14 Link is adorable 😊
Air Fryer??? AIR FRYER? So it's an Oven with steam....you 'muricans can't just have normal things, don't you
Uhm in Philippines that is mostly used to make rotisserie chicken and that is called a Turbo in the Philippines
3:22 that’s what she said
3:22 that’s what she said
hey do you think rhett and link know that mine's = mine is and you don't have to say "mine's are already cold", just "mine's cold" or "mine are cold"?
14:27 - Also because of her chest inflatables...
so this is what they're talking about in SmoshCast 🤔
Can't let my granddaughter watch this. She'll cry about the hatchimal!
4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 4:18 




Make it blue if you get the joke 😂
Jokes on you Link, I smell terrible.
This episode gave away far too much of how fake it is. Don't get too carried away now
2:00 Get ready to see this in a link clomsy compilation...
Already gagging lol
The hatchimal ones was stupid but Link burning himself made the entire segment worth it
Socks... Lol
He likes it C H U N K Y
that's not an air fryer. that's a convection oven. Difference is an air fryer circulates air better and truly replicates a fried texture whereas a convection oven is more or less a small oven that mostly crisps up the top only.
Something your mouth hasn't seen before...
why is there no will it cheesecake
OOOOHHHH AHHHHH WAAAAAA MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm
NO DONT
Too bad the air fried shoe didn’t make it into the video
3:21 that’s what she said
Cool..
It’s soo good
Thank you for the ace ventura reference
There are at least three memorable moments in this episode, love it😂😂
4:18 “Uhh thats hot” 😂
It was really hard to look at the cheese wine 🤣🤣🤣
i loled when they kept clicking the wine glasses together
4:17 will smith approves
I could watch them dink their wine glasses for the whole 15 minutes
"mines are already cold" rhett mclaughlin
Unskippable ads now....boo !
This episode was very underwhelming.
Why do I wanna be put in an air fryer?
Are you guys still having those safety meeting? I was so scared for Link all through this ep!
Thanks guys, I really needed a good laugh after a hard day.
I expected a bigger hatchimal
“Because of all the salt”
I’m not so sure that’s an air fryer.....
WHIT WHAT IV HAD ONE FOR 5 YEARS AND NEVER KNEW 😲
Who cares about hatchables! Give us pizza!
isnt air fryer just a fancy name for a convection oven ?
Why would you get the socks wet? You don't need them wet to warm up...
"NO DON'T!" - Link's reaction was amazing!
pleaseee have key and peele next, the chemistry of you two plus them is <3
Does anyone else notifications not working right? Today I got notified for Saturdays and not today's. It's always couple days later I get notified on any channel.
Errr, that's not an air-fryer, that's a Halogen oven...
4:16  will smith
Huh!  These cookers were a big deal when we moved to Thailand in 2011.  They didn’t work very well at the time and gave way when countertop ovens became more affordable.  Interesting to hear that they’re a big thing back in the States.
earlyyy
Football will go back to deflated though once the air cools down
What else do you do with hot socks right after they come out of the dryer Rhett? Hmmmmm?!?!?
Is it not just a small oven
Is that a huge Rhett and a mini wine bottle or a mini Rhett and a regular wine bottle??
It is not a Hatchamal !!!!!! IT IS A HATCHAMAL CALAGGABALS.  DON’T LISTEN TO MY SPELLING.  JUST GET THE POINT.   P.S it is not a hate comment I promise.
Krishna makes me feel funny...like when we climbed the ropes in gym class
Hey
The football has Ebola after entering the hot zone.
Hi
9:47
Can you guys do an episode were Chase marries me please?
So this is what YouTube puts on the trending....
Can we get a will it cotton candy please??
The glare on Rhett’s shirt for a minute made it look like it said “thic”. It’s too early for this. 
Good MyTHICal Morning!
That was Tom Brady's favorite football! Lol
On my way to band class today, I'm gonna' yell down the hall, " Always Balance the Cheese!"
Link's face when he says "but you don't" is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
I use my air fryer as a way to reheat fries. Tastes better that way and I highly recommend it
Can you slow cook some stuff :P
love you guys, you're the best
480 degrees....reminds me of "but it goes to 11".
I can already see Rhett looking into the camera during the sock one in a compilation I'll watch in a couple weeks lol
Nice wine glass dink
Thanks for inspiring me to start doing Youtube!
Give the idiots there tongs and forceps
I like em chunky
Well this was a really dull episode. I don’t know why anyone thought this would be entertaining
So Kevin with hot socks idea... it works well with all cloths, but wether we thought of it on our own or not... it’s still from a Seinfeld episode called “The Calzone” I believe... and now no one can take credit for that idea, except Kramer lol.   Hilarious episode if you haven’t seen it, on Hulu
Wait... hate to crash your party.... but that’s not an air fryer. Sorry. 😬
Now they’re going to get gmm wine glasses so they can just dink it and sink it with wine glasses each time.
Likk is a big idiot sometimes for a man in his 40’s lol
Am I the only one that cringed every time that Rhett called it steam and not gas? #nerdyscience
That room now has 3 times as much carbon dioxide. YAAAAAAAAAAY. Desublimination.
4:33 Somebody GIF this...NOW.🥂
Just letting everyone know that Stevie is beautiful
Who else thought it said "Air Freshener"
I was hoping to see an air fryer being used but all i got was a Halogen convection countertop oven.  Close but they really do cook in very different ways.  Yes the clear glass and the halogen light on top did make for a good viewing effect but it was not air frying.
Wow u found this comment
I hope MBMBAM sees this as a reason for hot grapes. Because hot grapes.
So much air.
They obviously don't care about the product lol,its still great because they'll make sponsorship fun ig

4:17 Will Smith
I don't get why Americans call it an air fryer, or why they describe it as 'frying' things, when it seems incredibly obvious that it's an oven.
Why didn’t Link set it to 480 for the dry ice? haha but awesome video guys!!
That chunky whine looks like my sick
Link is so dumb it hurts......
Whoa
I’ll lay 10-1 they’re  back to eating stuff tomorrow.
They got hot grapes. Call the McElroys!
Best yter ever
You guys should try juicing weird things! If you haven’t already..
so cool
"I feel like Bill Nye" 


You mean you feel like an engineer?
No ive never air fried dry ice but thanks for asking!
Links face though when Rhett screams "Don't" 😅
I knew air was good for something!
I’m dying at Rhett “SHAR-KOOT-ERR-EEE”
Whenever Link tries to be quick about something he looks like a spazz
First Ceasarian on GMM!
I thought it said air freshener
Idk why the food ones are so hard for me to watch when I first wake up in the morn. Just no
Link's smile at 14:14 💕
theres no alcohol left in that wine.
4:30 you guys are so easily entertained
Do the difference between air fried foods and just fried foods
i have used on to do blueberry muffins and banana bread
8:06 Oh my Rhett
3:21 😏😏😏
you're truly excellent, thanks u so much for showing! I uncovered an easier way as you see here mysuccess.live?589 to make money from your house
What a waste of a beautiful cheese plate!
Am I the only one missing the "Link's Glasses" skit. Or is that mainly for "The Shelf that we leave things on"?
pretty sure that over the seasons, these guys are immune to disgusting things
Yall should age stuff in a barrel. I age my whiskey at home in a barrel and it completely changes the flavor of it!
The Easter octave is over! Alleluia
I cringe everytime time they bang a spoon or knife against the glass and bowls, waiting for it to break one episode.
I've never even heard of an Air Fryer!
Controversial opinion: Putting Things In Things > Will It
It’s my birthday 👍🏼
I love Apostle Red. Not a sponsor.
I have an air fryer because it’s “ healthy”. Definitely not because everybody else I know has one.
Did they get the football from the Patriots?
Gosh the amount of anxiety I had over them touching trying to touch the hot things, and then Link burned his hand on the plate lol
I'm confused. Is that not a convection oven? Aren't they different?
I’m not getting this goofy thing
HOT GRAPES!
But... but... but.... but where was the Links glasses test?
I’m from Jordan too
This episode was boring . All the items were uninteresting and nothing exciting really happened .
The cheese and wine would have been delicious to cook some meat in it.
Today I wake up on my day of birth and turn on GMM . Can’t find a better way to spend my morning and kick off my birthday! ☺️
Best dink(s)
good morning
" the meat got a little hard "

McDonalds: Would you like French Fried with that?

Me: I would like some seasoned Mythical Fries

McDonalds: We’re out of Dry Ice, sorry
Air fryer made the most succulent moist chicken breast 🤤🤤🤤 people who say it dries food out are just overcooking it to all hell
So the earth is the air fried machine

And the South Pole is the dry ice
ITS ME BIRTHDAY!! oh and love ur chanle
14:12 but you don’t ❤️
Am i the only one laughing at the "that's hot" part :D 4:18
They sold me on the tongs
Anyone know what brand of air fryer that is? I can't quite see it.
OOh supes interesting
So this was the episode that smosh was taking about
9:08 people with foot fetish is happy asf 😂
8:10 I feel like link caught that but chose to ignore it
5:45 HOLD ON IS THAT A SPECIAL EGG THING
Do "does it air fry?"
It’s funny because I’m watching this in the morning
U guys need to get Tom holand or spider on the show
Its legit just a portabel oven 😂 they’re just Baking stuffIts legit just a portabel oven 😂 they’re just Baking stuff
I like my own comment because know body will like it
This made me nauseous. You guys are sick. Ewwww. How did you DRINK that?
4:35 GMM.Exe has stopped working, press any key to continue.
It’s kinda crazy how many different intros they’ve had over the years
I wish someone could actually explain what happened with the dry ice
Putting weird things in a Pressure Cooker (maybe a bit dangerous) also Microwave! :)
I like it when you do science on the show.
Dont confuse your corn on the cob for your honey 😂
Google search: How does an Air Fryer works?
I need a gif of Rhett and link toasting their wine glasses.
Y’all have clearly run out of ideas
10:36 Football donated by Bill Belichick
9:44 link is such a dork
So this is what Ian was talking about.
Rhett's smile is so cute😂
Rhett got Link good.
13:43 No Link!!! Don't take the lid off!!
So, what exactly is the point with an air fryer? :o
2:43 I SAW YOU LINK
It’s also easy to float down here.   We all float down here.
Dry ice isn’t water it’s actually frozen gas
I think these things can make food more crispy and taste better than normal(oven or stove) but ha guess what it's a small oven not a air fryer note this is the first time I seen a air fryers that uses liquid like this one
Rhett and Link breaking out into a "what" battle for 5 minutes is a perfect example of great friendship.
Please, Show us a montage of how you guys make Rhett and Link pose for the pictures for the thumbnails! Lol
How josh's interview probably went

Josh "i think bad food is as good as good food"
R&L "when can you start"
I get the whole pat and chase thing was a joke and I know it wasn’t for real but it made me feel so sad for chase I felt awful lol
I can sniff another youresoloud compilation already
Best LTAT so far. Intro was my favorite one so far. It had some food with Josh. The clip with Chase and Pat was hilarious. And who doesn't love hearing Rhett and Link sing awkwardly without music? Well done folks. 👏👏👏
I know that was a skit but I was over here feeling so genuinely bad for Chase lmaoo
WHERE WAS THE DOUBLE DIP ???? did you appologize to LINK??
Rhett: “there is a height requirement”




Chase: 
Wow that birthday visit segment felt like an episode from The Office
Josh being excited by bad food is exactly why he's the gmm chef
"You're gonna bust an udder Rhett"
😄
Chase at 11:35 omg the sweet boi
10/10 acting
"Never in my life have i ever wanted to type ducking", i felt that one.
I wish my stomach would be blessed by josh's cooking just once
Makes me happy that people are getting more and more into LTAT. I remember the first few episodes when people were lukewarm about it but now, people are actually looking forward to it within the week now. Proud mb.
I'm just in awe at how well Rhett and Link sing with no accompaniment. You guys are awesome!
I like how Link was just completely focused on his work while these guys were just using a hoverboard and teleporting.
Mythical chef Josh feels passionate about everything he cooks
Whoa that balcony is where everyone was watching the hypnotist
I really want a single uncut episode, no censor, apeshit gmm episode lmfao
I felt so sad and uncomfortable watching Chase be left out. It was funny but I kind of hated it.
For the longest time I thought the singing intros were recorded separately lol
“Git urself a milk maid boah” -Link Neal 2k19
The singing without music is my favorite part!
They didn’t show link give chase his present 🎁 or did I miss something? 🤔
Yea this is cool but don't let this distract you from the fact that Mr.Krabs sold SpongeBob's soul for 62cents
They're so tall that the camera can't even film above their heads
I love how you see everybody thinking about their first bite and then you see Rhett shove the 2nd third of the vomit burrito down his gullet
Someone needs to finish Link’s “Another one!” by saying “DJ KHALED!”
Please have Mathias come onto gmm or go do stuff with him on his channels that would be a mega collab yer both my favourite youtubers
I know the “hey now” is an all star reference but I sang THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF Every. Single. Time 😂
The singing without music is always my favorite part!
Hahaha “yeah that whole height thing was bullsh*t”
“Something wrong with one of your disks” got me good.
I love how they relentlessly bully chase 






Chase we love u 💞🤠
Watch out Ellie! I think Rhett has a man-crush on your man. 😂
rhett and link soundcloud rappers up and coming 2020🙏🏼
watching rhett and link sing those game intros is my favorite content this channel has ever produced
"WHAT?" - Rhett and Link, 2019
Every second of visiting Rhett's office was giving me massive second hand embarrassment. The awkward was over powering. But I did love it. The whole episode was great.
GMM: releases this vid
youresoloud: It's free real estate
Lol “never in my life have I meant to type ducking”
Today’s LTAT was hilarious! Btw I love Jade’s reaction to Link singing in her face 😂
I love that they’re from NC it makes me feel like I have a chance😂
Am I the only one who absolutely LOVES Rhett's and Link's entrances.
Im still on the "what" and i already know this is gonna be a good LTAT
Feel so bad for Chase lol 🤣 Hope they make it up to him.
The entrance. Epic.
Rhett- : Cocktails woo"  
Me- DUCK NAILS WOOHHOOO - Simply XD
Is it just me or is my favorite part when the people react to them singing the title segment
Is anyone else cringing at the first clip lol? Still loved it though.
Alternate title: Link saying "Another one" for 25 minutes straight
Rhett and link at the beginning were like the "Mine" birds from Finding Nemo but they said "What" instead
I think that What Battle was my favorite walk in so far.
Pat is so charismatic! So impressive he can just walk into his girlfriends workplace and be so dynamic with her boss!
I would love maybe like one Saturday a month where Emily and Jordan co-host LTAT. They are really funny together
Cmon why you gotta do Chase like that? 😕He is amazing and deserved more guys. Respect him sometimes 😑❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anutha one! Of these awsome videos omg I love LTAT.
what did chase ever do to you
Love you guys and all the hard work you put into everything! Thank you so much!!!
i love how your office looks. It gives off a warm and welcoming feeling
I think Rhett and Link should do a guest appearance on Whose Line Is It Anyway...
and vice versa... Invite Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, Aisha Tyler & Ryan Stiles & the others to GMM.
Rhett gives the sweetest smile at 0:35
 
It really shows how goofy their friendship is. ❤️
What a special thing it must be to be around Rhett and Link when they start being their spontaneous selves.
3:20 haha Rhett Farted!
15:16 Omg! That was Chase's ability! Pat wanted to play the piano! 😂😂😂
I loved the one person clapping after the whats
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Pat!!! What?! Lol!!!! 
Ps- everything about this LTAT 👏💕
'You don't pump the pump unless the pump is primed."

- Link
The video hasn't even reached the 1 minute mark, and the word "what" has already been said over 50 times. Now this is quality content.
These weird things they keep doing 😂 
Kind of secretly hoping they’re actually working on Buddy System 3 and those weird moments are going to tie in somehow. Probably not but I can dream!
I'm questioning whether I question all advice right now...🤔
The Chase, Pat, and Rhett bit is hilarious.
Link has multiple Keith Haring shirts? Props, my guy. Keith Haring is my favorite artist.
They are such man children... in the best way possible 💀
okay so is no one going to mention that we've already seen 20:06 in the first awkward singing compilation? no? am i one too obsessed mythical beast?


ok.
Do the entire I'm An Oil Man speech from There Will Be Blood for the intro
Also 21:59 side note: Rhetts arm movements (dance??) Made me choke on my water 😂💧🙊
I just love everything about this show. LTAT for lyfe!
I think I might know what happened with the oranges and Rhett’s brother! 

It’s called a “margarita burn” and usually happens with limes or lemons but all citrus can cause this 

Basically if you get citrus acid on your skin while in direct sunlight or on sunburnt skin it can cause a severe chemical reaction that burns the skin worse than just a regular sunburn! 

It’s because citrus acids contain photosensitizers, a chemical compound that basically “speeds up” a sunburn

It can be seriously bad actually and is a good reason to not eat or touch citrus while in direct sunlight!
This is one of my fave episodes of anything, ever! SO hilarious!
Barbara and Jade's ears were the best. I always imagine what the guests think when you bust out into song.
The shirt said it's better than Chase's office 🤣
I love Link singing Britney Spear's " Baby One More Time"
Can’t wait for youresoloud’s take on this.
Well then.... that intro is just too funny😂🤣
Somewhere, without a doubt, there is a fan with fanfic that was nearly realized in the first few mins of this video.
"All advice should be questioned" 
Why?
Thinking back on how much I loved seeing them individually singing, i wouldn’t mind seeing the guys singing the bit here and there😂
why they being so nasty to link these days!
That office skit was so funny y’all. Good work to whoever helped out with that!
This was my fave LTAT. It was just filled with charm and udderly sweet moment.
Every mornin', I grab my donut and coffee and I
Sit down at my screen (plasma screen)
Nothing gets me going like the possibility of knowing
That Rhett & Link will have some funny ass shenanigans waiting for me.
Wow I was expecting them to start making out passionately at the beginning
Ellies bf and chase need their own segment.. poor chase
I love the song compilation! Just absolutely incredible! 😂
One of the best LTATs ever 😂 here again rewatching it two days later
Can y'all bring LDShadowLady or Stacyplays on I really love it when y'all bring people on and I think it would be cool if they were on the show
I bet the loft is filled with past employees 👀 mike is up there.
"It's like your about to crap something demonic."
😂😂
Link rocking the Keith Haring shirt😍😍
Ugh I get so excited when Chase is going to be Im an episode. And Rhett just ignored him the whole time -.- MORE CHASE MORE CHASE
I think Rhett is cheating on Link with Ellie’s boyfriend. 😂😂
Link should of yelled out obnoxiously and randomly, ITS RAINING TACOS!! 😂
How many times did Link day “another one” in this video I couldn’t stop laughing
This entire episode it yes

💜from SATX
Legends say they continue saying "what" until they died
Every "anotha one" WAS funnier Link, I promise.
I'm actually laughing so hard at the threatening "what" scenario that just went down
I liked this episode so much I had to watch it twice 😄😄
The Ducktales one was so good lol
Office skit litterally my childhood for about 80% of it any way.
Rhett eats half of the burrito in one bite
“I kinda like it”
Agrees that it tastes a little bit like vomit
Proceeds to eat it
Is he just a hungry man or is he not fed in his house?
Leaving a like solely because of Rhett and Link’s intro 😂
Best freaking flap jacking intro ever!!!! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!
She was so fed up with them😂😂
18:07 Yes, I love these compilations!
Lol WHAT was that intro? Lol I love all of you guys.
Rhett: What?
Link: What?
x4
Me: :)
I like that you changed the title from Rhett and Link Sing Pt. 2
Was fully expecting a kiss in the intro
Looks like people fighting at H&M
The intro sounds like every football game ever 😆
"You just gotta microwave it... cause  you want that hot lettuce"


no one ever.
"All advice should be questioned." Link that is some wise advice! 😁
The loft is obviously where Damnyell stays...
That whole AirBnB thing got super meta for a minute.
For some reason, I want to hear Link sing more Britney Spears 🤔
So no one caught unto the ducking part😂😂
Link: won’t you plaaay with me?
Rhett: smirks

Omg hahahaha
Bring back that Damnyell sweatshirt and take my money 💛💛💛
"I love warm lettuce" YOU ARE BANNED FROM THE McDLT! (The beef stays hot! The cool stays crisp!)
Bravo, bravo, fantastical lovely performance
OMG A Chicken Caesar Burrito?!
I like that their heads we're completely cut off in the beginning 😂
Watch Avengers: Endgame now and GMM on weekday mornings(watch Avengers: Endgame though. It's beautiful). You'll be an allstar if you do.
Stevie's hair is beautiful today.
was this titled “rhett and link singing with music part 2” before, or am I just on crack
Nice shoutout for Greensboro -- my grandparents lived in High Point and Greensboro
You guys should try out that new intro you put together a few episodes ago
( ¡dalè! )

whatever it was, i hope chase's actual birthday was the complete opposite of what was depicted on this episode!

it was a treat to hear all those a capellas!
and to see more of link's clear frames!
i'd try it myself, but i know that style is not compatible with my mug

so . . .
. . . 
youresoloud should make a compilation of all of rhett’s dead eyed laughs
peep 6:02
I already know it's going to be a good episode just from looking at the title, Rhett & Link singing >
PAT!!! LMAOOO!! I've lost it! xD
Josh: I think I’m showing crack...
Stevie: Let me see!
The singing without music is so good with the guests
CONGRATULATIONS THIS WAS TRULY AN INCREDIBLE LTAT 🤣🤣🤣💖💖💖
I am compelled to wonder...how does Ellie feel about the intense PATsion radiating from Rhett??? 🤔🤔🤔
nobody wants to type "ducking" stupid auto correct.
I always wondered how they recorded the songs 😂
Pat’s cool. Charismatic, and he gives off Jake Gyllenhaal vibes. Keep him around.
The beginning is always gold. As demosnated escpecially in this episode
As another LTAT segment you could react to compilations fans have made of gmm, like yoursoloud!
Gotta love how quickly they synced up the "What!?"
"All advice should be questioned" Are you sure about that Link?
Play the intro at 2x speed
I'm not a fan of christmas music, but I kind of want the Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-balls as a ringtone LOL
someone please explain why link kept saying another one im crying
Just listened to supershigi do a mood flipped all star.  She just posted it on her channel. I was weirded out that you started talking about it. 🤣 (Supershigi sung "to the moon" and finding paradise "wish my life away" also Deltarunes end credits song.  She has an amazing voice and needs more recognition
19:40 she is totally into Rhett
Best intro ever.You two are like those MINE seagulls but better LOL 
😂😂I was expecting a car not the guy to carry/drag them 😂😂
I love the guest's reactions to you guys singing the intros lol
Best part was the singing 🎤
Ducking is one of those low key inappropriate references that I love
The last minute or so was... interesting. I've learned a lot about the kind of person Link's Grandfather was. Lol!
Love the show about the show God bless you guys
rhett: "this tastes a little like vomit"
also rhett: /takes jaw-unhinging bite/
Y'all are so insanely talented!!!!
Yooo what up from gboro. lol
The ones with the guests are hilarious. They're just standing there quiet waiting to laugh
In China lettuce is usually consumed warm/cooked
Really love you guys singing! :D
The best is when link is singing about baby products 😂
This episode was funny af
I freaking hate when autocorrect changes the F-word to ducking
That hand slap at 11:47 has got to be one of the funniest and greatest things i’ve seen on gmm
Please read..    MGM please open a restaurant, so josh can make us all of these magical dishes 😃
OMG my prayers have been answered
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Rhett and link: WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT
Fun fact: my grandma grew up on a farm and later became a masseuse
Favorite intro so far 😂😂😂
So glad Rhett and Pat were finally reunited.
The singing comp starts at 18:00
You should do a salad dressing showdown! 
May the best dressing win 🥗🏆
I actually felt bad about Chase. I just want to give him a cuddle
It’s so funny to see their height difference when they play fight in the beginning of the episode. Made my day!
Original Grilled Stuft Burrito was best Grilled Stuft Burrito
omg i remember that burrito.  holy hell they REALLY need to bring that back STAT
I'd of been Link in this situation. Just minding my own business and giving people looks when they get near me.
I had been wondering about those theme songs just this past week! The compilation was a nice surprise! I really enjoyed the guest reactions.
That lonesome clap after them repeatedly saying "WHAT?!" to each other was priceless
Link, you never disappoint! 😂
The "balls"-song was so good, made it into both compilations. #truedat
youresoloud has been summoned
Up next: Rhett and Link screaming "what" for 10 hours
idk why but this makes me want to see rhett and link as goths
What happens if you got stuck in the Taco Bell bathroom 








I made a video on that so check it out
WHAT?! 😂😂 
My cheeks hurt from laughing 😂 
The way Link just did the description of milking.....OMG my mind is in the gutter 😂😂
Have a great weekend Mythical Beasts 🐮🐄
😍that picture of Elvis on the wall😍
Josh says: umm I want that one.🤣
Link abused on camera bois. This is history!!!!!
5:51 Stevie...? What is happening in this episode hahahaha
Bingewatch Rhett & Link, and every time it feels like they're about to kiss, take a shot. WHAT? WHAT!?!? WHAT?!
This was a GREAT one! I thoroughly enjoy the no-post footage of Rhett & Link singing. Two very talented gentlemen!
Do a rhett conspiracy theory
“Get yourself a milk man, boy!“ - Link 2k19
ninja ruinned this entire video by showing up
Rhett and link singing with no music part 2
Funniest intro ever!!!!!!
"Feels extremely passionate-ly?" - Link
YES!!!! That was my burrito. I loved that thang.
Epic rap battle of manliness
Stevie is truly one of a kind in the best way
This show always makes me laugh and it's greatly appreciated. My heart is very happy
Does Link really not understand what it means when a man gets milked?? LmFao‼
0:24 OK, we have a Zax situation developing here...
yoursoloud has entered the chat.
I know it was just a bit but I couldn’t help feeling a little bad for chase😂😂
Could you guys do an episode where you react to youresoloud videos
I love how sometime Stevie is just like huh? towards Rhett. I feel that is a daily occurrence.
The last segment was actually pretty interesting. I thought that was all done in post to keep tempo. 🤓
I thought it was a little odd when they played All-Star in Avengers: Endgame.
Hey i think it would be fun to make the guys react to compilations of them (haven’t seen before)
Love the second stream on
F O S H O 🤦🏻‍♂️
I could watch hours of R&L singing no-music no-graphics titles! :D
It's musical genius!
LLTAT Love Lets Talk About That
idk why, but ive always seen the way they treat Chase a bit off.. not only in this video, but in some other videos which has Chase in it. if i were him, i'd be feeling so offended :( somehow it breaks my heart </3 because man,, it's embarrassing and impolite at the same time :/
Im offended for Chase who is my fav crew member. He is waaaaay great and cool enough for the loft.  Also it was his birthday!  May have to switch to team link.
Who else was here before they changed the title?
21:31 Jade looks deathly terrified.
They really need to make the camera a little higher when they come in lol
Rhett is looking extra daddy today 😳
After watching this it has become a good mythical morning.
That entrance was pure toxic masculinity.
Y'all intro had me LOL!!!  "WHAT"
The intr and then the hilarious skit of the trip to Rhett's office was GOLD!
Literally THE BEST Taco Bell item EVER!
Omg I know it’s all scripted but the office visit sketch made me feel so bad for Chase 😭 lmao. He plays wounded but appreciative so well.
At first it looked like Rhett had a small container of bacon bits next to his cup🤣
Stevie is so damn cute
Gorgeous girl
"Walkin' On the Sun" > "All-Star
idk what's better - the singing itself, or the guests' reactions, or the stuff ups
Stevie!!! Whatever u did with ur hair and makeup keep doing it....today ur pretty hot
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD WAS GONNA ROLL ME
Shout out to napkin guy
And another one!  😂 Had me rolling every time.
no one:
link: anOther oNe
0:20-1:03 every Highschool fight ever...
That glass case coffee/display table makes me so nervous.
Can you make another episode of Shipfaced please
OMG LINK!!!!! THAT WAS THE EXACT SNACK I HAD AT THE ONLY SOCCER GAME I EVER PLAYED IN!!!!






("Sliced oranges with a Caprisun")
How does Rhett stay so thin!?  He eats so much... SO MUCH!  He will eat anything.
I always followed up soccer with soda!  I think about our whole team did!
Stevie said “Chase won a trip to Rhett’s office” 🤔
Omg ! What am I even watching !! Poor chase by the way! Reminded myself of me !
i feel like there is a sort of tension btw the staff and link just saying 😂😂
That moment you realize you’re old. Josh was in 5th grade when I was in my second year of working. Lol
As someone who doesn’t always like their red hair, it’s nice to see people that have it and look so good and confident. Love this show.
link i understand what was happening in the video. i appreciate you even if these jerks want to make you seem small.
Happy Cotton Candy Day, Daddies. Gotta Gif 24:44.
Omg I remember that sauce!! I loved it.
wouldn't mind more Josh
But chase has already won a trip up to the loft, for the snack bracket 🤔
Everyone deserves awards for dealing with Link
rhett and link's best friend energy is so raw it's fused into sibling energy, and it's never been more vividly encompassed by a) the exercise couch attack incident and b) WHAT
Crazy I was here before the notification popped up on the top of my screen
What?! 🤨🤣
The first minute....i had a dream like this once
Stream on Stream on Stream on till  your dreams come  true!!!!
That chase clip was so god dang funny! I laughed so hard😂
Ellie you better look out babe, cos I think Rhett is stanning your man!
no one:
rhett and link: hwoT hWoT hWOt HwOT
Ellie’s boyfriend 😍
I say Josh is my fav GMM crew. He's got good wit and timing.
That beginning was hilarious! Stevie's face 😂😂👍
Since they are coming to California soon, GMM should try and get twenty one pilots on the show.
Might be the best intro ever. WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!
even better than the last one!! i love it
nothing makes my cheeks hurt from smiling more than the Singing with No Music segment. I thank you
You should do a “Will it truffle” episode 😁
Link "mouth moves faster than his brain" Neal
Why did Link turn into DJ Khaled...?
The singing was amazing.  Multiple snort laughs.  😂😂😂
Link looks small standing next to Rhett but still they are both so tall the camera can't see their faces...
The Caesar chicken wrap was my favorite was so sad when it left the menu!!
Stevie's hair looks really good today.
Now I'll just imagine Rhett and Link being DORKS while singing
Hi Rhett, Link and crew! I have been watching your channel for the last 4 years and have thoroughly enjoyed it. You guys are always so entertaining and hillarious and always brighten my day. Sometimes when I am upset or miserable GMM is my go-to thing to make me smile and let the light inside shine from within. You awesome people are so incredible and I hope everyone has a brilliant week. All of you are so ridiculous and humorous and your videos never disappoint. Anyone who dislikes these videos are psychos! Lots of love from Australia xx
Yoursoloud is ready for war.
Office tours are just the right amount of uncomfortable to help me through my day
I miss the Chicken Ceaser Pita from Wendy's. Now that was good.
Imagine if LTAT was hosted by Mustached Josh
Remake the Unicorn Rap
I always wanted to see them singing😂
Rhett in the background learning the teleport handshake was too much!!😂😅 And the end 😂😅😂😅😂😅 I'm on the floor 😂😅😂😅🤣
"The thing is, is that..." Rhett 2019
Chase is my absolute favorite.
“Get yourself a” waifu
That opening was extremely Eric Andre. I dig.
i love links expression after pat ran into his chair.
Rhett and pat are relationship goals
Josh is one of the best things that has happened to GMM, please never let him go.
For a fan a trip to Rhett's office would actually be really cool
0:45   it’s been 45 seconds and i already can’t breath🤣🤣😭😭
Have a good mythical saturday morning everyone☀️
Mythicality to you from South Korea🗻
Pleaseeeee do a video with Molly Burke!!
0:30
Internal screaming intensifies
Rhett and link jamming to lil john before the show
Rhett and links entrance was the best ever 😂.
The smothered burrito was 🔥🔥
Josh i feel ya about the chicken caesar burrito!!! I was so upset when they discontinued it!
Chase is too cute it hurts my heart.
They need to put intros into this thing before each section like Dude Perfect Overtime
rhett & link at the beginning of the show reminded me of those heads that bounce up and down in the movie spirited away
Best opener yet 😂😂
I love the music free Rhett and Link singing compilations! One of the best things born from GMM ever!
Stop laughing Stevie. I'm already inlove with you.
Who needs notified when you're up at 5am for work. 🙃
I love the reactions from the guests, especially now that I know they don't know what the songs are for lol
I thought the balls one was done last time
i heard the intro without seeing it because i was getting ready for the day and i literally could not stop laughing. why did they do that? 😂😂
Video name change
Nascar is low stakes comparatively
I never knew how much I needed Rhett and link singing without music in my life until it was given to me. Thank you
What..what...what....

Ahhhh..the prefight playground ritual of the 70' s and 80' s student.  At my school they did this while shoulder to shoulder as they slowly spun in a circle.
Woah! I have that same wes Anderson book!
Link is like rivers cuomo from Weezer
’’Dude,you got yours in a cup thats so sick."' lmao he needs to be on again
idk why i almost like ltat more than gmm
LTAT is the best part of my Saturdays!
Have Rhett's brother on the show!!
NEW INTERNATIONAL TASTE TEST IDEA! What about chips from different countries?
You should make a song about mowing the lawn
And you peeps are awesome awesome thanks for making the world happier and funnier with your videos
We needed video of Link double dipping that ice cream spoon!! Lol
"What... What... What"
I love that this episode went off the rails and everyone was like “This is my life now”
Thank you for making go on a Smash Mouth binge...I feel really old realizing what year All Star came out
also best intro to any of these episodes
I liked these intros a lit better
YAY I've been waiting for another "singing titles without music" segment!! (I have to be that person tho, and point out that the "fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-balls" was already in the last one!)
I'm genuinely concerned about the vein in Josh's neck.
another one!!
Tag yourself! I'm chase.
Legend has it that if you're really quiet, you can still hear a "what" whiring around.
That lonely clapping after the "what" battle cracked me up.
The part two of singing titles is amazing. Please give us part three!
They
 said what for a good 40 seconds
"I'm hot lettuce all the way"
I love Link's Keith Haring shirt
sweet napkin game bro
Omg i loved the singing. You guys are awesome
Rhett: always "busy"
Everyone's just waiting for the yoursoloud clapback
Man, Josh is so nice
Love GMM so much more since LTAT
Ducking?
Let’s talk about that
Josh is so pure.
The Battle of What
"In 2003 I was in fifth grade" Wow I'm old...
20:21 when your crush says hi
They stole the knobbleberry joke
14:00 chase has already been up there in an episode
Chase is so adorable 😫💕
I love how Rhett man handled Link lol
Singing at their desk was my favorite part!!!
Can you do an episode with Eminem?
Lol they were worried about demonetization at the beginning with all star but then ... the end 😄
Emd guna get all their ad rev
5:08 - Just have to say that napkin wrangler was on point
I feel like this show is evolving into a version of The Eric Andre Show, and I'm on board with it!
Seeing Lennon be the one surprised by impromptu singing is very special to me.
Josh is precious. and Rhett's bromance with Pat is fantastic.
21:47 thanks me later ;)
Y’all should do a boot scoot boogie game 😂
There were some genuinely awkward moments in this LTAT
Link saying "another one" over and over again somehow never stopped being hilarious to me
if pat talked with a british accent  he would be gav from slow mo guys
Rhet and Link's enterance is always one of the best parts of the video
Call "youresoloud"
Whenever Rhett and Link curse, it scares me.
R & L: What! What! What!
Me: Kiss Kiss Kiss
Doesn't anyone else feel like when they look at Rhett they think of their drunk uncle lol.
I feel so bad for Chase 😭😭
and suddenly I love Ellie's boyfriend
0:45 Stevie's face is the mood of the year
Pat, the new golden boy 👦
Video was hilarious
*shrug*
I ship it
I wanted to see that HSM inspired one 😂
North Carolina here, we still do that 😂
I love the videos of them singing. So funny 😂
stevie looks so beautiful
wow what an entrance
I feel so bad for Chase now 😭
0:30 when your to talk to fit on screen. 😂🤣
They should add them singing the intro at the end of each gmm episode
She is perfect (I wonder how wonderful she would be with sort hair ..pure perfect?)
5:09 When men's pockets are so big you can fit a whole water bottle in one
STOP CHANGING THE TITLE AND THUMBNAILS!!!!!!!!!
Remember when you reacted to the Me!Me!Me! Video?Ya
Really tho y'all should give him a gift card tho
TIL I'm the same age as Mythical Chef Josh
What what what what what 🗣🤣🤣
You guys gotta make some more Song Biskets
I miss those predictive text bot songs, those were amazing LOL
Them entering the set... 😂😂😂😂😂😂 and Stevie “...what?” 😂
Rhett understands that eating the untasteful food, will grant you one skill into knowledge each time.
Please do more of these scenes. Really loved it.
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME...
Title Change?
"What" just happened LOL
So i start watching and replay the What what 5 times 😂😂😂
I don’t think Link was really talking about a back massage from a milk maiden. 😂
anyone see the video where rhett rages about his chair?
Whut?
Whut?!
Wut
wut
Did the title and thumbnail change on this video?
Hi guys! Love watching your shows!! Thank you for uploading daily
I am a gboro mom the tradition still remains!
in australia mcdonalds has a chicken caeser salad wrap and i think its one of the best things on the menu
Those were my absolute favorite
We NEED a Josh’s recipe book !
THIS IS AMAZINNNN BRUHH
What the heck was that intro I am so confused
Yes link, a milk maiden would give great massages... especially at the end.
I wanna steal links style
....did I miss part 1 of this?!?!
Jade at 21:33 😂😂😂
“WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?!”
ANOTHER ONE!!
DUH!! Lol🤣
Can we just appreciate the way Stevie's hair flows so beautifully? Like every time the camera turns to her I can't help but stare at those flowy gold locks 😂😂😂
OH MAN I LOVE PAT
Was that a shoutout to Greensboro, NC?!? What's up my home townnnnnnnnnnnnn
G! Stevie is so cute
Great episode, had to skip the ninja part tho
I love ducktails!!!
Seized by Julius Caesar would’ve made for a much better commercial
Chase and Link need to form an alliance
A good hand job link lmfao
Rhett and Link's  ears: what what what what what what! My ears: what what WHY what what WHY WHY WHO what what HUAT
WHAT,WHAT,WHAT,WHAT,WHATWHAT,WHAAAAAT!!!!!!!!!
17:40 for the singing
That's sooooo messed up what you did to Chase man lol! Team "Chase is better than Pat" 😝😂!
I still want ltat as the normal show format have a crew member guest each day
I don’t know about anyone else but I jam out to the intros and title graphics.
Many people now have the urge to type "ducking"
CottonCandyRandy Should Have Been In This Video
I couldn't stop smiling and laughing at Pat, he's a superstar
*another one*
Do a will it episode with the la beast. That would be the best
Best ideas ever
The BEST DUET on youtube !!!
:O Never seen link curse before
Rhett And Link sing without music part 2?
I’m with Link I was look8ng for a character Ceasar
Josh has such an amazing backside!  That butt, those thighs!  Damn!  I think I have a bro-crush on Josh!
Hilarious episode !
I love how they treated Chase in this episode even though everyone knows they love Chase lmao.
Youresoloud has entered the chat
Best intro yet.
stevie is one of the most beautiful people in the world inside and out
That last song brought me back, lol
give josh's brows back
best intro ever
Chase's hair game is on point.
Best intro ever
Link and I have the same shirt 😂
Title and thumbnail change
Chase, a man after my own heart, teleportation ALL THE WAY!
Rhett nailed that look of longing whenever he looked at Chase and Pat xD
Justice for chase
Yo early gang where you at???
0:24 When my friends and I start an argument
We need an all Chase episode.
Josh has a nice butt though... was my favorite part of the video
22:00 I looked up the Ducktails theme song after that. One of the best.
Loolll i love this! 💕
New segment idea: Link explains his oddly constructed comments
Stevie could be a model.
What, What, What?! That's how I'm going to greet people from now on ✌
Love that chicken caesar burrito I miss it
5th😂😂😂lol
“Rhett was a trip to chases office” ~Stevie
I love the segments when Pat is around during the LTAT episodes. They're hilarious
WHAT!
Whet?
WHAT!
Awesome reaction from Thomas Lennon, and Link's Sam Smith was more than passable.
Link tries to kill Chase with darts & Rhett just straight up disses him on his birthday 😂 poor Chase though
Petition to give Pat an "Exploring the Mythical Offices" mockumentary show
I love this episode 😂
That what bit sounded EXACTLY like the green heads from spirited away.
This is gonna give yoursoloud that güd editing content
Link doesn't have a monitor.
0:30 must have been the look Stevie made when they had their first fight. 😂😂
17:30 for the featured segment
"Rhett and link without music" was a better title
WHAT?!?! WHAT?!?!? WHAT?!?! WHAT?!?! WHAT?!?!
Josh looks like a Sim
Rhett & Link aggrOTP
0:37 that is when I say 
"JUST KISS ALREADY! " 
LOL
so much sibling banter in this episode
I was waiting for Rhett to do the matrix room when they entered kinda underwhelmed
Let make 10 hour version of Rhett and Link saying What to Eachother
Jen is my spirit animal
I'm honestly happy that I missed the first one of this Rhett Link singing thing.  If I wanted to watch that I'd watch all of the other GMM compilation videos
Lol the trip to Rhett’s office was perfect. Lol
Shutting the door killed me
I was jealous he got to hug Rhett :(
Don't even touch that chicken ceasar  burrito! That's sacred! I remember it and having it multiple times and loving it. It wasn't piping hot, and it was made perfectly balanced lol. (Maybe not perfect but let me pretend). I have mentioned it so many times and no one this far has remembered. Respect for remembering, but disrespect for disrespecting it haha.
Why do they always change the thumbnail lol
I think Ellie might have to be worried about her boss stealing her boyfriend
Just love how linc's hair moves when he's nodding to a song he is singing
Yep, I definitely see why smosh is with them now by that intro 😂😂💕
why do vids keep getting their titles and thumbnails changed ???
My college sells this in one of the pizza places.
Pat kinda looks like Jake Gyllenhaal is that just me
Gotta watch this before going to sleep. #nightowl
WHAT?! one of the best intros ever! xD aw poor chase, I hate how sad he looks when Pat goes into the "secret loft" xc but them cup fruits are pretty good...Link looks annoyed when they run into his chair xD And lastly, their singing is oN POINTTTT
Sometimes I wonder why I have watched Rhett and Link since 2013... that "what gag" when they were coming in may be why I am questioning this...
...and this one time at band camp
Csn yall do Honey comb uncspping plz
A 25 minute video in the morning... Who else is pausing it to watch it later?
Jeez enough with taco bell
0:40 Ok, now kiss 😘
Anyone else picture Stone Cold saying “What”? in the beginning of this vid?
I'm stealing the handshake
I've been waiting the whole day for this! It's already 6:00 PM!
wow stevie your hair is so silky and flowing today!
These guys never fail to put a smile on my face 😊
Not gonna lie Josh's backside is FINE!
Link and Chase should take a trip to Stevie's office or something
Uploaded 3 minutes ago... oh wow... Early
Man, Josh is the best
Ducking , that’s so funny . Protip you can program phone to autocorrect certain words!!
5:10 i thought that was a cop omg
omg josh shaved his 1970s pornstache. thank caesar.
What?????? (Why without music i meant).

I will type for you ducking.
Chase has the cutest baby face 😍
OMG poor Chase :-(
Lmao Waiting for the "Rhett stop being mean to Chase" posts in 3... 2...1
5:23 look at Link
Keep eating the brownies pre show 😂🤣
Stevie love you
0:45 Is this the Erik Andre show?
The title changed, right?
All I can say is "WHAT".
The what challenge
Awww Chase XD
00:35 Me and my best friend fighting
Who’s awake at 5AM then see a notification lmao
It’d be cool for josh to have a cooking show on a Sunday
omg.  I love LTAT.
Totally forgot about the chicken caesar burrito. It was my favorite!!
did they post this on the wrong account ? lol
You could probably find a traditional milk maid on an Amish Farm.
This episode has an Eric andre show vibe and it's fantastic
Wait, so GMM apparently bought Smosh right?
You wouldn't understand it's a bro thing
I love Rhett and Link's friendship
Ducking. Is that how you write it?
YES THANK YOU DUCKING ISNT A THING
12:17 the level of uncomfort in rhetts face is palpable
Good morning from a stormy day in Ireland!!
Relax man.
Shit, I thought they were gonna kiss in the beginning. 😂😂
cheesecake edition
The birthday skit was both hilarious and sad at the same time 😥😂 I’m so glad Chase has stayed with the GMM crew.
Funny thing is this is my favorite fast food item too! I don't think I've ever known anyone that liked the caesar burrito.
I never watched any of the other behind the scenes stuff because I didn’t like it, but I actually enjoy this format
😂🤣😂 Link!! Milk maiden lol! Thanks for a good mythical morning- best way to start the day 😁
i ship chase and pat
Get Gordon Ramsay on the show
Why does rhett and link remind me of ted and marshall from HIMYM
ANOTHER ONEEE!!
Lol 🤣 I thought Link was going to make another dirty joke with his hand gestures! 😜 (get yo mind outta the guttah, bowah)
I'd like to see GMM run 25-30 mins..
Josh is built!
DO THE CHOCO CHALLENGE!
I want to see a full uncut GMM
Why do they keep changing the title and the thumbnail to something less atractive then the first one
So we not doing mustache jokes no more ?
Link, bro, you can't try to be tough when you got both hands covering your crotch and your legs tucked together XD
Should do a Guess this Dust game, with different powdered items in jars. Intro could be "Another one bites the dust"
My notification bell is messed up. Already 91 likes and 54 comments.
F I N A L L Y :D
I totally do like Rhett. This isn’t that great yet I take another bite and finish the food. 😂
I want a single episode where they can talk like they do irl and curse and stuff with no censorship
"WHAT?!"
"What" should be written on  shirts and hats as merch.
as an audiencey person, i feel bad for chase... is that how this is supposed to work?
Link wants to get milked
@19:12 what episode is this?
Smashmouth went to my highschool
And now I is make zee 40 comment of zis vedio
Okay but seized by Caesar would have been funnier if the crew was grabbed by a man dressed as Caesar - I see why Link was lost
Anotha one~
Stevie=wife
They should do a game where they watch a bit of a compilation of themselves and guess the title. Like a few clips from Rhett and link being southern bois and they have to guess
Ooh poor Chase that's so sad 😔
They're stoned...
Its all about the resspecctt...
Wow for some reason, Pat reminds me of a safe for work Geoff Ramsay from Rooster Teeth.
Another one
Jade at 21:32 💀
careful. with how youtube has been lately, i wouldn't be surprised if you got copy striked just for saying "hey now"'
WHAT!?!
lettuce on a burrito should be against the law...all slimy and stringy yuck
DON'T CLICK MORE!




Be safe out there, I've been exposed to spoilers by this method. Stay off YouTube comments for the time being.
Pat is awesome
“Bad food is almost as good as good food.”
-Josh
So we are going to ignore that Link was trying to be DJ Khaled but failed miserably?
Say what again i dare you i double dare you what does Marcellus Wallace look like
Lol those parodies had me dying with laughter
Soooo, is it just me or Rhett looks like he dyed his hair? It looks more chocolate for some reason. It usually perfectly matches his beard hair. Hmm lol
0:25 oh no 😂
WHAT!? WHAT!? WHAT!? WHAT!? WHAT!?WHAT!?WHaaaat WHAaaaaaat?
This is helping me calm my anxiety after feeling an earthquake that was too close for my liking.
I FEEL SO BAD FOR CHASE!!!! It was HIS birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t remember the Pink Floyd one at all. That’s awesome.
I see a bird
A piece of media is a medium
Whos best?


Like : Link


Comment Rhett
She’s from Greensboro! Gboro represent lol
I love warm lettuce

Can we kill the walking in thing before it kills the entire show?
Yoursoloud Stevie is making her move




The battle of Rhett and link compilations has begun... dun dun duuuuuun
What?
 What?
   What?
23:40 Link’s laugh
Loooooved this episode !!!
I need a mythical cookbook
BRING BACK PEWDIEPIE!
Why did I get emotional when pat and Rhett were saying goodbye
Kinda odd that the title is about the snack instead of the main point of the video??? Why are you marketing like this
So goooooood!!! 😹
look at link during the outtro he still dont know his line
anybody else shout at their screen "kiss! kiss! kiss!" in the beginning when they were all up in each others' faces in the beginning?? no? just me? ok then...
Oooooh cup of Noodle.
stevie is so cute
Anyone gotta time stamp
I’m single now, better hit the farms
They changed the title and thumbnail...
Who else on acid
WHAT?!?!
I’m from Goldsboro ❤️
Can someone please make a what counter
Poor chase 🥺
Poor chase 😂
I am starting to get the feeling Link and Rhett need a vacation from each other. I am noticing a lot of tension. 🤨😂
Can’t wait till the yoursoloud edition
what episode is 19:12?
The singing without music shows just how talented these guys really are
I’m with Josh. I loved that Caesar wrap
Amazing singing. We don't neeeeed no, MARINARA.
Another one!!
Oof Chase 😍
boom dislike for ninja
I love the Ellie's Boyfriend Pat bit, he does seem cool! Also the behind the scenes of the music is my fave, so funny.
today i learned i am older than josh and now i am going to have to dig myself a grave
The singing starts at 18:09
Weirdest enterance ever.. lol
He was in Grade 5 in 2003?  Gosh I feel old lol
DJ LINK #WETHEBEST
I'm hot lettuce all the way.
Fight! Fight! Lmao what?
that birthday visiting thing felt like the most planned out and awkward thing I have ever watched out of  LTAT
Happy Birthday Chase
I NEED that Damnyell & Richard sweatshirt. Are you going to make it available at mythical.store?
Bring back the Chicken Cesar stuffed burrito!!!!
We finally got to see Links wifes face.
If they made a album, I would buy it
I love chase so much!!!
What? 🤨
Go to 16:57 rhett says waiched instead of watched😁😂
Poor Chase, I love my nuget son🤗
Rhett really wanted to finish that burrito
11:35 I felt that 😂
Wow.. what?
5:45 Josh appears 😁
So Arbys need to bring back there mushroom and Swiss roast beef sandwich . Has a special sauce and those little crunchy onions . O M G . Don't Flop.
Those "what"s woke my baby up. Smh lol
youresoloud get on this
I remember when this came out, I loved it! I hated when they got rid of it.
Was link's mic off for a couple seconds? It sounded like it towards the end.
The problem Rhett has is the same thing as when you smell your armpit and its gut wrenching but you still go back for a second sniff 😂
We learned a lot here today. Lots of love in here. MVE!
0:24 - 1:08 without context.
Dj khalid!!!We da best!!!! Anotha one...
I agree with Josh on most things but I have never been in more agreement than right now about that burrito
You know when gmm is inhibited by copyright there is something wrong.
The Caesar burrito did NOT use mayo.
the themes feel like a weird al sampler
That was rough towards Chase lol
that girl is so pretty wtf
I love LTAT😂
“They try to be supportive, but can’t help but be judgmental.” Story of my life
This video had an identity crisis
Yeah, I suppose milk maids might give good handjobs. Not sure about general massage.
First 49 seconds were awesome.Who won the What challenge?
Who remembers when rhett had no beard
Rhett and Link almost kiss again LOL
i felt so sad for chase.. ik it's all make believe but still..
The Duff repeat from the last singing blooper vid is so funny.
18:00 its almost start.
Pat is seriously too awesome
Will it salad
Get to the singing here 18:08.
THERE IS LITERALLY NO REASON WHY YOU NEED TO COVER THEIR SINGING INTROS WITH GRAPHICS. PLEASE, DON'T DO IT ANY MORE!!!!
When I worked there I used to make that burrito all the time!!
What?!!
BOSS FIGHT
I wished they moved on and Josh just sits for a bit and then tries to subtly ask if he should leave, like he did the one other time. All his appearances should end that way.
The last clap hit home for me hahahaha
Classic Pat
I wasn't a fan of Chase bit. It's his birthday. Link! Make it up to him! (Rumor has it if you disrespect Chase, Cotton Candy Randy shows up angry with ya)
is link being dj khaled
The pride on their faces when they finish each song is what love :D
i love how while link and josh are debating how bad it is rhett eats basically the whole thing. a man after my own heart 😂
11:34 :( aweee haha
15:40 where is this going
What an intro.
Damn, R.I.P Chase.
You should do will it soda
I love when Link curses. It turns him from naive, innocent man into something else entirely.
Rhett boils his lettuce
This was just awesome from start to finish. From the way R&L got on set to Link, who stuck to his "Another one"-Bit. :) Very funny video!
What what what what?what
BEST THING THEY EVERRRRRRRRR MADE.   Once I was on pain meds and eating taco bell, I emailed the local franchise and complimented the local restaurant so much that they received an award and I got two free meals
What?...🤔
poor Chase💔
poor Chase💔
I swear this was titled "Rhett and Link Sing Without Music Part 2" when I started watching the video but after going back to my subscription feed... it was suddenly changed to Josh eating a discontinued burrito
Who else would love to see a JK! Studios collab?
18:08-22:15



You’re welcome 😉
Rhett slapping chases hand😂😂😂😂
Poor Chase : (
Another one!
Oh no, Link. Oh no.
I love how Rhett eats it all. I'd do the same
their entrance was a 3 act play itself
That intro was some quality Eric Andre show stuff.
I loved this when they had it
Whut 😂😂
The Caesar burrito was my fave
Tastes like vomit continues eating.
Why change the title?
I want to love someone the way Rhett loves Pat.
COCKTAILS

wooOoh
You guys should do Bloopers!! It will be so funny
i feel like this was supposed to be put on GMMore
Pat is such a lucky guy who gets to hug Rhett like that
Who's the guy at 19:13
I just wanna thank y'all for listening to our feedback and bringing back Ellie's boyfriend Pat.
0:25 This is how they assert their dominance
Josh has no butt.
Could you guys do Will it ice cream sandwich 2?
I get so confused when the thumbnail and title change within a few hours... does this happen to anyone else?
What!!?!?
Talk about DanTDM/daniel robert midelton
God damn Rhett and Link have a lot of clothes
That series of what’s was the best
i love pat so much tbh
Poor chase 😫😂
Hey gmm, I just listened to the AI ear biscuit. I recommend checking out the story of the game 'Detroit: become human'. It is a story that goes over robots feeling and having the desire for rights and true autonomy
How DARE Rhett diss Chase!  Just ... how DARE he!
i wonder if chase is actually that short or if rhett and pat are just reallyyy tall
Anotha one!
WHAT?!
Love love love Pat!!!!
WHAT?!
18:08 you're welcome xD
Awww who just wants to hug Chase for being left out, even knowing its a bit?
Cold caecar wraps are awesome :P
video seption
i love josh
I watch ltat only
I was expecting the clip where Link puts his spoon with  ice cream residue back again to the ice cream plate.
That’s why I couldn’t find the video, they changed the thumbnail and title
Pat should be on a gmm!
The kisser dinkers!
Is this male friendship?
I do love me a chicken wrap tho.
They have to smoke
Se convertira en taco? XD
I thought you guys were going to show a massive room and do all the stuff you did in chases office but much more over the top like a desk that goes forever 4 fridges full of different drinks full rotisery chicken ovens like at swiss shale just going, full bowling ally and a mini golf course.
Oh, Link...
Rhett and Link were like two dogs at the beginning
Morning what what what what what
They're so tall that you can't even see each other when they stand
still can’t get over the intro omfg i’m laughing so hard
Poor Chase... LOL
ANOTHER ONE
W H A T
Hot Lettuce is playing at the Comet Lounge on Wednesday if anyone wants to come.
Pat and Chase are like another Rhett and Link.
hey now, hey now, this is what dreams are made of
20:21 🤣
Wait... Rhett has a brother?? Is he also giant?
What am I missing? Is this an inside joke I skipped over?
What?!
What? 0:23-1:06
12:33 how is Rhett only moving one eye?
11:45 hahahaha
what what what! WHY WHY hUAT! WHO
13:50 why was there another person saying do you wanna go up wtf
Such a nice song.
So so good
why  do they swear so much off camera
Ducking
Ducking
Next time, just have the episode be that it takes them half an hour to sit on the couch
Warm lettuce is wet and slimy and makes me gag
ducking
The girl who is doing the casting is really cringy.
Do a will it waffle!
"Duh!"
What?

Awkward girl?
WHAT?
I mean Chase's hair looks awesome!!

I know it was a joke but awhhh poor chase :(
WHUT?!

Another one!
I really want to know: who was the one person clapping at 1:05?
This is whut dreeeeeeeams were made of hey! hey!
You guys still make videos i been watching since I was 5 and now im 11
I love when they sing.
Taco bell again
I loved that
Yeah i love you don’t tell them before you start singing those are the best... except the ninja one that was super awkward to watch for some reason 😬
Ducking heck
I was so sad that they didn't do the Chicken Ceasar Burrito and now I'm so happy! I remember being intensely upset when they discontinued it. I can't have been the only 11 year old who liked it...right?
Poor Chase haha.
.... What
24:58 i came
That burrito is the only reason I could ever get my bf to go to taco bell willingly. He LOVED it, and they discontinued it. So now it is always a struggle getting him to go now. Taco bell please bring it back!
What?
What?
what!
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
rhett and link singing without music
I love Josh
Love seeing Pat, he's so funny!
I love Josh
I love Josh
Another one?
Another one!
Another one!
The beginning with rhett and link was the whitest straight male thing ive ever seen
Another one!
I feel Link being a 42 male my self . Squeezing that utter would just mean she had strong enough hands to melt my muscles like butter .
what?
what?
what?
wHuaT?!
In the bosses’ office without being in trouble is a great birthday gift.  Too bad it was more of Pat’s trip.
That was weird.
Someone please let me know how many times they said "What" at the start, that was great
I think Pat is Rhett's boyfriend now
This Chase and Pat birthday surprise is cracking me up! I have to suppress my laughing because I am at work, and it hurts because there is so much laughter built up inside of me! (I lost it when rhett was trying to figure out the handshake!)
18:07
Nobody is gonna comment on link cussing. I was so surprised! Lolzm
I went into a Taco Bell and they were testing out a Caesar crunch wrap with a giant crouton in it, it wasn’t very good
um....what?
Hey now,shes a rock star,shes got her game on,she gets paid,her hair glitters like gold.
Oh my god, Stevie 🙏
21:36
Iron man dies
Try rice burgers ! 🍚 🍔
Wonderful
good stuff guys.
what?
What?!
What?!
What?!
What?!
Why can't they just sit down?
WHAT
21:55
WHAT
WHAT
That was a weird little cockfight at the beginning.
ANOTHER ONE
What is ring with Rhett’s foot 22:33
Why did the title and thumbnail change? Taco Bell threaten you all? Haha. Or is the music part just more popular with fans? You should put the red LTAT logo back in the corner of these videos too. I'd always see it and be like, "Yes! I forgot it was Saturday."
fosho.
Can LTAT get its own Youtube channel? I have been deceived several times thinking that it was just a regular GMM episode.;
21:54
Not all Caesar dressings are made with mayo....
What happened
WHAT
I miss the Baja Gordita.
What!?
wHAT
Chase, I'll be on a flight to America tonight. I'm coming to fight Rhett and Link for doing you wrong.
What?
I love how hard Link tried to get noticed with his subtle 'another one' gag throughout the episode and no one paid any attention. And now no one in the comment section has mentioned it either! It's alright Link I thought you thought you were funny <3
I wish LtaT was on its own channel or Good Mythical More so I'd quit accidentally clicking it.
Poor Chase ...lol
I'm only here for Pat
“The show about the show “
Who would win in a fight? Rhett or Link? Like for Rhett comment for Link.
21:56
WHAT
Chase is like the cool cousin you put up with a crappy reunion for..
Chase = Shane Dawson
There's a  restaurant here called Border Grill and they have a chicken caesar wrap that has their border sauce and caesar dressing inside and it's honestly my favorite item, I missed it when I moved away and it was the first thing I got when I came back.
I hate having a dirty mind
i rly thought he was chase's bf before i saw on his ig that he has a girlfriend
0:33 Stevie's face is the one of people who have to deal with bosses that act like children
Chef Ramey had a word with grilled lettuce on “Kitchen Nightmare”
poor chase
Awww poor Chase... 😢
will there be a third buddy system?
WHAT
I always find it funny that they're from nc, yet they now resemble the type of people that would move to asheville for all the trendy breweries and activities lol.
I'm glad that Pat was willing to come along for the gag again, but I was hoping Chase'd take Link.
what.
MASSAGE ME LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH COWS
YOU GUYS CAN KISS YOUR CAESERS OVER THERE
What does link whisper at the end of each episode?
I'm just curious as to who sits there and waits to change the thumbnail every 30 min, why

Did I miss what link got for chase??
Poor chase

Not that I care, but it seems like they are actively trying to swear more lately
Chase reminds me of shane dawson for some reason
Wasn't the balls one in the first compilation?

Which episode was 19:14 again?
who is that guy?
whut
falalalalalala balls
Am I the only one who thought that during the "what" battle, a "please stand by" card would pop up, immediately cutting afterwards to Rhett and Link peaceful on the couch?
Why do they always change thumbnail
Is that really their office! Because it looks awesome
:'(
You saying another one is probably worse than her saying hey now

Rhett really hates chase, huh?
These guys need some socks.
What
I cannot believe you didn't even MENTION End Game!!!
wut
CAAAAEEEEEESSSSSAAAAAAAAAR
Gosh Link! Watch your mouth!
During the singing clips, I can figure out all the guests except for the one at 21:37.  Anybody know who that is?
I low key feel really bad for Chace
How do they not get copyright striked for basically singing the tune of the song?
When was part 1?
What ever happened to the god damn santa fe sauce 8....(..
Just put the sad Charlie Brown Christmas song over Chase
DUCKTAILS!
Braised lettuce is a thing though...I know Gordon didn’t think so but it is.
What episode is 19:14? I've seen clips of the episode on fan page channels but never GMM.
Rhett is kinda dressed like bojack horseman
That intro was performance art
i love the limp bizkit one
🤣🤣🤣 I love them, this is my favorite episode of LTAT so far!
Every episodes gets more and more eric andre at the begining
The more entrances they do in ltat the more I'm uncomfortable 🤢
Poor chase. We love you 💕😍
Last time I was this early Rhett didn’t have a beard and Link did
I hope Ellie never has to break up with him....that would be awkward.
They already showed the balls cake part !
I really loved today's LTAT
An0thEr OnE
Pat is a gem.
a..........    whut?
Hi
what episode is that , at 19:15 ?
GUYS.. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS NOT EATEN BY RHETT AND LINK IS “VOMIT”.
I thought this was watching Rhett and link sing without music and now it’s about a burrito
Where link's gift for Chase though
I bet they weren't getting the normal clicks so they changed the title. I didn't click initially when I saw this because Im not about that singing stuff. But taste test... im in on.
Again. This format is just weird to me
Ok so the macho what's in the intro was so f-ing perfect!
AMAZING INTRO!!
Stevie’s hair is so beautiful 😍
Off Topic question, any chance of another season of buddy system? that show was fantastic.
Your intro is getting better, the guys is worse.
They should make it "Good Mythical Morning with Rhett, Link and Pat". Or maybe just "with Rhett and Pat" :P
Just kiss already!!
Pat + Chase
WAHT? WAHT?
I love Rhett
18:08
WHAT!
Lets go youresoloud
What
I love when cotton candy Randy came out and licked links ear.

WHAT?!
Waaaiiiitttt. Josh isn’t much older than me 😱 I wanna be a mythical chef....
I'm happy to be at an age where I both have no idea what "ducking" is, and no interest in even bothering to google it.
Children are in charge there
I'm a cook at Sonic Drive In and we have a grilled chicken wrap. I can't say I ever tried the Taco Bell version but ours is truly delightful yet so simple. It consists of merely grilled chicken, lettuce, ranch, and diced tomatoes. (Q: I'm from Texas. Are there Sonic's in Cali? If so, does it even compare to other fast food options there? Please excuse my ignorance.)

Why not put ceaser in the commercial it was you'll be ceased by ceaser
All of us 3rd Mythical Society members know what is up in the secret in The Secret Loft
Wewt another GMMLTAT....
Are we able to buy those yellow Damyell sweatshirts? i really want one
I really enjoyed the compilation!!!
I love LTAT even with the angry whats...lol
0:24 - 1:08



What...
Who needs scripts when they enter like that haha
Best.Entrance.Ever.
2:44 risky bisniss
WHAT?
WHOT?!
What......?

You need to title these episodes LTAT: "Title you were going to put" That way we actually know it's an LTAT
Is it just me or is Chase good looking?
You guys are way too in everyone’s faces. Like I get it but it’s too saturated
What does bymb stand for?
@ 10:10 - Rhett won a trip to Chase’s office? She’s speaking my style, dyslexic.  I approve.
hi I’m Esther gotta go
Pick on someone that is NOT Chase. My lil heart aches for the nugget.
Does anyone else think Chase kinda looks like Shane Dawson? Sorry if this has already been mentioned lol
nobody:
Link: ANOTHA ONE
Sooo where's Jen?
Thanos....... jk I’m not one of those people but very great movie tho 👍🏽
Idk why but i love it when they swear 😂

Feeling you, Chase
Please come visit chapel hill😭😭
ANOTHER ONE!
I thought they recorded the songs later
go to sleep
Not first
W H A T
Ducking ridiculous.
Ok
I feel bad for chase
Whatever happened to the other cook? The female one. I can't remember her name.
I don’t get why this format is merged into the main GMM channel when this should be a standalone channel. I have no interest in this wannabe presenter. 

So no way to block it from my feed. Hope this feedback is read by GMM.
Aw man.... I hated seeing Chase being bullied 😭😭😭
Please put LTAT in the title of the video!!!!!!
No one:




Link: ANOTHER ONE
Does fosho stand for something on the cup? Or is it just fosho as in for sure?
Anyone else having a problem with the like button? For some reason it reports the video as flagged when I press the "like" button. It's happened a couple times today
Stevie's hair looks gorgeous
Pat: everyone's third wheel
Stevie at 0:45 is me 24/7
The intro alone was one episode for me
It's always sad when you can only get halfway through LTAT before having to leave for work... RIP me 😭
WHAT?! WHAT! WHAT?
I prefer Kiss ‘Em and Eat ‘Em now
I will never saw the loft because i am even shorter than Chase.

Good morning everyone.

ducking? has someone gone Quackers? lol
One of the most boring  video by this channel. Not enjoyable.
Which episode did they visit Chase’s office in?
I'm with you Link, I was waiting for them to get attacked by Julius Cesar. Then I realized the spelling is different 😂😂
I don't get that intro. Why ducking? And besides, you never wrote a videogame walkthrough then.
I thought they were gonna kiss at first, was slightly worried but now we’re good. 😂
take a shot every time you here WHAT......
Hahah, I Love Stevie!
Im that napkin man... the napkin man, i dispense napkins as fast as you can.

Can someone tell me the actual song name at 20:34 ?
Let's talk about IRON MAN DIEING IN END GAME
24:40 Yeah, "backrub" Link..."backrub" 😹
I don't think he even knows what he is saying half the time.
Wow, I have only just realized Link's striking resemblance to Dana Carvey from Wayne's World! 
Am I alone on this one?
They should have done a blind test without knowing which one is healthier
Ok. I rewatched just to see if tgere was a double dipwith residue, and unless they cut it off, Link didn't do it. 😂
Link didn’t double dip with residue. I rewatched
Always disappointed when it's not a blind test... 
Honestly, even on the ranking items episodes.
Rhett:  I like a big handed lady 

Tormund: 👀
You guys should do an ultimate Ben and Jerry's taste taste and rank all the flavors (or at least some of them, since they have a lot)
They didn’t laugh but I died when Rhett said “I’m vanilla I don’t need more”
“This is a push mower? Homie don’t play dat”
Guys you should’ve done a blind test. It’s the brand name effect- it psychologically affects your perception and liking of something based on its reputation/price
don't worry link, I do the same thing when I eat ice cream from a spoon...and no double dipping...don't worry about the haters!
Link never double dipped with residue I went back and checked lml
Don't worry Link. That's exactly how I eat my ice cream too.
I leave half as well, Link. It's too cold otherwise. Don't let her shame you.
Gotta agree with Link,vanilla ice cream is amazing.
i was waiting for a slow-mo replay of link dipping his half eaten spoon into the ice cream after him saying "i would never!!"
Finally bluebell in an ice cream episode. ❤️
Cutting fat and increasing sugar is so counterproductive I can't-
Me: I probably should study for finals  sees GMM has video *watches youtube for 2 hours
Can you both do a vegan vs regular ice cream video? Enjoyed this video 😀
no one:
literally nobody:
not even a soul:
Rhett: "I like a big-handed lady"
I didn't see a double dip. And I don't understand why she felt the need to call him out on that in the middle of a episode anyway. That's kinda crazy. Stay in yo lane
DONT WORRY LINK i eat my icecream the SAME EXACT WAY! I have very sensitive teeth too!
Why no blind taste on this one? Meh
You guys should do vegan products taste test. That would be so could!
Who cares if he even doubled dipped..these dudes have done baby birding and all kinds of other weird mouth to mouth activity lol
I have literally driven to another state with a cooler to get Blue Bell Ice Cream.
Rewatched the video, no double dips. You're in the clear Link.
11:55

I noticed that I always do the same thing of leaving a little bit on the the spoon
 AND I NEVER KNEW WHY 😂
That made me so mad when she INSISTED that he double dipped his residue in the ice cream. He really didn’t...
I had to rewatch to see if link dipped his residue back into the ice cream. And I can confirm he definitely ate it all everytime!
No one: ...

Rhett: Asks for an extra spoon for the first one. Doesn't use it throughout the episode

Everyone : 🤨
My two video requests 
1) lip reading competition 
2) bad joke telling
Why not just rename the channel "Good Mythical Taste Tests"?
"There's just something about it that says 'I'm being compromised'" LOL
Bummed this wasn't a blind taste test! 🤔😭
Link did not leave residue on the spoon and put it back in the bowl! 







Like if u agree
I just subscribed to Owen Benjamin
Thank you for the recommendation!
"Homie don't play that" I love the in livin' cover reference!
I have to say, the way Link eats his ice cream by eating only half of the spoonful does make me uncomfortable for some reason.
Nah link was clearing the spoon before dipping back in he just eats weird 😂💕
Link did not double dip his residue just re watched
A video with Brendon Urie would be so good
Link I do that with ice cream too. Not always but a lot of the time I do. I think you're fine tbh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
gonna rewatch this to see if link dips the residue
Hey you...





Have an awesome day you beautiful person!
Bro i moved too north Dakota so I could watch your showes early er
LOW SODIUM VS REGULAR. (soy sauce, chips, etc.)
Not all ladies have to be tiny little delicate people LINK. Strong hands, Strong character
Shouldve done it blindfolded....they already had bias opinions....
Link: "(...) I love this just... plain vanilla..."
Rhett: "I want more, man. I want more out of life." 😂😂😂


Well said, Rhett!  Cheers!!!👍
13:20 Rhett: "People will fight! you over some blue bunny"

Me: "Crap, so I did make the news late Friday"
You have to get the good blue bunny flavors. Monster cookie dough is my favorite. Theres some kinda mixed berry pie flavor thats really good too
dont waste your time looking for it he doesnt do it :)
I love you bluebell👌🏼😂 btx
You should try Enlightened, Halo Top, So Delicious etc. - just the "healthy" versions.
I remember the video when link got a new hair cut and his hair went up not down.
The next day my whole class was shook
No sugar added ice cream can be awesome... when that's the only part of the recipe you change.
I definitely eat my ice cream the same way as Link and I honestly have absolutely no explanation for it I just have always done it 😂
Slow churned taste exactly the same...
6:14 IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?
As a female who milked cows for a whole decade, I can say that my hands are average sized.
LINK DID NOT DOUBLE DIP HIS RESIDUE
0:00 - 0:02

The one I dont eat 😂
The best Blue Bunny product is their ice cream sandwiches. 
The other lines are pretty meh
I totally agree with link with the whole raking it off the top of the spoon. I do it all the time and it’s amazing.
Another day that Link and I coordinated the wearing of the dragon shirt... Another day.
You should find the best lactose free food and deserts! Help me! 

-A lactose intolerant person
9:00 My type of guy! Vanilla over chocolaye any day!
For the record, Link doesn't double dip with ice cream residue on there
Watching two guys eating ice cream!Wow my life rocks
Breyers rhymes with dreyers
Blue bunny or blue bell
My Husband is a vanilla. I feel you Rhett...we need more out of life!
It's okay Link, I also take half off the spoon each time. No clue why. Just what I do.
To Link's credit, he does lick his spoon clean before dipping it into the other ice cream.
I subscribed 💟 you guys are my favorite and you are amazing
This should be a blind tasting and pick the best smh 🤦‍♂️
Sugar free energy drinks vs Regular energy drinks
I got up late and went to play with my friends but they won’t let me, thanks for this video it’s a good cheer up!
My grandpa used to say: “The pecan goes in the pie, the peecan goes under the bed.”
Hearing links explanations for the strange things he does just makes my morning 😂
Rhett - I like a big-handed lady...
Uma Thurman has joined the chat
I do the EXACT SAME THING Link! No judgement!
I eat ice cream the same way as Link and my parents make fun of me for it😂
Rhett: "I didn't know Dreyer's was Eddy's"
Me: "Well, I didnt know Eddy's was Dreyer's"
“I like a big handed lady”
Me: 🤲🏻
yeah i double checked to and link did not double dip juuuuussst saying >//<
Ahh they should have done the blind taste test their reactions are always so good! 😂
I also did not know realize the "c" in c-store was for convenience. 😂😂
You should do a march madness bracket next year for best ice cream flavor
The way Link leaves some ice cream on the spoon is low key satisfying
“I WOULD NEVER DOUBLE DIP WITH RESIDUE!”

Same
i like certain brands for certain flavors, like mint chocolate chip, i only like homemade brand { shrugs }
For the $, Edy's Pb/Choc is da bomb, lol.
That was a genius way to double the watch time!
Y'all should try combo loves... Pepsi and Milk the way Laverne did it and this new strange challenge with Reeses Peanut Butter Cups and Mayo. I've drank the Pepsi and Milk on more than one occasion but I dont see myself attempting that challenge... Ever. PERFECT you Y'ALL😉
Hahaha I went to State for four years and I had noooo idea the C in C-Store was for convenience until this moment 😂💀
DAAaaym.




And last time I was here there were only like 573k people and now there 15FriGiGin million!! You guys r doing good keep up the work!
Nobody:
Everybody: LiNk DouBLe DiPpEd
Checked the instant replay footage.  Link did not double dip with ice cream still on his spoon.  He eats, eats again, then goes back for more.
P-CAN OR PA-CON  but here in Wisconsin we say P-CON
Everyone look at how Link said hug at 7:24......
For the record... Link did have a clean spoon before redipping. (Yes I was that person who went back and analyzed...)
Me: I'm going to go to bed early tonight

Me at 3am: woah these middle aged dudes can eat alot of ice cream
I’ve never looked so much at links spoon before 🥄
“I would never double dip with residue”
Hahaha Link, Link please stop.
Link 11:59 I would never! 
Also Link 2:10
Original blue bunny looked like a tub of vaseline at a glance!!
BLUE BELL, BABY! TEXAS REPPIN'!
Think about those hands on that maiden..
I just had it get confirmation for myself. He doesn’t do it. #justiceforlink 😃
When you watch GMM in the afternoon 





Wait, that's illegal
"Yeah, I would never want to eat this."


continues to eat
Grateful Dead reference my day is complete now
Steve was actually wrong, he never did that, I  actually rewatched it to see if he did it and i missed it lol
2:09 and 2:17 
EVIDENCE!!
Lmao I double dip with residue as well 😂
They used my wheel submission video!! Thank you so much!!! <3 Freaking out if you couldn't tell
Rhett-will milk a cow for 15min to eat icecream.         
Also Rhett-thinks it is weirder to have to play a guitar for 21min!😂
Rhett’s daily fun facts 
“If you milk a cow for 22 minutes you can burn 50 calories.”
You should invite Ben and Jerry on to the show so Link can hug them (with permission).
Homie dont play that - Link 2019 😂😂😂😂😂😂 he is me.
I say it like you all do pecan🤣
Link: "But would you sit in your car for 21 extra minutes in order to enjoy that taste instead of this"
Rhett: "yEs"
Link: "Me too."
I don't know why I found this funny.
You can burn as many calories in a hot bath as a 30 min walk
Should've blind tested! But awsome vid as always
I watched closely. He didnt.
Finally we get some Texas rep in an episode with Blue-Bell! Which is by far the best ice cream, no rebuttal.
Had to re-watch the whole thing!
2:08 Link puts down the spoon, picks it up at 2:32 and eats it. There is no double dipping everyone.
Blue Bell finally got the recognition it deserves!
remake The Unicorn Rap
I hated the way Link ate but I didn't think they'd point it out haha.... 
Wait.. Do I eat like that?!
"Homie don't play that."
How many people went back to see if he doubled dipped
All sorts of wrong with this vid GMM. 
1. It should be a blind test. Like you normally do. 
2. Good enough implies it’s still edible. Not giving the low sugar enough credit. But I never pick diet options to be clear.
Link: Think about those hands on that maiden
Rhett: what did we do to deserve link
That In Living Color shout out!
Less calories? Less calories?? Less calories?!?!
the inner grammanazi is going postal right now!
lol I was analyzing link, he didn’t dip it back in
I stopped watching this channel for like lots of years but I love how your personality hasn’t changed and your videos are still interesting 😂
Totally played it back. Link totally did not put his residue back in there. Totally.
Can you do a comparison video of Bang energy drink and Monster Reign? They have similar flavors and would like a blind insight
YES THAT BLUE BELL 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I eat ice cream the same way Link. You’re not alone. Rhett it’s not that hard 🤣
Don’t worry link I do the same thing 😂
Favorite intro? 
1
2
3
4
Or 5?
Use me as an "I love gmm" button
it takes me 10 to 40 minutes to clean my bunnies cage depending on Weather 
i'm washing it down or just replacing every thing
Link, the way you feel about vanilla ice cream is the way some people feel about cheese pizza.
Love the taste tests keep them coming 💯❤️
YOOOOOO! I love when Rhett and link post videos like these because they always seem to end off my nights perfectly. Best thing to watch before you sleep! keep making these
Whaaat?! Blue Bunny Homemade Vanilla is the best!
Stop using the frikkin word compromise gah
So glad you guys included blue Bell this time. Best ice cream out there
Homie dont play that!😂😂
Rhett: I need more...
Also Rhett: I'm vanilla i don't need more
Gelato is better than regular ice cream by far, there is a wider variety of flavors and it's just so damn good!
As far as healthier icecream alternatives I like halo top a lot. Some flavors are better than others
We say puh-con in Louisiana (southern La. anyway) or something close to it. Are we the oddball of the south again?
you have to do "will it bench?" you've done "will it chair?" so "will it bench?" is the next step
Rhett said they should call it compromise 🤣
I personally didn't see Link "dip with residue"
I feel like this should have been a blind taste test🤷🏻‍♀️
"I like a big-handed lady" -Rhett 2019
“Sharing dairy products is bold” 😐
Breyers/Dreyers. Blue Bell/Blue Bunny. 🤔
I agree with Link.  I don’t like the ice cream touching my teeth.  I do the same thing.
Leaving things in Milk! And use a lactase pill or so :D
Link did not double dip his spoon. Although neither used a different spoon after a certain point. But he did set the spoon on a dirty table.
For the next march food showdown they should do ice cream flavors
I love that they addressed Link's habit of leaving half the ice cream on the spoon. It was getting to me lol glad to see I wasn't alone
1:24 I didn't know dreyers was edys either but when they pulled out the carton of ice cream it looked wrong. Like mislabeled or something. Lol weird
Link is my husband when it comes to taste in icecream and Rhett is me haha #needmoreoutoflife
he never did... i went back and rewatched the whole thing... he never double dipped the spoon with icecream still on it. he always cleaned it off first :)
so.. steavie is not invited to my table for lunch or dinner or anything ever. Im gonna double dip and if you cant handle that you GTFO
Having the thumbs down with fingers pointing toward us is strange. The hand can't be positioned like that!
Popular saying of Rhett: distinct
Popular saying of link: consistency
Always fun when someone drags Link
11:50 wait people have a problem with that?
"I will NEVER put my resudue in there!"
Yes you did Link We all watched you
"But I will come up Big" - Rhett McLaughlin 2019
“It’s got a badonkadonk.” 😝😂
I feel like Zack has his life together after watching that wheel intro.
I agree with Link that the ol "Rake of the top" method is a solid way to go about eating your ice cream.
PS I see no deal with the slight residue, these guys have been friends forever.
Never saw the double dip......clean(ish) spoon each time.....I'm on your side Link.....You do you.
"pee-can" is a southern thing?? I always thought "pih-khan" was the southern pronunciation for pecan. I may live/have grown up in the south but visiting the north so much, I never picked up on southern dialect /: I've always said and heard "pee-can" being said up north.
Blue Bell vanilla is better than Blue Bunny Vanilla, but Blue Bunny's other flavors are delicious.
Link saying badonkadonk made my whole day 9:32
The germaphobia on this show sometimes cracks me up =)  Yall should go watch mythbusters episode on double dipping.
It's been proven that double dipping really should be of no concern when it comes to germs.


If you think its bad manners its a different story but let's not be crazy
Chocolate  doesn't add calories - Rhett 2019
3:56 does anyone get that reference??
man, I love this show. there's a terrifying storm happening right outside my house right now, yet I'm still smiling :)
Thank you for doing this review - haven’t watched yet but I really love ice cream but I also want to be skinny
Not a blind taste test. Doesn’t really have the same credibility or excitement
I eat my ice cream like link. You're not alone good sir.
Should have done this without knowing which was witch and you had to decide which one was the low-fat one
This kinda feels like it would've been better as a blind taste test. Good stuff anyway
I’m just like Link I love plain simple refreshing vanilla 😋🍦
“Homie don’t play that” - Homie the clown 😂🤡
Gonna be a good LTAT lets talk about this residue
Ice cream is ice cream who agrees?

⤵️
Lets not ignore the fact that Rhett is lactose intolerant lol. Thank you for your service Rhett.
Adults with youtube Chanel’s don’t work out.





But some how this did
OH MY GOD, THEY FINALLY GOT BLUE BELL! 
Honestly, I agree, vanilla blue bell is probably one of my favorite ice creams and the original definitely tastes better. My family only ever gets the healthier one if my dad is for some reason eating it too (he has diabetes).
I just used 15 minutes of my life watching two dudes taste ice cream, and I loved it.
They should have tried Schwan’s vanilla, it’s the absolute best vanilla. IMHO
GRATEFUL DEAD THE JOJO STANDO
"It's got a badonkadonk. " -Link 2019 

You guys are so awesome 😂❤😂
Personally I prefer the Natural Vanilla Bean over the Homemade Vanilla Blue Bell ice cream. There’s just less milk flavor and more vanilla
Who just watched a video about air plane foamy stuff.
had to raid the store shelves for this one, eh? lmao
Rhett’s right, I will fight someone for blue bunny ice cream
Yo I've never been this early this is new😂
As weird as link is I can honestly relate to the way he leaves a little bit on the spoon lol
I dont think anyone not pushing 30 is gonna get that "homie dont play dat" reference lol
Link you consistently prove to have the same palette as my girlfriend, while Rhett reps mine
“So....” Rhett and Link, 2019.
Could you possibly sell it on dvd or amazon video?
Bell-o-phoria © Blue Bell 2019
The thing thats nasty about Blue Bell is the ingredients. next time youre at the store to buy some IC read the list...chemicals in there that most chemists wouldnt know and tons of em!!
 go Breyers. Milk, Cream, sugar. simple. perfection!
should have been a blind taste test
11:13 I thought he was gonna say the spongebob quote: "It feels like... someone... is trying to sell me something!"
Texan here....a pee can is where you urinate.
8:48 "Homie don't play that." Only real OGs will get that reference. 😂
“It’s got a ‘bedonkedonk’”😂
The c in c store stands for convenience? OMG I learn something new everyday even when it's finals time rn. Thx Rhett and link for this knowledge.
This should really have been a blind test
i just watched three times, i do not think he “double dipped his residue”
“Homie don’t play that” 😂
Shame you guys didn't get Umpquaa. Guess it's a bit regional. Know I couldn't find it when I was in South Carolina.
I work for blue bunny 😭😭😭
Links method is technically more accurate by making sure not to compromise the taste of the ice cream with the metal of the the spoon.
Do lactose free stuff vs stuff with lactose
Honestly I think you two should have a colab with Igp
Now I'm eating ice cream for breakfast. Thanks 😅😂
I wish this was my job XD
Bring Gordon Ramsay on the show
When you have to rewatch the episode to see if Link didny clean his spoon. He definitely cleaned his spoon!
Use separate spoons for each and immediately double dip
“I’m vanilla. I don’t need more”
gets more
Why call it delight, they should call it a compromise- 😂
“homie dont play dat push mower”
Is anyone here a Blue Bunny fan? I’ve always wondered if I just picked the wrong kind of what; I’ve personally never gotten into it.
right now
no one:

all of us: 三三ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ Good Mythical Morning
modified milk ingredients shouldn't allowed to be called "icecream",
its basically milk powder turned into cream, with 10 ibs of butter and sugar.
Somebody timestamp the dirty double dip !!!
Let's talk about that hit differently today
Texan here,  bluebell is THE BEST.
Oooh...the hostility! :-)
Zack tries waaay too hard.
Leave Link alone!! 😭
OMG I literally do the same thing as Link with how he eats ice cream!
Ok but HOW do you go to NC State and choose ben and Jerry’s over howling cow??
You should make a will it Pringle
Iron man dies in End Game
Even on flipping blue ray! 😮
Link's shirt today is sick.
Apparently you guys didn't live far enough south. In Texas we say pecan, not pee-can. That being said to each his own and I still loved the video!
Zac pissed me off with his face
milking cows is a euphemism, dont worry, i got it Rhett.
For anyone wanting to try out good low-carb ice cream, Enlightened makes some really good ones, as well as So Delicious No Sugar Added.  Not a fan of Halo Top though.
I am one of those people who will fight you over Blue Bunny.
“Homie don’t play that” flashback to Nasty Food Jenga there I like it
I saw him double dip too
Link, I eat ice cream the same way and I don't have an explanation for it either! Glad I'm not alone!
If I had a dollar for every time Rhett has explained why diet Dr. Pepper tastes the same a regular Dr. Pepper...
I cleaned my rabbit's cage for at least 10 minutes today. He is shedding like crazy.
Video wonderful I wish you a successful march
rhett that shirt is gorgeous
Link definitely didn't redip his residue. Ate it every time
6:13 I sense a JoJo's reference
Can you make anything with card board
Should have used a golden spoon
I’m glad y’all included the blue bell this time! That’s one of the quickest ways to piss off a Texan 😂
Should've done blind taste test to see if they could tell a difference and trick them by being the same
Blue bunny is already rough so Suger free is  even rougher
Feel like it was bias because they knew which was which
I don't think Rhett was talking about cows🙄lol
Cherry Garcia is also a good fro-yo
She's off her rocker.  Link did set the spoon down with some on it, but he did eat it.  He never dipped back in with a blob left on the spoon.  I rewatched to check because I can't sleep anyway.
I'm so glad Link mentioned the television thing at 2:10, I've tried to tell so many people that its like this extra-sensory ability, but no one I told knew what I was talking about.
No.. it's never p'cawn... Don't do that
I seriously didn't know that Blue Bunny was regular ice cream. I always seen it as diet ice cream. The name and lettering just screams diet. Glad to know it taste like shit
LINK where did u get your shirt?
Are we just gonna forget the fact that rhett is lactose intolerant
I eat ice cream exactly how Link does :3
Bring back Rusty and Larnold! #gmmseason1
I'm getting icecream right now! Now I don't feel left out.
I eat ice cream the way Link does but I never share ice cream
8:48 he said "homie don't play that" omg link 😂😂
Ok but what about the Ben and Jerry froyo version of Cherry Garcia without the chocolate lol i swear I've seen it in stores
I agree! Blue Bunny is awful ice cream.
When you're Canadian and haven't tried half the ice cream they just tested 😭😭😭😭
It's Friday night here in Australia. Thanks for helping out with my Friday night choices.
link do have a nice shirt tho
For GMMs 100th episode of this season talk about velcro
would love more competition taste tests and international taste tests
I am 3 ice creams in, and no flavors I like.
I seriously want, just every once and a while, for them to have a conversation based around a subject or a story. The food and games are so good... just not 5 days a week. I enjoy Ear biscuits... but it is not the same.
Breyers is fantastic, the salted caramel is only 340 calories and is delicious.
im with link


like if u agree
Gonna see that ice cream residue debate on LTAT
I eat ice cream the same way as Link does, same with yogurt and pudding.
That's how I eat my ice cream too! And my dad always makes fun of me xD
Clear links name! He did not double dip his residue
I love when rhett is taste testing he has a very serious look on his face. Lol.
Link with the relatable references for people that remember the 90s! He just quoted Homey D. Clown from In Living Color! "Homie Don't Play That"
love the double dipping debate going on in the comments 😂
Hey youresoloud do your thing 🤘
Needs a blind tasting factor
You should have done it blind folded
I do the same thing as Link!
Gotta go to the MAXIMUM fat when eating ice cream
He does not do a residue dip!
They should have tasted this blindfolded first
should’ve done a blindfolded guess for this one I think
I feel like this should have been blind to avoid implicit bias
"Pee can is for a truck driver" Emeril Lagasse
I like a big-handed Lady, as well, Rett.
shirts on point
When are we getting GMM on Blu-ray!?!
I won’t sign it and I won’t smell it, but I’ll come up big with the double dip!
"Think about the hands on that milk maiden. They're probably huge" Link says. "I like a big handed lady" Rhett replies. 😳😂
We have dreyers and eddys so I'm really confused
Can you do lactose free items VS regular dairy items
8:49 link double dips.
Methinks Link forgot what "savory" means
I don't think the Blue Bunny being good enough is what they meant...
LOL STEVIE I LOVE YOU
I eat it the same way Link!!! :D
I didn't know Dreyer's was Eddie's either. Mind blown.
Both Ben and Jerry are still alive (according to Wikipedia) they were both born in 1951 which would make them 68.
Rhett, it's called delight because it's light, lol
Wow Daniel Radcliffe really let himself go
Blue bunny is not ice cream Period
I have always known “dreyers” as edys
Roses are red 
Violates are blue 
I stayed up till 3am 
And so did you
Link never dipped with residue on his spoon he always cleaned it off before going back for more
Link, I eat my ice cream the same way. Don't let them bring you down!
hIS RESIDUE IS ALL OVER THE ICE CREAM
In Links defends, i eat like this too. I dip off the top first and the rest in second
Rhett and link are like the only duo that actually fits together
Testing mediation music for dogs.   Idea?
this episode felt like a gmmore i loved it
No one:
Rhett: counterparts
7:07 if only that was true!
Love the Homey the Clown reference. Makes me miss the good old days.  LEMME SHOW YA SOMETHIN!
im glad you said breyers after dreyers because i was having a mandela effect
Blue Bell is fantastic (the less healthy stuff)
I lovvvvvve French vanilla I’m with ya Link
I think you should make more videos on Rhett and link I really like that Channel and you Guys are my fav you tubers your really stick out to me thanks 😁🤣😂😁😁
Also Link " Before we dipped into the badonkadonk, I was feeling pretty good."
I’ve been teased for eating my ice cream the same way Link
Link Ben and Jerry they're both alive. 7:21
Link I’m totally with you, I love vanilla ice cream. It’s my favorite❤️ (people pick on me😂)
Good 'nuff?
Good stuff.
Please show proof of Link doing that on LTAT!!! 🤞🤣
8:48 Homey D Clown reference that I'm sure a huge chunk of the audience doesnt get, I love it.
these should be blind tested
I am just like Link.  we both love plain vanilla ice cream!!
blue bunny, dryers, bryers are all disgusting regardless of the flavor.
Blue Bells banana pudding ice cream is the best ice cream ever made.  Well, it is to this southern girl anyway.
Every single American product should cut the sugar (real or fake) by 50%!!!
the glare on his spoon makes it look like it has something in it....thats my hypothesis
Rhett says: Link I rather have the butter pecan with raspberry sauce.
After being on YMH podcast i now know i can trust you guys. God bless you.
Link is right no double dip seen.
I'm like Link with ice cream flavors. I prefer just a flavor (like Vanilla) and no chunks, ripples, whatever. I feel all the extra stuff ruins it...
I need some ice cream now
The south?? You are from North Carolina.. that’s east to me . Louisiana / Texas etc...that’s south
I eat ice-cream the same way Link does
i’ve never heard of dreyer’s in my life i always thought it was edy’s
11:02 Link double dips with residue
my favorite on campus activity is going to the c-store and grabbing cherry garcia.....i feel validated lmaoo
4:26 how much $ is that Dreyers ice scream with 1.5 Quart in the US ? In Germany its 20$. The Ben & Jerry´s is 7$ in germany
I like vanilla too. You are not alone link
Went back and watched a total of 3 times. Can confirm Link did not double dip with residue on his spoon.
When Rhett said that he felt disappointed with the Blue Bell Ice cream while Link felt at home, it reminded me of Buddy System Season 2. Did anyone else get that vibe?
I also eat my ice cream like Link. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Blue bell makes the best vanilla ice cream in my opinion
This is the 2222 Video posted on the Good Mythical Morning YouTube Channel!
I eat my ice cream the same way link! Lol it’s ok! 😂
No double dip, she lie LAWL
Taste test the new impossible burger please! We don't have it here yet :( only the old recipe.
Your bowels will be experiencing "sweet freedom" from all of these sugar substitutes.
You guys should do a video with Rob Scallon🤣🤣
The only time I could see him double dip with residue, was around 2:00, and the actual double dip was off camera, but we can see there was residue before he started talking and he talks consistently through when he gets more, so we know he didn't eat anymore and then dip again. But every other time I saw, he always cleaned the spoon before going in
This should have been a blind taste test.
You should get Ben and Jerry on the show.
DOUBLE DIPPER!
i like knowing that im not the only one who eats ice cream this way. thank you Link for standing so firmly behind your beliefs <3
iron man 英威腾 www.invt.com.cn
It's impossible to stay on a diet and still watch GMM, damn y'all
I do the same thing as link where you eat only half off the spoon
This should have been a blind taste test
You should have done a blind taste test.
I totally eat my ice cream like Link 😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♀️
I eat ice-cream the same way as Link - best way to do it 😋
I eat ice cream the same way as Link though lol
5:15 Rhett’s face when Link said maiden the first time 😅😂
I didn’t see a double dip and the second he picked the spoon up off the table I was watching!!! It made me very nervous but he did finish it before getting more!
8:25 Rhett missed the opportunity to say “Blue-phoria” 😂
Yeah represent New Hampshire!
WHY IS THERE ANOTHER NAME FOR EDDIES
y’all should do “best vanilla ice cream taste test” like go through the brands and try to guess and score them like tht
Both Ben and Jerry are still alive, and I have met them both.
Watching this early gives me more joy than when Link gets a knife😂 Yet being up these morning makes me feel like Rhett when Link gets a knife😂
blue bell yessssss the best
Don’t worry, Link, I too don’t completely rake the ice cream off the spoon. It’s just more enjoyable that way.

P.S. I also prefer melted ice cream over ice cream right out of the freezer. It tastes twice as creamy and I luv it :3
I think links spoon has a glare on it so it looked like he was double dipping
the mint ice cream had protein also in it ! thats probably why it was a different texture.
I was watching "Leaving Things In Champagne For A Month" waiting for this episode. I can watch them all day! GMM!
I'm siding with link. I take two bites from one spoonful.
I do that same thing link does with his ice cream on the spoon lmao
Is bellaphoria a word???  No, it’s not.
I totally eat my ice cream the same way 😂😂😂 and idk why
Havent slept yet so good mythical morning and good mythical night 😭❤️❤️
You should do a vegan ice cream taste test
Maybe I don't like ice cream because I grew up only a few miles from the Wells Blue Bunny plant
Blue Bunny is garbage
I love  Good Mythical Morning, because  im stressed about school alot, and it always releaves  my stress!
I feel like this should have been blind to avoid implicit bias
Endgame spoilers: Thor yells at Thanos in Fortnite and he gets ashamed so he joins the Avengers.
Rhett being a hungry boi again
You guys should do dairy vs. non  Dairy next
I grew up eating blue bell :)
11:53 yes I was thinking about how it bothers me the way hes eating it
2:41 as what Rhett also said, you can also burn 5 calories just by breathing
Its ice cream. In my opinion its always healthy lol though Blue Bunny is gross no matter what you do to it
My dad love this show . Yesturday at a resistant 
We dinked it and sinked it
hi zach come to unh thanks
Ok. I rewatched just to see if tgere was a double dipwith residue, and unless they cut it off, Link didn't do it. 😂
They are agreeing too much here. Its bizarre!
Where did they get Blue Bell in California????
Link did not double dip with any ice cream on the spoon. she be cray cray jk lolz :P
2:35 - "I still got some on this spoon." - Link
I also do the half bite off the spoon. And I didn't see a residue double dip.
“I like a big-handed lady.” 
-Rhett McGlaughlin, 2019
Its got a baDONK-baDONK
I was not comfortable with Rhett talking about milking cows
Like we were talking about cows right?.
Anyways when will you do a best Ice Cream tournament?
Ba donkey donk lmao
I' was eating ice cream when this popped up!
I love the guys but I have to disagree blue bunny ice cream is one of the best ice creams out there ... after ben & jerry's of course ^^
How does GMM know I’m going on a ice cream binge as of lately? Thought this was an old vid but saw it was new as I clicked. 

Morning made
link ate all of it every time
You should do it blindfolded
Pucan is the right way to say it peecan is what peas come in
to be fair, I eat my ice cream the same way as link 😂
LINK DID NOT RE-DIP
We can all agree no one likes blue bunny it is all about Blue Bell .
I also do the same thing link does, it's just a habit I like to do
I agree with Link on the half spoon for the ice cream.
5am can't sleep glad to have something to do.
Hey Rhett, I'm a big handed lady. 😉
10:45 watch link leave ice cream on spoon and drizzle some slobber cream back into the bowl.
after it was pointed out I re-watched it all over again and never once does he dip residue back in
No Yarnells 😞
"Homie don't play that" - Link 2019
I think Blue Bunny used to be really good, but then they changed their ice cream and flavors :/
Omg I do the same thing Link does with the spoon, every time 😂😂 it seems like I’m not the only one 👀
🇺🇸 have huge ice cream containers compared to 🇬🇧
It’s got a BONDONKADONK
You like “savory ice cream” ??? What, like mashed potato flavored ???
I like coke zero more than coke
Should have done it blind.
I eat ice cream the same way Link does.
I think they’re slowly running out of ideas 😂
Where did he double dip. I want her to show me the exact moment.
I gained my Freshman 15 my junior year living in Bragaw hall, right next to the C-Store.
I hate when people double dip but what's a instant fight drinking out of my milk jug 😡
You all should try Ben and Jerry's Almond Milk Icecream.
I knew Ben and Jerry wouldn't let me down.
Where do I get the blue ray of the songs? It was awesome live and I wanna relive it!
blue bunny is the cheapest tasting ice cream
I do the same as link with my ice cream and my yogurt! Same about the teeth thing but also for the smoothness on the lips when you leave some on the spoon! BUT I dont dip with residue!
“I’m vanilla, I don’t need more.” Rhett 2019
I absolutely hated the way link was eating the ice cream...
BLUEBELL!!! Finally you guys ate it on your show. The best there is!
rhett has no frame of rabbit reference
Anyone else rewatched the episode just to see if Link really did redip his ice cream residue into the bowls?
I eat ice cream the same way that Link does 😂
What about waffle fries?!
I just hope GMM has a  REALLY, REALLY good cleaning crew, with all the stuff (& all the yuck) that has been on that desk.
The problem with ice cream  isn't the fat, it's the unholy amounts of sugar.
"The thing about this, you open this up you gonna eat the whole thing." And that's a problem? How?
Alright I've watched enough GMM to know Link is neurotic at this point. It's gone beyond funny or entertaining, it's concerning how much is wrong with him.
rhett's face at 5:16 lmaoooo
Dump the Binny
When ever gmm uploads every thing in my life stops and I steam gmm for more than an hour.😂😂. Don't judge me. 



Ps. I love the show, keep up what your doing because it's amazing.
Should have done a blind taste test
I eat ice cream the same way. I'm on your side
The way Link eats it is 100% the correct way to eat ice cream
could have  gone with the cold sensitivity excuse. .
You guys should do a collab with molly burke and do a taste test blindfolded.
Homemade vanilla is different than vanilla blue bunny
Will it Salad
I do the same thing as Link! I thought I was the only one!
Just a friendly reminder YouTube comments may have endgame spoilers.
I'm from Kentucky which is in the south and we dont call pecans pee-cans I call em pac-ans
Wait I do the same thing... I take a huge spoonful and then eat it off the spoon slowly
Yo, both Ben and Jerry are currently alive.
What is on rhetts shirt🧐
It's ok, Link. You're not the only one.
How are you gonna eat blue bunny and not get bunny tracks best icecream flavor out there
#JusticeForLink 🔥
Blue Bell taste test anyone?
I eat my ice cream the same exact way Link does.
Diet or regular soda
both, both is good
6:20 listen closely someone is dying behind camera hahaha
Who is watching while laying down be honest😎❤️
This should have been blind.. They are making up their minds before even trying it
I'm I the only one who only watches the food episodes?
Yes u did link yes u did
Anyone else worried about Rhett’s stomach after this episode?
Your curious if you read more..






Have a life full of love and happiness!!🧡❤💜😉💕💕
It's got a badonkadonk
Clean spoon after every bite... Or death...
HEY!!!  Plymouth, NH!!!
I thought Link said “Coke” flavor. Now that would be something...
Don't listen to 'em Link. I eat ice cream the exact same way. It's a savoring experience.
They should of did a blind test, n pick which was the more "healthy" version.
Is Link's hair line getting higher LOL!!
I really like that these guys know the Dead. But the jokes get old😂
I thought Eddy’s was a company waiting for a lawsuit
I'm from Iowa. I will defend Blue Bunny, even when it may or may not be deserved
Feature someone from endgame!!!!!!
I do what link does
I sort of eat ice cream like Link, but I clean the spoon before dipping back in for more ice cream.
My grandma does the same thing as Link with ice cream! It's so weird 🙄😅
howdy from Australia
now me want icecream...
and I’m out
You can tell they’ve never owned a rabbit because it takes a lot of work to clean a bunnies pen 😂 Ours are even litter box trained, but they messy babes
Lowfat isn't healthier just sayin
They should rank vegan ice creams ;D
"I'd never double dip with residue" 😂😂😂
I also eat ice cream like that. I'm scared of getting a brain freeze!
I eat ice cream the same way as Linkkkkk
Is no one gonna talk about the weird substance Rhett was talking about for the Blue Bunny ice cream
I really hate the way Link eats ice cream. That stupid lip smooshing thing he does drives me crazy in a bad way.
tony stark dies in endgame.
I love Halo Top ice cream. About 300 calories per pint and it tastes great.
I eat ice cream the exact same way as Link. It's the best
It’s sad that when you have not fell asleep yet and the GMM episode is already out
Shoulda been a blind taste test
How do you say you saw link double dip with ice cream on the spoon then say “I felt like you did”? Did you see it or did you feel it, Helen Keller? 🙄
Did not know dryers was a thing, looks like edys though
What’s your favorite ice cream? 
Mine is chocolate chip cookie dough
Moved to the west coast 2 years ago from Arkansas... I miss Blue bell soooo much.

I really don’t like the plain flavors of blue bunny but they do make some really go flavors
Ice cream and GMM!! It's a good morning! ❤😁
There’s a difference in serving sizes though!! It’s not just about servings.
For the record, in the South we say pe-chaan NOT pea-can Ever. Maybe South Carolina isn’t really the South. Lol #Louisianaforever
I love the new intro it's so catchy
I feel you guys could have taken a better approach to this segment trying halo top, yassp, and enlightened. ranking tastes.
Notification squad!!✅
Love blue bell
You two should do a mukbang
Should have been a blind test
I eat ice cream the exact same way for the same reason. Haha

At 2:12 the possible double dip
I'm eating a full pint of Ben and Jerry's right now.
The Coachella outbreak lol
Rhett Hun it is me your girlfriend
Living in a different timezone really helps with videos like these. I literally have never clicked on a video this fast!

Time to come up BIG
Deadheads unite!

I'd love for Rhett to tell us how everyday mundane activities burn calories, on the regular
5:08 i do that every night...
I love mint chip so much
I eat my ice cream just like Link, #teamlink
Notification Gang
Its ok I do the same ice cream thing sometimes link, lol.
Wth is a "pee-can"? It's ALWAYS p'-cahn!
Some of you haven't been keto for a couple years and can only enjoy Halo Top ice cream and it shows.
How did you get blue bell ice cream?!? I live in Cali but I was born and raised in Texas! I didn’t think blue bell was out here...please tell me your secret!
I'M FINALLY HERE UNDER 10K VIEWS YESS LIKE IF YOU'RE IN THE UNDER 10 K GANG TOO 🧡🧡
I really hope Link brings up the dipping issue back up on LTAT because he doesn’t ever double dip his leftover at any point. Lol.
You want to see me do a food challenge like this !
When Link said the ice cream got a Badonkadonk i died 😂😂😂😂😂
Both Ben & Jerry are alive they are both 68
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BLIND TASTE
link hits the woah at 5:40
Where was Kris Wu?
2:00, THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SPOONS YAH DUNCES
No one:Pecans
Link:Peecans
Link is in Denial
My family only likes Blue Bunny cause half of us have celiac and most of them are gluten free.
Hey rhett theres a video of you getting mad but i think its fake but i want the real answer from you can tell us in the next video pls
I like a big handed lady

I cant, I just cant😂
They never use Tillamook ice cream in any tests. They're missing out.
I eat ice cream the same way Link does lol
I just have to say cherry garcia is the best flavor of ice cream
Is it eddy's or Dreyer's?
Link: "Think about the hands on that maiden...."
Rhet: (says nothing but brain explodes with temptation)
they should've compared the calories for an entire pint, that's how you really see the difference !! like 1 b&j pint is around 1000 and 1 b&j moophoria pint is around 600
As a Texan, I forget that there are brands of ice cream other than Blue Bell.
The word "residue" has been ruined for me!
She is wrong and Link is right 😂
Looking for a time stamp in the comment where link re dips the spoon like a blasphemy
A guy in Georgia once told me that a “pee can” is where you go to the bathroom and pecan is a nut.
As I watched this video I just had to get some ice cream… that is exactly what I did
Please more videos in Spanish
Is bedonka a word???  No, it’s not.
It is 3 02 am where i live what about you?
I like how they just stopped switching spoons just kept using the same one.
I dont understand peoples problems with double dipping or using the same spoon; ive eaten out of the garbage many time and im still here
“I’m vanilla! I don’t need more!” 😂
They should have done blind taste test
Who else came here for Ben and Jerrys ?😂
It seemed to me like link always ate the little bit on his spoon before he goes back in for more. (*shrug*)
link...it’s eddies like the name
Yes, Link. So I'm not the only one who hears the TV when it's on but nothing is playing. Who else? 😆
I eat ice cream just like link, i always thought i was a freak lol
Just like his son.
is it just me but is stevee hot
I have to say I stand with link on that one
Link is innocent
I like cookie doe blue bunny but not vanilla
11:45 Amen to that!
Where is halo top?!?!??!
7:15 Btw Ben and Jerry are both still alive and they are only in there late 60s.
2:32


Sorry Link
“I like a big handed lady” 😂
I don't think anyone eats only 1/2 cup of ice cream.
(similar to march munch madness) Summer madness: Ice cream edition
I eat half the spoon of icecream too and I'm glad I'm not the only one anymore
Link totally did though
It was bothering me the whole time how link was eating his ice cream Haha
Ok nexed boring episode just icecream com on guys its bin done
Is it just me or does hmm get worse as the Rhett and link get older
I WOULD NEVER - 2:30
Good morning mythical beasts!
Link, I also take half the spoonful first and then eat the rest of it. And I also don’t know why I do it 😂
We really need a best ice cream remake
Now that you’ve both tasted bluebell, I’m sure they’ll blow the competition out the water.
i wish you guys did this blindfolded
Ben and Jerry are alive @Link
Both Ben and Jerry are still alive.
Southerners absolutely DONT say "pea-can"
I eat yoghurt how Link eats his ice cream lol
I eat my ice cream the same way as Link!!! A big ol' spoon and then nibble bits off of it, but never residue to get more!
Imagine Damnyell and Cotton candy Randy in one video-
It’s ALWAYS “pecans”. “Pee Cans” are what you tested on the episode earlier this week. :)
Dont know why but just thought of an idea ice cream floats with weird / different cola flavors. Would watch that video!
I do the exact same thing as Link while eating icecream!
why no blindfolds???
immediately thought of the "that's a ten" guy lmao
I eat it like link as well
Should have done it blindfolded.
One thing to note is that a serving is half a cup. They probably had 2 or 3 servings in each bowl.
Me- scrolling through YouTube 
YouTube- Good Mythical  Morning ?
Me-*breaks finger clicking *
Should have been a blind test.
Should have been a blind tast test
7:15, they are both alive. They're not that old. Ben & Jerry's was only founded in 1978.
I wish this was a blind taste test
This is how I know I've stayed up too late. Thank you end game for ruining my sleep schedule.
No he didn't,  an the 11:11 timestamp is not residued
the content on yalls channel is so great and you deserve all the views. i have zero outreach as far as getting you views but if i can ever do anything let me know haha
I do that with ice cream and a spoon, it feels nice on the lips and allows you to savour it.
i always thought i was more of a rhett guy but the comment link has about vanilla ice cream is me. I love the basic creamy vanilla ice cream.
Don’t worry Link! I eat my ice cream the same way! 👌
I love blue bunny, you guys are weird
ok i don't think link double dips with ice cream on the spoon but I don't think they should have been using the same spoon for both bowls
I also eat the spoon one half spoonful at a time. Im on links side here
Links shirt is kinda fire
Link was legitimately mad when he was accused of double dipping
Is anyone gonna tell Rhett that diet soda is worse than regular soda?😂
It’s about time someone called Blue Bunny ice cream crap. Gross.
If I'm having ice cream, it's the full fat, sugary, and generally delicious original. Forget the "healthier" kinds. Pleh!
I am here to defend link and his residual ice screaming eating habits. I do that too. Like if I'm not the only one
Homie don't play dat!!!!!  YES! A reference to the much beloved In Living Color! :-)
Is donkadonk a word???  No, it’s not.
Sometimes I feel like without Rhett, Link would still be in North Carolina somewhere eating peanut butter and vanilla ice cream almost exclusively.
Next time you may not want to try and humiliate Link. 😉
I eat it the same way as link
This is 3 minutes late, shame
They are always on Link’s case
3 types of ice cream. Vanilla chocolate and?????
Finally got bluebell. Enjoy.
It's not the fat that's unhealthy *facepalm*
Views for this video are double now because we all watched it twice lol
#TEAMBLUEBELL
Zack is cute
The way Link eats ice cream makes me want to punch him
Good mythical morning. I've eaten lunch 😂😂😂
I can’t get my time back after watching this
so instead of a game you just had them eat ice cream and tell us what they think of it? LOL
in the south we say puh kahn,  not pee can, only northern people call it peecan
Of course everything with a little more of sugar will taste 10 times better that anything without it...
why are there so many rules about how someone eats how they eat?
Gotta say i miss the stories of gmm rather than the constant food
This should've been a guessing game 😴😴😴
when is mythical pomade coming back?
Should have been a blind taste test.
They Should Do a Vegetable mixed Smoothie Blind Test
Leave Link alone for eating ice cream like that. I do the same thing
Meh. A more accurate representation of these tests should have been done blind. They’ve done tests like these in the past and have chosen healthier foods and off brands when not knowing the difference.
could you do a video on normal ice cream vs lactaid  or dairy free icecream?
It's ok Link, I eat icecream the same way. Not a big fan of cold icecream on my teeth.
How do these men not have diabetes? XD
i checked and i didnt finde the double dip stewie mentions she must be dreaming or she doesnt like link as much
You can play vr and burn callories whilst having fun.
They should go back to doing blindfolded taste tests!!!
Ben and Jerry are both still living.
Oh damn you have a Dairy vs Dairy Free Taste Test in the suggestions. Hells yeah!
Mr. Neil a butter pee can is what I call a toilet seat with urine all over it.
I have to say I might be bias!!  Blue Bunny is ALWAYS the best!!  It is made in the Ice Cream Capital of the World - my hometown!!!
They should’ve done a blind taste test of this! It takes out the bias of knowing which one is the “diet” version!
Watching this while eating ice cream Lol
Whoah, I was awake randomly and then I saw this notification and was like “Oh yeah, they come out around this time”.
Shouldn’t this be a blind test? Maybe? So no bias is implied.
11:00 if you look at his spoon not only does he double dip but has left over ice cream on the spoon and puts it in the other one. Ew
Where's the blindfolds?
Rhett is vanilla 😏
Since when was edy’s called dreyers
Petition for GMM to release a Mythical Cookbook with every YES to the Will Its
I am fully in defense of Link here. Not once did he dip his residue back in the ice cream and that is a perfectly acceptable way of eating ice cream.
To lose weight I just lowered the amount of Real Coke instead of hating my life and drinking zero Coke
It really bothered me that Link didn’t eat the spoonful he had at the start and he just left it on the spoon 😭😭 that whole few seconds before he ate the rest stressed me out
Link may not leave half a spoon full when he dips back in, but there is still a smear of ice cream on the spoon. I'm more concerned with the saliva bacteria that they're sharing.
I’ve eaten entire cartons of that Blue Bunny, Because it’s so much better than other ice creams, in my opinion.
I feel sorry for Rhett's GI in this episode
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode Day 78: "Think about the hands on that milk maiden" - link
That bugs me how link doesn’t get all the ice cream off his spoon the first time...
It's just so human to take something great like ice cream and ruin it a little so you can have more of it.
More fat is better than more sugar technically
there was a lot to question in this video but the biggest thing for me is finding out blue bunny actually makes big things of ice cream and not just underwhelming "single sized" servings in tiny bowls
Thanks for reminding me i have ice cream in my freezer. Time for dessert:)
So who's gonna tell em that both Ben and Jerry are still alive lol
Shouldve done it blindfolded....they already had bias opinions....
They never blind themselves, it isn’t fair lol
PLEASE TELL ME THERES GONNA BE A REPLAY IN LTAT TO SEE IF LINK PUT HIS SPOON BACK IN
SO HAVEN'T I!!!
Please, do DAIRY vs DAIRY FREE ice cream taste test...some people have allergy for dairy products
I eat Ice Cream the same way as Link. My fiance makes fun of me and my response for the reason why was the same thing! "Because I only wanted that much!"
i always thought i was more of a rhett guy but the comment link has about vanilla ice cream is me. I love the basic creamy vanilla ice cream.
Just buy yer damned icecream folks
Blue bunny chocolate is where it’s at
Oh my gosh when she said link was leaving the ice cream on the spoon 😂😂😂 I noticed it the very first time and I’m like oh my god I’m not the only one😂
Iron man dies.
WHY IS ALL ICECREAM SERVING SIZE 1/2 CUP?! WHO EATS 1/2 CUP? GO TO THE KITCHEN, GET A 1/2 CUP MEASURE AND JUST LOOK AT IT! IT'S LAUGHABLE! DO IT!

okay...I'm okay now. 😮
Good mythical morning yall happy Avengers endgame day!!! 1st
Should have been a taste test
Ben and Jerry are both still alive. They're only in their 60s.
They should get Taylor Swift to be on the show
Is this an old episode? Or am I experiencing the mandala effect
So weird, but I had this same thought this morning. I leave the house and watch says 0 calories burned. I get to work and somehow turning my steering wheel has helped me burn 21 calories.
Hold up, Rhett went to NC state? If that’s the case you know he was getting that dozen crispy cremes for “a party” and eating them by himself in the dorm.
8:25 Rhett chose to say Belleforia instead of Bluforia and i’m highly disappointed
omfg u will never run out of ideas....
You guys should AIR FRY a ton of foods and show us
Good Mythical Morning Mythical Beasts!!!!☀️🐓 this is odd never been this early 3am.. Notif squaad tho👀🔥🤣
I eat ice cream the same way link does, with leaving half on the spoon and then eating the second half before dipping it back in.
I eat ice cream the same way link does, with leaving half on the spoon and then eating the second half before dipping it back in.
I'm surprised they did bluebell. I thought it was regional. They don't know what a kolache is but they do know bluebell?
The thing you didn't mention was price difference...if there is one. Usually the other styles cost more. At that higher price point, would it still be "good enough"?
In before the notification
#imwithlink
I understand Link! I like to pick my nose and before wiping the booger’s off pick the other side too! So I get leaving some behind 😂
This video just turned into them eating ice cream.. lol!
What a delightful challenge.  Your answers are no surprise to we connoisseurs of ice cream. ;)
Please record your videos with a 4K option!! It would look soooo good
I can relate to the way Link eats Ice cream
Rewatched didn't see him double dip but to be honest his salavia and mouth was on that spoon he didn't clean it everytime so they are still basically swapping germs anyway lol who cares, what haven't they ate together lol
Halfway through this episode I found myself eating ice cream
I always thought it was Bryers.....
whoop whoop, am I right?
pauses to get ice cream from the freezer before watching
I’m a huge blue bunny and Ben and Jerry’s fan!
Wish it was a guessing game
my eating disorder is alive and well so idc what tastes good
I here by stand by Link & the fact he didn't double dip 🍦🍦 Blue Bunny & Walmart brand is the same ice cream products. BoDonkKaDonk.......lord help me 😂😂😂
this should have been one where they guess whats low-cal and normal
I dont like it touchin mah teeth either
Have you tried a bunch of vegan ice cream?:)
This is good to know.
80 episodes!
My husband leaves residue on his spoon when eating ice cream or yogurt... it irks me so much. I lick it clean in one “bite” every time.
Blue Bell is awful to me. Too sticky and plastic with all the heavy corn syrup. The bluebell fans in my family always refuse to even try anything else.
Lol I ran out of Ice Cream and now I’m watching this. 😂 lol
Watching a new ep of gmm + chicken nuggets for dinner = 👍👌👏
I'm with Link!!!! I eat my ice cream the same way he does. Anyone else?
rank non-dairy ice cream!! Do the work for me plz....
I eat ice cream the same way as link ngl 😂😂
You guys should try Graeter’s ice cream, it’s from Ohio and there are stores in like PA and IN now but it’s super good
I’m not really an ice cream kind of guy. I’m more of a frozen yogurt kind of guy, but this video makes me wanna go over to the nearest Baskin-Robbins and get me some good old fashion ice cream!! 🍨🍦🍨🍦🍨🍦
Ok so I rewatched 2 times link didn’t leave ice cream on the spoon then dip.  He tasted waited and finished it.  Even the time he set it on the desk.
That's cold.
Im currently eating ben and jerrys cinnamon bun ice cream while watching and i can say its one of their best flavors underneath half baked
I’m a new viewer and been watch old gmm episodes and it’s weird how links old hair seems more normal than his current hair
I was watching one of ur icecream videos before this. What a coincidence.
one time i found an open condom in my edy's healthy ice cream
That would have been great to do a blind challenge so they can guess which one is less calories and then comment on it.
I want Rhett's shirt
After watching this video, I went and got myself a bowl of ice cream. Red Velvet Ice Cream is what I got 👌
I actually prefer the slow churned Dreyers. It not being so sweet makes it so you can taste the flavor more.🤷‍♀️
“It’s got a low end to it. It’s got a bedonkidonk.”
-Link Neal, 2019
I tried the moophoria ice-cream last week, and I also think it's really good and even tastes like the original. I couldn't taste any difference (it was cookie dough ice-cream for the record)
3:56 not even joking I just finished throwing up
Blue Bunny ice cream is trash hahaha y’all have never had Tillamook ice cream and it shows
“Homie don’t play that” -Link 2019 😂
rhett said he likes a big handed lady
100% fat is always the tastiest.
Doctor Pepper is my favorite soda and the Diet version makes me want to die. So.....theory is busted
Isn’t Rhett lactose intolerant
This should have not been a blind taste test
Rhett, Link, and the Team get me through finals week. Love GMM so much!
Does anyone feel like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel, as of the past two years?
I leave a bit of ice cream on my spoon. But I NEVER dip that spoon with ice cream back into the ice cream. 
That’s disgusting.
first!
#BEGONETHOT! #BEGONE
I eat ice cream the same way
I was kinda hoping they would compare the sugar content since sugar is what creates fat...
I only eat blue bell cause I live in the south
Wow, you just can’t get away from food tasting, eh?  Boring!!
Dairy-free peanut butter cup halo top tastes surprisingly good tbh
I want to see Link with a beard and Rhett with a clean baby face
I wish they had vlogging channels for their personal lives. I’d love to see link mowing his lawn.
Is it just me that thought Perry’s ice cream was well know?
Link you and me are the same with ice cream!
Love you vids and you guys.♥️♥️
I have an idea. Will It Whipcream?
Man I just miss real Icecream. I have to get the non-dairy ones. And sometimes those just taste bad.
Whyyyyy isnt this a challanhe
I do the half bite off the spoon when eating icecream too but I eat the other half off before getting another bite.
If I had a friend for over 35 years, I normally wouldn’t care. But as someone who’s clean and he openly admitted he has herpes, I would have a problem
they should have done it blindfolded or atleast shouldn't know what they are eating.
I too eat ice cream the way Link does. It accentuates the smoothness of the ice cream since you don't come into contact with cold hard steel. Same with yogurt.
I eat ice cream like Link. lol
Who went back to check if Link double dipped beside me?
It’s not as interesting when they don’t make a game out of it
He are marrieds?
That girl annoys me idk why but she does 😂
I feel like she has it out for link ever since the previous LTAT episode.
A residue, is a resi-DON'T!!!! haha I have no clue what commercial that was from, but I always remembered the stupid commercial tag line!
I've only ever had Edy's where I'm at, so when you guys said "Dreyers" at first I thought it was you making fun of some brand by calling it a dry version of Breyers
I do the same thing, Link. Ice cream is way better when you eat it like that.
fat is fine, sugar is not :D
YEAHHHH NEW HAMPSHIRE!!!
I can honestly say I’ve never fought anyone over blue bunny...Ben and Jerry’s and blue bell...completely different story!
early squad how's It poppin'?
Why isn’t it a blind test ?
From dreyers
It's OK Link, I eat ice cream like that too.
Anybody else earing ice cream while watching this?
"Chocolate doesn't add any calories"..... 
Hahahahaha! How I wish that were true
I eat ice cream like Link cause of sensitive teeth yass
Link ‘ba-donk-a-donk’ 😂
Both Ben and Jerry are still alive. Link was thinking of Jerry Garcia, after whom the ice cream flavor was named but actually had nothing to do with the ice cream company.
Rhett doesn't know the difference between mass nouns and count nouns, apparently.
petition for rhett to change his name to ranch bc he's DRESSIN
What three flavors does Link mention at the beginning? Chocolate, vanilla, and cold?
Link put down the spoon with ice cream on it still in round 1 but, he did eat the rest of the ice cream before he redipped. (I watched it twice to make sure and link was fine.)
Well it is kind of weird that his 2:20 spoon is suddenly filled again. That's one with residue that is suddenly rescooped. I think he did the thing.
Save your calories elsewhere; ice cream is a treat that should be enjoyed without compromise.
Love being early to a GMM video. I always get a sense of satisfaction lol
ice cream  not that good yall
Iron man dies
I find Diet Dr. Pepper disgusting and heartburn inducing.
My bunno has a huge cage she sleeps in during the day and I probably spend at least half an hour cleaning it up when I get home every day. Bunbys are destructive little poop machines.
"Will it wake me up with a notification??? lets Talk about that ;) good mythical morning everyone@!!
It's ok Link, i eat my ice cream like that too
I don't know what you're talking about, I literally went back 3X and watched Link eat the ice cream, he licked the spoon clean each time.
I do the same as link. I only eat a little on the spoon
I eat ice cream just like link! Iv done it since I was little and can't stop !
Guest pewdiepie. Like if you agree
I was kinda hoping they would compare the sugar content since sugar is what creates fat...
To anyone looking for healthier ice cream. Dreyers Slow churned is my JAM! Their problem was getting butter pecan, gross. Try the mint cookie! It's amazing. So good!!
They needed to try momas. Ice cream
I hate when people leave ice cream on the spoon 😂😂
Great video as always! Keep up the good work guys. :)
real vanilla ice cream, yellowish and with the vanilla bean inside is sooo good
I eat ice cream like Link :D
I grew up 20 minutes away from the Blue Bunny ice cream capital of the world and I feel personally attacked by this episode 😬😂
Anyone else think of the "that's a ten" guy? No? Just me?
U should try goat milk ice cream because it’s really good 🍦 🐐 ❤️
You guys should do like a Dairy Free food & drink video. For us Lactose intolerant people.
I eat ice cream like link too
If you eat a large amount of the slow churned eadys/dryers, it causes intestinal distress similar to that of sugar free gummy bears. 

Just a fun fact!
PSA link definitely cleaned his spoon everytime
I don’t double dip like link but I definitely eat ice cream by getting the top and then the other half.
I have a serious question, are they gay?
Good Enough or Good is Not?
What is BYMB?
Brand AND flavor must be considered 🤔🧐🍦🍧🍨
11:11
What happened to this mayne being lactose intolerant
I actually eat my ice cream the same as Link. I like to eat half at a time! Represent!
Its delight because its light in fat content.
Dreyers instead of E-D’s?

Why is the like button blue?
Hold on, for two separate 40 calorie differences they listed push-mowing the lawn for 19 minutes and cleaning a rabbit cage for 10 minutes. In what world is cleaning a rabbit cage twice as physically demanding as push-mowing a lawn?
Seeing Rhett eat lactose makes me feel bad gor his stomach since he's already told us him and lactose don't go together. Why does he do it if he's allergic lol.
Rhett Rhett Rhetty rhett rhett
Liek is cool
HAHAHA I eat ice cream and also yogurt just like link does where I just get half off the spoon at a time
zack get your but to the dog
captain america sacrifices himself
@ about 6:19 Was that a member of the crew sneezing? It sounded rather violent . Is Chase okay?
Peh-kawn not pee-can that's what people used to have under their beds because of no indoor plumbing.
Link seems very determined to spread his Herpes. Can't be just his immediate family, but everyone on earth. Herpes is spread more often without a cold sore, whether you want to believe that or not.
Not odd, I also grab a spoon full of ice cream and eat a little bit at a time, off the spoon.
Link always pisses me off when he eats...
HALO TOP!
Woke up really early cause it’s finals week, so I’m trying to get some studying done, but GMM comes first!
Link, I eat my ice cream the same way
I eat ice cream like Link 😪😪
I wonder if y'all noted whether each was labeled ice cream vs ice milk or some other frozen dairy name... Just curious... My dad is picky about his ice CREAM; it can't be ice milk!
My grandparents are friends with the director of Dreyer's
Earliest I've ever been. Only 28 likes.
When you rarely have ice cream cuz ur lactose intolerant 😂
Agree with others that it shouldve been a blind taste test. Ive also had dairy free and vegan ice cream that not only tastes better but is healthier than regular ice cream made with milk.
what are pea cans?
I eat ice cream like Link
“IvE nEvEr BeEn tHiS eArLy BeFoRe”






Want a cookie?
I eat ice cream like link
Can someone tell me what FOSHO means?
I do the same as link when I eat ice cream my teeth  are sensitive too!!
This entire comment section is people talking about wether or not link double dipped
This was a lame episode, no offense.
Mint Chip ice cream is vile
Lowfat is the unhealthy version.
The way Link eats ice cream ..... hmmm
Fire that girl talking and as a goodbye gift give her a link licked spoon
Vanilla ice cream is for wimps who can't handle real flavors. You can't convince me otherwise.
I would eat them all
Link eats ice cream the right way
FYI: Sugar free ice cream will upset your stomach if you eat too much. According to my doctor, our bodies can't process the artificial sweetener. As a result, we get stomach pain if we eat too much.
I eat ice cream the same way link does cause I don’t like it touching my teeth either lol
For some reason, i feel growin tension between rhett and link.
More from rthett, it feels he can't stand link.
They are not focused on the same joke. Link would make a joke ajd awaits for rhett to say smth related to it., But he ignores it completely.
Anyone else watched this while eating ice cream or ate it because you saw this lol
Is mythicality a word???  No, it’s not.
PEEcans
I also eat ice cream off the spoon in at least two bites like link does
I thought breyers and dreyers are the same
Link has a big hand fetish
How many facts does Rhett have up his sleeve? I can only remember 1/2 of a fact..
I have sensitive teeth too and also eat ice cream that way. rake the top, then eat the rest. I agree with Stevie thou... double dipping it is gross lol
Got to disagree.. A "peecan" is more from northern /Yankees.  I'm from the south, and have lived in several southern states, but never heard a pecan called a peecan by someone in the south. Down here, a pee can is what you take to a deer stand when going hunting so that you don't have to urinate on the ground
"im vanilla"
no, no you are not 🙈
I don't even know what to take from this because the only of these brands I've heard of is Ben and Jerry's, and even still, I'd never seen a cherry flavour by them
eating ice cream while watching this episode, i win tonight
I leave a little in the spoon too Link! Just to finish eating it with a second bite because I would never scoop with residue. Dont let them drag us down! We half spooners understand the ways!
5:05 I want to see Rhett & Link Milk a cow , goat, each other ! He He He ! Can Rhett & Link do a Bevis & Butthead Skit and dress like they do ! Please 😂😂😂😂
you know you have stayed up late once you see a gmm notifacation XD
So I love dr. Pepper. It’s my favorite soda. I’ve had regular, diet, and cherry. And diet does not have the same sweetness as regular. Regular is so much better so I’d have to disagree with what Rhett said about it
the whole leaving half icecream on the spoon confirms for me that link is that weird nasty guy who is there to enhance the greatness that is rhett
💜
I do the same thing that Link does, dont eat all of the ice cream on the spoon in one "bite". I Do not dip the spoon back with ice cream on it though.
FIRST!!!
They should do a will it ice cream
why are they hating on how link eats his ice cream. he's not hurting anyone so he should be free to eat how he likes without prejudice :( ...Also, I do the same thing :p
No blindfolds... No giant spoons... What the what guys?? Y'all just 2 dudes trying ice cream... Where's the Love??? Where's the Magic???
MAS MASARAP ICE CREAM KO
don't make fun of link for kissing his ice cream!!! some of us got really sensitive teeth and have no choice >:(
Come on why not make it blind and see what one they like more and guess what one was fat free. this way it can be bias.
That Damon Wayans In Living Color reference.
I eat ice cream the same way as Link, but it's not because of my teeth, I just like it that way
You guys should do the best hershey's chocolate showdown
Can y'all foos stop eating and do something else lol
I leave half of the ice cream on the spoon too, a lot of my friends point it out and think it’s weird lmao
I don’t know where they’re getting their calorie burning stats at but they’re wrooonggg lol. So sitting in a car burns 1 calorie per minute but mowing your grass only burns 2 calories per minute? 🤨🤨🤨 😂😂😂
Taste test Dairy/Lactose free ice creams vs regular ice cream. A lot of time with dairy/lactose free ice cream its bitter or tart, or sometimes just not good. Ice creams though, not sherbet or sorbet
what was the criticism from Jen for? Both Rhett and Link double dipped, and it's only a small bowl of ice cream.
Bluebell is the only acceptable ice cream.
Is pecany a word???  No, it’s not.
It's cuz "de light"
The only people that I have ever heard say peecan, is California people.
Im that guy who always likes your comments to get them higher up... how bout u return the favor 😘
Does anyone know where I can find the t-shirt link is wearing in this episode? I would love to purchase it! Thanks in advance!
Is grandpappy a word???  No, it’s not.
GMM what's the best cereal that milk 🥛taste the best after u eat the cereal
I eat ice scream the same way as Rhett as I don't like freezing my mouth or teeth so i can relate to Rhett response.
Link is such a weird dude with all his mannerisms and habits. Now we have one more weird habit with the ice cream spoon. That takes it up to at least around 2,417 that we've seen. Haha
I milk cows because I’m a historic Farmer and it take 30-45 minutes to milk a cow. Depends on how much milk the cow produces. And the news that I’m loosing calories by milking makes my happy
You should have made them not know which is which
Is sherbety a word???  No, it’s not.
I only eat blue bunny sundaes just saying
Eating a peanut butter chocolate product vs Reese's peanut butter eggs. Omg.. No comparison!
But he did eat the ice cream he left on the spoon on the table, if you watch after he tried the regular one he goes back and eats it. And the one at 2:08 was an empty spoon.
I eat ice cream just like Link... I know exactly what he meant when he said he likes scraping the top off the ice cream! haha
Anyone else eat ice cream like link? 😅
They should have had to guess which one, i think it influences your opinion before even tasting knowing its lower is sugar or fat. As you can see Rhett always has an opinion about the calories before he even tastes it. Lol
I recently learned that Dr Pepper is spicy cherry flavored.  That’s probably why you think it has a medicinal taste.  Because many medicines are cherry flavored.
There's a tiny bit of "residue" left at 2:25 :-)
you should do a dairy free icecream taste test! like halotop soynice etc
Michael McDonald likes the lighter version of Blue Bunny, hence the song “Sweet Freedom”!! 😂😂😂
"I didn't want more than that." Link  <3
The guy in the mythicality wheel intro is cuuuuute : 3
If it were a blind test, I think they would have had the most trouble with Blue Bell. And maybe Cherry Garcia since Rhett liked it so much?
These two baby birded a jellyfish and y’all are worried about double dipping 😂
I'm with Link on he eats his ice cream. I'm the same way.
Blue bunny is just buckets of frozen listeria
Both Ben and Jerry are still kicking
If your going to get blue bunny you don't just get vanilla, they have so many amazing flavors and they always come out with new limited time flavors.
Looking for MORE in your ice cream.  Try Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla.  It has badonkadonk.
I only eat half a off the spoon too Link😅
Was that a Homie the Clown reference at 8:48? If yes... sweet beans.
People in the south pronounce pecan pecon. Only Yankees say peecan
So many companies get it wrong by cutting the fat when it's the sugar that's the problem. The fat is more satiating, creamy, and flavorful.
Did they have cherry brick road howling cow ice cream yet when y’all were at state? Cause I would get that a the bragaw c store just about every day too
Thanos just died
I wish they would use carbs not calories because calories do not really matter
He didn't do it
Also being a Southerner; I have noticed the difference between Pecalns and Peekans. For example : you cannot make a Pecawn pie at Thanksgiving.....It is a Peekan pie. I also have different relatives that get called either Aunt or Ant. It's weird and I've never understood it.
Honestly I need an answer to this, how did they get blue bell in California? I can’t find it anywhere!!! Please help!!!!!

PEE-can is a more east coast thing, more so the further north you go. 

pe-KAHN is the more original pronunciation, coming from the French interpretation of various native american words, and is more common in and around the Pecan tree's native range of Texas/Louisiana/Oklahoma etc.
I actually do the same thing as link with the ice cream 😂
Idk why but gmm is starting to feel like gmm more
Pleases Steve show the reply on LTAT!!!!
Less fat 


More sugar👍
Link mows lawns and munches carpets
I eat it that way too, Link. It magically enhances the experience
ok but I eat ice cream like Link lol didn't know it was weird
I want a compilation of Rhett and Link being Hicks for 20m.
That ice cream moment is going on LTAT
This makes my stomach hurt (lactose intolerant)
Why do they want to change ice cream?  Can't we have anything nice anymore?  Just get the real stuff and go on a walk the next day.
Went back and re-watched it. Only point I could find where Link set the spoon down with some left on it was at 2:30. But he eats it. He did not double dip.
I've always pictured that Rhett and Link are neighbours. Is it true?
How did you get Blue Bell in California>?????
What abt Tilamook!
u do u do u do u do u do
Anybody else think this was going to be a taste test to see if they can ice cree?
Is Rhett still lactose intolerant?
"Now you're speaking my language - lawn mowing" lol never have I heard a more real life King of the Hill type dialogue
"But I will come up big"- Rhett 2019
They should've been blindfolded, gagged, and bound to a chair.
lol I can tell you it takes me at LEAST half an hour to clean my bunny's pen xD
We really take for granted that they upload awesome content every day
We need a ice cream bracket!!!
It seems they ran out of ideas a few seasons ago. But now they hit rock bottom.
I got a weightwatchers ad before the vid. YouTube’s trying to tell me something. 🤔
How come everyone says Dr Pepper tastes like medicine. I don’t taste that
They go through the trouble of getting different spoons at first and then completely ignore them.
6:18 Did someone die?
TASTE TEST TASTE TEST TASTE TEST is that all you guys do now?!
OMG Where Did You Get Bluebell In LA????? I've been looking for 6 years and have yet to find any :(
When I was 5 I thought that the pecan ice cream was caramel
Isnt rhett lactose intolerant?
Why are they not blind testing these anymore
We need this episode again, both as a blind test, and a ranked version to find the best flavor/brand there is
Is mediciney a word???  No, it’s not.
i thought rhett couldnt eat dairy ?
The reason the Bryer's and Ben & Jerry's taste just as good?  they use all natural ingredients.  The Dreyer's and Blue Bunny light have artificial sweeteners to make them low sugar. Which is why they taste nasty.
Link starts to question reality when he says " im not just talking about flavor but nutritional contents too"


Ps that is at 0:38
Omg Plymouth NH!! My hometown!!
Blue Bell>Blue Bunny 
FACTS!!!
ok but if you're strip cleaning a rabbit cage and doing so thoroughly, it takes more then 10 minutes
11:00 Do you know how much a bunny poops? 10-20 minutes of cleaning sometimes...
blue bunny been having recalls a lot lately
they should've tried the vegan cherry Garcia
i don't understand the ratings on this one. the blue bunny was crap, but it was good enough?
I re watched the video and link never dipped his spoon back in bowl with ice cream still on it
I'm really bored with all the taste testing...
But no one only has ONE portion!
I just went down a Rhett & Link wormhole, rewatching old GMM, the jimmy fallon appearances, and I saw Lando's first day on earth. But i was so deep in the wormhole I almost forgot about today's episode haha thank god for youtube notifications
She had man hand. Man hands...
Shut up Stewie
let the man eat his F* ice cream, Stewie.
I do the same thing. I usually take three tries to eat all the ice cream off my spoon, racking the top. But I don't dip it back in, even if I'm the only one eating it.
i like to eat a little off the top too
I’m with link on this one, I eat ice cream the same way
Is it just me or does GMM seem less interesting these days. i have been watching them since 2014 and season 7, 8, and 9 i think were the best. It had the perfect balance of food, games and fact videos, now i feel like its mostly food and some games and they definitely don't have any fact videos these days. I just hope there not running out of ideas they are my favourite channel.
Link i do that with my ice cream to man. My whole family thinks im crazy but a spoonful of ice cream is too cold for my mouth so i eat it in 2 bites...
Thanks for the Billy Joel reference
Should I feel bad for doing the same thing as Link? 
Not double dipping, but leaving some on the spoon before eating the rest lmao
How did yall get Blue Bell out there to your neck of the woods?
Totally dipped the residue
I also eat a spoon of ice-cream by taking the top "layer" off first - for the same reason. I respect your choices, Link :')
I wonder what @YSL is going to do with that?!?  11:41
Half eaten spoon??      DEESGANSTEEN!!!
On an unrelated, related note.. has anyone tried Ben & Jerry's Cinnamon Bun ice cream? It. is. LIFE CHANGING!!
My two worlds just collided! Rhett talking about Grateful Dead jams 🤣🤣🤣
“Homie don’t play dat” haha
as a vermonter, i'm very happy that they approve of healthy ben and jerry's
You burn calories sitting in a seated position? Yeehhhhhhh......
I eat ice cream the exact same way as Link. And I always lick the spoon clean first before dipping again!! I never thought it was a weird way to eat it...
I rake the ice cream off the spoon, too. And then flip the spoon face down onto my tongue for the second half of the bite. Too cold for my front teeth!
i do the rake off the top ice cream eating also. My teeth are too sensitive to touch ice cream
Should’ve guessed which is which
Eating ice cream like link is the only way.
Just want to clarify since it bothers me: neither calories nor fats are inherently unhealthy. Both are absolutely necessary for the body to function. Fats are stored to become energy later; calories are just a measure of the amount of energy you will be able to process from the food. Excess fat is bad, excess calories are bad. Fat is not bad, neither are calories.
I hope someone learns something from this.
8:49 i don’t know why that made me laugh so much. « Homie don’t play that »
I eat ice cream like link too looooool
Sung to the tune of "The Goonies R Good Enough" by Cyndi Lauper.
"If it's, good enough for you then it's good enough for me. It's gooood enough, good enough ice cream!"
Lol one is 1.4L and other is 475ml.
Rhett: "Same amount in a smaller space." . 
He also didn't double dip.
#StopBullyingLink
"I got Jerry Garcia in a pouch maaannn"
damn link gets so pissed and defensive when accused of anything at all lmao
I do the same thing as Link with the ice cream on the spoon. In some way, it's satisfying.
Lmao. I absolutely do the same thing of not taking the full spoon of ice cream for the first bite and never consciously acknowledged it until now. GMM has taught me something about myself this morning. 😂
You guys need to do something with Dude Perfect.
Links shirt is lit
bluebell is the best ice cream
Awwww they didn't do it blind folded haha
his half spoon thing is so weird
i also eat ice cream like link
i eat ice cream of a spoon just like link
I eat ice cream just like Link
Can y’all buy me a rideable lawn mower? we have a huge lawn it takes about 3-4 hours to push mow, and our push mower broke thank GOD but now my father wants to buy another push mower. And he never even mows he doesn’t understand the struggle 😂 pleaseeee
Link, I do that too! I eat the top part of the ice cream off the spoon then the bottom part off. Are we good?
I thought Rhett was lactose intolerant?
Guys, Link double dips around 10:40 . Clear as day. Rewatch if you need to
I do the same as link with the ice cream off the top then the rest of the spoon. It somehow tastes better in a weird, creamier way like that.
Is moophoria a word???  No, it’s not.
Seeing y’all eat Blue Bell made me SO happy because when I lived in CA ten years ago I had no idea what Blue Bell was because it wasn’t available!!!
"I like savory ice cream." -Link, 2019
it's got a bAdOnKaDoNk
A what you call "young" cow takes 160 seconds to milk fully max
I was really hoping this would be a blind test :( I don’t like confirmation bias!
You should do this blindfolded!
After briefly viewing this video for the second time, I didn’t see any evidence supporting the accusation of Link Double Dipping with his “residue” on the spoon. Anyone else?
replays to watch Link's spoon!
Guess the light ice cream
I eat ice cream the same way link does! I have sensitive teeth it helps with that somehow
I do the same thing as Link where I leave a bit of ice cream on the spoon then eat it later... I thinks it's about what he said, enjoying like taking off the top part from the spoon and sorta evening it out
Awwweh I thought they were gonna do it blind
why was this not a blind taste ?
I like a big handed lady haha
Breyers is fake ice cream
That was cringey, looking forward to LTAT
The original ice cream flavors are actually strawberry and vanilla we didn't get chocolate too much later
Okay but like...I eat my ice cream like that
Who the heck eats only one scoop of ice cream?
I would mow the lawn for the blue bell but throw the bunny one in the trash 🤢
why did no one even flinch when link said "the walruses are approaching, and they're HORNY"
On this episode of “Don’t give Link Weapons” Ft. A pencil
The moment you realize Link isn't even trusted with pencils, lolz!
Imagine walking through the gym and there's some dude standing in the corner only doing tongue exercises
We need Kristin Bell & Dax on GMM
She was such a good sport! Another nice guest on the list!
The walruses are approaching... AND THEYRE HORNY 6:13
Does anyone acknowledge the fact that Link called saliva 👅 tongue juice. TONGUE JUICE
"Watch what I do next kids" -Rhett
My family is  looking at me very weird this morning while following along 😂😂😂😂
When they sang happy birthday they sounded like the animals in happy tree friends 😂😂😂
I feel like she looks like if Brook Shields and Mayim Bialik had a baby.
Great guest, very natural 😁
I’m completely ignorant as to who today’s guest was, but I have to say she’s one of the best they’ve had! So funny and involved, she played off Rhett and Link so well! I’m definitely down for more great guests like the ones you’ve been getting lately!
"I can touch my Uvula with my tongue."- Lake Bell 2019. She fits right in.
6:09 "Like a seal mating call. They're coming, the walruses are approaching and they're horRnNyYY" WAHT Link xD
I would've LOVED to see Dax Shepard on here - he would be great sometime! (He's the other star of Bless This Mess). Don't get me wrong - she was super sweet! I would just love to see him sometime as well. :) 
Have a great a day!
“Why didn’t you give him a dull pencil!?” 
😂 they should have thought of that
Links reaction to her saying she doesnt mind licorice... That is my mood towards waking up this early 😂
Please do a conspiracy video with Rhett covering the McRib conspiracy
Lake said to Rhett "you know what, get thru whatever you gotta get thru" then looked directly at his shirt. 🤣😂🤣😂
5:58-6:02  who remembers the Yip Yips on Sesame Street lol?
Lake Bell is effortlessly hilarious! Great chemistry between the three of you.
Link: Saliva = Tongue Juice
“I felt the brain stem pulling” -Rhett McLaughlin 2019 😂😂
“Well thanks for coming, we just killed you!” incredible
It’s crazy how literally I can’t name anything you guys haven’t done already 😂

Rhett and Link and all the crew are awesome 👏🏾
Lake bell is like girl Rhett, or is Rhett guy Lake? Either way they remind me of eachother... They punished themselves because of they're love for dirt candy.
Hi, I just watched an episode from three years ago thinking it was today's episode because it came up in my youtube recommendations...lol
I'm having the best day EVER.
1. Breakfast in bed
2.eating cereal in a cup
3. watch GMM! (in the morning!!)
I loved Lake in the episode! Her personality seemed to really compliment theirs.
You should do a salad dressing showdown! 
May the best dressing win 🥗🏆
Just a couple of fellas making weird noises with their tongues
Nobody:

Almost evryone: I'M EARLY
In college and should be doing work 😂 but nope slowly puts headphones in
Who sang along to America? Just me, at the gym?
Do lactose vs non lactose tatse test please
(¬‿¬) good mythical mornin'
For I sec I thought she was Sandra Bullock and I got so excited... she was great too though. Love it when guests actively engage in the activities rather than being passive
I feel yall 😂😂😂 my name is 
Ansli
And every body goes Kinsli?!?!? 
No maam
Everyone is Commenting I’m early
oh wait I am doing it too XD!
The last one reminded me of the movement the guy from the mummy made when he was making fun of the Egyptian carving (before he was eaten by scarabs) lol. Please tell me someone else always died laughing at this part.
yeah i can stick my tongue back behind my uvula and feel the air pass from my nose down my trachea
"The walruses are approaching! AND THEY'RE HORNY!" - Link Neal 2019
I can lick my nose 

I can lick my chin

And I can lick the bottom of a pudding cup...
Is Rhett's shirt covered in octopi??? I'm in love
Perpendicular: *exists

Lake: I DONT DO MATH!!!
That bonding feeling when you have the same shirt as Rhett. 🤪
"...a bit dodgy." 
i believe the term you're looking for is 'yonic', Rhett.
Lake is a great guest with a fun attitude! p.s. I love Link's surprised, aroused, and nauseous face.
I love the intro songs that rhyme and go with the video

super catchy
Maybe Einstein was doing the tongue brain exercise in that famous picture - that’s the secret! 😮😂
Fun fact of the day: Uvula means 'little grape' in latin
Link is actually a master assassin capable of killing anyone with anything, rumor has it he has killed thousands of men with that very pencil. You don't even want to know what link can do with a spork!
Who else was doing the “exercises” and exercises while they were doing them?


Just me ok I’ll go now
Wow, Lake Bell! Man Up is one of my favorite rom-coms of all time. She's great.
As a professional singer I found this EXTREMELY entertaining!!
Lake is Blake
Rhett is Brett
And
Link is...Blink
I CAN TOUCH MY UVULA WITH MY TOUNGE TOO!!!!! I always thought I was the only one
T O N G U E J U I C E (also just tried touching my uvula with my tongue and I can do it too)
Lake was such a great guest! Really enjoyed this episode
Had no idea who this was, I honestly for a second thought it was Brooke Shields
wait.. so you're really telling me that not every person can touch their uvula with their tongue ??? i thought that was normal lmao
Brooke shields + Steven Tyler lol
I can also touch my nose with my 👅 tongue
I’m in my room drawing (because that’s what I like to do) and flailing my tongue around. 🤣
Im really surprised that Rhett didnt know that first one being a singer himself.
We need to have an episode hosted by cotton candy randy, Damnyell/Richard, and Link😂😂
now i know i have a thing for tongues
totally involved in this video, didn't realize I was trying to do everything they were doing :P
I guess I’m faster than my notifications...
12:23 with no previous context😂😂
"I felt my brain go do like 1/2 an inch!!" Rhett McLaughlin
I have a really tight tongue tie, there is no way I could do most of these 😂
Hi Rhett and Link i saw that you were having a tour this year and i'am actually going to America for the first time and i was going to be in Las Vegas on the 28th June and unfortunately you are performing on the 21st of June. I just wanted to let you know that i would of come :( My sister and i love love love your videos and ive been watching you for years!
Her word of choice was antediluvian. Love it. Deluvian means the Flood.
I can touch my uvula with my tongue
I was doing my homework while doing this and had my pencil in my hand so I played too. lol.
"That's how I counted in gym"
😂😂😂😂
Who else tried this along with them?? Or was it just me?
Link said: like a seal mateing call🤣
On a road trip and so far have been watching great for like 5 hours love you guys!!❤️❤️
I can also touch uvula with my tongue 👍
I legit can touch my uvula with my tongue. I thought it was normal till this video lol
Nobody : 

Good Mythical Morning : PENCIL THROUGH TOUNGE TRICK
Hey! It's my birthday and you guys sang happy birthday to me!
They missed the opportunity to say

“Today we ask the age old question...”
“WHAT THAT TONGUE DO”
“Let’s talk about that”
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) you know where that exercise is gonna be useful
Rhett: "My hair goes up."
Link: "My hair goes up."
I want to read their new book sooooo bad!!!
Gooooood morning beautiful people! I hope you all have an amazing day!☺️
Remember, make sure to LAKE the video and ring the BELL
I woke up specifically to watch GMM!
Every time they have there shoulders together, I always wait for it to be Liza 😭💀
the walruses are approaching
Two things: 
1. I got unnecessarily distracted by the fact that all three of you started the week with Monday and not Sunday 
2. I really interpreted that America the Beautiful one differently than the intended purpose and I think my way was more effective??
I'm addicted to your videos... You're the best youtuber😘
Bless This Mess has been so refreshing!  So nice to have a sit com on TV that's funny and actually safe to watch with your whole family.  :)
I'm quoting my favorite line from every episode, Day 77: "Listen, that did a lot for me" - Blake
Who Else Was Moving Their Mouth Around
There's a fantasy with this woman..lolol
Did nobody else catch "the walruses are coming, and they're HORNY!"
Who else treated this like a workout video?
Link arm stab + slobber injection... congrats Lake, you now got arm herpes. 😬😂😂
I feel stupid for doing it with them 🤦‍♂️
Lake's leaks were fantastic.
I thought title said we cry trazy tounge exercises...
I can touch my uvula with my tongue and my tongue is 5cm from my lip to my chin
I like how no matter what I can count on the Good Mythical crew to always have a video ready for us in the morning 😍
That looked like Red Vines, not licorice.
I don't do math okay. ~Lake Bell 2019
Link saying “That’s how I count at the gym too” absolutely killed me.
I just want to say, Link an Rhett, you each bring your own qualities to this show. Keep it up
Who invited Steven Tyler?
Lake saying "You know what time it is", is the sexiest damn thing I've ever heard.
Haven't laughed this hard in many episodes. 🤣
i still havent watched till the end but i hope you included mewing!!!
“The walruses are approaching, and they’re HORNY” - Link 2019 😂😂😂
I love that Lake almost always pick real. Also who knew there was a part of youtube dedicated to vocal exercises.
Link: Lets speedup.
Lol.
She gets Blake, he gets Brett, I get Brandi, what is with people adding b's to the start of names! :p
why don't they put 'ft. [blank]' in the title anymore?
Lake Bell and Pop Rocks (GMM). Two favorites.
Notification squad wya!!
2:31 Link mocks her for going parallel.
But a second before he does the same thing.
Love you Rhett and Link you guys are my favorite youtubers and I try to watch you guys as soon as I see the notification for your new video.
4:08
Who else was doing it along with them?? 😂🤣
I can also touch my uvula with my tongue
She’s SO GOOD in Man Up
This is one of my most favorite episodes ever. ♥️ they all synced well together
Holy cow, yes!! I admire her work so much.
Also, my dad made me do the pencil thing when I was like four. 
I used to do p.s.a work and call tags for his radio stations.
The last two looked like Gene Simmons at a concert.
if youre not mewing what are you doing
YouTube: This was posted 7 mins ago

Also Youtube: This comment was made 30 mins ago

Me:...
I appreciate the show.
I like your vids but  this video picture is (0)🤮
Lake Bell is kind of cute
Oh boy time to drink some iced coffee while watching Good Mythical Morning before school.
Holy cow! I finally know one of the guests!!!!
"tongue juice" there's a word for that, Link
Rhett and Link can make anything hilarious! 🤣  This really did make me get up and get Zach up haha
Ironically, it was my birthday when this was posted. But I watched this now. FeelsBadMan
link, how are you even capable of making pencil dangerous. you aren't john wick.




right?
Welcome to asmr with some weird objects and tounges
Lake was an awesome guest omg! I hope yall have her back again sometime! <3
‘That’s how I count at the gym too’ was too relatable. 😂
In the mail today i just got the "Rhetts Wonderously Wild Wood 'n' berries" Lip balm! Its AWESOME i love it so much!!!
they should really “act out fan fictions” for a video 😂😂 that would be hilarious
4:36 was my childhood game 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️
The Tounge of the Cobra
It don’t take no for an answer 


Finish the lyrics
t o n g u e  j u i c e
lol it's night right now where I am
With captions there intro is groovy electronic music
Has Link ever won by switching on the last question?
The Happy Birthday was haunting
For a moment I thought one of the cast members from Endgame was going to appear
Coolest Guest They Done Had On The Show 😎
Weird I was just looking up tongue exercises before this was uploaded >.<

I see now I never really got into the embarrassing ones out there 😂
0:55 Rett and Link confirmed to be massive Vampire: The Masquerade players.
I'm all cringed out for today after seeing this...😣😣
Bring back the Unicorn Rap
You only got applauded because you sang the Navy  anthem
13:45
Link... You are the weakest link!
tonguejuice
-when you forget what saliva's called
Can you do will it cream cheese
Rhetts tounge doesn‘t look real😂😂😂
Wish me luck y’all! Flying on a plane today✈️
first time ive eve been early to one of gmm's videos 😂
omg its her!! i love bless this mess!!
Was watching this on slow wifi and the video had to buffer quite a lot, I got to see some pretty epic freeze frames ^^
Now my tongue hurts.
Wait I just tried touching my uvula with tongue and I can do it!
Lake!!!
Love the new show and I'm so happy you have this opportunity.
I've been a fan since back in the Boston Legal days, and when I saw you had your own show I felt like it was deserved and I'm thrilled for you. 
The show is so cleverly done, I wish you all success!!
Awww. Saw "Crazy Tongue Trick Challenge" and was hoping for a ScamNation crossover.
I want meme man Gus Johnson on the show
Try holding the tip of your tongue with your thumb and forefinger and saying "I was born on a pirate ship."
At one point they sounded like the "yep yeps" aliens from Sesame street LOL
You should eBay that pencil Lake Bell used ... I bet it would bring some $$$
I've been in multiple choirs and I'm a vocal coach for children. 😂 
This is funny to see them think what's fake and real
If someone decided to make a Tori Amos biopic Lake Bell could totally play her.
Hmm, and here I thought the tongue was connected directly to the hyoid bone 🖓🤓
Lake now has to get her left arm amputated.
EarlySquad!!!
Just when I thought I couldn't love Link any more then I already do ...He goes and proves me wrong ❤👓🐲🐓
Content kings!!! I absolutely love you guys!!!
4:11
Link is a fricking giraffe
9:03
What a random moment 😂
3 minutes in and I know this is a good episode lol
I felt it pulling on my brain stem, points to cerebellum lol
I can't believe that rhett and link sand happy birthday for me on my actual birthday
I'll be trying these.
inb4 content strike for singing "Happy Birthday"
Rhett: "who's a Lee"
Me: ...
when he said all type of stuff did anyone else go like head game be strong too or is it just me
Ah yes, Link stabbing himself in the back once again. 😏
Brain damage guaranteed everybody your welcomeeee!!
5:28 : 10:09
Rhett and I had the same idea ツ
Did Link have mini stroke at 2:04 lmao 😂
I have a History final in 4 hours and I stayed up all night...Help....
Tongue juice? What's that lol ✌
Literally the earliest I've ever been on a video :O
That’s how I count at the gym!😂
This has made my day 👏👏
Link: “ that’s how I count at the gym too.”
I actually watched before school for a change. :) I'm usually too tired. Good Mythical Morning everyone! I hope you all have an amazing day!
Why does Link always have to sabotage himself by choosing the opposite of what Rhett does, all in an effort to get ahead? It never works 🙈
On the second one I tried it 2 and I gagged
Time to make it 667 comments
This one is funny I did laugh 😂 a lot
I involuntarily had my mouth open and tongue out the entire video
man you really cant give Link A N Y form of a weapon lmao
I should be studying for finals but I’m on a GMM and hot ones roll
LMAO 6:10 You can see Rhett put his head down in reaction to Link's comment on seal mating calls.
Love Lake Bell! Awesome on Boston Legal!!!
Ah yes, the tongue exercises have many uses 😈 honestly I don’t realistically see and other use for this lol
12:23 why can’t I stop laughing 😂 🤣
Lake didn’t really do any of the exercises right😂
hey link... i know a crazy tongue exercise we can do together...
Now Supernatural has had its season 14 finale I’m gonna try and to get to Misha Collins and ask him if’s ever go on this show and maybe even let West and Madison cook w/ Josh...they could bring Shep and Lando!!! That’d be FANTASTIC!
Okay, so when you look up "spit" in Link's dictionary it says: "tongue juice". Interesting :)
the thumbnail is a classical panel from hentai
Yes... Mouth warm ups to get your mouth around words like Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
This is the first GMM game where I actually knew all of the answers. 
Hey guys! I found the thing my musical theater degree prepared me for!
" We never get aplauded " after getting aplauded for america the beautiful.... i think no more words are needed to portray my thoughts as a non american there  xD
OMG.....LAKE BELL!!!!  Loved her ever since she was in Surface.
i tried touch my uvila and i vomited
B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S WILL YOY BLESS THIS MESS
lake is so pretty!!!
That's just a table tennis racket
8:01 Did he just called her Link? :D
Link is so dirty! 😂😂
The clips of the “pros” made me SO uncomfortable
Rhett’s tongue is weirdly cute
Happy World Penguin Day
This episode made me uncomfortable for some reason
i keep checking for that adams apple
Rhett has entered the TMJ Gang
Morning of good mythicalness
She Looks like Brook Shields!
Lake was an amazing guest!
Y’all running outta ideas?? 😭😭
I'm so early I beat my notifications
Lake.....link......





Lunk?
Where the Early Squad at?
My Morning tongue exercise is licking lollipops
I cant touch my uvula with my tounge also :-)
They get almost to the end, and set themselves up for the copyright strike.
There are just guests that have a natural vibes and humuor as Rhett and Link
As soon as i saw the title, i thought of mewing. Been doing it. My jaw hurts.
Love gmm but this ain't it.
Ah yes, the tongue juice, aka spit
Can we get a "Crew Cam" when they were doing Happy Birthday?
I didn't realize being able to touch your uvula with your tongue was something not everyone can do until seeing this.
okay...lake bell is such a beautiful name
I tried this. My dog ran over and smothered my face with hers to either say are you dying or STFU
link really did the absolute most in this episode lol...
Lake Bell will always be Nancy Patterson to me
(I love the movie Man Up)
😂 I can touch my uvula with my tongue too lol
never been this early :O
Is there some kind of curse that happens if you watch the more first?- just asking for a friend
Gene Simmons would have been a perfect guest for this episode.
Lake Bell said Shi* at 6:39
MAKE AN EPISODE WITH BILLIE EILISH
ahegao


°~°
you're lying if you say you didn't play along
Anyone else realize that in 2039 we might be watching their kids
Good evening where I'm from! Good morning to the rest of you mythical beasts!!
What if her and drake bell got married 🤔
Lake was a great guest, they had good chemistry together.
11:39 wow link is mad
U should try to get demolition ranch on ur show or onepuglife
ITS MY BIRTHDAY 🎉🎉🎊🎉
Rhett’s brain move 1/2 an inch each clap. Rhett’s brain is now 7 1/2 inches lower in his skull than it was at the start of the episode. This is a medical anomaly
FOSHO my dudes
if there was ever an episode pewds or gene simmons should guest in
6:10 Link, what on earth?
The "happy birthday" thing made me cough.....
I freaking love Rhett and Link
My tongue aches just by watching video😋👅
Happy birthday ceiling!
“That’s how I count at the gym too”
We need Dax next time! It would be hilarious!
Why did the intro remind me of the vocal warm up "The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tounge"?
No, the walrus r jumping of cliffs🤣(smoshcast reference)
I DIDNT SLEEP
😍😍😍 I love Lake Bell!!!! What a nice surprise
I don't have one of those magical uvulas.... Stuff gets in my nose all the damn time! Hahahha maybe I should try some of these tricks :)
Who else did this with them the whole time? 😂
Lake Bell, what a team player. Good for her. She seems really cool
Looooove Lake Bell! This is definitely my new favorite episode
Videos always come out at 5:03 am lol
Lake bell? heiress to the taco bell empire!?!
"Watch what I do next kids"- Rhett
I'm watching you guys so time can past by quicker on my fortnite update
“this is a tuffy”
Where’s Rhett’s young pillow
Best part of the morning
Wow! Gg! Love ur show!
Lol it’s time to get that tongue SHREDDED😂😤





As a youtuber I talk a lot so I need this
Lake is my favorite guest you ever had on the show, and I didn't even know of her before this! This was really fun to play along too, get all the weird out lol
wow they did not put FT. LAke bell
One of my favorite guests! She’s so natural and pleasant and seems like she genuinely had a great time! ❤️❤️❤️
9:59 link: my chin is wet from the... tongue juice
Never clicked off of sleeping so fast.
They need to get a cast member from Marvel on here sometime! That would be so much fun!
good morning, mythical beasts :)
5:48
 no one:
Me: why does this remind me of that one scene in Finding Nemo?
5:58 Sesame Street aliens!!
"they're coming! the walruses are approaching! and they're HORNY "
The arsonist has oddly shaped feet. The human torch was denied a bank loan.
I love how mad link gets when Rhett wins! Haha
Why did they start the week count in challenge two on Monday?! 😂
That America the Beautiful harmony tho!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼😍😍
not gonna lie, almost watched the more first, because of the thumbnail lol
10:37 I can get pretty far back
Lol I also thought everyone could touch that thing in the back of your throat 😂
Y'all need Dangmattsmith on here
at 4:06, link looks like gene simmons
"Uploaded 51 seconds ago" ah thats nice :]
When the guest thanks you for being in your own show and welcomes you
W-waiT someone else named after a body of water??? im shocked omg
I'm starting to lose my sleeping pattern that  I set my alarm for 3:00AM.
"Oh that's hot" - Kanye 2018
Link ia such a cheater
Lol what was with link and arousal today 😂
Kinda lame episode but I gagged just watching this
lake’s jawline so sharp i cut my finger looking at it
THIS VIDEO WAS TONGUEALICIOUS! 👅
Rhett: "Just someone with a YouTube channel who thinks they're an authority" 
Most of GMM.
She mispronounced antediluvian.
Another episode i gotta skip:/
It's so great to see them interact with someone their own age. No awkwardness, no weird distance-keeping... she just fits in seamlessly. It's like the internet dads and their sister, the vodka aunt! 
She is great too! Really dynamic, witty and a good sport! :D
Does anyone ever play the guitars behind you or are they just for decoration? I really need to know, PLEASE respond.
Two Friends with Engineering Degrees making the world laugh with tongue exercises.... priceless.
This episode made me laugh, no joke.
Hi from Mexico lol
Gotta watch this before going to sleep. #nightowl
Not sure how I feel about going into this episode with that thumbnail.
I’ve never tried before, but I also just realized I can lick my uvula.
I bet she can fit 999 "things" in her mouth at once 😂
Since when was Steven Tyler a girl?
Here before the notif-
Sees number of views and comments...

Never mind :|
How do you keep finding people I've never heard of? You could drag someone off the street and tell me they're semi famous and I'd believe it as much as any of these people. XD
Ok so when I first heard about Lake Bell I was convinced it was Drake Bell in Disguise.
I know a tongue exercise Rhett can do 😉😝🤤
man Lake Bell was ready to go down on that pencil right away haha
"Happy birthday to the ceiling."
It's the opposite to "Happy birthday to the ground !"


:-D
Beat my notifications
Nice one, Link 09:51
Noobtastic King
TONGUE OF THE COBRA!
From the thumbnail I thought the pencil went through links tongue
They’re straight up targeting link with that punishment 😂
Imagine everyone watching this doing this in there rooms. Literally thousands of people
That second exercise made me stick out my tongue without realizing it...
wait I thought everyone can touch their uvula as well
Lake is an actual gem!!!! I will fight anyone who says anything negative about her.
Definitely have Lake Bell back, she was great!
OH MY GOD IT'S LAKE BELL! I absolutely love you in Childrens Hospital and ...In A World!
The last exercise looks like jabba the Hutt choking
The moment you realize Link is picky in all the same ways you’re picky. Picky tastebud soul mates. Licorice is 🤢
I knew tge first one bc my dad was in the radio and taught me how to do it:) and that if your in the radio you have to do it
Hi welcome to another CrAzY episode of TONGUE TRICKS this ePiSoDe we have the SPECIALEST guest OF ALL TIME
I think Lake and I are the same person. I can do all those things too. Haha
Rhett: "I am Rhetty"
The clapping is for timing.
Would love to see Becky Lynch back on as a guest again, maybe for a food episode!
10:50 I can  to
2:48 perfect chorus guys applause
Don't you just love three people wiggling their tongues around?
Every time I go to watch an episode and enjoy myself, and I see them glued together like kindergartners who found a giant bottle of super glue, I instantly click off and pout for 12 seconds and then move on with my day.
You are 18 plus rated show lately 😳
5:19 - You're welcome
Lake is hilarious! I loved this episode 😂
This is the show where people with new shows go
6:00 a bunch of sea gulls
I unconsciously kept my toungue out the entire time! 👅
Also, waiting for my toddler to wake up and realized I'm totally copying the exercises 😂
Good Morning @GoodMythicalMorning Crew from "Fedville" North "Caroliner".
Imagine being invited to a show where ur gonna do tongue exercise...
Im at 9:28 i paused to say this I THINK ITS REAL i did the SAME thing in choir to relax the tongue and mouth except without the clapping :3
Does tongue exercises:


Tongue gets completely JACKED!!
I love it when guests are just so game
Love her as a guest!!
Great video today I love the video
i guess after a series of taste tests,
the masters have to train their tongues for more.
Anyone 6:00 am
Who else Liked the old intro more
I will from now on refer to spit as tongue juice. And I would most definitely dislocate my jaw with that one exercise
The pro demonstrations all look like absurdist art clips.
No more pencils for Link he can't be trusted with  them  just like knives🔪
Loved Lake on this
Love you Rhett and Link ♡😂
GOOD MORNING!!!
they've fineally lost it
Lake is a seriously funny and talented lady! Actress, writer, director, producer. She does it all!
The happy birthday one everyone looked like newborn baby birds begging for food 😭
I can also touch my uvula with my tongue!!
Is there a compilation out there for every time Link gets mad because he lost? I think its hilarious! hahaha
got to try harder than that - the meta show
WHO IS SEEING AVENGERS ENDGAME
“The walruses are coming, AND THEY’RE HORNY” - link neal
I like her ! she has a charming quality about herself! Bring her back !
Link literally can’t be trusted with anything
I CAN TONGUE MY UVULA TOO 😂
I never realized how uncomfortable tongues made me feel until i watched this video
Waiting for Brendon Urie to be a guest star..
Who else did it with them lmao
This was a miss for me!
Surprised they didn't get copyright stricken with that rendition of America The Beautiful
she said, "Let's talk about that" very seductively lol
Only old fans will remember the old good mythical morning intro!
Another guest I've never heard of before but my girlfriend has & dang was she incredibly lovely
Ok y'all I felt so special i met the girl wresler that was in the shiw last week I freaked out was i over dramatic😂😂
I can't be the only one trying these exercises while watching them do it!
Does anyone remember Link can lick his elbow. Was wondering if he was gonna bust out that trick when they were licking their nose
Thanks for bringing the old glasses
Is link a giraffe?
Demonetized for happy birthday song. Copystrike
You know the saying never stick you're tongue out unless your gonna use it😂😂 btw rhett your tongue is giantic how do you fit it all in your mouth😂
Hi I love your video s!
That's not liquorice!
I was just watching some of their other videos
Any other speech-language pathologists sitting through the whole thing hoping they would do the Masako maneuver?
I can touch my uvula with my tongue too glad to know someone else can😁
copyright strike because they song the happy birthday song
This is why you don't change your answer Link
12:35 what has GMM become? Haha.
All comments made before this one have not watched the full video
The tongues out with head tilted back is a gif!
Anyone doing the exercises with them beside me?
Is she the "ironic" girl from New Girl that Nick can not figure out?
i used to live in gulf shores and i know EXACTLY where they were lol
every time they say tip of my tongue i think of patrick stump’s part of i’ve been waiting
Lake Bell was a great guest! She brought some good energy to the show and it'd be cool to see her on again.
I love it when they get you to do things that make you guys do hilarious stuff
GMM has gotten really risque this season!
Who else did the tounge tricks along with them?
Morning guys!!
Look at the size of this womans mouth!!! Looking like Steven Tylers sister!
Anyone watching before school?
You guys should try vaping
I thought she was so weird that she could touch her tongue to her uvula but I just tried and I can do it too. Lol
How many immediately Google the definition to anti diluvian?
How to make perfectly sane people look insane lol
My tongue is well exercised. ;)
Lake Bell related to Drake Bell? Hmmmm....
Omgg miss you gulf shores 😥
These tongue exercises are tongue twisting!
gang mythical morning
“In A World...”
Love you guys. Ur my favs
Please put ft. on the tittle and save me a click.
Finally you guys merged a good guest with an appropriate game.
This is a great episode!
Lake Bell is soooo good in Childrens Hospital!
Who is singing the GMM intro?
I actually did that singing exercise when I was in choir...
Aww, Link had two separate distinct opportunities to retell his Bell Beefer joke, both with Lake, and since she's on the new show with Dax.
12:53 was that almost a super sneaky 's' bomb?
Thats totally a dude
Antediluvian. Not antidiluvian.
I GOT THIS AT 3AM
link's comment about the walruses at 6:16 lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤👌👌
Okay like frfr you need to start adding “Ft. _____ “ on the title
Li is my daughter :)
New tv show on nick staring lake bell and josh nickels
347th comment
First time hearing of Lake Bell. She's quite entertaining lol.
Good morning!!
Good morning!!
Been a fan of Lake since I saw In a World. She's fantastic.
Anyone else think she could play Steven Tyler in the Aerosmith Biopic?
The happy birthday exercise was straight out of a nightmare
Brett and Blink
It Should of been Riley reid
Its my bday 😍😍😍
Just because some "vocal teachers" do something on youtube doesn't make it a real effective exercise. Get a grip girl.
Young Mike Jagger?
...and I thought everyone could touch their own uvula :P
In choir, I actually learned you're not supposed to stretch your vocal chords by tilting your head back. It can damage them and give you a sore throat. Plus, it puts strain on your trachea which makes it more difficult to breathe properly
Rhett's tongue looked fake when he was counting to twenty
Who else is doing these exercises along with them?
Oi Rhett why did u rage about ur chair in that one vid like five months ago?
They should have brought Riley Reid
So Lake bell is a dude pretending to be a chick?
I can touch my lluvia too
I can spoil the whole infinite wars movie I seen it early because I work at the movie theatre
My names Clayton and they mistake it for Blake far more than you would think.
Avengers EndGame comes out tomorrow
“i feel like my chin is wet from the tongue juice”
TONGUE JUICE
I feel like that would make the ritual of the happy birthday song a lot better, if we stuck our tongue out and sung to the ceiling
Antediluvian: Before the flood. People aren't aren't of this? Oh, wait, I'm just a LARP nerd...
wow i’m actually watching GMM in the morning😂
She has perfect teeth
She looks like Steven Tyler :D or to put it differently, Steven Tyler looks like a woman :D
16th LOL
6:39 i'm just sayin
I miss the old good mythical morning 😭
wow i'm here immediately
Hey yall!
Can you spell, BORING?
They actually comb their hair like this on purpose lol 😂 love it!! This is the best show ever on the internet or otherwise!!!
Lake Bell was hilarious on Children’s Hospital
2:42 My last 3 brain cells during the test
yay.... early...I think
Good mythical morning :)
Link you can be a goofy.
Who else tried these while watching
Rhett has quite the striking tongue 👅
But the tongue isn't actually attached to the brainstem... There are only cranial nerves leading from the brainstem to the tongue.
13:13 Link was digging into Rhett.
they should also have haley pham and ryan trahan on gmm
Last time I was this early I realized I had no life.
Lake was great!!!
Guys this is such a bad video😣😣😣😣
Rhett and Link sit super close to each other They must have a guest!!
I am going to be dead by dawn
the week starts at sunday -_-
Gooood mythical morning I almost saw it first but then I fell asleep
Did anyone else do all the exercises with them?! Haha
I can only ever see her as Nick Miller's girlfriend...
Great episode! Was this named "Secrets of Professional Singers" before it was named "We Try Crazy Tongue Exercises"? That's how it popped up in my subscriptions.
Is that true, that not everyone can touch their uvula with their tongue? Can anyone corroborate? I've never considered that it might be a unique trait.
Dull pencils another thing to add to the list of things link can't have lol
Has anyone else just noticed rhett and link take turns putting their face in the thumbnail?
Lol that looks like Steven Tyler’s daughter...half dude
Oooook...
Nothing like watching three adults sticking their tongues out and counting
8:38 Man Link. One point ahead of both of them, if they guess identical then you can lose that round.
Wait, so not everyone can touch their uvula with their tongue???
Nearlyfirst
Okay guys you got me back
i loooove lake bell baby looks like she smoked a j in the parkling lot right before tho i love it
How is it decided who gets to say it’s time to spin the wheel of mythicality
Your tongue is NOT connected to you brainstem
i love Lake Bell, she is so funny!
These help when I'm too lazy to eat.
Roses are red
Violates are blue
I stayed up till 3am
And so did you
When she said she could touch her uvula with her tongue i tried it and felt something weird i thought it was like a bubble from my spit or something soft so i looked in the mirror at a very weird angle and i was touching it with my tongue omg
This is not what I thought the episode was about, I saw the thumbnail and thought it was about illusions and thought the pencil was going through his tongue
5:33 Rhetts expression, lol
I see you have become the try guys
I can lick the top of my nose with my tongue
I felt like Rhett really wanted to mention something about him getting his "lil fellers" out with his tongue when Lake mentioned the uvuvla tongue thing
Mr. Neal is a gifted person.
#NoMoreGuests
Thank God I'm not watching this in public
Good morning!😁
Tongue exercise for what
Lake Bell? Does she know Drake Bell?
I guess I'm early
We need a new Pewdiepie episode!
I can also touch my punching bag in my throat with my tongue
6:12 nuff said
Good morning 🌄
wow, drake bell!
How did I know Rhett was going to say CAREFUL in response to the wheel of mythicality fan video?
You guys should do the "Korean fire noodle challenge "
fun fact about liquorice: you can get diarrhoea from eating it
Their wife’s might reap the benefits of this video😉
4:18 ed edd n eddy
wow shes beautiful
I loved links face while he was trying to touch his nose with his tongue
What an awesome guest 🙌
Brett, Lee and Lake are great singers
First comment
I need a friend named Lake.
Who thought giving Link something sharpe was a good idea
you guys should do the whats in my hand challenge!
So did you guys just have a giant licorice stick laying around, or...
WTF .. when Rhett felt something dislocated in his jaw I tried to make the move myself and I think I experienced the same exact thing that he did .. wtf happened xD
Rhett, swallowing your tongue is not possible.
4:19 Rhett looks like a puppet when he sticks his tongue out.
crazy!!
I can touch my uvula with my tongue
I can touch my uvula with my tongue
is the tongue a muscle itself or does it have muscles in it?
I am also a Brett at all parties
I love her and I love that show!!
Early gang
4th comment
So tik tok thots are just trying to stimulate there brain
I can touch my uvula with my tongue too.
I can’t do this stuff because I am tongue tied
I'm not gay greg
good morning from Canada
Her tongue is so pointy!
i dont know how after all these years they've never noticed that the first question in these games happens to always be real.
I can touch my punching bag too!
6:13 in what way ?
Does Noah still work at gmm anyone? Cause I don’t know.
They all try to share the licorice  and in the end, no one was  a winner.
Huh. I can touch my uvula with my tongue too. Didn't know it was that strange.
Daaaamn that lady must be tall!!! She seems normal but then think how tall Rhett and Link are!
We all know Rhett and link didn’t really need the lyrics to America the Beautiful after singing it a million times on the road trip to Cali 😂
Was it just me or did Lake Bell look like she was lip syncing half the video?
My name is Ryan, but I'm constantly called Bryan... I've stopped correcting people I'm never gonna see again, too tiring, haha.
You know those movie scenes where something weird or paranormal happens? 2:43
Rhett in the streets, Brett in the sheets
Today is my birthday. So I was very happy that they did the Birthday song with their tongues. 😝😄😜
To relieve tongue tension.... wtf
Today's my birthday and you sang Happy birthday 😆😆. What a coincidence 😂
Wow I can totally touch my ugliva too! I thought it was normal 😂 I can stick my tongue past it even.
Careful, not to Twist your tounge!
I wanna sleep....
Like Lake singing voice.
People can't touch their uvula with their tongue? I thought everyone could...
Please get Esme Creed-Miles from the new Hanna show =)
Oh no! Pencils too? 3 seconds in and link stab the guest with the pencil, another thing in the list of the link can't use
How did you persuade Tom Cruise to put on a wig?
Good mythical night australians
I can touch the back of my throat with my tongue and put my tongue behind my soft palate!
6:38 busted
They were better than the instructor
I'm a Brett at all parties..."but your a Rhett today" That's what matters
3:30 am  let’s do this
lake could actually die from swallowing her tongue
She reminds me of Hari Nef
Lake and Rhett look like they could be siblings.
I too can touch my uvula with my tongue and push my tongue behind it
My last 2 braincells at 3 am
I like how she goes straight to sticking it in her mouth haha 😂
Do they film each episode really early in the morning or do they film it the night before and just post it early let me know
isnt the bday song copyright, careful boys
Looks like I’m in love with Lake Bell now
Lake was a great guest! Funny, smart, great comedic chemistry with the guys, and she seemed totally into the game and being on the show.
I’m a Bret at every party I go to as well
Wow have they grown ^^ all these people already watching
And here we are again the mystery continues lol why on earth are some people "featured" and others not. Just mind boggling... its gotta be like something that just get asked for in negotiation when they are gonna be on the show and if it isn't asked for it doesn't happen. To be clear i have no qualms with it i just wanna understand the dichotomy of the situation lol
She said a bad word at 6:39
my name is landry, i get andrea all the time...
People have a lot of free time to be pro in tongue exercises
Why does Rhett scream 'whaaaaaaaaat' when someone says Tokyo?
imagine if the avengers came here
It's my birthday tomorrow😊
Lake is so funny
Thats the Exercise i do every morning instead of going into the gym
LAKE!!!!!!
She is so good in Wet Hot American Summer
#lakebell
Good morning everyone! Hope y’all have a good day! 💜
Every time I see other guests on the channel besides Rhett & Link and their staff....... I click off automatically. I might come back to the video later but at that moment I just don't care seeing anyone but Rhett & Link. Idk about anyone else, but that's just me. Lol
12:25 Good Mythical Morning ladies and gentlemen
Could abc have come up with a more basic name for a show?
2:50 not to be weird but it was kinda cute after link hurt her he like checked her arm to see if she was okay i know he's married but it was kinda cute it reminded of a korean drama moment lol
why.... am i doing these exercises too, as they say the instructions....?
16th yay
I don't usually like guests, but she was really natural doing it all, I almost forgot she is not there all the time with them
Good mythical morning. I just ate 😅😅😅. Comment if you can figure out where I'm from.
lake bell
So many guests from tv shows that do not exist now but GMM keeps pressing on
9:03 you’re welcome
6 dislike
Can I have that guitar back there?
Guys....if you have a guest on your show please LET THEM FINISH THEIR SENTENCES!
🤣
Who tried these exercises
Giving Link a pencil could have “lead” to some dangerous situations.  I would try to erase him stabbing Lake from my memory, but I don’t see the point.
Good Mythical (3 in the) Morning from Seattle!
Lake is funny and a good sport and I hope they have her back as a guest soon.
You should do an episode of of "will it" staring different kinds of banquet pot pies
My boyfriend is named tanner and he has been called Tyler and things close to that then randomly someone thought he said his name was Adam. Like not remotely what so ever!!!
Again, I side with Rhett. Back when ppl were trying to figure out ways to scam ppl out of money someone thought they’d charge ppl to talk to their dead relatives but since that was already taken they thought they’d tell everyone that these silly things would improve tongue strength. 🤷🏼‍♂️ That’ll be $19.95, thanks. 😄
Tonguetastic.
my queen
I can do that uvula thing too
Is she the one in the pumped up kicks video
Goooood mythical morning have a great day🤗
what that tongue do though?
I can also touch my uvula
If only we didn't have the context...
You know what would be funny, if nobody clapped when they welcomed someone. Actually it's not that funny now that I'm typing it...
Is the yellow spots on their faces make up or is it the camera or.. something else? - Concerned viewer
Woah, I've never been here so early! Good mythical morning everyone! Go make someone smile!
Just a bad episode
Also... three words for you. =Hotdog Eating Contest.




I want them to do that it would be fun. Yay!
I always get a little worried when there’s a guest on GMM, because sometimes they just don’t have the right personality for the show and it becomes more awkward than entertaining, but Lake is definitely the right kind of personality! She was great! The right guests certainly make the show even better. Hope to see her back again someday.
That jaw shift is tmj waiting to happen
I guess I’m early the 427th comment,.,...the 2.7kth like.....
Wet hot American summer
is this the twilight zone
is this the twilight zone
Rhett and Lake
I my be wrong, but isn’t perpendicular at a 90 degree angle to the line whereas parallel is in line with the line (though never touching)?
weirdest episode yet
I know where that Ferris wheel is!
I have a friend who can stick his tongue behind his uvula and into his sinus cavity!
they should do weird singing exercises
Are you saying that not everyone can touch their uvula with their tongue?
Didnt know who Lake was til today but i think she was a great guest and is so cute!
Y does she look like Steven Tyler???
I know how this training would help
You guys are just awful. Do an episode "will it milkshake" with cyanide capsules.
first?
pulling on rhetts brainstem is by far the dumbest thing he has said in the history of this show
I saw her in New York last year
I would love to be able to sing but I am NOT about to do ANY of these ridiculous exercises
They must be runing out of content because this is stupid😂
The exercise where they stick their tongue and move their jaws back and forth is a real exercise. The lala part is fake but I have to do this exercise for physical therapy
I'm going to start being more critical of GMM. This was not a funny episode. Normally, I just say, "Oh well, it was a flop day." But at what point can we expect more than a good episode a week?
Ummm that a dude?
I kinda known that chick?
Rhett in the streets, Brhett in the sheets
Omg she looks like a older version of Sabre in the Norris Nuts channel go check them out :)
I'm a Lee
I actually thought she was English when I saw her in that movie with Simon Pegg (I really like that movie but I can't remember the name)
Every morning I wake up wondering what Rhett and Link have in store next, I'm amazed about everytime, love it!
As a neuroscience student I cringed when she said because the tongue is connected to the brainstem part 😬😬
im scared
Rhett and Link are one of the few reasons I don't wanna die.
I can touch my punching bag with my tongue too. Is that really a hard thing to do? Omg do I finally have a talent???
FIRST
Why does Rhett's tongue look blue?
Yay no food
Ily guys
Stupid episode....
This is so weird.
she has a face Mr Ed would love
avengers end game tommorow
Sunday is the first day of the week
Today I learned I have a small tongue.
Lake Bell is funny and awesome. I used to just know her as the other Mrs. Adler from It's Complicated but she's so much more. Ha!
rhett's tongue stops looking like a real tongue after a few minutes and its weirding me out
the problem with this one, is its not a game of whether its real or made up. it's did the gmm crew make it up or did some other person make it up?
first
you guys look like dorks
bad episode
Yayyy
Lake has a voice like melted chocolate, i could listen to her read the phone book
The penalties and prizes are getting kind of lame. I understand that ideas don’t come from no where, but I still think they could come up with something.
I’m a Lee , Brhett.
Rhett rages about his chair? what was that about?
“The tongue is directly connected to the brain stem” Uuuh no it isn’t lol
The tongue is the strongest muscle in the human body 😁
Great host!!
The tongue is not directly connected to the brain stem....
oh man i loved this woman on that show children's hospital it was hilarious
I thought Lake Bell was the fantasy trans name for Drake Bell.
Um actually... As a person who was in speak therapy in elementary school. The exercise where you move your tongue from side to side is actually real. But they always made us balance smartys candy on our tongue as we did it and we said the alphabet not repeat 'lah'.
6:15
First
First
Good Mythical Morning fellow mythical beasts!!!
5:44
The words should have been “tongue stretched or far fetched” instead of true or false
It can't tell youth why, but this gal bums me out.
Anyone else tongue tied, and biologically can't do any of these?
That wasn't liquorice. It looked like strawberry candy. :o
When Rhett thinks the tongue is actually attached to the brain stem 😆😆😆
107th
She was right in the way she put the pencil perpendicularly
11th
Can you post the links to the videos you guys shared in this episode??
💛❤💛❤❤💛
I haven't even been to sleep yet and here I am. Lmao
If Brooke Shields and Sandra Bernhard had a daughter. 🥰
i hate when the guests have to leave before GMMore
6:13
Who else had their own tongues out when they were doing the tongue exercises...
Good vid
I’ve met her before!
also good exercises for lesbians
hey guys y did u abandon rhett and link
🤠 good mythical mornin 🤠
Do an episode on the disasters throughout history in April. "April showers bring Mayflowers, Mayflowers bring Pilgrims, and Pilgrims bring disease and death, and where does it all trace back to? April." There's your opening quote right there.
💖💖💖💖
👏
12:24 looks like a horror movie
its a trap
writing is going downhill
Good memeacl morning
Why did Gav and Dan trust Link with a sabre if he can't be trusted with a pencil?
The only thing my tongue gets is food and drinks.. Not toothpaste, not exercises, y'know XD
she looks like connor (female version) from detroit become human
Why does Link reminds me of a young Morrissey (leadsinger The Smiths)?
Next time let’s get Drake Bell on the show guys
Early af😎
I can also touch the back thing on my mouth with a tongue
GoodMorning bro
Skereeeeeee
Why did they stop including "Ft. ___" in the titles?
2:12 she said what??? 2:25 shes about that life
Interesting
get Katy Perry on the show!
Hey Rhett and link, I have an idea for your next will it, and this idea is inspired by your will it deep fry, this idea, is will it airfry , aka rotisserie
They should try normal ice cream vs halo top ice cream or healthy ones
yay gmm
Any sharp object is dangerous when Link holds it, even a pencil
3...2...1...AD.
Im a lee
Lol🤣💜👍 Now please bring Dax Shepard!
She looks like a man but still she sings good
Rhett looks like the Musical Jolly Chimp from toy story three at 9:39.
It should’ve been with exercise is real and which is a myth
Hi
I like dat chique!
Ohhh im kinda disappointed...I thought they were gonna try to do actual tricks...like rolling your tongue sideways or folding it in three....
Scream
NERDS!!!
Yay more eps without "Ft. ____" in the title. What happened guys? You did it last time...
That is what you call a weird challenge video :)
I can’t stop eating
This is just sad. It’s have officially ran out of ideas
Is that a boy ?
Is that a boy or girl?
Top notch guests u guys have been getting 👌🏼. The guests have been very fun & entertaining......plus I’ve heard of them! 😃
anyone know if lake bell is transgender? so happy wiyh the LGBT community
Rhett worded it wrong. It’s not perpendicular to the tongue. It’s parallel
Whoa
😝
Is mythicality a word???  No, it’s not.
I’m girlfriend loves when I do tongue exercises
That honestly looks like a bunch of flamin hot churros attached to each other
Does anyone know of these tongue exercises actually work?
Rhett’s tongue doesn’t look right
3rd
Why don't you guys put "ft. (guest)" in the titles anymore?
How about a song for when you dont want to go to work but you need money for cold sore medicine.
Is it just me , or did this have a different title early this morning ? Coulda swore it was “Secrets from professional singers” or something like that
At vidcon😁
Now the mythical team can't even give link a pencil
How do you know when youve stayed up too late? When a GMM notif shows up
My gf sent me this for some reason
imagine being hammered @6am and seeing this upload 40 seconds in. too much lmaooo
Nilla wafer top hat time
Lake Bell was awesome in Wet Hot American Summer and Children's Hospital.
Its 2019 when will GMM get a 1440p camera?
Her Buldunu Agzina alma
Good mornin
These tongue exercises are mostly used by singers as their warm up
Wait, it’s not normal to be able to touch your uvula with your tongue??
My alarm clock says "wake up GMM just uploaded sleep is for the weak!"
Lake is female rhett .-.
I swear I’ve only ever recognised like 2 of the guests on this show.
👅😘
why was rhett's tongue purple?
What’s the trick in the thumbnail? He just put a pencil under his tongue...?
Is that a transgender ?
They need to bring back Children's Hospital.
I haven't even s l e p t
Good Mythical Morning everybody!
Do you think the whole singing that america song with your tongue out would work with any other national anthem or similar nationalistic song?
Anyone else try all the exercises with them? No just me 😅
The Mythical Crew should sometime randomize the number of fake answers and then put the questions in a random order. I know they think they do, but nah mate... You gotta do it with a computer. Here's few things: The first answer is ALWAYS true, always... The second has a small probability of being fake, if second wasn't fake, third has a big probability of being fake, if for some reason second or third wasn't fake, the fourth is. You can basically get a good score without even knowing the questions, because the "random order" has been done by humans and therefore is far from random.
Good MYTHICAL morning!
good mythical morning nerds >:)
Is she a he?
I can now use these to improve my sleep talking. Now my parents can make fun of me in the morning for saying nonsense even more cause now they can actually understand what I’m saying.
Good mythical freakshow
Am i the only one that thinks Rhett and Lake are the sane person
Since it is a big issue these days that people consume too much sodium.. you guys should test does salt really make foods that much better? if not, then we don't even need to add that salt! 
You could try either foods that usually have a lot of salt without salt, or then try random foods without salt then add salt(or try salted version) and see which is better... 
or.. you could try two same foods side by side and you need to guess which one has no salt added and which one does?
at least they knew the song America the beautiful... they have had guests on here that wouldn't have a clue... how many kids don't know that or the pledge of allegiance these days
My left tongue can touch my nose and the right one can touch my chin
I wanted to comment FIIIIIII111I1IIIIIII1IIIIIIIIIIII1IIIIIIIII111111IIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSTTTTTTT
Yeet
Did they bring in a woman just for the tongue challenge?
Seriously? They don’t even put a featuring in the title? Wow....
Who’s watching without socks on and be honest❤️
The intro music reminds me of a musical baby crying and has had way too much auto tune.
Can people actually not lick their own uvula?
How useful is this for when you have a girlfriend?
Anyone else think she looks like a distant relative of Lele Pons?
*3AM in Washington
Me: time to finish my 11 page es....good mythical morning?

Come on, we all know what tongue exercises are really for. ;)

Carful GMM creators on YouTube are getting copy stricken for singing a song lmao just  hope It doesn’t happen to u guys
12:23 thanks guys! It’s my birthday today 😃
Are they trying to kill us
Why am I watching this in public...
Yay I’m early
Should have had Jacob Anderson in this episode. 







If you know, you know. 


And if you know, I like you, kid.
Lol, don't tell me, next episode you're gonna have Mosh Peck?
Who else did these crazy tongue things with Rhett, Link and Lake?  It's fun to try them, but it does leave your lower lip feeling like it's been doused in a waterfall of saliva.
Your curious if you read more..






Have a life full of love and positivity!💚💜💛🧡 I'm on my way to 1k!

WILL YOU? BLESS THIS MESS
meh
Perfectly silly, that's my jam! And as I watched the professionals doing the exercises... there's a reason this stuff isn't common knowledge... no one would want to be seen doing that... I couldn't even take the professionals seriously. HOW DID THEY EVEN DISCOVER THESE "TECHNIQUES"?! it's probably a big joke, from ages ago, passed down as technique to be taken seriously when really it was used as humiliating punishment in the corner of class, like a dunce cap.
Good morning good afternoon or good night depending on what side of the world you're on!
I think we now know links celebrity crush
can this be the highest liked comment?
My younger can touch My uvughla ( idk how to spell it) to...that's a normal sentence
She's so cute 😊 I kept waiting for Link to say something inappropriate 😂😂
its 3am 




well, i can always go to sleep at 3:15am
k
Nobody:
Link: 9:03
Good morning mythical family!!
So I accidentally clicked my notification mid sleep and I thought I heard Drake Bell. Haha
Lake: I don’t do math, ok
Me: same girl
Lake was such a good guest, I love her deadpan but easygoing nature. So fun!
Which is just, 
 . . A stick
 . . .from outside😔
wow 16 view lol
Which came first, the Lake, or the Drake?
Statistics said that 2 out of 10 people can
Breathe for 20seconds with their tongue out,
Prove that you are that 2..







Now you look like a dog..
👇 I deserve a like if I fooled ya
Hello, I literally just watched endgame and its so sad.
I love when they have guests like her. She just feels natural and fits the dynamic. Very fun episode!
Early again, what a wonderful world this is 😀
Everyone here will say first.. I'm going to say... Bowling Balls!!
Thanks for the video my gf tries these exercises on me every night
wwwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooootttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
You guys don't have to upload everyday i feel like you guys would eventually not be in the mood
The beautiful America part sounded like a special Ed class in Washington DC
