I think Paco is underrated when it comes to these podcasts because he's always the one asking the interesting questions and keeping the coversation going.
We love u Paco <3
So this is basically an origin episode.
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY AUNTY!!!! <3
Now I want to see Kyle in this podcast
I can't believe I never knew Ryan's mom's name...I always just thought of her as "Ryan's Mom"
Ryan: Thank you for your support mom
Also Ryan: She's abusive
Omg her giggling/laughing throughout the video was the cutest thing
Happy mother's day to all the wonderful mothers out there.








Please vaccinate your kids
for such a recurring theme of this podcast you should really try and track down the girl from kindergarten and ask her what she remembers of the day ryan shoryuken'd her.
make it happen paco.
Still waiting for Skitzo Podcast..
When's it gonna be Kyle's turn on the podcast??
Dude, Paco’s such a good interviewer!! He can think on his feet so easily!
Podcast with everyone’s favorite YouTube mom? 


yes please
i love how much ryan's mom is laughing when ryan started roasting paco about being weak LOLOLOL
Paco is the MVP of this podcast episode. He smoothly directed all the questions :)
Paco: So You Relized He's Not A Normal Kid
Ryan: I'm Not A Kid Look At My Beard
🤣😂🤣😂
Need a video with kevjumba and chester see!!
After All this" JAMES vs TATI " drama.. This feels like a fresh Breeze 😌
Momma Higa looks beautiful and sounds so much like home 😁💕
That beard...
Uploaded 18 seconds ago - never been this quick before!
Paco is so good at this! He always keeps the conversations going in the podcast
Now we want a father's day podcast on 16th June (coincidentally it's also on Sunday)
So that history cud repeat itself from 2015
i love how well-spoken, funny and clever Ryan's mom is. she is so charming and seems so incredibly sweet and lovable :')
it was really interesting hearing all those stories from Ryan's childhood and as he was growing up. and i love how Paco and Lucy also have such a sweet relationship, like she's his second mom. the whole vibe of this episode was just totally endearing and heartwarming. loved every bit of it :)) <3
Ok now, we need your older brother to be on this podcast. Listening to all the embarrassing stories.
Yaass go Luci for protesting the mic breathing!!! I'm so glad someone finally refused to do it
Ryan lookin like a whole kung fu master with that beard
"5 billion people on this planet & you're the perfect mom for me, what are the odds of that?" - Young Sheldon.
I love how your mom's just giggling through out the entire video.
Jake Paul has like 200 ads for his 11 minute video and nigahiga has 2 for his 1 hour video. Respect man 🤛🏼
Not a single missed video, ads, and Aunty Luci?
This just keeps getting better every week. 
Hope you mamas out there have a nice Mothers Day.
Finally! The Woman who made nigahiga possible!
Your mom looks so young! And Mrs. Higa too!
honestly, paco doing great job with potcast, keep it up bro!
I think it would also be really interesting to have Paco's sister as a guest :)
Make this blue if u love your mom❤ 
👇  (im gifting my subscribers❤)
I just finished watching the last off the pill 💊 podcast and now i can watch this one
This was my favourite podcast so far! Just learning about Ryan’s childhood is so interesting
RHPC, your YT channel is the first channel I've ever watched here. I'm 17 now and I'm pretty sure Ive been subscribed for well over 8 years.  I found your channel through my sister and I'm pretty sure I stayed because watching another Asian like me made me feel less weird or alone.. I'm super happy you're still here
Bring Kevjumba on the podcast
DEAR RYAN; 
Can you make a dog race between all the dogs from RHPC
Ryan's mom: Well you know if this doesn't work out then you'll have to go back to school and all your friends have already graduated.


Ryan: Yeah.....


LOL
Can you do more dear ryan vids. Its been so long
WOAH...This is when you know our world is progressing 😂 best collab ever
'big family'
Lol my grandfather had 12 siblings, and my grandma had 8, and I don't even wanna start with my father's side. 

Aaaaah, the old days. Before the condom was a thing.
Prank vs prank had to separate cause of daily blogging, pretty sad they couldn't enjoy life just to satisfy others.
Jeez Ryan post something other than yours podcast please
"we fought over the computers" OH YEAH, I totally relate to that - early 2000s, me and my brothers fought over computers and tv channels all the time, between cartoon network and nickelodeon lol
The story about the lil depressed kid got me all teary eyed, I'm so happy he got to meet Ryan! So little can mean so much for people, incredible! <3
Next should be Kyle
Mama Higa you are a beautiful lady. Congrats on such a wonderful son!
Ryan remembers none of his childhood stories 😂
Next on Off The Pill Ryan's Brother and then his Dad
You wouldn't have to worry about your past getting revealed by your mom if you just didn't even have one

Modern problems require modern solutions
Ryan Higa looks like Manny Pacquiao with his beard like that...
I cant believe Luci agreed to this.
I can already tell this is going to be the cutest podcast ever
Happy to see his beautiful mom yay~ Thanks for having her!! Seeing you with a beard is interesting btw o.O
Put Kyle on the podcast next!
Shout out to my lds homies
Who else wants to see kevjumba in this podcast?
Paco's getting real good in the podcast thing and interviewing!
Dear Ryan can you do Avengerz: Brane Game or Avengerz: End Game. FAN SERVICE EXTREME!
An accountant with ADHD...gives me hope.
You are now immune to all James Charles comments.

Me to my Friend
"Hey i sound so different on recording, listen!"
says 'hello' to my voice recorder
playback: LAUREL!!!!
I wish Luci was my mom! She's very funny and deep.
Also such a simple, a humble and lovely Soul! 
Inward like outward, what a gorgeous being!! 
Was my fave podcast so far.
We need another cooking but not really
I have not been watching Ryan for so god damn long that I didn't know he actuallt grew Facial Hair
I’ve been looking at his past off the pill videos and notice that since the first episode he’s been looking increasingly asian 😂
Sometimes I believe Paco is the host.... Ryans a great host though. 
Paco, just creates engagement so quickly.
Dear Ryan, Do a parody of IT Chapter 2 : trailer
hey please please can you do fire style fire ball jutsus hand sign
Hearing the Ryan and Kyle dynamic is like an anime. Really reminds me of Naruto and Sasuke.
Dear Ryan:
 Do a parody of "Old time road".
@31:38 It sounds like Paco has great technique but poor strength. Just like some people who have great strength but no technique. Then there's whose of us who have none or both lol
Bro ive been watching you since the begining and i see you have stopped growing. I because all you jokes and videos are stuck in like 2012 you need new ideas
Your mom is hilarious....your so lucky🔥🔥🔥I am too!!!

AwesomePodcast keep up the great work...
No views but 31 like, seems legit
I'm loving these podcasts coz I get to hear more exciting stories about RHPC crew and of course, can witness ryan's prebeardy stage 😂
Paco-There was no entertainment that time..
Ryan-(in mind) god! This is awkward...
everytime ryan says “but you’re weak” and aunty luci giggles HAHAHAHAHAHA SO ADORABLE!!!
Tbh I really like Paco taking over the podcast and asking the questions.
dear ryan- can you make another BGA song! :)
Full confession, haven't been watching, now I am
Luci higa you're a beautiful mom. I love to see you again happy late mother's day.
if ear pulling is child abuse, i should call children's aid lmao
61st to like and 33rd to comment by the way you are my favorite YouTuber keep up the great work
Yes my G! Who remembers the mom rap?
i tried uploading fortnite videos before it was popular but then it became what it is right now
Dear Ryan do a if horror movies were not scary 2.0
This particular episode of OTP podcast is so real and relatable. It’s also good to hear the mind of a parent— gives us a perspective on how parents love and care for their kids. Happy Mother’s Day, Mommy Higa ❤️
Dear Ryan, can you make a parody of Endgame?
Very hype episode. Paco is so underrated! Thanks for the keeping the work
Ryan higa with a beard is the most terrifying creature in all of existence
Ryan: today is mothers day which is why we have Paco!
Paco: dies
Paco did a great job interviewing. And Ryan's mom was so cute. Thank you for sharing all the stories. ❤
Happy Mother's Day ! 
I LOVE You My Mom ! 
Hit Like if you do too !.
Still going strong with the beard Ryan. Good job lol
Wait Ryan's mom has a name?? and its not "Ryan's mom".....
Please bro get some Inspiration, and make some awe vids
Dear Ryan, can you make a video explaining about the James Charles + Tati situation.
We want Pewdiepie as guest. Who wants as well? Pls like it so that we can get attention!
For the last episode, I would love to see all of the guests or all of RHPC and all of them just talking over each other and just a whole crazy debate 😂😂😂

Thoughts?
First, please respond Ryan
BGA Comeback pls it's waaaay overdue
DEAR RYAN CAN YOU DO MORE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
0 view, i want top ⏫⏫⏫
Hey what's up ryan.
I've known you by the video 'Proving Illuminati' that video was inspired me.
And some Korean translated and made a subtitle for Koreans.
That was good idea for pun.
I tried to make him cry, she said. That is comedy gold.
Bring KevJumba’s dad onto this show
Was just watching RHPC vs the Sidemen!!
His mom is so pretty
The one person that I really want to see in this podcast is dtrix
Woohoo! New podcast! :D
I have noticed that since Ryan has been making these “Off the Pill” podcasts it’s been getting fewer views compared to the older vids
Your mum is gorgeos! Thank for this podcast. I loved it how you were realistic about choosing your path and everything. And also I like how Luci Higa said that you should always mention the downsides of the child's ideas. I think it's really important not to grumble, yell and shoud - just listen and explain the possible minuses. Not to control, but act as a guidance
I work really hard for the vids I make, it takes like 3-6h To make one video, and I get paid off by getting made a meme In my friend group 😑
WAIT NO VEIWS I'M THE FIRST!
Wait 50 minutes isn't normal 

My life is a lie!!!!
Ryan higa i rewatched your BgA video so can you make another one? If so thank you
I thought I would be first to comment, but I was over 100 comments late. Good enough
Bring Kyle for the next podcast
Pretty sure Ryan’s first word was LAMP
I’d love to see you do a updated draw my life one day Ryan. 




Keep it up making Hawai’i proud with your success on YouTube. Wish I could the same but don’t know how.
Aw, happy Mother’s Day! I love ur mom Ryan ❤️
I want to see Jacksfilm in this podcast, just curious to see the OG's youtuber talk each other
Your pill isn't propped on correct color correspondence to your "Off the Pill" logo just fyi LOL It bothered me
Not talking with your brother untill they leave for college is so relatable. We weren't allowed to b in the same room without supervision.
dear ryan pls make a movie about mobile legends
ryan your losing your views 
GO BACK TO DEAR RYAN
Happy mother’s day to auntie! Such a lovable person!
Off topic but congrats Kyle on his upcoming marriage!
I love that ryans mom is just giggling in the background the entire time
But aren’t our skulls tuning the sound coming from the video?
Illuminati confirmed?
This was probably my most favorite episode. Luci is just so natural and flowing so well with the conversation and her talking about being a parent is so heartwarming
Me and my THREE brothers are not allowed in the same room without adult supervision 👍
I love how he said he did a collab with KSI but it’s not even out yet
Who else Didn't Even knew Ryan has a dad ... He is not in any videos
PLEASE don't stop breathing into the mic
That comment was in respect for you to make a video :)
Greatest Asian YouTuber of all time no cap
We need Ryan's brother next!
I want more of those old Dear Ryan Videos
PLEASE DO A I DARE YOU WITH YOUR MOM. I NEED THIS.
Happy mothers day Paco...I mean Ryan's mom.
i relate So hard to Ryan and Kyles relationship its actually odd. Now i know it ain't just me.
Why did you mess up your channel like that :/
“Other than Mormon families...”🤣🤣🤣
I love how spontaneous this podcast is 
I love auntie lucy .. some moms you can't even sit with them and have a conversation as open as this .. this was really good i appreciate everyone who was a part of it💕
My Anxiety went thru the roof on this video. i enjoyed it but it was torture. Everytime mama HIga would talk it felt like she wanted to cry and everytime i thought she was. Great video btw would watch again
Ryan mentioned Kev Jumba! Can you get him at least on Off the Pills?
My mom's name is Lucy your mom's name is Luci
🙈🙈😁
Nobody:
Ryan: And I don’t remember this but proceeds to go into vivid detail of the story he doesn’t remember 😂😂
LMAO Ryan’s mom is just like mine 😂
She’s completely filled out my brothers baby album but I only have 2 pictures of me in mine 😂
How bout for the ending each person says teehee. Boom you have an ending and there's no breathing into the mic
ryan u better shave
just sayin
nuf said
SUGGESTION!
You start off the Podcast with clapping individually, how about you do a three way "clap" at the end? (three way high-five)
Packs idea of hitting your head on the mic to end the podcast is interesting to me...
Me: this is Soooo long

Watches rest of the off the pill podcasts runtime 

Also me : this off the pill podcast is short
Jupiter! Mom's spaghetti! :D Happy Mother's Day Auntie and to all the moms out there, especially to my Mama. :)
They should have a 4 person podcast with Arden , Ryan , Paco , and Ryan’s mom 
To see if ryan’s mom approves 😂😂😂😂
dear ryan can you spend a day without opeaning your eyes
Dear ryan can you do a seven ring parody.....sorry I had to ask😂
I love your podcasts😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hands down, the best OTP episode. Your mom is delightful and endearing. And this is probably the funniest episode too. Definitely have her on again, maybe also with Arden? Would be interesting to see the dynamic. And maybe roast Ryan 😂
"Opportunity"or "opera-tune-knitting?" I can only hear the latter thanks to the mom's spaghetti rap xD
Listening to Ryan’s mom, every mom from Hawaii always sounds similar to the way they talk! 😂
Paco, putting food in a sleeping person's mouth is super dangerous. I'm really not a worrywart either.
Damn paco, good job holding your own man. ❤❤🔥🔥
when the vacuum turned into the guns was definitely hilarious
James Charles licked you.

Dear ryan, can you twerk? 
Dear ryan, can you ride a skateboard?
Dear ryan, can you ride a skateboard while twerking?
Ryan is always mean to paco LIKE FOR PACO🤧😞👊🏼✊🏼
Ryan's mom really give great information about parenting. If I have a kid one day, i will apply the same thing for them. Guide them to focus, and make them choose one individual sport and one team sport.
Thanks Mrs Higa.
Could you add/ feature your other channel
Dear Ryan, Can You Make A Song About Narcissistic People?
loved this podcast, Ryan's mom is great
bring kyle on next
Keep the beard bro! 🔥
Hey Ryan, you're probably not gonna see this, but I really enjoy this series.  To me it really goes back to your roots.  It's not just a podcast, but talking story.  I enjoyed this so much and I could listen to these kind of things all day.  If talking story helps you keep your sanity it would be cool if you had fans come on to see you too!  We'd love to just have a chance to converse with you!  You're doing great!  All the love from Hawaii!
Ryan, i grew up in
 North Kohala, are u related 
to Mr Higa who owned
Union Market? 💚 thatstore
Mother’s Day is on Son Day




(?_?)
I always thought that Ryan only joked about adhd
Your mom is adorable
A highly technical and futuristic research has shown that a beard can make YouTubers upload constantly.
Paco's mic keeps shaking, keep careful it's screwed tight! :)
Guys never forget the rap his mom made👍....that’s THE Anthem 

(My like makes a 899.....MAKE A 900 !)

Anyone checkin up comments b4 the vid?😂

Seeing this side of him after all these years makes me happy . He grew up in my home town.
Why is british and US mothers day at different times. UK was in march

You should make another channel for the podcasts, and/or like a patreon or something :/
Somehow enjoy this a lot more than his regular videos
You know I watch your older podcast videos to help me sleep because of anxiety. It's nice to listen to the talk.
Whens the next BgA vid
Luci looked hella cool in the rap video cover.
He’s still soooo hot omg
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY MRS. LUCI!
So what I'm hearing is Kyle is the Itachi to Ryan's Sasuke
I love the way this channel is not at all about all the YouTube drama.
This was so wholesome. Thank you. 💕💕
Like 👍for Ryan's smile😄
Seriously Paco is so amazing in leading the conversation! Talent right there. Asking the right questions etv
Best YouTube Mom ever! Happy Mother’s Day, Aunty Higa
Holy shot he grew a beard in five

16 straight weeks of uploads
40:27
"The hypes gone"
LMAO
I’d like to see Ryan’s brother in a podcast.
That trophy behind Ryan’s mum next to the I dare you trophy is from the Ryan Higa  vs the Sidemen
Dear Ryan 
How do you not not be awkward (double negative) as a 10 year old in front of your brother (who studies in a college) this is a serious question btw
I don't even have enough attention span to watch all of this...
It’s been three years... we need how to sing like your favorite artists 3
Please do more of these podcasts if possible!
I really love them and they help me get through dishes and other chores!
'A kid..? TCH look at my beard!' Finally calling out that beard lol
Now we need Kyle to be on the podcast!!!
Come on Ryan! Where’s 
Parkourse

Dear Ryan,  do how commercials are without editing
Ryan's origin story
Omg, didn't expected this at all
Y'all remember when she rapped to lose yourself
Paco is a great mod! He keeps everyone on track without jumping around too much. I really love these
OMG WHATS WID THESE PODCASTS UNSUBSCRIBED
First Daina, now your mom! Are all the RHPC women this awesome!
Kyle would be awesome to have. I’m an older sibling of someone with adhd and hearing his perspective would be dope. Man up and get on camera Kyle 😂
Can u make a video on kissing prank
Dear Ryan,
Since you love the band queen, could you make a mashup of a few queen songs?
Does no one miss his normal videos? I like podcasts but......
Your mom has a nice voice and I think she’s a really nice woman
Remember that first video you did on Minecraft in 2015? Do a pt. 2
End it with everyone saying "TEEHEE" ?
Hi Ryan!! 
since a subscribers since I was sixth grade and I am only 2 years younger than you.... now I am a lisenced teacher!! I show your videos to my students...
I love your videos but sadly I cant listen to podcasts as I have a disorder called misophonia. Someone kill my disorders so I can listen to ryans conent :(
We need a part 2 with Kyle and Luci together
Yeah farther day is on Sunday..
Off The Pill Podcast #16 Paco learn to parent.
thx for the nice wholesome episode
Thank you, Paco for this idea 💡
This episode was complete Paco questioning and i must say its a real good job
Superpowers women always support you,  love our mom. Give 👍👍👍👍👍👍 for mom
That was the first time i listened the whole hour, and i really enjoyed it. Thank you for the great and funny video / podcast
This is a great video... thanks Ryan, and Mrs. Higa for sharing this!  As a 2nd kid in my own family, I can relate to so much of what happened to Ryan...
Dear Ryan: can you make a fake trailer about "YouTube"?
Ryans judo trophy (sliver) is behind or beside his mother
Dear Ryan, sing NCT Simon Says Taeil'S HIGH PITCHED note

Luci is definitely such a wholesome parent. Ryan's success is also partly due to such wholesome parenting. Happy mother's day to her!
MAMA HIGA 💚💚💚
I love Ryan's mom, I remember long time ago she used to share pictures of Ryan's art work from high school I believe ? She seems the type of mom that's a Mom to everyone 😊 so much love
dear ryan, please make more dear ryan videos because they're the best videos on youtube :)
Mad 1 ad in a 1 hour video
I rmb when i first saw Kyle in one of Ryan's video (which i can't exactly recall which one) i went binge watching ALL of his videos to find every chance i can spot Kyle even in their BTSs. Please...be on the podcast once before you get married Kyle! Or after. Either way I don't mind just once (if not more) 😣🙏🙇
I am one out of 7 and I have a friend who is one out of 13
I know I'm late, but what happened to his "I Dare You" videos?
Ryan where'd you get that shirt? I want it
She’s so cute I love her.🤗🥰
When auntie Luci said opportunity , I remembered Making My Mom Rap Like Eminem! XD Or this was a setup for another episode hmmm
Mrs. Ryan’s mom, you sound and look great! You have brought us this wonderful man so I thank you!
I love how open minded Ryans Mom is.
I remember Kyle lipsyncing videos with Ryan. OG days haha
Happy Mothers day to all the mothers💖
Me : Your mum is hot, Ryan.
Also me : this is awkward....
“Anti Luci”

Am I the only one?
I'm so glad you did a podcast with your mom! Otherwise I'd just know the Luci in the rapping video and other videos where you can see her just for a second or so. And that was not the best representation of her! I love her now!!!
Ryan relationship with his brother is almost exactly like mine. I'm in the phase where I'm in college and our relationship is getting better but damn is it hard to work at. Idk if anyone else has this kind of deal but Ryan's the first one I've heard that's like mine. A lot of people have close siblings but like Ryan's it just doesn't happen to us I guess.


Thanks for sharing Ryan.
This is the most interesting Off the Pill Podcast so far :D
I came early because I saw Ryan and his mom and I know this is going to be the best episode💖
In Ireland Mother’s Day is usually on around the 30th of March .!!
Ryan’s mum: You know.

Naruto: You know.
that kid reminded me of Conan Gray...but that can't be
Just started a podcast. I would appreciate the support! Just trying to give out information. THE WORLD IS YOURS PODCAST!!! 🙏
Ryan. Shave...


Shave your eyebrows, but keep the beard
SKITZO PODCAST 

Happy Mother’s Day
Hey Ryan! Have you stopped making videos??? 😭😭

124 views only hype

But I like your old vines type of videos
i made a mistake typing THOR
Seriously.... 130k views atm ? whyyy
She sounds like the mom from Bob's Burgers
Happy Mother's day everyone!!
The beards coming along higa
What a great origin type episode. I really want to see a full-blown pidgin episode. Maybe get Kyle on. it  Would have choke laughs.
Dude Ryan looks like how I look with that Snapchat filter on
Imagine Luci Higa doing some of Ryan Higa's vids
I'm from Curacao! Wow I never thought Ryan would mention it ever that's so cool
I relate to his mom with not liking the pictures thing. Also my family’s started to photograph every occasions saying “You can never get these moments back” and getting mad when I don’t smile big enough

BUT LET ME EAT FIRST. MY FACIAL MUSCLES NEED ENERGY!!!!
Dear Ryan, can you make another BgA song for us???
More podcasts episodes guests:
1. Greg
2. Paco
3. Kyle
4. Dtrix
5. Chester
6. Kina Grannis
7. Wong fu cast
Wow, so I guess Paco is with Ryan's mom since Ryan said thank you mom to Paco



Its a joke, most people might take this seriously
Love that off the pill pill in the background
This video is just too lovely.
I really was expecting ryan to post on Mother's day
Ryan's kid will punch another kid
You guys talk too much about other stuff, but I still give you a like.😊

This episode of podcast is just so good. So interesting and so much information you can get.

Nigahiga: I don't care.
This video is a true reason why Ryan is my favourite YouTuber. His opinions and views on situations are so realistic and relatable.

Sticking with the facial hair.

Aunty, thank you so much for being on this podcast even if you like to stay away from videos!!  It's always interesting to see more backstory on people you like and respect and what kind of great parents they have :)
could you get josh fu on the podcast? for people who dont know he was a past rhpc member who joined and left after a short while
Yay a mother's day video.  I assume.  I haven't watched it yet.
Just wondering, is it better for me to listen to this on youtube or on spotify? What do content creators like ryan prefer?
Luci Higa is very pretty
Origins: Ryan Higa! This is gonna make more money than the X-men Origins one. lol
Do more Ryan tries
I Think it would be Nice to see chester see on the podcast
Ryan, do a off the pill podcast with PewDiePie click like if you want too.

im curious during which videos where he was filming during his college days
nice conversation, amazing details and good Paco's moderation!
Slap sean and do moonwalk
USE ROGAIN ON YOUR FACE! Please, I really can’t watch these.
We wanna see Kyle reveal some stories of yours!! 😍😍
Who else thinks Ryan’s mom should have her own channel
He looks so old with beard  and amazing ❤️❤️❤️
luci higa sounds like a great rapper's name
ryan remember the conspiracy theory your making...then make a a conspiracy based on pewdiepie and t series
I love off the pill, but... I also love your skits and commercials. Could you do one of those please! Thanks. 👌
Dear Ryan can you do a house tour
These are great! But Do more Ryan Tries: Videos !
"if it's interesting i will remember it... sometimes." same :D
My friend drew an amazing pic for her mum. She wrote: Happy Fathers’ Day Mother!
So who's this half Dutch and half Japanese guy?? What's his @?
Paco feels like the most mature and asked really important question, i don't know how i feel about mature and calm non comedy Paco XD
Your brother was in the video game video.
Can you make a fake trailer
10 mins in and I already love Ryan's family, why can't my mom accept that I have adhd, she doesn't even try to listen
Your mom and markipliers mom, I feel, would have a great time on a lady's day out.

It the prequel to How To Be Ninja

I really enjoy watching you and your mom interaction....happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there.
Love this episode ❤️
I remember my mom told me we basically had a photoshoot of 7 different outfits cause she realised how little amount of pics she had of me, 2nd child. So many of my baby pics are just from the same day 😂😂
Okay, now I want the bullied boy from story to come on the pod!
Dear Ryan, can you do another parkourse those are my favorite
The saga of Ryan Higa:Origin

Paco appreciation
Still waiting for yourybe reryan 2018
Hey what if you end the podcast by asking us a question and the then the next time you post the podcast you look at the best answers
I know this is a bad question, but are you ever going to shave that facial hair? It looks a bit like you have a gap between your mustache. Sorry, but i don't think it fits well. Now that's just me.
If you like it then fine, I can get behind it bro. I will still watch your videos :)
29:25
I'm coming, Paco
I am coming for you all
I will storm your house
and become not depressed
it will be so cool omg can't wait
Is that trophy that RHPC won against sideman?
Happy Mother's Day ♡♡ 
Its not everyday you get to hear 
Stories from Ryan's Mother 
She gave birth to a legend 
And i can't stress enough the role and influence that Nigahiga has to my Creativity in Age where people just try to emulate and imitate 
He stands out of all 
And there is a reason to all that 
His parents
parents will shape you to be who you are 
Thank you for everything
Awww! Happy Mother’s Day y’all! 

Like this if you love your mother 😊😄
Love the fact that Paco calls Ryan's mom aunty. Just an Asian thing that I noticed.
Bring ur brother onto the podcast
Mama Higa❤
I'm a second child too, so from 39:32 to 41:00 it's like the story of my life😂😍
Who else thinks he is one of the best youtubers ever
0:19 meme......................review.

Roses are red 
My profile is blue

A mother's day special podcast! Happy Mother's Day to RHPC's moms, and to all of you reading this🌹
I wonder when podcast will get played out
Can you eat the hottes pepper in the world
This is a great podcast. BUT the pill is upside down...the logo has red on top.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix the pill, my ocd, please haha
what a refreshing break from seeing James Charles crap all over youtube
to end it you should pretend to take pills. because it's like now that you're off the podcast you get back on the pill
Deer can you do a theory about Bermuda Triangle
Hey guys, lets make Ryan see this... In my school we had to write a letter to anyone famous and I chose Ryan Higa.  My teacher sent all of them yesterday. Hopefully he sees it.
WHERE IS THE PERSON WITH TIMESTAMPS
Oof, I really feel what they're saying about Kyle.  The whole competitive sibling good at everything is tough, and I can relate to that, especially since my brother is actually also named Kyle.
So Kyle dislocated Ryan's elbow, and then Ryan's dislocated his elbow while wrestling in his high school senior year...
I do edit videos, so I understand that editting videos is a long and te tedious process  much less for me since all of my editting skill is very basic. If you watch the videos on my channel, you'll know how basic my editting skills are.
Just saw an off the pill mug on the table.  Is this also in other episodes?
i rlly miss I DARE U
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY
I love this podcast.
Luci your voice isn't bad at all
Is the intro like pewdiepie's intro to meme review?
I remember around like 2006-2008 my calabash cousin (Rellez) told me that Ryan and he use to hang out in like high school wherever they went on big island. I grew up on Oahu, and I remember watching Ryan and thinking it was really cool that he was from Hawaii.
Please keep this beard forever

Hi, Ryan and RHPC. It seems that all of your uploads turned into podcasts now, so does it mean that you'll be transitioning into a podcast channel instead? How about the other projects you're working on? I'm just really curious on how exactly you want your plans to turn out. No hate; just a concerned fan. Have a great day!

I want Kyle in this podcast
Dear Ryan can you do an experiment where you sleep in your room with mirrors all around the room
love the content
Paco stand as the representation of the people of the world who are always looked over because of their "normal-ness".  Moreover, Paco's representation is what us as individuals are fighting against everyday.  Through his emotions and actions, we can tell that Paco has negative feelings that reside deep in his conscious. Everyone just laughs but never really knows what going on. Does he think that the jokes about him are funny too? We as a society have to reflect on the person we were and the person we are now. Paco is not just a youtuber but an icon of our generation and the standing human example of the word struggle. This is a water shedding moment in history where as a body in society we have to ask ourselves what we are doing with the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Everyday is a never ending fight but it is at this moment that we stand together: for it is only together that we prevail. People will tell you that Paco is a bad word but is our job to change their perception.  Paco is not a person, IT is a PEOPLE. Paco unites us in one from the introverts and the extroverts. Through Paco and Paco only, we have finally discovered that it is only TOGETHER WE PREVAIL. This is a dark time for everyone, politically, socially, and mentally. Finals week is coming up soon and I want to let everyone know that Paco is with you always. Thank you.
Let’s have a vote 
Like for city

Podcast sucks
HEY, you reading this, 
I hope you had a super AWESOME day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be HAPPY about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always HOPE. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be HAPPY, LAUGH, SMILE! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone LOVES and CARES about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
  I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. It’s the same thing with my channel, my goal is to be able to use it as a platform to spread positivity and make an impact, not for fame and fortune. Also maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cuz i just wanna make everyone happy:)
6.9k likes and 69 unlikes..... hmmm.....
why do all of you hate paco

niggahitter
This is UNDERRATED comment
Am I the only one that misses Ryan's OG Vids that aren't podcasts?
"Well you guys could pay for college too!" That's right, Luci! Tell em!
BATMAN DIES IN ENDGAME




You're welcome
Hey Ryan, can you make a video about zodiac signs. especially for gemini😂
Can u plz make more normal vids?

I Think Rayan doesn't like making Videos anymore.
Ryan should never grow a beard
Wait...




Ryan's mom a dude?????
Ryan reminds me of Shikamaru 😂 cause he just doesn’t try😂
PACO did a good job in this episode. He is getting better at moderating the conversation.
Off the pill=no more content

Title: Ryan's Mom Reveals His Past
Video: Ryan's Mom Reveals her own Past
The first ever podcast that I watched 1/4 of it.
I would love to see Dr. Mike on the podcast
You only do podcasts now can you at least do one skit I miss the old Ryan Higa
Am i the only one who doesnt really enjoy these off the pill podcasts? maybe its because they arent as well made as ryans usual videos or because theyre just too long... idk anyone with me?
5 episodes of off the pill in a row man its getting a bit repetitive
Who else is waiting for Ryan to release an actual video that's not off the pill :(
enough with the podcasts already...
YOUR AWESOME!!!! 
TRUE FANS LIKE THIS COMMENT LETS GO TOP!
To be honest I don’t like these that much... I miss Sean... :(
nigahiga is a racist name
Ryans mom: is stereotypical asian parent
also Ryans mom: isnt
I’m getting tired of constant podcasts
Is your mom revealing YOUR past, or is your mom male? 🤔 You never know nowadays...
Idk why im still subscribed..this is boring u were better
Eww shave that thing off
Im unsubscribing cuz these podcast videos are so boring
No one likes pill podcast no one likes them
Nigahiga is shit. Ahaha)))
Honestly pls stop this Ryan 
Bring the old stuff back or yur old self
This was fun until the podcast




I probably gonna get alot of backlash
Of this but its my opinion
Daina is so pure 🥺 she really adds something special to the team
15:20 "She still got butterflies thinking about him...... Thats DISGUSTING "
I just love Paco!!
Daina is best girl
Daina is a solid 10

Make Daina's stalking story into an anime skit please
Daina IS a solid 10 though. she's beautiful, she's smart, she's insanely talented and creative, AND she seems like the sweetest, loveliest person ever. so yeah, she is ABSOLUTELY a 10.
I bet David Choi's probly feeling salty about all of the nice comments Daina's been getting😂😂
Consistent uploads. Ryan is a changed man
Dana and Greg’s relationship is what Paco wants
anyone else remember when ryan was most subscribed on youtube?

...yeah
those were the golden days.
An anime could literally be made based exactly on Greg and Daina’s relationship
DAINA’S A SOLID TEN 





Actually she’s like an 11
Dude, I love Daina. She is so humble and chilled.
52:02 - The moment i realized, Daina has one of the most perfect voices for a Voice Actress position for like a cartoon or an anime!
edit: DANA IS A SOLID 10!
Daina, what a pure beautiful soul and also a solid 20/10! <3 Love you so much Daina, my fave RHPC person.
DAINA IS A SOLID 10 this whole podcast showcased her sweetness and encouraging personality and RHPC wouldn't look good without her
MAKE A NINJA MELK HONEST COMMERCIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT!!!
I saw daina and clicked immediately
Love u daina
Ryan should make a “nice guys remastered”
Ryan Is A Solid Ten
Daina Is A Solid Ten


(Paco Is A Four At Most)
Why hasn’t Greg proposed yet 😤
Diana is so pure, she is kind, beautiful, smart and creative. I love watching the old videos where they would do surprise performances and birthdays, Diana was always like the core, she would do all the creative stuff and organise the decorating and stuff. She is my fav.
Daina is the sweetest lil jellybean and the rest of RHPC is like the fart, booger, barf flavored jellybeans. But like, somehow it all works.
Woah Ryan growning his semi-beard out! Also, why the energy drink shameless plug?!
Daina is a 15 for being such a good sport! <3
Can you do an anime skit of the way Daina and Greg met
Plz
Damn, I wish I wasn't living on the other side of the world so I could buy some Ninja Melk


I love energy drinking while gaming or watching Ryan's podcasts...
Thanks for having me on the podcast!! 💊🙈
Who else wishes that dear Ryan’s are brought back
Ignore the hate on your podcasts Ryan. Keep making these👍👍
36:00 yakult
it's not an energy drink but now I can't stop thinking about it
help
this was such a nice, light-hearted episode (not that I  don't like the more serious ones!)
I really enjoyed it!

PS: Daina IS a solid 10
It's interesting to see Daina like this.  During the vlogs she is always the most quiet and more on the background so to see her in the spotlight a bit it's nice.
Damn I am surprised about her stalking and creepy side XD
Paco's girlfriend analogy actually makes sense tho
FINALLY got to finish the entire thing oh my god daina is a solid 10 yeeeet ly guys love the podcast
I love Dana’s energy I wish I could be as positive in life as her
dear ryan,
it’s been 10 years, can you recreate ninja melk?

it could be a whole new script, i just want an updated version haha
Soo when's the Skitzo podcast coming?
3 at best... 

Why are we still here, just to suffer
If Ryan and Daina pair up to make greeting cards, I'd buy them for every holiday.
ryan really should make an anime skit for daina's character ❤️❤️
Daina and Greg were made for eac other *_*. If that's not relationship goal, idk what is XD
Dang Greg you're a lucky man. "Daina is a solid 10" both beauty and personality! Hands down.
Daina is so adorable I loved this episode.


 
And yes Daina is a solid ten
I fart on my girlfriend quite often xD it's so fucking funny and we both crack up every time xD 
Stinks though, and she never farts, she's one of the suppressed farters of our generation
OMG I love daina!!!!! She's so pure and cute and I just want to hug her! She's a solid 10!
everytime i wud tell myself to watch all of these podcast halfway, but i still ended up watching the whole. i guess i just cant fake  my love towards these bunches
Just a suggestion: for sponsors which requires sign-ups, etc. I think it would also be best to remind us/ repeat the spill at the end of the podcast so that we could go at it right after. Like, I wanted to sign-up when you promoted it but then I'm still watching this, so I can't do it just yet. Then by the time it ends, I've already forgotten about it. (I only remembered it this time because I made sure to take note of it) :)
Lol daina I also did odd/creepy things like u when it came to my crush 🤣😅
DAINA IS A 100000/10! THE WHOLE LAMP FAMILY LOVES HER <3
Daina is a gem. Love her. Keep her safe and protected!! 💜🖤
But Daina is a 10. A better Daina than me lol
DUDE I HAVE BEEN WATCHING  NIGAHIGA FOREVER BUT NEVER KNEW GREG AND DAINA ARE TOGETHER  
I feel like such a shitty fan know
I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TO DAINA. THIS IS AWESOME!!!
ITS DIANA ROSS! hehe I know it’s pronounced ‘daina’
I'm gonna be honest. I never realized how pretty Daina was until now. She seems super cool too.
Daine is a solid 10! But honestly she's sooo pretty omg
What’s the history behind the name “nigahiga” of ur channel
dear ryan pls make a movie about mobile legends
Damn, 15 years? That longer than a lot of married couples last 😂. I love Diana's laugh especially at 19:00
Guys, (and girl) please do RHPC games again on the second channel.
Spyfall, I dare you, mafia etc. Please.
THAT IS NOT WEIRD AT ALL. THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE I HAVE EVER WATCHED SO FAR 💗
That helped me sleep thank you
Dear Ryan, can you make a video explaining about the James Charles + Tati situation.
All this time and I never knew Daina's family name was Benzon
I was a pure genius when it came to eating chips in class. never caught.
bet greg had a good time editing it 
nd if daina is 3 then paco is also 3 but on the other side of natural numbers
Off The Pill: Exposing Greg (ft. Daina)
Didn't know too much about what Daina, awesome to see how to apply your creative skills in so many ways!

Daina is a solid 10 :)
I love how perfect the RHPC crew is. They basically came together through fate and make such beautiful videos for us :")
I love Dana. She is my favourite member of rhpc
Dude I love daina. She’s honestly the best
Paco: "She still got butterflies, that's disgusting". I love this man so much

Dear Ryan, why is your favorite book the Cactus Book?
Daina is a solid 💯
Daina is a solid 10
I kept thinking about a game called Yandere Simulator when she told her story of how she met him. The locks of hair and the footprint on a plate she kept. She followed people she had a crush on too.
dear rian bring back skitzo
Daina is a solid 10 
And at heart she is over 9000
Great podcast 
Keep it up

Daina is such a little ball of sunshine and must be protected at all costs!! Love all of you guys actually 🤗
Like the facial hair Ryan!!!
You should do a video the evolution of tee-hee's from the end of your videos
Omg please get Greg to say his side of the story!! lol
 I love Greg and Daina <3
Daina is 100% a solid 10
Absolutely loved this podcast, got to learn so much about Greg and Daina. Much love and respect. (Daina is a solid 10! ❤)
Also admire the dynamic and mutual respect between Ryan and Daina. The way Ryan kept apologising everytime he accidentally interrupted Daina. It's the little things that make me adore RHPC so much. I'm a proud lamp! ❤
Daina is (fr) a solid 10
This video 100% confirmed by bisexuality, she’s so sweet, Greg’s so lucky

I subscribed to your channel. 😀
Podcast with all the skitzo characters, PLEEEASE!!!
Ninja Melk? Like that video you made with Sean back in 2009? It's been 10 years and you still can't let go, Ryan. :P
Me: sitting quietly, eating and listening to Off the Pill
Paco: I once threw up and diarrhead myself
Daina is a solid ten 🤩 this was such a funny insightful episode
Daina is a solid 10 while Paco is -30 at best.
Diana is so cool for that, but sometimes I also wondered how the do some of the videos bc they look so extreme and that would require a lot of patience so props to you for the videos this was fun to watch
Definitely a 10 out of 10 :> She's gorgeous!
Daina is hands down the most humble girl
Daina is a 12/10 💓 but can I just say Paco keeps such a good conversation flow and his laugh is everything
broooooo i once kept the hall pass my crush brought to the class
Daina is a 10!
She's sooo honest and sweet. My God. She's a 💯
Daina is a 10




Out of 100

That's a new side of Daina. :0 I kinda still see those type of girls as cute in their own way. XD But interesting to see an actual one for the first time.


Daina, solid 10/10. :3
Daina is a solid 10!! Love these podcasts, keep up the good work!!

Smoothest shi shi break transition so far
Yes Daina!!!! ♥ She's always the most quiet during videos so it's really really nice to see her talk about things in her life. :) Hope she gets another podcast episode in the future! :D Love you Daina, you're a solid ten!
Daina is a solid 10  :D


So glad you guys did this-- I've always wanted to hear from Daina at length because she's only in very short snippets of the BTS. It was super interesting to hear about her process. You cool, Daina, you cool x)
Daina is a solid 10!!! Loved this!!
I haven’t been here in a long time bro I was here before 7000 subs
Daina is a 10

A solid 10
Here i am smiling till my mouth hurts.....diana is just so cute
The anime character you're going for is a Yandere. Someone who stalks and is willing to do anything to be with that person. Including murder....so yeah lol
Daina is a 10, a solid 10.
27:03 in, My finance and I met in kindergarten in '89. We were also neighbors and played together all the time. (She had an NES and I still only had an Atari) We have been together since. I really like your and Greg's story Daina! I don't believe in much, but I do believe in love at 1st sight. ALSO RHCP, MUCH LOVE! BEEN WITH YOU GUYS SINCE, Like, '06 OR '07? Please never stop!!!
I'm seriously loving these podcasts. It's awesome to finally be giving Daina some credit she deserves!


also Daina is a TEN! I want another episode with her
Does Arden fart?
Ryan (casually): yeah
Then proceeds to talk about the sounds she makes while pooping.
Arden must be pissed/embarrassed
Wow ive been here since podcast one and 200k subs
Omg i was waiting desperately for this episode of off the pill podcast
Anyone remember Ryan's old Ninja Melk video?
I love how Ryan is trying his best to not be too judgemental towards Daina.
You should have Daina on permanently as like a female point of view type thing.  Kind of like Howard Stern and Robin.  I don't think she's creepy at all.  I think she's cute.
Plz do more anime in real life!
14:18 SO CUTE, this is actually the funniest podcast, love Pyscho Daina! Literally mee
They be rocking them hyperx cloud alphas.
I've always loved Daina so so much....this is my fav offthepill BECAUSE OF MY BOO DAINA 💕💕💕 Love you Daina keep being YOU, YOU is awesome hehe
Diana your a 10000/10 love you ❤️ I would love to work in RHPC
Daina is so awesome! I have so much new found respect for her after getting to know that she actually creates the props and costumes (especially those lightsticks which I thought were company made and always wondered why Ryan wouldn't add them to his bga merch lol )!! I knew RHPC was immensely creative and hands on but wow is Daina the most awesome person ever!

Also Daina is definitely a solid 10
I ordered 2 packs of Ninja Melk the moment Ryan told us about it!



Ps:I hope Ninja Melk gets big
Daina is really precious 😭
Daina!
I really hope you read this.

You are a wonderful, beautiful, interesting and such a complete person. Thanks for your work and effort. The things you do for the team make this channel a wonderful one.

RHPC and Greg are so lucky to have you around.

Kind regards, from a fan from Chile!
Have a wonderful day!
Daina is a solid 10/10... but her art tho...
I WHEEZED SO HARD I THOUGH SHE WAS ALSO GONNA SAY "I don't know if I still have it, but that boy is in my closet" LMAO ksdghioefg

LMFAO!!! Daina is soo funny and super cute! It's about time she got onto Off The Pill!! I always wanted to know more about her. She's great.
So glad to hear from Daina! (Thanks Haleybird7 for helping with my weird phone 😂) She’s always around but you don’t get to hear much from her this was awesome!

Diana is a solid ten for sure!! She is so talented !! Luv her on the team ;)

I don't even drink energy drinks but....

Sean has got to come back so that they can put up the video of them putting the OTP room together😂😂😂 gotta expose the process
Bruh I always talk about poop with my friends ...
it’d be fun if victor king or kev got on here. FOR THE GOOD OL TIMES
You can open a bag of chips without making noise- just use scissors
I call my technique Pocket Chips. What you do is
1. Open the bag of chips before class starts.
2. Put it into your pockets.
3. Make a nicely sized opening to make the least amount of sound as possible.
4. Enjoy.
As to eat it just put it in your mouth and just wait until it dissolves.
Daina is a SOLID ten
Daina is an 11/10 because she’s outstanding.
Diana talks exactly like Valkyrae!!
Looks like Sean with the goatee

Also, I don't encourage burping or farting freely by anyone, male or female.
Do you know that you can poke a hole into the cover of any bottle and drink in the small hole that can't be seen the teacher will say that your not aloud to drink but you show the teacher your not drinking anything bit you actually are. . :)
I enjoyed this episode so much DAINA UR SO CUTE 🥺
Ryan I’ve been waiting 12 years when is the Stalking Mangina coming out?
It’s been “Coming soon” for a long long time.
Disclaimer: you may not want to eat while watching this episode

Yuno stalking Yuki from The Future Diary.
already listened on spotify, i just came to see the giant pill case thing
An hr is too short :(
Luv how this podcast was hella chill🔥
love the podcast, thank you!
How close is RHPC personally. Like, what’s the difference between your work relationship, and your personal relationship with each other. 

4th attempt boys!
Also, guys please do RHPC games again on the second channel.
Spyfall, I dare you, Draw tweet etc.
Please.
Daina is an integral member of RHPC, and we thank her for her wonderful dedication to her craft. THANK YOU!!!!
Dear Ryan, can you do a parity to Avengers Infinity War/End Game
Diana is absolutely a 10!! I love her so much 😍 You don’t see that side of Diana at all, this was an awesome podcast 🙏🏼
Is, Ninja Melk available in DC?
I fricken love Daina. Her story of realizing she knew Greg really early in her life before actually meeting him in High school by coincidence is super awesome! I can relate. My boyfriend and I discovered we were in the same middle school and social studies class in 8th grade, 5 years into our relationship!
Daina has a sweet little voice🥺
So when can we get this in South Africa?
Keep growing your beard out Ryan!
Very interested in trying Ninja Melk but I'm from Canada and shipping is $53... Anyone know a way around the excessive shipping prices?
Consistent uploads. Ryan is a beardy changed man.
You know Ryan you look like a member of (block b), just saying 😏
Daina is a solid 10! Girl I love you so much!
Oh my god. That story with Daina was hilarious! XD
Do no do dear Ryan anymore because I was just about to ask something
Ryan: We don't say those kind of things to you
Paco: Oh really?! Pulls out long list
Daina is literally just a ball of sunshine! Just what I needed to brighten up my day - Daina is a 13/10 at worst
did skillshare tell you you have to read the thing word for word lolol? i liked your own version better but oh well, whatever gets you monayyyyy <3
Flawless transition to the shi shi break. Well done Ryan.
This is honestly the most I've ever heard Diana talk and I loveee it! I especially love that they get to know each other more through these podcasts
Grow out the beard so we can have memories of Sean's beard
SkillShare really is good i learnt a lot more there than in school i promise
Dear Ryan can you make Roblox the movie???
I would watch another podcast with Daina, Will too!
can you put podcasts on Spotify
daina!!!! i love daina so much she is such a sunshine 💖 DAINA ID A SOLID TEN
She's like Rose in Two and a Half Men lol.
Sorry, I really adore Daina, but the way she talks makes me feel so impatient... This is not me trying to be mean, it's just something I thought I should bring up to facilitate the flow of the podcast better. Much love to you Daina! Perhaps you were nervous telling your personal stories, appreciate you for sharing nonetheless!
She is lovely and definitely a solid 10!!
Daina is so cute and her voice is so sweet. I love her voice especially when she is laughing and encouraging people because it is soothing and sweet at the same time ^^
daina is a 10, ryan is a sexist, thank you guys for the podcast!
God bless Daina. She must be protected at all cost !!
I know you don't need so much view, but you can open a new channel and upload all podcast their.your channel content did not match with this
Dear Ryan, can you do Avengerz: Brane Game or Avengerz: End Game? IT WOULD BE ULTIMATE LONG TIME FAN SERVICE!
I saw ninja melk and clicked immediately
my god I haven't been on here in awhile since u made how to become a singer and how to be a ninja the first one and u have 21million subs I have been here since 800k congrats dude congrats
I hope we get another podcast with daina. She is so sweet, chill but also funny. I feel like she seldom gets any spotlight in RHPC videos so seeing her here was super refreshing. Also her voice is super soothing to listen to. I enjoyed this episode a lot:)
Daina is surprisingly funny 😂😂 i have good laughs watching this podcast, 💕❤️ love you Daina 🤗
Dear Ryan can you do a video telling how you feel about ASMR or do a ASMR video?
Diana you are one of humble and kind person in a team, I really waiting then Ryan will invite you to podcast. Looks like you are person who really a best part for Gregory and you brings to RHPC team something unique and important. Coz all members a super creative and with it they are difficult people, but you i thinking makes everything soft and understandable. Like bring some charm energy to male cave.
Daina breaks my scale. She's MORE than a 10
She's so sweet...I enjoyed hearing these stories.   Great podcast again💙  and Daina is a solid 10
the informal meeting of daina and greg reminds me of a story of a married couple that has a picture of one of them (i believe the husband) at disneyland as a little kid and in the photo off to the side is the wife in a stroller with her family and this was years and years before they actually met. congrats on 15 years, that’s an amazing amount of time to be with someone and i truly believe you two are soulmates from all daina has said in this podcast! 💗✨
WAIT i need to tell you guys something soo i went to  Old Donation University and I found a picture of a student and will playing the guitar... so I found will at Virginia...
Super cool that Daina used to work in arch/civil!
DAINA is A solid 10 more than paco!!😂😂
ok, I'm confused...one can of ninja milk is 25 dollars? Or am I missing something obvious? 😂
I saved a paper football from my middle school crush 🥺 it got a bit smelly of hand sweat but I finally was able to get rid of it. I moved away to Texas so im sure he’s found someone. Lmao good memories 💕
Daina is so pretty and sweet! She's a 100000
Y’all should do a parkourse podcast or another episode
I've never clicked on a video so fast, finally we got Daina in here!!!
Ryan you should make an off the pill podcast YouTube channel
i found the 'im making my own energy drink" in exposed
DAINA IS A 10!!!! Only OG's can relate. Absolutely loved this episode!
if dairy didn't kill my stomach 
i would have  ordered some :(
What if Ryan went off the pill (for ADHD) but put the person being interviewed on it??
I clicked this the second I saw Daina in the thumbnail. I love her so much!
I LOVE Daina. I'm not just saying it because of crazy Paco. She's a real ten inside and out... Love you Daina!
Every one I used to watch Ryan higa back in the day and I thought his stuff was good but now I love this podcasts, they are so calm and later back, really relaxing. 8.28 did you guys think yep I’m younger than 15  and went down to the comments to see what other people say, I know that doesn’t make sense but hey whatever, also I see along of comments talking about Daina and to all of you I completely agree anyway this is pretty long, Ryan keep up the great work and I love your stuff really nice and chilled back, my new fav thing to watch on YouTube
“Maybe you’re a guy” Daina is really DANIEL
Daina is so funny.
She is a 10
What is ur least favorite video you've made
Perfect cut when Daina was explaining why she liked him Ryan and Paco were like WTF
Ryan, more microphones. Definitely, Daina should be part of the Podcast team. She's great.
Love Off The Pill, keep it up guys!
Why is paco so mean to Daina? She's literally a sweetheart!!
Next week is Mother's Day. I think we all know who the guest is gonna be!!

Never stop making podcasts. People who can't watch them are poppyshows
Congrats Ryan for passing the Prebeardy stage :D
Nah dude,Daina is an 11
Dear Ryan can you do the 100 push-ups a day for 30 days challenge
Interior designer ???? 😍 daina is definitely a 10 now
If it's produced in the Netherlands you should really try to setup European shipping. It's probably being created an hour away from me at most but I have to pay 65 dollar shipping to get it back to where it's produced.
Bring back parkourse it was lit
Ain’t gonna lie.. I saw the thumbnail and said Markiplier??!!?? Lol!
to open chips stealthily you slit them with knife.throw them on a book,under the desk.easy lunch.
Ryan's evolving stache from episode2episode lol
Yooo lol, Ninja Melk was the short film that him & Sean made Years ago!, Right?
Dear Ryan, make an Agents of Secret Stuff 2.
Can someone compliment on my YT username?
daina's just lovely <3 a solid 13/10
honestly not even for the secret ending and stuff, but Daina really IS a solid 10\10!! and now even more that we got to know her better! Daina if you're somehow reading this, you're straight up awesome and anyone would have the utmost pleasure and honor of being friends with you! =D keep it up and wish you and Greg all the best ^_^
The moment when Daina sighed and Ryan looked at Paco killed me.
Daina is an ELEVEN at WORST! <3 <3 <3 Shine giiirl...shine... xD lol
do more parkourse
daina is a perfect 10/10
Ive seen Diana in BTS videos before but never really got to see what she was like irl, turns out shes a complete sweetheart! What a trooper, hope to see her again at some point on the podcast! +1
Daina is ICONIC! 💕
Hey kinda wierd and random but can you play Minecraft again .... I mean it's just nostalgic ... Not completely irrelevant since it recently became a meme .... 😅😆
36:30 G E K O L O N I S E E R D
Please forward to Ryan the suggestion he transliterate Jukiya.  The Western world aches to understand.
Podcast is really getting better every episode. Thanks for the video.
Daina's the most underrated member frfr
Vlog Vids Please!
Daina's a strong 10
I love your videos and your movie I've watched the movie just because you were in it
You guys should really sell those lightsticks though!! Like on your merch shop.
Damnnnn the awkard silences

Great viddddd btw, keep it up!
Dear ryan can you do the 100 push ups a day for a month challenge like t* Hepi said
Daina was the best guest! And she's definitely not a 3, she's VERY attractive!
Dana is a ten bro , Paco just mad cause he isn't, Paco is at least a 7
Dear Ryan, can u do a magic trick that will impress me?
YEAYY YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE RECOMMENDED DAINA AS YOUR NEXT GUESS!!! And it's finally here 😭😭😭
Edit: daina is a solid 10 btw
Can you please do more older videos like parkourse and cooking but not really. Also, like the skits you made with bts like "the cardboard" and "man vs wild"
Daina is such a solid 10 adorable and quirky♡
This is by far my favorite podcast
Diana is so cute I love her🥺💓and I loved learning more about her
You come to the Netherlands with anything milk related and they're on board ԅ(♡﹃♡ԅ)
Dear Ryan,can u do the ghost hunting part 2
Your name was mentioned in coranation street
tbh daina is just a 10
YES! i love daina, she's always behind the scenes. Daina, I hope you know how much we appreciate your hard work and love you put into rhpc :D
I mean who hasn’t stalked a crush or two
What’s dainas ethnicityx? She’s so pretty
Can you do a another parkours video?
i wish the podcast wouldve been longer, id have liked to learn more about dainas past and experiences. shes so sweet and well-spoken and her laugh is so cute. also, i really like how daina and ryan interact. its like a big amount of tangible mutual respect going on between them, i think they understand each other well idk anyways daina is a 10 inside and out
Get kevjumba on off the pill!
Dear Ryan: can you prove Wyoming isn’t real?
I was surprised Ninjamelk was made in the netherlands! I mean melk is a dutch word as well, but congrats! And Daina is so cute 😊
I miss the dear Ryan Q&A
Daina's Doodles is such a cute business name! You should totally make that happen. 😊
The thing is how do you justify an hand full of metal waste for like two sips of apparently slightly above average energy drink.
I don't normally watch these podcast things right away, I usually put them on my "maybe I'll watch it some other day" list but since it's Daina, I'm watching it. I've loved and admired her since stepboys
Dana is the best lol Paco is forcing his humor too much
all my teachers are cool with eating in class. it's lit cuz i be hungry
“Daina is a solid 10.” 😬

Also we should stop rating people’s appearances with numbers....it’s weird
Dear Ryan 
can you make a parody of avengers endgame?
Daina is a solid 11 !! Love you girl
Daina is now confirmed to be one of my spirit animals. Wishing you all the best!!!
Question for Ryan:
Is ninjamelk going to ship to the Netherlands???
Ninja melk shipping is $75 rip
Dear Ryan,
Can you make a magic movie in real life, like Harry Potter?
I am so excited. Finally, it’s Dana! I love it ❤️
I love these podcasts so much I've seen all of them and I wish they were longer :D
LOVEEDD STORY TIME WITH DAINNAAA😂😂😂
I loved your video in the olden times nigahiga, but you aren't what you were before, now you what to do what you please, you don't even work on your videos even more. Your videos became blande after you uploaded the Fornite Fake indroduction. I hope you can read this message.
Diana is a 10😍





She is so pure uwu 😬😬
...... but the yandere vibes........😬😬😨😨
Awww daina even made a stand for the pill
Agents of secret stuff 2 please

Daina is a solid 10!!!!! No but like she really IS!!!
Pls do more dear rayan vids I don’t like thes new ones
Hey RHPC! I really love these podcasts and I usually listen twice (once in youtube and once in spotify just so that they are marked "played" and also because I enjoy them so much!) I also want to add on something about the way you read your sponsor thing, I think it can be better. I listen to Conan O'Brien's podcast too and I somehow enjoy their sponsor reading although most if not all of the products are based in US only (I'm in Indonesia). Maybe you can get inspired from their podcast for the sponsor reading? Love you guys! 😘😘😘
This podcast was so short  but really comical
Ryan I think it’s time to shave bro😂😂
Does NinjaMelk taste like yakult?
Ryan is not shaving......best i am taken Pringle sign ever 😂

daina is so cute omg. she's so nice and she'd be so fun to talk to :)
Daina is awesome!  Purple Elephants!  I really like the podcast
I have always genuinely thought that daina was the prettiest girl thats ever been  in any vids since rhpc 10/10
How long to a video that ain't a podcast!
Ryan’s views always go down :(
congrats !! 🙂
Where is the mvp who breaks down the podcast and tells us what they talk about
why would there be? Daina is so pure
Daina must be protected at all costs!!!!!
DEAR RYAN, can you PLEASE send me some NINJA MELK?
23:30 Ryan,  yall shud do a skit & reanact this as an anime in real life.... yall got the equipment to make this happen!!

No lie they should have a podcast channel (popthepill) for this quality content 👌👌
DAINAAAAA!! THE SPEED OF HOW FAST I CLICKED ON THE VIDEO OMG I LOVE DAINA!!!!!!
Daina is a solid ten (no writing this because paco said)
Daina and Greg’s relationship is basically as old as me. That is crazy.

Daina for sure is a solid 10/10
Best. Podcast. Ever.
How did Ryan not mention hinata
Daina is the sweetest! so glad that she's in the podcast!
"Dainas" is the 10, A SOLID 10 XDD
I do the opposite of daina, i avoid as much as possible the person i like and pretend they dont exist but im trying to work on it, if i like a person im now able to actually speak to them and make eye contact without shaking or getting nervous
Daina Is A Solid Ten!
Ryan with facial hair....give me back my 2006
i want to buy that energy drink and im from the netherlands but shipping is 60 dollar so if i'd get 12 of the cans it would be 90 dollars i want to try it but thats not worth it
Hey could you make a low carb version in the future? Would love to drink these while on Keto/low carb diet!!! Loved the podcast guys!
omg Daina ...... i am a final year interior architect.... it feels like shit. I don't think I'm going anywhere with this (seriously). THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
Todays fact

Daina is a 10.. a solid 10❤️

It's all podcast now? Where's the dear Ryan and the fake trailers I missed those ;-;
Honestly. Daina is a 10.
🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳❤️❤️
Make a video about her story. It would be great. Greg gets the girl at the end.
Right now this and the JennaJulien podcast are the only things that keep me productive as an artist and I am incredibly grateful! Pls keep it up forever.
Diana is a 10! Also I am totally the Paco of my friend group so I relate
I hope we get to see the making of the room someday! Would love to see Daina's creativity in the making!!
Paco should get punched in the mouth, Daina is very attractive and hella cool.  Of course it was Paco that said it, so gotta take it for a grain of salt haha
"Hope you're knee gets soon, buddy"
Bruh I saw Daina at the mall once and I literally choked and I regret it so much
melk means milk but u probably alredy know that
"Daina is a solid 10!!" We need to hear more from her!

Daina is a 10, a solid 10
I was one yrs old when Daina and Greg started dating lol
off topic, but the more i think about the title of the podcast the more i think that it has something to do with birth control
OwO what's that in the yellow trophy stand behind Daina?

27:45 i wish i had that Scenario where i stayed in the same town and reconnected with a friend, well the only difference is id probably remember them, but no, we had the big move to Texas (from Oregon) and then after that we moved all around the DFW area, the only connection back to Oregon is Family and Church friends
This was too short!!! We need to have daina backs another time!!!
Daina is a SOLID 10/10
The way Paco described Daina in the earlier podcast was misleading
Love ur vids
What the hell is this show? Red hot pepper chillies? How did it come up on my feed? Why is all this highschool memory time feel so familiar? I think I like it here.
Dear Ryan, can you make a video about black hole?

I lived in Korea and we had a lot of Makkeolli! The white rice drink that's really popular. And in Japan they have Pocari sweat that's really exploding in popularity, and they have more drinks with milk mixed into it. Greetings from the Netherlands ;)

Dear ryan do tiktok for twenty four years
You could tell she felt hurt because of Paco's joke.
Paco is so mean 😂😂😂😂
Today's fact: Three-fourths of the earth is covered with water. When astronauts first saw the planet from space, they could mostly see water, so they called it the 'Blue Planet'.
the sound glitches a little in dainas part where she speaks, or does that just happen to my sound/phone? :0
36:07 is Ryan referring to Makgeolli (kKrean rice wine) here? It has a milky texture like ninja melk I believe.
Dear Ryan, can you play some more games with the crew
Paco is like a 3 but if you factor in his personality he's like a 2
Change my mind:
Pancakes are better than Waffles
I remember one time in class a girl farted super loud and everyone including the teacher just pretended like nothing happened and then Like a month  later a boy farted in class and everyone and the teacher  were grossed out and the teacher shamed him for it It was funny at first but after a while I just felt bad for the guy
Who's here because there's Daina??
We nEed a BGA cOmeBacK

Me: So, is Daina ugly.

Who knew a 9 year old short film would turn into a energy drink
well girls are told to be a "lady", look presentable and look pretty so of course they don't want to talk about farts and pooping even though its natural...
Daina is an 11!

Daina is a 10, a solid 10

Daina is a Solid 10 !!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Dear Ryan Higa,
I've been a lamp since the beginning of time, and I have loved seeing you grow as a very big youtuber over all these years. But I feel like something off. You don't post any more skits or anything. I love your podcasts, but I miss everything else too. I don't want to tell you how to do you're channel, but ever since Sean left, I've noticed that the skits have gone down. I'm really happy you post consistently now, but can you maybe do a little more skits? I know they're a lot of work, but if you could make a regular video maybe every other week, then all the original lamps will watch more (because I've also noticed the views are going down too) Thank you for your time (if you're even reading this)
From,
GrimmReaper
we don't want daily uploads we want funny content
Dana is an 11
Please have Dana on again, I didn't realize how great she was until now!

Daina has this charisma when she does her story telling that it just wants you listening more. It's has a nice narration to RomCom with the female lead cause she has a sweet sounding voice like cheery.
Daina is so kind to Ryan and Paco even Paco being mean to her. I hope she can appear more on the screen.
Daina is a 10, a solid 10 <3

Like Daina's idea that they learn something off skillshare (each of them could pick up a skill that they find interesting or arent good at or just for fun). I guess it would be quite an interesting video.

Paco is mean but not really hideous (joking). I think he acts meanly because he thinks other people are mean to him when they are actually not (they are only trying to help him). He needs a positive self image, and see how his friends are really trying to help him not put him down. And Diana is very attractive. I have seen Monica too.. in Gucci gang, musical parody & one food tasting video. She is different kind of beauty and Diana is different. But Diana is very attractive too! Duh!
She is pretty

Hey RHPC I work at Best Buy in LA. If you need anything I got you guys
It was very cool getting a little background on Daina. It seems clear how present she has been, but she always seemed so silent and somewhat of a gofer. This was yet another lovely edition of Off the Pill.
I need to see Greg from when Him and Daina first met

I’m sick and tired of these boring interviews. Ryan is not a TV HOST, and comes off really stale and dull. Hope he continues videos that aren’t Off the Pill.
girls shouldnt be allowed to just fart whenever because neither should guys. as a guy, i've never been around other guys who just fart randomly, watching this channel is like an anomaly for me where you guys exude the stereotype that guys fart and belch around their friends.
Daina is a 11

Paco’s humor goes along with KSI’s a lot.
KSI:*mumbles on his words*

Paco: you're a great rapper

Lmfao🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is the most down to earth KSI I’ve ever seen lol
Kudos to Paco for studying up so well on all the guests.
I highly respect JJ for doing his thing and not giving shit about his income. You can truly tell that he has passion towards his drafts.
You've been consistently uploading for over 10 weeks, are you okay Ryan?
Dear Ryan 
can you make a parody of avengers endgame?
“Everything we were saying was truth”
I really loved this video, great to see other people for seeing the real JJ. I’ve been following and supporting him since 2010 and it’s great to see him get the recognition for being a nice guy that he deserves.

If KSI makes a movie, Ryan better be In there 😤😂
Ryan: There’s a certain demographic to listen to a podcast. 
Me: sitting at a desk job all summer at an empty University. 😐

😂😂
Lil bored are you here😂😂
Being able to watch nigahiga AND Ksi in one vid for an hour??

Lemme get mah snacks 😂
This gave me a WHOLE another perspective of ksi, keep in mind I've been watching him for about 3 years.
Dear Ryan, could you teach us how to crack politically correct jokes?
Big ratings for Ryan at 8:12
Didn't want to make KSI feel bad for not knowing what the saying was, so just proceeded to act like he didn't know it too, although I'm very sure he does.
Im here from lil bored
My guy has a man beard, prebeardy vibes?
He got his inspiration from the OG gamer group called the crew when Kyrsp33dy was and others where going ninja defuse and etc...
I love how nigahiga put jj's 2nd channel in the description
i hope this channel lives on and gets past its struggles, not sure what's going on with the whole money situation or copyrights or demonetization, but i hope things are going good for you guys, this is the only podcast i like, and i've been watching you before i even knew how to make a youtube channel, keep up the podcasts, really enjoying them
The Crew. Speedy, sidearms, D20, D4, shadowbeats and g18 is the gaming group ksi was talking about.
Damn. It's just amazing how many things were explained by KSI that have never been fully explained. This podcast was amazing and very entertaining.
KSI’s introvert in 16 yo is literally me right now at 16 yo...without the googling stuff
Ryan can you get mr beast[jimmy] on the podcast plzz
3 great guys and content creators sitting in a room, talking for an hour and 5 minutes ☺️. What’s not to like?
dear ryan pls make a movie about mobile legends
Whether or not paco has been a frequent casual watcher of ksi videos, or he just did last minute research, i think he needs more credit for knowing so much about each new guest that appears on the podcast and just being on top of it all. He is killing it. GO PACO GO!!!!!!
I ve been a fan of Ryan's since 2010 and I love these podcasts. I love the skits but thess podcasts are a breath of fresh air. BTW Paco s doing such a great job. Keep on going, guysss
Now this is my kind of podcast. What we have today ? 😎💊
Sir Froge if you see this put this in the video dad
Usually I hate podcasts but this was really chill and you guys made it interesting fair play
U know Lil bored and sir froge r going to make a video on this 😂😂
Count how many times JJ said LIKE
37:11 "what if he's really good?"  bro, It's DAX!
I'm sad that Ryan's doesn't get a similar number of views on his other podcasts
1 hour well spent
Ryan staying strong with the beard! Don’t give up!
Damn paco is a great interviewer
KSI: making a video
His Brain: Personality can be whatever I want.
Halfway through, please bring up pewdiepie
I wasn't expecting you and JJ to do anymore collabs... 😭 this one caught me off guard lol
Since when did you start growing a beard, RYAN HIGA?
I love the Naruto action figure in the top left of Ryan’s camera 😂
I love JJ. he's such a cool guy. this video helped me know who this goofy dude really is. JJ is funny and actually has a very kind heart. he also speaks his mind a lot.. like I rly mean a lot lmaoooo. JJ, he's smart and knows what he's saying when he's talking about serious stuff. I truly thank him for being him. JJ I really appriciate you. love from Sweden.
who else wants to see rhpc and the sideman form a super squad
KSI said in an interview,I think it was WHAT'S GOOD podcast..that NigaHiga was his inspiration..he used to watch him before he got big. Respect to both of you.
Much love to you guys, watched you growing up, still a big motivation seeing you guys still growing, keeping it real 💯
I wish i could podcast with JJ and nigahiga cause you guys are hella calm
Petition to get pewdiepie on this
Nobody:
Will u be doing another I dare you or Parkourse with any of the Sidemen?
i dont like how this one feels like a interview. i rather watch u guys talk about random stuff
👍 this if u want JJ and Logan to colab. Even if it’s just a skit of them fighting.
First ever episode of this podcast I've watched, made me go from hating KSI to respecting him as a down-to-earth guy.
It’s meant to be: 
Two OTP Podcasts 
THEN a GOOD, entertaining video.
Woah, Ryan has a beard




Edit: Yes I sound like every other comment ever, but holy shit, this is my first comment over 1k likes! Thank you so much!
Ryan Looks Better With A Beard

KSI: ESSENTIALLY
Been watching JJ since my mate told me about this “fifa heskey video” this has to be the realist I’ve seen him. So fresh and sick to see he’s actually a human, and not just a character. Mad respect for you JJ 👊🏽
I watched Ryan's video since I was 17, I'm 25 now and I really like these podcasts
I've been watching you since the How To videos and I love this podcast! I look forward to them coming out, I think the variety of videos makes you such a strong youtuber because its not easy to make podcasts interesting
WAIT WHAT IS THAT NEW ENERGY DRINK  I SEE ON YOUR TABLE????







Ninja Melk FTW
Duhh?! When will you make actual videos?! 
We need more Dear Ryan(s)
I thought your eyebrows fell down but it was just your lip fluff 🔥👍🏻
I’ve watched (mainly listened) to every episode of this podcast all the way through whole at work, and I’ve loved every second. Glad you all decided to do these. 💯
imagine covering da hyper x logo dafuq
I learned something today.
KSI and Paco have the same humour :)
Please bring back parcourse and cooking but not really 😁😁😁😁

Like you agree
I LOVE your podcast, I get excited for the next one! You do you Ryan!
Ryan has been to India!!!
Hell No I missed that opportunity.Guys pls about that visit.When?
Woah, Ryan’s beard is... growing...
1 ad in a 1 hour video
I rate it

Edit: Appears to be some other number ads for everyone else.
holy shit ryan looks 10 years older


how far into the future did you travel, man?
Hour long podcast: 2 ads. Bravo Ryan 👏
This is such a good podcast. Deffently looking forward to see more good podcasts.


Much love to Nigahiga and KSI!
really liked this! Watched all of this whilst playing some games.
This was way more interesting than I expected.   I liked seeing this side of JJ.   Very confident yet able to credit & compliment others (sometimes lol)... like his honesty.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
I've been watching since before i had a youtube account, i still love this content ^^
love the direction your podcast is going in. Keep up the good work
Amazing video so good to watch this feel 100 blessed
I will forever be grateful to KSI for making me find Quackity. He is a legened lol, that Discord Got Talent video ft KSI was by far the funniest video I’ve watched this year
just waiting for lil Bored xD
Hyper X Cloud Alpha, I know them when I see them but why u tape the logo? Lol
damn dude video vs just audio is like a whole 'nother podcast xD
Ryan went from 20 to 34 real quick
Wtf lol, you guys are drinking ninja melk?!🙏🏽
Dude, I'm part of your old audience and I've watched most of the podcasts all the way through so far, it's refreshing to see you guys chilling like this and talking about real stuff
"I respect the OG's I know most of them personally"
Honestly, I love this!! I related to way too many of the things said. I just became someone that watched his videos and anything regarding him usually regardless of what it is, a podcast or skit or whatever! I might be weird but oh well.
56:47 He talks about Quackity
For once KSI is doing a collab with someone not getting carried by him
I wanna be on this podcast
Can I?
Please?
Olajide "mmmm" Olatunji
Lil bored is coming for u😂
And yet jj copystriked my Roblox video
Why am I blessed for having an hour to listen to two of my favorite youtubers growing up speaking with each other for an hour!!!
I am really enjoying the podcast! Love this new content from Ryan!
KYR Speedy and The Crew Good old days still watch them everyday
Nice HyperX Headsets. Are they CLoud II's?
Paco really showed up for this one. He seems like a professional podcaster (if that's a thing) in this whole hour.
The Best Joke In Entire Podcast 1:03:03
This is y Ryan is amazing
He makes an hour long podcast and....
Only puts a n two ads
Do another Ryan tries pls
Everyone and they mama be doing podcasts😂
I’m honestly not a fan of KSI...never watched his videos before, but YouTubers who I subscribe to who talk about other YouTubers like KSI and kind of just showing the side of him that we don’t like, but after watching this, you kind of get to know the real him and he seems pretty down to earth.
I can't explain it that well, but I love to see Ryan interact with KSI and vice versa. Two very different characters, but yet so much respect for each other.
What are the figurines behind Ryan called?
That knowledge about them and the jabbawockeez just made this hour worth
PACO BEING VERY SERIOUS IN THIS VID, kinda giving me the chills!
Paco was the name of my bird am sad he died in 2017
Great Video guys, I'm an long time watcher of both your channels and love whenever you guys collab. JJ revealed a lot more than I expected in this video and really opened up also, which he seldom does. Quality interviewing guys.
I watched all ur ads that’s my gift to u.. oh and Hi Paco!
Watch it at 1,5 speed to save time for ur maths homework
Ryan & Paco need to watch Jaackmaate's video "The truth about KSI". They will realise how nice he actually is & how many people he has helped behind the scenes & never shared it on camera.
Finally You Interview Someone Relevant!!!!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE PODCASTS, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU WANT 
your fans will always support!
How did he NOT react abt ur name LITERALLY being NIGA HIGA XD
Lil Bored if you see this put me in the video papi
HAHA PLUGGING YOUR ENERGY DRINK!!!! NINJA MELK!!! 😂😂😂🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
That Naruto statue thingy looks dope :)
why i didn't watched this 'niga' before ? he's awesome !
DRAMAalert
I think this podcast is getting into the news
He's not very articulate. Nothing against him personally, I don't know the guy, but from an observation standpoint, he has a hard time constructing sentences.
KSI and Ryan together for a whole fricking hour
(Btw Ryan, well done - I honestly can't believe it's been 14 weeks and you're still sticking to the consistent uploads. Keep it up man!)
He says "like" almost as much as Jake Paul =P
Anyone here from all the posts on Instagram referring to this vid?
You should put clips to show what happened 😔
This was class! Good stuf Ryan
Your voice has changed A LOT (ryan)
KSI Swears 2 seconds later
 "Oh Sh** Can I swear"
every ksi interview ever:
constantly drinking his drink
Love this podcast👍👍Good way to make everyone understand the situations.
This trio is just…




Perfec-e-ecttt😍
Dear Ryan, can you bring back Skitzo please??? Thankkssssssss.^^
Should have shown behind the scenes (secret filming) so we see him being all kind and stuff :')
KSI should be on Joe rogan
Two of the YouTube's biggest icons for an hour

Perfect
My respect for KSI has gone up, he actually seems like a decent dude
One of the best podcasts ive watched. Paco is a G
" KSI Speaks on Jake & Logan Paul and the Sidemen (Ft. KSI) "

Thanks mate I thought it'd have been Deji on it
It's been a while since I've watched Ryan but WOW he sounds so different! His facial hair is coming in slowly but surely too!!!
Oh YES this gon be good. Finally some good content on YT.


grabs popcorn and snacks
Ryan please bring parkcourse back
Please like this so Ryan can see ittt
David Dobrik on the next podcast 👀👀
Ryan you should invite Andrew Yang to your podcast it would be awesome
Dear Ryan, 
Can you try flipping dominos
Ryan just said Paco was in the moderaotor seat... mod, pacos a mod. Its ok paco we accept you for who you are
Can't wait to see lil bored make a video on this!
Nice Video. And I rate how you JJ actually have a heart (soft) :)
How many times JJ says yeh 
👇
Brasov is actually a pretty big city in Romania. And very beautiful. Asshole lol
THIS WAS SO FUNNY - watched the entire thing!!!!
This is the first podcast I have watched in full. So entertaining. Great to see my two favorite YouTubers sit down and just talk.
I finally started watching your channel and the first thing I see is podcasts. Win in my book!

KSI talking about KYR SP33DY is awesome. i wish people knew the good ol days with The Crew
So now every slowly dying youtuber is now doing podcasts?! ;-;
Its not his videos only
His personality is another thing that make us the fans wants to watch him
Thats why he is awesome
Not his videos only
KSI: exists
Paco: SOFT JJ!
Was Ryan drinking Ninja Melk? and how do I get some?!?!
I rlly enjoyed this, hope they collab more
So now we know if he uploads a vid on main channel he needs a bit of money 😂😂
Two of my favorite YouTubers in one video 🤯
the part where jj said how he and the rest of the sidemen took harry under their wing is just so sweet idk why, they really care for eachother
It's really amazing to see KSI talking about himself and is actually happy in this video
This podcast was very fun. I've never watched a full podcasts without skipping before and this was interesting enough to keep me hooked especially because there were a lot of jokes but it was perfectly balanced with serious conversation. Great work.
RYAN WE NEED A COMEBACK FROM BGA!!!!!!!ITS ALREADY 2019
Please do a collab video with Hasan Minhaj
KSI AND RYAN AGAIN 

The Greatest forces COLLABING
Watched the whole thing 💪🏾
this is the first off the pill I've watched, and it was one of the few that I've been able to sit all the way through. Good job ryan and paco it was a great video.
Loving the beard mate.
well, "my new car" is still deleted cuz of copyright striking. i am so sad
KSI is one of the few people allowed to say niga
it would be epic if you manage to get Logan in after JJ's
DEAR RYAN I dare you to make a ASMR SONG
Why is paco so cringe today 😂
came for ksi and ryan. but stayed for paco man...entertaining mod
I was waiting for the moment when Ryan will go “damn man you’re double in size compared to the last time we met you” & JJ would’ve shouted “I AM BULKING” lmao
I like how KSI has improved these years ,getting close to belike pews,admirable
Love your old videos, and I also think it is more interesting, that you guys started podcast, because I like to listen and hear about your point of views. :D
2 of the youtubers I love the most cant believe they are making amazing content together
I like KSI, but for real Drake is just in a completely different level
KSI: Yea now we just collab with everyone 
NEXT KSI collab: MrBeast, PewDiePie, and maybe T-Series just because of Vikk
I just watched vidals vid and he said hes gonna train him again🤨
Ksi: me and deji are cool now 


Deji: makes diss track public



Ksi: am I a joke to you?
paco: says something
ryan: mmm
Do a Sidemen collab!
I was actually wondering how ksi is gonna control his swearing before watching this video
JJ is YouTube royalty 👑
I started watching nigahiga a week ago and then i saw this... my top two creators at the moment 😄😃😄😄
Can you make NINJA MELK 2.0
When both of your fav youtubers in the same vid 💯
wait hold up a sec... ninja melk?!? is that the new energy drink ryan said he was making? 👀
This podcast is one of the best ones! You should do one with Shane Dawson 😍
I watched the whole thing 🖤 and I enjoyed it so I’m gonna go binge watch the others 😂
Lil bird is taking notes right now........
Remember this guy was at the top of YouTube
Whole podcast is just Ryan getting updated on youtube drama....he just goes like "idk about that in detail but what was it?"
Lil Bored, im ready for a new video.
ksi: took a 1/2 year break
GradeAunderA: Peasant
waiting for that 'but its actually good' edit.....
surprised jj said jabbawockeez correctly
How do I get your energy drink I want some \^O^/
Harry’s disstrack line “your own label doesn’t rate you, and that’s the truth” deeep haha, he’s well better now though tbf, new album is decent
Ksi: this girl i liked walked by and i said hi and she said hi back then i shat myself 

Ryan: wait like seriously?
lmao
hi important question: do you like grain?
Lil' Bored is gonna have a lot of fun with this...
Usually not a big fan of podcasts, but I really enjoyed this one. JJ was so honest and himself in this it was great. First time seeing nigahiga and I really like him. Great video!
Sir froge and lil bored. Do your thing
at 40:00 JJ is taking about the whole boxing Weller thing and tells the story about how Joe tried to ruin his career - yet JJ was the one bringing up Joe's mental health. JJ realistically should've handled that situation better. Which he has since apologized for. But it still doesn't make up for this.


I respect JJ for making sure that he spoke about it but based on what we've been shown to do with the situation JJ was the one in the wrong in that situation.
I was eating garlic bread while watching this.. I feel good about myself
Infinity War is the greatest crossover event in history! 

Ryan: Hold my energy drink
Ryan looks so much more mAtUrE with the moustache
The only thing I think off. If you have the money JJ has and making the amount of money he is you can just go on holiday for 2 weeks and not worry about ANYTHING. 


But that's because hes worked hard as shit to get to that point
Whoa! Despite having a warning/disclaimers Ryan was still demonetized from the I Dare You video? TF?! No wonder Parkourse and the I Dare You died. Sigh.
I wanted them to ask more q's on his gf...
the red alert video actually costed 590k because the 500k beerus chain was in it lol
The sideman are the best
22:12 New Age Album : Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Feat. KSI x Maximillianmus
Brasov is an amazing town though!
I just love everything Ryan does, the best youtuber ever, so real, hardworking and talented. He honestly deserves a lot more love and appriation. Never fails to make me smile❤❤
paco : we were wondering where you went
With this beard you Look 20years older
So does this take place right after the first Sidemen I dare you???
Im sooo confused
This podcast is underrated, we need 9 episodes a week bro 😂😂😂😂
KSI is a BEAST!!! 






A soft hearted BEAST!!!
Keep growing the beard.
this guy still makes videos?
With the future question he was holding back saying pornstar😂😂
lil bored you know what to do
Ryan with facial hair?! 




Sniff sniff our little boy has grown up 😭😭
Dear Ryan, please do John Wick's parody!!!
Can the Sidemen do a collab with Superwoman.
Make a rules of survival in real life
Respect for keeping it real n shit lmao. You should just do you content wise and do what makes you happy
Everyone: I cant watch this, it's too long for my cramped schedule. 

Nigahiga: KSI is in it.

Everyone: Well, I can miss my flight and just book another, no biggie.
Ryan plss make more of your original songs I miss them
Never heard of KSI but definitely gonna check out his videos.
He seems like such a cool and fun guy. Laughing all the time even no one else is haha
DIDnt  TALK ABOUT THE DREADS?
Count how many times he says essentially
What if Ryan is off the pill...

But the person being interviewed is on it
probably a dumb question but
is the necklace that jj wears a sidemen one, xix, their anniversary?
7:29 The enthusiastic yes ever 😂
i dont usually watch podcasts but watched dis whole thing cuz its an epic collab of genuine dudes
Sideman were made cuz of The Crew ...WOW
I respect JJ so much more now, he is one of the realest
I respect JJ a lot more after this.
shoutout to the legend quackity
I legit just got home from vegas wtf!!! WHERE?!?!?!?
I can't wait until jk and Logan finish the second fight, settle down, and Logan and jj arrange to go on impulsive together
Also, this is the first non pg 13 podcast😂😂
Didn’t Vadal upload a video saying he is training KSI for the Logan rematch
Next one with Felix Let's go
Woah never expected KYR_Sp33dy to be mentioned in this vid.
this feels so surreal this being nigahiga, I'm constantly waiting for a twist
damn he's right bout the ads being gone.
Love it when two different type of youtubers that I watched growing up making vids once in a while is like YouTube gold man and my man Paco being more serious during this I like it
I miss the GTA days
Ik Simon is sick that JJ got on a podcast with Ryan before he did😂
since you're going OG, pewdiepie please
But.... the sidemen beef was fake tho
i actually like ksi in this video wtf
8:22 aww Ryan is such a sweetheart lol, "is that a saying? " to make KSI feel ok.
do a pod cast with teogames
Been quite a while seeing KSI's true side. Glad it was in 1 of your vids Ryan. Best collab with 2 of the greatest youtubers this year so far❤ Keep up the podcasts.

also 😂 Paco = KSI 's humour
17:18 Human.Exe has stopped working...
My childhood heroes in one podcast? Yes please.. legends
Be the person you needed when you where younger is my advice to you three.
1:36 wooow that's so racist, all asians don't say will like that lol
Thanks, Ryan, for these podcasts. Really interesting to watch 👍❤❤
Apart from the intro Ryan was silent for the first 4 minutes lol
Ryan looks better with a beard imo
Can u react to a nice guys dub me and my friends made? THANKSSSS MUCH LOVE FROM SYDNEY
Is it me or does Ryan voice sound slightly more irish?
58:20🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ryan: laughs I got demonitized
lmao ksi
"mmmm" "yeah"
Sidemen started because of the crew?!
"(Ft. KSI) Not like I didn't know that in the first part of the title.
JJ’s favorite word is “essentially”
That’s mad how nep got Harry into the sidemen! I wanna know who those ‘bad’ Youtubers are! 😂
Lol JJ forgot to say that Ethan came up with the name of The Ultimate Sidemen
That moment when JJ doesn't even know the history of his own group loooool
I agree with the fact that he seems so much more like a person then what I’ve seen. I absolutely hated KSU for a while, but now idk, I can say I have a bit of respect.
I respect Ksi so much more now because of his respect for music and his craft. Much love to this podcast and everyone on it!
you guys are a bit professional .... like i believe you could have been more chilled with jj
Sick his doing that with his music and it will also be great advancement for him
Hey Ryan, great episode👍, Yes Theory should be on the next
Im surprised the crew (speedy) inspired them to make the side men. EVERYONE SHOW SUPPORT TO THE OG CREW
This gonna be your most vieuwed podcast
so was this podcast, pre fight? I thought all of these were made this year?
I learned so much from here, thnx
DEAR Ryan can you make a nerf gun war video with the RHPC squad
Its ok paco we love you, i dont want you to leave. Respect for staying on the podcast.
I love Ryan, I love KSI, but for some reason I thought I wouldn't enjoy this... happily proved wrong.
17:00 KSI lowkey smart
You guys should colab with the misfits podcast
Cant wait for the LilBored edit
when they clapped in the beginning i thought someone would say ''meme review''
Ryan I’m happy for you man. I’m just happy you’re able to do what you actually enjoy and who you want to be. Been rolling with you since the “How to Be” videos. Thank you
Love these videos there so chill nice to listen to bcus use are genuine
Who else thought the stick man was a natzi sign? 😂😂
can someone count how many times ksi says like i couunted 11 in 1 min
Wth what you guys doing together. Im impressed.
Have a great day 








Also can I get a sub
OMG THIS IS THE OG OF YOUTUBE, HOW TO BE EMO & HOW TO BE GANGSTA. 😂😂😂😂 WOW THIS WAS THE DAYS
Dear Ryan, could you make an awesome song out of you and your friends laughs?😂😂
You guys are actually mental interviewers!! Was not expecting this to be so real ! Never seen any of your podcasts before or seen Paco in anything but you're genuinely really good at this (much better than the majority of youtuber podcasters)
Collab with David dobrik
I'm a Mongolian man from Italy that lives in Scandinavia.
You should get penguinz0 on a podcast
This was a good podcast having KSI just being his authentic self
First part made every boy stay
Hmmm if Ryan has a beard, Regina?
ksi should do a anime like dbz and voice over his own creative character it would be sick..love u..JJ
Your podcast's mascot should definitely be a pill whose name is "Off"
All these months I thought Ryan  stopped uploading videos.. it turns out YouTube just stopped sending me notifications for his videos..... wow...
Ksi was trolling saying he wouldnt fight Logan because he had fallen off... Great mind game JJ
You should do a video with end game
Dear ryan, can u do a epic bottle flip 2019
ryan you’re the best since 2009
It's funny to see Ryan quietly plugging his energy drink l o l
Paco was on fire in this podcast 🔥
He has a different laugh in this....💀😅
Ksi : I’ve been training hard for the fight



Harry in Twitter shows that’s he bulking where’s the logic
Ryan needs to grow out his beard. I think it would look so dope.
Ryan,honestly i dont like your podcast and i dont watch your videos more often now because of the podcast can you bring back dear ryan
Ryan’s voice sounds so much different on the podcasts compared to the vids
They didn't get behind your music? n!gga i wouldn't too lmao you a C+ Rapper
Because he shows he is a human like everyone else, then he is soft. What is wrong with people
Yoooo saving my actual comment for the reupload
Its funny. I watched Impaulsive right before this its cool to see their differences. And talk shit about each other.
2017 diss tracks
2018 boxing matces 
2019 podcasts
Was that label the time he seemingly he had a breakdown and wanted out of the lime light?
Never knew the sidemen were close to actually ending....thought it was all jokes .....great podcast
Holy shit. I never knew how KSI and Paco would get along so well.
U know what. Whenever ksi is not making a video and just talking real he sounds actually like a fun guy. He has a narsisitic side but his also being logical
When you realise jj is 1m of ryan😆😆😂
Why does ryan sound so much different with that mic
Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover 

Ryan: Hold my Ninja Melk
UK HERE like if your from the uk and watching this
You really understand youtubers with these kind of videos :)
dude this series is awesome, and i enjoy it. but i think ryan should make some other like, videos, like skits or other stuff
Damn that paco guy is cute
That beard looks awsome on nigahiga
JJ should know a thing or two about losing “babies”.
KSI X Ryan=AMAZING!!!
Ahh so that's how harry joins the sidemen
KSI laughs so loud and it makes me laugh 😂💀
He came to Brasov and i didnt know? LUL
Wait is ninja melk from that video Ryan made ages ago?
Lil board is going to make a dope parody
someone count how many times JJ said essentially :P
Saw ksi, so I clicked on the video
Ego starts at 18:00
lit ep bruv.
Podcasts are the new vlogs of youtube
40M subs in one room between 2 YT OGs
La Lamborghini im so fast you will think im hoodini
KSI: Ryan you are " Prebeardy " 
Ryan: Greg didn't give me his moustache...
I dare you with rackaracka would be amazing
I didn't even know this existed. Thanks youtube.
i clicked off when he said thanks for watching but remembered the breathing and came back
Ksi is probably losing the rematch if his cardio is good... You know who
The two og YouTubers in one video! HOLY!
1 hour and 5 minutes of ksi mumbling. content gold ladies and gentleman!
These two people will forever be my favourite youtubers. Two different content creators but both are down to earth people.
Loved every single minute of it
Love your podcast. Another podcast with KSI would be nice
please do invite more "old gen" YouTuber <3
Did somewone notice the ninja melk ryan was drinking?
I love dreads but... I couldn't stare at his for too long.
What recording software do u use?
"Were good now, yeah yeah. We sorted it."
          Well that didnt age well.
Well damn.... JJ is a sweet guy, under all that buff =')
No one : 
Jj : oVeR tHE MoOn
Lol flashback to when he claimed pewdiepie’s new car video which got taken down
Imagine in the future ksi becomes a pro rapper, actor and boxer
I wish upon the day ryan had a podcast with pewds. That'd have been amazing!
How close is RHPC personally? Like, what’s the difference between your work relationship, and your personal relationship with each other?

:)
lil bored gang where u at ?
now I love jj even more <3
waiting on Lil Bored Edit version of this wink wink
Jheeeeez Romania yh😂 props for remembering the name of the city tho tbh
Paco and KSI are the underrated Duo
Dear Ryan: lemme rephrase that and you’ll probably never see this but I’ve been a subscriber for a long time since your conspiracy theory trailer and skits days. I love your podcasts and please just a suggestion do  a my hero academia trailer❤️
I find it hilarious that Ksi thinks that he's even close to quadeca's talent.
Dear Ryan , can you try to speak some sentences in HINDI . 🐮
bro wtf how do you tell someone ur channelname  ?
Drink every time Ksi says "ummm"
Is Ryan possessed, consistent uploads !
where do i buy ninja melk
I never watched Ryan’s podcasts because I’m not really a podcast person but this was so good! Imma watch more now :P
Should have done a parcourse with KSI
Dude Paco saved the podcast so many times and stayed on topic. Real lad
Can you change your username so i don't get arrested for saying the n word
This is the only off the pill podcast I watched fully
Did anyone skip to the part where he talks about Logan??😆
Post more dear Ryan’s and skits!!!!

18:23 Nice little floyd mayweather quote
Long awaited collab
It’s so cool seeing I guess the”real ksi” I wasn’t expecting this at all. Watched the hole podcast and didn’t get a single bit bord😅keep it up
Sir froge it’s time.
There’s a YouTube channel called MOMO
Lil bored where are you  XD
Legends has it that Sir Frog and Lil Bored is editing this video to get views and KSI's attention
Ngl I think Paco should be a side "sidemen"😂😂😂
What I really want is a parkourse with bulking season JJ
Paco i love you bro, you're funny..
love listening to these while working
YOOOO Ksi has been to Romania and didn't say shiiiiit...
This podcast balance humour and serious things
was Ksi talking about KYR SP33DY
A lot of people like your videos, but mostly you post this, not a lot of people watch this
I kinda wished they would've brought up the topic of JJ completely ditching gaming with the Sidemen after his big break from everything because he never really spoke about it but nonetheless this was really solid
Say what you want about JJ but to be fair, he works his butt off and tries fairly hard on anything hes working on.
The first podcast video that I didn't double tap right to skip 10 seconds
"Fake things don't feel authentic" damn ksi so deep he must be a philosopher or something.
Is it me or what. Doesn't Ryan's voice sound different?
Did anyone realize Ryan's voice sound a bit different from when he used to record all the skits and everything? It sound more mature
Why does everyone make podcasts now
Is it just me, or does Ryan look great with a beard? Honestly, I feel like he can do any style.
That's really good to hear honestly. I wouldn't ever think KSI had mental breakdowns. Honestly that just like helps
Boy Ryan lookin rough
dear ryan, can u make a vid with reaction time plz?
Second collar with ksi
It's like my childhood colliding
What did he say when he asked about being friends with Logan
I have never watched a YouTube vid for an hour in my entire life but am glad to say this was genuinely worth it.  It was super cool to see a different side to jj.Two of my favourite youtubers.❤❤❤
"Wack a flak a" lmao
Amazing video 💯
I am an X-KSI fan. I used to love his old content back in the day. This video proves that he is still the same guy deep down and not just a big jerk that he appears to be normally today.
WOW wtf you guys didn't even ask him about his biggest beef with Gudjon Daniel.....
We’re gonna take a quick shi shi break and then afterwards discuss him fighting dax🤣
Podcasts with JJ are always sick.
Lilbored...its time
I just saw ksi and i was like, im gonna watch
when talking about Harry is he saying Nep as in Nepenthez or Net as in netnobody
Dear Ryan can you bring back ninja milk
How long have you been wearing that necklace
Great! now please bring kevjumba
Now we just wait for that one comment with all the time stamps
Omg Ryan and KSI together are amazing 💕
I've always wanted to know how they share the revenue from their merchandise store and the sidemen channel among them selves
KSI knows Nep? As in Nep like Sovietwomble and the ZF Clan?
I got an ad during shi shi break
this is such a good prodcast
Waiting for lil boreds video lmfao
I don't get why you just make podcast now
Dear Ryan....what would it be like to do the tasks of hand with legs and vice versa?
sir froge and lil bored comes in
I don’t have time to watch every single video but I just happened to watch all 14 podcasts and enjoy every single second of them. But I missed many videos especially recent ones, I haven watched them yet, because I have no time.
i miss the skits :(
PACO UNDERSTANDS JJ. Get married.
deji and jj are brothers because they both say 100 percent, yea yea
Does anyone know who Harry was "going down a bad route" with?
Rhpc vs sdmn in .... whatever really
Ryan’s voice deeper?
So kyr speedy started the sidemen
U should do a i dare with W2S hes fearless
why do they have to censor the hyperx logo on the headsets? like its obvious which headset it is :D i have the same one :D
PACO> Lawerence McKenna
I literally got popcorn and chocolate to watch this, 2 of my fav YouTubers in the same video 😍
Get Danny Duncan on here








Like for Ryan to see
17:21 lmfaoooo “words”
i used to watch you back in the days when you released nice guys and that kind of content, haven't watched you since, this podcast drew me back in. Enjoying the content mate. Do whatever makes you happy in life ! :)
Who are the people Harry was going with before the sidemen
i've gained some respect for ksi from this
Will you stop with this podcast. Its like listening to a radio. Non productive just talking bull. Do the stuff not talk
thanks for no aids when it comes to ads
1st time i watched a full podcast
This is actually fun.
When my to favourite YouTubers collabs ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I predict ricegum is gonna be next
I've never actually seen one of your podcasts cos there's so many, but they're not bad i suppose
why do I feel like paco took over the show... but in a great way
Ksi has similar values to Ricky Gervais somehow
Is it me or did his beard grow hella fast all of a sudden?
Also, Ryan looks more like a dad
thanks nig(g)a
Seeing JJ's soft side was so cool. Like Ryan and Paco said, he never shows that in his videos. It was nice to see he's "human" too, and hear about critical things that happened behind the scenes. Very inspiring.
bro im am from brasov why didn t u tell us ksi ooo
JJ is actually in denial about joe trying to ruin his career 😂  He literally did take the piss out of depression on that stage, Joe just reacted and pointed it out. He talks like Joe made it up or put words in his mouth. Delusional
Idk why, but Ryan looks like a Hollywood film director.
oh boy, the "yah yah yahs" are back.
Deji: MY BROTHER DISSED ME?!?!
Dear Ryan can you make a parody of Gucci gang
Great job by all the lads
is it wierd that i watch this on 0.75 speed just so i can enjoy the podcast more?
I love your other vids tho
Omg KYRSPEEDY was Sidemens inspiration loll
Is it me or does KSI here sound like Thor?
Camera angle on the guy with red shirt feels weird asf
Paco being serious. Lol
Nothing says insecure like trying to prove yourself to people. Nobody should feel the need to go through all of this to feel good about themselves. I can only hope that you figure out that life isn't all about recognition and proving yourself, just be yourself.
Actually a podcast where everyone talks and not a fourth person, barely saying anything....
KSI said "like" 983 times
Realize how almost every Off The Pill video has less than 1 mil views, but when ryan does skits he gets more than like 2 mil
can you pentap really good?
I'm getting Thor vibes from KSI's voice
how many times does he say "for me " lol
Why does Ryan’s voice sound so different in the podcast? Doesn’t seem like it’s the same in the regular videos
I like the podcasts where you all talk equally instead of mainly interviewing somebody. You don't get the same creative ideas.
Who else got an ad during the shi shi break
U should do one with rackaracka
21:35 trust me
lil bored joined the chat
Now I Realize that Dragon Ball Z or Super helped JJ alot.(LOVE YOU TWO BOTH)
I rate KSI for doing what he wants and not listening to anyone else 👊👊
DAAAAAAAAMN RYAAAAN WITH THOSE FACIAL HAIR! NOT SO PRE-BEARDY NOW
I hope Lil bored edits this haha.
I think this is the only podcast I’ve ever fully seen
Whats that mic?! And that Mic arm too
8:37 what you came for
Do more videos with Miniminter
17:22 words





Paco: Ur a good rapper
Me:damn!
Lol he forgot ethan😂😂😂
We all know lil bored bout to jump on this.
Dear Ryan
Can u kill thanos
You know i just found out this podcast an logan does posdcast TPB does podcast Mark dohner, other girl all the new cats Og from the past are doing the same, music is the same style beat-lyrics kindda whats the new.
Im gonna do something differently.
KSI, Musician and Boxer is there no end to his talent
god i can hear that thumbnail
idk but i think nigahiga is irrelevant 😬
9:07 training to fight logan ha more like eating to fight logan
Drinking game for the above age people (so not me)

Drink whenever KSI says "yeah"
Mom's Basement w Banks and Keem is his first US podcast
Paco has really come into his own
I wonder if jj said hi or akneehow to ryan
I’m so grateful that you can do an hour video with only two ads
Later 
Paco: 'Alien entry 155'
humans can be humane but that doesn't mean they have a soft side.
😂
It’s so good that the sidemen are still actively trying to do things together and keep the group alive
I want now about the net nobody beef if that was real or not
ksi showing his soft side is probably the best thing he can do considering that it's a new way to connect to his audience that isn't common for him
I miss old Ryan. its nice that you are doing what you want but its not the same
Hmmmm I wonder why they never got behind that music ay....
what every math teacher should tell their students

nigahiga + Ksi = Quality content
Still trying to work out how an asian got away with (very successfully) calling himself nigahiga. To this day... to this day.
Timestamps would be nice
2019 = year of the podcasts
Damn, now I want to know about how w2s went down a bad path with other youtubers
Ryan seems a lot more happier doing these podcasts and he uploads every week. I love it. One request: We need an Indian guest on these podcasts Ryan... Please!
I bet lil board will re-edit this 😅😅😅
I like how KSI’s link in the description is his second channel.
damn Ryan that beard better than JJ's
Love this channel
Always knew Ksi was going on this
Is it me or did Ryan’s voice change?
Dear Ryan can you prove the moon is made of cheese?
The crew !!! 🔥
Why is Ryan going prebeardy? Is it for another video
Ryan seats are better than logan seats
KSI: yeah my bro and I are good. 
Deji: re-releases diss track
KSI: Am I a joke to you?
the only problem is that I don't have the time for an hour
Damn....Ksi looking more like lil yatchi than lil yatchi
Dear Ryan, can you fly on a paper airplane?
please do some more really creative videos like the dancing without moving.
KSI's laugh is so contagious omfg
59:52, Mr beast reference?
Dear Ryan can you make a classic version of old town road
nigahiga is a cool youtuber and so is ksi. This podcast is ............amazing,hype,fun
When he brought the OG gamers of YouTube like speedy nobodyepic all them if you know the crew you’re a beast
Fastest way to success is to fail again and again
Any video with ksi in it will always be entertaining, funny, and intersting. That is what i love about ksi! He's just the best ever!
Wanted to know more about how you met
I actually watched all of this
Wei Walt a house tour!!
I feel paco was on good form in this one 👍
I miss the skits but if ryan is happy with the podcast then im happy too
Why don’t you get your brother on the podcast?
Damn, I like KSI even more after this video
Fact on 2 ads
"find myself" hahahahaha
Can we get Pewdiepie on this podcast soon? Love you Higa!
Dear Ryan: Can you sing like your favourite artists for the 3rd time?
DEAR RYAN How to write pro comments
U should've ask if we stop making forehead meme will he host meme review
This podcasts was very entertaining good job ksi and nigahiga
Linsanity episode?
When he said we don't like social media drama and half towards the video is bringing the heat.
Anyone else just looking at the two figures and waiting for their head to sync up all the time
Oh look hardly seen Ryan with an actual moustache and a beard xD
My two favorite youtubers
dear ryan can u make a code geass (anime)  parody or season 3 trail
Ryan when are you going back to making normal videos
honestly, ur irrelevant 😂
2 Ads 1 hour video feels bad
Bruh he said he is always trying to be himself so then why did he do that whole transforming bs saying he wanted to stop being a character
why is only Paco speaking majority of time?
Got my popcorn ready, it's gonn be good 💖🖤
It was nice listening to KSI, I haven't watched his videos yet but I think I will try. About the topic of end goal in terms of what to do, I would say I have watched your previous content and though it was exceptional, I liked it very much, it seems that you were not all that happy making it day in & day out. For these videos you have to work from home all 365 days a year. It must be stifling. I am saying that because when I had a work-from-home job, I felt like my life is ruined. I would see the sun & trees outside and very badly want to go out and ultimately do something that does not confine me to home. Outside is good. Really. So, I would give this (unsolicited) advice to all youtubers-- make money for some time & get out.
paco is really good!!!
“For me” - KSI, 3456 times in 1 hour
0:24 👏👏 meme review
I’m glad you guys do visuals with the podcast unlike many other podcast that are just on iTunes
But also respect for ksi
I wish JJ was like this in SDMN vids
Loved it you literally lit it get it
ksi's face when he heard dax was 6'2
Immediately after I heard pako talk about  Harlem shake I was like bruh I miss franku max idubzz and chad together. Imagine if Ryan could bring JoJi
Erm first podcast in the us? Are you forgetting about moms basement?
yeah, thats crazy
get a kirito(from sao) figur next to the naruto figur
Wait so are you gonna go on Logan's podcast next, or is he gonna go on yours?
Imagine the scenes if Jj went on Logan's podcast lmao)
i like these podcasts to be honest
Ryan sounds so different in podcast
What’s shi shi
Im so out of the loop cause I did not know where I knew his guy from....and then I remembered the scare prank
My 2 favorite youtubers
Interview Suggestion: Yousef “Rose” Erakat. Now that he is back on YouTube there’s still lots of unanswered questions about everything
I was waiting for KSI to say "hes planning on doing porn" next lol
Ryan do you go to Tokyo boys anymore?
Ryan's new energy drink i think? Ninja Melk? (37:28)
If that's the case, congrats man!
I don't like Jake or Logan but you should be on their podcast or you should bring them on yours podcast, it will be jokes let's see what will happen.
dear ryan ar you a wolker? i am the wolker #31042
Ryan, when and where can we start buying off the pill mugs?
I'll skip this one.
Ok wait I came back here after like 4 years of net watching and- Ryan is like.... hot uM
just wait for lil bored to do a edit on this xD
Bro why’s Paco so soft
Woah,Ryan has a beard
I think ksi has to much money in the bank since he’s like not doing it for money 😂
Lol impaulsive is next level
ksi is really smart by not sharing everything it is what makes him a good person
really KSI thats a low stoop man lowwww
LOL, He came to my country (romania) for a girl, LMAOO =)))
Ryan looks like mj in 2009
love the podcasts
No they called themself the ultimate sidemen since that was what the clan on GTA 5 was called then rebranded to sidemen later on right?
I was thinking about the ODDISH plant behind ksi the whole time
LOGAN POOOOOOL
Lil bored better be on this right now.
so harry joined because he was going down the shady path of selling fifa coins
Really gotta give it to paco !! he really does excel in this and I like him as a host a lot !!
literally watching reactions to ksi’s ares diss track and this comes out
dear ryan What is school for ?
get pewdiepie on the podcast
Why are every big youtuber have a podcast just think david dorbik,Logan Paul,nigahiga
You know damn well, that ksi has too much money to even care about it
this was actually a realy good video
Paco and JJ collab and abuse vikk 😂😂😂 sorry guys I’m high
I am not a KSI viewer, but after watching this podcast, I enjoy his chats :) cool guy! Thanks Ryan for showing this side of everyone
"like"
Ryan: Has an of the pill podcast channel

Still Ryan: Posts podcasts on main channel
nice beard Ryan !
I dare you with Mr beast. Bet he wins.
Hey Ryan this is just a bit of advice for titling the podcasts and also advice that's about where you plan on taking things with your content.   On YouTube if you title any video with "conspiracy theory" then sadly YouTube will just automatically demonetize your video and will slightly shadow ban that video as well.   As for the future of your content we can already see much improvement in the quality and in your mentality.   Ryan you haven't burned any bridges and you always naturally had that spark of creativity since the how to be ninja days, so I think if you instead of just looking inward I think you should also try to semi recapture the the childhood wonder that helps breed creativity.   Even if you feel like you have to do a disingenuous topic then just execute it with what you personally would find funny and not just trying to please your fans.   Noel Miller is good for you to see different types of comedy to load up on new ammunition/understanding of different crowds.   You should do that smash improv sketch thing but instead of the typical bullshit you all stoned as fuck and then do it haha.   Good vids lately Ryan.
Akneehao! God I can't stop laughing at that video 😆😆
Make an "I dare you" video with the sidemen
Does Ryan’s voice sound different than his old videos like 8 years ago or is it just me?
I want you guys to come to the UK, specifically Scotland!
Why does he sound so different
miniminter gonna be pissed
erri one doing podcasts
Please ask Daina for this
Ryan pls sharp your mus
For real, He relly deserves the name KSI
Does anyone else feel Ryan treats his friends badly. Like I love him and all that but I just get a feeling he talks down to them or doesn't appreciate them.
Dear, Ryan can you change your voice?
Why the headphones?
Can u make other video
I love your dear Ryan videos
THIS VIDEO IS JUST ENTERTAINING
Before 1k 😂😂
Where is  the part logan and u become friends???
Dear Ryan pls do a horror scene but in real life
Lol I just watched how to be ninja and gangster
Wow i watched the whole thing the heck
An ‘ I Dare You ‘ with KSI would be a banger!
is this a podcast channel now
I’m confusion, didn’t they already fight? Ksi and Logan
I don't know why but nigahiga reminds me of Eusebio's 91 rated card from Fifa 19
Still has a GTFO sign from 2013 :) 😂
Post more often
Wow ksi famous as hell damn
Calabe with sidemen
Not doing interviews
dear ryan, can you make a movie of MEME
Damn this is the first of Ryan’s podcasts I’m watching and he’s changed...

Ryan’s moustache.
Dear Ryan please make a trailer for the last nigatar where the nigatar is just a niglet then he becomes a nigatar and please say niggardly at least once. Please find this Ryan!
A punch for each ornament
Shoutout to Nepenthez
Dear Ryan how did you start learning your dance moves and flips
lol headsets hyper x alpha cover it up xD
Should’ve also down one with Simon because he’s a fan. He would’ve been like “where the fook is parkhourse?” Lol
does anyone know the company of jj t shirt?
Dear Ryan, can you make a troll video??
KSI said everything he and harry said in the diss tracks are true, which means he just admitted to doing cocaine
U has beard now
jj said he's god in the face to face with logan, and now he said that he's also human. what a liar
yeah yeaaah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah yeaaahahaha
How many bananas did it take for you to get KSI on the podcast?
Did ksi just say that killing a baby would be sad? 😂
Ksi speaks....but still ft. KSI :)
Dear Ryan, can you fight a bear
Any question 

Ksi : I think.... time
Yeah this podacst is just sick
didnt finish yet but who came to watch KSI breath into the mike
He has a girlfriend!? 😳😂

Paco out preformed rayan completely
never clicked on a vid so fast
Separate off the pill channel?
Separate off the pill channel?
Anyone else get the vib that he is trying to hard to act human but is actually an alien or was it just me
Paco is a work horse. Grabbing his opportunity to make something of himself. Big up to him
so deji just got the diamond play button
Great podcast Ryan, Paco and KSI !
Favourite youtubers together
Why does everyone have these Hyperx headsets? I bought it once, thinking they are ok and now I see them everywhere, anyone know why?
I’m waiting for a lil bored edit
Who was KSI referring to when he said W2S was going down a ‘bad route’
U need to have 100000000 subscribers
Ksi on and day,rain or shine,at any point in time.. EVER....(super loud distinct ksi laugh)RAH!! FAM!!
I love this
Ryan doesn't even mention his own new drink in the entire 1 hour podcast, what a legend. As his fans, I feel like we should just do it for him :D (He's too modest for his own good)
NINJA MELK IS RYANS NEW ENERGY DRINK! 🤭
'Losing a dog is like losing a baby' - KSI 2019
The reason he’s not beefing with Quadeca as much is because he’s scared of him lmao (his rapping not size chill smh)
\👑/
\W2/
 \ S/
He went to Romania lol
For real tho, Ryan’s voice is very similar to kakashi sensai from naruto
Really nice to see a sweet side of KSI
he did moms basement so this isn't his first in the us
Didn’t ksi put a video saying the beef with sidemen was fake
His user name is the n word !
Do parkourse
10:45  12:40  15:28  17:20
Everything we were saying was truth.... hmmmmmmmmmmm
23:16 "why would I put my burden on someone else"
I hope my man Simon gets to do this as well, his dream will get fulfilled more
I miss the skits it is not the same
Dear Ryan Can you make a really dark backstory
Paco is awesome
Losing a dog is like losing a baby but he kills babies everytime he forgot to pull out
They both are one of the biggest youtubers and I would love to see just a collab between them forever (maybe slogoman too). I know it can't happen but it is perfect in my dreams
EDIT: Ohh and Paco he has the perfect humor for ksi and Ryan
where do u live?
dear ryan can make a pirate video
ksi can be a good actor because he acted like a raper for 4 years
Paco did a fantastic job as a co-host this podcast!
I clicked when how to be ninja 1 came out
This podcast was sick.
ksis mum should have taken the pill
Ryan and Paco are amazing podcast hosts. The off the cuff lines they come off with and the sincerity in what they are saying is brilliant. It's the first off the pill podcast I've listened to but the quality of the content they are producing cannot compare to other smaller UK podcasts.
KSI cracks me up just with his hysterical laugh.
So no one is gonna say anything about Harry?
lil bored is coooooommingggggg
damn he was a fan of speedy? ik its just a fact but that is crazy because there was a point before all this youtube clout bs where everyone was killing it in their own lane with no drama and hate and that's when KYR was super hype.
SPPPEEEEDDDDYYYYYY LESSSSGOOOOO WHAT AN OG YOUTUBER
We need a "yeah yeah" counter
Racist! Bcs your name
Can u start making skits again
Good thing about KSI is that he thinks before he speaks. You can see that by him waiting a couple seconds before answering each question
21:00
Shave that moustache bro....
Hey do you like green?
When u have a final exam tomorrow but Ryan higa uploads a podcast... Ah shit here we go again
11:02
Get Pewdiepie on this podcast,would be a great collab
Its wierd seeing nigahiga being himself, not that happy go lucky, confusing character he plays on his channel. Lol
21 mill subs and still no popfilter smh
It was so entertaining i didnt even notice they were like teehee
Dear Ryan, please play more Spyfall
Forgot about Ethan. F.
Interesting✌️👌😃👏🙌🙌
Dear Ryan, can you make a parody out of products like Flex Tape?
What the ....!! Haha. Noice XD
Dear Ryan....what is time......not scientifically?

Dear Ryan: Are you Asian Hawain or both?
Watching this video while KSI is retweeting ppl
Dear ryan can you do another you laugh you lose jokes challenge
KSI Making vida with the sidemen: 😂🤪🤣🤬
KSI in this video: 🤓
When you put ksi in the title twice for them views
When you remember that ksi's mum said that she would smash niga higa in a deji's smash or pass video and he was the only one she would smash...
KSI seems like a really cool dude I enjoyed this podcast it was nice to get to know someone who I knew very little about.
The video was great but can you spend a day like a woman?
KSI says he is training but...
I'M BULKING!
What a crossover.
22:12 KSI GIVING SHOUTOUT TO MAXIMILLIONUS
two of my childhood YouTube’s, what a sight.
I don’t know if you’ve heard of DanPlan but they did 2 “podcasts” where they played a kind of d and d game and I thought it would be awesome if you guys did something like that
Yeah Impaulsive has a better set and equipments but guess what they dont have



Paco and Ryan.
Mike is the most irritating guy ever and Spencer is the most awkward guy ever.
Bring back dear Ryan and skits
Man I miss mail time and park course and all those things and board games
Get David So on here
I LOVE THE COMMENT SECTION
Great vid as usual! Good to see two of my fave youtubers collab!
DTRIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it's the man of the moment I learned everything from NigaHiga and thanks to him I came out of my comfort zone I'm about to make 1 million .I just created my channel youtube under sharing my projects my first video arrives in 45 min I would like a member of support and comment to have your opinion subscribe to access my channel at once thank you
Awesome, awesome podcast.

Lil Bored Should Definitely Edit This 😂🔥
Dear Ryan can you turn old town road into a boy band song
Dear Ryan can you turn old town road into a boy band song
I want bretman rock in the off the pill podcast please
Ryan’s going through preBeardy again 🙄
You don't own Labels... Labels... Own. You.
instead of going frame to frame have everyone in the one video
KSI: Oh yeah yeah
More more more more more more dear Ryan
ryan! Pls do more episode of ghost hunting!
The Crew!
So thats why KSI hates weller, fair enough
KSI trying to explain how the sidemen started: well uhhh this happened..........no i think this is how it happened........how did it happen again??? 😂😂😂
This my first one, can I get a end game spoiler in the chat pls.
I love the way KSI doesn't let anyone else speak. Lmao
It's easy to say it's not about the money when you already have all the money you will ever need for 10 lifetimes
This is just like impaulsive
Good podcast!
30:08 Romani?
Imagine ksi on impaulsive(Logan Paul’s podcast) LMAO
This is a cool video
Dear ryan can you make how to be superhero.....please🙏🙏
get mr beast
Dear Ryan, can you remake infinity war trailer?
I love these podcasts so much. I don't even like KSI at all but I watched this all the way through. Keep going with these, Ryan.
Years????
This is like when Eminem said he is gay on the interview
Ksi t-shirt is fire
I can now see why KSI doesn't want to be signed to a label.
Idea: why don't you just put these off the pills on Higa Tv. That way the people who like the traditional Dear Ryan vids don't have to wait
I hate how JJ act dumb in sidemen videos but has an actual intellect in this video.
Ksi did seem real more human than usual in this
Moms bedroom?
First early saw ksi had to click
Ksi is always a big person to have
I've never seen KSI this wholesome.
Is Ryan ok?
Geez, nigahiga losing viewers cause he isn't doing skits anymore? Whack. They're killing it right now. Keep it goin guys
Yeah mmm yeah yeah mmm YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!!



Sorry, i was just subtitling the video
i like that other guy
Kid
Sees
Ignorance
So this is what you do now, damn haven’t seen any of your content for over a year now
I wonder where lil bored is?
I want Ryan Higa to fight somebody. If KSI and Logan can fight, I want to see Nigahiga. And he can probably genuinely battle. Alex wassabi is looking for someone to fight, but I feel like Ryan would destroy him
Get Mr Beast!!! Like so Ryan can see
I’m the only one who wants to rematch to be in August?
Cant wait for little bored edit
Use some Rogain or something Ryan, your beard has been shit for years and honesty I’m tired of it
KSI and Ryan did a podcast together? Drops everything for this
Dear Ryan: please do a my hero academia trailer
Now they have  to  have  Logan  on the podcast
18:08 NINJA MELK
Dear ryan, could you do another 'proving that.... ' type of video? Something like the illuminati one would be awesome!! :)
I can't wait til Ryan surpasses h3h3 and rogan in the podcast world. He deserves their level of fame much, much more than they do.
KSI laugh is great
Dear Ryan, can you make a TEEHEE! parody of ME! by Taylor Swift?
logan paul is beta male
Akneehow comment section
"How to talk to girls and what to say after hi."





My search history in a nutshell.
paco was the star here for KSI
I think KSI and Logan Paul are similar in the way they both want to make the most of their lives and try a lot of different things with and without youtube.
Amazing
41:10
Ryan and Ksi need to do a skit why do I see sidemen vs Ryan’s team and something along avengers “sidemen assemble “ like wouldn’t that be cool sidemen vs Ryan avengers theme or something even a skit would be cool because Ryan is so creative it be way to cool and then the sidemen jokes and all be way to insane
Can someone please link me to the channel hes talking about @56:47?
ksi:- yeah yeah yeah
sup dude
Today's fact: The Flintstones was the most profitable network cartoon franchise for 30 years, that's before The Simpsons came along.
JJ HAS A GIRLFRIEND???
What about the sidemen diss
Why does it say ft ksi when the subject of the tittle is ksi speaks on etc? Thats like being a band and going hey guys were blink 182 and heres our song dammit ft blink 182.. Know what I meen? Seems kind of redundant if you ask me, but hey ive never watched this channel or any of its content so maybe im missing some context to how your channel is structerd. So if im missing something here sorry in as advanced, very enjoyable podcast.
More dear Ryan videos
Is Ryan being sarcastic or not because I remember his voice full of sarcasm but welps, this is my first video on off the pill sooo idk😐
56:47 who is that?
Ryan returns
hid dreads look like ginger roots
Pretend i said something funny and like this comment
i like this
Get miniminter next time pls
11:12  don't bother
KSI Speaks ft.KSI KSI is speaking KSI
Let's be real, KSI makes music for people who don't really listen to that much music
why do I feel like he doesnt know that if it wasnt for the money, he wouldnt be able to make sick stuff and do sick stuff...
Collab With Jknews!!!!!!!!!!!!
WACKA FLACKA
£90k on a music video is crazy money nowadays. Big labels don't even invest that kinda money in music videos now. They spend most of the money on touring and we get like a tiny budget of 10k to 15k or something to make some big artsy music video. I've worked on so many music videos where they've just been favours and only got paid travel expenses -.- It's awesome JJ invests so much money into music videos to get the awesome results and the crew get paid properly! :D
Spoiler for endgame:




Hulk dabs
My name's ryan
Basically to sum it up, KSI just doesn’t dislike anyone he just thinks he better than them.
please make some comedy videos Ryan
Lowkey i thought KSI would go "HAHA your dog died lol"
Get pewdiepie on the podcast.
Dear Ryan, Can you make a dear Ryan theme song
I’m pretty sure that KSI’s and miniminters inspiration was nigahiga, so for JJ to sit down and talk to his idol.... that’s amazing...
What happened to nep
Ryanhiga is vanossgaming btw
Was wondering if they were gonna post today then instantly got a notification
Did JJ just admit he does coke!!!!!!!!!!  7:48
Brașov ah?
GREAT PODCAST

The rest of your 2019 is BŁÉŠŚÊD. Like and Sub To activate.
Sidemen parkcourse
KSI is right ,I can sense Jake paul is real bad person. He has bully mean attitude and worst thing is he doesnt acknowledge it. So,it will take time for him to realize and be real good human being.
Ksi laughter is like a 🐖
what is momo?
Notification squad where you at?


I’m a streamer trying to hit 100 subs btw thx

Ryan THE MAN LET'S GO OFF THE PILL EVERYONE!Wooooooo
Damn paco is on a roll with those fire jokes
i could just put these podcasts on loop while cleaning the house.
knowing how easily distracted ryan is... i wonder if it was hard for him to concentrate in the conversation over the amount of "like" ksi said... it was hard for me.
An ad during shi shi break?
Genius
Why is KSU staring at his mic the whole time
gimmie a shot everytime ksi says yeah i dunno at the beginning lol

Heyyy, I'm an old fan.. I just returned to watching ya like a month ago.. honestly, you've been doing a lot of "off the pill podcasts". You're quite different now.. no offense.
When u realise KSI ruined the PG-ness if this video
Who was wandering what the sign that has gt on it is
literally
Please please get Ian and Hila, Pewdiepie and, I know its probably a long shot, Idubbz on OTP!!

LilBored, you know what to do
Literally got my uni math notes out, snacks, drinks and this video just playing. The first offthepill I watched and it was not bad.
DUDE, YOU DID PODCASTS 4 2 MONTHS. STOP
A chair for each word
'Punchline and actual punches' should be a thing!!!!
The camera view hurts my head
Can somebody upload a CC for this video, but only the KSI part?
I understand nothing except his African-British-downSyndrome laugh.
It should be easy because half of the time he's either breathing from his mouth or laughing.








Also, anyone reading this, calm down. 'tis a joke
Who do you think was Harry about to go on a bad route with?  Who would be the "bad" youtubers?
2:58 u copy strikes Pewdiepie video tho
Dear Ryan, Can you throw your laptop out of your window
Not going to lie. I really dont want to watch this one because I think Ksi is an   obnoxious douche bag but I hope this will change my mind...
“Me and Deji are cool now” this aged well
why does KSI laugh like scooby
Who would have thought...
Quadeca is way better as a rapper but KSI is more entertaining
Did KSI become more black?
This break was the best podcast =D  lets gooo. ty for sharing all of u
JUST SAying quadeca is way better rapper than ksi

they are not even comparable

not saying ksi is bad
hes definetely a better youtuber than quadeca

but in rapping quadeca is one of the best rappers in the world
jj is nowhere near him
u should do more podcast with youtubers
We love you Ryan!!!
And KSI too
Dang Ryan is growing out that Chinese guy mustache
Such a humble guy🥴
KSI's lauging is super contagious!!! HAHAHAHA! He seems like a pretty cool guy.
Ryan, please do podcast time stamps next time
But the sidemen beef was fake?
This episode feals heavy
Can’t wait for lil bored to edit this.
Off off off off! To watch something else cuz this guy is obnoxious to me. Peace.
What a missed opportunity you didn’t ask him “How much chuck what a wood chuck if the woodchuck looked like you” ??
KSI hates Deji
Stop it

Dear Ryan can you make a video of Paco actually making all the trickshots he's missed? In all of the trickshot videos.
I like how the podcasts are progressing every time.... I'm enjoying them a lot and I'm glad Ryan does too. Paco is also doing well with asking the questions and leading the talk, good job!
Oh god I really love this podcast😂😂

KSI’s Song - Encore was on Power S3 E6 at the end and he was signed to Island Records at the time and they didn’t even tell him that they got his song on a massive TV show like wtf
Dont cuss...
Didnt ksi do a podcast with Keemstar and Faze Banks? False facts
Seriously your beard makes me sick, no offense.
Wait...  Ksi copystriked pewds a long time ago
Ryan seems so relaxed and open in these podcasts because he's doing what he loves and I love that
when paco isn’t there: “paco is really good at talking and continuing the conversation and...”

when paco is there: “paco shut up”
Every podcast seems to always have a “Roast Paco” section
This podcast is always talking trash to Paco lol. Just know we love you Paco!
You can see the smile on Derricks face when they start talking about avengers after breakup talk....
Bring KevJumba next please
me: *clicks on podca-
ryan: THE AGE OF CONSENT IS 12 IN THE PHILIPPINES
Ryan: "People don't know this but Derrick's been in china for the last month"

Cut to like every podcast and BTS video made while derecks gone: DeRRicK's iN ChInA wITh tHE JaBOwAKEeZZ 😂😂
Daina & Monica for the next podcast 🙏🏻
No one : 
Ryan : The age of consent is 12 in Philippines
GROW YOUR BEARD!!!
Derek is so underrated! Glad he’s getting the recognition he deserves!
Ryan: avengers is coming out
Derrick: aw snap
 
The irony
Bring d-trix on the next one 🙌
I've never heard Derrick speak seriously before lol
Much love to Derrick and Erika .... we all loved you both together but life happens and I hope you'll both be in happier places
Paco’s watermelon print shirt is my new aesthetic
Can you cheak up on Sean on face time. We want to see how he is doing
Bro I relate so much to Derrick, the whole thing about not wanting to tell anyone your feelings and blocking it all out. Another great podcast!
Ayyy Ryan’s controversial facial hair’s making a comeback
I’ve missed Derrick! Glad to have you back, this was an entertaining podcast
What happened to Derrick and the aliens? Thought you guys were saving that for when he came onto the podcast.
Anyone else feel like “Off the Pill Podcast - LIVE” would be a cool thing
Dear Ryan , PLEASE GIVE YOUR THOUGHT OF LIL DICKY'S EARTH 🙏
“I’m not the only one who gets naked in the group”
“Well you’re not. I won’t say who it is—“
I’m betting dats Greg XD
PACO get naked often???.....HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THE GROUP????????..
those first 15 minutes were pretty brutal for paco. must be hard to keep pretending to laugh it all off
26:15
Ryan: Avenger's comes out soon
Derrick: Aw snap


I was dead
"The patches look cool bro. They make you look unique." LMAO this is TOO bro
"You cockblocked yourself" - Ryah Higa, 2019
yes YES YES been waiting on this podcast since Day 1 (which was 13 weeks ago, damn Ryan, we’re real proud of the consistency of these podcasts - keep it up man!!)
God I love these podcasts. They're so refreshing because I feel like they talk about so many issues/dilemmas that a majority of people go through on a daily/weekly/month basis with their friends, family, and even themselves. Also, these podcasts do such a good job of just reminding me that regardless of who anyone is (doesn't matter if they're rich, famous, etc.), everyone is human and everyone has different strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. :^)
Me: Aw yeah Off the Pill # 13
Ryan: THE AGE OF CONSENT IN THE PHILIPPINES IS 12
Me: closes tab
D: You want to watch GOT with me?
P: You gonna break my heart? 
D: Maybe.... 
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My friend group has like 3 pacos 
We fight all the time
I’ve never heard Derrick talk so much
dear ryan,
can u do a podcast with the whole RHPC crew
The reason Thanos can't just created extra resources out of nowhere is because of the law of conservation. You can't create something out of nothing...
I love that Ryan started doing these.
Ryan, if you really want to grow a beard without patches, try castor oil. I mean, it's possible that you get pimples from it, but it's supposed to help with hair growth and it really helped with my eyebrows and eyelashes. (Personally I think you look better without a beard, but of course it's your business and not mine)


About the break up thing, didn't Paco already say like 1-2 years ago that Derrick and Erica broke up? (And Derrick said it too)
Flint Michigan still doesn’t have good drinking water YEARS after it was brought to light and that building got enough money to fix flints problem by a lot
Endgame spoiler:





Thanos gets arrested for tax evasion. That’s the entire plot
Idk why but that Paco voice is actually really soothing😂
I was told two podcasts ago that you'd discuss aliens with Derek and there were no aliens :') Please talk about alien conspiracies :3
We love you Pac0!!  w/o you RHPC is incomplete
Bro I'm Christian and I thought it was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
I think most teens drink alcohol illegally because it gives thrill of doing a thing you shouldn't do.

Where I live, the legal drinking age is 21, 
I drank more alcohol before turning 21. 
After 21 I rarely drink.

But once the drinking age has been lowered and people can drink alcohol which is readily available anywhere and they can even drink with their parents within the safety of their house.

The thrill of drinking alcohol goes away.


I don't know I maybe wrong.
Derrick is absolutely my favorite I've been waiting for the podcast with him just to watch him talk cause he rarely does that! 😂❤
man I love y’all 

I don’t know but ya managed to make a damn podcast entertaining
*me a pinoy clicks on Ryan's podcast

Ryan: the age of consent is 12 in the Philippines 
Me: I didn't even know that.
I am so intrigued by your conversation about reducing the population. I think criminals that are serial killers and Paedophiles should die.
derrick seems so different on the podcast
Derrick is one of the most interesting RHPC members 🤔☺️
Detectives - Explain yourself

Ryan - The age of consent in Philippine is 12
Dear Ryan can you make your own Avengers 😁
Derek: you wanna watch game of thrones with me?
Paco: u gonna break my heart? 
Derek: yeh
Paco: then no
Dear Ryan
Do you know Yandere simulator?
Dear Ryan, can you make a makeup guru tutorial parody type thing 


(  I thought it would be funny for you to do)
Aww I love Derrick and Erika both as a couple and as people on their own... of course we'll all support both of you through this
woah i’ve never heard derek’s voice so clearly and i’m not complaining xx
Can you make video about the advantage of being lazy?
Ryan with a suspense???? like avengers and GOT isn't enough to kill us??
It's more fun in the Philippines, I guess
Am I the only one that just listens to this insead of music when doing hw?
RYAN ROCKIN THAT STACHE THO!
RYAN, GROW THAT BEARD. WE BELIEVE IN YOU, YOU CAN DO IT!!
Does anyone know the shirt Ryans wearing it looks pretty dope
I Love your patches Ryan!!! It looks amazing!
Spent 2 days on Cotai, found out a few hours before my flight that the Jabbawockeez were performing. Missed opportunity!! 😭

Glad you guys killed it!
I watched that how to be a YouTuber video now every time I look at Derek I see boggers in his teeth
How close is RHPC personally. Like, what’s the difference between your work relationship, and your personal relationship with each other.
Paco is part of those low percent that either hasn't seen Marvel films, The Office, or Game of Thrones.
This was one of the most fun podcasts of yours. Really enjoyed it alot. And yeah, welcome back Derrick.
Paco seems very dilussional about his personality like he's swears he's funny but his friends are like nah 😂
And staring SneakyShrimp hehe╮(─▽─)╭
This podcast taught me so much about Derrick. He went from being my least favourite (in comparison) to possibly my favourite. Derrick is a mood.
Huh... I always thought the saying was "We'll cross that bridge when we get there". Ohwell, the more you know!
I don't mean to be rude, but i miss the timeline guy.
I actually felt bad for Paco while Derrick and Ryan bashed on him
Dear Ryan 
Can you make a video of how play cricket ?
I’ve been watching Nigahiga since 2014, but this is the first time I’ve ever seen Derick talking seriously, haha.
These the type of friends I aspire to have and be.
Bro love the podcast! It's so nice to finally get to know more about RHPC outside all the skits and videos and know more about y'alls experiences and life. Definitely feel much more connected to the RHPC crew. Keep it up!
Ryan: let’s just say.. I won’t need this cup anymore 
Me: omg.. he’ll be on the pill
Who else loves watching these podcasts? These are so underrated.
26:15 - 32:05 is where the endgame theories are
Ryan: I got 22mill 
Larry:I got 100k
W H O O P I’m glad this podcast is one of the longer ones😄
MORE MORE DEREK ! It didnt feel like an hour
Y'all deserve a bigger table ,stage and bigger audience...this talk show thing can go big😉
Finally the podcast I ve been waiting for...Derrick❤
Derrick is really good on the Podcast. Definitely consider having him onboard often!
but this Podcast is Amazing tho, and Ryan should keep up the osm work!
Bro I freakin love Paco’s shirt
Let's cross that bridge when we come to it. Ok yeah
41:42 
Ryan: We are digging ourselves a hole here right now.
Me: Yep, but you a funny dude, so I forgive ya lololol
"We will cross the bridge when we cross the bridge"  - Ryan Higa
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it."
That's how I've always heard it from normal people.
I didn’t know Derrick was this articulate! Loved how he’s so humble and stuff.  And such a soothing voice as well!
Lol these podcasts always roast Paco in some way
Shaving doesn't do anything to grow your beard. Use minoxidil if you want help growing your beard
Yea, there are definitely different “rules” or etiquette in different countries. In India once I got yelled at for accepting a gift with my left hand and not my right hand 😂
Damn has it been so long since an actual video that he grew a beard😂
DEAR RYAN,
 CAN YOU DO EVERYTHING TRICK SHOT
Dear Ryan, please do another episode of Reginers and Seandies/ Pacies 😅
Wait that’s the age of consent in my country? My parents told me it was 18
I love these podcast❤
Keep them coming
I don't know why but I feel like this had been the most fun podcast you guys have ever made so far! Like the other ones are super fun too, but usually I could still listen to them while working. This one though, man most of the time I just wanted to laugh so bad that I'm not even working anymore for a couple of minutes and just straight up listen to everything you said (I usually listen too but usually I can still focus on both listening and working).

Anyway, I just found out that the way I think is kinda similar in a way to Paco. I know you denied that you don't usually watch mainstream movies and shows, but at least the fact that you didn't means that you're not interested in them as much as other people (could be wrong about the GoT thing though), and that's how I feel too. I don't deliberately avoid them, I'm just not as interested to them as other people. Also the club thing, I thought I was the only one! I like meeting people but not going to clubs or parties where I don't know most of the people there. I went to a club ONCE in my life and it was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. The only fun thing was because I went with my close friends and we had a sleepover afterwards. But yeah that's pretty cool cause I literally thought I was the only person who thinks like that!
well paco is my favorite rhpc member :-) 
we love u
Also the saying is:
"We'll cross the bridge when we get there"
I'm lovin these podcasts! Also, Endgame is almost here!
A wise break dancer once told me: "Sometimes you gotta experience the bad to appreciate the good."
-Dereleek 2019
I haven been living in Guangzhou, China for 2 years and I can agree what Derrick said 😂
Derrick knows what's up. AVENGERS ENDGAME!!!
when u have headphones on and the o-o-o-o-off the PILL!! part blows ur eardrums lol
These podcasts just fly by! Loving it :)
Ryan seems so condescending to Paco but apparently he loves it so im happy for him
Macau is actually somewhat different from China, people still need to go through customs when they enter Macau from China or Hong Kong...
No one:
YouTube: How many comments are you gonna make in this format?
Ryan: the age of consent is 12 in the Philippines.
This pod cast makes me feel like I actually have a friend thank you
WAIT...Derrick and Erica breakup ? U can't just say it give a disclaimer first man.....
for the ppl who dont like this show GIVE THIS A CHANCE
me: on my phone
mom: get off your phone!
me: you don't understand, Nigahiga is posting videos that are soo cool!
....
mom: ok. CAN I WATCH????
I honestly love every vid ryan makes, there's always so much effort and thought. Congrats on everything you've accomplished, and keep the amazing content going
Ron Jeremy or Mia Khalifa for next podcast
Let Derrick talk about aliens... I was waiting for that😭😭😭
Ryan as Iron Man
Sean as Captain America 
Will as Thor
Derrick as Dr. Strange
Greg as Hulk 
Diana as Black Widow
Paco as Hawkeye
Ryan seems to be insecure about the fact that he stays in most of the time, even though it just seems like hes an introvert
Yay!! Finally  Derrick in the podcast👍😌
First 


if u get that u are the real lamp
If Ryan want to watch something unique, he should watch jojo, now thats unique.


BTW people that edited their comment to say "thanks for the likes" should get banned from life.
Just watched 2 of your podcasts in a row ❤️❤️ I love them so much guys!!
Wanna watch game of thrones with me?

Are you gonna break my heart?

Yes.

Then no.
I'm so excited for endgame I've been trying to preorder tickets
Hey Ryan, please do more "I Dare you!" i miss them so so soooo much, i feel </3 that we have not seen any i dare you for a while :(
Dear Ryan, please do another episode of Reginers and Seandies/ Pacies 😅
Dear Ryan, can you bring on the Twinjaz to the podcasts? 🙌🏼
Why they gotta roast paco everytime😂! Paco is cool AF!
Dear Ryan, please do another episode of Reginers and Seandies/ Pacies 😅
Wait Kukui means cool?! Professor Kukui from Sun and Moon?
this podcast had me cracking up 😂
Thanks for the advice, guys. Been going through hard things myself, but just putting things in perspective, talking to friends, and putting things on a scale of 10 really helps me out. :)

Keep up what you doing! Love you guys!
Most interesting podcast ever!!!!! The wild card effect
After today, I want to learn more about my Filipino heritage and move back to the Philippines. Thank you Ryan for informing me such crucial information at the beginning of this podcast
Ryan and Dereck try to help Paco. But also kinda shit on him.... Kinda not cool.
Paco properly stop making him self look weak all so often. Feel bad for the guy
im late but WHATTTT??? DERRICK BREAKUP WITH ERIKA????
I dare you to do another “I dare you” episode

The dare is “I dare you to hide from the others and if they find you you get a cactus thrown at you”
You should get Joe rogan
 On the podcast
This is one of the only podcasts that I actually consistently watch, keep it up!
WE WANT THE REAL DERRICK! so just post that crazy podcast that you guys talked about in one of the first podcast
I laughed so hard I cried at today's podcast 😆😆😆 

Literally been waiting since Saturday for this and it didn't disappoint!
I'm a 13 y.o and I've watched ALL of your vids and I love them SOOOO much love uuuu
I've been listening to every other podcast, but was home today so I watched the vid instead and its wayyy funnier
I want to hear Derreck Alien's Stories too 🗣
i can't learn couse the freaking high quality of the vid always distracjt me ...
am i the only one who feels happy that derrick likes Marvel so much too? 😂😂
This video made me feel better about expressing my feelings to my friends
WATERMELON WILL IS BACK!

So yeah, Internet Icon 2, anyone?
30mins and 416 comments allready 417 if you count mine
3:50 speaking of audience, I dont really know about other asian countries but here in indonesia, we don't really cheer/shout/clap in the cinema unlike in the us. We would just stay quiet and sometimes we only crack a little laugh.
13:50 omg that’s a perfect explanation for paco, he literally is like the naruto in the beginning of the anime, like the first 20 episodes
First, you wouldn’t upload for a month/ a month and a half, but now you upload so much videos and podcasts, I can’t even keep up with you, haha.
Hey Ryan Can you do a podcast with Phil talking about BgA future plans..😉😆
When you realise; Derick is your fav
tbh it took me a while to start liking Paco too. When he first started appearing in vids i was like ...... whats with this new guy... But hes def grown on me
Bring. Josh. Next.

Roll the likes
Travel Tip: Google maps has an offline mode where you download the map ahead of time to your phone. I used it to get around Costa Rica where I had no service.
you should het theodd1sout on your podcast. And Shayne Topp, Courtney Miller, Keith Leak Jr., Olivia Sui, and Noah Grossman.
Dear Ryan,
Chances of an Agents of Secret Stuff sequel?
Paco is so good at lengthening and directing questions, glad he's part of so many podcasts
I can translate for you guys next time you go to china. I'm fluent in mandarin and worked there for a couple years as well.
What dude!? Derek and Erika broke up? Damn...
I've always heard " We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."
no one:
literally no one:
not a single soul:
Ryan: on the way we're going we're all gonna die
the letters for a ukrainian kiss are correct, but he pronounced it wrong. TSIOM is more correct . LOVE ya bois
Been waiting for this one for so long!!! DERRICK!!!!
Ryan kinda looks like Glen with the scruff.
I’m loving how real these podcasts are (in parts)and getting to know rhpc more knowing that they have all sorts of issues and feelings we can as viewers relate to too. Great work guys :’))
Can’t get broken up with if you don’t have a girlfriend.
Sending love to both Derrick and Mary Erika!
Ryan, you gotta own your patchy beard! it doesn't look bad at all. look at Johnny Depp. the man has never had a full beard in his life, he's basically the king of patchy beards, and yet he's literally one of the biggest male sex symbols ever.
so if you wanna grow your beard, you do it and own it! B)
I really loved the pacing of this one. I looked and I was like I only have 6 minutes left? What?!??!!??!

Derrick I hope everything is ok, and I’m glad y’all are still friends.
37:22 That moment when Ryan predicts Thanos in Endgame
Finally. A theme song. Yes. I am so happy. And Avengers theories. Yes. I... am glad.
Was always wondering where I saw Van Gough's Starry Night first then it hit me; it's always behind Ryan!
Here's some small facts about Macau: 
1. Macau people speak Cantonese, just like Hong Kong's people. And most of us know how to speak English, few of us also speak Portuguese, you can find Portuguese everywhere in Macau 
2. Most of the Macau people is not that rich like crazy rich asian, GDP is just a number games.
3. I assume Derek visits mainly in cotai which is full of tourist, mostly from mainland, most of them are rich, rich, rich and rich. And rude too.
4. Most of us doesn't like mainland Chinese, at least people around me doesn't, because it's just too much of them and it affects us in a bad way, like our daily life, city image, culture. Personally, I never want to see a bunch of tourists, who don't even give a shit about our history or culture, stack in a church or street.
5.And our government is shitty:)
Born and raise in Macau, hearing my favorite youtuber talking about our obscure city is amazing but the fact that they didn't experience well here is just sad.
Hope it guess some attention, cause I really hope people understand that Macau is not a shitty place.
This is the Seinfeld of podcasts. I love it.
It is awesome I wish amercicans could shut the hell up in their boxing matches u can hear every impact
People here in Macau are so addicted to gambling. Some people even poo and pee themselves close to the restroom. On the floor. I saw someone do that myself.
Yo Ryan, you should let fans comment topics for the next podcast, that would be pretty cool!
Again: loved this podcast!! It's a treat to hear you all talking :)
Ryan's pre-beardy lol
I didn't see this one coming, but one of my favorite things about the podcast is... the relationship talk!
I really liked the advice Derek mentioned from someone in China. I think I'm going to start thinking about the stresses in my life like that and see if it helps with my anxiety.
The real saying is that - we'll cross that bridge when we get there- ffs😐
Highlight of my sundays, no my week!
Thanos actually kills people for Lady Death not for mercy, well at least in the comics
Another good episode guys. Helps make my Monday’s at work so much better. 

We’ll cross that bridge when one comes to it. XD
You're the only podcast that I like
I've finally caught up to the pod cast.
Haha “Oh Snap!!!” GET IT?!!! 😂
REALLY AMAZING CONTENT KEEP UP OFF THE PILL
this was definitely one of the best podcasts yet
Try applying Minoxidile on your bald spaces and in like 2-3 months you will have a full beard. Thank me later ;)
Ryan kinda looks like tonystark with his fashionable facial hair
Maybe Paco's research is like Jiraya's😂
Lol Paco says research reminds of jiraya. Rip Jiraya he was a good ninja
i hope youll do another podcast on conspiracies with derrick and paco can like prepare some since hes about that research life
Wait, Infinity War's on Netflix?
Doctor:U have 1 hour and 10 minutes to live

Me: say no more
The reason thanos cant double the universe instead of halfing it is because if you half it the rate of consumption of resources is halved. But if you double the resources you are now doubling the consumption rate as now there is more making more living things able to survive and prosper which only increases the situation. In the end you are just delaying the inevitable, but in thanos' mind halfing fixes it in the best way, a necessary evil to survive
Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.  (Dumbledore)
"We'll cross that bridge when we get there" in the sense that you worry about a problem when you get to it (like an unstable bridge)
"We'll cross the road when we get there" omg, I'm laughing so hard
Derek is like he's rich took me In his porch took me to a fancy restaurant... I was waiting for a "then he took me to his room" 😂😂😂😂😂
Aw man ... I'm sad that Derrick and Erika are broken up ... Derrik, I hope you'll be better soon!
No one:
Me: Endgame releases on my birthday!
Paco turns a podcast into a mukbang xD
You should get kevjumba on the podcast
Day 2 (not in a row) of asking for 
Dear ryan: can you make a duolingo horror movie trailer
No Joke , If This Gets 9 likes I Will Upload the Video Of Me doing the pause challenge with my best friend.😂 I paused him and cut his beard off. He kicked me out his house😂😦😐 (video out now)
Did Ryan leave to turn the A/C on or did he just have to toot outside and make sure the audio didn’t pick it up 😂
Why they always roasting Paco
It's "We'll cross that bridge when we get to it" lol Also I think you can marry your first cousin in Japan, but maybe that changed. I love the deep conversations you guys have, it reminds me of how I talk with my friends xD
I DARE YOU to purposely kick the corner of a wood bed with one of your bare feet
“if you haven’t seen it by the time it’s out of theaters that’s YOUR problem” YES
This allowed us to see Derrick in a different light, and I really appreciate that
Dear Ryan do a cooking but not really staring with you and one of the members of rhpc pls
whenever you guys talk about paco is always funny xD
Ant man into Thanus......lol
PACO's song fire my boys
Paco needs a pop filter (19:42)
I love these podcasts and Ryan's videos overall
It's so nice to see Derrick back! He's such a sweetheart
you probably should have derrick in the podcast often .. that one was soo funny xD
Why can't he keep making awesome videos 😓 leave the podcasts on I heart radio
No one :
every comment on here : No one : Ryan : The age of consent is 12 in Philippines

(think about that)
I don’t want to tell you how to do your job but I think it would be cool if the layout of most of the podcast could be that all three cameras are showing at the same time , so we could see how everyone reacts to certain things etc. Besides that your podcasts are very entertaining and relatable and they really brighten up my day. Thank you! 🙏
im like paco. i associate things i do with someone with that person; whether it be listening to a specific song, watching a tv series, going out to the city.

i had so many “our” songs with my ex, and whenever i hear it now, i associate it wt her.
watching an episode of a tv series that she put me on, makes me think of her.
going to a specific spot in the city, makes me just remember what me and her did at that spot.
leanord and church plug xd
I love Derrick. I relate to him a lot. I’m usually the guardian of my groups, and just the way he Carries himself is amazing. I would love an autograph from him more than anyone else in their group. Let alone his talent and humbleness. Just love this man.
I love all of Ryan's video even the podcasts
Dere-leeky-holes 😂🔥


Paco is always in a good mood though 🔥
Ryan doesn’t need that cup = SPONSORED BY RED BULL
Hong Kong welcomes you Paco! Hope you enjoy your trip here <3
Re: Billionaire Talk
I'd want to be a billionaire but like I'm the only one who knows about it (so like having multiple investments that went really well so like the companies I invested in are 1. complete strangers 2. they only know a part of my overall wealth) except like the bank and the government because... taxes
Then I'd just live like any normal person (have the same lifestyle as I do now) and not just splurge my cash on stuff like luxary cars so nobody knows I'm rich
then from time to time I'd give out gifts to friends and relatives and make anonymous donations to charity and stuff so people still benefit from my secret wealth without really knowing it exists idk something like that
Would it still be tempting to splurge all that cash? yeah, but if I continue to live the way I do now, then I'd probably forget I have all that wealth most of the time
Who knew Derrick was such a nerd😂
love from China. You guys are awesome.
GFuel sponsorship. Bet
Are you guys sponsored my Hyperx or something?
I've always been a fan of Derrick's! It's really nice to see him open up and get personal like this :)
Me: Let's sleep now.

Nigahiga: uploads a video
Please something other than podcasts!
i think people in macau mostly speak cantonese though, if i remember correctly
Derek is hot? Nah Paco is way cuter.
The Stones only work in our Universe and it is unable to work outside of its universe. So creating another Universe is not possible
58:20 the watch is Tissot, pronounced Tissoe
We will burn the bridge when we get there! Jk, cross the bridge when we get there :) and this was really fun podcast, loved learning more about Derek
56:13 i love Derrick's laugh <3
No one : 
Thanos : i will wipe you out if you give endgame spoilers
Dear Ryan
Call MKBHD in video
either Ryan copied Arden (shirt) or vice versa, which is it guys haha, love it.
respect paco for even having the guts to say he lost his v card at 26 but like he didn’t got to do that
Remember when he was the most subbed in like 2011
Shout outs for me
the event is is the energy drink that was mentioned backwards in his exposed rap
Ryan talk about Andre Yang
glad to see derrick back in videos 😊
Ryan always come through with these podcast. I always listen to these podcast as I write my papers, and it helps. Try it kids
Does anyone actually watch these?

(I mean I love ray but yeah...)
Derrick = guard dog (i totally see this)
Actually, while we're on the topic of "Rude Chinese Tourists", they are frowned upon in mainland China as well.
A large portion of the population considers them international embarrassments and shame them online. The issue is however, for the vast majority of these people they are severely under-educated and "uncultured", reason being that they managed to get rich through various "questionable" methods e.g. through the selling of ancestral land.
Their growth in wealth is disproportionate to their growth as a person, however it doesnt stop them from travelling abroad. What effectively happens is that they bring whatever uncouth habits they had while they were poor financially with them, as they were never taught any better.

Even within mainland itself the uneducated yet rich are always shunned- I dont know if it's fair to classify it as it being a part of the Chinese culture as it seems to more be a byproduct of a country becoming financially wealthy, it culturally poor.
omg paco better visit lan kwai fong when he goes to hk!!!
I’m way too similar to dereck 






I LOVE IT
Will cross the bridge when one comes to it. 😁😁
In Hong Kong,  movie theaters are very quiet,
Derrick and erika broke up...😕oh well along as they're happy
I was dying when Derrick was like that was wind and blew in the mic 😂
OMG Paco's wearing the watermelon shirt from internet icon!!
I am going to go on a 49-day water fast for Ryan's ADHD. Starting now.
I like how everyone in the podcast are truthful to each other.
It would be so cool if the members of RHPC take a personality test. Can this be a Dear Ryan? Hmm...
I get distracted by the bobble heads behind Ryan sometimes
I'm Christian and I had also thought of us humans being a fruit of incest because we do come from Adam & Eve who were chosen to be in paradise but were kicked out because they beared children together.
But the story is that Adam & Eve were not the only ones that existed at that time, there were others separate from them but a lot of people don't know about it and believe that we all come from Adam & Eve.
Cotai is an area in Macau (which is a city) which is an autonomous region in China. 

i think they got that backward.
Yo love Derrick, he should be on more often
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
My favorit podcast so far!! Love how the discussion run smoothly with perfect transition from one topic to another.
And, Pacoruto, you're not weird. Just surrounded by different type of person. There are many expressive people like you here in Asia. I can even relate to your jokes and personality.
Dear Ryan, can you make an Apex Legends movie trailer?
Yessss paco is backk🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯🙌
I love Ryan. Hopeful that theres instn team ten or Channel awesome allegation around the corner
Hair doesn't grow back thicker, it just looks like it cause the ends has a blunt cut. That's what I've heard at least 👀
That moment when you were about to go to Philippines for your 12th bday:(
dear ryan can you make the ultimate box fort
Can you start making videos like you used to do like about a year ago those were amazing
Hey Remember those days nigahiga was no1 youtuber? Now he's only 21 mill
Ha the quality (was poor because of my internet connection) of the video became better right when Ryan clapped the last clap!
Ryan 😍
Derek 😍
Paco 😍
Ryan 😍
Derek 😍
Paco 😍
Nobody:
The first couple seconds of the video:the consent age in Philippines is 12
Ryan 😍
Derek 😍
Paco 😍
Ryan growing out that goateeeeeeeee
HI PACOCOCO
I missed Paco dude!
please bring dtrix on this!!!
Its so cool how far you have evolved! Remember how to be a ninja?
I identify with Paco as my spirit animal
Paco's back.... :-D
One word GALACTUS
Dear Ryan, can you do a old big three (one piece, Naruto, bleach) vs the new big three (boruto, my hero academia, and black cover)
KEEP THE BEARD RYAN!!!!!! Dx it doesn't matter if it's "patchy" or "not perfect"! it's like what Derrick said, it's cool because it's unique to YOU! ;)
Cantonese is spoken in Canton also known as a part of GuangZhou and the version in HongKong is a different version of it. JUST FYI8
Im actually waiting for ryan to make a discord server
i guess we'll cross the bridge when one comes to it. (Like if you stayed til the end)
highlight of my week is this podcast
As much as I love podcasts, I dare say us fans would love to see skits again
Well, Thanos can't create anything from nothing.

Even if he could, 
it would be very hard to produce resources for the whole universe and would consume too much power.

It is easier to disintegrate something to nothing.
Ryan : At this rate all of us will die
Wut
"we'll cross that bridge when we get to it".
Slurping in the Japanese culture is just how we eat, nothing to do with politeness or anything like that. If someone is slurping ramen there it's more like the proper way of eating it.
This podcast has turned into a half-roast, half-complement Paco session.
I think the saying is "We'll cross that bridge when we get there"
I loved this podcast... I really like you three different kinds of introverts talk for more than an hour 😇 and i really like Derrick
It's the same in Korea with the 2 hands thing, it shows respect and care
100th dislike (sorru ryan i had to)
I didn’t like Paco that much before but since the podcast he’s pretty much my fav
This video came in the perfect time when I’m going through a break up. I just started watching this so hopefully there is some good advice.
In Japan, not only you have to accept business card with both hands, when you exchange your business card with elders or higher rank person, make sure your business card is below their  business card. Accept their first then pass yours after.
I've stayed in China for 2 months, I can confirm what Derrick said is sooooo true, personal space is non-existent. The culture is sooooo weird...
No twitter q and a no special words at the end but still had blast watching it love the podcast
Yo my personality is pretty similar to Derricks I didnt realize lol
[INSERT_SECRET_WORD_HERE]
hello from Vietnam . could you please make a video about VN. thanks
game of thrones and marvel in kne vid discussed by one of my most favorite youtubers. is today the best dya ever ir what?
I just watched infinity war today XD
My movie theater experience in China was different, it was just like how it is here in America. It could be a regional thing or how much they care about what’s being casted. The unenthusiastic audience though, I’ve seen a lot. They just don’t get hyped up. I was class valedictorian a few years back and when they announced that, my family just clapped, while other people got loud cheers and screams.
me: starts packing
If yall watch this whole thing yall crazy
I just tried snapping with my fist closed.
Im into the facial hair Ryan👍👍
These guys just get more and more relatable every podcast
Just one thing 




Paco’s shirt is great
Derek as a marvelor is me as an army in my friends group😂🤓
It's sad how his experience and review on Macau (Special Administrative Region of China, with its own government like Hong Kong and is treated as a separate jurisdiction; Cantonese is also used, just like HK) as a professional entertainer were almost negative, but yeah, grew up in Macau and had those same problems Derrick had... controversial but it might have to do with the recent influx of mainlanders? Anyhooooow, loved this and I look forward to even more of this!
Hey can you do a version of old time road??
On The topic of the Notre Dame Cathedral, I don't think the argument of it being in the news so much is why it is being supported. I think it's partly because it is a historical building, partly that it affects more people, and partly because it's astronomically easier and cheaper to fix. Because think about the hunger problem. Yes hundreds of millions of dollars is a lot, but that's nothing compared to having to feed millions, for years. The Cathedral is a one time payment. once you fix it that's it. But to feed all the hungry you have to feed them for life. Besides The cathedral is easily done and striaght forward. but how do you ensure you sent food to every tiny village from, Nepal to Egypt to South Africa. It's impossible.
Ive heard they're gonna put Squirrel Girl in Marvels phase four lol
Derrick is so tranquil, I’ve never heard him talk for this long
AVENGERS THEORIES??! Lets go!!!!
theres so much passive aggressiveness with rhpc and paco.. i feel kind of bad
Dear Ryan: I'm in year 8. Save me.
this could be easily confused for drugs holding.
You should get Jmocak and Green on here
snapping half of life from existence is a bad thing?
This was actually therapeutic to me as well. 
Thanks guys
Dear Ryan,
I know that this would probably really really hard to do, but do you think you could make another BgA song?
You should get Matthias on the podcast!!! Like so he sees
I've experienced first hand Chinese tourists in Japan 😧 the contrast in culture and behaviour is very clear..
@ the drinking age thing 

as a teenager my parents let me drink in the house (not to excess) so i wouldn't go crazy with it when i was an adult
Slurping ramen is not a compliment to the chef, it’s just something you do to eat it even when it’s hot.
i hope paco's ok, that first part was rough...
David's a
-cannibal
-canonball
-can of balls
I bought tickets to endgame like a week or so before it comes out so I can watch it the day it comes out so I don't get barraged by spoilers
Awww they didn't ask Derrick about his alien story.
Paco, please do your radio voice again.
Ryan can you stack 10 Dice with cup
Going through the same as Derrick now after my long term relationship.
Us Muslims we believe in Adam and Eve too
How dare u make a joke about my religion dude 😑
Jking 😂😂
Thinking about it tho we're all product of incest.. I guess it was a one time thing tho
Can you continue skitzo 😞😞😞
Im gonna watch this whole thing just to see how they came from breakups to avenger theories
First 
I disliked the video before I started it
Hey buddy ummm HOW BOUT  U POST A SKIT
Just grow out the beard. It will look good
I am a lawyer in the Philippines, our laws ordain that a person cannot legally enter into a contract until he/she is 18 which includes marriage (except for sale of purely personal belongings). Thus, having sexual relations with a minor (17 or less) may subject you certain criminal (qualified seduction/violation of child abuse act RA 7610/rape for 12 years old or less) as well as civil liabilities. I guess Ryan is talking about the age of criminal responsibility which is  15  depending on whether or not acted with discernment.
Myth: rub tomatoes and alot will grow
I thought it was "We'll cross that bridge when we get there." Hmmm...
Hey Ryan can you plz do another parkcourse
What do Scarlet Witch and a blind man have in common?
Can you make Nice Guys again with the  same People
hey man, soz about china. its sad and its real. i dont do that kinda stuff.
My parents always make me accept and give things with two hands
Bring Will back but keep derrick and paco then talk about more consipracy theories, i think that episode will be interesting :) :)
I just realised I didn’t know Derek that much before this podcast.
People say they are roasting Paco.. but we don't know Paco like they do.. they are closer to him.. There maybe a reason they are saying these..
I think Ryan actually hates Paco and just doesn't want to admit it
Today's fact: As of 2016, the site MySpace still gets 50 million visitors a month!
Now i really wanna know where i can get that shirt that Ryan is wearing ;-;
I don’t have time to watch every single video but I just happened to watch all 14 podcasts and enjoy every single second of them. But I missed many videos especially recent ones, I haven watched them yet, because I have no time.
So I went to see Avengers last years in english back home and here I am seeing everyone commenting and being all exited, whereas I'm sitting here and having a culture shock LOL
Ryan can you bring back the conspiracy theory videos





Like so Ryan can see this
do more ryan tries
Yo was Derek high😂😂
Derrick's awesome! He loves marvel ! Ryan and paco you guys gotta watch that shit... and GAME OF THRONES
Can you plz talk about anime
Meet me in Hong Kong bro
Mos hardworking youtuber ever, keep going higa
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it"
Woa... I have started to find podcasts so engaging. Earlier, it did seem a lot of hours! Now, it's like can watch in subway or car.. !
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it"
What a way to start a podcast
y'all should do a live otp
Paco is rude sksksk lol

ALSO NOOO DERRICK sending you all the love and hugs I’m sorry you have to go through that : (
I think I just started crying when Derrick blew into the mic hahahaa
Hey why don't you do a roblox fake movie trailer
He should really get Snapchat
Im Ukrainian and its not “too som” its one syllable “tsom.”
population is exponential if thanos doubled the resources the it would be consumed at an exponential rate and wouldnt last as long if he took off half the consumption.
lol I bought 2 tickets for 2 days for Avengers too
When I'm late: I wish I was early I
When I'm early: so what the hell should I say
First
heck u paco
Lol at Ryan and paco getting green HP gauges in the beginning but Derek only getting blue MP. What a loser
Pls can you get kevjumba
No one:
Derrick: Marvel!
Can we get Logic on the podcast?
I love these podcasts !
I feel I'm addicted to these podcasts.
yeaaaaaaaaaaaah Derrick. I like DERRICK
Early squad here

↓click this if you're early
Can you please other kind of videos
I hate off the pill videos
Where my word of the video at?
Shout out to (MA) Massachusetts people THE AGE OF CONSENT HERE IS 16 !
That off the pill mug needs to become available.
Derrick seems so sweet tho. It was nice to hear more of him.

Thanks YouTube
Go watch Death Battle, they just broke down some of the big points in Thanos’s story in last seasons finale.
u grew beard. :o






prebeardyyyyy
I am a big fan of Ryan and I pretty much think I know a lot about him so I tend to skip his podcasts. I watched this and now I have 12 more podcasts to cram. Also, I wonder how the ninja melk taste like?
It’s sad to watch the live sub counter because it’s like barley moving
PACOS WATERMELON T SHIRT internet icon anyone?
Dear Ryan can you react to Nigerian parodies (bad edits)
The saying is 'We'll cross that bridge when we get to it'😏
Derrick somewhere in japan: Dattebayo
Just realized this was an hour
I literally listened to this when doing the dishes instead of music xD it was fun
Who liked nigahiga's videos like 3 years ago
Eeeeey my man  RYAN FINALLY GOT THAT MUSTACHE
I have an internal tomorrow and just started studying when i got the notification. Well guess who is gonna fail tomorrow 😂.
i love ur smiles :3
I love Paco's watermelon shirt!
Thanos from the cinema version is a mercy compared to comic book. In the comics it was 10x worse
Oh my god that's why Erica has not been in the videos.
The beginning i heard "philippines" i was like
Me: 0o0
I think it's great that they can talk to each other and feel supported by their friends even if they're (Derrick/Ryan) the type not to bring their problems up. I have a lot of friends who don't talk about their problems and I always have trouble getting them to vent and helping them feel better, so it's wonderful that they appreciate the bonds they have with each other that allow them to help each other like that.
higa is the first most subbed youtuber on 2011
For your next dear Ryan can you do a short skitzo
Ryan lookin a lil thicco mode
Who else clicked sooo fast ❤❤




Btw can a brothaa get a new subbb.....
I'm the same as Derrick with the Marvel stuff
Jimmy O. Yang jokes about black people in one of his stand-up shows. Quite funny! :P
I didn't even make it 'till lunch on Friday before getting spoiled for Endgame...
I think the facial hair looks good
I'm early wth should I say
paco made ryan's ear wax wiggle 58:59
This was dammmn ps- Ryan's mustache is ❤️❤️❤️❤️
sometimes idk who to believe between Ryan and Paco hahaha
Ryan's going through prebeardy again
Dear Ryan,can you make a song about mobile legends
Rayan looks so good with that moustache👌👌👌👌
I especially like the podcasts where ryan and friends just do therapy or theorys because its relatable and fun
I agree about where you said Chinese people can be considered rude (I'm Chinese btw 😂). Literally if you go to Hong Kong (which is usually really busy cus there are a lot of street markets and stuff) and you're walking on the streets but accidently bump into someone, they won't even say sorry or anything, or they will start picking fights with you. But verbally... like they will full on swear at you, cursing out your whole lineage and wish you die in hell and stuff. Old chinese women are probably the scariest, they will talk about how your mother didnt teach you right or question if you had any manners and shit WHILE SHOUTING SO THE WHOLE CROWD CAN HEAR. But I guess you can say that it isn't just Chinese people that do that lol 😂😂 I was talking to my mum about this the other day lmao
36:40 Avengers theories
Damn, Ryan can actually grow decent facial hair for an asian.
3:27 reminded me of the vine of that girl talking to Marlene “oh mY GOD why can’t yoU just take the compliMENTTTTTTT”
20:00 Paco is such a real dude and he's so good at focusing on good points
Dear Ryan,
Can you try dice stacking on Ryan tries.
hi Ryan see you tv Disney know all time
"Well cross that bridge when we come to it"...dear.
Dear Ryan. Make a video about crossing the bridge when you get there.
Nice to see Ryan in a different shirt
Because this is killing me: the saying is “we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.” 
Love the podcast and I look forward to it every week!
Ryan “the age of consent in the Philippines is 12” Higa
Dear Ryan, do Boomerang Trickshots
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Seeing Derrick this serious is pretty nice
Best job in the world? Being Ryan’s friend.

-Josh Otusanya
in the philippines, even our aunt and uncles let us drink at 12. at 17, i can go to a bar without an id as long as you pass a someone more mature.
I’ve always heard “ we will cross that bridge once we get to it”
I’m definitely a Paco in a friend group lol.  Confrontation is the best way to solving a problem!
Post more skitzo videos plzz
Red pill and blue wow what a hint. Both iron man and cap die, are you sure you guys didn’t direct the movie?
Ryan has been shirtless in lots of BTS and I never once saw chesthair (I wish I could say I didn't look that close, but I mean, it's shirtless Ryan, so...)
dear ryan
        can you make an fruit ninja 2.0

Dear Ryan,
Can you do another kpop parody?
Put your 3 favourite dear Ryan’s in order in the reply’s
I'm so much like Derrick, love to know someone like me
What is ninia helk? It's behind Derrek
Dear Ryan,
Can you make a Youtubers: Endgame fake trailer with some OG youtubers
Dear Ryan do an Avengers Infinity Was Parity
Actually Adam and Eve aren't siblings..Eve was made of Adam's rib... so it's like some weird clone insest thing😂😂
ryan looks more asian with facial hair its interesting lol
Unless if u want hardcore Marvel fans to attack u, don’t call Avengers: Endgame a less serious topic.
I gotta say, I really respect Paco for being able to express his feelings. We need people like Paco, to be role models for guys who might not be able to fully express themselves. It takes a lot to open yourself up to others, thank you for being yourself Paco.
how does ryan stay out of controversies?
This is a hostile off the pill
Love these podcasts so much...
Please do how to be Emo 2.0
One thing that always annoys me about american talkshows is how much energy the crowd has. Like i dont need the crowd to yell and clap after each sentence. It really ruins the show for me
Am i the only one noticing the dope shirt of Ryan
Derek is so me wow.
Slurping is not inpolite but it isn't a compliment to the chef. That's fake news :))
DearRyan please bring back cooking but not really
Would it be an Off The Pill podcast without attacking Paco? HAHA
"Were cross that bridge when we get to it"
not being rude Ryan but with that "beard", you look like the person mommy asks me to stay away from
Wow Derrick is finally here - and Ryan has to have his moustache hmm.
Is erika still in rhpc?
mustache, watermelon man, and derrick.
Everyone can make fun of everyone.  There are no qualifiers. When you start putting qualifiers on it then you start making an ever revolving subjective level of offence.  Just don't be hateful or racist and it'll be fine.  And I don't mean the new subjective definition of racism that includes power / privilege.
Basically, Paco busts Ryan out a lot lol
YOU INSPIRED ME TO START A CHANNEL OF MY OWN!!! THANKS RYAN!
okay, paco is really a wild card.. sometimes he says the worst things and other times I actually crack up... reminds me of me.... i think i am this friend of the group.... well frick
damn I relate with Paco waaaaay too much
Who's gonna watch Endgame?
DO MORE SKETCH
Yay my favorite guest, Derrick!!
i think the snap is just suppose to be the ultimate ability of the gauntlet that we just have to accept, while the fact that he has to close his fist to use the individual stones is a nice little thing the screen writer throw in during the battle on Titan that makes that scene a lot more cohesive and easy to understand, pleasant to watch, cause it gives the heroes a clear secondary goal to achieve (the main goal being subduing Thanos to take his gauntlet out), while establishing that Thanos IS the strongest being in the universe therefor they need a way to nerf him to have a chance to win.
Derrick!! Things will get better!!! Sending support!!
do sing like your favourite singer pt 3
hmm why is there no more dear ryans i dont really listen to podcasts
Were in the Endgame now 
- Dr Strange
Im definitly the paco of the group
I saw a new side of Derrik this time like he always seems like a joker and just so random and I dont know very differently during videos but after this video I really see him differently
can you make a non podcast pls
yooooo more power to you derrick I've been noticing that and I speculated that you were going through a breakup I didn't want to come to conclusions but yeah. your true fans knew this bruh at least I did
Hey Ryan, can I have a heart, please? Love you!
yeah, im still waiting for arden to roast ryan in the comment saying it was really her shirt.
JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU :) HE SHALL COME BACK! :)
why do you only makes these "off the pill" things now, i miss old nigahiga
Totally agree on thanos comment
Love your beard, Ryan
Watermelon Will is back boys!
why all this time i never knew derrick was a quite person? and i've been watching for at least for 6 years and watch all the vids including all the vids from higatv. and i never knew. how did i missed that? like how???
I love Derricks confusing trolls it’s so funny
Thanos doesn't make more food because everything he changes with the reality stone goes back after a while.
Nice youtube
Watched:206
Like:306

Well done youtube well done...
"we get there when we get there!"
It really feels like both of them hate paco
Every time Paco talks I like him less and less
Thanos killed half the universe for Lady Death in the comics at least, in the movie I believe he did it because of a tragedy that happened on his hime planet
You upload too fast Ryan, I can’t keep up!!!!😆🙌🏼
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
It’s we’ll burn/cross that bridge when we get to it. Incase it’s still tickling your brain
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
To the people asking why Ryan hasn't made a avengers parodyjust know he is alwayslate to the trend
Yes I'm finally early this time
Poor Paco, getting salty haha
Who else came here to hear them talk about Avengers: Endgame
39:12 i feel exactly the same about what paco says
someone should tell ryan that the sound of a snap comes from your middle finger hitting the palm of your hand
Thanks for the amazing post on my birthday!! Happy Easter as well!!!
Has anyone realized the breakup if Derrick is Erika?
I always thought the saying was ‘we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it’
Ryan : The age of consent is 12 in Philippines

Good to have Derrick back!
..... still can remember the day when you had millions of viewers.... damn...
i just wanna say to what ryan is talking about at 30:12 m night shyamalan. his movies are extremely outside of the box, love him or hate him, ya gotta admit, his work is completely original. I really respect his level of effort.
Ye btw captain america weilds mjolinr
Not even kidding
Yikes this got real, poor Paco 😬
Wait derrick is in jabawockeez
Ryan is not doing as well in youtube as he use to

Thanos is in love with death thats why he is doing it 🤔
Happy Easter!🐣
It’s just sad that people come to Macau now feels negative☹️☹️☹️ since we’re not always be seen on media.
If you don’t make a pop sound with the intro are you even in fan?
Pacos shirt💗💗💗💗
Word of the day: bridge
28.14% will read this
Dear Ryan: Why did you choose the name nigahiga for your channel?
I didnt know they broke up??
The age of consent in saudia Arabia is 0 isnt it?
Ryan has got a moustache
i have a feeling that the surprise has something to do with red bulll...
Since when did Ryan grow a beard
Stop bullying Paco bro... Paco probably cries himself to sleep.
i'm honestly kind of ashamed being a filipino. and the age of consent is one of those things. but i know my country will be better as time goes (sorry if i offended anyone, i just wanted to be honest for once lol)
Dear ryan can you make a superhero episode with the RSHPC?
Erika doesn't deserve you, Derrick. You'll find better
i live in the Philippines and yet the 'age of consent' is a goddamn news to me wtf
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it...
Paco, like that shirt. Where'd u get it from?
Derrick is so sweet
I'm the first to dislike😭, at least I'm the first😂😐
I want paco's shirt
i feel like this is roasting paco in a nice way for an 1:10:47 long
You cross the bridge when you come to it. :)
I feel like everyone rips on paco and then if he says anything they get upset
Who else keep refreshing around 1:59? 😂
dear ryan can you do a game of thrones theemed vid??????
When Paco was talking about getting naked it reminded me of gibby taking his shirt off
Around 1:05:00

I’m not sure about all European countries, but German alcohol is very diluted. That’s why their drinking age is 16, and American alcohol is illegal for anyone under the age of 21. Another thing is, they are educated much more about it. It’s the same reason why a lot of European countries have younger ages of consent (14-16) because they use comprehensive sex Ed while the US tends to use abstinence sex Ed. Since they’re more educated on this kind of stuff, they’re less likely to drink and drive or get pregnant at a young age.
Make another brain games
Dear Ryan, Can you do an Avengers: Endgame trailer parody?
I feel for paco, he has so much love to give and just hasn’t found the right person who is willing to accept it and reciprocate. Don’t settle my man, you’ll find someone eventually. I’m 26 and on the same boat. Dating and just not finding the right one who will be silly and joke around with me. It’ll come. It’ll come.
Spoiler ahead 





Black widow is a gril like if u saw
I think Captain America might die. I 98.9% sure Black Widow and Iron Man will die.
Wow..18:39 a coincidence. I decided today for the first time listen to this podcast..and I’m going through the same thing as Dereck. Thank you ❤️ I needed that
Ryan Hairy Chin 👉👍
Dear Ryan, can you make a Duolingo Owl horror trailer
I want to share that I currently live in China, and the first time I went to the cinema I was shocked, people had their phone brightness all the way up, talking .... haha but I accepted it as a part of their culture. I am annoyed every time I go watch a movie tho ....
who else love ryan old videos and hate the podcast but still love him lol😹
What if the thing you’re trying to avoid by getting high is chronic anxiety? I have chronic and severe generalized anxiety disorder, something I was born with as I was showing signs at literally hours old. While I do take prescription medicine to basically keep me from being a wreck 24/7, I still get frequent panic attacks. Rather than take Xanax which would just put me to sleep, I smoke weed. It actually allows me to relax and lessens that Panicked feeling. So I smoke to avoid panic attacks and anxiety.
Paco chose to be with you guys so you really shouldn’t be roasting him.
all the love to derrick❤️
Listening them attempting to understand Thanos’ philosophy was entertaining
Did anyone else feel satisfied when Derick was taking and just him?
It’s crazy how I understand Derek’s psychology in life.
Uh ho, truth comes out!
Derrick is so precious
Paco is a delicious watermelon 🍉 in this video. Love the shirt. ❤️
I need the tee that Rayan is Wearing
Thanos creates Earth ... 2
Does Paco stream games
Dear Ryan please make wrap song of your welcome from mowona
The special code this week is "we'll cross that bridge when we cross that bridge"
Johnny deppcokmmet secret millionaire
Pacos moan eating his noodles was gold
Why do they always judge Paco
Can you do a parkour video
Have Jenna Marbles on the podcast
I am a dude and several years ago I used to have a buzz cut. I decided to grow it really long (it's now down to my nipples) and it doesn't look bad now but there were definitely lengths of hair that looked weird. Lots of classmates at school told me to go back to a buzz cut but I said screw that and kept growing it longer even though it looked bad or weird at the time. Over time people who knew me just started to accept it and people who have never seen me before just thought it looked fine.
Derrick is great
Derricks a Capricorn isn’t he ... I know when I see a fellow cappy
Dear Ryan








is Sean a Girl?
Dear Ryan 
Bring dear Ryan back
Who hasn't seen game of thrones ?
lol the week i got dumped this came out, i was like "sweet!"
Infinity Wars spoiler alert (?)
Didn't Thanos just not create new resources because he said humans won't learn anything if you just hand everything to them?
how have i not seen any of these
29:28 I was just saying that to my roommate, citing that M Knight Shyamalan- say what you will about his movies, but they are original stories
Ryan is Thanos, confirmed 33:27
Dear Ryan please do a gaming podcast
I want to know your location!
Dear Ryan can you watch boku no pico
last week i commented and got a lot of likes and a reply saying i'm funny




wonder what i'll get this week 
:)
i've learned so much random new stuff and different interesting information thanks to this podcast and the things you guys bring up and talk about. and you ALWAYS make the discussions captivating and entertaining. i love that so much. this podcast is definitely one of, if not the best thing you've ever come out with. 
also, i see ppl in the comment section feel bad about Ryan kinda 'calling out' or 'roasting' Paco often, but you gotta understand that's just their dynamic and the charm in their relationship. Paco obviously doesn't hold back with roasting him right back. besides, you can tell that everyone in the RHPC really likes and appreciates Paco, in all his peculiar, zany, wild card glory. :')
he's really refreshingly different and very raw and genuine in being himself. in a world where everyone is preoccupied with how others perceive them and then modify their behavior to fit in with others and put up appearances, it's good to see there are also ppl like Paco who are uninhibited and will always be 100% their honest selves no matter how weird others may find them. :)
Asians can do black jokes. They just do like a point of view from both races.
17:48 Can I say that Paco has a sweet and serious side it shows in this moment.
I had a Great time
ryan giggling at his friends is so cute
Dear Ryan can you make up more lyrics to "every rose has its thorn"?
When y’all mentioned the fact that Paco gets naked for no reason I thought of Gray from Fairytale
lowkey I relate to paco
Grow the beard! Do it!
Who's off the pill here? Ryan or Paco? Because... Paco changes subject or opinion so faaast lol
Cross that bridge wen one gets there

Hey nigahiga I love your videos.

Now I’m Australian and I must say vegemite is disgusting by itself.
But just for me and all the Australians who watch you can you please try a vegemite sandwich you spread the vegemite like you do with peanut butter and try it.
I promise you will love it.
(Love your videos)

who did he brake up with
24:00
Paco's voice is hella cool
Stay the way you are pako
41:30 it's okay Ryan. That's what is implied in the Bible. and that is not wrong at that time because they have no choice, the rules are given progressively, so no incest rule is only established after people have spread across the world
adam and eve wernt the first people.  they were the first to realize god.
Scientists has found the DNA of a woman that they can retrace everyone to. So technically and scientifically are everyone related. So hi relatives!
"We'll cross that bridge when we get there" Idk wtf google saying
Why is Paco's camera so bright?
Ryan looks like he has Sean's goatee
We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it lmao

@paco First
Dear Ryan can you do a realistic trailer of Naruto
no the rule is dont talk about it until after the dvd/digital release.   including naruto.  poor people outnumber you rich turds...rich is earning more than 60k a year.  cause most people make less than that.  but really rich is relative and middle class pretty much doesnt exist anymore and most people make around 30k.  60k used to be middle class but no one makes that anymore so thats rich.
That's a long video
cross the bridge when you get there!!!
I love how Ryan has a 1 hour video and only has 3 ads.
Imagine the Avengers all dying
Cantonese is in the Guangzhou area as well so mainland Chinese people also speak it depending where they come from!
Dear Ryan can you make a huge contraption just to put water in a cup
Lol good points 😂
Dear Ryan what handed are you and write a paragraph with your other hand which u don't use 2 times
Just to be clear, 12 is not the age of consent in the Philippines. It is for criminal liability, so if you want to smash some 12 years old there, don't.
wOW Paco, you can't stream people massaging you with their bodies??? That's ridiculous!! Stupid rules
I like Ryans stubble
You guys should talk about more upcoming movies, not to many but once and a while. Btw you should also talk about the new joker movie.
2 out of 13 off the pill podcasts got 1+ milion views. These are by far the least viewed videos
Dear Ryan, can you turn into super saiyan?
Just to be clear, 12 is not the age of consent in the Philippines. It is for criminal liability, so if you want to smash some 12 years old there, don't unless you want to get mobbed. Please dont spread false information Ryan.
Anyone else screaming “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there” the entire podcast
Shoutout to watermelon will if u know u know
do a " all the ways to get toothpaste out of the bottle" its for a dear Ryan
any non-democratic country is a 3rd world country. plain and simple. its amazing how many rich people choose to live in 3rd world countries or support 3rd world country governments.
western thing just not suitable for chinese
When u realize ur fav person left? Goodbye sean
dear ryan can you break your pc

Ryan : "The Age of Consent in Philippines is 12 years old. " POTANG*NA my mom didn't tell me that
You can't double the land because than we would just have more children and overpopulate again
This use to be #1 in 2011 on YT
Dear Ryan,can you make another EPS of Brane Games
شلون وصلت هاذا العدد الهائل من الأشتراكات واااااااااااااااااااو اصلا قناة جميلة و جيدة و حلو و لطيفة و هاهية
I LOVE MARVEL SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH AND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING ALL THE MOVIES TO PREPARE.
Derricks teeth is sparkling damn
Just to be clear, 12 is not the age of consent in the Philippines. It is for criminal liability, so if you want to smash some 12 years old there, don't. Unless you want to get mobbed. Please dont spread false information Ryan.
Talking during a movie is also considered rude in China. Our people are just bad-mannered.
This guy used to be the most subed
Technically, everyone does have incest within their "bloodline" and it's actually more common than people may think. There are many 2nd cousin pairings that people don't even realize. Not to mention, we can calculate the most recent common ancestor for all humans. This is all purely scientific and there are a plethora of studies that can explain it.
dear ryan, can you make a video having paco  as your partner
The problem with the notion that world hunger is a problem is because we have a food shortage problem is wrong. The reason we have world hunger is we have a food sharing problem, the world has more than enough food to feed everyone but first world countries waste/throw away a lot of food that could feed people coupled with the fact that in first world countries such as the United States most people consume a large surplus of calories it shows that there is food for everyone just not enough for everyone to eat as much as they want and live as they do now is first world countries.
Who is Derrick breaking up with?
Dear Ryan , can you do food trickshots
Yay Ryan
Is it just me or is Ryan like the most judgmental and kinda meanish of the 3 in a way. Like if anyone says anything he just has a way to put them down in such a shady way. Love yah btw Ryan, not tryna troll or anything.
I always think the name plates at 0:42 are health bars
1:07:44 exclusive footage of paco scratching his butt
Dear Ryan, can you make a Game Of Thrones rap?
99 people are on the chopping block
No comments on naked Paco okay...
Dear Ryan, can you have a bboy battle against Derrick?
i feel bad for paco lol
Nah, most Chinese people think those people are rude, too.
37:31 even if he did double the food the same thing would happen where we would run out of resources and the population would get bigger and bigger
Hey u got monetized!
Ryan has facial hair
Yay Paco's back!!!
ryan if you go ph pls eat mang inasal heheheh ty
Derrick is just sweet
YAY DERRICKS BACK
39:21
well cross that bridge when we cross the bridge
philippines, my home country is a lil messed up ik
I can live my life, die of natural causes, then the population could severely go down I guess, I just don't feel like getting snapped or killed for the only reason being "population is too big"
Una leyenda, que fue el top 1 y ahora todos lo abandonaron
Honestly, can u guys stop making fun of paco?
Am I the only one who thinks 'Off the Pill' sounds like a name for a campaign encouraging people to reproduce more????
Lightning McQueen dies in Endgame
Dear Ryan can you do a realtime trick shots
So just scrolled down to see someone spoiling endgame, to that guy and all those people spoiling it lemme say this, please shut up and respect other people who haven't seen it, it ain't cool
Nf therapy session
I didn’t realize paco was a watermelon
I understand wanting a movie series to end because they’re milking it, but Marvel isn’t necessarily milking their movies. They started this series with this plan for it to last over 10 years and every movie was planned out before hand, so even if the movies didn’t do as good as they did, Marvel would have released more either way. It was the plan all along and they just stuck with it, no milking involved!
Is it only for me or the video itself is kinda laggy
Grow the beard. Grow the beard. Grow the beard!!!!
Dear Ryan can you make a movie trailer about pacos life
every friend group has a paco
Paco you're so soft
remember the time he was once the most subscriber person on YouTube
Hey Ryan will u eat a raw onion while smelling an onion?
is derek an aries low key on the inside ???
High key I feel like Paco is the most open, nice person with nice intentions. He seems like someone who would be able to express himself without holding back because he doesn’t care about what others think.
Dear ryan  can you make a new naruto video
Only the OGs know when Paco wore that shirt when he was in Internet Icon
this video came out 21 minutes ago, it’s over an hour long and people are commenting like they’ve seen the whole thing. haha
guys, HONG KONG IS DIFFERENT FROM CHINA>< ALL THOSE MENTIONED CULTURES IN CHINA DOES NOT APPEAR IN HONG KONG, even if they do it's because of those freaking rude Chinese mainlanders.
I think its about that drink , as he said in the song
me a chinoy: I'm 18 and i didn't know that the age of consent in our nation is 12
that mustache tho
The people you meet in China are just rude. Its not a culture thing. A lot of people in China today doesnt represent Chinese culture well.
Why does the video always start over when I'm commenting? I always wait till the end but then that happens, Anyway, Welcome Back Derrick, Love the beard Ryan, Love Paco & "Purple Elephant" even tho you didn't say it!!!!!!  Love the Podcast, hope it never changes!!!!!!!!
I've been to movies in china and they audience there was very quiet and normal, so maybe not all
When are you going to do a Dear Ryan?
HK is mainly cantonese, but everyone speaks mandarin there anyways, just learn mandarin
the part were Paco was talking about him associating things with people he cares about, is something I can relate to.. My ex girlfriend loves Harry Potter, so i decided to watch them since she enjoys them so much. I ended up watching all of them except the last two movies, because we broke up before i watched those two. so now every time i try to watch the last two, i start thinking of her.
HAHAHAHAAHAH the incestception part
Paco with that internet icon shirt
Dear Ryan, Can you sneeze with your eyes open?
Almost unsubscribed when Ryan didn’t know who Ralph from the Simpsons was
ryan. get this. game of thrones trailer.
WAIT WHAT THE AGE OF CONSENT IN THE PHILIPPINES IS 12?!!!!
I would love to be friends with Derrick since i love talking about marvel movies and none of my friends actually care about these movies as much as i do 😐😒😕
Dear Ryan, would you try creating a spanish drama? please
Derrick, hit me up, I've kept up with every marvel and DC movie. Paco and Ryan dont know nothing about the superhero movies lol
russians aint as tough as canadians and dont u forget it foo
Everyone who makes comments quoting the video is high rn
I feel bad for paco :/
Dear ryan can you please do an actually goid music video

Mildcard
Hour and TEN MINUTES this time? You're really spoiling us this time :)
Why does rhpc seem to not like paco
I’m a mixture of Derek and Sean
41:45 im a christian and yall good. No reason to apologize lol. Some Christians get offensive about anything and basically they're idiots. I think it's more on the person and how they are then what they're religion is. I just think they are a bunch of Christians that paint the name bad for the rest of us. 

It is crazy how people can talk about this religion badly though (not saying they did) but as for other religions, you say one thing and BOOM everyone hates you lol.

Idk why im typing so much on a YouTube comment so later and subscribe to pewdiepie🤙
My thoughts is that the gauntlet works using the conservation of mass theory. Thanos can’t make a second world or double the food because he’d have to get the mass from somewhere, which would take it from some of the other world with starving people. This also applies to how I know the Avengers are coming back; they’re not dead, they’re mass was scattered around and their soul is in the gauntlet. Not gone, just moved around. Mass conserved, just in a different way. Thoughts?
Watermelon will 🍉
1:10:46 of ryan and derrick dissing paco
Dear Ryan can you make a rap about The Avengers: End game ?
Related to the alcohol conversation about differences in permitted drinking ages, I'd say that Americans wanting to drink once they hit that legal age is influenced by the risk-taking nature that Americans are known for as a society. Of course, that might not be the only thing, but I would also like to put out that certain societies, those that have more drinking problems, may just glorify the concept of drinking more than others. When you were talking about how kids in France can drink, they probably have lower rates of alcoholism because the concept of drinking is normalized into the culture. In contrast, a large percentage of the American population can't drink because they're not 21, and so that causes people to yearn for the ability to do so.
Dear Ryan, can you make a happy tree friends parody?
You’re the least again dudes ever
Dear ryan when are you making a dear ryan
Why does it seem that if you take the IQ of Derrick and add it to the IQ of Paco, the number would reach less than the IQ of Ryan
How to be ninja as hol
Dear  Ryan please please do an avengers infinity war trailer on a budget
Derrick talks?
It's hard to stop eating meat... I did it.... (not to save the animals...)

Jajajaja me encanto DURO duro el muchacho el sabe lo que dice jejejjejejejeje . no te pongas tam serio jejejjejjejeejjeje . alo brutality
using phones in theatres ain't our culture. just some rude people.
34:10 it's been scientifically debunked. Thanos and people who believe in this haven't done their research. Which makes the reason comic Thanos did it ironically make more sense (he did it for a girl....who happened to be death herself). There's a YouTube video specifically stating he's evil and wrong.

Did you know that we are 12 years away from catastrophe, YOU should go watch lil dicky’s new music video EARTH and go help save the planet
Dear Ryan, do you still do Dear Ryans?
We’ll cross that bridge when we get there
no no wait if im not wrong they said the Infinite stone cant create stuff but take stuff from other place to create the stuff
51:24 think those who are rich and kill themselves are the ones abusing drugs and alcohol to stay happy and it just makes it worse ending in suicide
did derrick broke up with erika or its another person?
In the UK i believe the legal age to drink alcohol outside of a bar is technically 5 years old. You only have to be 18 in a pub. If you are in a pub eating a meal you can have an alcoholic drink with it at 13 if you're with someone 18.
I love Paco’s watermelon shirt!
Dear Ryan, what the hell is Teehee!
They’ve gotten to mature.  I can’t watch        I miss the old Ryan 😔😞😢
It was at 1:03:20 I realised that Paco is wearing a watermelon shirt😂😂
They really don't seem to treat paco warmly or respect him. You can tell it hurts him but he can't say anything.  Paco might do dumb stuff but I feel like he just wants to be accepted as someone besides the scapegoat for once. Honestly really uncomfortable and hard to watch sometimes.
It's Watermelon Will.
Derrek sounds like he smokes
Dear Ryan can you make a liberty kids parody

Unlucky 13th episode! Spooky! Meh, Ryan is too good to be taken by bad luck.
ugh tell me about it! I feel like most movies now a days are always based of something that’s already happened or based of something already existing like a book and stuff Lololol it’s pretty sad when you think about it, like what you said how were the ones buying into it :’)
Yooooo dat stache dooooooeeeee.

Start doing dear Ryan’s, like this if you want dear Ryan’s to start again.
I'm from Hong Kong and the culture here is the same as Macau, but yea shows here are boring and nobody likes to talk or clap, and movie theaters are the wooorrsstt
I relate to Derek with Marvel, except maybe a lot more about Marvel. This movie “Endgame” is the culmination of 22 movies. It’s called the Infinity Saga. There’s obviously gonna be more movies and a new journey of phases and new heroes. This one is just the ending and tough landing for the original 6 Avengers.
The thing about half the population disappearing and trying to solve it another way is impossible. The question isn't that there aren't enough resources, it's the people itself. People are the problem.
Purple elephants
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there”
DERRICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DEAR RYAN. make video for 20M subscribers please,  I never watch you miles stones though, ^_^
12 yr old kids who make a crime can be arrested or imprisoned. Pedophilia is still illegal which means 18under relationships are still illegal.
Of course Paco is the one that doesn’t watch marvel movies
Dear Ryan, can you save PewDiePie please in your next video ?
the ramen thing isnt real
WE WANT BGA BACK !
Dear, Ryan do b boy for a dsy
Dear Ryan, can you make trick shots using your dogs like with dogfood
Ryan already revealed his “secret” thing in his song
Well Adam and eves is obviously impossible to be the spawn of humanity because they had 2 sons, cabe and abel
oh thats why rich people like to live in 3rd world counties, cause no one has freedom there so they can fit in just nice. haha jk the rich run everything there to begin with.
duuuude its the watermelon shirt that paco had in internet icon
Local Macau citizens right here, the majority of us actually speak Cantonese! Mandarin is more like the minor dialect and it is more common in tourist areas since most of the tourist are mainland Chinese.
I hate how these types of videos don't get a lot of views because this is what Ryan wants to do and a lot of people don't watch it and don't support it
I wanna see Daina on the next off the pill pleeeeaase
Dear Ryan pls make a parody of Death Note
Regarding to the part where you guys talked about Adam and Eve and how do their children make children. They don't have female siblings. So they find their partners somewhere else. Also don't make fun of religions

Im just curious, I’ve recently started watching nigahigas channel again, last time I watched was when the songs like bromance,shed a tear and nice guys just got out. I noticed he no longer hangs out with guys like chester see or kevjumba. What happened to those people? Im just curious. That’s all.
hello
This is boring
Can i still say a "Dear Ryan"? If so Dear Ryan Can you use a airsoft gun and shoot yourself 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times

Where can I get that watermelon dress shirt?
32:56 Lmao
Derrick is high af
I miss nigahiga s old videos
didnt know paco was such a cucked. ryan is right with his analogy about race. on a global scale asians is on par if not richer/influential than whites. america does not represent the world. just because asians are not being cast in hollywood doesnt mean theyre underrepresented. 5% vs 15% is a huge gap and blacks are part of the american culture so obviously they are more represented. but blacks know theyre irrelevant outside of US
Ryan, thanos erase half the living things in the universe not the world so making a second earth would be pointless to his plan, it wasnt just earth, that why spiderman died he wasnt on earth when he died
So Paco’s Notre Dame comment is dumb. Of course you could feed the homeless but it’s their money and they can donate to whom ever they want. The jobs it’s going to provide and the supplies they will need will stimulate the economy, it’s also bringing people together from all around the world. It’s like if the Statue of Liberty went down or got damaged people from all over the place would come together to help fix it.
You should have a second channel for podcasts, so we can just watch all of them and you won't have to "risk" losing viewers for your regular videos i guess. All the true podcast lovers would sub to it
Dear Ryan can you twerk on a hoverboard

Actually captain America calls thor's hammer to him while in the final fight.
Yes he is worthy.
I'm just telling this cause I have seen the leaked footage before Disney removed it.
I ain't lying my fellow lamps.
Poor Paco
I like it that it has been only 21 minutes since the podcast has been released and a majority has watched the whole video.
I love that he is doing something he loves but I kinda miss the old vids

Bruh how many likes since vids been out and it's an hour long. Yt be fibbing
Ryans channel is dying,its sad tbh.
Wow the quality has gone down so much
It's literally cringy now
Dear ryan make a remix for the office theme song
tbh, paco is not funny. he is crazy and uncontrollable and a threat. people who are aware of this will laugh it off because paco is the type of dude where he does wacky things out of insanity, so they have no choice but to laugh or hand paco off to the authorities. paco is often articulate to the point where he knows he can use his size and facial expression to intimidate, if not, make someone else subjective to his craft, aka, manipulation. if ryan likes to be 'manhandled' by paco getting it in the rear, then that's ryan. pretty sure derrick don't want any of it. I myself don't find paco that much entertaining. however, pretty sure paco can do all dares, or he already had.
Please take Paco off the podcast. Ryan is the only one consistently saying anything interesting or meaningful.
Ryan can you shave you look like an old creepy guy
First dislike
What the hell happened to you Ryan make those funny videos these videos just don't feel right.. This is not what your channel is about

Well, I should mention, that Macau isn’t technically part of China. It used to be a Portuguese colony, and then was handed over to China. Since it was part of a western country, it became really rich, at least richer than China. Same thing Hong Kong, but Hong Kong was a British colony.
If this is gray you are gay

David: “People hated me cause u was so passionate about apple”
Ryan: “It’s not just that tho, caus-”
David: “And I kept cutting you off. I apologize for that.”
My only question I want answered ever since the beginning of time, How did "TeeHee" come into existence
everyone breathes into the mic the end
me: wow i actually hate this part
ryan 3 seconds later: i wonder if people hate this part
Wait, people didn't like David on the podcast?! Thats my favourite episode this far because of the banter!😁 Hope this ep is the same!
Dear Ryan please do an avengers endgame or infinity war trailer on a budget
xD
It was great having David back!



DAVID IS A CAN OF BALLS!
When is greg and daina gonna come on the podcast?
David is can of balls🙋🏻‍♂️
Ps: I don't agree that I don't learn anything by watching your podcats. I think knowing other point of views of many topics can help you grow as a person.
And it remembered me that succes it's something you earn by hardwork like you're doing Ryan. So thank you Off The Pill🙋🏻‍♂️
Okay guys can we just take a minute to appreciate that Ryan has been uploading vids without failure for the last 12 weeks - we’re all proud of you man, keep it up!
I am from Hawaii and I LOVE THE COLD and Ryan's justification is exactly me, I am finally understood.


Also David is a can of balls :P
I wanna hear Ryan talk more about his Japanese side. Can you speak it
Editor: How long do you want these podcasts?


Ryan: Yes
55:01 who else misses Paco?🙋🏾‍♀️
I like david but i admit i was a bit wary about this ep bc of the last ep he was in. So glad he came back tho, that was brave of him after the hate and backlash last time 😂 and this ended up being such a good ep too, i was absolutely into all the topics they discussed, the cannibalism, being more ethical with the food (im not vegan or even vegetarian for that matter but their points were super interesting) and dont even get me started when they started talking about aliens!!!! 👽👽👽😍😍😍 ive had the same "conspiracy" as ryan for years! Wish theyd talked about that more, for the whole podcast even 😂 but they did say they were going to wait for derrick to talk about that (HES FINALLY BACKKK 😍😍😍).

Missed paco but will does a great job as moderator too. Hope paco had a great time in japan! 

I dont think ryan needs to make the podcast more "educational" or anything, its honestly so much fun to hear them talk about randon stuff bc they always give such insightful opinions anyway.

About the cannibalism, they should search about that plane that crashed in Los Andes, i think it was people from chile or something but some of their mates died and they had to eat some of them to survive. It happened a longgg time ago which is probably why they didnt know about it cause theyre young haha, but im sure they would find it interesting since they were discussing it this ep. 

Love you so much ry and rhpc & friends!

PS: david is a can of balls 😂
I'm sure something like this is posted somewhere out of the nearly 2k comments left here, but since I can't find anything myself...
If humans were to stop eating meat, the world would actually GAIN food.

Sounds counter-intuitive, but as part of the way meat is industrially grown, those animals are being fed things like corn and soybean, plants that humans use for food as well. 
Yet, you definitely do not get a 1:1 ratio of pounds of edible plants fed to animals to make meat:pounds of meat you get back out. Some of that food being fed to an animal goes toward making muscle, which we eat as meat. Most of it goes to keeping the animal alive because it needs to satisfy its own metabolic needs. Therefore, it's more efficient to just directly eat the plant crops that you've grown than to feed it to an animal to make a small amount of meat.

However, animals fed on things other than human crops (ex: grass-fed beef, free-range chickens eating weeds and bugs, pigs eating food scraps) would be adding to the overall amount of food because they are not consuming food that could have been otherwise used to feed human beings.
I would like to know what Kyle’s relationship with Ryan is like and the rest of RHPC
I'm in university taking my degree in Animal Health and basically dogs (and other species including livestock) have been bred over a long period of time for different purposes.


For example hunting dogs, herding dogs, etc. They are probably more valuable as working dogs than being bred for food purposes (which I don't think there is a specific breed for food purposes?). They have also been selected for neonatal features  (smaller, big eyes, etc.) which makes them cuter as pets compared to their ancestors wolves. 


Livestock on the other hand has always been bred for food purposes and other byproducts as a result like leather (as far as I know). There are specific breeds better for producing milk compared to specific breeds for the best beef production, etc. as well.


I personally couldn't bring myself to eat cats or dogs. I am wondering if it's bc they have bigger litters than livestock, have a shorter gestation periods and require less space compared to livestock?
Ryan: People hate me. 
Also Ryan: That's what she said.
Me:
“Wolf”
Ryan: 
“Woof”
David 
Is 
A
Cannonball
Jk, we love u
Dear Ryan can you do if Star Wars took place in the medieval times
Sorry David, I made a negative comment towards you on the first video because I felt you weren't willing to listen to what Ryan was saying and I was quick to just talk trash. You even responded and that's when I realized how childish I was being, sorry we all collectively got you down. It was pretty immature of me.
GMO: Genetically Modified—*forgets the last word*—You know
Why does will look paler every video.......what does Ryan do to him..........

Jk
Yeah, Ryan, you're right! I live where it's cold a lot and I love the heat.
Now that i know Ryan reads the comments, let me add something insightful:

David is a Cannibal.
Although David was much better this time around imo, he should be able to say whatever the heck he wants! Just be yourself dude, this is OTP

David is a can of balls
"People don't really care, about the lives of fish"

Remembers Namjoon
Dear Ryan,
 Can you box sled down your stairs?
love the dummy lessons, do more. genuinely hate the outro. love David.
We need to see more of Marley the Corgi
Off the pill is so underrated
Nobody:
David: Eats guy on plane
Regarding world hunger. 80% of the foods energy disappears every time it goes up a step on the food chain. We would be able to feed so much more people if we didn't produce meat, purely energy wise.
Ladies, when David drops you a DM asking if he could eat you....
Think twice man. haha.
Can you continue the alien talk in the next Off the Pill w/ David!
Please be offended by this comment so I can feel better, Thank you.
Ryan!! You actually have to do another parcourse, please!
I noticed Ryan says wolf with out any L which made me smile.
Malaysia is hot as heck too, I think I'm cold blooded now
I have to agree with Dave. I wonder what humans taste like.
12 consecutive weeks in a row! Go Ryan!
for anyone worried about the plane story they brought up, it's a problem affecting two specific grades of boeing 737max that have a new technology that alters the plane's angle when lifting off. pilots were not being informed about this technology and trying to fight against it, since it uses a different liftoff angle than the traditional 737's they're used to. dr oliver mcgee has written an incredibly in-depth article about this if anyone is curious.
the reason southwest was hit so hard is because the 737max is their primary plane. they use more of them than any other airline.
i just got used to Paco, i keep forgetting he isnt there.
David is a can of balls!!! 😂😂🤣
Gonna grabs some fins if they don't have a PCness of the week. David is a can of balls.
Viewer question: What's the origin of the TeeHee
Lol, all the people hating on an honest guy are just kids I bet. Keep that in mind, there's also kids on YouTube, David.
Hey Ryan do you notice me? Been watching since how to be ninja
There was once in Singapore when there is cold wind for a week, best week ever.
Singaporean here agrees with you about loving the cold. God bless the A.C.
I agree with Ryan I like cold because I live in a Tropical country
Hi a lamp from singapore here 🙋🏾‍♂️ totally agree with what Ryan said about the heat and how we appreciate the cold!! so damn relatable 💯
When Ryan uploads podcast

Hehe why is David back on the podcast?
Dear Ryan: Can you go vegan for a week?
I guess I'm glad I didn't watch this before my recent travel with plane
It's weird how everyone in Hong Kong hates Jackie Chan to the guts, and everyone else in the world loves him.

* insert negative David comment here *
All jokes aside I like the conversations that you guys have with David!
 but David is a can of balls.
WE NEED A CONSPIRACY THEORY SOON!

Just kidding love you all 😂💕💕

Dear ryan, can you survive a zombie apocalypse
44:47
Ryan: "I love the cold."
Me: It literally just snowed here in Minnesota like 5 days ago... I hate the cold but love it.


Edit: Just realized Minnesota got a small shout out :) 


Also, David is a can of balls.
Dear ryan, can you please react and recreate 'Kill This Love' by BLACKPINK ?
“Why don’t we eat dogs and cats?” - Ryan Higa April 14, 2019
When you moved out. Why did you choose Las Vegas to move to?
"I think it's because fish don't scream." I dont know why but this made me laugh so much
David is a can of balls!
Also, I live 1 hour from Minnesota in South Dakota and I prefer cold weather over hot.
Love the alien topic 😀
5:40 😂🤣😂🤣 they should hold an intervention for Ryan lmfaoooo
Eeyyy glad to see David back on the podcast!
Oh poor David will get so much hate for saying that he would eat a dog, I can feel it! 😂.
Man, those mics must be smelly at this point.😖
Dear Ryan,

Can you do a breakup using the titles of Beatles songs?
Fish do not have the neurological capacity for a conscious awareness of pain





SO BRUH THAT SASHIMI'S ON ME FAM
Ryan higa should join the pewds bro army.

Animals are cuddly and playful when they have consistent human affection whether they be dogs, cows, chickens or pigs.  Cats and dogs will be defensive, aggressive or stand-offish without human contact just like the "non-pet" species.  We categorize animals according to how we want to use them and choose to ignore the feelings and unique personalities of those we want to kill.
None of the podcasts member watch Alive? Based on true story about the survivors of a plane crash who ate others (already dead of course) ....to survive...
Dog only tastes kind of like beef... Just kind of chewier. Not tried cat, though

Anyways, great podcast!
Viewer Question: People always talk about "intelligent" aliens, but how do you guys think humans would react if we discovered less intelligent aliens (say same level as a chimp or cow)? Would we eat them? Domesticate them? How would we even determine whether or not it's "intelligent"? 
P.S. Davidisacanofballs 
P.S.S. Thanks for making so much great content throughout the years. Continuously excited for what's to come <3

Please bring Kevjumba into a podcast. We want to see how he’s doing.
Hey, I have some great ideas for the podcast and one of them is bringing a random stranger to the podcast!
It will be very interesting and It can expose you to some opinions from a guy you don't know at all!
Looking forward to see that :D
At around 19:30 when Ryan says like when he's waiting for his flight and he's looking around to see who you would want on your team if you were stranded on an island.. I have never done that but like I'm going on holidays this summer so i guess I'll start then.
I was raised in India, I absolutely LOVE the cold here... Most ppl are shocked when they see me walk around in a T shirt in the cold. I get the same comments : "Aren't you from India"
Me: damn i have a lot of stuff to do and no time

Also me: okay it’s time to leave everything & listen to Ryan talk for an hour
David is a cannibal



Jk we love all of you guys
I agree with the part „I think it’s okay to eat meat but it’s not okay what they do to get the meat“ - that’s the ethical standpoint you have. 
But there are also vegans who go plant based because of our environment and how much meat production, packaging and transport contribute global warming and pollution. 
I‘m not vegan, not even fully vegetarian but I honestly feel in my heart all of us need to strive for an environmentally friendlier lifestyle - just my fifty cents 🤷🏼‍♀️
DAVID IS A CAN ... 
of balls.


Also, David continue talking over because I always laugh at it. :D
They say Davis Choi is still reading the comments to this day
Ryaaaaannn! Is it possible if BEST CREW do reunion? Reunite?
Ryan should have a radio station. 
Anyone with me?
You should make an eating ASMR!!!!!
Some of Jackie Chan’s must watch movies (before Hollywood) are:

Drunken Master
Police Story
Project A
Rumble in the Bronx

and many more....check it out 👍👍
Dear ryan please include captions I reaaaallllyyyy wanna watch all the podcast videos but it gets really difficult for me to keep up with your english there are some words I find difficult to understand cuz it's my second language and I don't think I'm very good at it ...I don't really know why I'm even typing this oh my god you get sooooooo many comments you probably wouldn't be able to read it...
P.S. you're great
David is a can of balls >:O






I really wanna continue the alien theory i love theory stuff (As well as the viewer questions)
Oh god this guy again 


Jk we love David ur doing amazing sweetie
What form do you think aliens take? And Ryan, have you tried lucid dreaming or astral projecting again after that first paranormal incident? 
---David is a can of balls.
Love the podcast, keep it going y'all👍
I was listening to this podcast while cleaning my room and by the end of it, i was sat in front of the laptop completely engrossed in your conversation. Literally forgot about cleaning my room and tbh i am not even mad. It was reallly good, guys! 

Also, david is a can of balls.
David is a can of balls(not).
Love the podcast guys! And for what its worth...

Ryan please put Alex Kawaguchi on one of your podcasts. I will love you forever. Both you and Alex are very funny and I think you’d get along
Yes David, I love the cold! it's too hot in Hawaii all the time.
David is a can of balls 👌
Ryan, I just want to say I appreciate you breaching this topic, I know I spammed the comment section, but I just wanted to use this opportunity to talk about this industry. I appreciate how you don't shy away from these topics. 


The cruelty and detrimental environmental effects of these industries are the reason why vegans are so angry. I just wanted to share the knowledge that I've discovered. I respect the forum that you have here, thank you.


Just know that, I know that not every can go vegan right away. One way you can help is to gradually wean yourself off of animal products one by one. What I always tell people is that, if there's an animal product that you feel you can't go without, then go "vegan" except for that product.
One of the best episodes ever, plz have David in your podcast more often! I loved your conversations
Dear Ryan,
I challenge you to make a masterpiece of a video but make the edits the worst you can ever make.
The irony is that I love david and I always want him to be in the podcast,

for years ive been watching him he bacame one of my inspiration in music and humor
"but that woof, we can kill that woof" -ryan higa 2019

David is starting to get weirder and weirder every podcast 😂
I dont get people hatin on david. I love him. Also, I can relate to Ryan with loving the cold, I'm from the Philippines btw.
U should bring KSI has a guest

Leave your dear Ryan here! 





No need to like this comment just reply your dear Ryan here.
it gets hotter in australia. and we dont have A/C and we're fine
O my lol I am from Wisconsin over here and I love the cold.  So Ryan would it be too cold for you in winter in Wisconsin.
Hey Ryan and the crew ! 
A french lamp of yours from long time, not hardcore fan at all though i'll admit, just watching occasionnaly your videos. Came accross this new concept and I really like it and the way it is recorded (both audio and video). Very good idea guys ;) ! Keep rolling and have your fun ! I'll watch as i can ! 


I'll just mention one thing that i have some trouble with : the One Hour Format. 
I find that 1 hour is too much for me. I manage to focus for like 15, 20 minutes and then either i start doing stuff on my phone or something comes up and i have to pause. And when i come back later in the day, or few days later, hard to "get back into it" in the middle. I don't know why but those discussions make me think of "TED talks" and i feel like, 15 to 20 minutes is a better suited format for that. And i feel like it makes kinda of sense since you don't talk on the same subject for one hour. Why not divide it smaller videos per Subject ? 

Anyway, best luck for you guys ! 
You are still the best and most achieved content that can be found on Youtube ;) (in my modest Lamp opinion)
Omg David is a can of balls!!!😂
(Dear Ryan) can u talk arabic?PLZ...
Only the real ones will know that David has actually bin in multiple videos years befor such as BEST CREW - auditions
I'm from Hawaii and didn't have A/C either and I prefer being cold (except I hate snow).
And I totally thought that if someone's house had aircon and an inclosed garage not just a carport that they were really rich too, lol
Rumble in the Bronx is so good 😭
Really enjoy watching and listening to these podcasts, keep up the good work Ryan. p.s David is a can of balls!
Dear Ryan, make an Old Town Road (Lamp Edition).
awww why is everyone being so mean to David?? Love seeing everyone together & stumbling onto this podcast has been w o n d e r f u l.

I really enjoyed the conversation about animals—I study psychology with an interest in Animal Behavior and I canNOT believe some people’s beliefs sometimes (a guy told me, “fish don’t feel pain right??” what???) so this was a really fun lil conversation to follow.

Keep it up, love tuning in ♡
can you do another Kpop video plzzzzzz and a s/o
David is a Can of Balls.
Got instantly hook on that alien part though
I'm totally fine with whatever you two said, I did not see anything wrong with David's comments last podcast. Cheer up David
There's enough food in the world to feed everyone. It's not about the quantity of food, it's about the distribution of food that causes third world countries to starve.
You published this at my b. Day😊😊😊
I grew up in Utah, we get extreme cold, and extreme heat. I hate both

David is a can of balls
Love these podcasts idk if you’ll read but David is my favorite guest and I fully support him being on this more

Will is a real one for knowing the Jackie Chan Classics!
I get a lot of news from this podcast I also like actually listening to this podcast, I normally like using podcasts as background noise but I watch off the pill podcast vids
I loved every second of that 😂
david: head
will: heart
ryan: conflicted
Who would even hate on David? Wth is wrong with humanity? They’re just friend with strong opinions and they won’t give up on their point of view... 🤷🏻‍♀️
You’re loved David! 💜
Let's not forget plants are living too
Can you make a Apex legend trailer like what you did with fortnite
also what are you going to name your new fish?!???
Do another song with BGA
god when David said "circle of life" I immediately thought of The Lion King
Was definitely on a Southwest flight while I listened to this😂
Seems like a group of compassionate people here, and i like that this conversation took place, because it shows veganism is growing. A lot of arguments here were low level against veganism, you should talk to someone who knows about the topic of veganism, its very interesting and informative.
Hey, people did live in deserts back thn with no electricity.. Specially the middle East came to my mind.. Well there is this another possibility too..that with time and all these pollution problems and ozone layer being effected we got climatic changes so maybe thats why in this age it will be even worse to live without our modern necessities or maybe. It'll be more difficult cuz we're used to live dffrntly thn how early men used to live.. 
Whatever...
 David is a can of balls.
Dear Ryan: continue the parkourse series plz 🙏🏼
Just in case you're worried about flying,  I believe most airlines have grounded the faulty planes or allow you to reschedule a flight that would be on the faulty planes.

If you're worried just check if your flight is on a 737 Max. Those are the plans they're evaluating.
Love the podcasts so far 👍 keep it up
The dislike is Paco because he got kicked off
Veganism is just trying your best to cause the least amount of harm to living creatures as practically possible, which is something I believe we should all be moving towards 🙏
"David is a can of balls"
Please come again, David! 😁
I'm having trouble listening to the podcast on Google Play.
( best podcasts tho, favourite one is the ghost stories one on higa tv)

I always watch until the end...

People generally rarely eat carnivores which cats and dogs(to some degree) are
im from singapore and i COMPLETELY AGREE WITH RYAN about the cold thing
Gotta agree with Will about watching Rumble in the Bronx and Drunken Master. Those are some good movies to watch!!
lol I can’t stop thinking abt how pale will is😂😂😂 cuz like me too lmao
david’s a can of balls:

do you guys ever just think that when they’re talking abt something and you think in your mind “i hope they talk abt —“ or like what you want to say and then they start talking abt it and you’re like “yess”
Will!! It's "converse"  not "conversate"
1. If we evolved to survive then why are people killed, killing and starving?
2. Can ape evolve again?
Did David make a cameo in Shazam (bus scene)?
David! I saw u in Shazam😂

I've had dog meat twice in Cambodia in the past. It's not bad. 
Shameless plug... I will probably upload a video showing one of those times soon IF EVER.... 🙄
I lived I Colorado until I was 7 then moved to Florida. FRICKEN HATE the heat
I feel you David. That's what my friends says about me, and I too am aware of being honest.
Not all Singaporeans LOL i have colleagues who hate the cold! XD I however LIVE for the cold XD
Why no headphones for David?
45:12 I live in Colorado, but I moved from Texas where it was always warm, I relate with that so much
Why does the breathing at the end make me so uncomfortable?🤣
I grew up in Russia, and you guessed it- it was way colder there than where I live now. Australia. And OMG I feel so bad about the temperature here.
MY mum always wears hoodies, etc. And I am always hot and sweating.
David Choiw down on that guy because we would eat him first
Does anyone else have anxiety about the inevitability of death? Or death in general?...like the fact that we don't know when it's coming but it IS coming is unnerving. I don't even wanna think about it but it's always on my mind. I could be on my way to work and at the same time thinking "hmm there's hundreds of ways I could actually die at this moment" or when someone dies and you're like "dang this person didn't know today would be the last day"... anyways is exhausting
Ive noticed the drop in your views and just watched the "if i quit youtube" video. Here to say i love the new content and keep it up.
# dear ryan, can yow do a  marley trick shot? 
p.s I like Strawberry
Lmao “David is a Can of Balls!” 😂😂
Dear Ryan can you make a movie trailer about the pewdiepie vs t-series thing?

P.S Thanks for being the person you are
18 seconds ago!! This is the earliest I have been oh my god
You don't think you are smart? Dude you make great videos and have 21M subscribers. You are smart.
Im from Guam where its climate is practically the same as Hawaii's. I loooove the cold and hate it that its always humid.
I didn't even notice the way they were talking was different. Probably because my friends and I talk the same way: interrupting and almost too sarcastic. Our teachers think were being mean but were really not; were just being us
David is a can of balls
you guys brought up, bringing up "smarter subjects" in a dumb way.
 i think you found out how to break laymen terms into layman terms lol any way breaking down a subject to simple words shows you fully get it to its simplist form. its the least laziest thing you can do and explaining the essance of the subject like you did is not only good for your memory but shows a full grasp of a subject.  thats pretty smart if you ask me :)
David has such a stupid name 


checks own name

fook
I'm from MN and I love the cold. We have cold winters BUT we also have super hot summers as well. Our weather is pretty bipolar
I actually really love tese podcasts. It's like how me and my friends just used to talk
David is a can of balls 

But i still respect him
i tought you guys keep Paco locked in this room. can'abouls
27:39 Will you are correct. In India beef is illegal. You can't kill cows as they are considered holy or something like that. I love how you guys discuss every possibilty there is. I love OTP.
I’m in love with you all and these podcasts, thank you
Dear Ryan, can you do another parkours? (Plz those are rly funny)
Dammit why is David back on the podcast.
can you please release the podcast with derrick? 😭 i'm pretty sure that would be interesting  🤣
Who's voice is the part where they sung "OFf OFf OFf the pill
rumble in the brox is lit asf hhahaha for real
David is a canonball! Tbh, I weirdly like it when you guys blow on the mics
David's a Can of BALLS!
I love these podcasts , you speak real opinions but im glad you brought up veganism because im a vegan and i know that plants have every nutrient you need to survive , but im glad you gave your opinions about it
Dear Ryan, please do another episode of Reginers and Seandies/ Pacies 😅
David is a can of balls😂 so I saw “Off the Pill” on the podcast app I was soo happy because when the first episode came out I searched for it but couldn’t find it💕
David is a can of balls!!!!! Btw keep the breathing. Love it👍hilarious
David is a can of balls..... great podcast guys!
21millionto scribers I never heard of you
David is a fun and talented dude. I just hope he realises most of the hate wasnt uncalled for. It made sense why people felt that way.
44:40 I agree with Ryan on this one. I'm from a tropical country (Philippines <3) and although I'm not in love with snow and winter, I think my tolerance for the cold is higher. When I travel around S.Korea during autumn (October), I feel awkward wearing a single long-sleeved shirt while the locals are wearing layers of down jackets >_< , and in winter, while the locals still wear their thermal wears indoors, I immediately have to strip down my layers because I'll be sweating all over. I once volunteered in a mountain organic farm (November) and my hosts were actually amazed at how I don't seem to be cold when they're already freezing. At the same time, when we went to the sauna and entered a 40degC room, I was like "oh, it's just like an ordinary summer day back at home :p
 Oh my!!! that makes sooo much more sense! Yes, please do talk more about this alien thing next time :D I've never believed those "aliens" because I figured that in the vastness of the universe, I doubt aliens would look remotely anything like humans, standing on two-legs and stuff. But if they are evolved humans, time travelling back or something, that would make soo much more sense :D
Im from california and its the same for me. I go to school in pittsburgh and im always wearing less layers than the people who are from here
Will is so soft spoken but he has such insightful things to say
I live in the middle east and its soo hot here, I love the cold. And I usually wear light clothing in winter even when I go to the Uk or northern US/Europe.
Ryan higa is handsome and very intelligent so he will soon understand that my point.   Fish is bad due to plastics residue, toxic materials, mercury.   Eating meat is not our natural diet that is why so many illnesses associated with meat.
The thing is, animal agriculture is super inefficient for the economy and is actually contributing to world hunger.


(These statistics are pulled from Cowspiracy, the documentary.)


-1.5 acres can produce 37,000 lbs of plant-based food
-1.5 acres can produce only 375 lbs of meat


If we used that land to produce plant-based food instead of meat, then we would be able to produce exponentially more food for the world.

Environment:
-Going one year without paper, saves 8.5 trees. Going one year without beef, saves 3, 432 trees.
-Animal agriculture is the leading cause of global warming, deforestation, species extinction, water depletion, and ocean dead zones. Animal agriculture is the source of 51% of all greenhouse gases. If you're talking the percentage of global greenhouse emissions, transportation sectors produce 13%, whereas cattle, by themselves, produce 18% of that gas.
*If you think about it, you have to raise a living being for a certain amount of time, using crops and water that could be going towards human beings until it is time to slaughter them.
-To product one pound of animal protein vs one pound of soy protein, it takes about 12x as much land, 13x as much fossil fuel, and 15x as much water. (This is all put forth to raise an animal. It is way more efficient to raise crops that you can eat. An animal also creates a lot of waste. That waste contributes to methane gas, pollution of the water ways and land when they dump it...)
-Approximately 880-1000 gallons of water goes into making 1 gallon of milk
-If you track the average daily water footprint of certain diets. It takes approximately 300 gallons of water for a vegan diet, 1200 gallons for a vegetarian diet, and 4000 gallons a day for a meat-eater diet. (Source: John Robbin's "Diet for a New America")


-On one day of a vegan diet, you save 1100 gallons of water, one animal's life, 30 sq feet of forested land, 45 pounds of grain.
.
I love you David! The hate was undeserved
I like david like to agree
I used to watch Wassabi Production a long time ago... I realised that they started youtube before Ryan
I'm from the Philippines and I can totally relate to Ryan appreciating ACs or being cold because I'm so tired of feeling sweaty all the time and the feeling you get when you enter a cold room is just the best.
Lol i'm from singapore and i still prefer heat to the cold. It's the humidity that really gets ya. BUT feeling the AC on a hot day is a blessing
Dear Ryan can you tell us which place you find the most perfect for vacation and why, in the next video, please :D
I was so hyped when I saw David in the thumbnail, I love him
bout to debunk your theory, im swedish and i like the cold
DaViD's A cAn Of BaLlS
moved to vegas 2 years ago from hawaii, oahu, neber wanna go back to the humidity and heat all year around lol i look forward to the winter gym shorts and t-shirt xD
Tfw David is a can of balls 😂

"Dude, cows are freaking cuuute"
I miss Paco ;-;  BUUT I would probably have eaten a human before a dog 😂 thought David wasn’t trolling when he said that 😭
Dear Ryan, can you be Shazam
It's not the same without Paco 😔
I dont wanna add to the David hate but he's too close to the mic, like especially when he pronounces "P's".. anyone else?😂
You guys should 100% get Timothy DeLaGhetto on the podcast
Fish have feelings,  too
Yikes, David is hilarious. 🤗🤗🤗
Cannonball Dave 
Cannonball Dave
Everybody clap cause' Dave ate my face
I think that the fact none of you are college grads speaks a lot about hard work and dedication. You all made a successful career by working hard and knowing when to take an opportunity. I also like listening to your podcasts because your topics are interesting and it reminds me of how I talk to my friends.
I'm pretty sure it's a Boeing 737 MAX
I'll tell you what we really need; a Ninja Melk sequel
Im going on a 23 hr flight next month😭😭
Aw it’s fine david most of us just comment what we notice, but the way you handled it was really cute
I don't think it's always about learning something when you listen to a podcast. i like to hear your opinions and a lot of times i felt reassured because i am not the only one having a specific opinion. so please keep going with the way it is. :)
Please make a new BgA song, the who's it gonna be sequel.
David is a can of balls ~ I love your podcasts
Dear Ryan:Can you make a realistic painting of yourself? If this is put in. Vid I would be so happy

You make amazing vids by the way, your one of my favorite
From Minnesota and I love the cold/snow ☃️☃️☃️☃️❄️
It is Boeing 737 MAX not Boeing 737 .. max had some new "updates" which were faulty
Ryan's podcast needs 2 more microphones
simple just think of it as a person who wasted them spare time on you
He was bettee around this time lol
David's a can of balls
Please, talk more about aliens and conspiracies ^^
David's totally chill, it's one thing to criticize someone but when you add hate to it you reveal your insecurities. You'd never bash someone for minor things like that with that sort of passion IRL. You're just venting.
if you love the cold why did you decide to live in Las Vegas 😂

“Let’s eat this woof”- Ryan higa 2019
Episode 13 for Parkourse plz?
ryan can you please change your profile picture
29:00 its so interesting to hear your honest thoughts on this matter, especially since a lot of things you guys talk about you arent necessarily experts in and there may be a lot of information youre unaware of but you speak about it so simply and honestly that its still entertaining/rewarding/interesting in a sense. about ryan implying humanity would starve without meat, animal agriculture actually wastes such an insane amount of resources (water, soy, etc - fun fact a lot of soy plantations exist to feed cattle) that if used differently could probably end world hunger. theres also the fact that meat consumption is the leading cause for climate change, so i think many vegans me included just find that eating meat comes with such a big amount of harm towards the world on so many different levels that its simply not worth it. all in all its not that easy e.g. there is certain type of soil thats barren and thus could feed more people if it was used for animal agriculture or that so many of our mainstream products come from companies that mistreat and exploit their workers so where do we draw the line in not supporting any cruelty practicing companies when most of us dont have the kind of money to get everything locally i hope im making sense but you get what i mean i hope yknow so its just ehhh theres this and theres that and in the end we just have to be honest with ourselves and decide
Ryan. I'm still waiting for that podcast with  Alan.
i do my math homework to the podcast every week, and have a short dance break at the shishi break - it was shorter this week!!
Am I the only one who wants more Skitzos
I need Paco to stay as a permanent member on this show please. I mean if it's cool. ( ._.)
I love David. I want him in every episode, but again I will miss Paco, so they should come for alternate podcasts.
Can we just talk about how awesome Will is? He's super thoughtful in these podcasts!
i don't like this. the macbook in front of ryan. it brings more evidence into the conversation making it sound like a discussion. i like the conversation where they all come with what they want to say without anything other than their ownselves and intuition to back it up






but then again i'm being nitpicky so its ok whatever they do 








david is a can of balls but i like david
We need KevJumba on the podcast!!!
Pls could you bring back parkour
I still don't know why fish is not seen as meat. fish are animals right, why is their flesh not considered 'meat'?
After that vice amputated foot story, i had to read it. Apparently in USA only in Idaho it can land you in prison. So go at it, david 😂
The vegan talk triggered me a little. The important thing for me is that you are conscious about you being selfish and you are fine with it. It sucks but it's honest. The cultural or the "if I learned it before" thing i don't fully understand, but it goes with the selfish personality. It's ok tho, and i prefer honesty and coherence than "everything is love" stuff
I love when divid is on the podcasts 👍🏻
Dear, Ryan you should do boomerang trick shots
O please I put a good comment I love David.
i feel so laid back knowing twosetviolin nigahiga and david choi before pewdiepie





 you are making me feel old and yet i am freaking twelve
I'm Singaporean and I approve Ryan's assessment on the heat
Why is Elon musk on the podcast?
From his videos i thought Ryan would be less PC than this.
Where is Will (Paco)?! We miss you bro. I mean the podcast is great but without you it's weird.i dkn something missing dude.:(
Yoooo David has such a nice voice like 😩
David you're a hack!


You better come back for another podcast amigo
Ryan and crew: starts talking about cannibalism
Me: STOP IM EATING CHICKEN!!
Ahaha drunken master is a classic!
David is a cannibal/cannonball/can of balls. ALL WORK
Hey Ryan! I adore your  content and i appreciate that your a really down to earth guy. I for sure agree with you on the life or death situation if there was absolutely no choice to eat meat I honestly don't know if I would but in that moment i would be thinking differently..
So we are fortunate to have the choice and factory farming is definitely not necessary, in any way. We are currently growing enough grain to feed over 3 billion people but all of that goes to feed livestock while 800 million people die of starvation.
And all animals are capable of love and pain and have feelings but not many of people form friendships with cows like they do with dogs, I've seen very affectionate, happy cows but those lived in a safe environment.
Anyways thanks for being considerate its a bit of a triggering subject lol but its something that should be talked about more. There's so much research that  points out all the negative effects that factory farming has on everything. And ethically there is no way to kill a being that wants to live.  
Your guppies sound so cute!!
I got sad after though. You should look up the current state of our oceans, its scary. Sorry this is so long I usually don't leave comments either lol 
oh 
And David is a can of balls :p
Please do a livestream or video to help pewdiepie for the future of individuals on YouTube
LLOOLLLL DAVID IS A CAN OF BALLS
Dear Ryan can you make a video without editing?
why is the cannibal the only 1 not wearing headphones?
i live in Minnesota and legit will only go out if its warm
I just wanna say get introverted is a bop
I feel he's being so cautious while on these podcasts. I was expecting him to open up and share his thoughts no matter what. I felt the same before he announced this new change, before exposed.
Hey David, I was very annoyed by your apple talk on that episode and I did state that it rubbed me the wrong way. Now that I know you have dry sense of humor I'll be more mindful of it in the future. You're not that bad!
I’ve learned about you guys. And I really enjoy listening to you just talking about random things that you don’t know about
Not from Hawaii but born in Georgia where its hot & humid all the time as well & I enjoy the cold.  Shorts, short sleeve shirt & a sweatshirt (usually with the sleeves rolled up) are my all weather getup.
Was just waiting for this. Thank you for being consistent 🤗
Is it just the lighting or is Will just really really fair skinned?
DUDE they're talking about how humans have multiple species at one point, and tier zoo made a video about that at the same day
am from Singapore and YES I AGREE RYAN lol. what's worse than the heat is actually the humidity here; the air is constantly so moist that we perspire easily and is also what causes that 'stuffy' feeling. and yes, we are extremely blessed to have AC in malls and huge fans in MRT stations to keep us cool all the time
45:05 that was just like me back in my time 
I'm half Hawai'ian, but it's so weird that I like the cold too.
Ryan should do one with Vanoss XD or The Anime Man
yes please continue the alien topic
Ryan I'm for maui!! Just reply if your ever coming back to Hawaii...
No, you’re the smart ones for dropping out of college.
I'm from Hawaii and I think my threshold of temperature fluctuation tolerance is pretty low. My ideal temperatures are in the 70s. Anything below or above is uncomfortable :P Everyone is different though. My husband is also from Hawaii and he sweats so easily. He can be wanting to turn on the fan and I'll be wearing layers of clothes :P
I didn't find David annoyed at all but he has a nice personality that some people might have misunderstood. most of all he is a can-of-balls, right?
I love having David on the podcast because he brings a different perspective whether he agrees or disagrees with Ryan whereas I feel like Paco just agrees with Ryan and repeats what he says with a different wording. I mean I don't mind Paco at all. Sometimes I really love the questions he asks and when he gets more serious, but David is possibly my favorite guest so far.
David is a cannibal, cannonball, sack can of balls? Hahaha
Thanks Ryan/RHPC for uploading the podcast 12 weeks straight. I enjoy all of it! Even the breathing mic thing or when you guys are not sync or the dry humour

Looking forward to the next one with David again + the alien stuff (p.s you are not mean at all)
About to grab sleeves cause there was no PCness of the week or viewer questions. Also David is a can of balls and purple elephants. Lol
Love the podcasts really enjoying them and your ending doesn’t bother me. At least I haven’t seen any comments about it either. I really like the topics you guys bring up. The only one I didn’t enjoy so far was when you guys talked about sports I think it was basketball but hey that’s just me I’m not a sports person lol. Keep it up guys!!
I enjoyed the podcast and I dont think you guys are dumb. :P
I gained a lot of respect because of the talk about vegetarianism and Ryan admitting what he thinks about it, thank you so much for that. I just want to add that if we fed poor people the vegetables we feed animals I believe less people would starve because we have to give an animal tons of food and the animal doesn't soak up all those nutrients, it takes time to build muscle and tons and tons of food. We waste so much crops to get meat and have a problem with for example overflowing amounts of animal poop and gases ruining the environment
David is a can-of-balls.
Out of sync in 1.25 and all further speeds fsr
WHAT? David is getting hate? I love him
Okay okay but IF the power went out for you guys during the summer: 
Your best chance at fighting the heat would be to have excessive amounts of water. The reason is, is when your body goes past 109 degrees F the heat will kill all the enzymes your body creates for multitudes of functions and that’s why you’d die from the heat (as far as I understand). Water helps us maintain our body temperature and to ensure that that doesn’t happen. And yes of course you’d want some shade. But water is the priority. But not too much water because then your cells become hypotonic and burst. And you’ll die. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk ya’ll
Keanu Reeves does his own stunts, too.
I'm so confused David was so nice the last podcast! But he is a can of balls.
Could you play parkourse episode 13 in your new house
I love listening to these while I drive to work
NOOOO!!! I love listening to David talk!!! Love you  David!!
Don't be mean to David, he's a cool dude
Unironically I would try human meat if it was consensual. I’m vegan so that would be the only meat I would eat. I’m with David
David is a 'can of balls'......love the podcast, heard them all so.. ryan plss keep doing this.....luv ur utube btw
I heard that conspiracy theory from elon musk, the tesla guy
Dear Ryan can you please make a video about anime...
WE NEED BgA TO COME BACK!!!
I been thinking about if it is possible to get ChesterSee on the podcast?
Sad that whenever it a bad criticism/judgment they comment right away. But I really think this dude is cool. Just do what you do!👍
I JUST woke up...
What an awesome thing to wake up to ☕
Off the pill for my breakfast watching enjoyment... 💚😀💙
Guys this channel is dying....
I remember when nigahiga had close to a million views in just hours
god bless will for his cow knowledge
the people starving usually eat like beans rice etc they can't afford meat, so you are wrong especially in the usa getting rid of slaugher houses like for kfc etc would not ever make people go hungry, theres so much overproduction your argument is invalid


think about venezuela, they don't have fastfood like you do
Yep, dumb it down for us. I like that idea.
Hey, make a Livestream for Pewdiepie ówò
Man, That’s deep.
DAVID IS A CANNONBALL
Yay, David’s back! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love a can of balls especially the ones that are purple.
Just wanted to let you know your podcasts increase my productivity at work, it was risky but I quickly logged in just to write David is a can of bowls (I am aware that the original intended secret phrase was "balls", but bowls are containers. So if there are balls inside the bowls, then technically I'm not necessarily incorrect as David is a can of bowls full of balls. Which also implies that the can is full of balls.)


Boss if you're reading this, I can assure you that i'm being more productive than you as you're scrolling through the youtube comments whereas i'm just listening to podcasts.
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS PLEASE KEEP DOING MORE PODCASTS
David is a can of balls






Boom got him
Worst roast ever ya
I like your videos except these podcasts
LOL Will is more Asian than David and Ryan. Police Story was ace. Loved meals on wheels too.
Will you do any more dear Ryan's'?😕
Damn ryan has the mug going




true podcastor, look how much my child has grown ;-;
Davids a cannibal

They are so off topic. First it was comments then jets
Please remove your video where you revealed your " not so secret girlfriend " because you jokingly put in the Hallelujah song
David is a can of balls? Hahah and they miss paco 😂
Just some book recommendations: My Stroke of Insight by Jill Taylor, The Girl with all the Gifts by M.R. Carey, and Born to Run by Christopher McDougall.
57 mins?????? Hmmmm let me grab some snacks, I'll be right back.

Everyone is crazy. David is great!
David and I share the same kind of humor, but I wouldn't go as far to joke about eating someone. Also, DIACOB (David is a can of balls). And, I actually like the breathing at the end because I imagine myself breathing into an invisible mic lol.
What is your guys favorite conspiracy theories?
Dear Ryan, can you make a parody of bird box?
Dear Ryan, can you make a parody of bird box?
Thanks for the kryptonite.
Response to eating cats and dogs:
Humans just don't generally eat carnivores or predators. No one eats lions, alligators, etc, because they're hard to mass produce. 
We mostly eat herbivores because they're easier to raise (chicken, rabbits, cows, goats, etc), sometimes omnivores (pigs). Occasionally, you'll eat reptiles, maybe parts of a bear, they're just not raised as much.
Also disclaimer: I strongly suggest against eating dogs and cats, because the dog/cat meat industry is very badly regulated, and many come from stray animals or stolen pets, especially in parts of China.
lmao i love the cold too, but im always sick now lmao
PLEASE DO A LIVE STREAM FOR PEWDIEPIE
why are people so salty about david, he was great on the last OTP, I guess people are soft nowadays
David is a cannibal... or a cannonball... or a can of- okay I'm done
The David podcast was honestly the most memorable one for me because of how interesting the topic was and I didn’t even notice David interrupting Ryan because of how invested I was in the conversation topic
Dear Ryan, can you do an endgame trailer movie on budget
Im the best fortnite player
i thought ryan was saying 'woof' instead of 'wolf' lol
Can we have FilthyFrank on OFF THE PILL??
This podcast didn't feel right without paco
I still hear it as cannon balls. I think it's interesting how since humans act and talk based on their own experiences and mindset that they tend to forget hey maybe I'm wrong or maybe I don't have all the information needed. There are people that think of different perspectives and possibilities too and also, people feel the need to protect their opinions and what they like. That is an interesting aspect of the mind that is actually possible to wok with, at least I saw some people do it
Keep the podcasts coming. Ryan's channel should beat T-Series someday.  Make it happen.
Check out the "Meat Eater" series on netflix with Steve Rinella. He gives great insight as to how we should harvest, as well as respect, the meat we're consuming. There's also a couple episodes where he is living and hunting with native tribes in the jungles of Belize, I think, and he is faced with a decision to eat monkey. What is anyone's thoughts on this manner?
David is a great canofballs xD
Please do a podcast 3 times a week 😊
18 seconds  ago This is thi earliest l have been oh my god
My son is ADHD and he cannot stand warm for too long, either, he usually feels comfortable in a way that I feel like he is underdressed for the temperature. Also I think it also depends on your metabolism, if you have a great one and as you already discussed that you go to the loo more than once per day than you are kind of burning energy all the time that would make you feel less cold
davids a cannibal ????? GASP
"To make animals feel as little pain as possible while being slaughtered, we are switching to lethal injections"
I’m from Big island and I lived in Volcano and I LOVE the heat. (For those who don’t know volcano is like the cold part of the big island)
Well at least Ryan didn't experience a fish explosion in a small tank....it's not a pretty sight
David is a can of balls.
tbh i had no idea david received so much criticism. i personally think hes chill tho. 
i think that u guys are right in that i really don't learn anything from your podcasts but i think that's the beauty of them. it's literally just u guys talking about interesting things, i can't help but want to join in. there are times where i wish i could interject with my opinion or perspective and it just shows how interesting you guys are.... anyway. i hate it when you guys breathe on the mics at the end lmaoo but im not looking to grab sleeves tho so yall do yall and it's still entertaining
Hey, I love the cold too,..........the reason Ryan explained applies. If you grew up in a hot place you learn to appreciate the cold.
Can u do more parkourse.
dear ryan, kidnap sean on his birthday but before you kidnap him make decorations, presents, get a cake, go to fun places, more desert, and then kidnap him after you kidnap him in a black blanket so he can't see you take him to the party get him out in a dark room that looks very suspicious and then SURPRISE you got him a great birthday and us a great video :3
You know what really grinds my gears? Hate comments
Man...ur the only person that makes me happy when I'm upset, my friends don't like spending time with me.
I have a southwest flight coming up, thanks guys😒
I actually learn a surprising amount from these.
if you wanna know about canivalism and plane crashes read about the Los Andes plane crash
Today's fact: The man who found the 5,000 year old corpse Ãtzi the Iceman in 1991 (Oldest natural European mummy) was also found dead frozen in ice in 2004.
Ryan Tries: Cannibalism
I moved from South Dakota to DC and I HATE THE HEAT. The humidity. All of it. I love cold weather.
the way Ryan says "wolf"
David is a cannon ballz 
The Boeing 737 plane comes in different models, the newest one (737-Max 8) is the problem plane, those are all grounded. The ones you guys are flying on are the older models.
I'll answer the question why we don't eat cats in dogs. Becouse cats were usful for killing mice and rodents that's were I think it started. We do not eat the usful animals. Something like that
Ryan is the Elon Musk of Youtube.
As someone who lives in the Kalahari desert in South Africa without AC. I can assure you guys that its not that bad. Humans have this weird ability to adjust to their surroundings. Even though its tough...its liveable. So yeah, you will survive without AC in Vegas, Ryan. Just saying😁😁😁
I miss paco :-(
Hey Ryan do a drone trickshots or something like that
No hate, I love you guys but I kind of wish you informed yourselves more before talking about some of these topics... For instance you say that eliminating meat production would result in less food for people, but it’s actually the opposite because a LOT of ressources are spent and wasted on the production of meat that could instead go straight to humans, so veganism actually helps increase the availability of ressources. 

I like that you have genuine serious discussions but please try not to spread misinformation while doing it.
Love for David~
Ryan actually there are people living in the desert.. Tuareg
david's a cannibal, and a canon ball,  and can of balls
Like- Off The Pill(Nigahiga's podcast)
Comment- Impaulsive(Logan Paul's podcast)



Let's see which one is better!!
9:29 Ryan sounds British “such a”
What's going on, a 2-fer?!  Awesome.
David is a CaN oF bAlLS :O
In my country we learn about the types of humans from elementary. And since i study latin too here's a fun fact: homo means human and sapiens means wise so our type is the wise human... I hope im not telling you about an already well known fact😂
DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT DAVID HAS A HAWKEYE HAIRCUT!
DEAR RYAN,can you do a bowling trick shot video
dear ryan can you do the sherlock parody?? Please it will be a great favor
First off, flying is thousands of times safer than driving 
Second, it was the 737 max series specially that crashed and those models have been grounded pretty much in ever country. Third, not all Boeing flights are dangerous, they in fact have the best safety record of all plane companies (airbus, bombardier etc) 4 the craches occurred on scechy airlines (like éthiopien airlines) and could have easily been avoided if the pilots weren’t so dependent on the autopilot (which is were the problem occurred)
Can u do an breakthrough on the brumuta triangle?
Switch will for Paco
CANNONBALL 🤭❤️

STOP MAKING THE PODCASTS SO SHORT PLS, IT HELPS ME SLEEP

And Shanghai Noon by Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Can’t believe Will didn’t mention it lol
Singaporean here, and yea we love our ACs! =)
Why don’t we eat dogs and cats?

Because they are cute? Also because they fight back
Ryan you should make a apex legends movie like how you made the fortnite and pubg movie
Ok now i have to rewatch the other podcast... why were they hating on david !!!!!!
RYAN IS GROWING A STACHE!
The OtP t-shirt design looks like it's partnered with pepsi lol
Glad I found this channel when I did
You should try to get Jay Park and Jun on here. I was so blown away after watching the Bromance video and realizing that it was Jay after getting into KPOP about a year ago. And Jun’s music is so gooood
Dear Ryan, can you come to my house, I live here in Vegas
the reason i've been told why we don't eat cats and dogs is because they're carnivores
dear ryin how ever you spell your name shout out Ryker Jackson plz
Pretend I wrote something and like this comment.
For another dear Ryan can you do a handstand or a backflip?
I live in Hawaii and everytime i go to Vegas in the winter i walways think i need a thick jacket but then i only end up needing a long sleeve because i love the cold.
first off the pill podcast with ads
You used to be the most subscribed youtube channel in 2011
So early! Always look forward to your podcasts!
how can you ever be negative about david gosh
will may just be a realer asian than david and ryan
The use of the animal I think is what determined people whether they kill it for meat or not. Dogs serve as protection to your home, they can be trained much easier than other animals like wolves (relation to your wolf-dog argument).

We may get milk from cows but we still kill them at the end when they can no longer provide milk or even whenever because of the larger quantity of meat you can get from it. We don't eat cats even though they breed like chicken (I mean they pop kits a lot) because back then they helped with the pest control (rodents, cockroaches...Etc.)

Though the most important thing ii got from the video is knowing that David is a can of balls.
There’s a difference between hating and sharing your opinion
Dear Ryan,

Sir! The Nine-year-old Army is calling for your assistance and help! Please direct your attention to the PEWDIEPIE vs T-Series sub count. As of now, it is most likely that T-Series will be the first to 100M, but we can prevent that if you promote Pewdiepie in a livestream directly on YouTube! Pls help us, raise the gap to 500K-1M+ in favor of PDP, and the future of YT!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Sincerely,
                The Nine-year-old Army
Ryan is so well spoken but he should speak his mind more. I feel like he's scared of offending people that's why he explains every single thing. People are going to be offended nonetheless.

Meals on wheels is such a great movie
Some people are too harsh on poor can of balls David
Dear Ryan: Please promote pewdiepiee or do a livestream for him
I watched the previous video with David and I don't find him rude or whatever. I thought that was just how comfortable and close Ryan and David are with each other. And for your sake David, You are a can of balls.
Get pop filters!
I like David he's a can of purple elephant balls :D wink wink
David s a canon ball
I hate when people say "humanely euthanize" animals. It doesn't matter how you kill the animal, you are killing an animal. Whenever dog fighters or rooster fighters get caught doing those illegal acts, the animal organization comes and kills the victims, the animals. I dont agree with that. That's stupid
David is a can of balls, not to be confused with cannibal!!
Ryan Higa are you in bts
I have pet fish and I always feel guilty whenever I eat fish, too. It's a hate-love relationship. Like I'll go to an aquarium and be like "oh man these fish are so majestic and beautiful!... and delicious" and it's very confusing for me...
David didnt even seem mean to me....I was surprised when y'all said he got mean comments. That being said, David is a can of balls :)
People would not starve if meat was not an option.  It takes 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline to produce one pound of beef.  If all those resources were used to grow plants for human consumption it would yield much more edible product.  Animal proteins are not as effectively utilized in the human body as plant proteins.  The latest medical research links animal protein to heart disease, osteoporosis, cancer and diabetes.  Not even addressing the ethical and environmental issues, the bottom line is that there would be much more food available if we stopped eating animal products.  People would be healthier, and the medical and pharmaceutical industries would lose money.  In order to keep unethical institutions rich, we are all indoctrinated into believing that killing and eating the flesh of other sentient life is normal and necessary.
conspiracy theories are super cool topics. please continue them
Dear Ryan, do the Matrix but all the characters are and on phones all the time
"David is a can of balls"
🤔🤔🤔😆
QUESTION: what is your guys’ thoughts on fan accounts? Do you ever support them? Have boundaries for them? 
🤔🤔🤔🤔
Day-vidde is a cann of bawls
Maaaan.. that David is a can of balls ;)
Will there ever be another Cooking, but Not Really?
DAVID IS A CANNON BALL OR DAVID IS A CAN OF BALLS
Pls make a livestream for Felix/Pewdiepie
David is a can of balls 



Sorry im abit late
(Dear Ryan) could  you spin on a chair as fast as you can
Dear happy Ryan, can you play a game without touching a mobile
Yeees, I live in a super-cold place, and my mom and I dream of moving to someplace hot. Our summer is short, which makes it even more precious. Even rain is welcome, because that means it's too warm for snow lol
Off the pill 


Me: hear hear 

Mom: watching drug
rYAN HIGA IS A TRUE NIGA
Jackie Chan newwwwbz
David is a Cannibal in the comments
Cannibalism is desecration of a corpse
David is a CAN OF BALLS
hey ryan, it's true, singaporeans do love the cold. in 16 years of life i haven't seen snow BUT i truly appreciated the 5-10 degree celsius weather on my long visit to ireland. my skin loved the lack of humidity and visibly smoothened out and cleared up. it was the best month of my life and i didn't use moisturiser at all
69 dislikes coz it's paco and his 69 other accounts
dear Ryan can you do card throwing trickshots if not thats ok
I love Will for knowing the Jackie Chan movies. Shame on Ryan and David for not knowing!! Rumble in the Bronx is one of the best JC movies. Also, Jackie Chan put out a letter that there isn't a 4th Rush Hour movie coming out.
About the eating meat part: 


I'm vegan and personally I don't judge people for eating meat or animal products. But what I do judge a lot of people who eat meat for is the fact that they don't respect meat, or the animals that gave it to them. All over the internet there are memes about animals being slaughtered as if it was a lighthearted, hilarious thing, and all over the internet, people are saying that being vegan is stupid and ridiculous. (And I get a lot of them are saying that because some vegans are really extreme and judgmental, but that doesn't make their cause stupid). I've even seen some messed up video called "Vegetables vs burger", and it was just some kid throwing vegetables at a cow. I know it was supposed to be funny, and people did find it funny because it was the definition of internet humor, but I just thought "Dude, you just threw things at an animal that was just peacefully going on about its day and who is literally gonna  so you can have food, how can that be funny in any way?" (Sad part is, you count as a "triggered vegan" if you dare to criticize things like this). Then there are these edgelords who always brag about "LOL I buy meat every single day just to piss off vegans". Like...congrats, you're a sadist. That's why I'm glad that Ryan at least acknowledges that the meat industry is a terrible thing, and that he's at least thinking about this stuff instead of mindlessly consuming his food.


I'm fine with people eating meat as long as they don't buy cheap meat, don't eat it every day, and at least  that it was once a living creature instead of wasting it and playing with it and making fun of cows, pigs and chickens. These three animals should be  in our society for everything they do for us. But no, we throw stuff at them and make memes about them being killed and eaten. This is just what pisses me personally off so much.
Please make how to be emo 2.0
Dear Ryan, you should look into Halal food. You can eat meat but the animal has to be raised in a good environment and they should be killed in the same way so they could die quickly and they don’t have to suffer. There are other requirements for Halal foods as well, so if you want to be cautious about the meat you are eating Halal food is a good option.
David is cannon ballls
Not speaking for everyone here (and I didn't leave a comment on the last video with David) David did look pretty annoying on the last video not because of his views on certain subjects, but because he seemed to constantly talk over everyone that disagreed with him. Sure this should a place where they can talk about whatever but it's hard to talk to someone that doesn't seem to want to listen in return. It was his first time being in Ryan's podcast and I think the comments really made him take a step back. He approached this video a different way while still expressing himself in an effective manner. You may not need to read this but I just want David to know he's doing a better job.
Actually Ryan, if you look more into it, people wouldn’t starve if we stopped eating meat. I’m not super knowledgeable on this and you can do your own research, but many people actually go plant based to help solve world hunger. This is because it takes so many resources to raise animals for meat, as we have to grow food for the animals we eat as well. The amount of plants and grains it takes to produce meat to feed one person we can actually use to feed 10 people or something like that. If we used the land and resources to grow food for humans rather than to raise farm animals, we would be able to feed way more people
DAVID IS A CANNON BALL
YES. WE HATE IT.
Re: vegan section, when Ryan says ‘we need it to survive, there are already people starving’ well no. There is enough food to stop hunger, it’s the distribution of it that’s the problem. And food is in fact being wasted on cows when the masses of wheat would be used for humans.
David is a can of balls, and don't mind the ending part
ryan should make a conspiracy theory video proving that aliens are just evolved humans
Dear Ryan can you make a full music video with alanwalker
He made chili out of his foot and didn't tell them
Are the BgA band gonna be back?
Anyone else want them to make new songs and bring back the Boys generally Asian back?
David is a can of balls 😂
David better not interrupt again.
David is the biggest can of balls
David is a canon balls? 😂😂😂
not everything people do is for themselves, thats projecting.  parents do things for their kids not for themselves, but for the kids.  "but its THEIR kids" ya well what about foster parents? they legit care about other people.
I just have one thing to say... Fish is meat haha
Dear Higa, it would be really nice of you to make a live stream to promote Felix. Your action will be remembered in the great sub war. As now, T-Series just passed Pewd today, and now it's leading with nearly 100k sub gap. We need your help. Thanks very much!
anyone else miss i dare you and parkourse?
Well fish dont feel pain so i think thats the reason.
WhEres mY weekLy doSe of PaCo?!
Waiting for Derek and Daina
please make a livestream for Felix/Pewdiepie
What a bunch of cans of balls ... no its only u david xD xD i loved it guys but paco is sth else.. have him all the time.. 💙💙
why is it called shi shi break?
RYAN, HAVE HAPPYSLIP AND DAVID CHOI IN A PODCAST!!!! HAHAHAHA MAKE DAVID CHOI SMILEEE
I don't mind if people eat any kind of animal, it's the way they're treating these animals before eating that makes me hate and judge people. In western countries cows, pigs, any animal that's been eaten are held in conditions contemptuous of life. And so are animals in eastern countries. That is what needs to be questioned and changed, not the kind of animal we are eating.
Hate comments are the one thing you'll get the most of, if you like anything at all
Dear Ryan can you do a sad story about a teddy
Why u have n-Word in your name?
What are fans of Ryan called????
Dear Ryan can u do a ric flair drip parody in a Persian accent
Please make a livestream for PewDiePie. T Series is in the lead and you may be our only hope to get PewDiePie back to number 1.
The one time I leave a viewer question for the last video released relevant to that video, and then there's no questions this video...😥
I'm from Minnesota and I think it's safe to assume that almost everybody in the state does NOT appreciate the warmth like Ryan does the cold. Minnesota gets freezing in the winter and very humid and hot in the summer. It's more like we miss summer during the winter and then vice versa because of the drastic temperatures.
Man, David is such a can of balls!
a boing uhh uhh a boing ...a boing
lol jk no hate
These podcasts are already pretty educational with the way in which you guys try to explore both sides of your themes, like with the consumption of meat. Would be perfect if maybe a bit more research was done prior (For instance, studies have shown that there would still be more than enough food for everyone even if the farming of animals stopped, because the lands used to farm animals would be used for crops) . But you also said at the very beginning that these podcasts are unscripted, and they are definitely still entertaining and the best way to end the week :D
Vegas has underground rivers which is where they get water.
David is a can of balls?😂
Ryan not leaving the house, wanting to crash planes and not even watching drunken  master omg... I’m sending prayers and Mercury is only bad in some fish. Just do research 👌🏻 I love reptiles 😭🐸🐍🦎 plus that ending bit gives the hebie jebie feels
Hi! Could you promote Pewdiepie? We can’t have corporate channels take over YouTube as they are now. Censorship is already starting with Pewdiepie’s music videos being blocked in India
Dear Ryan, Can you do higher "Hee hee" than the Ayuwoki who does higher "Hee hee" than Sean's "Teehee"?
the only thing i learned in this is that david choi may or may not possibly be a cannibal
Yes! DAVID!
Oh crap i missed another video
AHHHHHH IM EARLY SAY SOMETHING FUNNY 
the amount of depression I have
the shi shi break song is too loud
aww i feel bad for david. i honestly didnt know, i really liked him. it was an interesting discussion cuz it also felt real. just listening to friends discussing a subject, isnt that the concept of this podcast? people be getting butthurt smh... I actually tought this audience would be more mature
David is a CAN OF BALLS. LOL!
So many crops are grown to feed the meat industry, enough to stop world hunger if the meat industry ended
Make a livestream for Pewdiepie to STOP T-Series
Humans dont eat cats and dogs because we have a problem of seeing smaller things than us on every regular basis and making it join our pack. Like people dont wanna replace roombas because it's a part of the family
David is a Can-of-balls
Homo sapiens developed arrows and throwing Spears, where Neanderthals only used close range weapons, which allowed homosapiens to not risk their lives while hunting and not work as hard. Basically, working smart will get you ahead of the curb
I’m not tryna troll but y’all are kinda to serious. Like if one of y’all throws a simple light hearted joke, the others jump on their case, like I know it’s a serious podcast but chill a bit. Love yah btw, this is not a troll

David is a can-of-balls
From Hawaii and its insane to us to not wear a jacket under 70 degrees F
I'm from Singapore and love the cold and hate the heat! I think we have a higher tolerance to cold as well, my husband's from Korea where there's really harsh winters and he keeps complaining that its cold here cos of all the air-conditioning, and looooves the heat here haha. But I find that Singaporeans do tend to over-dress when they go to winter countries and bundle up a lot - they can literally wear 5 layers or even more when they visit countries like Korea in winter, whilst most Koreans just wear like 2/3 layers.
If this is grey your a t series supporter

David is a can-of-balls
Unpopular opinion if you want to eat meat you need a licence which requires you to kill and skin an animal and eat it and also spend a day in a slaughterhouse because the privilege of eating meat should be taken seriously if you are unable to kill for your food and understand where the food comes from you shouldn't be able to eat meat.
I know it's not going to be a popular opinion and I genuinely don't want to come off as another complaining person on the internet thinking they have the solution but it just an idea and am genuinely interested in what other people think on the topic as well because I do eat meat and have killed and skinned an animal and then cooked and ate it and I think people should understand what they're eating actually is.
So ye feel free to tell me what you think because this is a topic that needs to be discussed.
dear ryan can you rap the fast verse on rap god by eminem?
David is a can of balls and the podcast was still great without Paco which does not make him any less superb as a moderator but I always thought good of him to start with

Dear Ryan, can you do a skit of a dog's life with Marley and Teddy the Corgi?
I think dogs started being visualized as pets by the native Americans. Since the men had to leave and hunt they would leave the wolves with their families as protection. I’m not even sure where I read that 😅I could totally be wrong
You’re more likely to crash in a car then a plane
yes we do hate that part
David's a cannibal in the comments
Dear Ryan can you please bring back arden to the podcast and tell us the steak story
The way I see it, there's no "right way" to kill a living being who doesn't want to die.  Veganism benefits our health, the environment, and the wellbeing of animals.  I appreciate that Ryan has looked into the realities of animal slaughter.  I hope this gets others to become interested in looking into the reasoning behind veganism so that they can make more educated decisions.
David is a cannon ball
You should make a parody of old Town Road

what happened to marley?
I'm not a vegan, but similarly to Ryan I get a lot of what they are saying. And I just want to say, It's not true that we would starve if we would stop eating animals, actually the opposite is true, if we ate all the staff we feed the animals, we would have a lot more food.
well, david is a can of balls
Feeling uncomfortable listening to this while eating my salmon lunch. Lolz

That’s the same for Singaporeans!!! It’s hot 365days so we love the cold!!
Love the podcasts!
Well .....in Syria because of war some regions have no food left so they had to eat cats to survive
I would say we don't eat cats, dogs, etc because they're omnivores/carnivores and we get less nutrients from things that eat meat.
Ninja Melk spotted!

how does he look the same after 6 years?
Even if you guys are not educating people per se, you raise interesting topics, food for thought, and share your opinions. Sometimes, it is even more valuable, because it makes people think for themselves

Please talk more about sapiens, it was really interesting
Can it, david!

So basicly the new software was to keep the plane from stalling. It is supposted to happen when the plane changes from going upwards to going forwards but in these 2 cases it kicked in when the plane was already horizontal causing the plane to nosedive. I hope i explained good enough (i am no expert my dad is a plane engineer and we had a conversation about it).
You should do a colab with pew die pie?!

I like the noises at the end because David is a can of balls.
Will is so woke when it comes to animal rights and reducing his plastic use.
Meme review! 👏
There is no humane way to murder a living being that doesn't want to die. Be consistent with your beliefs in that it is either ok to murder all or it is not ok to murder anyone. If you discriminate, explain why. Through the eyes of a pig/chicken/fish/cow etc. They want to live as much as a Cat/dog/horse. We shouldn't be playing God with their lives.
Yeah stop the breqthing into Mic thing
I'm from Singapore and I didn't grew up with ac. Not all Singaporeans are richhhh :(

Ryan next time please when it comes to sensitive topic like cannibalism eating cats or dogs can u include a warning please
I chose the best episode the listen to on a plane...
Honestly David don’t feel bad about talking over people because I do it too and don’t even realize it so no worries fren.
fish dont feel pain though they are flopping around due to their survival instinct not cuz it hurts
David is can of balls :)
i care about fish just as much as other animals. they feel.  they also make noises,  it sounds like dolphins clicking.
David is a can of balls amirite fellas?
Dear ryan I can't find teehee app
Are there time constraints to the podcast? Ryan seemed a little focused on the time today.. maybe he really was just anticipating watching his grand-fishies birth.. Anyways I still love it! <3
Hey everyone eat won ton soup ok
Speaking as a Singaporean, I do enjoy going to air-conditioned areas and cooler countries. My family isn't rich so even though we have an old ac unit (from previous owner), we don't use it often unless it's SUPER, SUPER hot because of the higher electricity bills that will come later. So it kinda boggles me to see foreigners come to our country and suntan on the hottest days of the year... because I'll be in the shade like byeeeeeeeeeeeee. ~__~
People usually never ate wolves, because most likely the wolves would kill the human first if the humans tried, also wolves helped cave men hunt.
Watching this video with my cat right beside me.Super glad he can't understand enough English rn
To Will, even though we've spent so much time with dogs and cats, we've spent more time with horse. For centuries, horses were humans main transportation and were the most helpful to humankind but does that mean humans won't eat them? No.
LOL he looks like David So
36:16
I think we dont eat specific animals because of the composition of their meats...like for example rabbit meats are too high in protein or something that it'd be dangerous to consume a great amount of it like that of a cow's meat or something
David can’t be the only troll since you’re all trolls.

Dear Ryan Can You Do Card trickshots
wtf just before watching this video i was reading a post on reddit abt the guy that ate his foot, he's still actively commenting and stuff, he made tacos and ate it with his friends because his friends were saying that they'd try human flesh if it was made ethically, he got into a motor cycle accident and took the opportunity to do so, he said it was delicious, tasted "like buffalo, but chewier. Super beefy and little fat." really cool dude.
We eat mostly what we domesticate, what can be "produced" in large quantities. Hunting, although an option for some, is not sustainable. There are several reasons why only certain animals are domesticated. Cows, goats, sheep can live in herds, and they follow one leader, which can be a human. They are not all alphas. Domestication of zebras, etc was also attempted, but did not work. Zebras are skittish, they are afraid of us, the same way they are afraid of lions, so they immediately run away. Sheep, cows, goats are docile, calm. Also sustaining those animals should be easily available and cheap. But from moral perspective, it's strange. People would consider some animals parts of their family, while eating others. Humans are good at justifying their actions, I guess. Personally, I am uneasy at the thought of tons of meat at a meat store, let alone killing the animal in the first place. Doesn't seem right
Dear Ryan can you do a nerf war video?

I think it’s more we all learn so much but we don’t retain it, it’s just entertaining to have in the background or in front of you or at least personally

I was actually saying David is in town David is in town hope he isnt on a podcast, and here he is. He was well behaved though. What a can-o-balls. Dont eat me
its more likely we are the amalgamation of all former hominids. we ended up with the best parts of of thousands of years of each hominids evolution.  its unlikely one species evolves all the things we are today, its much easier for individual species to evolve something kick ass(like a kick ass immune system) and then(unintentionally) breed that trait into another species which also had a bad ass trait(big smart brain) so you end up with one species that like has 2 badass traits that would have normally taken twice as long to evolve on their own, but 'we' got a  by interbreeding with other species. we dont share all of our dna with early humans, we just call early humans 'early humans' cause we share more dna with them than other hominids.  early humans just coincidentally(maybe its not a coincidence, but it wasnt intentional) ended up giving us more dna than the rest.(i think early humans gave us a ridiculous sex drive, maybe big brain but thats debatable lol) i heard somewhere they think that early humans were very social so that could have made early humans natural leaders (compared to the rest of the hominids)so its not surprising if early humans took charge and went out of their way to be social(consequence of that is bow-chicka-wow-wow) with other hominids where other hominids couldnt get along with other different hominids but early humans were able bridge that gap(hence more of early human dna).  humans actually get along very well with each other compared to all other animals.  u stick a bunch of humans in a room and everything is pretty much ok, u stick a bunch of chimps in a room and it will be a blood bath.
David is a can of balls :)
David is a can of balls😆😆
Can you please go back to the skits and dear ryans? No offense, but these are boring...
actually, if we ate no animal products, the beans and lentils we fed to cattle would feed everyone since humans eat less. of course, that's impossible, but it still is true that if no animals were grown as food, we would not have world hunger. i definitely agree, though, i wish i were capable of being vegan, but i'm too selfish to do that no matter how much i know it is bad.
David is a can of bowls :P
You know I watched a video about how many reptiles actually lack the ability to show compassion to humans. It's why we don't domesticate them and they are considered exotic pets. They lack a part in their brains that would enable them to make a connection with us. idk this is off of what I remember but just an interesting thought coz a pet iguana would be pretty cool.

David is a cannibals
Yes yes yes yes yes yes wait is it because
On the topic of meat, not to throw any shade, taking away most production of meat would not cause hunger it is the other way around. Meat takes a lot of resources to produce Beef:1800 gallons of water/pound, they eat half of our grains and burp out Methane (CH4) and there poop emits it two which contributes to 19% of global warming.
David is a can of balls :)))
It takes more to raise an animal than to farm for crops. Because raising animals still requires growing crops and feeding those animals.

go vegan!
Comparing non-veganism to survival situations isn't right because you wouldn't use that justification for stealing for example which would also happen in survival situations. Also comparing the past to look at our morals today is wrong because our society's have been built on a past of murder but you wouldn't use the past to justify murder of humans.. Don't use it for the murder of non human animals
David is a can of cannibal cannonballs
My only thought was is there really a food shortage in american or are people just broke or wasteful? I've seen meat get thrown away in grocery stores.
The Apple guy again? Why?
David is a can of cannonballs
Cows and pigs are domesticated, too. Living as companion animals or not is not the distinction between domesticated or wild. :)
Ryan you’re spreading misinformation. The new Boeing 737 MAX is the one that crashed twice. . Not the old Boeing 737 (the one most airlines fly). The US has grounded all MAX jets. They aren’t in use. Stop spreading fear. Lots of people are afraid of flying.
Dear Ryan, can you make a how to make a small budget horror movie

:))....for the last goddam time :)) the world heath organisation has deemed a vegan diet a perfectly sound healthy diet for all stages of life. There is more than enough no-bias scientifically backed research on this subject. No one can say there is not enough research on it, because there is a ridiculous amount, people just don't want to admit it. Sure there is no way if you're not interested on the subject that you actually know this, but this is not a trend. I get that Joe Roegan is very persuasive and cool to look up to, but Joe usually doesn't invite on his cool podcast people who disagree with his premise, that people will die without meat, or that keto is the way of real life and men. He invited a researcher on the high carb end of the spectrum and he almost didn't let him talk (not joe specifically but Gary?whatever that guy\s name is). The biggest health initiative in the wold already released a statement that veganism is safe and you can survive on it as well as any form of organic/bio/fancy/whatever kind of meat you wanna eat is all cancerous. This is not my opinion, the internet is free, go google the world health organisation. As long as you meet your nutritional targets they can be from whatever source you want. 
Whatever your opinion is on the subject, make no mistake, there is no nutritional benefit or need for humans to consume meat and/or animal products in general, it's just because you want to. Do it, don't do it, it's up to you. But everyone should have basic information.

I think the reason most people dont care as much for the life of fish is because the brain of the fish is not big enough for it to have its own consciousness, they are quite literally mindless. (I think thats it, im just typing this off of what i know)
david is such a troll
David is can of balls
Who is still loyal to this channel?
About eating cats and dogs being a cultural thing. I think it's more geographical and historical. Because cultures that eat strange stuff like insects, or cats and dogs, at some point in history did not have any alternatives. Just another way of adapting and surviving)
David really can be a can of balls
David is a can of balls haha
David is fun, the annoying thing about the iPhone podcast was that he was not really giving us real reasons why Apple is better than Android but was very snobish about it like brand fetishism which is okay just don't try to make it look more than it is. On the other hand I accept his stance regarding computers, but with the phones you can get way better Android stuff for the price of an iPhone if you are willing to let go your brand loyalty.

Im from Playa del Carmen, not Hawaii, but well guess we have a climate thats almost the same. And yeah i totally hate the cold haha specially cause i got used to heat. But a lot of friends simply hate it because is what we have basically the whole year, and they love the couple of cold weeks we get once a year.
due to to the amount of food consumed by animal, if no animals wear "farmed" their would be too much food
What if Ryan died tho,
David is a can of balls
David is a can of balls :D
I agree. I think as we go up on Maslow's Hierarchy of needs we have more privilege to decide the things we want to stand for and fight for because at the top is self actualization. And in one way or another maybe most of this call on being a vegetarian comes from a place where they have the privilege to think about that as their way of self actualization. (Except of course for certain religions) but in a lot of countries where sometimes all they literally have is dust to eat--meaning they arent even stable on the bottom of the pyramid in terms of basic needs, it's difficult to tell them they are wrong for hoping to eat meat.

It was a Boeing 737max and they were new planes. The crashes happened because of the software but it was also because the pilots were not trained in what to do if the plane started acting weird. The crash happened during take off not in the middle of the flight.

Cannibalism is illegal in almost every country, unless in a genuine survival situation and the body is dead, I’m pretty sure. Like with that soccer team that crashed in some mountain range. Some dude wanted to see what humans tasted most like at some university, but the university and police said it was illegal, so he made a food synthesizer machine where it would replicate something put into it and discovered humans taste like veal. Also I’m a David sympathizer, gotta survive my dude

Most logically wouldn’t you eat cows and pigs because they have way more meat on they aren’t predatory animals so they’re easier to domesticate and breed(during the agricultural revolution I mean)
Aw y’all gave Paco some love 😄
Why do people pick on david? He s so niceee
i miss paco.
But fish is meat
Pls make a stream for pewdiepie
Well I'm on the pill while watcing this... Is this comment used too much?
wait no. If you stopped the slaughterhouses it would leave so many more resources to be used for food for humans and not food for the cows. World hunger can be solved just with plant-based food. The most effective use of resources is by producing plant-based food.
wat???? people hated on david? dont get it
David is balls in a can.
I don’t agree with peta just sayin ha but animals deserve respect and the only way a killing should happen in this world for an animal or human should be only for self defense thank you for these OTP’s i love em

remind you, my fellow human beings on ryan higa tv; we are humans; we have civilizations, intelligence upon sophistication, innovation upon principles, technology upon engineering, philosophy upon religious beliefs, arts upon architect, so on and so on. we wear clothes and is supposed to mind our hygiene; suppose to conserve; suppose to be sufficient. suppose to own a dog, or a cat, or a fish or domesticate cows, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc. therefore, we are not animals. we are not pets, we are not domesticated livestocks, we are not cavemen, savages, barbarians, hulks, whathavethey on steroids/growth stimulating hormones; we are not androids/robots/machines. this is not a speech. we are watching higa tv from the planet they call 'earth'... flat, round, oval whatever...

When the guppies are born you should separate them from the rest of the bigger fish because fish have no qualms against eating their young.
Btw, if you are concerned with how animals are treated, but you are not willing to give up meat, try halal or kosher. They ensure that animals are kept in good conditions, and killed painlessly

I don't understand the objection most people have to eating certain animals. I am vegetarian because I don't agree with unnecessarily harming any animal but in the same vein I am not more opposed to eating a dolphin than I am a pig.
Why don't we eat dogs and cats? The Bible.

Im not vegan or vegetarian, but we could feed more people if we didn’t raise livestock, because we make more food by giving crops straight to people than to feed animals and getting meat to feed to people.

He only thing I might suggest is maybe adding a disclaimer to the beginning that your opinions are not equal to facts. Most people would understand this, but since a lot of the topics are not researched before hand, it becomes a bit.... irresponsible? to not clarify that none of what you guys believe or say is absolutely true....does that make sense? No hate at all whatsoever. Love the podcast =]
David is a can of ⚽️🏀🏈⚾️🏐🎾
Willful ignorance. Don't turn your back on who need your help the most. Just because you turn your back doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If you needed help you wouldn't want people turning their back. As a human you have moral agency and we have an obligation to fight for what's right
Me acuerdo cuando este canal iba primero en youtube
Dear Ryan Marley stole your car

If you were stranded on an island, with nothing to eat, except for a fresh, tasty, scrumptious, recently dead piece of human body. And you were gonna die, I think a number of people/ most people would eat it rather than die. I think given the situation, we'd do anything. Like in a zombie apocalypse, you might just eat people since the law probably has no power by that point. Granted, you'd eat other preserved food first or hunt for animals, but still.
Cannabidiolism is not illegal as long as its consensual lol
Eating meat eating animals is not good that's why

Dear Ryan, can you do another lit trick shot video?
DUDE SAID HE WOULD EAT DOG WTF

Dear Ryan, can you bring Helga back?
David is a can of balls eating purple elephants...
Or try hulu
David is a can of balls 😂😂 that’s terrible guys. I liked purple elephants better. Haha
Isn't fish meat?
Here’s the problem with these new off the pill videos compared to the older ones. All this is is you sitting and talking for an hour about random crap. When there is a topic I want to find it’s pretty much impossible to sift through the video. The old ones back in 2009 were funny and quick. Even the Non Binary babies video was interesting, because it was edited and far shorter and fun to watch.
Dear ryan, can you remake Old Town Road mv ?
One of my old friends in high school once said the VanossGaming is better than NigaHiga. What do you think?
Like = NigaHiga
Comment = VanossGaming
I dare you
I don’t want to come across as one of those annoying vegans, but we could actually end starvation if we all stopped eating meat all-together because the animals consume so many grains that we could feed humans with instead. Think about how much space meat production takes up since it is not only the slaughterhouses and farms but also the fields with food for the animals
Dear Ryan can you jump on a trampoline filled with Legos for 5 seconds
Dear Ryan,what if we stop itching?
we dont eat cats and dogs cause they wernt bred for taste, they were bred for looks and use(cats eat mice, mice carry disease, dogs help with hunting and they both help with love<3).  cows, pigs, and chicken tho....they have one purpose.  which is kinda funny cause if vegans had their way, cows pigs and chickens would go extinct cause they would have no use anymore and they cant survive in the wild on their own so they just go extinct cause no one wants to keep them as pets...maybe chickens cause they are small and maybe pigs cause of fertilizer and they eat scraps, but cows are just too big and expensive.
Dear ryan, why is your youtube name NIGA HIGA
Hi
Dear ryan answer this dear ryan
Cannonballs, purple elephants
Hey, I noticed that you mentioned the number of hate comments you have gotten, but at the same time as David points out that since your audience is that much big and you have received much more great comments by proportion, I don't know why you even bother about hate comments. I or any person with sane mind would not see any negative thing in you. So I wonder why you even consider comments from people who do not even seem to be in right mind.
Dear Ryan can you go and meet sean
Singaporeans and Malaysians are with you Ryan. It's bloody hot here.
I ate a dog and I'm Asian. TASTY!!!
I’m from the Middle East and it’s always hot we have ACs every where thou and now I’m in the UK studying and I don’t like the cold although I thought I would prefer it to the hot weather, there are 3 people from Singapore studying with me 2 don’t like the cold and 1 loves it
Please educate yourself on veganism guys. Maybe have someone like James Aspey or Eathling Ed be a part of your podcast because you guys are really making it seem like veganism is something that’s irrelevant. The truth is that veganism is the future and the movement is growing faster than ever. I used to make fun of vegans, I used to think that it wasn’t possible but there’s so much more to it and you guys are just gonna look back at this video and cringe on how ignorant you guys sound.
David is a can of bawls

Dear Ryan, you make a Call of Duty movie fake trailer?
dear ryan pleas make a stunt video
Why is his name niga higa?

STOP WHAT YOUR DOING AND WATCH RUMBLE IN THE BRONX! One of the BESTTT Jackie Chan movies!!!
Please do a livestream promoting PewDiePie.
Can of ballzzzzzzz
Yeah. That makes sense. I mean we do willingly eat abused cows, pigs, and chickens. Why not dogs and cats?
juegagerman is best
Bring back Parcourse!
People don’t eat dogs and cats because they don’t taste nice
dear ryan, can you support pewdie from t series in your place?
Dude, "miniscule"? This meat production industry is ruining the planet. Causing the increase of global warming. Well, i guess it wouldn't matter. In 50 years the earth would be dead
Hey
Dear Ryan, make a parody of Old town road
Fact: Blacks eat cats to. I find it funny that if Asians eat it, the whole world is outraged.  But when blacks are cooking it up and eating it, it's okay.
Wow. No seatgeek? :( wah wah waaa lol
Why is Will so white if you live in the desert?
The reptile thing is also because you can’t communicate much with reptile because their brains aren’t as developed and they don’t feel emotion besides survival instinct, the can’t LIKE or DISLIKE things they just live to live
I’m from the Philippines and I’m now in America, but Ryan is so right. We don’t have ACs in our houses there and it was soooo hot lol
David is a can of balls because I’m a real one
Your vids now are boring as, go back on how you used to make videos

I HATE PODCASTT EGHH
What do you mean he got hate? ...David is so nice, never expected him to get hate
fakesians
We wouldn't starve, actually if we went to a vegan world we already grow enough food to feed 12 billion humans but most of that is fed to livestock who are murdered to feed the rich, world hunger still exists because of non-veganism
Cannonball
Dear ryan- visit to India
This podcast was basically about how humans are the most evil thing that evolved. From using tools to beat an ape to mean comments on YouTube that hurt David's feelings.
-
Dogs are delicious. Google it. It’s all just a culture thing. We no longer need to eat animals to survive. It’s harming our environment, health, and needlessly killing animals.  The life of a cow is no different than a dog.
Dear Ryan,  can you rap an Eminem song
David's a can of ballz! 😜
I got a bacon commercial when I was about half way through
Dear Ryan, can you buy ice cream then return it because it doesn’t have any ice cubes and cream (:
No, I don't like it
woof
Dogs have been used for hunting for a very long time, and cats were used to kill mice to prevent disease (plus they were worshipped by Egyptians). Plus cats and dogs are considered unclean by Hebrews and Muslims, so there's that too.
Whos the fat guy
TEEHEE
Dear Ryan, can you do a Star Wars parody?
isn't the reason we eat cows and pigs is bcuz it's easier to keep them as livestock? easy to breed and they r bigger
I don't think people would starve because of not eating meat. There is already enough food on earth for everyone, I think the problem is that it is not distributed as it should be in a lot of countries. Also A LOT of food is spoiled in western countries
Ancient people would only eat meat of the animals who are herbivores. And it is in most of the religious scriptures that we shall eat only herbivores animals.
bad comment is better than no comment?
Where is paco?
Davidisacanofballs
28:55 It's not necessary in order to keep humans alive. Feeding plants to animals that we eat is inefficient and a waste of plant food and calorie transfer.
Dear Ryan , can you touch your nose with your tougue.
Honestly I think as a Society we need hate comments and bullies(Chris rock actually said this) life has assholes and it’s better to learn to deal with them now then be naive and cry about it later.
Dear  ryan can you prank your freinds like you kidnapped some one
david wasn’t that bad cmon
37:31
Will: system malfunction
David = can of balls.

The outro is like ASMR, which typically is not soothing for me unless it's really goofy.
Can confirm, am from Singapore studying in Cleveland and I love the cold  now
Teach us how to actually edit youtube videos. And what you see when you edit..... also can of balls..... your hair is not as bad as it has looked in the past.   Keep it up (back handed compliment😉)
If you guys wanted you could have a section of the podcasts be a kind of rebuttal of a topic from the previous week but after you have looked it up individually. Like next week having a mini part saying new ideas on eating meat but actually knowing exact facts about it. Or next episode talking more about the aliens are evolved people theory. You could call it the "On the Pill" section or something.


Also David is a can of balls.
When I gotta get on a plane tomorrow 😢







David is a can of balls
The 737 has a serious mechanical issue which they had to have known about. The issue in the airline industry is the manufacturers will not fix an issue until something happens. As for the turbulence, hills/mountains cause major turbulence on the backside depending on the direction of the wind. If the pilot has the correct information on the weather they should know that in advance and be able to avoid that turbulence as it’s only very close to the mountains. If the plane is at least a couple thousand feet above the mountains turbulence due to them is really unlikely. Turbulence could also be due to a cold front rolling in the area if that was the case when you went to Vegas.
I love how Ryan pronounces wolf.
There's nothing as powerful as an ape and smart as a human.... Have you heard of "The Mountain"? Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. Worlds strongest man?
I swear ryan as seen the fish birth before cause I remember seeing it in a bts or something 🤔
Hy plz reply m3 if u r reading dis.
david is a canon ball
Fun fact: only mammals and birds can be trained or domesticated. Reptiles' smaller brains arent "large" enough to have crtical thinking or think into the future so this prevents them from actually "loving" you or showing any real compassion to other species

If animals dont want to be eaten, then why are they made out of food
I always thought we don’t eat cats and dogs because the animals like cows have more meat and more nutrients that we can survive on and they give products like milk that we can make other things with
Dear ryan how to be a beatboxer

I'm from Israel and it's a desert and I also love the cold... Ryan's on to something
I’ve got to say that I used to hate long content because I felt like I was making a commitment by clicking on a video, but I absolutely love these podcasts, keep up the good work Ryan.
Wut...it's great!






( I'm a girl okay)
Please do a off the pill 💊 gaming podcasts please
I like Rumble In the Bronx and Drunken Master more than the Rush Hour series; there's also Meals on Wheels, Who Am I, Mr. Nice guy, etc. I love Rush Hour a lot too but the other two has a certain feel to it that Rush Hour doesn't.
I'm in Singapore and I agree cold is the best thing ever. I sweat under the umbrella while it rains, this place is a freakin microwave!
No Paco?

David's a cannibal
David is so chill, what are you guys talking about?😀
What if we are in a slaughter house for evolved humans a.k.a Aliens.  Dun dun dun
So I was born in India and lived there for 6 years and then I moved to New York and I love the cold and people are like what’s wrong with you but the most interesting part is that my parents for example hate the cold even tho they lived in India for like most of there lives. It’s possible that it’s just their age but it’s possible that the fact that they lived in such heat for so long that they just got used to it and liked it. Like my brother for example was born 5 years before me and the thing is he loves cold too but not to the extent I do. I feel like you like the opposite of what you are used to up until a certain age where the longer they are in the same temperature they like it more
David's a cannibal
David is a can of balls and purple elephants :)
Lol, can of balls
Dear Ryan can you make another Dear Ryan
Make a stream for pewds
Dear Ryan, Can you do a movie of Subway Surfers
Funny and entertaining
The R E A L question should be BgA's new comeback!?!?
damn i’m really loving these podcasts 💜
That Sapien book sounds interesting...  gonna check that out...you all might not be that deep but VERY ENTERTAINING!!!!
David is a can of balls :D
I'm from Minnesota and I love the cold.  I'd rather go to Utah than Florida
I'm so glad someone else knows Rumble in the Bronx!!!! 😀
I think it would be great if you invite regina to do podcast..
First comment!




kidding.
😂 I got an ad about a quarter pounder from McDonald's after they spoke of the vegan stuff
most people in 3rd world countries don't have ac, you guys would be fine.
Will is a true Jackie Chan fan. And David is a can of balls!!!
I love it when David is in the Podcast. He's funny. I don't get the hate about this. :c
The reason we don't eat cats and dogs is because our relationship when we started domestication was different. At the beginning we gave them food and they protected us at night and helped us hunt.
I like David :)
Don’t want to be that guy, but David is a can of balls
We dont eat cats and dogs because of prion desise,.nothing to do with anything else
David is a can of balllsssssss
Ryan gets hate? Dudes the only YouTube to not be on any drama😂😂even pewds can't do that
I agree with veganism in respect to sustainability, rather than morality.
DEAR RYAN
can you please start making dear ryan videos again. Its just a request
I’m about to have 6 flights...



Aaaaaghhhhhhhh. Now I’m freaking out !!!!
Paco is not here? Unstanning 







Lol jk
That was pretty cannon-ballistic of you, David.
All of that about the 'humanity of killing an animal' and everything? So on point. I totally studied that shit, and the screaming thing - but mostly just how much it looks like a person (i.e. that it's relatable) - makes a HUGE difference.

It's like having pets at all: the more it looks like a baby person, the more 'attractive' people find it as company. It's kind of why people like fluffy mammals more. All about that relatability, which is kind of messed up when you think about it.
It actually happened about 2 years after the first plane crash
I've heard that aliens are future humans theory and have added to it. I would tell you right noe but I'm too lazy to type it all out but it really is interesting and makes sense
David is a can of balls and (purple elephants?)
Will had  lot of Julien vibes today xD Also, David is a can of balls xD
45:33 I kind of relate to since I currently lived in Canada and I grew up in the Philippines. I love the cold weather here in Canada, despite me being raised in the Philippines. Mind you in the Philippines it is really hot over there and some people do have an AC but my family is not one of the fortunate ones that owns one. Imagine this you just came out of bathroom, and done taking a bath, you are already sweating that is how hot in the Philippines. Heck, I would even find a way to go to a mall after school, just to chill out. So I appreciate the cold here in Canada.
When people were saying they wanted more off the pill , I think this is a little to much .
Love the podcast it’s great
Yeah, I hate the breathing outro. It's like ASMR and I'm one of those people that it makes physically cringe and feel weird.
get derrick on this and talk about aliens
Yo will looks so pale😂
Soooo true. Singapore is so hot
Love the breathing thing
DAVID THE CANNED NIPPLE
It's cux fish has their eyes on the sides of the head and not the front
There’s no reason we eat one and not the other. It’s cultural. Like Will said, cows and all other animals can be just as loving as our companion animals. I know people who have pigs as pets. There is no difference. If you wouldn’t eat a dog, how can you justify continuing to eat other animals?
PEOPLE WOULDN'T STARVE! Do you know how much crops animals eat? A lot. If that was all turned into food for humans, there'd be easily enough to feed 10 Billion people (there's a study on that somewhere). So if anything, animal farming only increases food shortage. There is a reason that meat used to be a luxury product and still is in poor regions.
Please support pewds
I love when David's in town!👏💕
I love these podcasts and I'm so glad to see David back!! Y'all rock!
do people really think about who they would want like "on their team" when they board a flight? lol thats kinda cool I dont do that. I guess I always thought I would pick my mom
Ending is subpar, but unique.
David is a CanofBalls. also this is the only podcast I listen to weekly every time it comes out cause you guys go through so many daily questions so naturally.
I learn from these podcasts. I learn about you guys and your personalitys and how I would confront people with your prospective cuz I have some of the same ideas as you guys.
Purple elephants, wait David is a can of balls
david sweetie I don't think its normal to think about who you would eat first if a plane crashes
Come to Canada if you love the cold
yes change ending
Oh I knew that there is a missing link between neanderthal and homo sapiens. There is where we can combine the theory of evolution and theory of creation--you know the Big Guy create more advance human on the earth. That's what I thought before. Now that I think of it again, it could be an alien invasion. I like this theory.
Lol when you’re commet has tearible gramer and spelling and noone understand what you saying
what... i dont like apple funboys, but i didnt see anything wrong with that podcast.... people are getting butthurt too much nowadays....
David is a can of bottles.
Hi paco
Actually, as someone who got a degree in agriculture, the farmers do their best to minimize the pain of killing the cows, pigs, chickens, etc. There are actually very extremely strict guidelines regarding the killing of farm animals. And the animals are perfectly fine with being in those cages. The people's "common view" of slaughterhouses is very.... overdone (can't think of the right word). The cases that most vegans argue against slaughterhouses show the absolute worst case scenario.
Lions don't have factory animal farm, they only kill ither animsls when hungry and thet do quickly without toturing them.  It's not natural to breed billions of innocent animals only to kill and place in a plastic wrap (most of them are killed at young age. Yes people are eating babies).  Please watch Earthlings, Dominion on YouTube.  Unfortunately more farm animals are killed in U.S. and Australia due to high meat consumption and supply and demand.  Watch "What the Health " and Forks over knives on Netflix.   The world's healthiest diet is whole food plant based.  So many delicious healthy vegan foods available.
NO! eating meat is contributing to world hunger! we burn down HUUUGE parts of the rainforest to grow crops for cattles and the under privileged people can‘t get amy of the sanitary and good meat. they‘re only for the industrial countries. we sell ROTTEN meat to african and south asian countries because it is cheaper to export our waste. so in those poor countries, people are catching really bad diseases and they don‘t have available health care. So instead of growing the plants for the animals, we could stop or at least reduce world hunger. but yeah keep on being naive. the ignorance is going to make us extinct.
PLEASE help pewdiepie
We eat cows, pigs, chicken and other animals as long as they are mass-produced for consumption. We don't eat cats and dogs since they are not bred to for human consumption. And that is why we have barns, poultry, pens and such since there certain animals are raised to become a food for a human, not because they are cute or cuddly or something. With that analogy, if we mass produce cats and dogs for the sake of convenience, then it will become another type of meat available in the market.
david is a can of balls! 
QUESTION 1: do you believe in the parallel universe theory?
QUESTION 2: how does one make a close group of friends like RHPC + david?
also, the eating animals part of this podcast reminds me of the anime yakusoku no neverland and can't wait for the next podcast about aliens!! :)
on the tempature subject, i can confirm, i'm from iceland and i really love the heat
David is a can of balls. Also, I love when David comes on the podcasts. The conversations they have when David is on is very interesting.
we've got two uploads this week. is this real?
Thank you, Ryan, Will, and David! I just finished reading a book and looking for something else to read. I've been wanting to read "Sapiens" for a while, so that's what my next book will be!
For the mikes' sakes, how about bringing the mike-breathing to an end? If the moisture is bad for them, that is...☺️
Bring David back! Or dont!?
David: y’all watched “The 100”?
David is a can of balls, but he's also funny and chill so you guys should leave him alone

49:45 - 50:00
Ryan's spot on with the warmth cold thing. I'm from new England and I hate winter with a passion. Also as a huge Jackie chan fan myself I would say my favorite movie by him is police story highly reccomend it if you haven't seen it Will
David sucks why is he on the podcast smh
Dear Ryan when are you doing a Dear Ryan video

WE NEED YOUR HELP RYAN IF DO YOUR PART AND HELP PEWDIEPIE!!
sees hate comments
Me: Ignore them Ryan....

You nice....keep going
I hate hate comments that hate on vids i dont hate cuz then i hate them for hating
Just to clarify the information about the Boeing 737 crash issues, the problem is indeed in the software. Because they designed the airplane to use an oversized engine, the margin of the angle of attack that the plane can handle without going out of control is smaller. The reason they did this was to compete with other airplane such as Airbus's newer models. It makes the plane more fuel efficient, and thus more environmentally friendly. To make the new plane handle similar to Boeing's older plane models, a software system was developed to help the pilots adjust the plane so it doesn't go out of control. I don't remember how exactly it determines when to adjust the plane, but I believe the issue is that once the system starts taking over, it locks out the pilots from manually overriding the system. Even after the system corrects the orientation of the plane, it continues to adjust itself, overcorrecting due to the the system continuing to read faulty sensor inputs (as you said). Just wanted to contribute what I know about the situation. If anyone knows more about this and sees anything wrong with what I said, please do correct me.
Canabalism is not illegal 
But it is illegal to kill steal grave rob or whatever way you use to get human flesh in the first place
I'll be flying tomorrow and I'm preparing for my medschool graduation. Thanks guys. Oh I always think I'm going to crash on every flight, and sometimes I put my ID in my pocket so people will be able to identify my body. Insane or smart? You choose
it wasnt all boeing 737's but these specific ones had a new system that the pilots werent familiar with... the nose of the plane kept going downwards and that was the main issue from what i have understood
Dear Ryan can you do a parody of old time road plz
Can you guys talk about failures, disappointing people and yourself. how you handle this
David is a can of balls. Lol
We just had a class on the issue of slaughter houses. One of the students grew up on a ranch where they slaughtered animals, but they gave the animals a lot of room and enough food and allowed them to live a good life before they would be killed humanely. I asked whether he thought that they would produce enough meat to meet the demand that Americans have. And he said yes, because they grew up naturally, there would be a lot more and better quality meat on them. So yes, according to this student, such a process would be very sustainable.
David is a can of balls. Smh
David is a can of ballz

Cannibals
Ryan is  misinformed about  veganism and food shortages but i like his open mindedness about it.
I really like off the pill I watch it every week but this week was just full of you guys saying really stupid things I think (if I’m allowed to say that because apparently I’m not allowed to form a negative opinion of something and post it in the comments). I don’t understand what’s wrong with people leaving bad comments. Since when is disagreeing with something and voicing your own opinion in the hope of a reply from people with differing opinions, time consuming and something only horrible people do. If someone enjoys something they will like it and comment a nice thing, but doing the opposite is not okay? Makes no sense. Also the whole thing about killing certain animals in different cultures was thought of in such an ignorant way I think. David said any death is as gruesome as the other which is ridiculous. Also there wasn’t even a thought about the sentience of the  specific animal.
canaballs
I think that aliens or "super humans" would be developed to the point where their brains aren't developing any more so their body's would be developed more so they would be smarter and stronger.
I love love love the podcast and sorry David but your a cannibal, cannon ball, and a can of balls
Is nigahiga subbed to pewdiepie?
So much ignorance in this video 🤦‍♂️
Hey I just met you,

And this is crazy.




But here’s my comment,

So like it maybe...?
Being vegan and vegetarian by choice is a luxury
U know what ?
I know David Choi for the first time here cuz I watched this podcast 
And the song by my side or by you side is so wonderful
You guys should get KevJumba on the podcast!
Somebody say Minnesota
aw i feel bad for david i actually agreed to some of the things he said in the last podcast. i don't know why people got so angry or what "activated" the hate really. i really like david and the conversation they had in the last episode too it was really good and interesting, it was nothing boring going on. david if you read this (i know you wont) nosotros papaya.

David is a can of balls lol
We don’t eat dogs and cats because in our history, dogs helped us hunt and cats helped us get rid of animals like mice and rabbits that were eating our crops, so it wouldn’t have been advantageous for us to eat them.

Canaballs
I’ve been a vegetarian literally my whole life, so I have no experience with meat and fish, but even when I have to kill fleas to help my dogs I feel slightly bad. I couldn’t even imagine fishing.. I’d probably start crying on the dock, haha.

(But hey! You do you, I’ll do me! Doesn’t mean my morals are any better than yours!)
it literally took me 50 mins to notice paco wasn't here
I don't normally watch "I Dare You", but if someone's having their foot eaten by the others I'd make an exception.
Is dat oj?
Ryan is the only youtuber thats stayed golden for over 10 years

KAMEHAMEHA!! Ryan the effort you put into your videos is outstanding! Never quitt YouTube!
Whisper-rap should be an ASMR category 😂
How is this masterpiece just get 1.2M views? 

...
Youtube algorithm
Dear Ryan can you make a full song just whisper rapping. Make it a new genre.
The most underrated artist ever. Love this 💜
Others: rap god is the fastest rap ever
Me : hold my ..silence..



Plays ryan higa song  part
I won't share this video, I keep it to myself. Introvert life!
At first glance I thought this was a weird al video
Screaming that "WHOOOOPS!!!" had me laughing so hard lmao
...okay but now when the extroverts see this they’ll know our secret tactics for leaving parties early 😭
This song makes me feel tired of yelling...






And I’m not even yelling
Ayo where's the Spotify at tho?


Like if you want it!
Dear Ryan, can you give us an update on Rustin Hieber?
DEAR RYAN , CAN YOU MAKE A SPOOF/TRAILER OF BROOKLYN NINE NINE?
Lol pretend to be drunk to avoid saying bye 😂😂😂 genius
If you spell Trevor backwards and add “int” it becomes introvert... but if Trevor is backwards in “introvert”... does that make Trevor an extrovert?
an introvert says to an extrovert...
"GET INTROVERTED!!!'"
Extrovert:" you chill bro..."
Introvert:"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHJ BUT YOUR HANDS DOWN!!!!"
Dude .... u just never disappoint.. Jesus Christ this is a Banger
Actually got the asmr tingles in the whispering bit 😂👌
I got Turn Down For What vibe
The whisper part was low key flames😂😂
Title: "how to make a club banger" get introverted

Me: Haha, you fool. You cant make a introvert turn into a introvert. Im a introvert above all introverts!
It proves that, how a good music, a good video, amazing editing and hell shit lyrics can make a music look good...
I'm not kidding Ryan, I got Spotify premium so I could download this song. Is it on Spotify or nah?
You know a lot of videos on YouTube take a long time to make and they consist of a lot of effort. But they don’t get the views they deserve. Kind of like this one, but this is just how YouTube rolls.
l swear Ryan has done every genre of music next is Christian rock
Anyone ever gone to the party just for the food? Then left while pretending to be busy chatting with someone on the phone so that no one stop you?

No?

Okay.
If Ryan is an introvert then I don't speak at all 😶
"WHAT!"
"WHO?"
"OKAAAAY!"
Nigahiga 2019
When they were making the lyrics up I thought Ryan said " COME GET YOUR BURGERS"!
Thank you for this anthem for us introverts. I'll listen it alone in my room often now.
4:57 I bet everyone was expecting this: Hey, how you doin'  lil mama lemme whisper in ya ear...
ryan saying clubber doesn't make it better it only makes it sound like youre clubbing animals
Yes, NO PODCAST
I’m watching this!
anyone get the joke: "We heard 'Turned Down for What' recently"(in the screenshot it said released 5 years ago)
Nobody:

Ryan Higa:  let's drop a dope video much cooler than other real music artist do now a day.
Did you edit the beginning cause 

When the video came out you whispered a little bit of 'Turn down for what'
Why tf this video has so low views? 
Let's don't talk about subscribers. it's been a year still 21M.
This is actually good wtf! That whisper part thing is the best.
Anyone know what the background music is at like 0:58? 😂
LET'S MAKE BGA COMEBACK
Like so Ryan can see this
That OK at 2:24 reminded me of his How to rap video and had me dying
Am I the only who feels this has a vibe of turn down for what in the main drop
Is it just me, or does that Les Paul on the left in the beginning of the video have mini-humbuckers?
lowkey 6ix9ine vibes 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️😂
Actually love the whispered rap part
If he’s not a genius then idk what he is
Do you know how disappointed I was to not find this on spotify
this is such a bop
Hide in your garage or whatever... For a long period of time!
I appreciate this because I'm an EDM producer.
*walks into bathroom
Runs into 3 guys hiding
"BUT IT"S OK!!!" LMFAO, this was seriously so good!!!  you never seize to surprise me :))) good job guys
Should be voted best and most relatable song of 2019…cast your vote now
The only YouTuber who is creating PLATINUM content , EVERY SINGLE TIME.
Dear Ryan Can you do more BGA(boys generaly Asian) 

P.S DONG SAYA DAE!
BgA We NEED BOYS generally Asain  PLEASE RYAN MAKE A NEW SONG
Why does the whispering part sound so cool?
4:57-5:07 A Youtuber invented a new genre, ASMRap
Personally i think when you guys say "Get introverted" it should have more bass & bounce but all together its pretty banger
(Its alot better on max volume)
Dear rayn, make an entire song with whisper rap
Lil John X Ying Yang Twins 😂
that whispering part is lit!! get introverted!
3:48 is what you came for, you’re welcome
Oh boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii <3
Bangerrrrrrr
Club Banger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i liked the 'KAMEHAMEHA!' for some reason
I don't know that whisper can get this cool.
Damn I like that whispering.
I feel bad for this video though, it deserves more views.
Dear Ryan can you a Mukbang video on every day things
okay .. whisper rap is a game changer
STILL. After 10 years you still make me laugh! Keep it up❤️
Is this a sign for the new BgA comeback 👀🌚
Y’all have no idea how many times I repeated the whisper rap part

First of all i YouTube algorithm...
INTJ's unite!
I dig this!! Lol. I’m an introvert so 💁🏻‍♀️ 🤘🏻
3:49

He's underappreciated now :(
And he got only 20M subs 🙂💔
Man that 8 grapes in my mouth!!!!!  , who else remembers it ?
I can’t find the song on Spotify, am I blind? XD 

It’s a wonderful song!
10/10 will keep my hands down in a club when this song is played iNtRoVErt
Ryan is so amazing lmaooo
David too! Love this
From the moment I heard Ryan saying "KAMEHAMEHA!!" I knew that was going in the lyrics lmao
BEST YOUTUBER EVER. Y'know it's the same generation when Lil Jon's style is included.
TOO MUCH IN THE CROWD EVERYBODY SPREAD OUT
oh man I feel this way too much
This'll be my new JAM!!!
He tried to sound like Lil' Jon but ended up sounding like Tekashi 6ix9ine
I think u deserve no 1 spot
Ur contents r very entertaining
😂😂
Omg thank you for this, this is one of the funniest videos you've done in YEARS, love it! 🤣🤣
"Club Banger"??? I barely even know her 😂😂😂
I’ve played this song so many times now my brother hates it. It is however my anthem.
Glad I caught this so early, I feel like this is gonna blow up.
Wow almost 100k
How fast can you get this on spotify?
Dear ryan: try to break a world record(any)
Who else before 1 mil views?
I think your videos became irrelevant😬
All I was doing was waiting for him to yell kamehameha during the song lol....I'm glad he did it 👏👏👏
Oh no Smoshs prediction turned out to be correct Ryan Higa is now a blogger and I'm totally fine with that.
Okey, this song is dope! Nice job Ryan and David!
my calm introvert anthem is Party by dodie
Ryan! You always make us so proud!!
PLEASE add your music to Spotify 🙏🏼
You put so much effort in your videos! Love off the pill podcast btw. I listen every week 😄
As an introvert I love this ❤
LiLRy is so underrated
Bro, imma say it right now. This is a straight 🅱️anger!
"we heard turn down for what recently"
ryan that came out over 4 years ago
Got secondhand sore throat listening to Ryan screaming
Why did I only just get the notification for this? It says 1 hour ago 😂
This was just awesome. Keep it up man ;)
When I go to the club I go to the bathroom alot.

DEEEAAAADDDDDD 😂😂😂
Absolutely need a Ryan Higa hardcore metal track with a dirty breakdown
3:35 hoping kamiamia makes into the final song

AND MAIN MAN DON'T DISAPPOINT!
This is actually pretty good! 🙌
When they say get introverted without the vocals hahahahahaha
They sound like they practicing for a death metal.  ALL THAT SCREAMING? Should low key be a dear Ryan saying to make a death metal
Dear Ryan could you make everyday trick shots 2.0
That whispering tho 😂😂
Dear Ryan, pls let BgA make an EPIC COMEBACK
I love how Ryan's channel keeps being the best, even after years
"That's where you go to the club and..." 😂😂😂😂
5:55 that death drop tho also 4:57-5:07 was pleasant
I m really sad that you stuck on21m (._.)
You r the only 1 i found making great videos
the whisper rap was done so well.. wat
Love it haha. Ryan, I relate to you a lot lol. I also have adhd and am an introvert :'). Anyways, adding the kamehameha was great xD
Dear Ryan can you make a song about traffic rules
Dear Ryan, please make a video with KevJumba again soon. Thank you ❤️
CRAZY!!!🔥🔥🔥
I think my favourite part of this song is the panic in the voice at "Trevor's way too loud"
Hey Ryan! Could you do a Visual Kei music video?
3:49 for the club banger
YAASSSS that was amazing!!!! Represent the introverts!!!!
Ryan's face expressions are always so perfect.
The whisper part sounds like Mix Up by Mr. Popular
You should watch the full video but for those who is here only for the song it starts at 3:48
That's a introvert anthem of the year 🔥🔥😂
no club banger is reak without the whispering rap xD and funny scene xD
parody of endgame next
]
Finally! Us introverts can now move forward from this pain of being anthemless 😭We are eternally grateful
"Get introverted" has the exact same beat as "Talk dirty to me" lol
Ryan reminds me of my martial arts teacher.....






No offense, but he really does
turn down for what remix basically
damn,
not only did i connect on an astronomical level to the bit with the 4 dudes in the toilet, 
but it also made me realize that they should whisper more in rap. such quiet lyrics backed by a hard ass beat gives a weird like intense feeling idk.
Some says Pewdiepie is best and some says it's T-series but deep down we all know that Nigahiga is the best❤
Lmaoo This Video is great.. .Ryan is Back Ladies n Gentlemen 🏆
THANKS FOR MAKING AN ANTHEM FOR US! ✨
Filthy frank then Joji
Nigahiga then Ryan Higa
Long live introverts.

Introverts’ lives matter too.
Thank You, FINALLY a song for the Introsquad.

I can't believe 😂😂😂 i love it. Do you have it on spotify or somewhere?
I'll just leave my comment here just before it reach 1M.




As a memorial
This is why I love Ryan. A proud lamp ❤️
Well, this is perfect.
I LOLed at Ryan having to censor David's dirty joke in the beginning 😂
When will this be on Spotify?
THE BEST PART WAS BEING INTROVERTED WHILE BANGING THIS ALONE IN MY ROOM FOR MY FAMILY TO HEAR OUT OF THE BLUE. FINALLY MY FAM GETS IT LOL
If Ryan is considered introverted 



Then I don't know what I would be considered 😢
Crazy how famous Ryan and his whole crew got super famous from Youtube and just making videos. Bet they all make hella money! Lol Yo Ryan, loan me like $1,000 bro lol
Ryan's videos never disappoint. Talented people right here 🦄
So glad he kept the kamehameha 👍🏼
Whispering part low-key fire
'Get Introverted' sounds like my kinda thing
Bro why was the whispering part kinda amazing
im laughing so hard at ryan just screaming
I like festivals and concerts cause everyone is focused on the performance, parties and going out are not for me 😂
Could someone PLEASE make an instrumental version of this?!?!
Honestly, this is kinda good😎😎
We absolutely need a BGA comeback
I always come back to listen to this haha
hahaha nice, most underrated youtuber
That was soooOoo good! Lol yassss more songs pleaseeeee😂👍😊
YOOO BUT THE WHISPERING PART MADE THIS WHOLE THING SO MUCH BETTER
Are you ready to get hyped up ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Ryan the OG King of YouTube

Dear Ryan,

Thank you
Ay does this pop up on Spotify for anyone else because it's not showing up for me

How long have you been at 21m subs?
How do I say your name without getting jumped
Is it true that Ryan stop making SKITZO???
Finally! A club banger I can vibe with
that whisper bit was lowkey my favorite part of the song
Is david choi playing hawkeye in avengers endgame
Love these making music vids keep going
Ohhh yeah... I got a new ringtone and  it's awesome 
Then later I watched this video. I changed it again..😂
Rapping about introverts reminds me of pH-1 🧡
My name is actually Trevor and that is painfully me on a philosophical level
Wow this turns out to really good! GJ!
dang!, that shows how much our man ryan puts effort since 2006 till 2019! awesome (the only good youtuber left)
You scrapped the DANCE!?
Sounds a lot like Lil Jon and Tekashi69😆
I feel like you forgot the kick at the drop with the 808 bass but whatever, I really love the whispering part
I love this 😂. I'm going to play this specially when I go out now
5:23 Freaking Trevor... always making our plans go south 🤦‍♂️
They go to parties but


Ice tray hole coke rise
Everything he touches becomes golden.. more like Mida Higa
this is so fLUSHING LIT BRUH
They are called EDM songs.
your rapper name should be 'LIL RYE'
this is actually in spotify lol
Lmao Lil higa
I’m so glad they put the kame hame ha part in there I died laughing😂😂😂😂
WE NEED A BgA COMEBACK!!! KPOOPERS HAS STARVED ENOUGH! Theme could kpop scandals

Why doesnt the sub count of nigahiga increase😥






He is a great youtuber people subscribe

I thought Ryan as a Bruno Mars by seeing thumbnail :D

Beat actually slaps 🔥🔥💯
Dear Ryan,
Please bring back BgA
People keep saying his channel is dead but he's still my favorite YouTube everrrr
😂😂😂😂 like the podcast but I was missing this videos 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪
Bro why does this sound like 6ix9ine
Now i have to see mumble rap again😂
I actually loved the whispering part
As a lamp for years and also an introvert i really appreciated thisss hahaha.

hoping that being an introvert wouldn't be like, normified or conquered by those bandwagons "oh I'm also an introvert"
It's quite easy to scream once you figure out the technique and are comfertable with it. I have been doing metal screams for 6 years now
RYAN HIGA JUST INVENTED ASMR RAPPING
I love those kind of songs! 
Maybe you could do something retro? Like 80s/90s influenced? Could be about all those people saying "you are only a true 90s kid when..." Because those people are so annoying and I think you could bash the hell out of them!
Ryan looks like Latrelle from on my block in the thumbnail
Always original content, best youtuber out there <3
ryan: you need to make a super generic pop song
All of those introverted thoughts are exactly what I like to do every time.
It starts in 3:50 thank me later
Like it, its at 99k, get it to 100k
Now that everyone knows Old Town Road,
make Hick-Hop
Leave a like if you remember their song “hardcore” if so your an og

Lyrics almost like you’re robbing a bank
Favorite part is ❤
GET INTROVERTED 
Where yall at Introvert Squad
Wow... I really like the whispering part
Where is the tutorial on "How to get invited into parties"?
I loved the whispering part !
Ryan would be such a good voice actor
If this isn't played at every school dance now, I'm suing.
Amasmmamamamazing as usual!!!!! Although I love your podcasts, I guess it’s hard for some of us viewers to keep up with them because they are too long... but fighting!
Dear ryan can you do a dark web weapons video
You watched turnip for what you need to watch drop the vase

He’s probably more an ambivert
I knew they would put Goku in there!!
When you watch this after spending an entire day indoors
This song makes me feel introverted

In highschool,  I ate my lunch in the restroom so that i dont have to interact with anyone.  Its kinda gross i know.

That's umami's interface character on his back :O 1:00
Lmfao. When all fails there's always the Joestar family trump card... NIGERUNDAYOOOOOO!

Nobody: 

Everybody: Old Town Road


Ryan: How to make an introverted club banger




Everyone:

This was stuck in my head
I LOVE RYAN
Like if u do too


Edit : Like so Ryan can see our love
Hahahahahahaha this is just too awesome and hilarious!! Ryan never disappoints!! Loving this song so much! Specially the lyrics and the way you sang it!😊
The bathroom scene I caaaan't
Youtubers make songs in one sitting but artist take 3 years to release an album
Blizzard guides song in the video, Pog.
WHO LOVES JAMAICAN RYAN?
Dude that’s a lot of screaming
Everything you do turns out awesome, even as a joke howww
Not gonna lie the whisper part was amazing. Anyone else agree?
The whisper stuff is intriguing. lots of potential there
That endgame Hawkeye haircut
The song would be great if the lyrics were whispered.
My gosh it was so good! Wasn’t expecting it to be good 😅 making my bf listen to it
I can't find the song anywhere on Spotify??
4:58 is like an ASMR lol
Oh good bro there’s actually a thousand more guys in here
Dear Ryan,
Do you eat your bananas with or without the crust?
This is a dope club banger right here
The way he through the cup at the guy n ran. I felt that 😂
The "whisper" part is actually sooooooooo awesome!!!
Got that lil Jon vibe from ushers yeah going for him
Does somebody have the Spotify link?
Dear Ryan, can you make a classical version of Old Town Road?
The whisper rapping at 4:57 was my favorite part.
Did I spot a Jacob Fu lol
do an i dare you with mr beast
Honestly, I got so hyped during the song. 3min ago, I was ready to sleep. Now I wanna go to a trampoline park.
Ryan predicted U WAS AT THE CLUB the next big club banger!
Lil Jon needs to copyright this because this was so unoriginal
WHEN WILL THIS BE AVAILABLE ON SPOTIFY
Ain't nobody trying to talk to TREVOR
I 💀ed the entire time
Me: EDM
Ryan, an intellectual: cLub BaNGeR
a new non-spin off how to video. nice ryan.
Bruh, taking a break in the bathroom and then pretending to be intoxicated to avoid any conversations is fucking genius. Thank you Ryan, I took note
what an awesome bop listens to lyrics I'm an Extrovert but who cares, GET INTROVERTED!!!!!!!!!!!!😂
Yo can you do a song with tiny meat gang
How are there 22 comments within 14 seconds of posting!?

Thank you for wasting your time dear reader 😂
It would be awesome if they played this song in clubs
Finally! A song I can relate to.
I like going to the club and dance but don't like talking to people there. Am I considered an introvert?
Ryan and David were in the club when I first met them 
Couldn’t talk enough 
Had to get them straight extroverted
Sounds like every 6ix9ine song ever.
its an awesome banger




btw when is ur bga song gonna come
boom kick boom-boom kick
All my introverts stand up to our national anthem
Everybody: "sees the title."
Me:You was at the club.....
listening to this hurt my voice
that asmr was on fire!!!!
that guy pouring puzzle pieces over himself made me lol
this some goku shiz lmao
Thank You Ryan for making original non-podcast videos again...
Could jam out to dis
Is it just me but around 2:25 i thought that they were gonna do some takashi 69
Dear Ryan- can you do a dis track for this?
This channel has the best content on youtube
Ryan is the only YouTuber whose video gets me excited every time, no matter a sketch, a podcast, a  music video, or any other. He is just awesome.
This song basically sums up my life 😊😊
Start felt like Hannah Montana.
Why is this an actual bop??
4:24 I didn't want to sleep anyway xD
David: "What does introverted people do?"

Me: Sit in their room and watch stupid things like this
622 dislikes coming from the extroverts xD
Yes!! 😂😂
What is the name of the song used in the vid during the making of the clun banger?
Pretty good, but needs more bass
3:48
For those who just want the song
Nothing's worse then trying to be outgoing but looks disingenuous and you end up spending the next five years not going to a single party.
I dont belong in this club ft Macklemore is basically a song about introverts right?
trevor felt offended(gta 5)
I've never went clubbin' before but why do I find this song sooo relatable? 😂
I thought they will make something like u was at the club
If ryan higa actually start a music career
UHH RYAN??????????? AZ AN INTROVERT I LOVE IT SO DAMN MUCH
Article 13👏🏻
David be lookin like hawkeye in endgame lol 0:05
Dear Ryan 
Can you eat the hottest pepper in the world and drink coke
My headphones ran out of battery  at the beat drop
Introverts are gay
There are only two genders change my mind
does anyone know the background jazz-hop song when he introduces the steps??
This gets me introvturnt

It's a stretch I know.
WTH THIS IS GOOD ASF
Daamn this was good👍🏼🔥
I LOVE IT!!!!!
Can you make those conspiracy theories you used to make about the new black hole or something
David rocking that Hawkeye haircut
Thanks to this video I've realized that I'm an introverted person. I've never been to a club but I always hide in the bathroom when I go to the movie theaters early. I don't have any friends so i always go alone. I get so nervous in public places where a lot of people hang around. Is there a way to fix this?
Dear Ryan, you should swim with dolphins and enjoy life ..
Press 8 for your favorite part.... Press 9 for your second favorite part.     :D
The shouting is all built up from those podcasts
I can't believe Introverts are socializing with other introverts... What a crazy world we live in
I didn’t get notified for this video 🤨
David looks like Ronin played by Jeremy Renner in Endgame
oh yes after a long time i have that old feeling of loving nigahigas creative videos, this was very much your style ryan love it!
we need an entire rap video in that whispering voice XD
Got swept into the party crowd and was always known as a downer. Thanks ryan for making me feel okay about myself seeing all my moves being played out haha
☝
My names trevor
Bro, how is clout by offset getting more views than this? I think Ryan needs to hire a shameless stripper like Cardi b to show her ass in a video for millions to see, but that's not Ryan, he has morals :-). So underrated.
top 10 rappers eminem was too afraid to diss
Can You Make "How To Make DUBSTEP"?
Time flies past so fast, I still feel like ‘Exposed’ is a new video ;)
Yes an accurate song!
Sounds like one of those stop smoking ads lmao
not gonna lie, that whispering part was literally fire
At the drop I was expecting turn down for what
Musical genius ❤️
So I guess you're literally turning down for what
Damn pure 🔥
the gamer is the only who got out lol
This is so good.  Are you going to put it on Amazon Music?
A banger indeed 🔥🔥
2:33 riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
:couchcocainecough:
Definitely sounds like one other song in fast and furious
This low key slaps
2:19😂😂 sped up 2x
I love this like I do Alessia Cara's song Here!
The Drop shouldve been more hard, good song tho.
Hi, This is the FBI. If you are reading this, you are in danger. This is not a drill, your life is actually in danger. Please look around the road before walking across it as many people die daily due to road accidents.
Thank you,

nigahiga has made a video a second ago
I have joined in a milisecond to comment
Would this get a copyright streak if I used the melody? I think the melody would be a perfect outro song.
Did David just made a cameo in Shazam? In the bus scene.
Does Ryan has music channel, like I want to hear this piece in youtube as separate thing? I would like to have this separate things on Youtube, even if it's month after the fact, it would be cool to add to playlist here too.
The absolute last sound wasn't TEEHEE this time!
Yep we all know a Trevor 😑
Intro song name? ( I know it's not sandstorm)
Club bangers are usually trap songs...
I relate to all of this.
It so bad which makes it so good. Love it
I feel like there's more extroverts and ambiverts in the world than introverts? 😂😂💀🤷🏻
Why go to a party alone, even though your an introvert
Thank you!!!
Dear Ryan, can you make a cover of Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' in techno?!
Love that whisper segment haha
Its sad to see a Creator like ryan to lose his subscribers and not grow (looked at his social blade)
That whisper had that asmr feeling
4:58 ASMR at its finest
4:58 is kinda lit
Uh couldn’t find this song on Spotify
Nobody:

Ryan: "How to make a Club Banger"
the whisper rap part killed me
SKSKKSDJDHDJD LMAO
When is BGA’s comeback????? We need a comeback!!!!
Dear Ryan, can you make a parody of the song "Believer" by ImagineDragons?
1 view, 150 likes apparently

YouTube is fine
* DJ snake wants to know your location *
I feel like more of a buildup to the first beat drop would make it a whole lot better, but good song still!
I'm an introvert and I love this .
The best club banger is a hand grenade thrown into the dance floor
Remake how to be emo we have been waiting for so long
Best song ever ! Youtube needs contents like this 👽👾
Yeah, an introvert with 21mln subscribers, sure

Ft. Lil John
Hey Ryan, if that’s your Les Paul in the back, can you send it to me?
Dear Ryan, Can you make a parody of The Seven Deadly Sins?
Kind of feel bad for Trevor — he's just trying to be nice. 'Course, I'm the one that'd be trying to escape, too, so I get it.
Marshmello
I am the best DJ
Ryan

You might as well be a rapper dude
notice how at the start the kick and the bass are in time with ryans mouth
I'm an introvert, but I'll totally dance to this song.
Yes more David please.
Do more of these, they're awesome!
you and david should make a channel on your music and add ads at the begginning of the video and near the end just cause
when Will was rapping shit was fire
Ryan do you remember the Nintendo Paper/cardboard video you made, Well Guess what now they are actually making it, how ironic. Also I have had 8grapes in my playlist for a long time. Also low key this is a banger🔥🔥
That's catchy ⚡⚡⚡🔥🔥
Whatever people do, Ryan and Friends do it better
How to sing like your favorite artist 3 is here!

This song is aimed at introverts but it's so loud
Awesome man!
The bridge in the song is legendary.
Best song ever. So relatable.
talks about bathroom
talks about party
me: Michael in the bathroom
Actually better than most rap-like songs nowadays.
They should play this in libraries. Wait, no, not libraries. Barnes & Noble. That's where they should play it. 📚🎶😄
Yo this song Smaaaccckkksss!!!!!!!! Great job!!
4:58 Oddly smooth
I played this at a random frat party... never getting the aux again lmao
It's like he's seen me at parties XD
that 'kamehameha' haha

I think that's the psycho black guy from D Trix's old vids. Lmaoo
Ryan being Ryan. Now is when you know who the real fans are. The ones that still stick with him now. Keep going Ryan.
He's slowly rising again
Use your core next time, not your throat...But I love this song

His yelling voice  kinda sounds like a  guy singing heavy metal
The quite bit is asmr lol
The toilet part was the best
I feel like it's an other version of 'turn down for what'
Everybody, BgA comeback has been confirms (on Ryan's Insta)
RELATABLE. CONTENT.

Michael in the Bathroom was my introvert song until this

You really need a Netflix show dude. The potential u have is crazy
Sounds like a six6nine9 song lol
Has a very turn down for what feel.
Why is Ryan so good at rapping  in jealous
Dear Ryan, can you make a thriller trailer about the first image of the black hole?
"What do we do now? Is thats it?"
You have too much faith in the effort put into modern pop and club music
5:01 flow on point damn
Im here for the whisper rap part of the song lol
Sooooooo coool man!!!!!!!
Turn down for iNtRoVeRtEd
Put this on Spotify pleeaasee





Oh wait😞
I unsubbed after a really long time, but recently resubbed. I thought your vids would end up becoming like every other YouTuber that get’s washed up, boring vlogs or gaming vids.

I was wrong, your vids, even after so many years of unsubbing, still make me feel the same happiness and give me the same laughs as when I watched you when you were making videos with KevJumba. Some things don’t change and through so many years you’re still able to keep that same hilarious vibe to your videos. Keep it up, Ryan!
holy shit, what a bop
4:57 is golden
Sounds like 6ix9ine 😂
I'm still listening to Ignored, Bromance, Coffee Shop Love, the lot
snapped a 4:59 goddam I wasn't ready
Yoooo so on point Loved it
The is low key sad lmao
Sounding like dmx
My friends: Hey, wanna come to this party?
Me: Uh...um.... I'm busy. I have  so much homework to do and I have to clean my room
My friends: Oh, maybe next time
Me: Maybe......
Also me at home: I got 2 more books to read! YES!
THAT 4:04 GUY IS CUTE THO??
Yeah this song sounds more like robbing a bank 😂😂. " Put your hands down "  and " no one look around" .
2:24 go watch the " how to sing like your favourite rapper" video  this okayy was a refrence from ryans old mimic video!
Dont get me wrong I love this song and the whisper part is freaking awesome but is it me or does the drop feel a bit weak?
2:22 When your teacher catches you talking
 and told 20 people before you to shut up.
More BGA.
I hope Ryan sees this, but in order to avoid stressing your voice while yelling, try not to engage the upper part of your throat too much; instead, try belting out your shouts from your diaphragm and chest. A tip is to just spend a minute warming up the muscles needed, such as breathing in with your nose and breathing out with your mouth in a way that you're forcing the air out by making your stomach cave in (I hope that makes sense). Anyway, great vid as always!
David choi is actually just David so
pls this was so cute!
Colors and Ryan's hairstyle with the hat reminds me of good boy by gd and taeyang
Rip Vocal cord
Ayy who remembers Ryan making so many music videos at one point, where it was pretty much only music videos
666 dislikes? Bet Satan doesn't want to get introverted.
That whispering part was clean
Love the videos with David! Keep up the good work Ryan
Dear Ryan, can you make a K-Pop MV?

I needed this, I've had Lego Movie 2's Catchy Song stuck in my head for the past 2 days and this was the perfect solution.

All the people who dislike this is named Trever.
Kamehameha, really random and out of place lol
I loved this!

Totally the most amazing thing I’ve seen in soooooooooo long!!! I’m an introverted exotic dancer. (How does that work you might ask) usually with bad ass stage performances but lame conversations were I say uncool things I should NOT say and have to have the moment saved by other dancers 😅 anyway My Dj and I argue a lot because I like metal and he only plays me rap songs with crapy lyrics I feel uneasy dancing too. So I gotta ask you guys can I have permission to use this song as my  on stage redemption??
The screaming starts at 3:48
this song is actually really good, I like it
I don't even know what a club banger is.
Lol I’m an extraverted guy named Trevor

Hmm okay.
LOVE THIS
3:48 the real deal
Another great idea :))) 👍👍👍☝

Dear Ryan, who's your bias in BgA? 🕊❤
onisly  the vide game was me 2 years ago
I love it lol
Why is this song talking about me
Not enough base.
"There hasn't been a club banger since turn down for what" 
Me: bts mic drop
Nice song and vid! For me, I rather go to a club and dance with one or two good friends. We can dance and everyone is minding their own business  (I mean the music is so loud you can't really talk anyway) perfect! But going to a friends house for dinner even if he/she just invited like 10 people I'll probably try to avoid going.
I love Will's rap.
:)
Best part 4:57
what was the music between each step like at 1:29 or 2:09?


EDIT: It's called: Old School by Under Ground Kings

At speed 0.75, it is the correct speed for the Hannah Montana theme. At the beginning of the video. 0:00
I expect more 808 bass on the drop but I wasn't disappointed.

Michael in the bathroom by himself....
Im not gonna lie, Paco really helps direct the show and hit the main points - especially for listeners rather than watchers i imagine. He is really good at his show.
Dear Ryan, can you use the predictive text on your keyboard to make a rap?
I feel like Ryan hired Paco for the sole purpose of psychoanalyzing him
I didn't skip to the end, 'cause I'm a real one.
Comment: How does Ryan never age?
Me:
Ryan’s laugh: hehehehe!
Wills laugh: hahaha
Pacos laugh: hAhAHaHaHA!!
Dear Ryan can you make a video without editing
Paco: take it with a grain of salt 
Ryan: take it with a grain of sugar 
Will: 👁👄👁

What are RHPC's MBTI personality types?  I didn't skip to the end. :)
How close is RHPC personally. Like, what’s the difference between your work relationship, and your personal relationship with each other. 

Love you guys :))

P.S. I didn’t skip to the end
I like to listen to the podcast while folding clothes like Marie Kondo. It makes the job easier
I didn't skip to the end. Love your podcasts as always!
"I didn't skip to the end". I'm sure my message will be buried within the comments.
BUTT!! I love watching/listening to the podcast while I'm just sitting and working on things!
Always keeping a smile on my face. <3
These podcasts are hilarious

QUESTION, what was your guy's ¿sketchy..est? Moments in life??
I have two reasons to think I relate more to asian people even though I'm from Brazil than american people:

- we use plastic bag from grocery shopping as trash bags
- we also say xixi (or shi shi) for pee
I need some of Ryan's anti ageing serum

“One of my favorite memories is when I got spanked by my dad..” ~Paco
Guess I'm a real one, bc I didn't skip to the end.
I love watching these podcasts. Also, if anyone ever stops watching a nigahiga video before the teehee happened, are you even a real one? 🤔
I didn't skip to the end.
Who else remembers when Ryan made a whole conspiracy video just to Rick Roll us at the end xD
Love the podcasts. Haven't missed one yet. 

Question: 
Can you judge a person by the job they are working ? 
Do you view the person differently if they are a YouTuber, policeman, office worker, fast food retail and etc
I miss" cooking but not really"
"I didn't skip til the end"
I'm a real one.
Looking back, how do you feel about "Ryan and Sean's not so excellent adventure"

Also I didn't skip to the end
I didn‘t skip to the end 💖 love your podcasts!!!
First of all, I didn't skip to the end. I'm a real one

My question is: do you ever think about the different impacts of your content in other people's life? For example, I learned and improved my english by trying to understand what Ryan said (you speak too fast in videos, man) and that made a huge impact in my life. PS I'm from Brazil and the first international video I ever saw was how to be a ninja (couldn't understand a thing but I loved it)
PLEASE sync up the bobbleheads behind Ryan
QUESTION: how do you feel about youtubers that are sellouts (ie doing sponsored posts for crap products) 

I did not skip to the end🤠
1) your content has changed and its more awesome now
2)i know i might have been living under a rock but i miss the days you where #1 on youtube
3) you are still a god my dude
34:48 I’m Hispanic and my family saves plastic bags. We use them to store certain grain foods and with the excessive amount we get at the store, we use it as trash bags (I think I’m gonna start doing what Will said, which was to bring your own bags to the store and use those. I’d rather do that and at least help the environment that way)
Just leaving some paco-love here :D doing amazing moderating the show, i really like how he carries and initiates topics🙏 love you guys rambling

And who the f just skips to the end?
Comment: How does Ryan never age?
Me:
Yall need some black people in this show. Watching you all trying to find out what "ride for me" means was a struggle
I didn't skip till the end. I'm the real one! :D
I didn't skip to the end.

Can you get Victor Kim on?
A question, what is Ryan's and the crew's relationship with Kyle like? We don't really get to see them together a lot
Here's two questions for you:
1. How do you balance your real life and your Youtube career?
2. Any tips for people wanting to start out on Youtube? I want to be a Youtube animator but want to know more about the website before starting off
Also I didn't skip until the end ;)

I know this is hella off topic but

RHPC = Ryan Higa Production Company

RHCP = Red Hot Chili Peppers
🧐
This straw-argument showed the american mindset imo like statisticly America is producing the most waste per household god damn guys do something for the enviroment
Saving plastic bags isnt only an asian thing I know many people that do it

I didn't skip to the end. 
Question: Where do you see yourselves in 10 years? :)

There was one guy I was dating that really wasn't good for me and one day I thought to myself I deserved someone as funny and as interesting as Ryan is so I ended things up with that guy, met the sweetest person I know that really takes care of me and now I'm married to him and really happy! So thank you, Ryan hahahah
Still wondering if they are in the same room

no seriously tho, i never do, these podcasts are genuinely interesting! =D
Hey Ryan I noticed despite being off the pill, your conversations have been seemingly normal and well-spoken. Maybe your adhd has overcome the need for medication?! Hehe btw this was uploaded on my birthday.
may be you should do off the pill live on instagram sometimes ❤️
nobody: ....
real ones: i didn't skip to the end
I would LOVE KSI on the show!



I didn't skip to the end!
I feel like Paco really carries the podcast sometimes and the way he gets mildly shut down can be disheartening lol.
I didn't skip to the end. R.I.P.
I didn't skip in the end
Obligatory hey~
I didn't know reUsing plastic bags as trash bags are an Asian thing! I'm mixed and have been doing it all my life!

More ghost/scary stories please.


?


oh and I didnt skip to the end
Ryannnnn why are your subscribers decreasing
I always love these podcasts that's why I didnt skip to the end.  Keep these coming guys you make work more enjoyable.
"I didn't skip til the end"
I'm a real one.
Wanted to say, i've been watching you for about 10 years but never really felt you were a real person in a way. Mainly because the videos were not so personal like other content creators. However, these are great and are suuupper interesting, and it really feels like you are bonding with your audience in some way. Keep it up man, love every single ep!
Can you talk about your ethnicity? Like which part of you feel connected to it? And what tradition/culture you practice?

RHPC seems pretty diverse, even if most are Asians.
"I didn't skip til the end, I'm a real one"
do some of you guys still plays dota?
I went through the entire podcast while studying for the my Econ exam tmr XDDD should have not stayed till the end.
Dear Pill the Podcast,
How do you guys solve internal conflicts? I think it's safe to assume that within your crew in the past & present, some kind of conflict was made. How was it solved? Or was it not solved at all? Really interested in the answers for this question because I think lots of friends go through this one time within their friendships and always want to solve it somehow someway.


ALSO: I didn't skip to the end, I'm a real one :^)
Ryan every podcast:
I haven't done my research, BUT ...
This "real one" did not skip to the end. 
Also, we always saved our plastic bags growing up. I always thought it was just a poor people thing (insert glorious Paco laugh)
Why would anyone skip to the end?!!?! 
This podcast is always amazing from start to finish. 
These random ones are my favorite! 💙💙✨
I did skip to the end !! hh no jk :p love these podcasts ;)

Dear Ryan, can you make a parody of Murder on my mind
I didn't skip till the end.

I never do, never will.
The comparison of horror and comedy movies heavily relying on timing to be effective is so insightful and the first time I ever thought of it that way. Great podcast as usual, guys! And for people who like to watch people be scared, watch Josh Macuga on Collider play horror VR games. He's hilarious.
I think this is the shortest podcast so far.. I wanted more!!


Plus I'm a real one and didn't skip to the end.
Question for Ryan: Was there a point in your YouTube career that you thought you could never go back to a regular life and how did you deal with it?
you should talk more about conspiracy theories in the podcast, its interesting!
I didn't  skip to the end.
So what are your guilty pleasures? 
Something you know is wrong but do anyway.
I didn’t skip to the end :0)

Btw, question: So you met an alien, and you have to hang out with it and 2 other people for a day, who will you pick and how will you all spend the day (and where?))

Keep up y’all :)
I didn’t skip to the end
i didn't skip to the end :)
(I didn't skip to the end, I'm a real one)

Dear Ryan, is there a definable differences in the way you're treated as a YouTuber compared to a tv actor/actress like your Gf?
The only podcast I can listen to while doing work! Thanks!!!
I didn't skip to the end I never did and never will because you guys rock my world!

I didn't skip to the end
I didn't skip to the end.

Question : if you can see the future, could you change it or will you trying to change it lead to that scenario?
I didn't skip to the end I really am a real one
Dear Ryan, can you make a video on expectation VS reality part 2
Wtf, no claps?? Blasphemy
As soon as I get to podcast 10 you post this, I'm never going to catch up.
I stayed till the end, cuz I’m a real one ;)
Dear Ryan make expectations vs reality random things 
I challenge you 😜
I love conspiracies.  I hope you do a podcast about your favourite ones. And yes to Derek's alien theories XD
I didn't skip to the end, I really hope I'm real as well
RIP nipsey hussle 
He was trying to do good for his community but was killed doing so🙏🏾
That will be great if you talk in next video about TV shows that will be so funny 😉 good job
I didn’t skip to the end 😏
@25:30 Don't talk more... We might die.
Minute later... 
How do you think you're  going to die?


Starts taking notes in knowing how the OTP will disappear "suddenly."
Good thing I didn't skip to the end, y'all who did missed a lot
I didn't skip to the end.😄

What are your MBTI personality types? (Of everyone at RHPC)
Ryan, what is your opinion on free will and does that change how you view life?

I'm a real one and I've listened to all your podcasts so you should take my question 😁
I didn't skip to the end! 💃💃💃
Technically you could make 100 1 second long videos and say you made 100
I watched the whole thing, and it’s great! Even though you said it was random, it was well constructed and you followed the topics really well. Oh and, I did not skip to the end. :)
i didnt skip til the end !
Do more how to act like your favorite actors
I didn't skip to the end, im a real one🤙
I didn't skip to the end! Also, who's laughter was it at 57:46 man :o

Mr. Beast Ryan is coming for you
You should recreate what you experience in Japan
I liked this podcast. You guys talked about things I find interesting. 10/10
What the! Poko is 5’9. Dude how short are you Ryan if I legit thought Poko was over 6’! 😆
Don't worry guys I didn't skip to the end
I never skip to the end! Its a great and chill podcast that i listen to while working :) Keep up the great work guys!
Saving bags isn’t strictly an Asian thing. I grew up saving bags and reusing them and I’m not Asian. I also wash plastic straws and reuse them like Will was talking about. I hate paper straws, but stainless steel straws are kinda cool.
Glad Best Day Ever is coming back. 
Btw, I didn’t skip to the end. ;)
No disrespect but damn i had no idea who nipsey hussle was
I love this podcast! I didn’t skip to the end!❤️❤️❤️❤️

If you had to choose a horror movie scenario to happen to you in real life, what movie would you choose and why?

I didn't skip til the end. 💊
imagine not being a real one by skipping to then end.
well,  can surely say that i didn't skip to the end 
am a real one here
Will - All he has to do is bury you in the woods.  Over time you'll dissolve into the plants. Woods are really good places to hide bodies anyway... or so I've heard...
The real conspiracy is why hot dogs and hot dog buns come in different numbers
Really enjoyed the talk on recycling! I think it's super important that we all do what we can to help the planet.
at 21 mins, the term will is lookin for is "howdo you escalate the issue"
dude can you make again about the theory like the old episode well i can give you an idea

I didn't skip till the end✌❤
"I didn't skip to the end"
Ryan just keeps getting hotter and hotter like WTF😍
curveball, i didn't skip to the end mahaha
I thought this was vanosegaming
One of my friends grandparents was murdered because they figured out how to sharpen medical knives faster and for a fraction of the cost (this was like 50 years ago). So yes, this stuff does happen. 

Another story: my dad had a friend who was given a PhD for creating a quick clean way to remove water from alcohol (so it could be used as an alternate fuel) while he was an undergraduate in college. Exxon bought the patent from him and hired him, locked the patent up (never used it - it would have lost them money), and after about 3 years they fired him. He ended up making a good deal of money during that time, but not nearly enough for his invention.
Didn't skip to the end, but I already love the podcasts so no point in doing it. :3
I'm so jealous that you met Conan O'Brien
Great Podcast!







I didn’t skip to the end 😉
I DIDN'T SKIP TO THE END. I'M A REAL ONE!
I'm da real one cuz I didn't skip till the end

I'm a real one and didn't skipped to the end.. haha love the podcasts! Keep it up!

What are your thoughts about people starting Youtube for money or to replace their jobs?
I didn’t skip to the end

Paco is ‘off his pills’ aha
I didn’t skip to the end. I’m a real one! 😉
I didn’t skip to the end. Cause I enjoyed all of it 😭😭😭
Paco looked like he's ready for End Game
onsen is hot springs! there is a really nice one in yamanashi prefecture that has an outdoor area. its so beautiful at night!
for izakaya, a lot are great but if you're looking for a boat full of karaage (japanese fried chicken) go to chiba chan!
What is your most embarrassing moment during your time in wrestling
embarrassing or crazy dating experience you've had? or the first time someone shattered your self esteem?
I'm a real one.. didn't skip it
I remember seeing you originally on the Ninja videos. Still can do the hand thing. Remembered you randomly and surprised to see your still doing videos.
Is it weird that I relate to paco sometimes, like I too like to see others getting verbally abused (like getting roasted or something) I mean thats why some people love diss tracks as well.
Took 30 mins just to get to the damn topic
Awesome Podcast Ryan!
Are there any videos that you hated filming, but originally loved the idea? 
And
Are there any conspiracy theories that you think are just too much of a stretch or way too possible? (Sorry for the wording I know it’s a little confusing)
honestly just ask simon and martina on yt about japan they’ll help u out :))
I didnt skip to the end. Also, what were your first impressions of each other?
I didnt skip to the end.

Paco, im 4ft 10". However,  i dont have breakable arms. Is that a must for u?
I didn't skipped to the end🤣
33:44 when Ryan says welcome back to the second part of the podcast but Auto generate captions thinks he says he is saying the 'f' word? 
I didn't stick to them end tho :(
I'm a real one, I didn't skip 'till the end. :D
Dear RYAN can you make a shout to theoriginalXGHD
After the playoffs can you get Jeremy Lin on the podcast?
Dear Ryan, please make a video on queen (the band)!
Id like to make this very clear. The earth will still be here regardless of what we do continuing onward. Regardless of how bad we, as humans, pollute this earth, it will not ultimately affect the endgame of the earth. What will happen is our own place on this earth will rapidly disappear to the point where our population will drop significantly.
Edit: I did skip to the end :^)
Woww another Sunday podcast uploaded on time..
Damn Ryan you are keeping your new year's resolution...
Love these podcasts! I didn't skip to the end.
Also, I didn't skip to the end
I didn't skip till the end.






I'm such a real one.

I didn't skip to da end m8.
I DIDN'T SKIP TO THE END WITH PURPLE ELEPHANTS!
When is bga coming back
I honestly relate to Paco so much like damn and Ryan reminds me so much of my cousin, these podcasts are my favourite to watch when I study and take the bus, like I see myself and my friends within the rhpc crew and it makes the podcast feel like I’m listening to a conversation with my friends
If Phil comes on, this can be called Off The Phil. :o
If a new video platform emerged that was similar to YouTube would you transfer your content there?
Yes, using re-usable straws make a difference. It is a collective problem especially for a big country like USA that usually throws away these non-recyclable plastics without a thought.  Also as of 2019, straws/stirrers were the 8th most found trash during cleanups.
You guys make the best podcasts and yh I acc didn't skip to the end and never did😬
DEAR RYAN CAN YOU WATCH THE SANS VS EVIL SANS VIDEO IF YOU DONT O WELL..
I think I've watched every podcast from start to finish, it's my Monday morning routine in this point: watching the podcast while cleaning my apartment. :D I know that probably sounds random. And I promise I didn't skip till the end.
I didn’t skip to the end. Ever 😊
I didn’t skip to the end 🤙🏽
How close is RHPC personally. Like, what’s the difference between your work relationship, and your personal relationship with each other. 

Love you guys :))

P.S. I didn’t skip to the end
"welcome! back ryan" how are you",
49:26 LOL goddammit Paco
Wait, is Paco's real name actually Will? I know Paco is his nickname, but his real name is Will?
I didn't skip to the end...😈
I know a lot of other YouTubers have talked about it already, but I'm wondering what RHPC thinks about the college scandal. It's walking the line of the Jussie Smollett incident
This guy with the beard had his mimd blown that big pharma companies profit off illness. The ignorance is blissfull.
ohkay, human centipede is just sick. my friend made me watch a few minutes of it and I legit wanted to throw up.

CIA's experimentation with mind control. That's a real thing, you guys should look it up
Dear Ryan can you do volleyball trick shots
will waving to the camera while paco talks about monica is the cutest :""")
Ryan! Not just an Asian thing! My family did the same thing with plastic bags! Still do.
I didn't skip to the end soooo I guess you could say I'm a real one
I think Paco gets the most love from us here, he is the best in the podcasts, i didn't skip to the end
What were the most difficult and devastating moments in your youtube career?
I've saved plastic bags as long as I can remember. They're great for cleaning up after your dog as well as cleaning out the litter box.
Who else is waiting for time stamps XD
Dear Ryan,
Make a skit of Annabelle Creation
There was a conspiracy about the CIA and MKUltra, a mind control program in the 1950’s. They used LSD’s and was brought to attention to the public in the 1970’s
"I didn't skip to the end".
shoutout to will tho for being eco-conscious 👍
A conspiracy that came true was: the the government is listening to your phone calls, and then it came out that the NSA was doing exactly that.
"I didn't skip to the end"
"I didn't skip to the end"
You guys should play Fatal frame! Would love to see their reactions.
As a Torontonian I lost it when Paco said "Vancouver and Toronto got some h0t girls" 😂
I DIDN'T SKIP TO THE END
I’m such a recycling fan. It makes me so happy that will said he tries. In Australia - everyone tries to recycle, and sort, into our bins. Kids learn it at preschool dude
dear ryan can you make narutoes vs narutoast and ten thay al fight magnetball z

I didn’t skip til the end..*heavy mic breathing*
How about chestersee on OTP podcast?
Why did Ryan consider YouTube and what are his favorite and least favorite part of it?
Me: acknowledges that Ryan is a grown man that can say whatever he wants 

Also me: DID HE JUST SAY SH*T
Lit
I just wanna take my medication
Ryan said he wanted to do the content he wanted to do. 

Still. Doing a podcast is pretty watered down at this point.
I have a question for the next podcast ==> Do you guys agree with this statement? "People only do things based on what they think is in their advantage"
I didn't skip til the end. Aye, I'm real.
i didnt skip to the end (was intresting)
Y u turn into smosh I loved you old vids
yay i'm a real one because i didn't skip to the end
Ryan should be the most subscribed and best YouTuber ever
Wut happend to da good vids? Like the trailers
Do y'all think about what your careers will look like in the future? Do you have strict plans for yourselves or is it more of a natural process.
I didnt skip to the end.
Does anyone else feel like Will loves recycling, Ryan isn’t a fan and Paco’s on the fence
Ryan seems so uncomfortable swearing 😂😂 28:06
To answer Will's question about conspiracies being proven true: the CIA MK Ultra experiments.  People suspected that the CIA was drugging the public for decades, and later it came out that it was true.
This is good Ryan, but please please bring back the comedy skits pls!!!!

My question for you guys: What is the sketchiest situation you've ever been in?
I didn't skip to the end... great podcast again! I feel like random is okay because you guys actually talk about the topics in depth instead of skipping around. My question for Ryan... would you ever want to move back to Hawaii, specifically Hilo? Why?
KevJumba should have a Best Day Ever. Also, one question, why do you end videos with TEEHEE and where did it originate from? I  didn't skip to the end.
America lied about being attacked in Vietnam to justify the war there. People were skeptical the whole time (counter culture movement was a part of this) and it got proven to be a conspiracy. US communism containment policy was whack
I didn’t skip to the end ✌🏽

Hey Ryan! If you were given a chance to learn about any culture in the world, who or what would you learn about? for example; Spanish, French, Italian, etc. OR my culture; the Hmong people? :) just curious about everyone's thoughts!

what's your opinion on the Seungri scandal/crime that's been evolving over the past month?
Hi Ryan and The Willy’s 

How close could a fan get to a celebrity before it’s an invasion of privacy? Do you think lawsuits should be filed? 
Many people argue that the celebrity chose this lifestyle and need to deal with it. 

What do you guys think 🤔 

Love you guys! ♥️

Thanks for answering my question btw! 😂😂🤙🏽🤙🏽💕💕
!!I DIDN’T SKIP TO THE END!!
There was a controversy in South Korea in 2015 concerning Park Geun-Hye, then president of South Korea. There were many conspiracy theories that she was under the influence of Choi Soon-Sil, a shaman and cult representative, who reaaaly influenced government and Korea. There was also Sewol Ferry incident and when it happened there were many speculation of links between Choin Soon-Sil and the accident as it was said that ferry has been intentionally drowned as a sacrifice for her cult (or something). I have written a whole essay on this conspiracy, haha. I would gladly send anyone curious about it, I think this topic was not talked about very much but it's very important!
So, conspiracy of Sewol Ferry was never really discussed that much in legal terms so there was nothing confirmed but conspiracy involving Choi SoonSil and Park geunhye have been confirmed and both of these women are now in jail. This incident and the truth thet came out of it had reformed government in South Korea and introduced many changes. This topic is very fascinating so I think many of you should read more about it!
why are everyone acting like yomyomf wasnt a thing?  u even have paco in ur podcasts  but u still didnt  metion theyomyomf once in all 11 podcasts... WHAT HAPPEND WITH IT?

i have been one to reduce my carbon foot. i have these sick metal straws that people find cool, its cheaper in the long run, i re use plastic bags but im actually switching to these color coordinated bags which helps make figuring out what items are where easier like green is for veggies and the red one is for meat ect., recently i got a water purifier and these sick re usable water bottles that have more things regular water bottles dont do. honestly i visited norway and after drinking their tap water and figuring out it was literally voss water i was like the fuck and got a water purifier, our future goal is to skip straight past gas vehicles and saving up for an electric car. i mean we are literally going to run out of gas in 53 years. its a fact look it up. we will still be alive when we use up all the fossil fuel.


 i know this makes me sound like i am self righteous or something but i am not. i am just strategizing what will be a better option for most things. every thing is cheaper easier, smarter for me and helps the planet so why not. with just the changes of the water bottle, and metal straws i calculated i save  $132 dollars a year. and i got the cheap stuff. i feel if you make the environmentally friendly options more cheaper and convenient more people will choose those options. there is a farmer truck in phoenix that skips the middle man and sales 60 pounds of vegetables and fruits for $10 bucks when i heard that i was siked!
I think a big conspiracy that was found out as true was the Watergate scandal
I think it would be cool if you did another podcast episode dedicated to conspiracy theories where each other you have completely different conspiracies against the same event/topic and try to reason and understand each other’s conspiracy!
Ryan's videos are getting lame.

I did not skip to end. I am the real one
I'm genuinely shocked. I live in California and I have been recycling my whole life, getting money each time I brought it to the recycling center. I get about $50- $75 every time I go (they do it by pounds where I live) I really thought that they did this everywhere.
Nah, I think a lot of people save their plastic bags. I use cloth bags mainly but when I do get plastic bags I save them to use in tiny trashcans and leave one in my car for garbage too. 
Another great podcast guys! I am really enjoying these. Great to listen to while I work!

p.s. I didn't skip to the end
I hate how these podcasts are his least viewed vide0s, these are great...

Will is completely right. Now it's more important not to recycle, but to try to NOT produce waste in the first place :)
But, why do you need a straw to begin with?
I'm european, so I might be living in a different world, but in my country, in a fast food place, you don't even get a cover and a straw if you don't ask for it. And I never take it, if I'm eating at the restaurant.
Is no one going to comment about the really awkward cut at 50:08?

You gotta start somewhere when it comes to saving our planet. If you hate reusable straws, don't use them. Why not.. oh I don't know, drink right from a cup? It's pretty easy.

The thing you asked about if there was a conspiracy being proven true, there is one and it's a big one. The Edward Snowdon conspiracy where the government watches everything you do and he has mad secrets about the government that are so powerful he had to run and take sanctuary in Russia. There's a whole movie about it and probably lots of documentaries.
when i get more subs then can we do a i dare you
But maybe I did skip to the end...?

Conspiracies proven true : Operation Northwoods, Mk-Ultra, The Tuskegee Experiment, Iran Contra Affair, Enron, RICO cases, Bayer using blood with AIDS knowingly in medicine, pharma companies paying doctors to write favorable papers on drugs possibly even ghostwriting? Operation Blue Beam not necessarily proven true?
plz would u make more parkourse
They're forcing paper straws when the US isn't even the problem.  It's all virtue signaling and will literally make no impact on the problem.

Dear Ryan, what anime are u watching now that naruto ended
Random things are interesting too, it gives you things to think about. I didn't skip to the end but I should watch these earlier. Is there a point in your lives when you had to take a decision and you still think sometimes about it, "what if" you would have gone another route? Or if you still think about a decision like "damn, I am so happy I made that one decision"?

Maybe the straw is like, you do 20% to solve 80% of the problem. Like giving the effort to maybe a simple things yet can give a really big impact. Like a paretto rule or something.

I work in a restaurant in NYC and a couple of months back we were told we're not supposed to give people straws with their drinks. People still asked for them. If they asked, then we did give them, but instead of the plastic ones, we had switched to corn ones. But they are shitty. They bend and break easily. Like bend it once and it pops open/breaks/leaks. Now I just put straws in every drink, people always ask for them anyway. Because there's ice in the glass and who likes ice hitting their teeth?!

Really enjoying these podcasts. In Vancouver, Canada, every household has designated bins provided by the city for composting and recycling. If they find any compost in the garbage you can get a fine! Every since this got implemented, it's almost intuitive to compost, and when I don't compost I feel bad

Here's a conspiracy theory I have heard from my mom, back in Romania: my mom is now in her 60s. Back in 70s or 80s before she had me, she had diabetes. She found this doctor who was mostly employed by the military, and had his own little lab, who actually made small batches of medicine. He gave her some unnamed pills that were not on the market, made by him probably, and cured her diabetes. Once she knew the pills had worked, she wanted to go back to him and ask to help her mom as well (my grandma was more serious, and given that she was older she didn't want to test that on her first), but only to find out that he suddenly died a couple of months after she had visited him. Keep in mind, back then Romania was still communist. Boy, does my mom have the best stories from back then. Wanna hear one more? (I feel like I lived in the communism though I was born right after it got abolished) Countryside Romania. A neighbor's wife walks to the Tuesday farmers market in a different village to sell their produce. She vanishes that day. No one saw her at the market, and she never came back home. Of course, the biggest rumor was that she ran away with another man. But shortly after the husband disappears too, only to be seen a few years later. Turns out the government kinda kidnapped him and tortured him by pulling out all his teeth one by one in hopes that he would confess murdering his wife. He never confessed anything. To keep him from telling people what they had done to him, they sent him to work as a cook for the military, far from home where no one would know him or gave a f about his story.
I have a question to Off the pill podcast, first of all it's an amazing podcast with good supjects you take op:), do you like watching youtubers like Maxmoefoe, Howtobacis, Filthy Frank who is very controversial in their videos with really black humor, is those youtubers someboy you guys will watch?

Straws are such a small part of our trash. It's definitely not significant and for people that buy metal straws and then lose them, you're emitting more greenhouse gases than someone who used a plastic straw. The materials most important to recycle (in terms of their environmental impact) is aluminum cans, cardboard, PET plastic, HDPE plastic, and cans. Everything else is a little harder to find markets and the avoided energy and greenhouse gas emissions are lower. Last bit of advice, if you're not sure you can recycle it where you live (every municipality has their own recycling program), then don't recycle it. Wishful recycling contaminates the recyclables and makes it harder to recycle.
can confirm saving plastic bags is an asian thing
Didnt skip to da end
“I didn’t skip to the end and I am a real one” What is it like paying your friends/getting paid by your friend? Does the salary varies with the YouTube revenue? If so, does it feel weird to pay your friends less?

Ryan, People like scary movies because fear originates an organic reaction that releases adrenaline in your body. The thing with adrenaline is that even though it is originally related to fear and survival, the impression is so strong that it turns into something that is rather giving pleasure and therefore you want to experience it again. Also adrenaline causes any psychological impression to become very engraved in your psychology as a recall. Like one ordinary experience that involves adrenaline is obiously going to cause the impact and need of repetitiion that you would need from 10 ordinary pleasant situations. Thats why it is also hard for people to overcome bad experiences.....

If you can't handle public glass/glass due to  hygiene then don't even at at the place. Just sip it directly from the cup/glass u won't die

Each member of the RHPC gotta be in at least one podcast! "I din't skip to the end"
My favourite horror movie is Ryan and Sean's not-so-excellent adventure

If I dont need a straw I just dont use any straw at all. Avoid as much as I can.
But in cases like Milk Tea, etc. if possible to bring own tumbler and metal straw :D

on the straw thing--  a few places I go are now using straws made out of corn husks and they actually work like plastic but they are all biodegradable and a great alternative but for some reason they haven't become popular when they're not only more functional than paper straws but they're even better for the environment
this was so interesting that i didn't even skip to the end

I hate his podcasts
Look up Dr.Sebi
Hey Ryan, I'm curious what your thoughts are on late night shows garnering massive fanbases through the internet and/or YouTube. It seems like a lot of television producers and executives are increasingly valuing popularity on platforms like YouTube (ex: Conan's new format, iiSuperwomanii getting a late night show, Patriot Act). It used to seem like YouTubers were often trying to get on to television, and not the other way around. As an OG of YouTube comedy, what do you think about this change, if it does exist?

In Australia it’s become a law where a lot of grocery stores and markets ban plastic bags, so you have to bring in your own or pay for a bag. At first people complained but a few months later everyone’s taken the initiative to bring in their own reusable bags and you hardly see much plastic bag waste now a days. In the end it all worked out and there’s a lot less plastic bag waste.
Arden: "we're both old school"
Paco: "you can take out school, you're both old"

Paco was representing all of us crushing over Ryan and Arden’s relationship 😅😁
"Purple elephants......are coming for you" -Arden Cho
The whole thing is Arden complimenting Ryan and Ryan just 😐 lol
I was checking the cast of Teen Wolf
Arden Cho: Birth:16thAugust,1985
                    Height:163cm
                    Lover:NigaHiga

I edited my comment so the replies make no sense
Purple elephants

1:16:57 Woah I heard Ryan curse... I’ll never see him the same way
Not gonna lie, this podcast made me hyped! I was a fan of arden the moment she appeared on teen wolf. And ofcourse everyone loves ryan, so them finally confirming their status has me thrilled. I love seeing the dynamics of their relationship. It actually reminded me much of my best friend and I's relationship (although its platonic rather than romantic). Hope to see more of these two! 😊
56:07 
Ryan: That's what I think about you all the time xD
Paco, don't be anxious, I like your presence in the podcast even if you don't speak.
Ryan and Arden argue like an old married couple 



Purple elephant

Arden: Ryan works 365 days out of a year.
Ryan: Not today~
Paco: ???
Paco: this IS work!!!!
Haha I’ve been hoping for Ryan and Arden to be together since forever so it was interesting to hear about their relationship advice etc.

Also... purple elephants (are coming) 🐘
Ryan, be proud dude. Arden likes you so much that she had to say that you were just a guy, Daaang I mean, its a psychological thing to cover up true feelings... or well.... thats what my impression is. Cheeeers :D
Purple elephants...
Are coming for you 😂
There's a Netflix show where the guy is younger than the girl in the relationship and they work through it. It's called Something in the Rain

edit: Purple elephants are coming for you
Dude they're so like an old couple. She keeps interrupting him and he just listens but they're so in luubb 😂❤
Where is the person that always makes a list of time stamps in the comments?! Your like my best friend come back!
Ryan is my spirit animal. Homebodies for life




Purple Elephants
Omg i cant believe that this actually happened am i dreaming. this brings me back memories 5 years ago when i used to ship them  but i really wanted them to be together and it happened im shook my life is shook what is life am i dreaming

PURPLE ELEPHANTS ARE COMING FOR YOU
Lol seeing the three of you guys in this podcast reminds me of my relationship with 2 of my best friends who love each other same way ryan and arden do, and I’m paco 😂
42:20 Arden: I wanna do more fun things ;))
Arden: Ryan and I are both old-school

Arden is a low-key big sis figure for Paco.

I  genuinely love how he said it so casually like it’s nothing like he doesn’t care at all it’s just who he is💕
I can relate so much to ryan in this video

Hey guess what my favourite animal is.








Purple Elephants. (If you know what I am talking about then like)
It was definitely a unique experience seeing two people who love each other talking about their more realistic love....
Also I really don't know what crossed Arden's mind with Purple Elephant ;)
Arden: Back then, I wanted to get married and have like 500 kids...
Ryan: 500??!!

Never realized how smooth and silky Arden's voice is.   Could listen to her talk for hours.

Wow roasting and fishing. Phew
Paco was literally third-wheeling the whole time.

I've been such a huge fan of Arden since A.S.S. This podcast was one of my favorites.
Purple elephants !!!
uhh, no purple elephants for me😌😌
Asian couples are awesome ❤
The kind of relationship everyone strives to be in... Their relationship is so mature and understanding? It's refreshing to see two people in an actual healthy relationship... ya'll are  goals. 


Oh yeah, also, purple elephants are coming for you.
My heart:*pumps*
Butthurt people:Are you making fun of dead people?
DANGER

Purple Elephants are coming for youuu
I rarely watch more than 1-hour videos on YouTube but I really enjoyed watching this until the end! Shout out to those purple elephants. 😆 It is great to learn more long-distance relationship tips especially I'm in one, I'm here in the Philippines and my boyfriend is in California, so it is really hard. But we are making it work and hey, we're already 4 years and counting! ❤ Anyway, thank you for this and more power to you, Ryan and Arden! 😊💕 and also to Paco, you'll be with the one for you soon. 🙏

PS, I love emojis! I feel like my messages are bland without emojis. 😅😆
ardens voice is so soothing omg i love her
I think we don't say that enough but Paco is awesome. Thanks Paco, even if you blew every table cloth tricks...
I almost forget that ...Purple Elephant

Arden: “should I tell them about our super romantic date last week?”

Paco: OR TELL THEM THE STEAK STORY OOH
Paco is third wheeling it hard😂
I feel like I'm very much like Ryan and Arden combined lmao definitely more logical and always in the stand point of how to just keep moving forward but also compassionate.... for a short period but then get over it. Hahahaha.
I think im supposed to say eurple plephent.
Also I have found that me and ryan are not too different XD, who would have thunk.

Why does Arden Cho look like the female  version of a professional league of legends gamer named "Biofrost"? 


Look him up and see for yourselves, lol i wonder if they're related?
Oh snap, didn't know she's from Dallas! Sweet
I love how they pretty much spent 2 years not even mentioning the relationship and now it’s a free for all 😂

And the most important thing that your long distance relationship always works, is because you two are genuine to each other, truly treasure each other. Yes you two are old - old generous and big hearts unlike the new generation with the online swiping culture. Love you two <3 ^^

If you wanna have lucid dreams cut day dreaming. If you live your life sleeping then when you go to bet you continue sleeping. If you live with attention then you go to bed and continue applying that attention during sleep time. Cheers!

I remember seeing Arden Cho at church when I was in college, and I couldn't even say hi even though I wanted to tell her I was a fan and wanted to take a picture with her because I was so shy. But I just watched her walk in the parking lot LOL. It was such a long time ago. I can't believe they are dating. Anyways such a cute couple <3
Purple elephant! ❤️
Paco i feel you, dude. Surrounded by the couples and when they became lovey dovey you just wanna barf LOL 

Anyway i’m glad to see that Ryden are both mature people that take their relationship seriously! Hopefully will see em together with 5 kids

Purple Elephants, are coming for you.. hihihihi
Trying to catch up...Arden is awesome at keeping the convo going, which made this episode so great! (Also I love that it made the guys cringe a lot when when she calls them out.😂🤣😅) I’m actually going to have my hubby listen at around 56 mins to explain the logic and compassion bit, because it’s sooo true! A lot of our arguments happen cuz of that difference. 

Shout out to Chewie, who is so very cute! 

PURPLE ELEPHANTS ARE COMING FOR YOU!
I love Chewy, I think you are spot on about the acting stereotype regarding who can play what character with specific ethnicity, and Korean has to be one of the most beautiful sounding languages I've heard. Arden your eyes are BEAUTIFUL, and... Purple Elephants
Hi Arden Chay 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ㅋㅋㅋ
47:21 omg he's cuuuutteee .. I'm crushing on him right now

Purple Elephant 05/05/2019
Purple elephants are coming for you...
Am I the only one who was surprised Ryan dropped an F-bomb near the end? Sounded unnatural :o
I started watching Ryan's videos 4/5 years ago and I cannot believe here I am, watching him talk about relationship issues. like wow, he's all grown up. hahahahaha
Purple elephants are coming for you...

Please have another podcast with Arden. I honestly loved learning more about Ryan in this video because he may seem all fun and outgoing in his videos but I love knowing he's more shy, has a small friend group and loves being at home (SAME).
purple elephants🤫
Bring Arden back again!!! :)
Purple elephants
Purple elephants

Purple elephants r coming for youuuuuuu heheheh
Purple elephants
Purple Elephants
PURPLE ELEPHANTS
Cooking, But Not Really:
Ryan makes dinner for Arden.
(food at least)
i just remembered
Arden's voice reminds me of Lola bunny in the 2011 loony toons
"It says my name..." 
I thought you couldn't read in your dreams...
We love you Paco
Have arden and ryan rlly not kissed or am i being played? Bc im feeling kinda dumb rn😂😂
57:23
Ryan: Okay. I never said it like that.
His facial expression straight after shows instant regret 😂
Purple Elephants
I'm glad I've purple-elephanted though a little late.

You talked more about the watches than your actual sponsor 😂
Purple elephants ;)
Wanted to comment, 1st off the pill podcast to hit the 1M views but it's probably not true
I can't believe the purple elephants are coming for you! I wonder if their hArden'd tusks will Paco punch :P Well either way Ry an ready for them! :D
Okay but Arden Cho has a really good ASMR voice tho haha. 
Purple Elephants!

Purple elephants 💜
Purple elephants 💜

Paco "BYUNTAE"

A week later and some purple elephants are still coming to get you
Are u guys talking about 2v2 because that is real fun.
nobody:
arden: purple elephants are coming for you
Anyone else slightly bothered that he's saying "Actor" rather than "Actress" for Arden lol
A: Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
me: the purple ones?
A: wait wha-
me: they're coming for us
A: what?!
I'm exactly like Ryan with the solution rather than just compassion thing (and I'm a girl)! I think many people misunderstand it for not having compassion, but it's partly because only showing compassion doesn't work for me, but mostly because I do have empathy for others and I want to help them the best way I can!
Purple elephant are coming for you
Whoah this off the pill title was kind of shocking considering the participants LOL!
Purple elephant are coming for you

Purple elephants :)
man paco really listens during these off the pill podcasts. he's like a better version of alexa
I started to watch Teen Wolf just to see Arden acting! finally found her! Kira is so funny! Ryan, your girlfriend is a great actress!
I was really confused about why people were commenting "purple elephants" but now i can say, purple elephants.
arden looks like a sexy cat - meow
56:30 Is actually proven to be due to differences in the male and female brains.
Been shipping this couple since ASS but I didn’t know they’re really dating. Low key jealous since I’m forever alone and purple elephant 😂😂
For characters that are original, there's more freedom for casting. But i just don't like when preexisting characters that fans have fallen in love with are then cast in ways that dont do the characters justice. Like characters that have consistently looked a certain way should be played by actors that look the part, even down to the hairstyle and eye color. Give them contacts or dye their hair, but fans want to see the character they love.
purple elephants XD
I wanted those Purple elephants!
Has anybody else notice the moving cat looking thing behind Ryan?
1:16:57 I love how Ryan stutters before using the f word like he's scared of saying it. It really shows that he's still the innocent guy we've known for years. Purple Elephants!

Stop searching for the shane dawson time stamp and listen to the whole thing! Such a good podcast! 🤗
Ryan, dude, the Nutcracker is a ballet by the famous Russian composer Tchaikovsky.  That's the first thing you should think of when hearing "nutcracker" if you ever wanna act posh
16:35 Shane Dawson controversy talk :)
Waiting for Ryan Tries Ghost Hunting part 2
If  we’re bringing back dead series: SPY-FALL!!!
Dear Ryan, you should have ur sponsors promo showing up on the bottome left or right in every frame so sponsors would have more airtime. And put offthepill logo on a corner tooo. I enjoy ur podcasts keep doing what you love po.
That is not the smartest combination of phrases in the title...
"Age of consent" and "How Ryan met Arden" 😂😂
they should start doing stuff like this on twitch so we can dono and stuff lol
Its kinda sad how Ryan can't compete with people who uploads daily because of the new youtube algorithm. Ryan deserves to have more exposure and subs!
I actually love off the pill podcast because the people who first started watching Ryan grew up and kinda stopped watching his videos and now this is a new way to watch and connect with him
If you got the notification from before it was deleted, you have a veteran’s discount.
Can we plz get KevJumba on the show?!? We’d love to hear how he’s doing!!
bruh with the sidemen pls do a parkourse!
would yall discuss about the Seungri Scandal?
I think it would be a good idea if Ryan added timestamps to these videos on the different topics covered in the title and video bc I don't have an hour to watch the full video lol
Anyone just waiting for the time stamps in the comments 😂😂
Can we have a talk about mental health and that type of stuff in the next one please. I love hearing you adress social issues. Thanks

NUTCRACKER IS A BALLET, NOT A MUSICAL, REEEEE

Dear Ryan, your dad sounds awesome, please have him on your podcast!
When Will picked up the mug I thought...
Is Ryan making his own Mug club?
I thought all podcasts were boring until this one came along
They amount of people reminding us of the 1st upload makes me feel like seeing the 1st upload isn't that special.
Do a collab with mister pie!
I wear crocs, though... cause I'm a holesome person you know?


 - Paco 2019
Why is this a re upload
HOLD UP! Dtrix and Monica dated??!? Danggggg. I can't see that.

But aww Will was so sweet to call Dtrix to "ask for permission". I like Will.
Who else liked before watching? 🙆‍♀️🙋‍♀️
Song for the Off the Pill mugs
Co-Co-Co-Co----Ffee mugs!!!!
hey ryan, i hope daina could be your next guest, the underated member of RHPC. You guys could talk about how she make all those costum and how does it feel to be the only girl in the RHPC, thanks
Ryan + Loves Fighting Sports = Goku
OG will knows that this is a reupload
ahhh i totally love this podcast! I love all the guests and stuff changing with each podcast, but listening to these 3 is still my most favourite.
I've been watching Ryan since the beginning and now he has a podcast and it's so great. Ryan is a perfect host for a podcast, and you hardly see Hawaii/Asian representatives in the podcast world. It's nice to get that other perspective
you guys should run with being 4'5" so that when people see you in public you come across as GIANTS
57:09 paco “aye where Ryan?”
Ryan taking the question serious “ text me dude I’ll lyk” 🤣😭😭
HE ACTUALLY GOT A SPONSORSHIP
"Innocent until proven guilty"

A phrase the US seems to ignore
I don’t know why people don’t watch this
It’s amazing!
The view point if the video makes you think that is long
Watching Ryan's podcast cheers me up everytime Im down
That was really good. Loved Arden being on there. I could see her being a regular on your podcast.
Do a sidemen vs RHPC basketball match
Paco is an I N T E L L E C T U A L
These dude bros are so dude bro that they all took a moment to laugh because someone said penis. Love this channel.
Glad I didn’t waste my quality comment on that first upload
Dear Ryan,
Can you do a pun dub of the sixteenth opening of naruto, silhouette?
You guys got me all hyped up. I tweeted offthepill to have Rhett and Link when they announced their tour and now you also acknowledged it!
Please have them as guests, it would be my fav colab of all time as you guys are my fav youtubers
Age is just a number
Cat is just a species
Do parkourse with ksi!!!
Anybody else watched it when it first came out?
I farted 


I don’t know why I am making a comment on this but I felt like doing it anyway
I'm gonna be honest, I was pissed when you didn't do Hamilton.
Paco keeps impressing me with how genuinely sharp and insightful he is. not that i thought he wouldn't be (i didn't really have a fully formed opinion on him, i just saw him as a funny, zany ass weirdo xD) but his intelligence and forward way of thinking are really shining in these podcasts.
also, i completely, wholeheartedly agree with what he said (& Ryan & Will supported) on how people who've had a 'problematic past' but then changed significantly for the better should be praised and given positive reinforcement instead of being forever condemned and punished for their past mistakes, which they acknowledged and grew from. that type of behavior should definitely be supported and praised because it encourages not only honesty but promotes self-awareness, healthy self-criticism and personal growth. and like Paco said, it really does take a lot of moral reevaluation and a profound shift in one's beliefs and principles to so openly admit to one's mistakes and the wrongness of their past mentality and show vulnerability while at the same time showing pride in your progress and growth and using it to inspire others as well. it's important for society that we motivate and support the willingness and process of changing in a positive way, otherwise no one will ever want to take the step to change their ways when they know they'll still always be met with rejection, judgement, shunning and general disdain.
anyway, once again, awesome podcast guys! this is slowly becoming one of my favorite things to watch/listen to on YT.
i love it. :)
How I think I sound like singing: JR Aquino
How I actually sound like: Will
Ryan should collab with his old og YouTube friends like PewDiePie
Did you guys notice the intro of some collected clips?

PACO: How did you and Arden meet?
WILL: We just kind of....
RYAN: MADE OUT?

lol hahaha
Every time you guys say you have a sponser...a little dad tear runs down my face. 

Proud of you guys!
Seat Geek is the Sponsor Eagle of the nigahiga channel
Still looking for the hero with the timestamps :(
I think you should make a different channel for your podcast. I feel like you may replace your actual videos with the podcast and upload once every 5 months.
"The internets amazing" 
😅😂
On the next episode can you talk about relationships on cheating and trust. Or just stories you have about relationships. Like real life lesson OG story’s😂 also love you guys

WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH YOUTUBE?!
RyArden







I'll let myself out
Of the pill, i think it was a vlog before (not sure) to a podcast
BgA performances
Skits
Talk (discuss with your audience too)
Weird stuff
You could do these things 😂
You a real g if you know this was a reupload
Yo, I've been a long-time subscriber, and I've heard a lot of different unpopular opinions from Ryan, none of which offended me. But when he started talking about musicals and it having a cult following, it lowkey made me want to grab some sleeves.
But then I put a little more thought into it, and it was like "He's lowkey right too, though." lol
Nutcracker is a ballet to the music of Russian composer Tschaikovsky
The original Nutcracker was a play in 1892. I also saw it as a kid like Will when I was about 7 or 8. YES, I hope Arden will be on, Love her!!!
Waiting for ryden ship to sail forever😊😊😊😊😊
You guys should do live podcasts, if you are thinking of traveling and doing shows. I'm sure a lot of people would love to go and relax and listen to off the pill live.
"I'm not a player, I just crush a lot" - Paco 2019
RyArden







I'll let myself out
This is the only podcast I watch and I love it bc it's you. Keep being real💚
is it just me that absolutely loved Wildcard? I thought the dynamic with Paco and Derrick was hilarious. If not, Paco needs way more screen time!
Finally, interview everyone wants to see next Sunday!!!
Nobody: 
Ryan: in Hawaii—
Bring back games like spy fall and mafia!
Been Ryan's big fan for years... and didnt fckin know Will was dating Monica..... 😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😂😂
I'm just going to say, regarding the white supremacist tattoo artist scenario(?), that man is using his platform for good and ACTIVELY showing remorse for his past. so I disagree with Ryan. I don't think that can be compared to other controversial people. Yes, people change, but there's a difference between learning and letting go vs learning and showing that you've improved.
Sean and Ryan vs the Paul Brothers
Mind blown. Literal facts are spitted out every minute. 🤯 Love how you guys interpret things!
They should of used the first half of his name for the promo code
Bappo is a PIMP




And.... he SLAPPPS HOeS
This podcast keeps me alive pls never stop
Cat: *Exists*

Shane Dawson: It's free real estate
Ryan : So Paco how did u met ur gf 

Paco: Hahaha 😂😂😂 
Cool moment
Do a parkourse with sidemen
if Ryan's father is dumb at technology,how did he watch/listen to Off The Pill podcast?🤔🤔
8:53 Paco’s face!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought Arden would be in the vid 😂
Why not just end the podcast with the favorable classic ending...


 TEEHEE
So how tall actually Ryan? I mean I'm 5 7"
Could you put plastic wrap over the microphones where it will still catch the sound but not be damaged by the outro?

Edit: or like a plastic shield in front of the mic?
Holy moly I've haven't watch this guy for 10 years 
 24 years old now
Wow times pass
Early squad like here
20:58
Ryan's brain: "You are making things worst Paco!"
can you do a ball of lame i dare you where all the winners play
Ryan’s way of unplugging his merch. I don’t care just say it and carry on with your video dude
Hi Ryan! I love you so muchhhh! I have watched you since the beginning and I of course love the crew!
Who else clicked to know how Ryan meet Arden...?
Yeah~~~ I missed TEEHEE time SOOOOOOOOO much oh boy~ =3=
Can't wait for the Sidemen collab!!!
LETS GO OVER ON JOES CHANNEL/TWITTER AND TELL HIM TO HAVE RYAN ON
paco: "...ryden..."
cues northern downpour music
Dear Ryan
Do you like Boruto? WHY!!?/ why not?
"I'm not a player, I just crush a lot" well, paco..
Hope you get a better sponsor cuz I already used le code for seatgeek like one for a game XD
Do a parkourse with KSI/ sidemen!
Good Evening! We only have less than 2 hours to do our task. PLEASE,  
Help us and leave a heart reaction to the post linked. May God bless you
 for helping the people, like us, in need.

Link to the post:

@t
THANK YOU FOR THE SEATGEEK PROMO CODE <3
When they said Shane, I thought they meant Shayne Topp.
Rip- will and Greg show 😭
well, if SeatGeek sponsors David Dobrik, I'm sure they can sponsor IDY
Yes, certainly need sponsors for your podcasts. 
Your podcast auto downloads to my app. No ads on them unless you manually read the ads in audio.
I'm not very good at explaining things.
Dear Ryan,
What if your podcast was ON the pill?
you guys look thinner this time. 
>I can hear all those worried grandma
This is one of my favorite off the pills yet. Good job guys.
Only the real og's saw the video the first time it uploaded!💗
I just came here to say: All these podcast thumbnails are hilariously similar. Lol. That is all. K, bye. 🤗
Honestly loving the podcast. I want the mug!!!
They should make these live streams so they can talk with us as well 👍
You guys should collab with pewds. He will quess in your podcast. Ryan and pewds will review memes together 😄
It's so sad that Ryan has to be so cautious when uploading a video - this video was taken down at first. Then again, I do believe he is going in the right direction, what with these podcasts and other types of videos he actually enjoys making.
aw man I have five hours of podcasts to catch up on
I think the most effective way for Ryan to be a stand up comedian is if he does it like Bo Burnham style
damn wtf is parkourse rly that old?
Shane and Ryan collab? You know what happens when Ryan tries to be serious and spooky....
I definitely agree about the bar thing
"the new mug ...get it now?" *looks at Ryan*lol
Hey you wonderful people reading this. Have an amazing rest of the day and follow your dreams!
I enjoy these podcasts because it's perfect for when I'm up late at night doing homework and I need something interesting to listen to
I luv Shane, I know his comedy.
Though, when I used to watch the podcast, I remember he explained it was a joke and it was an unused sketch, but apparently not?
21:48 
Ryan: they use to say that to you

Paco: thanks man😑
Paco seriously dropped the ball on that soon-to-be-18y/o girl. Shoulda just waited that one week. 😂
by how much ryan goes "what is that?" to common topics makes it hard to believe he's not actually a 60 yr old man
As a ballet dancer, you saying Nutcracker is a musical hurt my soul. They're so different!!!
please, make your voice bigger, its hard for me to hear what you're  saying without any speaker (im not joking)
Wait... Ryan is NOT a watch guy...take it off!
Will, the Nutcracker is a classical ballet not a musical 😂😂👏🏼👏🏼
I have to say, I was just looking through your channel to see if there were any new uploads other than this podcast. I've been a fan for a long time and I didn't rlly like Off the Pill at first because it wasn' the content I was used to. But I stumbled upon this video looking for podcasts to listen to while doing my homework and you guys are really clever and entertaining, and I'm gonna keep on listening!
Reupload 👉🏻👈🏻
Paco is genuinely one of my favourite people!!!!!
i love it when the podcast is just RHPC bc you can really see your dynamics, but having said that i cant wait for arden's episode!!!!
Good job Paco, you reeled in your outbursts and became a much better component of the podcast. I respect improvement.
I have been watching this dude since the beginning =O It's been a long time.
i'm a fan from Malaysia

thank you for subscribing
AirPod Conspiracy video
wow guys u are amazing !!  I love your minds and the way u think especially when "paco" start talking at 25:54  keep up the good work!
I GOT A FRIEND YOU CAN/SHOULD PRANK
We still love you Ryan, dont be too pressured in always trying to create those high quality videos 💕
Do an I dare you live show with seat geek where the fans make dares
You posted this while i was watching the last skitzo
Everyone commenting about how the episode was reuploaded and I am just hyped that Arden will be in the next OTPP!
Please bring KevJumba on the podcast. That would be everything!
When Is The Next Skitzo coming???🤔🤔
I'm actually so surprised that Ryan doesn't know the Nutcracker (the original story by hoffman), though I only know of it as a ballet, not a musical.
Make a RYAN TRIES series please
Yes! Have Rhett and Link on your podcast!!!!!
The peoe who watch these and understand the jokes are true fans!
woah green lighting in the background, nice!
360p squad where you at
Invite Andrew Yang to your show!
I don't have a girlfriend.
And i wear crocs
shane dawson just came on you!
like to undo
1:02:30 ur welcome :>
I love how Will asked Dom for permission before dating Monica
How do these guys still like rice and the pauls? Like i love RHPC but why?
These are always the highlight of my weekend
Ryan Higa is the best Youtuber
I couldn’t keep my eyes from seeing those moving dolls behind Ryan....
im addicted to this podcast now. they have great energy
I like how Ryan’s videos are weird but entertaining.
Clicked on this so fast I broke me hand
Nutcracker is a ballet. I would love to watch it 💖
Definitely do the radio prank call thing!
Found an easter egg for Ryan’s new energy drink at the bottom of the I Dare You trophy! or maybe not..
@nigahiga I would be honored if you'd be able to prank call my sister. Love your vids dude.
Man, I always enjoy your videos. You post some incredible stuff. 

PS, My iNavigator still works

Edit: Wow, thanks to the ones who have been subscribing!
That design is actually pretty good
Can you go back to making usual videos or bring back skitso we love those
What has happened to all the skits? its just episodes now ;-;
Who was here for the first upload?
Im loving OTP 💊 👀 keep it up guys
What makes his wrestling rant with jake paul or logan is cuz if people didnt know, Ryan use to wrestle back in his old days.
Love your podcast 💕
Hey I’m kinda early and I love the podcasts!!
yeet

Edit: I had to make the y lowercase to be cooler
I subbed to ryan back in 2007.  I stayed subbed to him mostly out of nostalgia, and I gradually found myself not watching most of his videos.  But, ever since his change in direction, I found myself watching every video since.
love the lighting guys. that nice green/blue/purple lighting really is easy on the eyes.
BgA concert when?
Great show!❤👍👏
IP man is amazing
Can you bring back skitzo
25:13 I think Shane misspoke here.  A person who was formerly a white supremacist and then learned the error of their ways does by no means deserve praise.  Being not racist is the standard, it should be expected of everybody.  Praise is reserved for people who go above and beyond.  However, I do think that hypothetical person should be FORGIVEN.  They are sorry for their past thoughts/actions, and those thoughts/actions no longer define them.


Just my two cents :)
Yo musicals irl was great
The part where will hunts the princesses 😂
I like the way will talks, its so soft  :')
Do more ghost hunting...that shit was scary af
Finally paco step up, I was waiting like forever.
dear Ryan, could you talk about article 13 (actually 17 now) that's just been approved in EU in your next podcast?
Enjoyed this podcast
Best diss of 2019??? Stans, lets get him
paco is so funny sdhdsh (with ricegum's 3 supreme jeans lmaoo)
Thanks for featuring my question, Ryan! You know, from IG
if your 4,5 im taller 4,6 Biaach
Hyperx cloud revolver headsets are awesome
YASSS MORE PARKOURSE
Request: make a timestamp in the description.
Wooo. I was 10 minutes in before I realized why this sounded so familiar
I love the colours!
Paco quote of the year: "I like hurting people."
my friend was about 4ft tall but he was a 6th grader




edit
Why was this reposted? Btw if you (Ryan) would answer me it would make my day!
He jokes when he says he is 4'5 right? lol
When 50% of the comments are about the reupload. Including this one.
Nooo, dont cancel the show!
fact : Ryan's room bigger than my room....
Talk about mma Ryan!!
Is it me or is Ryan’s voice oddly higher than usual in this video...? 😂😂
when you having your drink come out
I'm loving these podcasts! I'll be honest, even though I've been subscribed for probably a decade, I haven't kept up with the videos as much in recent years because my interests just changed. These are nice because it feels like reconnecting with a childhood friend :)
Was waiting for the re-upload because i missed it the first time 😢
Don't tempt me, Paco.  I would date you SO HARD if you were really into guys.
57:55 Paco, if you want to be known by your own name then try not to do comedy that is a subconscious imitation of Ryan - not only in terms of the sequence of events in his comedy or the way he speaks, but also his skitzo characters or multiple characters that appear in many of your videos as well. He had ADD, but you didn't. Now, his ADD worked to his full advantage. You didn't have ADD (which is good), so cherish yourself as your original person and not just measure yourself in terms of success. 

So what if Ryan's friends are often recognized by his name. Enjoy that. Enjoy life. Success does not come by obsessing after it, but may come when you are enjoying life and are comfortable with who you are.
Subtitle please??? I am not good at listening 😅😅
I look at will with that hoodie and coffee I feel cold, then they switch to Ryan who's wearing this bare tee. What's the temp in there ya'll??
Did you delete the first one I got a notification again
Do a roblox gameplay
The first channel I subscribed two on this account and I created this account in 4 years ago
Do parkourse with an actual parkour guy
I was here for the re-upload
I think that if a minor lied about their age, it should be handled as it would be if they committed another crime with either them, depending on their age, or their parents receiving the consequences.
Yall never heard of The Nutcracker and Wicked 😂
Ayyy my question was asked ^.^
Can I get a golden ticket from seat geek?
Gotta love the need to re-upload the video, 10 minutes after original upload
nice lighting boys, keep up the good work
“I wear crocs though so it protects my virginity” this is why I love paco
Dear Ryan,
can you shave your head?
Ryan being completely unaware of Wicked and the Nutcracker being real things was hilarious.
What weight class was Ryan in for wrestling? I know he mentioned it in an old vid or something but I can't remember
Do a cooking but not really for ksi to eat and then do a podcast with him.
Ryan if you are going to the 🇵🇭 here some tips of speekingbin Tagalog 
Ano : what
Bakit : why
Salamat : thank you
Mabuhay : hello
Magandang umaga : good morning
Paco's twitch please, love him.
Bro ryan bring celebs in because none of these topics are really getting me to watch the whole video
Romeo Lacoste stuff: I mean in Romeo's case, he was very clearly wrong. He knew the girls were underage, and even if he didn't know, he was very manipulative to them, saying that they were his biggest fan and that he only replies to her, etc. Spill has a good video on it (it's like 30 minutes long tho I think).
However, I think if the older partner can prove they didn't know/the underage partner says that the older partner didn't know they were underage, then the older partner can't be punished for being with an underage person (they can be punished for being abusive or something just not for being a pedophile or something). Obviously, unless it's very obvious that the younger person is underage.
The bar also would be at fault in the situation Ryan described. In the bar, it's safe to assume everyone inside it is 21+ because the bar is responsible for letting in only people older than 21. If someone's using a fake ID they should get in trouble for that, even if they told the older partner they're underage.
Dear Ryan 
Can you make a Tokyo ghoul parody
Omg those action figures. I never saw them before!
Thank you Paco for asking the questions the fans want to know 😂😂
Love these guys and the podcast it’s awesome to hear your thoughts, and opinions. Giving us a better idea of who you guys are, and just answering so many questions we’ve had as fans. To also just feel closer which is awesome
YESSS I LOVE THESE!
stop making these trash vids and go back to stuff from 2018
still after all these years i cant believe ure getting away with calling urself nigahiga😂😂
You guys talking about musicals made my week 😂😂😂
1:06:55 I wonder if Ryan is talking about the Steve Harvey Morning Show because they do that exact thing
This Channel makes me like podcasts
Re upload?
Ryan I’ll be down to see you and your friends play basketball.
I miss the old ryan video .
pewdiepie vs t series




how bout pull ryan up to nigahiga vs pewdiepie+t series :>
hahaha he broke his ankles playing basketball. came on ryan who was it
okay so i just realized that each person has a colored light in the back, and i think its so cool.
Can't wait for Arden in this podcast 😭😭😭 why am i crying lol
These podcasts own!
Real fans know this is a re-upload :)
RHPC x SIDEMEN 🔥
...reupload?
140 pounds is a big number!!!
yes, I thought it was a big room until I saw it in one of the bts videos on the other channel and I honestly was suprised
ive gotten both my panic!at the disco concert tickets and my twenty one pilot tickets from seat geek :D
the thing about the tweets is a law in some countries
You r an of if u know this was reuploaded
LOL Nutcracker is a ballet not a musical
Why did this get re-uploaded?
Ryan I have some idea for you in podcast
Will, being that your on YouTube you should interview Animal Trainers and host shows for Animal Planet.
no ads on your video ?🤔
Dear Ryan can you make how to sing like your favorite artist part 3
It's crazy cus I remember watching Arden on Teen Wolf and Ryan's videos and when I found out they were together, I was a little mind blown
Let Ryan talk about sports!
It’s frustrating how little they know about musicals. I don’t even like musicals but still. 

Love the podcast tho!!!
Will and Dom are a hell of a lot cooler than my ex who started dating my best friend like 3 weeks after we broke up.
Oh man he's losing his subscribers so fast!!!!
Yes the Nutcracker is real.  Its mainstream is usually ballet performance than musical due to the thrilling russian dance in the ballet which is great to watch.  I have never seen a musical version of the Nutcracker but the ballet performance was wonderful.
Invite KSI on your podcast!!!
Real subscribers know this is a reupload💯
The whole should past mistakes be considered even if they have changed reminds me of delphine and paarthunaax
The Romantic Movie collaboration was created 3 years ago, and they got back into touch a little while before that, which means they’ve been together for 2-3 years :-)
I use to think Ryan’s channel was called n!&&@ higa with the two g’s. Oof
Is it me or was this deleted then reuploaded?
I was so confused when I saw the notification then I couldn’t see it
NigaHiga please do more these podcast which require less efforts and less creative
Collab with Ownage Pranks!!
this podcast is fun, three friends having a conversation like this, these three definitely have chemistry
It's sad that Ryan is losing so many subs every second :( OG fans have your back!
Please make the podcast available on Spotify in my country Kuwait
Revive "Cooking But Not Really" series
Could you do episode 10 on twitch too?
get david so comedy and or the just kidding films
 guys in this podcast
Excited for Arden to come on!
Does anyone know if the skits will come back? Or has this channel taken a turn like DavidSo Comedy? Just curious
im sure he actually mentioned it was from a sketch in the podcast but most ppl ignore that fact
best of parkour video please!!!!!!
U guys should definitely ask Rhett and link to come on the podcast
You guys should get pewdiepie and do a crossover with the Misfits(fits and swagger souls, etc.)
nobody:


ryan: ...ANYWAY
Assuming the president is a he Paco!

I’m so offended
No views 79 likes. YouTube is high again 🤣
Do parkourse with the sidemen that would be funny
I did used it for Knotfest and 🤘🤘🤘🤘
no one  has time to see these podcasts so ur not getting much views
Do a prank call but end it with some kind of giveaway!
Can we get the bumblebee dance  squad back please?!😂🙏
in this paco was the wise one.
honestly these podcasts are a$$
Dear Ryan can u have a Pokemon battle tournament with your squad
Wait, wait, how to be ninja is blocked?? One of my favorite videos. That’s how I found Ryan
NO ADS?
how does ryan not know about the Nutcracker??
Whats the Shi Shi Break transition music called?
Why was this video deleted?
Also yay it's on Spotify now
34:06 i wish he pressed the peni$ button.
Watch the stuff you say, it'll really shape your reputation.
I personally would like to see a Ryan Tries Pro Wrestling like WWE kinda stuff lol it would definitely be a fun video and I can already picture him trying to cut a promo and come up with a gimmick lol I think they'd all end up having a blast with that
Sidemen Parkourse!!
Does anyone know why this was reuploaded?
I am so happy Paco joined RHPC
The room looks a lot bigger than it really is
great podcast, Ryan! Very entertaining :)
Put KSI on the podcast!!! (please)
I think the word F-A-G meant the same but as the years pass the political correctness manual was super easy with no racism.
But now it has way too many updates like having a better salary than a woman,racism, spreading legs on public transport and other ridiculous things
Dear Ryan, can you make TikTok videos?
You still friends with Wayne Brady? You should have him on
Do another parkourse episode like a finale so I can have some closure
you uploaded this before and you deleted it. but i’m early for this yayyy!
56:14 Poco: I’m about to end this whole mans career
How has Ryan never heard of the nutcracker
dear ryan, can you make a love story of marley, roku, and chewy?
THIS IS LEGENDARY
Why u keep reuploading my guy?
I feel like Ryan is slowly being annoyed by Paco every time their thoughts conflict with each other
Dear Ryan , Can u please shut the hell(podcasts) up!!!     -
           A  TRUE FAN
Do a cooking but not really for them please
Make a parkourse video with ksi
Every time I see the intro, all I can think of is the Squip lol

Who else agrees?
Do an "in controversial news" segment
If the low lights are for ambiance, I don't hate it 😊
Hey can you sing without using your voice
Ryan's vids make me want to steal a free sample
Do a parkourse with ksi!
should def do a video with the sidemen, also could have JJ or Simon on the podcast
another collab with ksi will be awesome.
Came of prn hb to watch this
Who else knows that this is a reupload
Paco has the most adorable laugh freakin love it!.
LETS GOO PARKOURSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SIDEMEN VS RHPC
Love this podcast.
26:35 We invented a word for that: SIN
These podcasts help me so much getting through studying
Why did this get reuploaded?
NEXT OTP EPISODE IS GONNA HAVE ARDEN AND DAINA...YESSSSSSS
You guys are so cute navigating through that sponsorship shoutout!
Love this show but, Paco talks to much
I cant wait for people to comment "first" after an hour of the video being posted
29:23 what about Ben Carson?
What us "The pill prodcast" ??
Paco is really smart. 🤔
omg you guys should talk about seungri scandal
20:12 exactly what happened with James Gunn, director of Marvel Films Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2, soon-be-3.

He was put under fire shortly after the production and release of GOTG 2 for homophobic comments made on Twitter years before he made it to stardom, and had previously even apologized for his actions to Disney before being hired (I believe.) With the new digging-up of these tweets, he was fired from Disney for director of any further films under the title, and was forced to make an apology publicly, less he lose his reputation any further than already.

Recently, after being pressured, Disney re-hired James Gunn as they also decided it would be good for sales. However, damage was done to both Gunn and his career after his aged comments were dug up from the history books of the internet and cannot be reversed.
People already disliking the vid and they haven’t even watched it
45:39 love dat burp
I have a question, Ryan what happen to movies in minutes? I miss those!
no ads?
welcome! back ryan" how are you,
could we use seat geek for a bga concert
How could they don't know Nutcracker?
I saw the Nutcracker Tom and Jerry Musical episode.
This was....  






Teehee
Honestly, I’ve had friends who have spoken tried legit Middle Aged men and were like 17 /16 and I feel the fault shouldn’t only be pinned on adult like it should be the underaged persons fault too.
Paco is fire here!!! I stan! <3
my 2 cent worth... I would pick the guy that seems most genuine. Changing your life, lifestyle and way of thinking is brave and admitting what you were (white supremacist) is fearless and making a change (altering tattoos) proves that it's not just words but he is taking action and making a change. I guess it all depends on how open minded the  person (voter) is.BTW please watch leaving neverland it will leave you traumatized. After you recover do some research and I think the truth will seem pretty clear. I actually checked your podcasts after watching to get your reaction.
Waiting for next week podcast tho
How does Ryan not know what nutcracker is????
Can someone tell me generally, what was spoken about in the Shane section?
Like, are they talking positively about Shane and supporting him with this stupid cat controversy?
I want to know but my YouTube is playing up and won't let me watch the video 😬
Only podcasts I listen to fully, hopefully u guys get more sponsors, and we dont mind these being monetized
Can you make a song with claps
Your youtube got boring because of the pill podcast
Lol am I the only one who finds it weird not hearing David Dobrik promoting seatgeek but Ryan Higa instead? Love that these guys are sponsored by them too though!
LMAO 1:05:53 paco’s silly “i’m not a player i just crush a lot” and ryan’s just like “yeah....” kinda awkward moment. don’t worry paco i understood that reference
I enjoy these so much! I wish Ryan would've come up with this idea sooner.

27:50 That is because a majority of the people think the people who have changed will go back to being their racist or whatever self they were years ago. And that is what alot of people don't even bat an eyelash towards the people who have put an effort to change. 


Side note: I would LOVE to have a discussion with these 3. They are really entertaining and they have really good points.
Dear Ryan, can you make a video game without scripts?
You should use alexa in this podcasts. She could tell you about nutcracker or something else you are nor familiar with.
You should do a parkourse again!
Can u talk about article 13
RYAN -- PLAY PUBG!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SURE IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS IF YOU PLAY IT..
these podcasts are so deep :D
just waiting for the guy to give me timestamps. Appreciate the work
you should post some videos about your basketball games
Hi  New Subscriber
Best intro ever.
Ryan wrestling jake paul ....take my money
Ryan better stop uploading, deleting, and re-uploading his damn podcasts every. Single. Time
I'm here for the Arden storyline. Timestamp anyone?
I’d love to see some YouTube animators on the podcast
27:43-27:58 NEVER GONNA BE PRESIDENT NOW (only Hamilton fans understand)
I thought I was tripping when I got two notifications
Yaa, i believe paco will be a very good waiter 😆
I love Ryan but I don't think you know how to podcast well.

Bish it's only 9:12pm and I'm knackered, maybe cause I woke up at 5 30 for some ugly as reason 🤦🏻‍♀️
Meow

What is it with them uploading the video then reuploading it
I get such FOMO every time you delete your vid then reupload it 😭
you guys should put time stamps for the topics in the title
Can you do off the pill podcast with bga
man this was a good talk show!.. after a while of listening it started to grow on me .
Shane Dawson just kissed you 




You are a cat
Teehee time is so dead that I forgot what it was and I had to go look it up. 😂 But Parkourse and Cooking But Not Really are like my favorite. I’d love to see those come back.
First of all, I loved this podcast. And for once, I actually watched the whole thing.
My views --
1. You guys spoke about the fact that sexual stuff shouldn't be said to underage girls. Trust me, no girl for that matter even above the age of 18 shouldn't be sent sexual stuff.
the room also looks big because the lighting is different for each person
How Ryan and Arden met 1:02:31
please can we get a ryantries fighting and u guy sall just do u fight
will is so sweet to ask dom for permission
You hear that kids? If there was a candidate for president who used to be a serial killer and acknowledgment, Paco would vote for him.
20/5000
Боб Губка плачет
I saw this when it first came out
Whoooo Ryan was 100% correct, I was about to comment that the Nutcracker is a ballet that originally premiered in 1892
DEAR RYAN - Can you tell us the Origins of 'dear Ryan' ?
Time stamps for the podcast???
I'd love to see Dtrix on the podcast
Bruh who else clicked bout fast asf and went straight to the comments?!😂 you owe me a łíké if u did.

Them talking about the legal age consent and what not reminds me of 69’s case
My comment disappeared... rip comment 2019-2019
Watching this during lunch, these podcasts are surprisingly entertaining
I put it on 1.25x cause they talk slow😃😃
I keep thinking the editor is putting a health bar when Ryan’s name thing comes up
Talking bout Ownage Pranks. That's the awesome prank guy.
Can you do how to be a ninja 3.0
I appreciate the hardcore editing for an hour of footage
Early squad. We love the off the pill podcasts!!!!!
Only now I hear Ryan's Hawaiian accent.
anyone can lead me to the how ryan met arden plz
Actually about that murder thing a man did get released after murdering someone 30 years before and the trial said it was too long ago so they couldn’t do anything
Dear Ryan can you recreate a full version of Bohemian Rhapsody
Shane Dawson: gets married

His cat: :0
Dear Ryan, Can you fly with engines?
Did parthurnax deserve to be slain
lmao can yall do a mukbang "segment"
I watched how to be ninja 1 about a week ago
This is how many people love Ryan
👇🏿
Age of consent in Philippines is 12😫
Remember when Ryan got pranked call by Dave Days...
Are you really off the pill while doing these podcasts?
Did you know this guy use to be #1 youtuber
It would be crazy if you got pewdiepie on an off the pill podcast
Dear Ryan, could you please please please do a collab with the artist Snail Lord...
Ryan should do stand up on tour
Next vid talk about your wrestling career!
Get we get an F in the chat for Shane Dawson’s Cat?
And now we’re all connected- ryan
26:17 Ryan felt existential
actually after 20 years any case (even murder) goes closed iirc
Do a live bodcast
FBI has joined chat.
A L L E G E D L Y
How have you never heard of the nutcracker lol
does ryan still takes his pill before the show ? because lately he looks more focused and on topic on the last few podcast XD
Today's fact: Shaggy from Scooby Doo's real name is Norville Rogers.
“I wear crocs because they protect my virginity..... cause I’m a ‘hole’ som person”


-Paco 2019
Lulz How do i pronounce your name ?
i love these podcasts
Podcasts 😍❤️💎
Should do a podcast with complete silence! Epic idea 😎 
Age of consent

👇🏽
Where is the Shane Dawson part. I don't want to listen to the full hour, anyone know?
Dear Ryan, can you do a vid if your dogs Addams apple got stung by a bee and randomly started smelling like raddish . That or walruses doing karate with or against a piece of tin foil.
Love is love what Shane did is a sexual preference and age of content should be lowered for the Lgbtqp community. P stands for pedosexual
I WAS A JANITOR
You need to join the war against T-series to save Pewdiepie!!
lowkey cooking but not really with ksi
I love the parkourse series
Rhett & Link for Off The Pill while they're in Town
I saw Wicked once.
You are going to dream with James Charles making out with you if you don’t lìkę and süb to me to undo! 🤢
Ryan you should see the Book of Mormon musical. You would absolutely love it!!!
the room definitely looks big
48:20 same paco, same
I am so happy Paco joined RHPC
Obama saying he smoked weed is a huge black mark on his record considering he didnt legalize it.
Those days of nigahiga in 2011, when he was the most subscribed YouTube channel.
That mug! 😍
How did you not know the Nutcracker???!!!! It's only one of the most famous ballets by Tchaikovsky :D
You came for 1:02:35, thank me later
I like the normal video you made i hate this podcast
Yo yo yo
Paco, Will and Ryan, you're so chill, you were born to have a podcast. Please don't kill this show, it gives me happiness.
Still hoping for Kevjumba to come
When you dont have good contents.
Wait. Is this video monetized?
Reuploaded why?
i dont know if you remember my comment on your tweet but i said "@offthepill @KSIOlajidebt, anybody else ship that?" And it might finally happen
Never too late to learn to fight Ryan! Some of the instructors at my gym were cornering someone for their first fight and they were 31. You already have a wrestling base and judo, so that helps you quite a bit. I train in muay thai and boxing and looking to fight at some point.
First
Just finished the podcast
25:23 okay i see what the guys are saying, but what about people who have done major crimes? no matter how much they changed, like per say a former dictator or general who is known for torturing innocent citizens or exploiting them, i think that they should still be held accountable. like how far do we go in accepting change in a person
I won't be able to do timestamps for this one. Just a heads. Sorry.
Why u deleted that one
THEORY: Ryan never ages
Y’all should do Parkour and a podcast with KSI
pacos eyes at 47:21 😂😂 like how
Follow your dreams with passion and persistence ! ;)
yeah ur room looks so big in the podcast videos
Paco looks like troopz
10:47 He is thinking with something else 
WTF paco
Brownie point chasing aside
Should just change age of consent to 15 world wide like alot of other countries do
People start having sex at 15 so you cant really call em kids at that point
Damn Paco going off! get it Paco ^_^!
Views dropping hard
maybe for the radio-ish call idea, you guys could set up an email/use your social media for people to send in voice memos or audio about their question?
Imagine a off the pill live show in front of an audience
parakourse needs to be backkkkkkk
1 hour vid and no ads
I need a Paco in my life to have intellectual conversations
Is it only me, or is the intro "off the pill" jingle too loud compared to the rest of the podcast?
Ryan chad wild clay  roast you
How Ryan met Arden sounds like the name of a rom-com.
Why they deleted this previously and reuploaded it now?
Hey, Ryan. I know your Minecraft video was long in the past, but I was wondering if we could meet up and do a collab together where we both have an hour to get the best stuff (house, materials and more) and see who wins. PM me @galaxylightnin1 (twitter) so we can do this (P.S. I don’t have a computer soooooo, umm)!
Anyone with timestamps?
Get Lily Singh a.k.a Superwoman!
people with white supremacist pasts don't need to be our president period. we don't need to make these type of people our future leaders.
Paco might have a chance to win Parkhourse now that Sean is gone. Sean be killing it!
Yes your room looks bigger
Podcast : waste of time listening to people talking like parrots to distract you from what actually happening .
Geeze you guys (basically just Ryan) need to educate yourselves a little bit on Broadway and classical music
how weird is it that the episodes they were talking about were all recommended to me (the ksi i dare you, the one specific parkourse episode - it was episode 11 that paco was on - the pizzariots cooking but not really and the wild card with arden) lol
Please get Rhett and Link on the podcast. No idea how... but bribery sometimes works.
Please do How To Be Emo 2.0 please
I NEED THAT MUG
PARKOURSE HYPE!!!!
im glad to be first
Off the pill I don't like
this and h3h3 are best podcasts
Hit up ownage pranks
Do a ghost hunting part 2
Will looks so comfortable with that hood on
28:20 that’s sorta what happened with a governors succession line or something
How do ryan and paco not know the nutcracker
Ryan Hoya is the 69th mist subbed youtuber
The nutcracker is a ballet
Purple 🐘 gang!
i can't believe they don't know nutcracker and wicked
Seat geek is pretty good
25:27 Will's mug was never seen again (bottom left)

NO 👏 ONE 👏 CARES👏 THAT 👏 YOU 👏 SAW 👏 THE👏 FIRST 👏 UPLAOAD
The beginning was so misleading ahahah it's like paco was asking will how he met arden

We want daina!!
Please let ryan wrestle jake
This helps me sleep
Cooking but not really!!!
Wtf man is this an Off the pill podcast channel?? Am i at the wrong place???
Reuploaded?
Hey Ryan ik most people would disagree with me on this but could you make more skits? Ik the podcast are cool and all, but we want more dear Ryan’s more funny stuff. Like how to be... I would honestly love to see how to be emo 2.0. It seems like Podcasts is all you do now.
Do dear Ryan please. Dear Ryan how do you get much subscriber's. I love the videos
"She's way out of my league. Still is" awwwww Will
I miss the I dare you videos !
I just really wanna have deep conversations with Paco.
i bet in the future tseries will be an offensive word
You should do this live
41:39 i thought he would do the intro to parkourse
Hamilton is amazing!!!
I can't wait for Arden's side of the story. haha she seems to be fighting her side on the comments hahaha 😆
Plz could you go back to the old vids and focus less on the podcasts
Paco's gotta differentiate selfish human nature and evil. If you're a genuinely good person you'll do good thing for your own sake because that's what you like to do. It's selfish, but it's not evil.

Most of people's general opinions and whatnot come from the information and ideas they're exposed to throughout their lives, so to think that someone shouldn't be forgiven after getting exposed to new things that teach them how their ideas were flawed is just ignorant and insincere. I think it's evil to want others to be treated differently & worse from yourself, and surely nobody wants to be judged by their worst choices in life.


EDIT: Also, I think those kinds of 'evidence' for victims of underage interactions should be judged based on the content as well as context. Most of the time when the person involved is actually evil those screenshots act as evidence of  which is when they psychology manipulate the child into becoming very dependent on the person and the regular interactions with them, often the criminal makes them feel guilty for not talking to them or makes them feel like they're the only thing the criminal has good in his life, lowering their inhibitions and preparing them for sexual abuse. It's a psychopathic power play. I imagine that when the older person honestly doesn't know, then the conversations will seem more casual, maybe regular flirting.
(See: Dreamkazper from the Overwatch League Season 1...)

Nice one as usual guys, I wonder if this format would work in a live video format.
Get Fitz on the podcast
6:06 
I made that a gif 😂
Air pod human
Dear Ryan can you beat the do not flinch challenge!?
i didnt skip till the end
timestamps anybody?
Dear Ryan can u moonwalk with some one literally on yer back
On the issue of talking to underage people OF COURSE the predator doesn’t think about getting told on. Otherwise they would not do it. I would hope anyways. They have an issue so they already not thinking properly.
ryan take your meds
oh, didn't know Arden is older than Ryan. nothing wrong with that, just saying i didn't know. in fact, my older sister is dating (and probably going to marry) a guy 4 years younger than her.
Dear Ryan, could you do hockey trick shots
Ryan, do you still read the letters that you get? Like do you check your PO Box often?
Ryan do wht u love to do we will always watch u be happy 😄😃😁
1:02:40 Ryan tells how he and Arden met
27:55 lol but trump tho?
Bruh why u change ur videos
Ryan Tries basketball against a youtuber pleasee! make it happen!
I already watched it but I wanted to give it a view again
Most cringe moment 52:51

Who else goes for spurs!

better than ricegum
Can u stop the pill podcast please i like ur other videos
I hope you guys do some more spyfall
It's at 1:02:31 

Thank me later
Is it just me or does Will look a lot like Adam from worth it?
Dear Ryan, may you guys play another game with RHPC? It's been so long.
Please collab with Vsauce
Did Ryan's accent change?
31:42 | Ryan does not like his shi-shi break song.
Hmmm only a sponsor when there’s the orignal 3 who started the podcast and not the guest...nah jk they’re just new... 😔 this was a bad comment
“Sean is gone for life”
Wait... How do they not know about the nutcracker???? I've never celebrated it in my life, but I know of it. Are they trolling him?? Cuz I feel like they are trolling him.
Parkourse with KSI.
The tattoo artist  was thinking with his HEAD.
Do a reryan
hey will, you should look into programms that offer to train you and your dog to be part of voluntary rescue teams. we have that here in germany and my cousin has a stafford terrier mix that she as a hobby (!) trained in finding  people that got maybe hurt and lost in for example the woods. maybe there is something similar in america and I think your german sheperd (is i?t) should be a breed that qualifies for such work as they are also used as police dogs. my cousin and her group are all regular people that are just really dedicated and enthusiastic about training with their dog, so no ex-soldiers or police people! :)
tbh i relate to looking way younger than i am, especially without makeup. this year i'm turning 24 and i got ID'd buying alcohol (no tea there because of the look under 25 rule), but the woman who ID'd me said i barely look 18...
27:47 ahem...Donald Trump...
Nah m8.. the room looks small even on camera :)
XD awesome guys...
Dear Ryan, how to sing like your favorite artist part 3
Japan has the lowest age of consent which is 13.
Dear Ryan can you make samosas with only one hand?
Why did he delete the previous upload??
Either put KSI on the podcast or do another I DARE YOU with him
You guys should do a rapid pun segment. Someone says a word or phrase and everyone else on the podcast has to come up with puns.
Hey guys I used to be a huge fan of Ryan growing up ... he was basically my childhood ... and i just recently rediscovered his channel after forgetting about him for a while ... does anyone know what happen to Marley? I love that dog but where is he?
The nutcracker is def a ballet
Lol Ryan is so cool 😩 I just started youtube this week. I’ve been posting everyday and it’s a really cool experience
Why is everyone in his videos asian and comes from hawaii? Are they all related or something?
Make a Taki Taki pun challenge
Will respects GuyCode Rules.
What part in the video did Ryan talk about Shane Dawson?
Obama did drugs, now he is a relly nice guy
The age of consent in Hawaii is 16 years old, so neither of you would necessarily have to be at least 18 for it be legal. And it's true, the age of consent in Nevada is 16. In fact, in most States, the age of consent actually is 16 years old. But sometimes I think too many people falsely believe it's 18 all across the country. 16 is the age of consent in most countries.
How to be ninja is still up
Cant wait to here ardens version to dis
Just a suggestion! But it would be nice if you also had the podcast on a podcast app or hosted somewhere so people can download the audio version of it. That way people can listen on the go (commuting, doing errands, etc.)

Also, a live podcast event would be fun!
Your Chanel is dying haha
What?! Will did Wing Chun?!
Dear Ryan , can do a parody skit of Infinity war ?
Off off off off



Off the will.....
U guys should do a live video who agrees
People take jokes so real. What ? So you are going to take a part of a video from years ago to get attention !? Wtf grow up🙄 things change and back then those jokes were ok!
Dear Ryan can you do a bay blade battle
27:40 Donald Trump is someone who has done some pretty bad stuff in the past and is literally president right now.
Watching this at 3:35 am.
I also have adhd
The pranks idea sounds like the channel...Ownage Pranks
ryan da best
Hey Ryan! When is the collab with Pewdiepie?
I was a subscriber of his for 10+ years, and I admit that my love of his content made me not see that bad he was doing. Now that I see all the bad, I can't unsee it -- so I had to unsubscribe from his channel. Shane Dawson is/was irresponsible . He puts out questionable content and typically has to apology for it. Every "documentary" he released has been tainted by sensationalism, biases or just bad information. He has a massive social media presence, and I am not sure if: he is pushing boundaries for views but knows that his fans will support him, so he keeps doing bad stuff; or he is just completely oblivious. 🤷🏾‍♂️
You guys should do an “I dare you with KSI and the sidemen”
Do parkourse
29 comments, no views wow
Nutcracker is a ballet 😩
I checked out the merch store, where are the BOBBLEHEAD
I get that height thing, I thought Zac Efron was tall until I realised I'm maybe 2 inches taller than him
purple elephant :)
I really want another episode of Where's Will Though! Those were super fun lol. Or any games that you all would play together
The cameras adds 15 ft to the court
How to be ninja

This is how many love ryan
Please do a podcast with a fan :) Shane did that and it was so funny... (I wanna be that fan)
rayan can you do parody of cpitan marvel
I can't stand Joe. I don't like anything he does. I find him to not be funny and I really just dont like anything he does
Before I watch this I have to take a pill lol
28:00 .....Donald Trump?
I think, if you get into mma dont learn it through something like ufc. Learn from the individual martial arts, ranking and learning from the start to really call yourself a mixed martial artist.
RYAN CHANGED HIS PENDANT
Dear Ryan, Can you slap all members of RHPC in the face
Sometimes what is in the past should be left in the past!
If u a dear ryan fan like plz
I love this too much
21:32 ryan trying to not offend people
How to be ninja is still watchable
I wonder why he didn't use the code "niga"
Wow, it's harder to tell through the skits, but it's easy to tell in the podcasts that Paco is really fricking smart.
this is the only podcast i watch till the end!!! other podcast nahh to boring too much crap here you can just chill and smile!
1:30 Skip Ad
make it happen...ryan vs jake
i thought ryan said thanks taziki
I used to like you but now it's becoming harder to keep supporting you
I'm too early to think of something funny
Why do they have headphones on?
I MISS THE DEAR RYAN EPISODES
Please bring up PewDiePie vs T-Series in the next podcast
Have KSI and Arden in future podcasts
No shay, bit i thought u are didnt like getting involved with youtube dramas, guess u lacking suggestions.
This ep was eh
Yea the room does look big on camera since you guys aren't in the same shot.
Comment here to drop new ideas that ryan could do.
I’m gonna get those BTS tickets from seatgeek
So ryan and will's tips!!!! Get an older girl.
DEAR RYAN, CAN YOU DO A STAND UP COMEDY?
Ryan didnt you use to wrestle?
Haha! I unsubscribed! Lol! Are you rich bro?
"..That person will never become a president" Trump is though, after all the tapes of him saying raunchy things about women years ago))
I used to be homophobic, trans phobic, basically LGBTq phobic,  but now I'm better than that, and I'm trying to change a friends mind about those kinds of things...
Prank jenna or julian ,I feel like both of them would be down to prank the other
57:32 BEST JOKE
What’s the part where they talk about Shane? Thank you in advance!! 😀
They can’t use NIGA
where in china is derek
Post Paco's video
I want Logan Paul, Alinity, T-Series CEO, and Pewdiepie in this podcast
29:18
this is so interesting!
I am a huge musicals fan and I think it was a pretty good video I think hat they should have given u CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM like: I think that it could have been better if u included theatre musicals.
so when is paco coming out
I need that mug
40:04
Can I get a like
No  pisines of the week?
Ryan write a play and make the team act in it
Dear Ryan, can you do a gold trickshot?
Thx seatgeek
How did you meet paco?
Plz, I'm so grateful to the people that post a timestamp post. Please help us out and post those.
How do people gets so much like in a comment??
31:06 I do not agree with Paco on this, MJ was always saying he did not do anything, his Estate keeps saying he did not do anything what else could he be saying if he was alive, so his side of the story has always been around even after his death, so it is totally irrelevant that he is not here anymore. Also the documentary is not about MJ, it is about two men who had difficulties and mental health issues in their adult life seemingly unreasonably only to later realise that they were sexually abused as children and by chance the alleged perpetrator was a pop star who was always suspected but never convicted and forever in denial.
I hope u are  kiddin about cancelling the show
I’m 13 and I way more then rice gum
I can’t believe Ryan didn’t know the nutcracker
please please PLEASE i beg you stop doing this podcast i dont get it and plzzz do dear ryan or ryan tries ghost hunting part 2 again plz
can u do DEAR RYAN PLEASE PLEASE PLZ PLZ PLS PLS
For Will: there are dog sports like bitework and french ring that are amazing for hobbyists who can’t really go all the way into police work! If you see this comment maybe check that out?
Best merch advertisement ever.
Crocs hahahahaha
Your a lot ASIAN then you look!
Good one,  enjoyed it :)
I love cooking but not really sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much honestly I go back and whatcha them I miss Sean I love these cooking but not really videos
1:05:17 sounds like pack says ni**as
Youtube celebrity death match needs to happen.
nice :)
Dear Ryan, can you make a tee-hee dubstep song?
25:04 I think a message like that was in the Bible
16:40 when they take about Shane Dawson
6:16 'is that racist' no, it's not racist XD
Dear Ryan will you make more dear ryans???
yes to prank calls!
Off Off Off Off, the pill!
I forgave Pewdiepie for saying the N-Word but he keeps giving me reason to think he's racist
Which shawn are you guys talking about
yessss ryan
I love you guys more for understanding Shane and not just shaming him for his ridiculous past crap.
Give a shoutout to pewdiepie we are losing
Team Paco is cute
is ryan wearing a new watch ?
thats funny when u said the bit about obama smoking weed cause the prime minister of canada said he smoked it(before he was PM i think) and most people didnt care but some did but it wasnt enough lol
Look. I get that you have fun doing this, but your videos aren’t entertaining anymore.
Dear ryan is bga coming back
Whats Paco’s twitch handle?
Dear Ryan,do you think you are handsome or hot?
wait isnt will's surname shayhan ? im confused
They should go surprise Sean
You should have jenna on the podcast
Dear Ryan can you make how to be emo 2.0
I started watching full podcasts from the Derrick video, and then am going back & watch some more. They are nice. I listen to them while doing repetitive work in office. About parkourse, you people were very fit in it. It's not easy peasy at all. It requires all muscle. This time too I guess warm up in gym etc would do better in taking that up again. Tell Paco to train hard in gym. And it's not about winning, but having fun.............. The one who has most fun wins.............
Thanos deleted it the first time
Dear Ryan can you make a compilation of every time the big bouncing inflatable green ball appeared in your videos?
* 37:28 IT'S A BALLET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
10:47 why did I laugh so hard at this
42:04
when is shane part lol
I loved the i dare you’s
Logan Paul isn't the only person to do stupid stuff. He was just stupid enough to record it.
This whole trio of men are wonderful !!!!!!!!!
Where is the shi shi break song from JR Aquino?
RYAN HAS NEVER SEEN THE NUTCRACKER
Dear ryan: please do a my hero academia trailer
20:00
I like paco.
Plz plz do prank calls
wow they r way way wayyy smart and  mature dayum
I mean this is a great series, but there's too many of these podcasts. Don't get me wrong, these are great, but I want to see what else you have.
missing old videos
as a fan of musicals, I am not offended lol. Disney musicals are still musicals! I thought the video was hilarious. But i will admit there's intense fan bases for some of them. THANK YOU PACO FOR MENTIONING MY FAV MUSICAL (wicked).
Not first
Have KSI on the podcast
i’m totally up for accepting people who acknowledged their past or mistakes but the pewdiepie case is different. yes, he did acknowledge it and apologise, but, a lot people just don’t believe him because of the way it happened. he said the n word at rage and just accidentally blurted it out. that doesn’t happen to people who don’t say it which means he prob did it behind camera.
ryan don't you wanna pursue more acting careers? like tell me how i die your scenes were really good
Dear Ryan how much does your house cost
Paco made a remark at the end of the Podcast he was single and wouldn't mind a female or a male. I'm a male and I like you Paco. I live in Primm, NV. I am 59 years of age. Divorced. Father of 5. I have steady employment. I'm not pretty but I'm not too ugly either. Love all you guys at NigaHiga. Y'all are the BEST!!! Thank you for the love and laughter over the years. You guys really helped me through my divorce. I'd love to give back to y'all some day. Thank you again and I Love your Podcasts😂🤣😍
I miss Sean
nigahiga host meme review?
There’s a meme of Shane Dawson and his cat
I’m exited to use Seekeekk
Clappy clap
How do you wear a beret, headphones and have a thick hood up and not be sweating like a pig?!
Oh it's that guy what i was watching in 2009 to 2011....then i started watching pewds...but coll he's alive...
2 likes would be great
Paco❤️ Ryan 💎
Where are the ads???? Put more ads!
Why are they talking about a white supremacist being president hypothetically as if there isnt actually one in office right now in reality

I wonder when there gonna make another BgA song.I mean it's been two years.Where is it at Ryan?
Shouldn’t just freedom of speech be enough to protect people from old tweets?💫 At least from the state?
why is this so funny and i never get bored watching and i dont like podcasts
i really like will
forgot to put reddit in the description
do actual vids u f@g
Dear Ryan, do an eating competition with the others
1:05:14 ?
Dear Paco, where's Ryan?
The legal age of consent in Denmark is 15, and usually it’s pretty easy to tell if someone’s under 15, so it’s not really that big of a problem compared to how hard it is to tell if someone’s over or under 18
Dear Ryan can you do a house tour?
Does anyone else notice the color difference on videos when you hover over it and when you take the mouse off it? weird.
How does ryan not know what wicked is
Ryan tries to have a girlfrie... Oh he already have...
1:05:04 that vid ws every romantic movie.....
Our society is quite unforgiving. If someone is able to change, we should encourage that behavior and let them become a role model. Instead, it's as if the internet makes changing seem not worthwhile because you'll be attacked anyway. Society needs to move away from the concept that people don't grow and can't be changed by their experiences in 5, 10, or however many years it's been since they said something they're being judged for.
but why should the people who changed be praised when it is the right thing anyways and if people frown upon them it doesnt mean they are morons, like you shouldnt lessen people like that but idk
Spurs?Dose he mean tottenham hotspurs
seatgeek is great ty
lol.
I think Ryan watches Auronplay!
Dear ryan do a house tour
do the trailer
wtf no one thought it was weird that paco was interested in someone he thought was a 19 yr old at 28
What a cute mug
1:07:02 no, do it to random people. Maybe celebrities that you guys can get a hold of.
1:06:11 PACOOAHAHHAA
Dear Ryan, make another skitzo
Can guys talk on how to confront depression on the next podcasts?
Great ideas on sexual misconduct with under age children. There is so many things that take account it sucks that things like this happen so often !
Dear Ryan can you do a parody of marvel please
What the hek is the steak story
Am i the only one who loves the podcast without the special guests?
Dear Ryan, do another dear Ryan video
You guys are so honest about sponsorship stuff. You are literally reading from a page. Other's go to such extremes of  appreciating the product, and you can obviously tell they are being fake. Not you though, even though it might cost your next sponsorship(not trying to scare you or anything)
People are stupid idiots because they want to see people's success crumble.  No one can have a clean slate we're all bad, but yet they want to pull down someone who's had a change of heart.
Podcast are so boring
What’s Paco’s twitch?
Man I love paco
I think it’s just as scary that you’d have no problem chatting up a 19 year old just because it’s not a criminal act anymore. She’s still a decade younger than you and at that age that still matters. A person approaching their 20s could never be on the same maturity level as someone who is on the door or their 30s.
I miss the old comedy video
Shane was JOKING! Why is this a controversy?
Anyone miss sean?
.... but Trump is president
U guys should do another I dare you.......  idea you to drink a shot of hot sauce then brush our teeth
Hey I was just watching the you guys were the first in 2011. Let's make history repeats it self guys

Bring KevJumba
2005 insecure gets bully by cheaters in school . It's cool to gossip about cheating with teachers sexually and on test as well as curse and make profanity joke about lgbt. Now being a prude pc lgbt is the right way . Then it all collapse with metoo victim going too far and saturated where a witch hunt became everyone is messup, so we forgive, work place abuse is normal. No more credibility,
Dear Ryan : can you make a horror movie about a toaster?
Am I the only one who thinks dating a woman that's older than one is is weird? (Speaking through a straight individual, because in my culture, usually the man is a couple of years older than the woman, I don't know, lemme know your thoughts, whoever is reading this comment)

Dear Ryan have you ever been kicked out of your house?
Ur awesome
😃
KSI is ‘bulking’ that is why he’s big
so are they ever going to do skits any more or am I unsubscribing?
Am I the only one who’s kinda uncomfortable that a 28-year-old guy was trying to get with a girl he thought was 19? Like it’s legal but I’m 19 and people who are college age lack a lot of experience that people in their late 20’s has and that creates something of a power imbalance that tends to make relationships like that pretty unhealthy
Let’s be honest what white guy hasn’t said the n word
dear Ryan can you dress up like SpongeBob in public
Dear Ryan can you push a car
48:34 THATS WHAT SHE SAID
That president conversation you guys were having is Donald Trump. He is a known racist & sexist, but people still felt like he could be the change so he got elected
Why did this get deleted and then reposted?
Shane talk at 17:00 you're welcome.
Yeah people don’t believe me when I say I’m 17
people that ACTUALLY believe that shane came on his cat are idiots. how gullible are you to actually believe that story? like... jesus christ
We have to make you guys first again and bear PewDiePie and T-Series.
Pls do dear Ryans now, these pill podcasts are boring.
Where's the Shane part?
Isn’t it sooo weird that Ryan is such a good, funny guy, yet he is friends with so many duchetubers like Logan Paul, Jake Paul, and KSI?
This is how many people don’t like Ryan 
                    👎
PewDiePie needs your help
I have noticed that Nigahigastill at 21M for awhile. I hope they're gaining subs... Where the OG NIGAHIGA FANS AT??
can you talk about stereotypes in clothes and makeup?
Please Get Pewds on the Show
Logan is 2 inches taller than jake
I actually thought that YouTube was deleting videos from creators with the name Shane Dawson in the title because this also happened in one of PewDiePie's videos. Is it just a coincidence?
stop doing Of The Pill videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
nigahiga name is racist!
Dear ryan do a baseball trickshots
How tall is Pewdiepie irl ?
I know it’s legal but a 19 year old and a 28 year old is still a bit of an oof
Kick Paco off
Why was the old one deleted
PEWDIEPIE guest on podcast
Wow this is boring unsubed
Not a mental illness. It's an attraction just like anything else. The sooner people realize that, the better. If you are going to do something sketchy, be smart about it.

Ryan had a pretty nice argument but my view on that is--- that the person running for president and a youtuber only have in common is to uphold their reputation. The candidate for president has a country to run while a youtuber only has a channel to run. (I hope that makes sense. EnglishAin'tmyfirstlanguage)

SEATGEEK SPONSOR
What happened to the first
Early gang
Hello
Woo
WE LOVE OFF THE PILL! EARLY SQUAD
Not that people should "get away" with stuff .... but I'm always confused why people don't clean up their social media etc. Usually when stuff comes out, so much time has passed. They had plenty of time to get rid of it. Granted once stuff is out there... it stays out there. But apparently there was a window because these things sat out there for years without anyone noticing🤔. I love Shane but he knew how he "use to be"... BOY, go clean up your ish! Haha. I'm not saying entertainers should hid stuff etc.. its just odd that after they have grown that they don't make sure stuff they dont stand behind is erased. I wouldn't want anything out there that I wasn't proud of!  Great podcast! Much Love 😉✌💚
I wish the old skits were back
niggahiga
Ryan's channel is dying...😭
re-upload it seems still gonna watch
29:02 damn..I'm the opposite. I'd pick the one with less flaws. I know that everyone's not perfect, but some people just do less bad things than other people you know.
For the people who are asking why he did a re-upload...
You've obviously haven't checked the max resolution of the last one.
get victor kim on the next podcast! or kevjumba!
Don't STOP with the podcast! Please! 

I look forward to these!

21M subscribers 
1.3M views
Ryan creates original content
People don't give a damn






Ryan is highly underrated
If Shane Dawson was here he’d be screaming and freaking out the whole time 😭
PLOT TWIST: The Woman Is Actually Ruby.
This is Ryan's best attempt of making a serious video
Ryan is so original. One of the best youtuber. How come he only has 21M subs.
That woman literally laughed so much at literally nothing
the lady laughing the entire video was scary than all the voices they were picking up
suddenly i want to see ryan and ryan&shane from buzzfeed unsolved to do a collab...
just imagine how lit it's gonna be if they do
also - really enjoying the "channel makeover" and the new shows and new vibe - its keeping just the right amount of old silliness while branching out into new stuff - well done everyone!
This video was really good I want to Ryan to do more ghosts hunting videos
Ryan:*go pick it up*

you! It’s your show!
Did anyone else saw at 0:42 with English subtitles he wrote " This is Ryan tries (better than LWAIY, meme review or pew news) " 😂😂
He needs to do a collaboration with buzzfeed unsolved
This completely changed my view about ghost being fake
It's a business, bet the third guy is controlling the equipment. It is their equipment...
Omg my mom watches ghost adventures all the time for some reason. It's weird. Once the main dude (Zack) fell over a chair and blamed it on a ghost 😂
You wanna know something more scary than ghosts?
Ryan could really make a serious video without letting us know it was serious...
DUDE THE WOMAN IS FRICKEN POSSESSED
Reading those after credits is making me laugh out loud 🤣  
19:13
I don't wanna be rude, but that woman guiding them is scarier XD 
But she's so nice thooooooo
This one video got more activity than all the seasons of BuzzFeed unsolved combined lol
Laughing Woman: My husband just died
Ryan: Oh I’m sorry.
Laughing Woman: Starts laughing hysterically
Buzzfeed Unsolved who???


Who’s Ryan Bergara?? I only know Ryan Higa
dear Ryan can you wear glasses in each video you make?
That lady’s laugh scared me out through out the video lol 😂
This is my third time watching this, YOU NEED TO DO THIS TYPE OF VIDEO AGAIN 😂❤️
HE SERIOUSLY MANAGED TO ADD JOKES IN THIS TOO
Turn on the subtitle and skip to 20:21 ..You will seee somethong creepy.
ok but ryan be lookin damn fine and also reminds me of david tennant as the doctor
This was awesome.  I hope you guys do more of these  type of videos again!
IDK but I can see clearly the ghost from this video than anyother video like in bathroom, bar
Ryan: Gets dragged into the shadows by ghosts 

Lady: *dies of laughter
Zach Bagans who?
I only know Ryan Higa😂
Hands down the creepiest thing in this video is that woman's laugh 😂😂
Jills laugh is creeping me out and I want to leave but I can’t because it’s a Ryan high video
WE WANT MORE OF THIS!!! Also, pls do a collab with Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara. They have completely opposite beliefs but youre like the center. The "yesn't" type of person—THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
“Only to find out it’s a noise Greg makes” 😂
When are you doing another paranormal video . The first one was dope
everytime ryans device functions
lady laughs
The lady's laughter was the most spooky
That Woman's laugh freaks me out
RHPC : so are we gonna make a funny or scary video? 

Ryan : YES...
I actually really liked Rudy probably one of the first friendly ghosts anyone's ever seen HAHAHAHAHA
He was there but not really
reminded me of 
Cooking but not really
For a sec I was like RYAN AND SHANE? oops
That lady sounds more like a ghost when she laughs
They are serious and joking at the same time. I love it
Im trying to be serious bjt the girl make me laugh
Video starting
Me:hhmm boring 
Someone talks at the ghost detector
Me: holy mother!
My brain: why da hell is the lady laughing, what da hell?
Dear Ryan,
Can you do the Naruto Mirror run challenge?
That lady shes like "Somebody Died here thats his body GAHAHAHAHAGGABA"

Edit:AND LOOK AT THE FREAKING WAY SHE OPENS HER MOUTH AT 8:30
Can someone explain,*why is Peter Griffin voice is in this video?*
Peter Griffin's voice is in 3:31
The guy on the Middle
Imagine if the ghost killed Ryan and when you go to where he died you will hear a TEEHEE
Dude Ghosts are Totally Real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was incredible evidence my man!
Just when i thought ryan couldnt get any hotter... 

Ryan: wears glasses 
Me: explode
wanna hear a scary story
sure
alright its gonna be so scary... LOSING WIFI
AAHHHHHAHHHHH
Idk if Ryan is being real or something confusing my walnut sized brain
woah its really real hahahaha 
if you read the description 
ryan said that its (100% real)
That poor ghost was trying to poo but you keep on disturbing him
ryan higa the first man to go in a woman's bathroom
Ryan, please make more ghost hunting videos.
I love the autoplay.. Buffeed unsolved
Omg pause on 2:09







It’s a joke chillax
Ryan's face when the woman started laughing hysterically all of a sudden...😂😂😁
3:32 I have that NCR flag as well! Fallout New Vegas!
Why wasn't Ryan in youtube rewind?
Because he was to good for it
"I think men are just smelly "lol
Because of the intro the whole time I kept waiting for a "Tee hee" XD
Bruh...

"Only to find out its the noise our cameraman Greg does when he's scared" 

Tickled me 😂😂😂😂😂
Goodsprings.... Nevada..... hmmmmmm 
*big iron starts playing in the background
That Yes And Me Freak Me Out Mann It Give Me Chills🤦‍♂️
I love how nigahiga is talking like bear grills cause he thinks that is what a interviewer talks like hahahah
when the woman showed her the photo I was like... that is not "validation," my own freaking sister looks like that! And my sister is not a ghost.
Its amazing how much work Ryan puts in this video and doesn't decide to put ads on the video
"look"..."Area"...."Much"? Three random words...Oh paleaseeeeeeeeeeeee.
You should actually be on an episode of ghost adventures 😂🙌🏼💯 Zak is awesome!
Why hasn’t anybody sent this to Zak Bagans!!???😂😂
Every time I watch these ghost hunting video

They say: ThEse gHoSte aRe FriEnDly!

They obviously wanted to kill you
Everone: freaked out
Jill: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
You should have called this series “Tryan things”
The K2 flashes red when surrounded by a dozen electronic devices..Wow! Who'da thought!
was this a serious video?
i legit can't tell if this is staire or not ???? LMAOOO
All of the debunks were from Greg
Then we discovered that it's actually a familiar noise that our cameraman Greg makes when he's scared.....😅😄😆
Turn on the subtitles/captions. Makes the video even better😂
I don't know which was scarier...

THE GHOST 

or

GREG
THIS IS WHY I LOVE RYAN
11:37 that lady is more scarier 
She is freaking me out
"Dude, ghosts are real"
"No they're not"
"Yes they are"
"WHAT? 😐!"

😂😂😂😂
why do all ghost stories/hunts happen at night/with the lights off? like I get it, for the chills, but I don't think spirits have down time during the day, just saying
8:37 “validaAÄÆåÁaaÃæHtion”
I love this omg make more of these videos 😂😂😂
8:30 when you accidentally open the front facing camera
Ryan: "Hey go pick it up"
Paco: "You! This is YOUR show!"

😂
Is this actually like for real? Or is Ryan just making a non-serious video?
Please make this into a series!!!!!! I give you one dollah!
Please do more on Ghost Hunting. This was great.
Ryan please try mma fighting for one of your videos since you mentioned how you wanted to do that in your podcast.
Im 100% sure that everyone wants to see that
Me:Is this real
Ryan: Yesn't
Ghost: kills someone 
Lady: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAGAGAGAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It was real but he did a funny voice over
I love that people buy into the whole faulty electronics thing lol. GREAT video though!
Ryan should collab with Ryan of the Ghoul Boys.
Ryan and Ryan! 😂👏💕
I don't know what's scarier
The ghosts?
Thought of Ghost Adventures immediately in the intro XD
Ghost Adventures my favourite show

Right when I'm about to be scared something funny happens😂😂😂
11:38 if you turn on subtitles it says that creepy laugh is scarier than the spirits
14:19 creepy laugh never stops she scares away the spirits I’m telling you
That women laugh scared me the most in this whole video 😭😭
the only real explanation me: did you here that  lady: thats ruby me: that's freaky. meanwhile in the background greg's mustache is making this noise 7:35
lol the DEBUGGED thing was funny
Do more ghost stuff
The scariest part is the woman laughing to be honest
I honestly thought this series would be more parodying, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised
Ghost Hunters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nigahiga Tries To make One of The most trending HORROR Short movies.........






THIS IS NEXT GENERATION...
8:36 That sound omg lol
When you make the mistake of watching this at night so you have to watch old Ryan videos so you can sleep😅
The old woman laughing made it scarier a little♥️.
Look.... area... much..

The ghost probably was taking a ** and he/she got uncomfortable cause they were looking at him/her too much
the credit parts killed me, srsly will tf u doing man 😂😂
i LOVE the fact that he made it exactly like the show Ghost Adventures
That woman's wheeze really reminded me of Ryan
20 minute video with no ads? 





ryan is the best youtuber👊🏻😔
The guy who did the subtitles;
-Swore.
-Dissed LWIAY, Pew News and Meme Review.
-Self advertised using the subtitles.
anyone else see the light coming from that window darken a little bit at 17:00?
TURN ON CAPTIONS! You won't regret it lmao
Not scary, 
But funny 😂
Ryan Tries next episode: Testing Child-birth simulator.
u should really investigate about dat women ...laugh
😂😂 this is so funny, now I can watch horror movie in peace 😂
wowowow never thought I'd ever see Ryan as Zak Bagens😂
19 something? 😂😂😂
The scariest thing in this video was the woman's laugh.
Greg, could be Aaron and Ryan Zack and will as billy
Me starting to feel scared

*laughs when the lady starts laughing
Lights: turns on
Me: forgets that they’re motion censored GHOSTS
Wait what part is the woman laughing

I
At some points i keep forgetting thats not zak
“Muchly freaked out” 





Me: Interesting?????
Seems a lot like Ghost Adventures lmao
(Btw I hope Ryan makes more of these)
yes Greg I think people do read the credits :)
“Oh my god I just got chills.... the ac vent is right there” HAHAHAHA
Make this a whole series
Whoever made the subtitles needs a nobel prize


Thanks for no dumb jumpscares at the end, Ryan
PLEASE. DO. MORE. GHOST. HUNTING.
Thanks Ryan I really enjoyed that video keep it up I really enjoy your videos
Hey there demons, it’s me. Ya boi.
THIS WAS HILARIOUS!! "All we know for sure is nothing" 😩😂
I still love ghost adventures
Ryan as Zak & Paco as Aaron 😂

Ryan : hey go pick it up 
Paco : you, this is your show!
Watching with closed captioning is AMAZING 😂😂😂
really enjoying the "channel makeover" and the new shows and new vibe - its keeping just the right amount of old silliness while branching out into new stuff - well done everyone!
ryan:
lady: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
You really look like ZAK BAGANS
I feel that you can talk to Ruby anytime. She feels friendly.
I have NEVER seen a video for 20 minutes and feel like it’s this quick
You really made an effort making this video
Paco at 15:04 🤣
Ryan: Hey, go pick it up
Paco: You! This is your show!!

😂😂😂😂💀💀
Is it just me or do the inaudible spirit noises sound like Gaster from Undertale?
are you sure it was not the energy from women laugh that was picking up ? on that receiver ..
Greg once said
-"Moaaaaann"
0:23 anyone else expect him to play a clip of the Greg dare during I Dare You Cabin Edition?
bruh he put the ghosts in the credits lol
You should make more ghost hunting videos it's less scarier and fun to watch 😂😂😂
Whenever the old lady laughs.
She makes me feel more terrified then the video itself.
I just saw you Made the video  in 16 Mar 2019
You should rename the series Just Tryan
Wonder if Ryan was going for an Ali G vibe but more subtle
Omg please read the credits it's hilarious
I started to get scared when Ryan said the men's bathroom stank 😂
Paco to Ryan: You pick it up! This is your show!! 😂😂
I loved this video xD Thank you Nigahiga (;;
I DONT KNOW WHY BUT THE LADY'S LAUGH JUST CRACKS ME UP
Enjoy your work and videos!  Good stuff!
Howdy Pardner!? Welcome to Goodsprings!
“Omg I just got chills the ac vent is right there it’s crazy how cold it is”😂
Why dont you do it at 3 am? It wouldve been more scarier if you do that😱
Yooooo wtf those 20 minutes went by hella fast
14:01, aaron from ghost adventures there laughing
End credits were amazing
0:23
"Dude ghosts are real"
-"No they're not"
"Yes, they are"
-"What?"

I had to pause the video to laugh
I'm lowkey concerned, but if ghosts are real that means the Holy Ghost is real therefore God is real, and I have no issue with that :)
It's funny 'cause I was watching paranormal activity videos the same morning. I don't normally watch them, but they started popping up on the recommend side and I decided to. I had no idea that this video was out until a few days ago, so that's a pretty cool coincidence. 
Also, I love how Ryan was actually pretty serious and respectful during the interviews etc., and then you hear all the funny commentary and see cool footage. This definitely does reaffirm, for me, all the stuff about paranormal activity. Thanks for trying Ryan :D! You did something I doubt I could do 😆!
You should really go back and see if the activity is the same... just an idea
Ghosts don’t exist...
Is this a parody? Is this a paranormal investigation? Is it a paranormal investigation of the parody? Only Ryan knows.
Edit1: wow. Never got this many likes. Thanks.
I felt like i watching new season of ghost adventures 😂😂😂
Maybe the lady who always laughing is been tickled by Ruby
Would love an entire Ryan Tries series with paranormal investigations.
Bro ghosts are real
No they're not
Yes they are
That lady’s laugh is the scariest part of this video 😂
Now I wan more of this 😂
The "Debunked" and "Debugged" parts had me laughing so much 😂 Please make this into a series!!
00:43 - Subtitles

Very debatable, but it’s definitely a worthy challenger
You're in Goodsprings and there's an NCR flag on the wall? Nice.
wow that was actually better than most ghost hunting shows LOL
QUALITY CONTENT ...always
LMAO GHOST ADVENTURES PARODY I LOVE GHOST ADVENTURES AND THIS IS HILARIOUS
NCR flag in the background, interesting.
More of the show!
Halfway through and I have no idea if he is being serious or satirical..because that's just how he is
This lowkey freaked me out a bit 😂
Ryan was just finding an excuse to go in the girl’s toilet.
15:03 

When Zak makes Aaron do everything he’s too afraid to do himself 😂
I've been subscribed to Ryan since I've had YouTube I havent watch a video in a long time but I was not disappointed
Read the description it will explain stuff
"Is there anything you want to say Paul ?" 10:55 "Hell no" xD
I didn't even realise I had the subtitles on but the subtitles made everything so much funnier
Can you please do more of these 😂🖤😂
I can’t tell if this is legit or a parody
Ryan, please do something like this again. I think you did a great job, maybe even made fun of Ghost Adventures, but your video was authentic.
Everyone: screams and is freaked out
Lady:lmao
19:10 
Yes, I’m even pausing to read these credits
Oh man... Your voice overs had me in stitches and the woman's laughter was so wholesome and reminded me of someone I know irl xD
I thoroughly enjoyed this one! Please make more!!!
I love this. Can we get another episode of  Ryan ghosts hunting?
Bet you had a hard time sleeping? 😏😏
You should try McKamey Manor
This was amazing. Please make more ghost hunting videos
im dying because of the voiceovers lmao
The woman's laugh is more terrifying than any of those spirit's sound.
This is the gordon ramsey of ghost hunting
Ya'll really need to make more videos of these! It's so authentic i frikin love it!!
Love Ryan with glasses

No homo
At 20:20 you could see Ryan was actually freaked out. 🤣
I need more of this. The way they cover all the ghost activity in the most trollest manner is just hella hilarious. 100% better than ghost adventurers.
The end credits are amazing.
Wow Ryan ur my child hood BET younger u never expected to do this I would be to scared and ask if the ghost knows BTS😂😂😂
Was this Relating to Ghost adventures cause I loved that show
Ryan Tries: Avoiding Copyright!
ghosthunter in a nutshell:
goes into 1000 years old germany castle
speaks english to communicate
"Oh the spirits are all friendly here"
Are... are you talking about them like theyre animals??
Please do more videos like this. It was chilling, yet very entertaining.
Now Ryan has a ghost fan love Ruby =DD
ghost does something lady laughs like it’s the funniest shit she’s heard
Lol, did anyone read the credits?? XD
Nothing scared me except that woman's annoying laugh
Maybe some of the ghosts just need to take a whizz. Leave em alone! 😂😂😂
Please do more of these. It was incredible
That one girl literally dies: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH THAT HAPPENS
At 10:07 to 10:08 i noticed the girl spirit said just one
I love this so much! Another Ryan Tryan ghost hunting!
ryan can you make more of these vids
Ryan:
That Lady: CHAAHHHHHHAAHAHAHAHHHHHSSHHHSHSH
ghost : does something or says something
Lady : HAHABLAGHAGHA
Dang nice ghost adventures ripoff
Absolute gold!
that subtitle tho
is this a joke?
Is it just me or did yall get happy because it brought back new vegas vibes 😂
The “Ghosts aren’t real” “Yes, they are” was such a perspective changing moment! Good job Ryan!
Did anyone pause each time the credits roll?....


I've found eating in the bathtub
Paco needed advice on whether or not to call with 4 Kings???
No one:
Literally no one:
Pedophiles:
Ryan higa: alright so were going into a womens bathroom
can you do more of this please ?
Ryan: peaks over stall  

Ghost: Didn't you ever learn to knock 


Edit: Thanks everybody for 500+ Likes
Yes ryan, we so read the post credits. LOL!!
what's more scary is her laugh... dam i got chills
Ryan are u an indian?😁
PLEASE we need more of this!
LMAO you're missing out if you didn't read the credits
10:08 i thought i heard 57 or 7? Or maybe Steven?
debugged lol
Tbh I can’t tell if this real or not😂 or mixed
That girls laugh was the creepiest thing about the video😂😂😂
ITA SO FUNNY BECAUSE OF THE GHOST ADVENTURES
those devices are fake
theyre so nerveus ryan may try the device there so they just said thattheres activity there
Loved this! Specially since Unsolved is between seasons.
The new episode of ghost adventures is crazy scary
The intro killed it.. This is semi-hunted and çomedy
Can you make this into a regular series??
"We noticed that the flight pattern of the orbs are that of a bug" lmao
i cant watching ryan so serious.. always expecting something sketchy.. xD
The laugh is way too scary my God.
It's like a jumpscare but even worse.
Ryan Higa, a mere man turbed ghost buster...
It seems real to me amazing video I read the nouns in the last of video thank your mam for the snacks 😂
haha just the intro sold me XD
Ghost finder “The Bluetooth device is ready to pair”
- dude ghost are real.
-No they're not.
- Yes, they are.
-WHATT???
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I burned my dinner looking at this stuff! My sausages were CREMATED! Thats not because I was enjoying this...it's because I just don't believe it.
Bruh I'm dead. The women's laugh is the most haunting thing if this video I swear😂
She laughs about everything. 
Ryan: so this is where she was murdered?
Lady: HAHAHAHA wheeze HAHAHAHAHA
we need a part 2
I liked this ghost hunting/comedy, it makes it less scarier
His content keeps on getting better like wow, he is a man of true talents.
I can never tell what is a joke and what is serious...
Ryan, why are you so unpredictable?
Ngl Ruby is such a cute ghost
This actually looks real but I can’t tell if Ryan is ever serious😂
I’ve come to the conclusion that this is real, but Ryan’s narration makes it seem fake
In The next episode of Ryan Tries Ryan plays i dare you with ghosts....
Go for RYAN TRIEN, Because it sounds COOL !!!
Loool, dunno if I'm gonna believe if it's real or not.
MORE OF THIS RYAN! ASIAN PRIDE
dude ..ryan should this again..like if u agree
Credits were so funny😂😂😂snack service provided by Ryan's Mom🤣🤣🤣
Did anyone look at the credits 😂😂
I am figuring out if this whole video is real or it was just, you know. Ryan Higa is not just the best youtuber, he also is the best actor 😍. Yeah?
Turn on subtitles at 20:19
I can’t tell....if this is a joke or a cool documentary.....is this a skit or real.....Ryan wtf man
The punchlines man HAHAHAHAHAAHAH
If you could do more of these ghost hunting stuff that would be cool.
The real scary part of this vid was that womans laugh ,gives me chill everytime
Plz make more of these lmfao 😂😂😂
12:43 "It smells so bad in here" 
Well maybe the spirit's taking a shit and he just wants some privacy.
A rip-off of ghost adventures
He's acting like Zak from ghost adventures
if you guys on the subtitle, 1:41  'RYAN IS GOD'    lmao
spirits will never do when you asked them to. they do it secretly and left us with wonders
"Dude, ghosts are real"
"No they're not"
"Yes they are"
"WHAT"
😂😂😂
Bs video, too long, uninterresting overdone editing and crew, unprofessional
Yes, we actually read the credits
Do more of this! This is really good
Do more please lime if you guys agree
I wish the most subscriber war was between Ryan and pewdiepie
I thought Ryan's going to say "I've never believed in ghost until I came face to face with one."
Also please do this again! This was hilarious and fun to watch.
The ghost adventures opening shot for shot has me in tears
Dang Ryan I hope you or someone on your team reads this because it's actually awesome like turn on CC for this video I thought you made those and your editing/uploading messed it up with double caption they literally call her laugh everytime "creepy lady laughs"
that lady needs to get her lungs looked at by a doctor
Watched whole thing, still can't figure out if this is fake or not :P
This is great stuff!! Can't wait to see more Ryan Tries!
Also featured in Fallout new Vegas
Idl if this real or not but @18:35 there looks like a body in the middle of the curtains
No joke, I would enjoy seeing a full ghost-hunting series from Ryan!
Wtf this lady laughing is more scarier
Seen someone else with a similar post but Ryan this vid was funny and the kinda shit I love not saying ya should make a whole series of ghost adventures but ya know maybe another video or a follow up
I think it would be worth testing out which materials react to these pieces of equipment when placed next to them..
okay but the lady's laugh is so creepy wth
You should name these series Tryan not Ryan Tries
This guy and his channel have lost the edge. It used to be great 8 years ago.
Here in the Philippines we have Ed Caluag
You remake the Ghost Adventure and the thumbnail also you copied from them
i love how the beginning is a parody of ghost adventures lmao
Ghosts are real 
No they’re not
Yes they are
Really?
😂😂
Idk if this was scripted or not?
Watching this with subtitles is hilarious 😂
WHY AM I WATCHING THIS? IM SCARED OF GHOSTS but srsly tho nice vid Ryan                      I'm listening with headphones which makes me freak out more
WE NEED MOREEE
We later figured out it was a familiar noise Greg makes when he’s scared 😂
Just realized I’ve probs watch nigahiga for 10 years now
Top 5 scary videos came into the bottom  recommended  section lol
Lol i paused every second of the credits part just to read it 😂
“Ghosts are real”
“No they’re not”
“Yes they are”
“WHAT”






Ryan and Shane in a nutshell ( buzzfeed unsolved)
It is really frustrating to see this effort gets low views 🤦🏻‍♂️ he really spends a lot of time and effort on his vids .

edit :  When I posted this I wasn’t pointing to this specific video , but all the great videos that Rayan makes . 
Also I didn’t expect to get all this attention 😅
I had no idea goodsprings existed i just thought it was in fallout new vegas
Dear Ryan, make boxing trickshots. 😂😂😂
lmao okay wait watch this with captions because I thought youtube's captions were Ryan's and that sh*t is HILARIOUS ACTUALLY like please someone watch this with CC on or whatever that is called cause that makes it GOLDEN
This seems legit, but then again... this is Ryan
Dear Ryan,
Make a horror movie trailer about demonetization and copyright claims
at 13:51 was the cameraman purposely overreacting like Aaron Goodwin?
I literally read the title as "Tryan Ries" instead of "Ryan Tries"
There are things in this world we will never truly understand,UNDERSTAND
Ghost has crush on Ryan.. She don't want them to leave because she is in love... 😂
I lost it at DEBUGGED 😂😂 if ghost adventures used more puns like this I'd watch it more often!!
AMAZIIIIIIIIING
WANT MORE PLEASE
13:15 that spirit is tall AF😂😂
Remake your very first vedio.
Please do more ghost hunting parodies! It’s hilarious seeing you subtly make fun of them :)
10%-actual ghost stuff related to this video
5%-other random stuff



85%- about the lady's laughter
lady laughing
ryan: looks around
How does Ryan still not have any merch?? 




I can’t be the only one wondering
OH NO NOW I CANT SLEEP
I'm surprised he didn't do an impersonation of the BuzzFeed unsolved guy
8:18 thats the same lady that was showing the picture THIS IS SO FAKE btw not hating.
20:25
Ryan: Woah dude look
So I read the description and that’s spooky
Do yourself a favor and watch this whole video with the captions turned on. It makes it so much better. xD
something creepy happens
Woman: HAHAHAHA IT'S CUTE
the lady scared the hell out of me!!!
Is this real?🤭😂
Ouh this was great! I do hope to see more videos like this from you!! ☺☺☺
"Debugged" - Seriously just killed me.
Sorry I just can't take this seriously. XD

Like every time Ryan talk, I am expecting a pun...
this was legit scary and also yes ryan we read the credits, for you cause you're cool and all
This vid creeped me out more than the actual show(ghost hunters or something) 🙈
Damn wonder why ryan wasn’t in the vid, good choice to have Zak replace him for this one though.
the ghoul boy sure need the REM pod
i can't take it seriously the whole video I'm just waiting for the punchline
"Ruby loves it when her story's told."

What?

Ruby: Yeah! Did you tell them about the part where I was raped before being killed? 

I'm sorry, but if I was brutally murdered I certainly wouldn't want my death to become a tourist attraction for people's amusement constantly reminding me of it.
Ryan never wore white 11:24 Paul's ghost got him 😱
So good !! So much effort was put into the parody but i was scared and laughing all at the same time !! Pls do more of this !!
Please do more ghost hunting
It's funny how Ryan know that this place is creepy but he makes it sounds like comedy

Edit:OMG THANKS SO MUCH LIKES LOL
Can't you make this into a series? The whole ghost hunting thing. It's so interesting
the lady is a lil quirky
You NEED to do more of these!
Ryan Investigates: Is this real?
Next Episode of Unsolved : Hey guys here we are at the Pioneer Saloon
Is this really real? Like idk i mean i do believe ghost but is it true or not?
Hahahah for a second I thought I was watching ghost adventures until he said “back in 19.. something a long time ago” then I remembered 😂
asian zak begans
dark underwear in the credits lmfao
The editing and voiceover was so damn good. Loved it 😂.
In the intro you sound like the guys from buzzfeed unsolved😂
The scariest part is the lady's laugh
You should do more of these videos
omg, i'm dying laughing, he made it like a real show :))
"Make more videos like this" like if you agree
Wait,  ia this real or not ?
„All we know is nothing“ Ryan the Sokrates of today
Bro this is soo good😂💯✌
5:34 why is there a NCR flag
The lady's laugh is the most haunted thing through out the entire video
Credits killin me😅😅😅
Ghost adventures copyright?
nani???
Ok first of all the lady's laugh is giving me creeps
Actually want more ghost hunting with Ryan.
DO MORE OF THIS!
The credits are god like
The sound they picked up that was only Greg 😂😂😂😂😂
I can't tell if this is ryan screwing with us, or he's actually scared
Ryan could actually make a living from making documentaries
Can't hear the ghosts over THE LADY's laughter. What is so funny??!
WE. NEED. MORE. OF. THIS
what happened to GTFO ryan 😂
Your hot spot (area with activities) are the same as GA`s
The woman was a ghost. I swear her laugh for scarier than a pissed off ghost.
Y’all are killing me with these comments 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭LMAO
That woman has a serial killer laugh
bruh turn on  cc (bottom right corner of the video), go to  11:36, and see what it says!
The fact that The guys are still making jokes kinda makes me feel not as scared....I was thinking about how to survive In a horror movie.
Plot Twist

The laughing lady was possessed by a ghost who was making her laugh at not funny things...
In this video,the lady scared me the most with her grimmy laugh..😞
I need to know....is this real ? And if it is... WHY ISN'T IT ON TV ?!?! even if it isn't, it should be
Ahaha snacjs services prkvided by ryans mom, I need to check that place to see how good it is 😄😂 and ghost 1??? Ghost 2 3 4??? Lololol you should have wrote ruby
I'm admittedly adoring Ryan's ability to make a ghost hunting video both intentionally funny and unexpectedly scary at the same time.
Debugged"  man i love you Ryan lol
Who you gonna call?
Ghost hunters!
As a fan of Ghost Adventure, i really love Ryan's parody. So much fun. I'd like to see Ryan Trying series, i like the funny version of ghost hunting, maybe we can "debugged" muchly much more haunted places.
A collaboration with Shane of Buzzfeed Unsolved might be great.
Also, Ryan, i do read credits. I'm a big fan of Ghost 3!!!
So, will we have Dark Underwear as merch?
Are they actually doing this or is this just a skit?😐
lol I think she was just accidentally on selfie mode
Ryan tries using golf sticks to hit Shawn under a blanket
I expected someone to dig through a spitoon with that music and vibe.
DO MORE OF THIS PLEASEEEEEEE
Quest Started, Out of the Saddle.
Legend says if you're early:
Bruh it wasn’t even 1 minute and I was already laughing, only Ryan can make me laugh that fast.
This is Ghost Adven..*ehem* Ghost Hunting .
more ghost hunting!!
8:36 "that's validahhhhhgggggtion right there" 💀💀
Honestly, I'd love to see this turned into a full series, I would watch it 24/7
I am so f@*’ing scared like. If you agree
Inaabangan ko lumabas si ed caluag
In the caption it said Ryan tries ( better than LWIAY , MEME REVIEW , PEW NEWS ) NOT TRUE I HATE NIGAHIGA NOW I WAS FAN OF HIM AND PEWDIEPIE NOW I HATE NIGAHIGA I LOVE PEWDIEPIE , BROS FOREVER
I literally couldnt see anything in the second photo
We can all agree that Greg is the scariest ghost of them all
I didn’t know if the legit or nah
I've always legit wanted to go ghost hunting but never had the money or the time to do so. Now I have the time just not the money, lol!
Is this legit?  I can't tell whether this is real or fake because we all know how ryan act right!?  😂
As someone who used to watch these kinds of shows all the time, this was highly entertaining!
9:25 turn on your captions! 😂
Ryan higa should collaborare with Ryan Bragara,But higa is probably gonna team up with Shane and make fun of bragara.😂
6:13
right over he..
over th..
h..
there by that booth
Welp now I can say ive been in a women's bathroom
You should name it ‘tryan’
"Cameraman Gregg makes scary screeching noise"
Yo dude make a part 2...the only paranormal show i can watch...
Please make this video into a series. I love these videos!
18:35 that curtain shadow or thingy scared me
Love how Ryan made this funny and kinda creepy at the same time😂

Edit: thank you for all the likes
half the time I can’t tell if he’s being legit or acting
You could make your own ghosthunters, I really enjoyed how chilled I got and humored.  My gosh, that is a fun chemistry you have.
You could make your own ghosthunters, I really enjoyed how chilled I got and humored.  My gosh, that is a fun chemistry you have.
I was watching this with my sister at 3 am and then the first thing happened (right before the moaning) and when he told us what the moaning was my sister laughed so loud my dad woke up and took my phone to his room :) thankyou Greg for being a mood.
I am absolutely terrified of ghosts but imma gonna watch Ryan's video anyways because it's Ryan
I MET ZAK BAGANS A WEEK AGO. I'M MAKING A VIDEO ABOUT IT. I LOVE GHOST ADVENTURES
The most confusing 20 minutes of my life
DO THIS AGAIN THIS WAS AWESOME
8:30 looks more like the lady with the phone
Nobody:

The women: REEEEEHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHA
Did anyone notice the New California Republic flag?
3:42 that dude's voices and that lady's voice should be exchanged
Ryan try sky diving
i wanna know is this really all staged or did ryan actually went on real ghost hunting?
You should make Ryan Tries into an actual series.👍🏻




Good ex: 
Ryan tries spiciest hot wings 🥵
Ryan tries Dark souls 🤬
Ryan tries to drift race 😵🚘

Hey Ryan why don't u call the show "TRYAN" like Try-an. ( :
So... Ryan's team has showed more footage in 18 mins than a few hours of some ghost hunting shows.
WHY AM I WATCHIN THIS AT NIGHT
Everyone is scared...

Woman: hahahahahahhaahahahahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahaha
IDC if ghost is real or not. I  just don't want to be in contact with them.
that lady laugh is more terrifying
1:09:35 Idk if you guys made it to the end of the video but Paco/Ryan said if they reach near a 69k likes within the first week of this video releasing, Arden and Ryan will do a reaction video to agents of secret stuff on HigaTV

Ryan doesn't even need special guests for the podcasts to be interesting
I feel like the podcast gets better every episode
Paco is amazing at this podcast ting! Keep it up all of you, im legit enjoying this!!!
I would love to know about Daina and Greg's relationship story and origins. And Monica and Will's. Even Arden and Ryan's.
I love how greg is wearing the ''painting'' that he and will made
To be honest I don't even care if no new guests come to the podcast.

I'll be fine if only the RHPC members and other people that appear in NigaHiga's video participate it's enough.
Dear Ryan can you host meme review ?
we want dominic, chester see, kevjumba, derrick
Will and greg are like "nah Ryan, that video ain't coming out before this podcast" lol
EVERYONE LIKE THE VIDEO SO RYAN AND ARDEN WILL REACT TO AGENTS OF SECRET STUFF
Paco: we have to keep it under 60 minutes 
Me, looks at the time: well it looks that didn’t happen
I really wanna see Ryan and Arden react to Agents of Secret Stuff!
But guys on a serious note... Can the volume of the video please but turned up a few bars... Like it's difficult to hear sometimes
hey paco, you don't need to keep the podcast under 60- I really enjoy the show
Ayyyy 
 
My mans Greg finally getting the recognition he deserves
their origin story really makes me appreciate EVEN MORE how much effort they put into the videos
Also love Will and Greg's relationship. Will is such a hypeman for Greg. Talking about his value. So sweet
My new favorite podcast 🙏🏼
Ryan and Arden reacting to ass would be soooo funny I'm here for that
Will was right, the ghost hunting video isn’t out yet

Edit: it’s out now!
Ryan’s dad still has a flip phone! SO DOES MY GRANDPA!! 😂😂😂😂👍🏽
I'm actually a fan of this podcast. I hope you keep making them!
And once again, the mentioned video is not out. I actually like how the podcast is a sneak peek of the video
Hi Ryan and the team, i dont really comment on youtube but i just wanna let you know how much i looooove your podcasts. They are my favorite thing on youtube right now and i find them so entertaining and clever and i just love the interaction you have between each other. Lots of love from Taiwan and i really hope you keep on making them!
Is it just me or the volume's low on this video ?
Lol 😂 Paco is like the mom toward the end trying to get them to end the video
Can y'all do an episode about the rhpc couples, like you don't even have to go in depth just normal stuff like when did y'all meet, when's the anniversary date, your mom's birthday, the last four digits of your social .... you know surface level stuff
If you aren't watching the whole podcast (which I don't know why you wouldn't be) go to here 1:09:05 to see why this video needs 69,000 likes !
How i met your mother how greg met ryan
The volume on these podcasts is soooo low, except for the shi shi break music which is loud af
Sean and Ryan’s Not So Excellent Adventure reaction has to happen now.
Damn this is nothing related to the podcast but, you all have super nice and clear skin. Like I was just looking at Paco’s forehead it’s so clear. Super jealous. Also you guys are super humble and amazing, I love you guys, keep up the amazing work.
This was my favourite podcast so far 😆 I could definitely listen to RHPC talk for ages
Nobody:
Greg: dana’s pretty hairy
When is the next: will&greg show, wild card and dear Ryan. Podcast is amazing but just wanting the old series as well, just asking
I love the podcasts with Paco because he does an amazing job facilitating the whole thing. He's an amazing interviewer!
Ryan's dad is like one of the 99% of the population of parents with children born in the 80's/90's
EVERYONE LIKE THIS PODCAST. .WE WANT ARDEN AND RYAN!!!!
If Ryan's dad had a hard time understanding technology, I find it hard to believe that a 100 year old ghost could figure out how to use an electronic ouija board
okay these guys are cool but...




can we get r dizzle hannate and regina on this show? maybe even steve?
Dear Ryan,
Make a horror movie trailer about demonetization and copyright claims
Heyy sorry Greg's audio is too soft :(
When is arden chay gonna come to off the pills






Edit : if you guys didn't go till the end of the video then just like the video because if this video gets 69k likes than Arden and Ryan will react to agent of secret stuff.....plz like this video
Haha I love Ryan's reaction when they brought up "Ryan and Sean's not so Excellent Adventure"
Oof, I would've liked it if I only had seen this earlier
I always felt Greg's filming and editing talent and skills were so underappreciated
There’s no way this is getting 69k likes in a week 😂
please react to agents of secret stuff with Arden!
Get this to 69K ASAP
40°.... I'm from CA, moved to SD due to job, I'm freezing with -10°  😂😭
1:03:37 this would've been a perfect ad for skillshare. Too bad they didnt want to sponsor
YO RHPC they made the peg pants an actual thing LMAO. Search up "wearable chair". stealing y'all's inventions smh.
I am sad that this episode ended... I enjoyed it so much. I feel like the podcast keeps getting better & better each episode
“when i saw him (Derrick)  i was kinda intimidated by him, now i... hate him” I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING Greg always comments at the right times
I feel the audio is a bit low on the podcasts, my pc is on full volume and its still not loud enough
Jenkem... does that remind anyone else of KevJumba?
has Ryan been taking his pills these past few podcasts? he can finally stay on track 😂
Okay, so I actually have a question that's been bugging my mind for a while. Ryan has many people working together with him. Sometimes they are in the video, sometimes they are not. Probably they're just helping with something off-screen.

So, how do you guys actually share the income from this kind of work?
Probably it's a bit weird for asking this kind of question but I am sooo curious about this.
Will with his hood up lookin like lil ging the rapper
No we like hearing about the podcast and intro
Shamwoohoo is my favorite video
Reupload with 3 minutes cut ;D
It’s probably out...
6 days later: still not out



WA WA WA
In 2012 this used to be the most popular YouTube channel
Omfg Greg’s shirt!<3
Guys let's get the video to 69k likes so Ryan and Arden can react to Agents of Secret Stuff!!!
WOW Paco not letting our questions be answered
Hey Ryan bring Regina and Hanate to the podcast..
WE WANT ARDEN ON OFF THE PILL, DON'T WE PEOPLE?
I DARE YOU: to make a podcast which has a better first half than second half
So will&greg had humor and dance
Dom had  Dance and youtube
And Ryan had  Youtube and humor
Why do i see a pattern here?
Greg's shirt tho XD
Yahhhhh, it’s reupload time.
Loved hearing Greg talk. I love the podcast exactly because I get to hear what's on your mind, something I've always wondered about while watching your videos. Please continue killing it!
Bruh I went to the past video with the ghost stories just watched the whole bloody thing lmao just to know what they where taking about talking.
Decides to wait for ghost hunting video to come out before continuing watching the video. 
1 week later
Now I can fully appreciate the references :)
Dear Ryan,
Make a horror movie trailer about demonetization and copyright claims
Who remembers the painting on greg's shirt? 😂
i think subrediit could be used  differently , normally it used to connect to the audience .
*could be asked to send video question as fans  like to be featured in the video
*could be used for any fun challenges 
they are way  more creative than me , i need not give them any suggestion
Don't make the video less than an hour. It's already short enough
how do I get the shirt that greg is wearing????? I NeEED
Love listening to you guys! I listened to this one throughout the day 🤗 Keep it up. Shout out from North Texas :)
^^(PLEAZE MAKE DRAGON BALL Z TRAILER)^^THANK YOU!
I love these podcasts I listen to them before I go to bed.
David Dobrik would be such a great guest!
I feel like nigahiga is slowly losing his audience and I hate to see this because i've been watching him for quite a while now and every single video cracks me up every time and I don't want to see on of the best YouTubers on this platform go. Ryan if you're reading this I have really appreciated the time and effort you put into all of your videos and your true fans will always be with you.
7:08
Ryan: it'll probably be out!
Me looking for it: It's not out! 😥
do a skit on ur origin story for 
ur next vid pls
This is the most I've ever seen Greg talk and he's actually so well spoken
Ghost experiences are so entertaining to watch on this podcast. The first podcast is my favorite because it was kinda creepy. Astroprojection, ghosts , sleep paralisys and stuff
Petition to bring ARDEN CHAYYY.
CR7 IS BETTER THAN LM10 
WHO AGREES?
Why isn't your podcast longer?
Ah c'mon Ryan, I think I've watched agents of secret stuff at least 10 times, if not more. I would understand why you would cringe but it's SO GOOD. Anytime I'm bored or I have time to kill for about half an hour I put on agents of secret stuff. It's hilarious and there are very sweet moments and tbh been shipping you two ever since that video so I'm very excited for you guys  😜  The best part is for sure: RUINING THE MOMENT! I use that line in real life whenever I see my bff and her boyfriend flirt 😂
i always wanted to know the back story of how they all met each other although i know that they are all connected somehow but which one came in first you know. and it amazes me to hear how they explain things because you hear how deep of a thinker they all are. their passion for what they do is amazing and that is why i am so proud to be one of the lamps still out here watching Ryan's videos because you know that he's not just here for the money, he's here to be creative. which was the main purpose of youtube for youtubers before. and that's all folks.
This podcast is a MAJOR throwback <3
I love these podcasts❤ keep going RHPC!
can you just let these podcasts go for hours please and thank you <3
Dear ryan can u walk on moon?







And please no puns that you just tear off a paper and wrote moon on it and walked over it.👍
Who remembers the first time uploading XD
Can u do another BOYSGENERALLYASIAN BGA
I'm pretty sure Paco is a big Ryden Shipper. AHAHAH I CAN DEFINITELY TELL
I’ve been loving the Podcast keep it up
no pc-ness of the week? :(
DEAR RYAN BRING BACK SKITZO LETS GO
“sounds like an i dare you” WHY CAN I IMAGINE THEM DOING ITTTT
Thank you Will for at least reading some Twitter questions. Damn paco if Ryan and Will want to read Twitter questions then let them read them
Please like the video!!! Agents of Secret Stuff is so good and we need Ryan to react to it!!!
Invite WongFu or Dtrix maybe? 😄
You know those channels that make the "_____ podcast but its actually good" edits? Thats what the beginning of this episode reminded me of. Thank you guys for the laugh
you guys are making podcast only recently with only some skits
KEVJUMBA MADE A VID BACK IN THE DAY ABOUT JENKUM LOL throwbacks man
i’m glad you finally answered the question everyone wanted an answer to.... can ghosts be racist. thank you
Greg is Steve Wozniak, Ryan is Steve jobs.
Why was this reuploaded?
I would pay for Ryan and sean to watch their own movie I never got to buy it cuz I was little then and didn’t know how to order it but hell I would pay for that
Bro, this is what I'm talking about. This episode was super dope, guys. I jus love listening to you guys talk and reminisce about everything. Keep up the good work!!!
Lol 500th comment YoU'rE WeLcOmE
Dear Ryan,
Can you bring back A.S.S 
Part 2 with Arden
Petition for Ryan to do an off the pill podcast featuring blue shirt kid
Hats off to Greg's editing skills. You, man, are one of the greatest
Greg thanks for all you do. You’re incredible!
You know.. you don't have to end at 1 hour.. is there a specific reason they stop exactly at 1 hour? I mean I would  watch even if it was 3 hrs . Just saying
Dear ryan can u please make another BgA song👍👍
Dear Ryan, 
Continue dear Ryan and reveal the water flip from the real Real life  trick shots
It is so weird hearing so much of Greg's voice
They can talk about their next video in the podcast to generate hype!!
The first thing Greg says..AMAZING START..
I'VE HAD ELECTRONIC MALFUNCTIONS WITH SUPERNATURAL EXPERIENCES AS WELL!!!

When a medium came over to our house to read our hand signs, ALL the stereos in our living room turned on by themselves to EXTREMELY loud static for a good second before popping off! The chilling part of the story is that the stereo's weren't even plugged in since we don't even use them anymore! (I'm getting chills just talking about this story!!!)
These podcasts are helping me go thru work  without sleeping hahahaha
I love your videos!!! RHPC is the best ❤️ Ps: Bring Arden on the show!!
35:19 is "How Greg met Ryan?"


Thank me later...
Also can we get a collab with CoryxKenshin please??????
I LOVE THESE PODCASTS I WAIT EVERY SUBDAY FOR THIS
I want the whole cast  to be on the podcast
And talk about the the funniest things that happened during their friendship
The video will be posted........ just not before this podcast. Jk take your time!
I want the no 1,youtuber to become no  1 again.
Hey Ryan and friends, this podcast is great and I think you guys are doing a great job. Keep ‘em coming. Good day.
Even though paco can be.... well, paco, I feel like he really helps keep the conversation going to the point where I notice whenever he’s gone, this was a great podcast
Can't wait to see the ghost podcast and as always great pod cast!😁❤👍
I remember him from when Ryan was a judge of a YouTube version of the voice 😂❤️
"Daina's pretty hairy" ~ Greg, 2019
Ryan if you need a writer lemme know. We've got very similar humor (I've been a subscriber since the start so you've rubbed off on me) and I've got some ideas you'll like.
I'm a creative writing major in Utah and this is what I want to do.
Edit: I'm also a musician. I've been playing guitar for a long time now and currently looking to get into recording
LOVE these podcasts so much, they're so entertaining!
AND PLEASE ALSO MAKE ^^MOB PHSYCO 100^^ TRAILER
Hey Ryan 👋, i just wanted to say that your podcasts dont get many views is probably because people like me listen to them on Spotify
Hey Ryan, you should add a download link to an audio only version of the Podcast in the description, that way you can keep track of your views outside of YouTube as well! Have a nice day :)
Dear Ryan
Can you make a video of how to score full A's in exams?
* Warning: Unrelated *
* Please ignore this if you aren't Nigahiga*
So Ryan, You probably won't see this, but this is my last attempt. I was a subscriber to this channel for a couple of years now, and I've seen that for a couple of months or so, you were able to have a taste of #1 on youtube. You also know (hopefully) how bad demonetization is, and as well as the problem with false copyright striking.  As of right now, I think that everyone can agree on how corporate Youtube has become, and honestly, there's probably no stopping it. Corporations are taking over instead of creators, and this causes creators to have a lot of competition that they can not compete in. As of right now, the only person that is able to stand up to these channels is *Pewdiepie*. He probably doesn't have the best look, nor does he produce content that many people like, but he is still trying by uploading every single day. You might already be aware of this are you probably are trying to stay away from this topic in order to avoid potential controversy, but please, help him. He needs to hit 100 million first before T-series, because only that way, can youtube acknowledge a Creator before some faceless company. I believe that only you can make the final difference in this battle. 



Dear, Ryan
Keep em coming, core podcast fan member here😂🔥
When you're an old CreepyPasta fan and sees Momo as a female version of Jeff...
Hope ya’ll didn’t miss the end of the podcast but 69k likes = Ryan and Arden gonna react to Agents of Secret Stuff!!
That explains Dom's videos early on.  I'm glad Greg and will switched to rhcp since Dom's videos were kinda cringe worthy later on.
Ryan it's not Zambodia,IT'S CAMBODIA. XD
Probably my favourite podcast 👌
Waiting for your old type of videos
Well... google Ikiryō and you'll know that whole "Sean's ghost" concept from Paco is possible tho haha
Yooooo
U made it to 21 million
Just as much as ninja
25:00 I would love to watch you guys go to the Queen Mary Ship, and do the research
Did Greg do the Stale Bread outro?
There's no +/- light on YouTube. It's simply a +/- on humanity at this point.
LOVED hearing about all the creating process and how the guys work together! It's not something u get to hear anywhere else.
Idk about you guys but I am totally on board for 1hr+ OTP Podcast
these Podcasts from Ryan are inspirational bro
Is it weird of all RHPC member how ONLY Ryan & Sean don't know how to dance (oh yeah and Josh), but like everybody else was in a dance crew. Talk about those artist skills
wongfu project off the pill podcast?
Smash that like button guys if you want to see Ryan uncomfortable with his GF
I am from India and this is like a night dosage for me, thanks Ryan for the entertainment. 
And keep the podcasts going. Love them💜
Great podcast guys, could you turn up the audio a bit thank you <3
I don't usually miss a nigahiga video, but I think I will skip the Ghost Hunting one, because I'm too scared.
Love the podcast! Nice to see a bunch of friends just being real.
Can't wait for Daina!
Love her!!
Why'd you delete it the first time? Watched it completely, then the comments weren't loading. Then I reloaded, and the video was gone. 

I will NOT stand for this. I will NOT have you deleting videos, and NOT addressing it afterwards. I will NOT... So, I'm sat on a chair instead. But I will NOT stand for this.
Love you guys!! I been watching since 2008
Top 387 comments YES A RECORD
cAn'T bE eXpLaiNeD? = Gh0uSt, hmmmm... seems about right
Greg's shirt! I need it- by far one of my favourite videos of you guys'.
You should make a trailer about RHPC plz
I love this SO much and I love you guys so much! I always wanted to know the background of how this amazing friendship emerged!

Love your podcast guys!! I always listen to it when I am doing assignments. I like the shi shi break and I get the urge when I hear the words. Interesting. Keep up the good work guys !
RHPC needs to make a full movie 👏🏻
Dear Ryan, on your next Off The Pill podcast, can you guys or just you dress on as pills and do the podcast, that would be hilarious 🤣
Is nobody going to comment on the fact that within the first 20 seconds of the video Greg literally said "testicles in my mouth" clear as day
I like watching these on the side when im playing league or in the backgroumd when im working on something. Keep it up guys
Guys make sure you like the video cuz if it gets 69k likes he'll react to Agents of Secret Stuff with Arden
Don't forget to like the video for Ryan and Arden reacting to "Agents of Secret Stuff". Get it to 69k 😉
I was the one who answered how did Greg meet Ryan! Yeet! ❤️ ✌️ 👍
the intro audio is louder than all of your voices combined
when you talked about the ring girl i had to look behind me multiple times because i was affraid i would just feel something breathing behind me
Dear Ryan, can you please make a conspiracy theory video about Billie Eilish?
pls get some pop filters
These podcasts are the best part of my Monday mornings, please keep posting them! :D

Who is here after the reupload
Isn't that momo face inspired by a japanese legend?
Due to the Law of the Pendulum the Skeptical becomes Believer and the Believer Becomes Skeptical.
Like, everyone is atheist until you are in a meeting with people... and when you are in the toilet you realize that there is no toilet paper. Thats how people become believers. lol
Can we just talk about how much I actually kinda miss Internet Icon? it was so entertaining.
Kevjumba in a future podcast?
I gotta take a shi-shi break too. These podcast are so awesome just so long. It takes me a day or two to finish them. I don't start them unless I know i can sit and watch it.
Ive just found out u were the most subscribed YouTube channel at 1 point in like 2009 and first to hit 2 mil 3 mil and 4 mil mad!!!
69,000 likes for a reaction video from Ryan and Arden on "agents of secret stuff"
Paco can't show his legs coz he ain't got legs...

PACO IS FELIX confirmed👌👌👌
Yesssssss! Been waiting for my boy Greg to get on
Bring wongfu to the podcast!
Im really loving these podcasts!
Ryan, Honestly I think you are making too much of these podcasts, when are gonna get those old funny skits again??
Ryan should do a podcast with his gf, I’m just super saying
What did Will say at 1:05:42?? It sounds like gibberish to me
Bring back B.E.S.T. Crew! Anyone else remember?
Dear Ryan ,can u do nice guys Trio podcast?

Better & Better all the time! Good to see Greg on the podcast & didn't Paco come from Wassabi Productions???
How tf do you make a podcast
Video is not out again 😂😂
But love the way you tell us about the next vodeo 😍
Give the people what we want!! We want Derick in the next one!!
if this ghost hunting video is just a long video with no evidence of ghosts........ it'd be lowkey boring. you should upload it if u got the content!!!
19:15 I only know what Janko is because KevJumba made a video about it lmao
Guyz like this video to 70k...
Why don't RHPC make a StepBoys 👟👟🐾🐾
Movies instead...
I still remember paco's ducky video
dear ryan can you walk on one foot without hopping?
Would be cool if you did a podcast live here on youtube
he's loosing viewers because of the podcasts
How to be Emo 2.0
it'd be cool if you guys brought fighters on sometime, maybe up and coming fighters or something since ryan is a fan of combat sports.
Wait, the intro is "Off-off-off-off"? As in, off the pill? I thought they were going "AFAFAFAF"
Like that Zimbabwe stuff...🤔
Dear Ryan - Can you make a video 
on how People from different Ethnicity do daily activities
I really like Agents of Secret stuff... I watched it about 6 or 7 times possibly more... I got my cousin to watch it and she really liked it... I got my cousin to watch these videos like the one about cardboard against paper (I think it was the Google cardboard video). I also got her to watch smosh because she really liked the content... I want to always rewatch Agents of Secret Stuff... It's always popping back up in the videos right next to the ones I watch... I once told my friends about it and one of my friends'  wanted to watch it...
Maybe Congratulations Sean 🙏?
welcome back ryan ! how are you this fine evening "
Dear Ryan, what's RHPCs MBTI?
Step Crew - 2020
Wait, the Momo challenge was a hoax? Someone in the Philippines overdosed because of it. 18:00
I have nothing to comment

So like for a free cookie
all these years, I only credit Ryan for these creative and great videos but it was all of them who made it. Without one of them, Ryan's channel will never be the same.
Greg so funny mann 😆
I remembered the cabin "I dare you" video. And it is still giving me chills
Plz invite any youtuber from click
Why do you have to be "out of time" I say just keep going for a bit if the flow is going.
Can we have Regina and Hanate in Off the pill podcast 8?
Blame Uncanny Valley for getting spooped from Momo's pic.
Huh, I’m starting to suspect the thing about world war 2 because in this unit in my classes we are learning about it and mostly about the holocaust. Like not like in a bad way, and there’s a whole bunch of like hitler memes. So yeah idk.
Can you pls make the volume louder
answer all the questions left in another podcast!!!
For however long the ad is, im gonna watch the whole ad video for RHPC
I really like the podcasts, but in the future, you guys should leave time stamps for your topics
Love you Greg!!!!!
Thanks for including how y’all met. That was my question (I was @papimarron :))
I’m making a sentence with all the subjects in the title:

Dangerous Challenges are making kids self-hunt themselves into ghosts. 
This makes Ryan, Will and Greg reminisce about when they were younger and how Nigahiga came to be.
Dear Ryan, why is Paco always Hugging pillows?
That origin story makes me feel old. Been here for yeara watching you guys xD
woah i feel old because of this reupload
Dear Ryan, Greg/Will should make a video on editing videos using effects. Would love to see dem talents!
That "how" at 24:48 made me spit out my water. Never imagined Greg could make that kinda sound lol
Why is this so enjoyable to watch
Dear Ryan, instead of how to be ninja 3.0 or how to be gangster 3.0, do how to be NERD 1.0 for the ninjas and gangsters
UH I LOVED PEG PANTS
Yay Greg! Also, Paco really hosts these well
Dont know if its just me. Or does it seem like paco is the host of this
Please react to A.S.S, im not trying to be dramatic but that video is arguably one of the most iconic and influential youtube videos ever posted, especially for the time it came out.
My lil African heart was crushed when Ryan asked what's a Zambian..hahaha 
But seriously know where places are guys. Come on!
I love these podcasts so much you don't even knowww
Let's get it to 69k likes guys!
Can you please make another BGA video
I love these weekly podcasts. So nice to listen to while working out
Plays intro:

"You see things visually"
Can you do a deer Ryan video
I want to have friends like the RHPC
How many likes to get Ryan to react to all the original “how tos”  

I cant be the only one who still has the dang emo song stuck in my head... right
you should make a separate channel for the podcast like logan paul did
I love you and your videos and just to have you for an hour instead of a short skit Is like having church for a day instead of 2 hours but better
5 days left to get this vid to 69k likes D: are we gonna make it?
Always a good day when RHPC uploads :)
Would not mind if we have a full ghost hunting series. Plz and thanks.
Oh dang! But your dad answered at the "i love u dad" vid. EXPOSED. How could u do that to us sadpepe
Edit: 5:47 and the video was called the "i love you dad" experiment
Maybe 30 minutes is good
Dear Ryan,
Can you do do the bottle flip challenge with van shoes??
Only the true fans will remember the first upload of this....
I just read your book that shit is amazing
I think KevJumba talked about that drug Paco was talking about years ago.
Anyone remember? Doubt the video is still here on YT tho.
PUT PACO IN THE THUMBNAIL. I almost thought he wasn't going to be there.....
What was Greg's favourite video, I didnt seem to catch what will said ( 1:05:40 )
I dare you to do a headspin on a puddle!
Guys, your audio is way too low. I have to put my earphones on max to hear what you're saying
69N guys! We need to do this!
Let’s get this vid to 69k likes so we can see Ryan and Arden react to “Agents of Secret Stuff”.
Hurry up! Like the video! We need a reaction of agents of secret stuff with Arden!

These videos are a bit quiet, I always have to turn up my volume for them.

Did you see someone stole your idea of peg pants and turned it into a real thing?

Once again.... the video isnt out
Momo was a sculpture created by an art student. It was supposedly supposed to be a bird like girl. Someone saw this video and adopted it as there own to scare children

XD WHO ELSE NOTICED GREG'S SHIRT
Petition to bring back skitzo

Sign here  ____________
Every podcast just gets more interesting lolz
kinda weird my middle school self was following them through all of this
The second half was so great! So motivational
Ghost can hurt or injure if they are strong enough
DAAAANG, paco needs more respect
the volume needs to be turned up lil bit 😩
Dear Ryan 
Can you grow a moustache
I'm more scared of people than ghost. Ghost can't touch me but people can.
Constructive Criticism Hour!!!  love you will :)
Paco representing the shipperss!
Greg = Mario
KevJumba made a video about Jenkum. The poop/peep in a jar, left to heat up in the sun and sniffed 😂
1st time Greg in Podcast
How has victor been??? Pls get him on the podcast pretty please
These podcast are the best for a good sunday evening
This was the first podcast I finished 😂
Ok we need more likes so Ryan and Arden will react to A.S.S. lol
TRIGGER WARNING somewhere around 15:45 (I'm not going to get the exact timestamp) they put up a picture of "Momo," and it's not the cat they were just talking about. For some people, myself included, that picture is super stress-inducing for whatever reason, so if you know that's something that could bother you, or you've seen it once and don't want to see it again, just know that ~15:45 is the time to close your eyes or switch to another tab.


Edit: looks like it stays on screen until about . Happy listening ✌
Paco is too powerful with that soundboard
Hi




(sorry for my bad england)
Lol i dont why the views drops this is really nice and funny 🤣🤣🤣
I miss the old RHPC
Yaaasss Paco is killing itt! His idea  to start the podcasts with recent funny stories had me laughing my ass off, this definitely grabbed my sleeves XD XD
where has Derrick been lately?
My favorite podcast!
I liked and I binge watch this series everyday.
Why reupload?
wow we love origin stories i need more
cory sent me here
this crew is just underrated
Greg's shirt 😂😂😂
Greg the genius.
You should really add clips of things u mention
I find it funny how Ryan didn't want to spoil the next video even though he already spoiled it on his Instagram lol
Can we get the will and Greg show back
Favourite podcast so far to be honest!
I'm in love with the intro Everytime
Who wants dear Ryan to come back.
I just love it when Will says " getttt emm! "😂
YALL 69,000 LIKES LETS GOOOO
The disrespect to Zambia😤
Damn, we will never see the reaction. I really wanna see Sean and Ryan's awesome adventure lol.
Ryan, I hope you can get your vids un claimed. If there is anyway the community can help tell us. I myself would love to help.
I am seeing this after Ryan tries ghost hunting😄😅
I thought momo was just a new photoshopped grudge and ignored it lol
sooooo ghost hunting turned into inspiring podcast. thank you guys
Dtrix on off the pill
Chester See on off the pill
I really don't mind these 4  on all podcasts. They are really entertaining and they know how to keep a conversation going
I remember you like 8 years ago lol
Anywon from coryxcenshin
Dear Ryan, could you do a conspiracy theory on mo bamba and president Obama
Paco is a good interviewer
Come on i spent so long trying to make the bad one work without even checking for a reupload
Why the re-uploaded?
Now that we're talking about ghost hunting, I wonder if it's possible for Ryan to invite Ryan Bergara and Shane Mandej? Just to get both perspective on ghost.. Skeptical and believer 😂
Like this podcast now so that we can see Ryan and Arden reacting to Agents of Secret Stuff!
I love this series!!
Make an OffThe Pill Podcast with Pewdiepie!!
You guys still friends right?
now im excited for the ghost hunting video
i would freaking pay to see ryan and arden react to A.S.S
JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I LOVE THESE VIDS AND THE PODCAST SO MUCH😆
i'm not done watching the whole video but let me just comment this i love this topic 'ghost hunting'...I find it very interesting good way to go ryan and his team
If u saw the 1st upload u are a veteran here
everybody like if you want ryan to make the movie agents of secret stuff 2
Guys I am late with the episodes 
Can anybody tell me what those are episodes about?!!
you posted this at mar 10. have a super mario!

Please reply do you have some psysic powers
cool t-shirt, Greg!
i just noticed they cover the Hyper X headphones logo
Please Like this video forrrr Ryan and Arden react to Agent of Secret Stuff..... We need the like...
Who else remembers Ryan and Sean’s Not-So-Excellent Adventure?
Where's the guy who gets the like from Ryan?
From an outside perspective, I don't think the ghosts, If there where any, would want 'Japanese  to remove' because most people don't know Hawiians are Japanese
Okay so should we start liking the video?
Ryan I love your podcasts they are amazing! All of you are always super entertaining and funny. Every time that I have to drive to work and back I always put you guys on my car and listen to you. Usually thats like a 20 minutes drive so it takes me a bit to finish each podcast but I enjoy them a lot! Please make more. I enjoy them a lot and you are the only podcast that i listen to
This is when you know you're older when you get excited that one of your favorite YouTubers puts out a podcast.
watching this after the ghost hunting video, that video was SO cool and amazing!! would be nice if they did more stuff like that haha
if you didnt get to the end of the vid, if it gets to 69k likes ryan and arden will react to agents of secret stuff!!
Have Derrick and or Arden on please!
Dear Ryan,
Make a Get Out parody
If you see ghost you can fight it.... Just say 'jai Hanuman' it is a Indian god who can fight demon 😂🤣😂
I can listened to it whole day😍😍
Greggggg! Finallllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Super nice to hear Greg's stories about himself and his editing and stuff. 'Have been really hoping for this. You've been an inspiration for me for a long time hehe keep up the good work. Hope you get to do the things you love for as long as you'd like.
SSSOOOooo are we ever going to see these videoss of Greg and Will
I've realised Paco looks a bit like Brendan Fraser
this guy was 1 most subbed channel ever for years ago but it nit there anymore
Sorry my mom won't let me watch YouTube for 1hr






Its sad but true
this is some deep rhpc lore
Why wasn't Paco in the thumbnail?
The video stopped when they were talking about their camera malfunctioning and battery dying and freezing thing during the ghost hunting time...
I was hella scared...
Can you do podcast with Arden?
Just wondering why they didn't start a podcast until now?!
When he said put a picture of Momo I thought he was going to put his brothers cat 😰
dont make these vids LOL
Why did this get privated
dear Ryan, can you fix the flag of Sardinia?
Loved this podcast most so far
Ryan you should make a reaction video. That would be funny
Not an episode i should have watched while eating 😂
Today's fact: More than 6,000 people with pillow-related injuries check into U.S. emergency rooms every year!
HAHAHA RYAN AND SEAN'S NOT SO EXCELLENT ADVENTURE MEMORIESSS
DO MORE I DARE YOU sorry caps
What about Erika, Monica, and...?

Higa can u do ...what if horror movies had no mistakes ... For example people don't FALLING EVERY FREAKING TIME THEY RUN¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ugh we won't get to see Ryan react to Agents of Secret Stuff
Paco runs this podcast so well
This was the 360 video
I should not watch this at night before starting to study
Please please please have wongfu on this podcast!!!
Where’s the energy drinks tho
Man, these are the only podcasts that I really watch

Dear Ryan, make a skitzo podcast that's actually an hour long
Greg is so cute even with all that beard and moustache
LISTEN! If you didn't make it to the end of the vid, Ryan agreed to bring Arden on to do a reaction vid to "Agents of Secret Stuff" on HigaTV if they get 69K likes! Like the vid before leaving, please! :D

Re-uploaded?

Thanks guys
Editing? Podcasts?
I saw ghost hunting and I clicked as fast as I could
0:20 My PC froze when Greg started performing weird Jutsu again...
This is my favorite episode so far! The four of you are the most interesting and the most funny together. :)
lol i do a Martialarts  class as well
That was the best intro!!
THANK YOU YES MORE GHOST STORIES I LOVE YALL BRUVVVVV
25:25 something screamed into my ear one morning woke the shit out of me for sure it was weird...idk how to explain it, a super interactive dream?
Wow. Two Vids in one day.
Can you guys do a tutorial on editing and how you do it bc I want to make videos but Idk the first thing about filming and I'm broke lol
this rhpc guest thing has to happen at least a month in these podcasts, i miss seeing your lot like this!
I like how this series is slowly becoming Paco's Podcast🤣🤣
Future me: They’re wrong, the ghost video is out!
Lmao Ryan stole greg
Greg is my spirit animal. No scary crap for me!
Why did they reupload?
2rd viwer like 30 second wtf
GREG! GREG! GREEEEEEEG!
no offence but...






niggahiga
what if you turned off the TV before he ring girl got out?
Hey guys you know what would be so cool? Remember when you made candy crush trailer, you brought Mario at the end...taking that somewhere would be so cool
Get Elon Musk on you podcast
Back in the day Ryans name must've been Negro Higro.
hey just curious, but what does greg use to edit? he must have several different apps to create the graphics he does but it’s phenomonal!
Momo has been out for a while now, why is everyone talking about it now?
Dear Ryan, can you do a shower with corn flakes?
Why does Paco keep stopping them from asking Greg questions man
Tbh I’m surprised Paco was familiar with Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell... idk I was forced to read it for ap Lang and I never would have seen Paco reading that type of stuff
How I met your Moustache
what if you guys are cursed now?
Can you please bring parkourse back
I made a video about you 




Your 2019 is cursed like to undo
I love how you post all your stuff on the same channel!!
Nice to listen to while taking care of my baby
Hey what happened to doing stuff with chester
This video is actually incredible, there is so much to learn from how they approach and deal with life.
Who's gonna post timestamps








Maybe you reading my comment
Volume too low. Is this what you hip kids call the asmr?
I went to watch the videos... 7 years jeez.
Are those the cloud 2's? I have cloud flights, but have tried cloud 2. Both are very comfy
Yaayyy GREG IS HERE! 🙌
Ryan should host meme review
I would love to see Arden Cho as a special guest
Ryan. You need to bring Kevin wu on. Please.
Reuploaded, so now I do know what to comment
Greg is one of my idols! Great episode!
You should put this podcast on apple music...
Great idea for the beginning Paco!
I love it when Ryan says that the video will be released before they talk about it haha
You guys are definitely the people I’d love to kick it with
@24:49 Greg saying "how?" in high pitched is weird.. ( it was Ryan or Paco's voice )
I know he said how? too, but faintly.
Who else couldn’t wait for this vid lol don’t read more 🔥 



 

Your 2019 is blllessed łíkè this comment and śùbśćríbé to activie ittt
Why don’t you make a separate channel for podcasts
Bring back step boiiiz
19:30 when they mention jenkem anyone remember that kevjumba skit? No? Just me? Ok.....
Everyone like the video so it gets to 69k and Ryan and Arden is going to react to agents of secret stuff
The amount of people who don’t know the difference between to and too is two damn high
Why not to make a podcast when you don't have any ideas anymore...👌
this might be Ryan's YouTube but Greg is the center of all the groups through the years
Talking about ghosts, yall remember that I DARE YOU you guys did in a snow cabin, and out of nowhere a baby hand started to form on the window? that was scary lol
69k likes guys, lets do it 😂
Dear Ryan can you please do a video about the Thor dogs
Greg: Origins
Hey Ryan it dear Ryan Can You bring bGa back
I been pulled by my foot multiple times to the point where i was thrown from my bed and my bf a definite sceptic came in the room one time when he heard me screaming and hugged me then felt and saw me get pulled out of bed and he tried holding on to me and pulling me back and ever since then he’s believed me which is nice to finally have someone else witness it and not feel like I’m going insane
This channel is going downhill...
Can you make Skitzo again please
Please put the podcasts on Spotify it’s only on ep 5
"this smells like ian"  😆
I love the growing up talk. I'm right there in that phase, trying to move to LA and pursue a career in film. It's really daunting, but it's nice to hear that you guys went through that too.
I know only 2% will see this I just wana say 😍 ❤️ 




Your gonna have great luck for 2019 łïké this comment and šùbśćríbê to me to activate.
I thought that he was going to show the cat: moomoo than the real pic
Guys i met will and greg in a restaurant  called island flavor today. Best day of my life.
Guys please increase the volume for speaking portions. When you all get in the groove discussing something, you get really quite and it becomes almost impossible to hear you while I'm commuting even with my volume cranked up. And my headphones are pretty noise cancelling too. I really want to hear all of it.
Ryan you have your old po box number in your about section
Who else clicked fast af?!🔥👀


I really want to hit 50,000 Śùßś. I’ll appreciate any support thanks for reading❤️🙏

Dear Ryan, is the lost city of Atlantis real?
“You can make something out of nothing, you don’t need to have all the skills... you just need the willingness and the drive” ty Greg for the inspo
21:42 How Deadmau5 came up with the name for the song

You don't get high off pee and poop...trust me...
Ryan just so you know I’m saving this for my drives to school and back and on the podcast app. Just warning you so you know when I click off this video and the YouTube watchtime chart graph thing changes other people might be doing it too
Damn I remember meeting greg with Ryan during his asia tour for youtube fanfest while they were filming clenching my booty. And now I'm in my last year of studying digital media just like greg and making my own videos/short films I'd like to believe it's because of watching you guys on youtube
We want Parkorse
shamWOOHOO is still one of my favs of all time
Dear Ryan, please do another BgA song!

WHEN IS KYLE COMING TO RHPC?????
40 degrees? Really cold? 40 degrees would melt all of our snow and we would call global warming.
I had no idea they danced!!
whitest guy I ever saw... im jealous
I hope the lower views isn't going to discourage you guys from continuing making these. Especially if this is something you guys enjoy doing. And I know it might be cheesy to say, but i'm happy this podcast gives me something to look forward to on Sundays. Like it really does brighten up my day. So I do appreciate you guys doing these!
audio's soft this time
Aww poor paco!!! Hes becoming one of my favorite
Greg's the man I had no clue he did all that work too. Btw Ryan check a map out Zimbabwe is a country in Africa.
I need an episode with Dana!
FOR GREG TO KNOW: There is an actually zombie like virus here in Canada that has infected wildlife. I think it was moose and deer. Apparently it’s contagious to humans but it’s not really that common or something
Y’all need to release some of those unreleased videos, I wanna get as much content from y’all as possible.
Dear Ryan: please make a my hero academia movie trailer :D!
someone know if the other members of the rhpc work? I mean the other rather than ryan do they have another work? Cause if yes probably it's hard to find time to do everything
23:00 It really pulls my sleeves when they miss opportunities
"we don't want you here"
Petition to bring back “cooking...but not really” all in favor say I
i dont wanna hate on ryan but why did he jump on the podcast wagon... i miss his creative vids man
Dear Ryan can you make a video about how Legos killed someone ??
40 degrees is cold? I wear shorts and a tee shirt when it’s in the 40’s.
Dear Ryan, could you rap without talking😉😉
Am I the only one super annoyed by the intro jingle?
i need greg's shirt

Eagerly waiting for the ghost hunting videos........

Dear Ryan, can you please make a tower out of fries. If you can, thanks. If not, oh well...
Which podcast did Ryan talk ab him and Sean ghost hunting in hawaii
Dear Ryan can you please shrink the time limit for the podcast, Everybody loves it that way,and also you get more views
i can relate with greg
Paco gotta move a little back from the mic, I heard his breathing for the most part.
Where did Ryan share his ghost story? I'd like to revisit that.
The only podcast i listen to
The whole time I was wondering why the intro doesn't make sense. Today watching it for the first time instead of listening, it finally cleared up that it's a preview of the episode
WE NEED GREG’S SHIRT
Greg looks like Mike Shinoda
Lets get this podcast on meme review so we can get 69k likes
Paco getting to what we really want!

Dear Ryan can you eat 10 crackers in 1:00 minute
All your videos are my favorite
imm tall 5 5 XD
Dude podcast is for people who have no creativity or talent . I subbed to this channel for the original sketches , not to listen to you and your friends talking
ugh, the momo pic fuked me up
Just because you cant explain somthing. Doesn’t mean it’s ghosts or god or aliens.
Please do more podcasts with gamers
Dear Ryan can you make a video prove that you're immortal
Its disappointing that you guys don't know Zambia, even the person who brought it up should have looked it up
you should invite Chester See
I have watched up to 54:21 because i am sick and bored.
Like this video!!!!!!! We want to see ARDEN and RYAN react to Agents of Secret Stuff !!!!! :) 💩💩💩
In MN its -5
Will BGA make a comeback!?
Love from INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I always hit like.
Momo and Jenkem are perfect examples of a moral panic.
I didn’t realize how much Greg and Will sounded alike until I listened to this podcast while cleaning my house.
What was Will's favorite video?
That ghost hunting video is the first nigahiga video I’ve ever refused to finish
Remember when this guy was actually funny
You should have finished college..
I clap like greg!! Yaaass
Only the people who have bin here for at least 6 year will get this podcast.
when is the will and greg show coming back???
god, 34:28 was so satisfying.
dear Ryan,remake how to be your favorite actor
Yo put me on the show and ill show you ghost storys my family has a ghost following it
Did they took down this video for some hours and re uploaded it again?
Dear Ryan PLS do if horror movies were 3, long
Damn the best podcast . They tell the history on how they met each other
Miss his old vids
Dear Ryan, can u make a captain marvel parody trailer?
The Momo sculpture was a combination of everything commonly scary. It had ridiculous hawk talons. Large eyes, inhuman smile, matted hair, claws; what could be scarier?
Ryan is an OG on YouTube and I’m an OG subscriber
Your dad is the opposite of my grandma. She knows how to answer a call, but she doesn't know how to make a call
paco is a good director
LOL fitz made fun of you
I remember when jankum was talked about a lot. Apparently you pee and poop into a bottle and tie a balloon on top and have the gas fill up the balloon and then sniff that
Sham-WooHoo
Momo? To-Love Ru?
1000th Comment!  Please honor my comment by deleting it Ryan
The sound in the video is very low
21:41 I think the exact same way!
Have dom on the podcast!!!!
Is this complaining hour?
I dislike the podcasts unsubbed because there just overflowing my sub uploads
Podcast with Merrell Twins
Looooovvveeeeee ittttt!!! Awesome seeing everyone lmao Paco
I remember those drug infused pop rocks when I was a kid too, and for a bit there I wasn't allowed to eat pop rocks either.
I think they're talking about the blue whale challenge instead of the momo challenge
Dear Ryan, can you do a RHPC version of Takeshi’s castle
Dear Ryan, can you please have a feature on your parents <3 XD

In the Philippines, one kid die because of this momo/bluewhale challenge.

It's reported all over the news. Then a lot of hoax just spreads just because of this incident. Then everyone's just becomes so wary with their kids being engage into social media or any online stuff.

These are all really stupid challenges if you'll see it. But kids can be manipulated easily. Not all, but some of them maybe. I just hope no other kids be inclined with these kind of things and be a victim.
This show is a copycat of logan Paul's show impaulsive
Lets hit that like button!

Do something like mumble music 8 grapes in my mouth
Looks like we won't be getting to 69k
Paco doesn't talk that much anymore
Dear Ryan, can you GTFO
Dear Ryan Can You Do Forthnite Dance

Wait who was josh again?
I wish youtube app had an only audio feature that can play in the background of your phone

What the heck i got an ad for Tylenol with the same red and blue pill they have as their logo

I would really love to see the BgA members have a podcast together. It's been ages since the last song and I'm keen to see everyone together again.

Really good episode
Anyone got lag'ey video?
Get D-trix on the next one
Haha :D
Dear Ryan can you make a parody of 7 rings
Greg Saniatan
Yeah paco is right we wanna see Arden and Ryan reacting please please please
Where can I get Greg's shirt?
Greg is cool
Ghosts don’t exist. These are inter-dimensional aliens. It’s not your dead grandpa people~ wake up!
They can make it funny without even trying
we call it shi shi here too in Malaysia
Anyone else hear how the whole Momo thing was made up by the government to give them a reason to introduce new restriction laws on platforms such as youtube?
I hate Paco for putting the picture of momo .You should understand that kids watch your videos
Soo... greg has testicles in his mouth? 0:15
If you guys didn't watch the entire episode, if this video gets 69K likes, then Ryan will do something.

dear ryan can you make portal 2 in real life
Dear Ryan what would happen if you could use 100% of your brain?
I just thought that paco got the noise machine because he was the smartest
If your battery dies or camera malfunctions, why is the first thing that people assume is that it must be a ghost. There are a thousand different conclusions you could come to before saying it's a ghost.
Apparently Arden is also off the pill so they are going to have a baby.
why is paco hosting?
I hate that pako make ryan doing something
Am I the only one that finds Paco so awkward to watch in this podcast lmaoooooo
Didn't Paco make a video of a ghost in his house? Or was it Roi?
Hi i am regular
Everyone like this video. At 69k likes Ryan and Arden will do a reaction video to Agents of secret stuff. Like this comment so others can know about this too.
I didn’t like the first 25 minutes
Where are the claps
It’s definitely out, definitely...
Greg seems kinda soft in this video
Dear ryan, i like you and your friends can you do the "lie detector test challenge"?
Hey, if you believe in Christianity, ghosts, zombies, angels, and demons do exist! And what's better is, the zombies are the good guys (although they won't be gross when they resurrect)!
here in the Philippines there are cases of suicide because of those  kind of challenges like momo  & blue whale ... so sad but it's true

Alright, we are 7 podcast in...... and because ryans trend of leading his viewers into something serious and end being a joke, i find it hard to take what they are saying seriously cuz im thinking that a joke is coming.........
There’s a hoax that goes around every Halloween, where these Facebook moms share this “these are dangerous ecstasy and edibles that people are giving out in the shape of vitamins and candies!” Like, Karen, no one is giving away their drugs to your snotty kid

Dear Ryan. I assume you are familiar with the situation right now. Pewdiepie need our help. It's now or never. Please text him if possible or someway let him know he is not alone. Hope you will help him. Peace
Where’s da vids
Where is Derrick?
Hi Ryan
33:25 WOAH
Ericka?????
Let me just say, Paco's such a good addition to this pod cast. I like how he keeps the conversation going between Ryan and Ian, and good transitions from topic to topic
“Ricegum hit me up, and he wanted to box me”
I bought a gun
This was perfectly edited
Like if D-trix needs to be in the podcast
Honestly, Paco should be Ryan's co-host. He is pretty entertaining to watch.
I love the intro
“Rice gum wanted to fight me”
“I bOuGhT a GuN”
Paco usually plays the stupid character but I really like serious Paco too I mean he's still really funny but he makes the conversation flow really well without overpowering it. He's a great co host keep him in the podcasts
Remember when Nigahiga was the most subscribed youtube channel? Good times

Thanks for all the likes guys!
Wanted Anthony Padilla as well. But okay I just want this to get views.

Next up Jenna Marbles.
Ian is actually an intellectual. His YouTube persona is very different.
Smosh and Nigahiga, back when youtube was good
crazy rich asian didn't do well in China or other asian countries because people are so used to the plot! The rich guy and common girl romance story is too over-used in the past 10 years lol
Loving the podcast! and Ryan don´t feel bad about sidetracking or going "of topic"!  It´s fun seeing you guys talk about random stuff, and if it gets too random you have Paco backtracking and taking control on the conversation. Keep it up!
We need a Jenna and Julian X nigahiga podcast crossover! PLEASE
The first half of this was reminiscent of when you get with an old friend from high school and you just talk about the memories and school stories you have
Ryan and Ian in the same room bantering with each other? 


  it's lit
2017: disstracks
2018: boxing 
2019: podcasts?
Remember how this guy used to be the most subscribed to YouTuber? The good times...
WOW rhett and link are literally the dads of youtube they saved ians ass thats amazing 
i looove that they did that!
The most ambitious crossover of the millennium
Like if kevjumba needs to be on the podcast
Ryan should host an rhpc roundtable discussion. As an episode for the podcast.
Two actual youtube gods.
Damn if Anthony was here it would’ve been 2008 all over again
Ryan is the least disliked you tuber he literallygets no dislikes
You can see a difference with the older generation of youtubers to the newer generation of youtubers
Wow really? GMM bought smosh
That's actually sick I kinda saw similarity between the style of their crew and stuff.. Glad to know that something good like smosh is in a good hand
Ryan should hit up Jay Park.
Who else was scrolling for usual list from Fall?

(Sorry, I just don't know how to mention people on Youtube comments)
they: Driving in L.A. is difficult


Indian roads: hold my ditches
Real question is: where did KevJumba go?
Wheres the guy making time stamps for each bit of the podcast? 😭😭
Kevjumba and Anthony on the upcoming podcasts for sure!
Can you make one with Derrick ;-:
I'm just saying... I'm loving the frequent uploads. Thank you. <3
We need more viewers for Ryan’s Off The Pill Podcast
47:27 Ryan talks about RiceGum
Racism is racism, irrespective of your skin color
Ryan do a face reveal we deserve to know after all these years!
I hate how the podcasts are the most less viewed videos, these podcasts are great
Dear Ryan, do some more dear Ryans :(
Is anyone here wondering why ryan deleted his new podcast?
*Remember kids
*

Stay in drugs
Don't do vegetables
Eat your school
RYAN x SMOSH
a dream come true!
I'd totally pay 💰 to watch Ryan and Ricegum in the ring. Just saying...😛
You are an OG YouTubed that slowly was taken over but still grinding MUCH RESPECT
28:16 for all the people who want to know about the past/current SMOSH situation
Taco Bell, ha. More like.......”PACO” Bell!!!!
Thank you for posting these podcasts. I’m really loving them. I listen to them while I’m at work and I love how I can just hit play and not have to worry about missing anything visual. It makes my time go by faster. ☺️
"This video is sponsored by the good people at smosh"
Kris Wu (the actor in XXX) used to be part of a huge kpop group called EXO, but he’s actually Chinese-Canadian and I don’t think he even has a Chinese’s citizenship anymore; so idk how much China actually cared about him being in the movie
If possible can you do parkourse videos again?
KEVJUMBA for OFF THE PILL!!! 💊
I'm willing to bet Defy invested into bitcoin and lost everything.
Dam... I just realized that i've been watching ryan since how to be ninja... Still love his content! Keep it up bro!
WHERE IS BgA BOIS BRO
9:42 That's ironic because without tourism Hawaii's economy would tank
More like Paco bell
Now have PewDiePie on the podcast
34:31 See, that's nuts to me. I remember when they did a literal compilation of smosh deaths at the end of every year. It feels like a staple.
I'd do anything to hear a song with Ryan , Chestersee and Kevjumba..
Man, i miss the golden age of YouTube
Not gonna lie, in Hawaii, Micronesians get a lot of racism LOL. It's mostly the baby boomer age people and idk why
Ian: The volcano was a big thing, It's pretty lit...


Ryan: Literally
criticism on a movie is to be expected, not really drama tbh
Dear Ryan: can you reanact your profile photo?
My opinion is definitely against guns but there are some circumstances that are acceptable. To be honest, I think having tasers are much more effective. They won't kill you but can stun you long enough for the authorities to show up.
I miss the old Smosh.
I miss the old Nigahiga
Nigahiga and smosh
👏🏾legends👏🏾
"It wouldn't be fair if it was MMA because you would just take him down and put him in some kind of hold"
WHO SAID THAT WOULDN'T BE FUN I WOULD WATCH RYAN TAKE DOWN FIFTY PEOPLE IN A ROW
Dear Ryan, 
Is skitzo coming back? I really miss Regina, R-dizzle, and Hanate.
Ian Defied Defy! Yay Ian! :D
I absolutely loved it. I feel like Ian and Ryan could really just talk about anything and make it interesting (as long as its not forced lol) They are so genuine and it showsssssss I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT
Love the direction your channel has been going in lately, all the extra content is a treat. Ian's always an interesting guest too, seen him on a few podcasts, seems like a really nice fellow.
Why new video is removed
This made my day (year) ❤️
So proud of both groups of creators!
Always great to hear you guys talking real like this.
Thank you for being there for all of us for all these years ❤️
Hello from Serbia
I have the same sweatshirt as Paco. Time to burn it now





(Joke)
I would pay double the Logan KSI fight to see Ryan crush Rice in MMA
Dear Ryan, how was The TEEHEE invented
So is LA, Miami 2.0 or is Miami, LA 2.0?
52:39
Ryan and the guys discuss the Ace family
YouTube has become so different. It was a peaceful community but has become a rebellious mutiny.
Man this week is amazing

The Jonas brothers are back

AND nigahiga with smosh together again
Where's the Timestamp dude?
We need you!
Smoshcast and off the pill are literally my 2 fave podcasts
I've been perusing YouTube since 2007, so this podcast was such a trip down memory lane. I love it. Does anyone else know of any other podcasts that talk about this kind of stuff?
Get bo on here. Bo burnham would be pretty cool to bring on the podcast.
Both these youtubers were once the #1 subscribed to channel 😭
Get Mr Beast on this podcast pls
Dear Ryan,
U should play in the 2020 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game pls
Is it only me or is the audio really low?
Good podcast though, I don't really love Smosh the way I used to, but I'll always support the cast and of course Ian, he's an amazing guy
the Chinese actor in xXx and Valerian, his name is Kris Wu, and he's also a hip hop artist, check him out, he's really good
Damn his new podcast got deleted
woAH i actually got an ad in the shi shi break. 
crazy times everyone
Hey Ryan!! When will the new episode of 'DUDE vs. WILD' come out?🤔👍

I really miss that series.😭
I think maybe he should try to get steven suptic here, that'd be cool
Whoa, what is this, a crossover episode?
8:10 yeah "reverse racism" is what that's called and its honestly a stupid term, it's literally just actual racism
What happened to his new video.. ghost busters podcast......I wanted to watch it cause I saw some spooky stuff on David dobrik's channel
I was like my phone is on 2%. Nah it can stay through this podcast I have to watch this now then my phone was like NOPE
Then I charged it.
The only thing that I see in all Ryan's podcast is his nostalgia...
I don't think that people should keep asking for Anthony to return. Anthony is doing is own thing and seems to be enjoying it.
Who is subscribed from when he was nr 1 on youtube
Dear Ryan,
Can u do an I Dare U with Smosh
I love that his only experience of rude foreigners was a Parisian 😂 So predictable.
The people behind the golden age of YouTube sitting together, it's a must watch
ryan: volcano is a bit more interesting
Ian : its Lit
Ryan : LITterally 
noone can outpun ryan
I thought Ian was Link for a second, before actually reading the name
Shout out to kevjumba!  Please. Please!  Bring him on this podcast
Ryan's ninja abilities would make him easily beat ricegum
"Ricegum wanted to fight me... I bougght a gUN"
This Ian guy should have a YouTube channel
Remeber when nigahiga and smosh were on the top of yt...
Dear Ryan,
Can you do more First World Problems?
i really enjoyed Parttimers!!!!! pls bring him back
BEST PODCAST YET! It's so freakin nostalgic and so dope to see my literal two favorite YouTube channels and personalities ever since I was a kid. Just seeing them evolve from the two funniest channels on YT to talkin about deep, complex issues and interesting stuff is just so captivating. Man it's just feels like I grew up with ya'll lol. Of course I've been a Nigahiga fan since day one, but I remember watching every Ian is Bored and Lunchtime with Smosh (the OG mukbang vids lol) video that came out, and all those second channel Smosh vids lol. Love u brotha Ryan and brotha Ian, ya'll are the best. <3 


PS. Maybe get Ian back with Anthony one day?
I always forget that they aren't in their 20s anymore 😂😂😂
Timestamp for topics please!
Please do a podcast with Jenny and Julien!!!
You should collab more. Watching this was like a flashback to more classic youtube
Dude I can't get enough of this podcast... I've watched every single one all the way through lol. Keep up the consistent uploads!
Kevjumba and Chester See please!
o.t.p.p
h.o.t.p.p
Planned on watching this at work but ended up watching the whole thing already. Gotta love the OG youtubers
My 10 year old self came out while watching this😄
Ian: "Hell no I've never been punched in the face before"
Paco: "Would you like to?" 
LMAO
Shout out to the 808 segment. :D
Dear Ryan, can u make a sequel of Kevin and mama (the refrigerators)
Favourite podcast by far
This video is sponsored by Paco Bell "don't you mean casadilla?"
I don't like smosh as a channel anymore and haven't for a long time, but Ian will always be just a likable, approachable and nice person in my eyes. Down to earth and not afraid to say what he wants to say, I love that.
Suggestion: Could you please have a camera angle where you see both people at once, it hurts my eyes that the camera keeps flipping.
I like watching your off the pill podcasts but sometimes i have problems knowing you have with you on the podcasts lol. it would be cool if you could like introduce the guests better! just constructive criticism :)))

Love your videosssss <3
I loved this.

I grew up on OG YouTube. Seeing you guys reminisce has me all nostalgic n shit
I thought when these people got old they would just be replaced but instead they make podcasts talking about how old they are. The three Rs i guess
Now don't ask Arden to be on the podcast
No joke just watched the hole thing 
Best 
Podcast 
Ever
Dear Ryan can you make a reaction video to any diss track of your choice but it has to be by another youtuber
dear ryan, can you make an Infinity War / Endgame trailer parody?
Can't we have a timestamp in every Off The Pill podcast please?
Having Anthony or Jenna Marbles on the podcast would be great!
This is my favorite podcast.
Ryan =Lit
2017- Diss Tracks
2018- Boxing Matches
2019- Podcasts
you just realize how old you're getting when you recognize all those name drop from first gen youtube
Mental how much these 2 people have had an influence on this website. And RayWJ. people dont know these days smh
Ryan on h3 podcast would be awesome
As always RHPC with the amazing content. I'd watch a 2hr or 3hr podcast Ryan, with you all being well rested of course, cause you've made interesting content for over a decade now. Keep at it man!
I love Smosh and Ryan HIGA
TEEHEE
SHUT UP!
Can you please bring KevJumba to the podcast?!
nigahiga and smosh were my first subscriptions and they just did a podcast together!?




👏*quality*👏*content*👏
OHHHHH YE BOI IS VIDEO IS GONNA BE LIT
What a decent podcast! Thank you, Sirs!
Damn, I'd love to sit down with you guys and chat about random topics

You're doing a great job, keep it up!
Good thing I saved about 1 hour and 18 minutes in my schedule for this



And after this I’m going to rewatch other nigahiga videos
I think none of you have driven in Seoul.
Smosh and Nigahiga were legit my favorite youtubers growing up
First podcast I enjoy watching

(Haven't watched smosh podcast yet)
These guys talking about Kris Wu.
Now there needs to be a smosh cast featuring Ryan higa
I love how you guys still make original creative content.
"jelly belly popcorn" -Ian
Best part 😂🤣😂
This is probably one of the best podcast I listen to
He deleted the latest one ? Or what?
Love the fact that I’m here on an OG youtubers Chanel as he chats with another even OGer youtuber who just broke the news to me that the OGest youtubers bought/saved them I love Rhett&Link for that foreal
Ian: I BOUGHT A SHOT GUN!!!!
ME:*thinks about that lone hillbilly guy with a pump-action in movie*
Hillbilly Ian:HASTA LA VISTA! BABY!!!!
This was a nice conversation that gave me nostalgia for old YouTube. P.s. their were a lot more types of firearms when the second amendment was written.
Omg I totally understand therackaracka conversation, their literally insane I’d be terrified to wrestle them especially because of multitude fight videos they have and the choreography
Its just my opinion but i think swoozie (Adande) would make a great guest for this podcast. Hope you guys bring him here.😁
You should invite Jenna Marbles
Podcast with Superwoman!
Owning a gun is a great privilege
Missed a chance to call Logan apologists "Logan a-Paul-ogists"
It would actually be fine if rice gum was on this
sees nigahiga -> instant click
This podcast is amazing. Having the best veterans on youtube decussing stuff is awesome
New history class in college: YouTube history! Love your podcasts!😁
6:14 Ian just ignores Ryan’s joke
The description says "their new home at Mythical Beast (Rhett and Link)"...oh no, Ryan. Mythical Beasts are what R&L fans are called. Mythical Entertainment is the name of the company. 😬
Yes! Please go on Rhett and link's podcast!  Or gmm!
Ryan keep doing the podcast! 
I really love it!
♪♬ It was the year 2005 ♪♬
♪♬ YouTube had just begun... ♪♬
Off the pill is the show that shows us how much paco's smartness shows on this show although it never showed in the other shows
I NEED to see the MMA match against Ryan and Ricegum now
Smosh vs Defy Media, both are amazing!
i’m so not used to podcasts being light like this bothers me.
i need DARKNESS in my life
Hey Ryan, I think a lot of people (me included) would love it if Arden came on the podcasts. Do you have any plans for that?
i don't suspect you would need to worry about that H3 podcast, Ryan.
the 2 hosts are really sweet
21m subs,+ 100k views = podcast.
You know someones from Hawaii when they say it cool
Dear ryan can you do a realtime trickshots?
E
Taco Bell or Paco Bell? .o.
Edit: Oh mah lord, the amount of likes, thanks!
Dear Ryan,

Can you please state the equipment you use in the description?
Anyone remember when  NigaHiga and Smosh were the best YouTubers in the world.
This podcast is every person who watched youtube in the early 2010's. 
Also make smosh great again
SMOSH IS OWNED BY GMM TEAM??? FCK YES!!! I used to watch GMM for half a year few years back until I just had no time for it. I believe in these guys!
1:02:33 "As the grandfathers of Youtube, you guys have been here for so long"

"We're dying. So old that we're dying!" LMAOOO RYANN
DEAR
Ryan can you make a video of a child suffering from exams
I saw a bearded man (I just scrolled by fast) Rhyan, and then a pill almost split in half.
Jacob Kept Scrolling
Jacob clicked the video
i love ian and anthony .. and smosh a lot. Ryan, great episode.
you should get simon miniminter on the podcast!
Ian talking about Kris Wu at 26:15~ 😮
If someone did a Sign Language cover of a song, I guess that would get copyrighted
Lol people here in Minnesota drive super nice!😂 we always have those awkward 4way stops. “No you go” “you got here first, you go!” “No I insist!”

We also wave 👋 thank you when they let you go as well😂😂
Ian is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Been a while since I've seen them together.
"miley is dating that hemsworth guy again".. dude they are married XD I love how you brought her up and how she is someone you can look up to now. :)
I LOVE YOU RYAN your videos are very inspiring and funny 🤣🤣
Oh man! you made ma day 
I have been chasing this colab for a beginning of smoshcast.

Edit:I am asian boy it's 7 am here.
Imagine a podcast with PewDiePie, Ryan Higa, Ian, and Ray William Johnson. They all had a moment of being number 1 at most subscribe, and their main topic should be about T series😂
“Its a really big sock.” ~Ryan 2k19
Ian catching himself cursing was killing me. 😂😂
6 videos in a month  WHAAAATT
Yo, get anyone from JKfilms/news on here!
just waiting for the patient person who puts the timestamps :)
Rhett and Link bought Smosh. My life is now complete. ☺️
Bring Julien to the podcast
Bro this made my day, I’m home sick and I LOVE off the pill. Perfect distraction for adhd girl whose “cleaning their room” and “doing hw”! Kept doin what u doin Ryan and Paco
I saw 'OTP' on the pill and as a professional fangirl who behaves unprofessionally and immaturely, I thought it was One True Pairing
Ryan on try not to laugh with smosh?
I remember youtube live. such a long time ago. in our perspective at least.
Honestly, YouTube itself should sponser these, this is YOUTUBE HISTORY BABY!
Imagine Hasan minhaj and Ryan in Off The Pill Podcast. 😍🥳
Why did you delete your off the pill part 7
Ian should join Anthony's channel, no one would've seen that coming
Bring kevjumba on the podcast
this gave me flashback when ryan used to appear in old smosh skits lmao
Well, I would like LA drivers to come to India and drive :)
FYI - There were more than just single fire muskets back when the 2nd was written.
lmao i was listening to smoshcast #2 this morning so i felt some deja vu when ryan brought up youtube live
How big can a Channel become??? All these channels of Smosh and Mr Beast etc. have an awesome Support from their Community. Wish that anyone would notice my Channel and help me grow up a littel bit...All the best from Hamburg/Germany
Peace
I would love to see Jimmy tatro on the podcast!!! Yall would have great conversations
43:23 Paco is really growing on me xD The delivery was so spot-on-serious.
The name is pronounced
(Puh-dee-yuh)
Or proper pronunciation
(Pa-dee-ya)
Its a very common puerto rican last name.
This was great, I love hearing old youtubers talk like old friends. Thanks for the nostalgia!
“Ian Hecox a shotgun” sorry but lmao this was clever
Well I had dinner , a walk and tea with this podcast .
I'm loving it !!!!!
"We went to the volcano, that was you know it's a big.."
"It's better now, it's a little more interesting now."
"a little more lit."
"LITerally"

I see what you're doing ryan, i see you 😂😂
Don’t stalk you tubers/ celebrities. They are human and they deserve privacy too!! Stalking is creepy and you don’t need to do it!!
Off the Pill is my OTP.
Anthony is gone🤟😒
with all the mentions on og youtubers... I would LOVE to c kevin on off the pill!!!
Legit, waste so much time in traffic on Oahu. I swear they're always trying to add more lanes but the traffic never gets better....
I’m 22 and I really looked up to all of these guys and have always been a huge fan. It’s so awesome seeing them in the same podcast. Love this!
This is my favorite podcast. Very interesting and insightful.
2017:disstrack 2018:boxing fights 2019: podcasts
just a small note: smosh's new home should be mythical entertainment in the description, not mythical beast! im really loving these podcasts, please keep making them! <3
lol, Ryan did not know what UI is although Hafu also mentioned UI in the podcast, I clearly remember her saying "UI, user interface"
Ryan, you should go on The Official Podcast!
Literally rewatched the new intro multiple times before continuing the video xD
I really enjoy listening to the podcast, no matter if it is funny like the ones before or more serious like this one. Thank you very much for such interesting content and the variety of videos on your channel!
Ian my man, the scene in Transformers that you mentioned was shot in Hong Kong not China my dude.
Put Arden on the damn Podcast already
I've been following this story on defy, never thought we'll have a podcast about it! Thanks for doing this!
Dear Ryan,
Can you please do “Naruto Mirror Run Challenge” please!!!
What if we made Agents of Secret Stuff Vol2 with Aidan's dad?
You should go on jenna and julian podcast too!
Please fight ricegum 😂🙏
Dear Ryan,
Can you do another “word of the day...” video?
This brings me back to high school, Nigahiga and Smosh were my go to youtube channels lol
Well you certainly didn't see a Indian driver who goes at 80km/hr in a 40km lane
Is there a chance to get an "off the pill" pillow? I would love one
the most OG youtubers in the same room
for a person who never watches/listens to podcasts, i am really entertained by the podcasts you've been uploading. keep doing what you're doing! also would be nice if u invited kevjumba i've missed him!!
Where’s the guy that lists all the time stamps?
I like hearing u talk but I never have time to fully watch all of your podcasts 😭
these are my 2 favourite channels
Top 10 anime crossovers
I thought it was Link from GMM at first until the name popped up and I don't know if it says a lot about men's style or me
Saddest moment in history 
Old YouTube stars making videos together
I love listening to these podcasts while drawing, please keep doing them
i just saw the whole video and realises it was and hour long (first time watching podcast)
Imagine the Smosh squad meeting RHPC
This video is the YouTube equivalent of the "Timmy, Jimmy power hour crossover"
I didn’t know Rhett and link bought smosh :0 omg💓
Never heard of this boxing thing but I wonder what Ian would think of Shayne Topp getting involved.
Man I haven't seen Ian in years. He reminds me of Paul Rudd now in this
Ian: "You and me are the only ones doing sketch comedy on Youtube"
Sadly there's a certain Lele Pons out there. Dunno if you can call it comedy though.
imagine a podcast with ian, anthony, ryan, pewdiepie, and jenna. all the og’s in one room
GET BRITTANICK ON PLEASE!!!
Thank you for the quick trip down memory lane, when YouTube was simple. Ryan was the first YouTuber I came across and have been watching YouTube since (2007). You started my love for this platform, for that I thank you. Seriously had chills and teared up when Ian said that Smosh was bought by Rhett and Link. That made my heart so happy as Smosh was another of the channels that I watched* in the early stages of my YouTube obsession 😂
Higa, Hecox and  Padilla. Am I in the wierd name convention ???
I’m super excited for the nigahiga and H3H3 podcast
Can you please get Bo Burnham as a guest star???
22:30 - yeap, that's true, BUT we are able to google those names, so don't worry ;)
Yoo ryan can you boost the voice volumes up by a couple decibels? Lil too quiet for my taste and its at max
I’ve been watching your channel for so long Ryan I even made my own channel. It’s amazing how much your channel has changed. This podcast was really interesting.
This is the number of people that will accomplish their dreams
👇



I would truly áppréçîáté á śûß🙏
I can already tell this is gonna be a great hour.
18:00 
YO HE’S TALKING ABOUT IHE
Dude , Ryan....your views are dropping....I'm worried bout ya mahn....😔

Guess it's cuz you only upload podcasts
But guess that's what you like
I hope less views don't mean trouble to you 😃
You should do a podcast with Jenna and Julien
21:42 * hears my name * wait wut huh. oh david choy. * confusion but at the same time i get it and its just one of those moments *
Logan Paul vs Ryan Higa in wrestling!!!
Pls do the truth about Bermuda triangle!!!!!! 
Love your videos!
Say what you want, Paco is really good on this podcast. He drives the conversation well.
As a mixed kid living in Hawai’i  (Ka’u area actually!) I can say that things have gotten better here lately, but Ryan makes a good point about the melting pot effect. Everything else, I agree with Ian on. If you’re kind to people, aware of your footprint and are respectful and conscientious about the history here, people tend to return that respect. It was nice to hear him be so balanced about the whole thing. What a great collab.
Wow, these podcasts are really entertaining! I was like: "Oh, a podcast? Great..." but I wasn't expecting to sit through the full hour, and have it go by so fast. Paco is a great addition, and just listening to Ryan and Ian talk is fun.
You know, I really enjoy these podcasts lol
Australia is bigger than Pluto !
Who is Christina Aguilar
My favorite Youtubers in one podcast omg
Ian Hecox??


yeah, he cox.
Still watching Cory to this day! Liveeachday
Great Vid Ryan! But this is a question to the Comment section 

(genuinely) how do you promote your channel online without seeming shallow?
you should invite Arden😏
Do a podcast with Chester See!
I also really appreciate how informed Ian is about how the tourist movement and how the housing problem is really affecting us Hawaiians tho fr fr
Never thought Paco would be the most deep and insightful person is the podcasts, keep it up!
When Paco works at taco bell= Paco Bell
Just telling everyone Anthony is going to the next mr beast challenge... just saying
But for real though, where's that burger place, you got me hungry
Incase you also forgot...

His name is Scarce
Omg man crush Ian...lovvv
IAN AND RYAN HIGA!!!!
RYAN LOST SEAN
IAN LOST ANTHONY



FUTURE DUO!!!!!!!!!
hmm is that energy drink in the bottom corner a tease for his new energy drink?
Please, Put SMG4 on your 'off the pill podcast' show, Ryan Higa.
I know it's late but SHI SHI BREAK 44:42
you should have Logan Paul on your podcast
I’m turning 19 later this year and I feel old, I’ve been watching Ryan for about 5-6 years, damn time flies
You guys should get Susan from YouTube to come onto the show and complain about YouTube
Paco Bell anyone? No? Just me? Ok...
Nice to know a celebrity shares my first name
That BgA cap, you bringin it back or what?
I think it is great that Paco is on the podcasts, he deserves more screentime just because he is so hilarious and a very good co-host
Thank you Ryan for supporting Smosh and having Ian come out!!!
Man being in the UK makes me so happy when listening to gun control discussions - because 95% of people don't have any weapon whatsoever it makes it completely unnecessary to own one
Only if Anthony Padilla was here. :(
Holy shit he mentioned Bo Burnham (15:09) I'm super hooked on his stuff right now.  Does Ryan know Bo Burnham?
Omg, Derrickcomedy's videos... good times. Wow, really cool podcast episode. Was very.. nostalgic talking about the days way back on YouTube. :)

Winecone.. ahh, all these names.. You guys are killing me!
Thay talk about China like its a person
Ian said the f-word, I'm telling the teacher!
I wanted Shayne’s laugh in the background 😂
Long ago the youtube channels lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Youtube Critics attacked. Only nigahiha, master of all creative expressions, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished, a week passed and my sister and I discovered RyanHiga, and although his YouTube skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone, but I believe that Ryan can save the Youtube World. Que epic music!
im canadian and liberal and im totally agreeing with you on your gun control views lol
Rhett and Link are so clutch good gracious
What about Ian Hercox? What happened to gender equality?
my two favorite YouTubers from 4th and 5th grade
Seeing u on earbiscuits (Rhett and link's podcast) would be really cool ngl
PLEASE DO ANOTHER BOYS GENERALLY ASIAN MUSIC VIDEO PLEASE ITS BEEN TWO YEARS!!!
ryan should see mattjacobwilliams video
You guys hitting me with the nostalgia feels. I still watch Cory (and Phil of course) to this day, missing the good ol days
The topics would actually flow together well until paco says it flows :|
If you bring Geared Way AKA Lead singer of My Chemical Romance then I will mail you a trophy that says OFF THE PILL.
Wow he said Guam. I'm from Guam (: LOL
I know I can rely on Ryan Higa's every Sunday Off the Pill Podcast!
paco cannot relate to youtube live when ian and ryan were talking about it
hence, the silent paco
xD
I 100% do not blame ian for buying a gun. As big as he is, he definitely has some crazy fans that dont understand the boundaries between creator and fan. Yall better stay safe
it's like my two step dads talking about me and me being YouTube the troublesome child
What happened between ian and anthony I tried do my research but not really explaing what actually happened because begining of video they were like we dont say his name here.. So they get into a fight or something and thats why he left smosh?
Taco Bell + Paco =
OG youtubers
Paco still killing it.
Ryan on the official podcast would be interesting
they are totally wrong about logans podcasts there has been some crazy moments but it nothing like howard stern and usually is just people sitting around talking like this
I don't get updates when you post podcasts :(
You should have d-trix/Dominic on here
bro imagine if ryan and rice had a fight they would grab sleeeeves
Time for some internet!
.....
"Logan Paul... is extremely talanted."
....
enough internet for today!
Where's the timestamp guy?
RYAN HIGA SHOULD JOIN SMOSH PART TIME IN ANTHONY'S PLACE!
Dear Ryan, why is Paco always Hugging pillows?
In before RyanHiga and H3H3 do a podcast crossover
26:28 That's Kris Wu!!!! He's the best I love him!!!
Dear Ryan make a last of us parody with puppets
it would be fun to see how Ryan wrestles a pro wrestler or ufc fighter or something, but like friendly of course xd
Have never watched smosh... But damn, I wanna watch their podcast now!
YouTube is getting so ridiculous...
I would boycott it but that would only hurt my favorite creators...
Could do the tour for pidcast in LA with Arden
smosh were the ones that taught me how to swear/curse (when I was in elementary school)
Two of my favourite Original Youtubers
47:30 Rice Gum
53:23 Logan Paul
Two old rivals in 2009,10 years later,both are in one room
I love these podcast. You can see a whole new side of Ryan. You guys need to do a Teehee Time and Parkourse. It's been too long
Even Jake had the samething after Shane's documentary. But nope just same old content after all that.

Runs in the fam
Go on the try not to laugh!
Hey Ryan can u go a date with Arden no jokes,puns,trolls and post it in your channel
I’m a big fan of this podcast. It’s dope...this comment sounds super generic.
Please have Kyle Higa, Arden Cho and the Merrell twins on the podcast!
love watching these during homework lol
Ryan should have a podcast with marley, yes.. marley the dog
I wish it could be Tabo Productions again
Wait... What if Anthony joins RHPC?
have you ever seen these two in the same room?
2 youtubers i used to watch when i was 12 on 1 video. perfect.
I hope ryan knows this is good stuff. Don t give up
I know I’m not a YouTuber and only YouTubers may understand, but I don’t get why people like RiceGum or Jake/Logan Paul (if it’s true) feel they need to make a persona to get up there. The fans really are the real problem to push the person to be that kind of person or do that kind of stuff. 😬 Or maybe they are that kind of person, I wouldn’t know. I’m not into those kind of contents and I don’t understand them. I don’t know where I’m going with this, asdfghjkl but it’s frustrating.
Ian having a gun is totally understandable and I think everyone should be able to acknowledge that.
Can you pls bring Sean back
You should have also called Anthony.
bruh, he's posting every few days now
I feel like that sort of YouTube collaboration still exists in the medium-scale channels in some cases. You see people like Dunkey and NakeyJakey mentioning each other, or William Osman and Michael Reeves literally living together. It's just a lot scarcer nowadays.
The only Pod cast I watched from A to Z the whole pod cast
YAY Ryan to H3podcast!!! :D
That Ian guy... His bowl cut is sexy , emo hair would suit him tho i think
Here is another comment to enlarge the number of comments in the comment section .
What if Ryan got t series’ subscribers so we could all live in peace
Please bring "the truth behind..." back
Ryan, can you please not drop F bombs because I love your vids but I am not allowed to watch stuff that has the F and S word. Pls & Thx!
Sucks you were the. Biggest YouTubers years ago love the old days 👇like if you remember
Can you make a Mission in-possible trailer but instead of mission in-possible it’s Ryan in-possible
Not sure if it would be on brand, but if you’re thinking about having Asa Akira on the podcast, try also having Bobby Lee or JKNews on. Bobby Lee knows Asa. And they are hella funny
Hope you ask/get Kevin to join you on a podcast. Would love to hear his whole story about everything
17:43 for those here from JARCAST.
Really nice to see the OG'S of YouTube still making vids
is that headset the kingston hyperx cloud alpha
ryan was wearing a BgA cap, why didn't they talk bout it, they both have good music reputations, at least a bit
Ah....the original kings of youtube
dude listen to them. ian is giving some solid advice for ya @Ricegum
We need weapons to protect ourselves from evil deranged people and not have the government start a CIVIL WAR
People on the comments who try to put shame on them about guns probably loved FPSRussias videos
We need a BgA song!!!
Great podcast 👍
Since you talk alot...  
Dear Ryan,  can you talk without moving your lips for a day??
Age really caught up to Ian, but he’s looking nice
"Off the Pill" makes me think that Ryan stopped his birth control xD
Ian is talking about Kris Wu at 26:30! He was both in XXX  and Valerian 😍😍😍
UMG is watching everyone's videos.
Please keep this going as long as you can (I want to write "forever" but I try to be a supportive fan so yeah ehehe). This is so good to relax my mind, doing other things and get into people different mindset ~~~
Smosh and Nigahiga

*the good old time *
42:03 first ever f-bomb on this podcast
You should end it with the guest giving a TEEHEE
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
Upload the Derrick Off the pill podcast
9 year olds from Pewdiepie watching Ryan higa and friends talk about old YouTube friends 
:*who*
Ryan.. Can you please add subtitle? I like so much your videos but sometimes I lost some word. And I think yor video can be use to learn english for many people like mw around the world.
i love the fact that nigahiga was worried about the h3h3 pidcast
Hi ryan im arabian i love your vidios nicee!! 😗😗

RIP Ian bowl haircut
I don't think that's true. I seen I am number 4 (I think that's the title) in China and it didn't have any Chinese people.
If there was a ricegum x nigahiga boxing match Ryan would break his noodle like body
Hyperx cloud alpha II nice same as me
Off The Pill>Impaulsive any day of the week!
Yeeeeeeees queen
WOW ryan and ian. my legit parents. thank you guys for making amazing content to enjoy since i was a little kid :') seriously thank you guys!
When I watch the podcasts I sit at a desk with 3 monitors, a mic , and put on headphones so I feel like I'm in the room as a quiet guest
Ian's actually such a smart and intelligent person. Very sharp
I love this my two favorite youtubers
I love this but it’s not getting enough views guys we get to see are favorite creator speak being himself guys watch these podcast
Yassss podcast moderator paco my man ftwwww!!!!!
Dear Ryan,play the game Jump Force
2:19 now I know where he lives
DROP A BGA COMEBACK
Damn this makes me sad this is throwback to grade 4 like 8 9 years ago
Shi shi is actually a childish way to say wee in Bengali so that works out well!
Ian just be like: I bought a gun
Ian was such a good guest and funny. So good to hear a more inside story
UI was mentioned 2 podcasts ago, come on Ryan.
I agree with Ryan that people can definitely be racist against white people because the definition mentions absolutely nothing about power dynamics; racism can happen to everyone. The power- argument can however come into play when we talk about oppression, and I think a lot of people mistake the word "racism" with the word "oppression". You can be racist against white people, but white people aren't oppressed, which is why many white people, including me, don't really feel that affected when someone is hateful against their skin colour, and why many people argue you can't be racist towards them.
Dear ryan can you make a video without editing
Really enjoying all your podcast even though I'm a couple of generations older than you all! Would love to see you on Rhett & Link! Do it Ryan!
Ryan confirmed for Try Not to Laugh?
List of guests I NEED on the podcast.
Arden
Daina
Merrell Twins
DTrix
Lilly Singh
Emma Chamberlain
Shane 
Pewdiepie
More Sean
Jackson Wang (if possible lol)
I would literally just wake up and watch nigahiga and smosh allllll day
aight, I'm going to work. I was up to 53:20 Will be back to watch this podcast.
I can't get enough of these podcasts.
Kris Wu was the Chinese actor in Return of Xander Cage and Valerian!! Just had to fangirl a bit when Ian mentioned him! Also Congratz Ian for finding Smosh a new home! I'm excited for what's to come!
I would like to see Bo Burnham or Shane Dawson on the podcast
Like if you agree
these were two of the best channels back in the golden days of yt
Ian Hecox is, a Scientist.
Next podcast with arden cho
Dear Ryan I am starting to like your podcast more and more keep it up bring more YouTube star 😉 and some movie celeb and tv star i know you are loved and they will be stoked to be in here .All the best.
It’s so weird seeing Ian all mature! lol Happy to see things turned out well for him!
Ok, gotta ask. Where the xixi thing came from? Because that does means pee in portuguese.
I feel a familiar space here and it was as if I was there, nodding along, with old pals. OG Youtubers here.
I am gonna say the N word
......



NigaHiga
You should really do this with Anthony
I think we can all agree that Ian and Anthony reverse unoed and now Ian is hotter
Mothafakr boi I was born n in 06 u finished high school in 05?????????
Anyone else catch paco say it’s in the name
Ian He Cox
I speak Spanish, and it's actually Padi-eeh-uh
Syndicate is my favorite example of shit person, but puts on a family friendly persona and is great guy to his friends.

Not everyone has morals. Some people just don't feel bad when they scam kids out of millions *shrug
LITerally 😂😂😂
Ryan plz play minecraft with your friends
i like these podcasts
*grabs beer and snacks while watching this
Oh my god I thought I was the only one with driving anxiety like that.
Skitzooo again pleaseee Ryan. SKITZO! SKITZO! SKITZO!  SKITZO!
You need to do one with Arden Cho!!
It's kinda funny how Smosh made a "every podcast ever" video and now he Ian is in Ryan's podcast
Are Ian and Anthony still even friends? Like they said they were "chill" or whatever but I literally have not seen them talk since Anthony left Smosh. It actually breaks my heart. If anyone else here is an old smosh fan, you know what I'm saying.
Ian is a complete virtue signalling SJW... He can have guns cause HE needs to protects himself... but other people...
They had such a good chance to say paco bell
*Ryan has a girl friend!
ayyy kauai best island lets goooo
yikes the fact ian was able to get a shotgun so easily is actually concerning... (i don't care he has one by the way its definitely reasonable, its just the fact he didn't need to go through any extraneous process to get one that's concerning)
Smosh the movie was gold
I live in Vegas. I can confirm. People here just go out in the desert and shoot all the time.
invite wonfu productions or dtrix next-
Am I the only one who noticed the BgA cap? Maybe a sign for a comeback??
Ryan should go on hot ones🤣
Dear Ryan... do you know beatboxing? If u know , what is your reaction about it?
Dear Ryan Can You do the life of a bed.
Well this is good and SAD at the same time. As more and more popular people start doing podcasts smaller podcasts will keep getting more ignored as most people would spend time listening to popular YouTubers.
Good as they can bring more people to listening podcasts.
Does anyone of you remember Josh Golden?
Ryan and co should go on Try Not to Laugh tbh....
The biggest OGs come together
would like to see ian and anthony again :(
Ian hecox its like how to say the word peacock right?
"i dont think weve ever even raised our voices at each other" awwwwwwwwwwwww
Can we get YTF on a podcast?
Smosh: makes every podcast ever 

Nigahiga: join my podcast
top 10 most ambitious anime crossovers
I feel like when you talk about China you should differentiate between what the state want/think vs what the people what/think.
Impulsive is pretty good when you watch the whole thing out.
Get andrew yang on the podcast!
Paco is sexy :)
You really should watch some of Logan’s podcast, it actually goes into mental health and he has actually matured or gone away from that persona he had.
this whole podcast was just a huge nostalgia wave, I feel like I'm 14 again
makes every podcast ever  second day goes to a podcast
Ian made rich people impression as if they are not rich people themselves 😏
When Paco makes a Taco stand-PACO BELL
you should invite Bethany Mota to the podcast
I love these podcasts! I think they’re my favourite thing on nigahiga right now :D so fun to listen to as I’m on the road
23:23 eugene lee yang
Old school youtubers talking about the good old days of youtube? This is awesome
When you're early but cant think
 Of anything creative to say
Agent of secret stuff 2??
IAN BASICALLY QUOTED THAT BO BURNHAM SONG HE PLAYED AT YOUTUBE LIVE


"The best youtubers are either asian or they're gay
so theres an untapped youtube celebrity and his name is George Takei"
"I am one of those"
When Ian said Google maps, my Google assistant popped up
Whose arden chay?
Imagine you captioning this video
Don't cuss... It's not cool. Please Nigahiga I love the podcasts....
In Canada, you can start drinking at 18 or 19
Love this exchange! Thanks for doing this everyone. I’m really enjoying Ian opening up about this experience with Smosh. It’s going to be great to see him in a leadership role for Smosh I think. Thanks Ryan!
Scarce is the name you’re looking for 46:28
You both used to be #1
gosh.. just to hear smosh and anthony in the same sentence blew sand in my eyes.
Sad to know this channel used to ne the most zubbed to on yt
Nigahiga has to get on Try Not To Laugh maybe Anthony in one episode too?
WHERE IS KEVJUMBA
okay now this is epic
Once the no 1 youtuber.....still great.
1 view I think something's broken
im still subbed to thewinekone lol
Can we please just have like all the old YouTubers in this podcast one by one if possible?? I loved today's podcast.
I dare you ft smosh
Logan Paul doesnt even follow him on insta smh
The only thing Defy Media managed to defy was creators' expetations of getting paid.
I'm sittin here thinking bout my age
dont act like you dont do that
This is tooo gooood
ian is such a legend i love him so much
The rudest person abroad he’s met is a guy who said I speak English some of the times? Lol what
So smosh is already part of mythical beast??
i saw rice live on wild & out and like he's really normal and lowkey shy without a set script. like even in between the takes lol just a regular guy but his vids are wild HAHA
I think we’re experiencing a new phase of YouTube: Youtube Rebirth
Best podcast ever
Tell him that does he have Anthony's number
You were the king of YouTube in 2011
GET KEV ON THE PODCAST!!!!!!
Jesus everyone’s doin podcasts now
Dear Ryan, can you do a parody of 
gangam style?
Have Anyone seen the whole video already?
dude ryan you need to do something BIGGER than other youtubers
He’s talking about Kris Wu
Guys I found a tiny YouTuber that's actually kind of funny. I'd love if they took off cuz I think they deserve it. Maybe check them out? It would be cool if they took off. @WeakStemmedPlants
I went from living and driving in LA to living and driving in Japan. Now that is night and day traffic. Lol.
Ayyy who else thinks that Ian is the best in smosh!! 

Amazing vid Ryan!! You have inspired my content and channel :)
8:50 you know what they say, les parisiens n'aiment que les parisiens
leadership in smosh? dude you ARE smosh, you can leave and make a new channel, and we'd literally all go to it, only here for ian and anthony, don't care or know the other people
I don't have any desire to go harass Ian, but I do wish they had said the burger place name because it sounds delicious.
New BGA single. Please.
Can’t wait to watch a podcast with Smesh!
miss this kind of corperation
Never knew about Rhett and link thing that is great
damn that explains why the video after that guideline went a bit worse than before
this podcast is awesome. there is potential that ryan could bring more special guess. personally I would love having pewdiepie here having conversation with ryan.
As a Filipino, i read anthonys name with the l, like Padilya
Thumbs up if you watched and recognized all the name drops
Dear ryan
What are your thoughts about South Africa
yo ryan invite kevin to podcast
Did you know flies did not exist in Hawaii until people brought them there from the US with planes.
like how they hide the hyperX logos
Crazy Rich Asian played in China. Source: Expat in China
thanks for helping the channel
I just realized I literally grew up with you tube cuz I was born in 05
everyone on this podcast except paco held the title of number one most subscribed yt chanel
You can tell he is not trying to make fun of "He cox"
They've met Bo Burnham. My two worlds are colliding
Look another channel tht became only about podcast basiccaly
Wi don’t want to go to hawaii now after what Ian said about Filipino racism
ryan wrestles one of the pauls
GO DO H3 PODCAST!!!
I found out this summer that I'm 25% Mexican cuz I'm adopted
I didn't know Rhett and Link were the ones that took Smosh. Lotta respect for them.
47:30 Ryan talks about RiceGum potential boxing match ?
Still follow TheWineKone
Please collab with ian in a video
I wouldnt call a guy who assulted and broke someone else's phone "just a shy, nice guy". Granted it was a while ago, but action speak for a person's values way more than words :/
I didn't even recognize Ian Hecox anymore. watched Smosh vids like 10-7 years ago and then stopped and now saw him after all that time!
Omg Ian ... what the freak you don’t need a SHOTGUN to protect you 😱😱  your Americans are weird .... that’s the dumbest logic “ whAt If the OtHer pErsOn have handgun ... then I need a shotgun” 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ sorry not sorry 😐
Duuuuuuuude thewinekone shout out! What's up!
Rice gum vs Ryan higa in boxing lol
I want to see Arden cho on here!! (After the last video TEEHEE) 😂😁
Cory Williams ftw!!!
duuuuuude so many trowbacks in this podcasts!!! i was subscribed to everyone they mentioned!! first gen youtube was so... friendly, no drama, everyone creating and being happy... gosh... simpler times.
You should have rice on the pod cast
Please do another episode of parkourse.
Dear Ryan can you do more anime stuff
Podcasts are my favorite type of entertainment because we get to see each person experience throoughout thier whole life and perspectives to what they view in each of thier own experience and get to see thier true selfs without acting so fake for the sake of the camera. Ryan Higa will always be my favorite YouTuber cause of how he handles YouTube and stays to himself.
Est-ce que vous parlez anglais?
If I had one wish, I would change all "Im" 's at the start of podcast names to "Re"
Is ryan aware that the off the pill podcast videos have thounds of views but other vids have millions? What could that mean?
Have Anthony on next
P A C O B E L L
Why hasn't Ryan done his part yet? 🤔
YOU GUYS SHOULD MAKE A SKIT WITH IAN!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I really enjoyed this episode and think you guys should never be afraid to talk about any topic, I’m not saying you guys should force yourselves to talk about certain things but be free guys!
well where im from, we read Padilla as "padilyah" but the rest of the double l words, we read it as how a native would say em
Guy who comes out behind a tree= John Scarce
2010 Asian YouTube was an amazing time
wait so covers aren’t allowed anymore? someone explain kanskajakkajxka

I miss the smosh “SHUT UP!”... I bought the button on the App Store when it came out, but you sadly can’t use it anymore
generic gun control comment
“Anthony’s coming back”
OMG IAN?? It got even better. This is an hour I won't be wasting.
For evry europian we need you in the fight vs ,,Artikel 13 and Artikel 11" please inform you and make demonstrations in your country also the youtuber please make videos about it and go to this demonstrations. On the 23 March there are many demonstrations in whole europe. We need all of you or it will kill the internet. Please make a video about it because many european don't know about it.
I THINK SMOSHOO I BETTER THEN HEGA
Ian is definitely a lot better then Anthony, at least now...
So much nostalgia for me right there good old youtube times
42:05 this ain't the first time sb dropped the f-bomb on the podcast
"Paco"bell
Ian is a really nice guy because he finish last...
Bring YTF to podcast!!!
Do it with PewDiePie 😂😂
Paco worked at Taco Bell? Does that make him.. Paco Bell?
Ryan can you have a podcast in which you talk about guns and military stuff please.
Paco between two legends
Have H3 on on go on his that would be cool
Yo  I️ live in Sacramento and commute everyday, the cluelessness is so real y’all
16:30
Remember guys, this guy wrestled Ian while he was in the blue suit
Dear Ryan do another parody for Stephen Kings IT.
I loooove ian!! So down to earth.
COME ON WE NEED TO GIVE RYAN A I HELPED SHIRT
Ian is such a sweetheart.
Who remembers when they were fighting for number one. LOL
So much honest real talk and humour and interesting topics. And I'm a girl (albeit quite a bit older than you guys) so contrary to what you guys think there are some of us listening!
kev jumba next guest?
Can you bring back parkourse
Two legends
Can Kevjumba be the next guest please!!
i watched the whole thing for the teehee
Paco needs to be in every Podcast
Definitely have to do the H3 podcast! The community is great!
Sad that he sold his channel away. Completely ruined the brand
I better not get a refund when you and rice go
Dear Ryan, can you have Shane in the podcast?
Ive been to i oahu honalulu
Taco worked at Pacobell? cool.
stop sayin the n word
Oh wow, when youtubers knew everyone then, compared to now.... the nostalgia hit when I remember watching the YouTube meetings or youtubers shooting their trip to YouTube hq
Please? Parkourse part 13?
Good to see my two favourite sketch comedians doing another collaboration
29:32 "that company would be known for killing smosh"... that company is already known for ruining it, what more can it do.
43:15 you guys should do a chess boxing match instead of just a simple boxing fight
box him it would be fun
It was Scarce vs RaccaRakka
For some reason I want Ian and ryanhiga to host meme review
Dear Ryan, Can you complete other "Dear Ryan"s in a horror theme?
I miss old youtube
talking about kev, are you gonna do off the pill with kev?
This is like a parent meeting, except the kids are now the parents/adults and they are meeting instead.
I can just imagine ricegum bribing the judge with money and flexing at the same time
I love this Paco guy he's kinda so cute
who watched the whole podcast
Ian says that when you visit a place or move there you have to respect the cultures and traditions wich i think is very true but shuld'nt the same things aply to imigration and how we need to let their cultures be but at the same time still try to interegate them in to the existing culture so that we don'nt get situations like in sweden where we have areas like rinkeby or rosengård wich are completly isolated and were you get more use of speaking arabic then swedish and ambulances get thrown rocks at by muslim gangs that control the whole area. Just a thought
Old school podcast. Love it! I love having the skits and podcasts. All these guys have inspired me to make my own content too!
Dear ryan I bet you'll never put this in a video, but if you do can you roast marshmallow. TEEHEE
Your name caught me off gaurd--
to think they would start the conversation talking about my Island, which is definitely a tourist spot....but idk i feel like there's some sort of misunderstanding about the racism?? Not proud of it, but makes sense since white people were the first to invade and ruined our lands and brought diseases that killed many hawaiians. They took over...like legit over threw the last queen. that's how they taught us in class.
24:11
You don't say his name, dude.
Ryan I request you to make a video "Truth behind PewDiepie vs T-Series
I would appreciate some censorship based on what I expect from your videos. It's a nice break to not have to hear it here.
Get Elon musk on OTP
WAN Show podcast has sponsors
There is racism toward white people, at least toward haoles. To say it can't happen is a lie. I didn't like seeing haoles strutting around like they knew everything about Hawaii just because they watched Magnum PI or Stitch.
the throwbacks in this episode tho
Anyone else here from Kauai?
Dear Ryan can you make a DORA TRAILER
Yesss !! Another off the pill podcast .Thank you for being so consistent with these. ❤❤❤
Wheres anthony 😂😂
more like paco bell
You should get Anthony on
I thought he was Will with glasses lmaoooo
What do you know, it was Smosh that inspired Ryan Higa!
Can you get the lady who also played your love interest in videos a bunch of times (not Kina or Arden)? I don't know what her name is but she looks half-Asian lol
audio is off for me
What they think the comments will be like: YOU GUYS THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE GUNS!?!?
What the comments are like: PACO!!! 😍😍😍
17:37
Ohk so i don't know about other films from different countries, but i can say that there is audience in China for Bollywood, i.e. the main  movie industry of India. There are some films in India that will do  average at the box office, but in China, it will be a blockbuster. 
(Just a piece of information which i wanted to share)
Just a reminder to listen to the nice guys 👍
37:26 Y'all heard that, so now you can shut up about Anthony coming back to Smosh
Now this is epic
oh dang i cant wait for you to go on h3
Is there a place for Ian in RHPC?
I bet that volcano was on Fire
You should be in the next smosh try not to laugh
BRING BACK SKITZO!
I miss Bratts and Beratta now. :(

Dear Ryan can you do a bottle flip challenge
Dear Ryan 
Can you roast India?
it's been how many years since they've been on camera together
we need arden cho and daina on the podcast please.
Make Smosh great again
Nigahiha still the legend
They should have said ASamaritain
Everything that he say is true
In my country, we pronounce "Padilla" as "Padilya"
Ian + Ryan = childhood T___T
Ian should ask anthony if he wants to come back to smosh now that they basically get to make whatever content they want. that would make my year
Wish your audio was louder
I missed sean soooo much!!!😞😭
where all my k poopers at
I see Ian still feels hurt over IHE reviewing their movie.
Does anyone realize that this is nigahiga and half of the original smosh? For me this is apart of YouTube history.🤗
Guy Tang is a gaysian creator
Please keep the soy boys away from the pod cast. This one sucked
ian been punch in the face by Anthony  before
Ian wears glasses now? Rip smosh hail Ian and Anthony
Why do people think it's acceptable to go to a person's house and film through the window? Famous or not, they're people with rights and privacy too.
36:45 Ian talks about anthony
I feel so bad for Nigahiga since he used to be number one youtuber in the world
being born and raised is absolute hell. lots of people are bad drivers, lots of school shooting threats and actual fights that lead to many injuries and possible deaths
Is paco bell owo
You know, i’ve tried to argue against gun ownership, but as i thought about it, i realised all arguments i could come up with, can be made also about martial arts. So while i remain convinced that it shouldnt be as easy to get a gun, as it is in the usa, and that there should be more control and so on, the only thing i can really conclude is that its very much depending on the individual person.
Can you do a movie you guys doing old memes
46:00 i am like how did ryan know
Where's Fall with the timestamps lol
'Jellybellypopcorn'😂😂😂
We need iddubz on the cast

Wait, were they joking about not knowing scarce?
Paco worked at Taco Bell? Paco Bell

Dear Ryan can you make ASMR?
26:29 His name is Donnie Yen! Do people not watch Chinese kung fu movies??
43:23, what you haven't got punched in your face,  as far as I remember you got punched in your face by Anthony which resulted you cracked your nose.
Please go on h3h3 Ryan
Crazy Rich Asians didn't do so well here in Asia in general as well because the story is kinda overdone and formulaic and everyone's seen that story almost way too many times in TV series, be it in China, Phillipines, Indonesia, Turkey, Malaysia, etc
Time stamp person wya
I lived on Oahu for a year and in school got bullied a lot for being white. From my experience the locals like tourists because they brought in money but if you were white and stayed there they did not like it at all.
More Ian more Ian more ian
MARRY ARDEN ALREADY
Is the Chinese actor Ian’s talking about (for Xander Cage and Valerian) Kris Wu? That’s actually interesting, I didn’t know foreign films in China worked like that

Paris has a lot of ruuuude people, and I'm French, and I live in Paris. People are cold but when you know them, they're actually nice. But yes, at first French people in general seem to be a lit bit cold and selfish.

PLEASE GO ON H3H3 !!
Dear Ryan, Can you make a short trailer on Chess the game
RYAN! This is a few days late but congrats on hitting 4 BILLION VIEWS!! Ah thats so incredible when you think about it :)
Why did they spend almost 5min dissing Oahu? I live there! I mean if I'm being honest it is kinda lame compared to the other Hawaiian Islands and has a way too large of a population. Okay, Oahu kinda sucks compared to the other islands.
That WHITE DUDE ian should have a channel on YouTube
@59:50 cracked me up
Why are there so many off pill podcast
Dear Ryan can you do the TEE HEE song

2 old youtube gods
Hit like if you want Ryan to invite Shane Dawson
Kevjumba pleasee
I love parkourse
Hasbro might come after my channel for playing one of their songs from beginning to end... I know they might not actually come after my channel again just for this... They went after my channel for playing a high quality good clip from the first episode of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic... Don't worry I took the video down because it resulted in my first strike on my channel... I only have one strike on my channel...
YO I WAS BORN IN 2005 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

32:23 mommy he said bad word call 9/11

Yeah it's hard to find truly pure blooded, native Hawaiians.. so noone has right to be harsh to anyone else since everyone has immigrant blood in them tbh. Then again racism is everywhere (when it shouldn't even exist) sadly..
hi :)
Dear Ryan do a every _ ever video
i was only surprised that it was a shotgun
1:12:01 shoutouts to Guam :D
I don't see any difference between Ryan off pill and Ryan on pill

Dear Ryan could you do a rap on sand
Ian is such a beta
You’re a bootleg nigahiga man you’ll never be as big-rice gum should’ve kept that in mind. I miss old rice gum man. I used to watch him when he was in the neighborhood with Ryan but as soon as he moved to LA I stopped following him. I missed the sketch comedy and the creativity not flexing and riding trends. Subbed since pre 10k but now I gotta unsub. Srry rice
What the fox say?
Fake, ian is not that serious.
Ian he cockd
Didn’t even kno he posted
GET👏KEV👏JUM👏BA👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Off the Smoshcast
GET KEV ON THE PODCAST PLEASSEEE
Ryan: Guys were dating haha!

Lamps: acting suprised
Ryan: We're dating!
Everyone: Same exact joke that everyone else made
pretends to be shocked but already knew it since agent of secret stuff
Finally said, I’ve been waiting for this since A.S.S
Dear, Ryan can you make your own version of infinity war
Ryan: “Me and Arden are together!”

Me: 😱 Pretends to be shocked!
Yes, it would have been nice to actually see the two of them interact and talk about their relationship in the video like anybody else with a girlfriend announcement, but when you've been subscribed to nigahiga this long you just learn to a accept that this is as serious of a video you're going to get, because it's nigahiga we're talking about here.
Ryan:Me and arden are a couple








Us: Suprised pikachu meme
You are probably the last OG you tuber left intact, and I’m proud of you. Smosh is a shell of its former self. RayWilliamJohnson imploded. Kevjumba disappeared and is now pursuing other stuff.
I was just waiting for Greg to be revealed😂😂
Gives arden only roles of a lover for the last 5 years*

Ryan: "i will now reveal my secret girlfriend"
So, it's not....Greg?😖😖
walks away disappointed; comes back from the closet with my 2000-and-something Arden & Ryan ship shirt

I knew it!
Y
Yo
You
You p
You pr
You pro
You probably thought Im gonna waste my time on this
the low budget editing made my day! 🤣
Yeah we’ve BEEN shipping them and they’ve BEEN dating wtf lol
This is such a genuinely funny video like I’m crying
Who the hell is Arden Chay?  🤣
I mean, it's dEfiNItEly not like we already knew hahahaha

(Jk,  congratulations Ryan)
"but i still remember our anniversary, its in the 26"
wife: *claps*"You missee by only 3 days this year, you are getting better"
They be dating since 2008 with the A.S.S. movie release though.
I like how fast he gets to the point.
But I thought nice guys finish last...
Rhpc: ryan you’re so predictable 

Ryan: me and arden are dating

Ppl in the comments: ryan you’re so predictable
I don't keep up with Ryan's vidoes on a regular basis, but I've been watching him on and off since 2009, and I have to say, some things never change. And It makes me happy to see that.
Roses are red 
Violets are blue 
The part your looking for is 5:52
Its common to have trust issues from this channel
Who the hell is Arden Chay?
Am I the only one that low key didn’t have a clue about them dating ? Just me ? Okay.
I knew it was a serious thing (kinda, its Ryan, it's not a Ryan video if it doesn't joke around even if just a little bit) but I was hoping it was Sean in a wig. But Greg is win too!!
The low budget editing was because it was Greg under the blanket. 
Till this day he is still there
"I'm dating Arden Cho"
Everyone: pikachu meme
Arden and Ryan: WE ARE DATING!!!   everyone starts to act surprised OMG   love your vids
But I thought she was dating Scott Mcall
Ok, can I request that song to be on Spotify?
I'm so happy for you Ryan and Arden! Please last long and always be happy. Brb gonna cry now tears of joy...
Greg standing up and clapping for himself has got to be my favorite Greg moment
Dear Ryan,
Can you make a new song with BgA?
6:49 that's a girl. Look at the shoulders they don't fit they're loose. Then look just before face reveal.
Dear Ryan, can you make an "If Harry Potter took place today" video?
This video is so different without Sean.
Guess it'll be another 3-5 years until we find out they're married
That's cool and all but...
When is A.S.S. 2 coming out?
WHY ARE ALL COMMENTS SAYING THAT THEY KNEW LIKE BISH I DIDN'T I AM S H O O K insert Pikachu shocked meme This is like the best couple 2019 omfg
If we look past the fact the song is meant for comedic purposes, it was quite beautiful.
So like are you dating? The reveal was kind of confusing, but hey, you two make an amazing couple! 😘
We all have trust issues with this channel lol😂
Wow, I can't believe BGA have their first dating scandal 😱🤣🤣🤣
Then ending was spectacular
This is the most surprising not surprising thing I've ever seen!
Let’s be honest Ryan can’t make a video without being funny








Or can he?
It's common to have trust issues from this channel
Ah good! Now I wont have to feel bad about shipping them 😂 CONGRATS ❤
the askew collar really bothered me during the entire video.  
heh.
i had to use subtitles to focus...



congratulations on not being single~
BRUH YOU GUYS KISSED IN THAT VIDEO I JIST KNEW IT
Ok so, all of us here in the comments are just gonna pretend to be suprised? Aight

I CALLED IT 9 YEARS AGO WHEN HE KEPT SAYING THEY HAD TO REDO THE KISS SCENE
The ending thoooo
WHO THE HELL IS ARDEN CHAY
Woah really? You two were dating?
That is so surprising!
4:30 how Arden jumped and landed safely...tf 🤣🤣🤣
Do ANOTHER COOKING BUT NOT REALLY. CREPE CAKE
I thought his GF was Greg
Oh it was Greg
Ryan: It's Arden!
Me: pretends to be surprised
Ryan it looks like you wearing a wedding band around your neck 😏 Are you'll secretly married 😨
YES I SHIPPED THEM SINCE DAY 1 FINALLY
sean: am i a joke to you?
So many gf in past vids were they ur actual gf
I’ve known he’s been dating someone for years. He came into my store and bought bath bombs for her 😭😂

Hey Ryan! Love from Pakistan...

RYARDEN HAS SAILED IT SAILED WE FINALLY KNOW 




Ryan: Arden and I are dating

Everyone else: 

Come on ryan
My birthday was on March 23
have u been working out bro?
Ryan Higa reveals Arden Cho as girlfriend, surprises no one
I've always shipped them ever since I watched A.S.S ... Im so happyyy❤❤❤
Its a not-so secret tho

But FINALLY MY OTP!!! ♡♡♡
I hope you guys wont having any bad comments because many of us love you guys!

I really happy to you guys, I wish you'll reveal your engaged or married soon 😁
Such a cute girlfriend 💝 Ryan hit the jackpot
So wait are they together? Im confused
pretends to be shocked





Edit: wtf . Thanks guys.. 5k likes was never expected
I legit thought he said “fat wine”
Guess you could say Arden is an S.W.G
😂😂😂 I love you guys! Thanks for the official reveal!
Oh YES! Ever since A.S.S. I’ve been shipping them 🤣🙌🏾🥰
I knew he'd be this extra about revealing
I WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN FROM SUCH A LONG TIME LETS SEE.... 5 years
Is Pucko Asian or Hispanic
Lost your god status and it was revoked... 🤭

X.x
That chorus on 5:13 was amazing!
The lyrics were bad for a relationship...   ...but still!
After AGENTS OF SECRET STUFF skit i BEEN KNEW yall were a thing
When he took off the mask and it was Greg, and then bald Greg started clapping 😂. I was laughing for a good two minutes straight, I could barely breathe rn 😂🤣
6:10 be everybody waiting for who ryan is dating... and you see paper... 🤦🏻‍♀️
I was honestly expecting Greg again and looks like I was right
Ryan : has a gf
Me : insert unsurprised Pikachu
AWWW THEY ARE SO PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER!
Not once did I think it wouldn't be possible. Over a year I've grown to see Ryan as a person, and when he did that Valentine joke video, and pretend Greg was his crush as a joke, personally, I rather him have a life of his own not needing to be shared.
I rather you be able to have something for yourself without needing us to know everything about it...

Whether or not I'm being rated as on a scale towards being a Lamp (Fan), I think it's what a real Lamp (Fan) would be like to that person.

Have something special for yourself buddy.
Haha that ending was gold 😂 love you man. Still funny after so many years.
but the real question is




who the hell is arden chay?
Despite already kinda knowing I clicked on this way too fast
Congrats Ryan and Arden. Last long. 😍😍
Haven’t been on this channel in years and it’s still doing amazing 😳 his mind
The song, out of context, is weird AF
I knew i shouldnt trust this motherfcker 😂😂😂
We all knew that ur girlfriend was Arden like 5years ago
Has Ryan been working out?
i must be the most oblivious person on earth to figure out after all these years of watching yall that you guys are dating lol....good thing i still shipped it
I mean like wow I am fooled every time that I don't even know which to believe now.
But congrats...? (crying smiling)
We've been paid right? -paco 😂😂😂
A.S.S is still my favorite Nigahiga Video
4 years later still 21m subs
1:09 you can see the conviction in his eyes...
this video was really good nice job ryank
WongFu always made videos about romances that were never real, but they actually created a real one without knowing it. And it was all thanks to ASS.
this video is proof we can't trust actors
I love Arden! My fav role she played was Kira Yukimura from Teen Wolf
Arden Cho is amazing🔥💪
The end. "Who is Arden Chay?!"
Brilliant!!😂😂😂
Ryan: I am dating Arden.
Me: Actually suprised.
Shes soooo CUTE (you see after the teehee)
Dang!! I thought it was a clickbait.
I've been looking for a sign that 2019 is gonna be a better year than 2018. This is it.
Been pronouncing Arden's full name wrong the whole time then. Arden Chay 😔
Been shipping these two since the Agent of Secret Stuff skit!!!!! Gosh good ol days
damn, only took you 7 years to get the girl
I love the ending!😁
Ryan: So no theatricals...
Me: Be ready to see some theatricals...
well technically dating arden was a mirror-coal...
I don't know how to spell her name but she was in the "ways to breakup with someone video"

You both were great together!!!
Even if you weren't 

Good for you man!!!
Sorry ladies he's officially off the market, went ahead and got himself a big strong man.
I have one thing to say:
We know already
*wait that's two words dammit
The Guitar n that red blanket reminds me to the kdrama ‘memories of alhambra’😢
HOLE-Y

ba dum ching

get it?
teen wolf i watched all the seasons fav show!she be a fox and going out with scott
Ryan: constantly shows her as his girlfriend in videos this should be straight forward 

Also Ryan: no, they will be COMPLETELY SURPRISED SO MAKE AN ENTIRE ANNOUNCEMENT VIDEO
The ending though 😂😂😂
I didn't even have to follow Ryan on other social media platforms to know it was Arden. Huh. Well, um, here's to Ryan and Arden having a fantastic relationship! :3
Teen wolf fam ??? Only me..ok
Yup knew it all along but face the truth you made 50% of the video a skit Ryan😅
People have been shipping you two ever since A.S.S, now it's finally official.
Me a week ago
Sees this 
Me: I bet it’s Arden 
Ryan: I am dating Arden!
Me: No shittaki mushrooms
So Demetrius Johnson became a YouTuber... Interesting.

"A real secret agent always gets the girl in the end."

The problem is that I'm so used Ryan trolling us that I'm still confused whether this is a joke.
Omg!!!! I was so happy and touched when he said I'm daiting Arden... I always wanted you guys to date like everyone else did! Sooo happy for you two! 😭😭😭💕 Also the video was funny as always xD!!!
Never stop doing this dad.....keep making us laugh.....and hope you find( or have found)  The One for ya...😘 Best Of Luck 😉

*Pretends to be shocked*
YASSSSS I remember commenting about how I ship you two after your truth or dare video and wow it’s actually true
Top ten anime plot twists of all time
Hey Ryan :can you please do a video where Youtube is a theatre ,and  channels are just different rooms in the theatre and in order to comment you have to stand in front of the theatre with a mic  before you can comment.  thank you.
Arden~<3 I liked her since "Agents of Secret Stuff" :DD
If they broke up now we wouldn’t know until 2021

OG Ryan Higa fans have been waiting for this since Agents Of Secret Stuff
They are such an attractive couple.
I knew it! Ever since I saw you two in the movie I knew you would get together eventually! (Ship Officially Sailed!)
"nice guys finish last" remember?
Yeah... I called it long before Ryan and Arden too.😎
I KNEW IT! So how long has this been a thing? 2...3..4...or 5 years?
Ryan: i am dating Arden


Everyone :*laughs* this is some funny skit!
i’ve been shipping Ryan & Arden since ASS
UGHH YES!! Yet another ship that became canon!!
i shipped Ryan and Arden since "Agents of Secret Stuff" like yaaaas
Nawww so sweet though I wish the real arden was in the video but the dude in the beard was funny
No one : 
Ryan : I'm dating Arden
LOL this is hilarious. Also after years of people shipping these guys, finally they "reveal the truth"! Now hopefully everyone will let them live their lives. In peace!

Really curious what Arden's reaction was when you showed her this video.
John mayer's new light vibes anyone? 😂
Greg has impressive editing skills. To go from the amazing visual effects in Exposed to purposely bad editing here. I am consistently impressed by Greg.
when he took off the mask 💯💯💯 🤣🤣🤣
Dear ryan can you make real struggles of life and real fear videos
Wait... then this makes it pretty awkward for all the relationship vids he made without Arden...
LMAO when rip mask off and dude that edit on the music video BRILLANT
Dear Ryan Can you prove that  Arden Chay is Arden Cho

Arden's lucky to have you... and your quirky personality 😂🤘🏼
Expecting the marriage proposal to be epic.

Okay so I was watching a lot of his old videos and he sounds so mature now omg LOL
Dear ryan can you make a video about Europe Final Countdown Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!

When the person was under the towel I was like PLEASE BE GREG INA WIG😂
This video came out a month early
26 of March is my birthday
Daaamn ASS , I remember this movie😂You guys cute.
Let's see, how long have we been waiting for this? Like maybe NINE years lol. Ryan Higa is the best youtuber, original and funny!
I'm so happy that finally they reveal their relationship!!! eventhough i already know for years that they're dating
ryan and arden: we're dating!! 
everyone: pretends to be surprised
The Heck !? It’s Lenten. You shouldn’t say alleluia or hallelujah
Childhood memories coming back! Thanks Ryan for making a great video!
Who here wants R.H.P.C to do another Parkourse!!!

oh ye, so surprised, so so so surprised, BUT AWWWW U GUYSSSS AWWWWWWW SO HAPPIIII
Arden in the ending was so good 😂😂😂😂😂😂 love you Ryan
I'm done with this troll RYAN!
It should have been Sean. Bros before Chos.
I thought you were married!
Only the OG YouTubers like him know how to make a video this funny and extra
The great reveal! 💗
Well.. This took MUCH longer than expected.
"I don't wanna to make a big deal about it"

proceeds to make a big deal about it
Here for Arden and Teen Wolf! Ryan is very lucky. Deserves every good thing that happens to him!
honestly my favourite part was at the end with Arden freaking out about Arden
OMG BRUH IM CRYING TEARS OF JOY :,)
Trying to figure out who disliked this🤣
Does anyone else miss Sean?
Wow, Im hoping for this. It was Arden😍
Though you are one of the best youtuber out there but imo your edits are way too fast/early, idk what to exactly say about it.
your jawline looks good in this vid
3dayslater
surpstea 
🍵 is delicious
The RyDen ship has sailed now...👍👍👍
The ending🤣🤣
LMAO Greg clapping at the end killed me
Agent of Secret Stuff part 2!!!
watched ryan's videos since 10 years ago how does he look better over time omg
My Ryan Higa Wishlist:

1. RyDen Confirmation ✔
2. BgA Comeback
3. New Episodes of Will & Greg Show

Alright bois, two more to go.
Congrats omg , let me send you some unicorn luv ❤️
I know it, my ship <3
When i first heard the rumors a couple years ago i kinda stalked her and secretly hated her a bit haha but i think it was just the secretness of it all that bugged me even tho i got why they were doing it and that it wasnt like they owed an explanation to anyone but still.

Still, for ryan to do this...HIM of all people?!?! This was HUGEEEE! And im now totally okay and shipping them so hard haha. I just want to see him happy and knowing hes been happy for the past 5 years or so but hearing it from HIM (which is all i needed haha) made this "reveal" so much better ❤❤❤

Also, can i just say im so GLAD daina got more screentime in this vid? ABOUT DAMN TIME!!!! That girl is the glue of the team, these guys would be so clueless without her, most underappreciated rhpc member for sureee! WE WANT MORE DAINAAA
How to get girlfriend did work😂😂
Your face on the thumbnail tho



Who else liked it?
I haven't watched one of your video's in a long time.
That's what I say a good fuc*in PLOT TWIST!
Only ogs will remember when he was number one subscriber rank
Ryan: writes a whole song for Arden, telling her how much of a mess he is and appreciates that she still likes him
Arden: WHO IS ARDEN CHAYYY???
You came up with nice and hilarious songs but they all turned up good songs...my favorite YouTuber of all time
"Who da hell iz Arden Chang? " 😹😹😹😹
Arden is gorgeous and I would be jealous but of all people Ryan Higa is the one I would deem worthy so kudos 😂
What's the song's name? Is just beautiful, you should release it :D
After years of shipping, Ryden conquers.
I'm not surprised but either way, I'm so happy for you guys!
Dye your hair...
With dark purple
your nickname better be higa
I love your vids! This video deserves more view and likes, I mean like I expected with something as eventful as you revealing your girlfriend, I thought more people would watch. I've been watching your vids for so long and love your actually good content. Thanks for uploading so often! Love your content and keep it up!
Ryan likes to defy expectations, so I was expecting that under the Arden mask would be the actual Arden. Anyone else?
THE most original and creative YouTubed out there
I was legit crying about life before this, but then I watched this and it helped😪

I haven't watch NigaHiga for quite some time now (years I think)

What happened to his voice? It wasn't this deep before.

Because of this. He sounds more serious now 😔
Ryan the most romantic boyfriend ever
"wHo thE hElL is ArDen Chay?" OML I DIED
Dear Ryan, why is Paco always Hugging pillows?
What happened to Ryan & Catherine Dekoekkoek?
The whole Tv screen thing compilation of like Arden as Kira on TW and like Ryan and stuff killed me😂😂😂 so this is what Kira did after she left Beacon Hills
This ENTIRE thing is legendary
Ryan : I am dating Arden
Everyone : oH rEaLLy oH mY gAwD wE nEveR kNeW oH wE nEvEr sUspEcTeD a ThiNg *over dramatic gasps*

.

btw: we all know that long ago, how long you think we watch this channel
This is my first time watching yout video. And I’m inlove 😍😍 Ur so handsome 😍😍
Greg looks like the next James harden
Arden chey is a keeper , bro !!!! 😂😂😂
Did Ryan finally get his hands on an SWG?
Please give your vlog cam to pewds.... 
HE NEEDS IT
God loves you.
He sent his son so through him we can have eternal life.
Humbly seek him.
I knew it was going click bait video 🤣
Someone literally updated Arden Cho's wikipedia page just not long ago xDDD
Nani....
That is a miracle
holy shit isnt that the girl who played kira in teen wolf
Sees thumbnail. 
Hahahahaha. This must be a joke.
Who saw that picture Will and Greg made 0:35
Plot twist : Ryan is dating Arden 




But Marries SEAN
Welp RIP Ryan
she will forever be known as Arden Chay
No one can even take it seriously cuz of all his jokes in all his vids🤣🤣🤣
I THOUGHT YOU QUIT YOUTUBE SJJSJBDJWJDIWJDJZJDBRKCISH
This man actually used 2008 Word’s stylish Text for the skit.

What a G
NANI???
i knew from the begging it was her
I put off watching this for 3 days because I wasn’t ready for it not to be Arden but I’m okay now. Everything is A-okay.
5:40 is that in St.John’s Newfoundland lol (not the drummers)
Arden and Ryan are so cute😍
I was actually surprised and then, confused 😐
me here from the ranking, where i saw your channel which used to be the top most subscribed channel back in the days.
Oooh we have the same necklace :3
sorry am the only one who thought it was common knowledge that hes been dating arden cho for time???😂😭
Dear Ryan Can you prove that you are Ryan
This is the content I subscribed for!
Now i feel 500% lonelier.
wow its been years since I've watched you only for youtube to notify me you finally have a girlfriend lol
plot twist-ryan's real gf in paco.
Remember when Ryan was the most subscribed to YouTube channel.
7:08 you forgot 2 minutes and 52 seconds 


I’m half Asian that’s why I’m good at math 



Lol
I love how his first public gf is his next public gf! I remember those days!!!! Awesome!
I think we all want to know how long it took to put this video together 😂 so many edits for that music video
So good to have you back bro higa
I skipped to the ending of the video just to confirm its  sean
I literally have the same cowboy hat as Ryan
that is why I feel different about her since the beginning.
My dreams since A.S.S have come true
Lol.. after all that song and coming out and still girls be like -" who the hells arden chay (ﾉ｀□´)ﾉ⌒┻━┻"
Did anyone else get a little disappointed when he revealed it and Arden wasn’t there? 😂 kinda expected it tho but still
Werewolves and Vampires are not suppose to be together....
Remember the good old days when you were most subscribed in 2011
my gheedd WORD ART. 😂😂😂
i’ve been waiting for this ever since agents of secret stuff ...
I thought they were dating since the “Every Romantic Movie” video
My mind has bee blown didn’t know you were dating Arden cho wtf I love teen wolf
I love the environment here. Like people ship you with her but that's about it. No one was dying to know and hound you forever and be rude and intrusive about it.
Did anyone else get recommended the "a,s,s video" after this came out?
and the literal prettiest girlfriend possible. wowwww
i loooooove arden chooooooo yayyayayyayayay
1 second in: Yep Ryan’s doing that ‘I can’t deal with being serious’ thing again 😂😅
this video is more like a comfirmation that you guys were dating rather than an announcment💀💀 but it did make me laugh
BITHC I SHOUKDVE KNOWN
What video of Ryan’s is not a skit joke thing.!
XD Loved that nding
Who else has memorized this entire song 😳
Ryan Higa forever😁
Also can u guys make another episode of "ryan makes" just like the fort of snow
THE PAINTING THOUGH
😂
HE FOUND HIS GUITAR.
Those title cards im sure that was from Ms Word
Istg ryan you make me laugh all the god damn time HAHAHAH
Omg I remember from A.S.S her voice was so high piched. But this video at the end her voice is more deep lol.
I've always known! This ain't a surprise, but it's so cute
Watching Ryan higa while working at McDonalds
After seeing Brandon Rogers nigahiga looks so decent
Congrats Ryan
Now we gotta wait 3-5 years to find out if youre married
This kind of feels like a joke, but everyone knows that he’s dating Arden
I shipped them from the moment I first saw them
We already knew !!!!!! Hahahah
It was rally obvious for a while. But I have a question, when did they start dating?
I've never been this disappointed in my life. I'm unsubscribing.
I never thought you would be low enough to ever cheat on Sean!
Good mars first joke. I got so pranked
I CALLED IT SINCE AGENTS OF SECRET STUFF
The ending 😂🤣🤣
Tbh i could not care who he was dating but i am glad that his with someone and that his happy because ryan is type of guy who is alway very positive about his vid and is good at making them.      A happy ryan higa is a hilarious and creative ryan higa 👍
I think Ryan deciding to not care about what people think and post what HE wants to post was the best decision he has ever made
Everyone stole my comment ideas. Guess I cant meme.
Pikachu meme
I think this video been copystriked AGAIN by YouTube
I hate anyone copy striking Ryan
“Not to be mean but who would be able to date Ryan as dramatic as he is” 2:34

“Arden Cho. Makes sense; if anyone could it’s her.”
I think im the only one who dident know Ryan was dating Arden
WHAT WAS GREG SAYING SOMEONE TELL ME I DIDN'T CATCH THAAAT 1:10
IT WOULD BE FUNNIER IF SEAN WAS THERE
As if we didn't know <3
Can you bring back skitzo
FINALLY now I can die with satisfaction
R they actually dating?!!! For real?!
Ryan's proposal is gonna be lit
Omg this so cute, and i m laughinh my ass out🤣🤣🤣🤣
I FRIGGIN KNEW IT!
loveeeddd😭😭😭🔥🔥
SO IT IS ARDIN CHO? I FORGOT THE NAME
I laugh without fail every video! Thanks for keeping it great!
Low key you should make an original country song
And I thought that it would be Regina-
He's hiding under aged girl 🤣
When Ryan’s trolled you every single time you think he’s being serious so you lowkey expected this but still highkey shook.
Greg looks like the main character on cooking with babish .
Dear ryan cam you make a superhero episode with the RSHPC?
We knew it from the beginning =)
TRENDING!!! Finally!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
The ending was the best 😂
Dear Ryan, can u please put Arden in a video for us to see and just talk about random things
Wait... what is this video you’re posting?! 😳
Who scrolled through the comment section just to find a hero that announced the timeline of Ryan’s confession? 36:17. You’re welcome
Been shipping them since Agents of Secret Stuff
he just casually dropped news about BgA lmao anyways yeah armys are wild but isn't that what everyone brands every big fandom, like ppl still don't get the memo
Can't wait for that new BGA video tho
He's dating who we all knew he was:






Paco.

I’m sorry but Ryan I’m missing skitzo .

Do what you want but skitzo coming soon ?
Sad how low the views have gotten since Ryan started doing podcasts. :'c
People don't get how calming and amazing these podcasts are. It's better for a YouTuber to talk about whatever and be themselves for a change.
Ryan: "I'm dating Arden."


Lamps: pretends to be shocked 

But sryly tho, I love them both & wish them all the best 💕
36:13 THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR HONESTLY
Okay guys it's time for a JAY PARK reunion pleeeeeease have him on the podcast???

Personal opinion: I love Chris Pratt okay? He’s funny and a pretty nice dude and I may not necessarily agree with some of his views(have these even been proven btw??) I still truly believe he’s a pretty good guy
Whenever the shot is on ryan, you can see in the top left corner these two moving doll thingies thwt distracted me for at least a minute...
Ryan’s girlfriend is a lamp
that’s his one true love
38:07


paco: did you k i s s
ryan: whAt???nothatsdisgustingthatssickyouresick.sick
paco:
paco:  ?
Paco really shines in this podcasts. 
Also, not surprised with the Ryan and Arden relationship, but my question is, when did it start?
Arden should come on the podcast
Yo BGA!!! 08:00 mark I'm so happyyy! 🤯 and I'm happy for you and Arden 😆
Ryan you are allowed to put ads inbetween this one hour video!! We wont judge. Get that moneeeee
Use this as a "I KNEW IT!" button.

I see Ryan's girlfriend I click. Better not be click baiting boi
8:06 BGA is having a comeback omygods yes absolutely please. The kpoopers are excited.
4:50 "Burning 똥구멍 Syndrome" is definitely not a Korean Korean thing Lmaoooo
We still would've used the word Syndrome(since we use it as "syndrome" in Korean too) but not the "burning" part bc it's completely in English not Korean
Please do a podcast with all the members of BgA after your comeback. (including a Q&A)
Lol yo the part where you guys talk about BTS fans (ARMY), the "agressiveness" isn't just ARMY though, I think its in every fandom. Every fandom has the hardcore "agressive" ones whether its in kpop or western music. But honestly, as an ARMY, most of us are cool and chill, we just have some that give us a bad rep but again, every fandom has it.

Also, Ryan talk about sports on the podcast if you want to 😂
BLACKPINK
TWICE
and Red Velvet
the top girlgroup on korea right now even famous internationally
I love your podcasts! They’re just enjoyable, chill, and real. Y’all keep doing you!
Podcasts on relationships!! And bring Arden on :)
Love ur podcasts! Keep up the good work 👍
Who here form top 10 Most popular

I love how honest Ryan is on his podcast
Yes! Please bring BgA out of the dungeon. We need the comeback! 💜🤙🏻
BGA COMEBACK!!!!!!
Ryan: whispers exclusivesss....
Me: whispers JYP....
An idea for next OTP:
Talk about coming out as LGBTQ with Lilly Singh, as she just came out as Bi.💕
Thanks for the confirmation we knew already but I'm happy you feel comfortable to share it ❤
OoF the video isn't out Ryan... WE GOT EXCLUSIVES!!!!
That moment when you realize Ryan Higa knows The Lonely Island.......

PLEASE DO A COLLAB PLEAAAASSEEEEE
All of this was just for you my Mystery Girlfriend in Real Life that I guess I'm finally going to reveal and go public about 😂

MY SHIP HAS SAILED!!! without me knowing BUT I'M SO GLAD! MAY YOU TWO BE SO SUPER BLESSED TOGETHER :>
This podcast needs youtube midrolls during the shi shi break. As long as these podcasts don’t get demonetized then go for it. I’m already investing an hour to listen to you. I don’t mind an extra 15sec if it helps you guys out 👍🏾
paco is such a good moderator. he directs the conversations really well and I really like how he keeps everyone on focus.
If u guys made a sports podcast, u should call it benchwarmers! 😂
Life's so beautiful after this announcement. I can die at peace now
At least someone got their happy ending...Anyways I'm happy for you ryan!
I SHIPPED YOU TWO SINCE THE BEGINNING!!!




Love your content Ryan! Keep it up!
WAIT WAIT WAIT HE'S ACTUALLY DATING ARDEN I'VE BEEN SHIPPING THIS SINCE FOREVER 😭
y'all are so lovable. any one of you as a friend would be such a blessing.
These podcasts are my favorite content on YouTube and I hope to see and hear more of them!
"I'm dating Arden"
Me: This is brand new information!
Congrats Ryan! I knew u both meant together since ASS 2010
Hey ryan
I just wanted to say that i love your mind and I can feel when its a video you want to make and I love Your videoes xD
And this podcast is so amazing
Love you, Paco and Will!!
TEEHEE
do an "Off the Pill Podcast" with Arden
8:00 BgA comeback (ur welcome)
most underrated youtube series ever: off the pill podcast 💊♥️
i LOVE paco he always makes me laugh🤣🤣🤣
Did you kissssssss

(ps. Anyone want to be YouTube friends? I make skits lol)
YOU AND ARDEN ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER omg I'm actually dying
Part 5/6(so far)
Finally gets an intro
for the 33:50 story as an indonesian myself, i can confirm that. in indonesia they believe that massaging should remove air from the body. They are stimulating the clients to burp, some people burp some people don't. I never burp when i got massages while my father burps ALOT. The more you know.


P.S. Not all massages do this, just tradisional java and sundaneese massages. Normal massages are still normal.
THIS IS THE DAY I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!
Haha how could we POSSIBLY have known? 😜 jokes aside, happy to have Ryan say it himself so you both can be more open about it 

Look at Ryan being all shy lool
Ryan’s gf...






It’s either Greg or Paco. I’m calling it
Ohhh helllll noooo
I'm sooo jealous and happy at the same time 
I'll always love you Ryan 
RYDEN ship is Riding 😁💕
Hey Ryan, please continue your podcasts! you're making my studying more enjoyable :3
Love these podcasts!!! You guys always make me laugh but then have some really thought provoking and deep conversations
I do want BGA back, big bro Ryan 😂, and congrats getting a gf
THEY'RE SOOOOOOO CUTEEE....Ryan and Arden...  Also, lemme just say, whoever wrote that title knows how to grab the attention of viewers. My heart couldn't handle the mention of BTS, his gf and his first kiss in a single line.
I said it once and I’ll say it again: I absolutely L O V E these podcasts.. keep ‘em coming!:)
But what video did he release of him & Arden? 🤷🏻‍♀️
You should post the clips from the podcast on the main channel, not higatv
51:50 why arn't more people talking about this LOOL
Paco shipping arden and ryan so hard is MOOD
Ryan should try to get on Joe Rogan's podcast lol Also, I always suspected that Arden and Ryan would be together and I think it's really nice.  They have really good chemistry.
OOOOOHHHHHHHHH. YYYEEEESSSS MORE BGA

MY LOVE SHA'N'T DIE. 💔
Totally using the code to buy my BTS tickets!!!!!
Cant listen your podcast on Spotify in the Netherlands 😭😭
RYDEN.
i finally found my otp.
higaTVs BTS —> BTS

then BTS=firey poops —> kpoopers

coincidence? I THINK NOT
I was low key wanting an announcement that Lilly and Ryan were dating...
If both Arden and Ryan are truly happy, then I'm also happy for Ryan...  :')
I saw “ryan’s gf” so i click
Coming from me, who’s been an army since 2016, I can’t argue with what you guys said about the fandom. Some Armys do get too aggressive, which causes drama (this happens a lot on Twitter) and fan wars, especially with other K-Pop groups. Anyway, I really CANNOT WAIT FOR THE BGA COMEBACK ITS BEEN LIKE 1739162 YEARS SKSKSSKSKSKSKKSKS—
Also, I’m really happy for you and Arden. I mean, since Agents of Secret Stuff, a lot of people started shipping you two together (including me) 💜💜💜
Who's Next? Answer: Arden Chay😁
lmao I thought you were dating Arden Chay :)
I was kinda confused when you talked about apex but the i realize it was a game and NOT the school reading program😂
“I’m dating Arden” 

WE KNOW!! UHAHHSJXJDBBnsksjffsah

Like I’m so happy but also stressed because like I’ve always thought they were dating since A.S.S but to finally have them confirm lifts a big weight off my shoulders 

It’s so cute it’s kinda disgusting 😂😭😭
Me on Instagram:YOU GUYS REALLY JUST NEED TO ADMIT YOU'RE DATING ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS 😭

me on youtube: OMG WHAAAAAAT YAAAAAYAHAJSBSKSHSIEHE😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕
AHHHH!!! I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU, RYAN!
BUT DON'T RUN OUT OF SALT AND USE YOUR DANDRUFF OK
Ryan Higa in: "Swirling Spit: the First Edition."
For my first kiss I was so prepared lol. I looked up how to kiss and everything.( haha) So when I went to kiss him, I wanted to be in control. Cause I imagined how I would do it in my mind. But it was so awkward and slow.

Cause I was hesitating too much. Anyways I was super annoyed at him because when I first did it he was laughing. He let me do what I wanted, and then half way through he took control and showed me what to do. Lol. 😂 so embarrassing!!!
36:14 Ryan says he's dating ARDEN CHO
I would personally LOVE for you to talk about mma. Joe Rogan 2.0???
that hipster part made me rethink my whole life and the way i think about EVERYTHING
"thats prolly the name of one of their songs. fire shiz" close Ryan, its just "Fire"
music is universal so we don't always need translations to appreciate the music c: and also there are like super toxic armys but most of us are really nice :^) (hopefully) oh and multifandomed 😌😌💜
I'm pretty sure everyone knew they were dating XD
Okay but im lovin the new mini intro tho
Do you think they've been dating since agents of secret stuff?
SHOUTOUT TO BLACKPINK XD
Can you please bring KevJumba to the show!!
OH MY GOD, I'M TOTALLY HYPERVENTILATING.

I'm so happy for them! They deserve the most special love story there is.
Paco: "Did you guys kiiiiiisssssss" Ryan: "Ew"
All I could think kf was SWG......
I want to see a “on the pill” podcast
The slow format for PUBG: Walk around for 10-15 mins, use up to 15% of your ammo on people you don't kill, die to a headshot from a guy who detected your half-a-pixel from across the map
OG lamps already knew about Ryan & Arden but its really good to hear Ryan say it.
PLEASE PUT THESE ON APPLE PODCASTS
Congratulations ♥️♥️😂 finally you're dating!
the moving figures behind Ryan be distracting me. I cant help but to stare at it ;-;
And with this, the Ryden ship has sunken all other ships 😂😂😂
36:19 pretends to be shocked

 still internally screaming because of too much kilig ❤️😍😍😍
dude im gonna use this for my bts ticket thx
YES  MORE RAPTORS TALK.... lol. Also Jeremy Lin already my favorite Raptor of all time
Lamp Armys going to the stadium concerts, now you can save $20 on the tickets 😎
I came in, thought it was a click bait, realize Ryan Higa doesn't do click bait, got EXCITED YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Paco you should start a gaming cannle
have always known HAHAH but congratulations!! I've always rooted for u and arden  💛
Drinkinggame idea for Off the Pill Podcast: drink a shot everytime Ryan says "anyway"
But hey Im way more excited bcoz RyDen is officially reaaal
He says who his girlfriend is at 36:11
When they said seat geek I immediately thought this was David Dobriks views podcast
Who came here just for BTS😂🤣😄
is paco's real name paco or does his name start with a "p" and he used to work at taco bell so they started calling him paco
PLEASEEEEE DO SKITZO AGAIN!! 😃😃love your vids
ryan’s gf?! never clicked on a video so fast
0: BgA comeback confirmed!
You should do a sports podcast Ryan!
"what's blackpink?" BRUH
It was obvious but it's still nice to get a confirmation!  Thanks :P
Y’all are looking for 36:15
You’re welcome
"Paco, what's wrong with you?¿"
Hey Ryan, I'd like to hear what you have to say on MMA! Really looking forward to UFC 235, got a crazy main card on there
I just realized how long this podcast was and paused it cause I know I wouldn’t get any homework done if I continued watching ❤️😭
REAL FAN OF RYAN AND ARDEN KNEW IT ALL ALONG! RYDEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNN 💕💕💕 i’m so glad finally we get an official confirmation! Thanks for never do any clickbait lol
We all know who Ryan’s gf is. PAAACCCOOOO
Dear Ryan, can you do “Naruto Mirror Run Challenge” please?
I clicked SO fast when I saw BTS
Basketball and UFC (& Boxing) are like my two fave sports, so knowing the same applies to Ryan makes me an even bigger fan. 😂
Now... to celebrate.. imma watch Agents of Secret stuffs 😍😍😍😍
@23:04 the term you're looking for is "non-conformist"...
Uhh how does Ryan not know about Black Pink tf 😂👀
Watching other videos with Arden in them, you can now tell that they were dating. Like in the "Overdramatic People" video, Arden's contact name was, "💞Bae💞" and on Instagram, Arden came with Ryan to Hawaii. It all adds up.
Do a basketball podcast !!!!!
these podcasts are genuinely making me like Paco more and more after every episode with him (and i watched the very first ones too from the other channel). he's a really great conversationalist, he comes up with great questions, he transitions from topic to topic very smoothly and organically, his commentary is always amusing and well articulated; this format just fits him so well bc you can really tell how actually smart and charismatic he is. plus i think he's quite a peculiar and fascinating person (read: a zany ass weirdo xD) and has an interesting way of thinking about things. during the whole 'hipster' conversation i was actually quite impressed how non-defensive he was and how he's pretty self-aware in reality.
Ryan and Will are okay too i guess. ;D
seriously though, this podcast must be one of my favorite things you guys have come out with. you're all incredibly entertaining as well as insightful, so listening to you discuss anything is always really enthralling. :D
I LOVE IT, keep up the awesome work :)) <3
Hey man I like all your videos they r soo creative u r my best youtuber just don't listen to all the negative comments about your videos. Your videos r the best
Okay! Now im gonna go back to all Ryan & Arden videos 😂
Hay Ryan :) great podcast dude! Btw on your story of the burping women from Indonesia, that was their way to release the wind from massaging you guys 😆 so funny tho.. can't blame you 😆
HA! You think we dunno?? Congrats tho! We wish you the best!
39:05 paco is a true Ryden shipper 
Proud of you paco😂🤣
Bts?!!!! I’m here! 🙋‍♀️
i've followed you since day 1 and I feel like you're too grand for Youtube now
Blackpink 💕
Listen to it 😂😂
Go Spurs Go!!!!!! You should definitely do a a sports podcats!!

Lady Gaga has had a duet with R Kelly removed from streaming services

I just wanna know if it’s Arden or not....
666k views coincidence I think not
Talk about ufc 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪
Ohh yeahh, Ryan talking Spurs!
Yo Ryan we need kevjumba on this podcast!!!!
How long have they been dating? (This is a long podcast so I cant watch it)
Those moving dolls are so cute❤
Wills camera dying is my favorite part.
Ryan should play warframe... Hop on the looter shooter bandwagon
We did it boys. we got a sponsor.
I love how he was defending BTS, I am a part of the fandom and yes it can get a lil hardcore but look past it and see the boys for how they are
Loved pcness section. I've been in a runt for the past year over deciding to buy an artist's CD because I'm opposed to a decision he's made. I still love his art and listen to what I own already but I can't feel comfortable buying his last release even though I want to 😥😭
BGAAAAAAAA OMGGG FINALLY
Da a podcast with Arden cho😻
Your views might be going down but you'll eventually reach out to a newer audience who actually enjoys your podcasts. IMO ☺
We all know that one viewer that hasn't watched the first podcast and says "SELL OUT"
I LOVE THIS! WATCHED THE WHOLE THING!
Yooo a fighting and sports segment of the podcast would be dope!
literally love this podcast more than anything 😂
Paco’s the mvp for asking the obvious questions that fans want to know 🤣🤣
When I saw the title ... I CLICKED  💜😂 I’m so happy that you guys are dating 💜☀️ I’ve shipped you guys like forever 😂 I’m so happy 😂💜 Love and support you guys ! 💜
The truth is I found nigahiga first than bangtan but I love both of them 💜💜 borahae ARMYs
I loved A.S.S . That came out wrong
43:19 "can I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist" - AJR - role models
“Ryan’s gf revealed” WE BEEN KNEW FOR THE PAST LIKE YEAR
37:14 I kinda felt bad for Paco
we knew it all along but this confirmation just makes me so so happy
Hey you should make the podcast live like joe Rogan
Told my whole fam about seat geek cuz of this haha, all of us are gonna buy tickets
ahahahaha when bts literally has a song called "FIRE"
BEEN SHIPPING YOU BOTH 😊 OMG
podcast on relationship advice pls :)
I can't stop laughing about the burping ladies omg
I've been a subscriber since the dawn of YouTube and nigahiga (seriously...I think I saw How to be Ninja the month it was uploaded). I never comment but have got to speak up to say I've missed the Off the Pill rants and I enjoy these podcasts immensely. They cover so many topics I think about or want to hear other people's perspectives on.  Plus I can listen while doing something productive and responsible! Win-Win.
Ryan's girlfriend is G, duh. She's already been in so many videos.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the likes everyone.
OMGG YESSS 😍 I SHIP!!!
Predictable but still amazing to have the confirmation
Bangtan seoul or something 😂
Ryan we are all waiting for "Inside the minds of RHPC."
Today's fact: The longest recorded flight of a chicken is thirteen seconds.
Will's camera tho XD
Dear Ryan,  Can you react to Ricardo Milos
Arden and Ryan are so lucky to have each other ❤️❤️❤️
You was top 1 :)
Ryan's gf and bts army , all my favourite topics
The burping, if I'm not mistaken, that's when they do the massage, releasing some toxic/gas from your body. Your toxic got transferred to them, and released through them. Something like that. It's good for you, but not so much for them.
Dear Ryan 
Can you explain a robot without using any scientific words except the word robot
I love your podcasts! Keep up! On average, new podcasts fail in their first 5-10 episodes... You are half way there!
Is it normal that I thought they were dating when A.S.S came out😅👌🏻👍💕
The description says it's hosted by Ryan Higa... Paco is clearly hosting this podcast let's get real.
paco is so cute man... if you're ever in europe, HIT ME UP
I completely agree with what Paco said about armys as a fandom and he put it very accurately in only two words: hypocrite cult. that sums it up so nicely.
Also when they're saying RYan was working with David.. does that mean..... BGA????
The art (I wouldn't say it's a painting) behind paco lol. I just remembered. the time I watch how it was made, very clever.
Who came to see Ryan’s girlfriend?! I know I did
Will looks exactly like my volleyball coach
Dear Ryan, why is Paco always Hugging pillows?
How do you not know BlackPink 😂😂 ddu du ddu du was on trending for hella long
I NEED A BGA COMEBACK IM SO HYPED
Seatgeek is where I got my Wrestle mania 35 ticket from, absolutely love them!
would love to be friends with these guys. freakin hilarious
38:05 PACOO😂😂
Ok but where's the video where he reveals that Arden is his girlfriend
Never watched a podcast but then saw girlfriend in the title....i tapped so hard, my phone almost fell
Dear ryan 
Can you make an official fake trailer on Apex Legends
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
Dear Ryan, please do living ipod 2.0
since I'm in the fandom i understand lots of bts fans are some real sleeves grabbers, but actually they're just [quote podcast #1] Loud Minority. the boys are always promoting kindness and most of us are trying to implement it💘
I'd love to hear sports podcast from Ryan. Please do it !
just realised ryan higa is only 173. thought he was like 180
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES IVE BEEN WAITING EVER SINCE A.S.S






It’s finally true 😭
Aww how cute they’re dating! 💞
36:11 I KNEW HE WAS DATING ARDEN!!! late congrats lol
I wanna see how long Ryan can survive on The Official Podcast
First time on higas' podcast... damn he sounds so... entrepreneurial
Bts stands for BangTan Sonyeondan, that's where BTS comes from and it means Bulletproof Boyscots in English. You should seriously SERIOUSLY watch some BTS crack videos.
i thought so! i've been suspecting for a long time that you're dating arden because it's obvious
Paco is too funny! "Did you guys kissssssssssss?" 😂

Edit: Wow, so much likes! <3
while i'm not surprised that Arden is your GF (late congrats btw ❤❤❤), i want to clarify something about what you were talking in minute 33:05, about the burping lady. 

In here, Indonesia, when we get massage sometimes the one who get the treatment or the one who treat us will burp because we believe there's a condition we called "masuk angin" in your body. "Masuk Angin" (or Enter Wind in english, it's funny, i know) is a condition when we identify unwell feelings ranging from feeling queasy, fevers, and joint pain. So medically, masuk angin is a combination of symptoms described as a single illness.

and what's the connection with burping ?
There's a myth in Indonesia (real or not, who knows) that when you have "Masuk Angin" condition in your body, the Masseuse tend to burp to release the illness. The more you have it in your body, the masseuse will continuously burping too. it's like she/he transferred your illness to his/her body and release it by burping. it's not just the masseuse, sometime i also burping when i get the massage. There are some medical explain about this but i choose to believe the Myth anyway, lol

i'm so sorry that you heard the burp during the massage. i believe that it's inappropriate to burp in front of people but i can assure you that it wasn't a prank. 😁😁😁
i try to separate the personality from their work sometimes. no person can be so perfectly good.
so we all shipped them for years and ig a lot of people figured they were dating, but when ryan says a long time, how long? like how many years have they actually been together?
The podcasts are Really good when Paco is on them! He adds a different kind of value than the other hosts do.
He didn’t release it😂😂
Just because you were talking about basketball, the Blazers are going to win the finals and I'm definitely not biased at all...
the moving figures behind ryan bug me i can't stop looking at them
Can you do a podcast with Skitzo?
Dam Ryan wasn't kidding R Kelly actually said "suck my d**k" in I believe I can fly around 5:04. It's faint because he whispers it but it's there after the "whoa"
Ha! I knew you guys were dating! At the end of your book you said that you already found the girl of your dreams and I just knew because she's the only girl you spent a lot of time with ❤️
Looks like Paco is the President of the Ryden Club!
Just noticed will and greg’s painting behind paco 😂😂
imma telya rn yall aint lamer dan moi pourquoi tengo 18 anos y no he tenido mi primer beso todavia (aint dat s*it craaaazy?!)


btw yall prob assume dis alredy but I typed this all wit 1 hand. And my non dominant hand, to boot!
BgA comeback??? Im supa hyped!
I just want a Pewdiepie, Ryan podcast.
I love this video i can improve my english, i will stay with you guys
get kevjumba on the podcast
if you wanted to learn about bts and the fans you could have just asked me bro
Did Ryan say BGA is having a comeback ??
When Ryan says he posted something, and everyone goes to check and finds nothing
Get NigaHiga on Through the Wire 😂🔥
i love listening to this podcasts while studying :b its so calming
Yayyyy! BGA!
I love you. Nothing but an average fan I want to know exactly what's been going on in your life LOL
as soon as i saw “ Ryan’s Gf Revealed “ i clicked asap
Who else misses Dear Ryan?
1like = 1%chance Ryan Higa will bring it back
That moment when you've basically watched all Ryan's videos and the GF announcement didn't surprise you anymore. From ASS until the latest videos it has always been Ryden ❤️
Lol no R. Kelly didn't say that, if you listen carefully he says "Somebody feel me".
BTS in Korean stands for 방탄소년단 (Bangtan sonyeondan) which means bulletproof boys in English
Omg yesss I’ve been wanting a BgA comeback for so long
It's okay Ryan, we're not gonna crucify you in the name of BTS today.
R.I.P. Will's Camera. You will be missed.
What happen when to your podcast in Spotify I can’t listen to you guys 😭😡
Dear Ryan:
Can you do a video about how you get your haircut done? I can't find a good barber to cut my Asian hair but I used to have exact haircut like yours back in Asia.

Sincerely, broken glasses
Please have Arden Cho on the podcast✌

Edit: and Ryan's brother
Ever since.. "WELCOME BACK TO ANOTHER EPISODE OFFF.. I DARE YOUUU!" I kind of expected it. :>
When Pavo was asking if Ryan has kissed Arden I was thinking to my head have u seen ass(agents of secret stuff)
Im a cult member...sigh mom I failed you
Love listening to these to keep me company while doing homework :))
I SAW THE TITLE, I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD
Throwback to his “Every Romantic Movie” vid 👌👌👌
BLACKPINK outta nowhere. STAN BLACKPINK!!!!!!
Ah okay cool cool cool cool. 

deep down, screaming
Omg Ryan and Arden are dating 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ my life is complete
mark my words SeatGeek will take over the world. Soon the government won´t have to pay for public schools, they will all be sponsored.
Paco asking if they kiss is like all of the fans of ryden
I really love them talking about the hipster bit. I do the same things for no reason. I think subconsciously, i try to go against the crowd. I constantly ask myself why i am against something that's popular and realise i am being dumb
Uhhhh your podcast is not on Spotify no more
Beautiful intro 🎶😁
I need a shishi break before I react to this revelation 😅
I love these podcasts! They’re cool to listen to when I do homework.
This podcast makes me want more Paco
On the hipster topic, i'm a lot like Paco too and I realized that it's mostly bc of my possessive trait. When you like something and others start liking it too, it doesn't feel personal and significant anymore; so you just have the tendency to look for more lowkey things
I can confirm the meaning of BTS (or BDS) LOLOL.
Pirate 🏴‍☠️ captain PACO
I LOVE BEHIND THE SCENES
YEAH BTS ARMY
Can you do a podcast based around just anime😁😁😁
Ryan the sound in this episode is low than the usual.
I know Sean has a gf, but I kinda expected him to be Ryan's gf. Arden was my 2nd choice
4:01 Blinks triggered







Im just kidding!!!
I love Off the Pill Podcast. This is honestly so chill and I can actually do my homework assignments while listening to this.
Aww...!!! I'm so happy that you're happy! You two together makes me so happy!!!
love it! more podcasts :D
Insidegreenroom is such a good podcast!!!!!
i really like these podcasts to see a new side of ryan besides the comedian/creator. His thoughts and insights are always so interesting and thoughtful
I like will and Greg's dog painting above Paco.
I love how Ryan’s videos he throws the ads at the end, makes everything so much better to watch !
I knew when yall were dating when ryan ruined all arden's food instagram stories 😂. But where is this video? 👀
Dear Ryan, can you do a video where you enact out anime inspired memes?
She be sipping out that Mason jar - sneaky rich Brian reference
I saw "Ryan's GF" and immediately clicked lmao
Dear Ryan (only show this to his friends) yell out RYAN AND ARDEN SITTING ON A TREE K.IS.S.I.N.G and yell it in front of them😉
I love this content, its like we are getting to know them more and story telling 😻
36:08
You're Welcome
I knew it!! We knew it!!
And please do more parkourse I miss that
No, as an indonesian, that's a special kind of massage, when they burp, it actually showed that they're throwing out your disease. I don't know how that works, but that's the actual explanation. Believe it or not.
Have Jenna and julien on for the sports podcast and talk about UFC
Ryan briefly mentioning the lonely island was one of the best parts of this podcast
Somehow I find these podcasts so cathartic. It feels so chill and you guys never interrupt. Just me?
Lol love how personal these podcasts are getting!!
Is spur a basketball ball team I'm a  soccer fan and spurs is a team from London
I spent the whole video watching the bobble head thingies behind ryan on the left
Hey Ryan! really liking these type of videos you are doing lately, looking forward to listning to you guys again!
OMG YES A BgA COMEBACK!!
The figures moving in the top left still scare me
How dare you cheat on Greggina! XD
Army confession: I saw BTS, but I actually clicked for Ryan to officially announce that he's dating Arden.
Please react to Blackpink because they are great 😁
You should have a more specific talk about your first meet and friendship
Paco is a whole mood on Ryden XD <3
RIP Will's camera 💀
5:28 I mean Fire is a BTS song😂
I’ve been shipping you guys forever
I went to Texas de Brazil for valentines as well!
you should talk About what it's like being on the keto diet in an Episode in the future
So it's trueee! I had my suspicions! xD
BTS FANDOM?! RYANS GF?! OMFG 😂😂😂😂
36:14 i dont know what is it but just look
Dear,Ryan: can you make the ulitmate pizza
Lol ryan's first kiss sure is swirling a lotttttt hahahahhaha made me laugh
If you want to go on a basketball podcast, you could give amir's Buckets a try
TEXAS DE BRAZIL
Then Paco should really play Jump Force. I think it's fun but others don't thinks it's good enough
He should visit Jeremy Lin in Toronto
I knew it! You two are meant to be❤️
Will's camera dying should become a thing.
ANOTHER SONG?? WITH DAVID?? BGA?? THE KPOOPERS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!
Next podcast: "When we lose our vigini- " nevermind
Ahhhhh my ❤️!!! Arden and Ryan are dating!!! 😫
Please do your sports podcast
Lol.. that's how Indonesian massage done.. i know bunch of Indonesian people who's blurping when they give a massage.. its just like they found your aching part on your body and when they massage that part they will keep blurping.. 😂
Paco, why am I you when it comes to games 😔😔
Ever since this video came out, YouTube's been consistently recommending me every single video Ryan and Arden has been in together.
Ryden was just confirmed on Off The Pill. 

Off The Pill = OTP = One True Pairing

AN OTP WAS CONFIRMED ON OTP PODCAST!
YASSS BgA IS COMING BACK YO I'M SO HYPED
Wait do you livestream this firsthand?
Dear Ryan, could you make your very own Marblelympics?
someone turn up paco's volume
All lamps are shakiiiiinnnggggg
RYAN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO SOMETHING RELATED TO SPORTS, THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!!!!!!
i knew RyDen was happening!!!!
How do you get the microphone that gives out that podcast type of voice?
We knew it was confirmed when his friendship necklace with Sean was replaced by the   r i ng
I came for ryan’s gf, arden? idk haven’t watched the video yet
suggested guests:
RHPC girlfriends
YTF members
57:48 LOL Doing a little twister
57:02 Ryan's first kiss
I'm calling it right now. They're not dating. It's for the video and they're gonna prank us. I SWEARRRR!
:,((((
Lol I've watched every episode of this and I'm still completely interested!
I mean there not wrong at the 6:25 there are some hard Core army’s that give us and Bts a bad name and it’s sad that the few are seen as the many for our fandom:/
Nice seeing you guys having serious discussion. So happy abt you and Arden  though it wasn't a secret secret 💖
TBH I knew they were dating the entire time.
Please do wong fu productions!!!! Please!
HiCho FTW👑👑
I love how smoothly they transition from subject to subject
Lmao love how Ryan and Will treat Paco like a test subject.
I think a lot of people equate continuing to listen to a song to supporting it because so many people use Spotify and Apple Music, which is a (probably tiny) source of revenue! tldr just pirate music of people who you don’t like lol
lol only the og ones know theyve been dating for agessss through them expose videos hahahaa
Did anybody else experience any kind of glitches while watching this video?
I got my first kiss at a young age

.... what do you mean my mom doesn't count?
Is anyone able to listen to the podcast on spotify? I seem to have a problem. It wont load and said not found
"Learned English" is a little strong. They all know some English and can answer simpler questions but RM is the only one who's really good at speaking it. Unless they've gotten a lot better recently
I actually got into BTS because of you Ryan,,, thank u
Which tv channel can we watch these podcasts on
56:49 Ryan's first Kiss.
I like basketball tho. I'm from San Antonio
Hearing you guys confirm that Ryan and Arden are dating takes a weight off my mind. Like I just let out a breath that I didn’t know I was holding _(´ཀ`」 ∠)
I'd be intrested in a subreddit! :D
Aaahhhhh. I’m soooo happy for you two! I Love You guys! Best Podcast ever!
For those of you who don’t wanna watch the whole thing: Ryan and Arden Cho have been dating for a while - 36:15
I’ve been using the link and searching but I can’t find this on Spotify
SO EXCITED FOR BGA'S COMEBACK!!! Anyway for the masseuse to burp during a massage session is common in Indonesia, because we Indonesians believe that one sickness called "masuk angin"(literal translation: "enter wind") when you feel like you're under the weather or catching a cold, one of the traditional remedy is to be massaged where the masseuse sort of "absorbs" the wind inside your body and "exhales" it out. The other way is to have your back "dikerok"(can't think of a literal translation), in which someone puts some oil in your back and uses an old coin to make something like grilled marks in meat. You'll be expected to burp from the process, hence goodbye wind. 😂😂😂
Hey Ryan I love your videos but I have a question could you tell me how you got a rasengan in your videos
isn't Arden Cho the female lead from Agent of Secret Stuff???? HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN DATING
I feel like will is getting more comfortable and confident on the podcast or is now more engaged in the conversation and it's making me happy. Love that guy
BgA COMEBACK PREPARATIONS ARE IN PROGRESS K-POOPERS
only david has the right to do a sponsorship of SeatGeek
I thought shi shi break was spelled "xi xi break"
I think Paco is an enneagram 4. If you look up the psychology behind that personality type, it explains the whole "having to be different" thing. I know because I am one :)
Ryan a little information from the Philippines. They say that if a masseuse is burping while doing the massage, it means that they are releasing the tension that is coming from your body. My grandmother said that if they are burping that means they are doing a good job. Its a bit unhygienic but that is what we traditionally believe here 😀
For the first half of the podcast I genuinely thought the sponsor was Sea Geek and was so confused how the name had anything to do with buying tickets
Why does every youtuber just going into podcast
off the pill, the sport-related podcast shoud be off the court.
I soooo totally agree with Paco on not caring as much for “popular” trends. Paco has always been so good at elaborating his thoughts and ideas and i feel the exact same way!! I have a friend like Ryan who will friendly attack me for acting like a “hipster” but it’s not that way at all. :)
Another awesome podcast guys! I can never get into podcasts but y’all are my favorite :))
Took to damn long 😭
Please do a podcast with nba players
Yay Seat Geek! Yay sponsors!
Please talk about MMA or more Martial Arts!
Rian I'm from the big island too l love your videos
I totally agree with the BTS Fandom thing. The sad thing is you cam never get rid of any aggressive fans in a fandom. And every fandom has those protective people in it, its just BTS is spreading at a fast rate along with other kpop groups like NCT, EXO, etc etc. And you just hear bout them a lot. When news spreads like someone bashing BTS or sasaengs it spreads like wildfire. And you can never stop it
Here for Ryan’s girlfriend, stayed for BTS
dear Ryan can you please remake how to be Emo
4 energy drink in 1 day is toooooooo much !!!! it's not good for your heart !
Anime is finally real
Can't tell if he's kidding about the BgA comeback but i'm excited.
2019 is the year of podcasts
When we all knew he’s dating Arden lol i just needed their official announcement 😌
Next guest: Dom, Green, Jerel
I figured they were dating but I didn’t want to assume aything. It is their private lives after all.

Still a am very happy to hear actual confirmation.
Next step: bringing Arden on to the podcast😉
Can you create videos that we actually like watching (example: dear Ryan’s , tricksshots, a.k.a not podcasts
Is anyone really surprised he's dating Arden though? HAHAH
You should get Anthony Padilla and Smosh Pit on the Podcast.
“If you’re spending that much time on something, you’re bound to be good at it.”
Tell that to my video game skills

Also, hi Paco 👋🏻
the official intro sounds really nice tho?? idk i've replayed it like five times because it just sounds so strangely satisfying and it makes my ears happy
HECK YEA BLACK PINK AWESOME!!!!!!(i wish i could go to their concert)
You should definitely make a separate podcast about sports! Especially basketball! I'd be really interested, and I'm sure a lot of other people will be interested to see you perspective on it as well! It will be awesome! It can be called like "Off the Court Podcast"
Bga!!!!
ryan x bts members confirmed
YALL ARE SPURS FANS I LOVE YAll
I'll always watch your podcast till the end Ryan
I literally just bought tickets on seatgeek for the first time yesterday :'(
CONGRATS YOU FINALLY ANNOUNCE IT! I've been shipping you guys since Agent of Secret Stuff Video! which like 8 years ago?? hope it will last forever! love you both! 


Also, as an Indonesian, I can confirm that, a lot of massagers (?) that when they are on job they keep burping like almost all day. *AND IT'S NOT A PRANK*. probably because of the time you booked the massage,  but sometimes, it's not just after lunch,  because they actually did it before lunch too (the burping thingy). I still don't know why though *it's a mystery*, I hope you still love to come to Indonesia :(
Bring Michelle Phan and have her talk about the lucid dreaming (the one you talked abt in ur other podcast). Plus it’d be interesting to hear her talk abt her YouTube career (falling out, selling out etc). She’s also very smart so I’d love to hear her talk on diff topics.
do more sports
51:48 - 52:17: damn funny holocoaust joke.
Do your sports podcast with jeremy
I like doing the swirley swirls
RYARDEN IS OFFICIAL 👏 :') my 10 year old Agents of Secret Stuff fangirl self is QUAKING
please don't ever stop making these
I knew it!!! When u went to Hawaii I thought I heard Arden say baby, and you two shared a hotel room.
Do more "I dare you!" Please!! 😤😤
I saw BTS, I clicked
8:12 WHATS THAT I HEAR???? ANOTHER ONE
Can you make more videos besides off the pill
Why is seatgeek not available in Germany. They missed a market there 😭 People would totally use it here
bts stands for bangtan sonyeondan which translates to "bulletproof boy scouts" lol not fire poop (that should be a group tho xD)
If Paco reads this, I'm a lurker on your twitch, and it amazes me how good you are in conversations. Even when you're burned out, like in this video, you somehow make transitions hella smooth. Keep it up :)
I feel bad for you, your vedio view's , why person hate, these kinda vedio where they can learn more about, them 😢..
Anyone else here from SAT's post?
Paco is just asking the stuff everyone wants to know haha
I’m officially watching these when I workout now 🤩
Im sad u are be best YT in word  :D
So the next video is: Inside the mind of PACO





guys upvote this comment to make it real.
Its not the audiences responsibility to boycott an artist. That responsibility is on the firm/ organization to deal with them
man never stop these podcast !!
Omg I've been shipping Ryan and Arden for so long and had zero idea that they were actually dating!!
I made the mistake of going to the comments and it ruined the GF reveal for me. 😂 I should’ve watched the video first.
yesss BgA reunion
There's a reason why the Indonesian maseus were burping. So, supposedly, while they massage you they're taking in all the bad energy in your body and they release it by burping them out lmaooo
Honestly I thought some of them lived with ryan
I always knew that you are with Arden.. aw man, this just makes me so happy
Ryan bring back your lamps. Thanks.
Can we get Daina on one of these podcasts?
Dear Ryan, 
Can you create more Dear Ryans?
yes r/offthepill
Even though I'm a BTS fan I totally agree on the fact that some fans can be a bit too aggressive but the entire fandom isn't like that and like Paco said their songs are really inspirational and BTS does always preach kindness and love and hate it when their fans get aggressive. Ryan if you are reading this listen to their song spring day and watch the explanation video behind that. You will be touched. Trust me
OMG YES A BGA COMEBACK!!!!! CAN'T WAIT!
That intro was op xD
it would be so cool if you did a sports podcast with dan avidan from game grumps
Who else would love to see Greg and Daina on the podcast!?
pls APEX LEGENDS FAKE TRAILER
Ryan you are a genius about bts 4:44
Are they actually dating? Like I believe this is a joke, but I hope it’s not
Why does it feel like Paco is the host
These podcasts are fine, but dude, stay away from controversial topics as much as you can. As a former classmate, talking about those kind of things is going to make you lose subscribers because they don't agree with your point of view and you're going to have people arguing in the comments. Just...avoid them. Keep people in the dark about what you believe in, and it's fine to make fun of certain figures in your videos because everyone makes fun of someone else, but just keep it as that.
When I wanna focus on Ryan but the diamond play button keep on getting my attention.
Talk about the NBA more.
Dear Ryan, will you podcast with Arden please.......when  u guys stared dated is it b4 everyromance or after or on
What video his talking about revealing his dating
Can we have Stephanie Soo in the podcast she would be such an interesting person to have here.
This podcast was the best so far, imo and we also got to know that Paco used to be a drummer which is so cool
In portuguese "shi shi" is "xixi" (easier to type)
I still don’t understand how paco is single tho 🤷‍♀️ I’d date tf out of him, even when he first joined rhpc
I SHIP IT
Dear Ryan could you try to play one match of PUBG and get a chicken dinner
i'm disappointed the code wasn't NIGA 2:04
Please make other videos and not just pull podcast
That means.... pikachu is dating his mom.....
what happened to the spotify podcast :/
A BGA COMEBACK??
YOO FIRTS OFF I KNEW U WERE DATING ARDEN AND I APPROVE CAUSE U BOTH SEXY AS HELL, AND SECOND DO THE SPORTS PODCAST YESSS MOSTLY ON MMA THO BECAUSE ID LISTEN TO THAT SO HARD YOU SHOULD GET JOE ROGAN ON HERE
OMG BGA COMEBACK GUYS
I like these longer episode and whats your opinion on apex
i see bts i click
but also  bcs it is ryan
You were right in that one video I don’t like this Ryan am sorry I liked the teehee right 🤓😎🤪
Does Pako give off jealous single friend vibes?
Ryan is sooo shy to talk about Arden 💕
no way rich chigga is ur fan
OMG Yess they ARE dating. Ok, I'm not that excited cuz it's their lives, not mine but I actually kinda shipped them like, years ago. Finally here's the truth. 😂 Tbh, although I shipped them but I didn't expect them to be together(no offence, just didn't really expect it). I thought if he has a gf, it might be another person who's not in his videos and maybe he doesn't want to show her in his videos. Anyway, I'm happy for them. Wish they'll have a very happy life together. 😊
Ah yes, this is exactly what I need
6:06 PREACH 🙏🏻🙏🏻
freaking paco. I love him.
I just watched the Masked Singer on TV and when I saw that T-Pain won all I could think about was the part in Ryan’s “How to Sound Like Your Favorite Artists” with his T-Pain auto tune impression 😂
51:54 DEAD! The moment you realize it!!!
It’s means Burning The Stage ibthibk
25:27 ~ I feel like I agree with Paco on liking being different. On gaming i feel like it's just Paco not liking apex. But personally, and I think a lot of people agree, i dont like to admit to people/strangers that i do things that has a large group to it. Mostly because it might give a bad first impression since popular hobbies usually has both positive and negative stereotypes or something else people might be judgemental about. So i choose to talk about something relevant for the context me and the person/stranger are in. And of course it depends on context and what type of person i meet. And being (maybe weird) different gives attention which is some kind of aknowledgement. Which is what people like to get every now and then. I can understand why people would see it as being insecure. But I honestly just dont want to explain myself for something i like to do to a new person who might disagree to an extent where it's just a matter of personal preference liking. So i try to feel people out with time.
PACO hella funny 😂
They burped because your gas kinda transfers to them as they massage u!
Damit, I was just gonna fall asleep
I can't wait for the video where you announce .
yall really thought we didnt know you were dating
I can literally watch you guys talk for ages
BTS have a song called Fire😂
Imagine if his gf was never Arden and it ended up being someone else. Plot twist!
The ship has sailed everyone
can you do a 3d video vr
no views 100 likes?
youtube doing math or meth?
Dear ryan: can u pls stop making off the pill stuff
I wanna know how long they've been dating for
When did you become a Spurs fan?  I am from SA, and people there are just in love with them. Have never seen a fan from elsewhere.
8:04 its official. BgA comeback.
I saw bts fandom and I had to see what was goin on
I think we're all waiting for this video now lol
Paco's jumper looks cool, he is always so stylish
What happened to the spotify link?
Blackpink is great
Bring Kevjumba one day pls!!!
I really thought the sponsor was called seekdick untill the subtitles came along
I need to find all the subliminal messaging now!
I never knew about Ryan's date but if the thought ever came up Arden was the only person I could think of, ever since that A.S.S. video. Wasn't sure if she was still around coz I never saw her in another video (far as I remember).

The "Ask the question 'Why?'" thing is similar to asking people to be more empathetic. It does make things not as bad when you consider that people aren't NPCs that are just acting the way they do just coz and maybe it's not about you or them. But many of those who act so terribly just aren't empathetic, they don't ask the question.
Dear Ryan: can u make a fake marvel Vs DC trailer
Imagine having Ryan as a dad and Arden as a mom, it would be so cool.
YOU SHOULD PUT AN ADVERT DURING THE SHISHI BREAK!! YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO, NO ONE WILL HATE YOU FOR IT!! :D
Is it bad that I know all of the words to who's it gonna be? And I speak English?
After all these years oh my god
idk who he's dating but I already ship it
38:00 are you sure Mr Higa? 😏 😁😁
PACO IS THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL LAMPS
a sports podcast would be sick
everyone is going to get old in the next 10 years excited to see how things will MASSIVELY CHANGE
Its official!!! 💓💓💓 huhuhu sooo happy for themmm 😭
Ryan and Arden! This is so perfect! I remember watching their YouTube movie when they became a couple. hehe
Ok I like paco now
Shi Shi Break.....when was that a thing???
Dear Ryan: what type of people do food delivery guy meet ?? What's in their mind??
I can already hear all Ryden shippers losing their minds rn. Honestly, I cant think of a different girl to be with Ryan
Likes pubg... Calling it original... please :(
Good call on moving on from sports. lol
why do you always do off the pill podcasts i want the more innovative videos the awesome creative ones
Who else watches these podcasts to the end because they love rhcp and want to support whatever they do and also genuinely love to see the "real" side of him?
Omg BGA I’m excited! Anyone else excited!
Spotify link isnt working, i was gonna listen in my car on my way to school. :((((
I, for one, like your channel because of the diversity in content
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Can you beatbox? Or a cover of napom roll like this?😃
I wasn't very interested in Paco before but since these podcasts I really like his personality and what he does in them. Great job!
lol at "shi shi" break! thought it was only used in South-East Asian countries, like Malaysia or Singapore >.<
rip ryan's adhd 0,0 diverted taco's sponsor try to "black pink"
Its common for masseuses to burp because your gastric acid is being recieved and relieved by them. Thus, they release those by burping
Time stamp about Arden please 😁
No views. 50 likes? Off to a good start
Love these new podcasts :)
This epi is ✨💎
Danny Green....UNC Tarheels!
Please make a discord ❤️
Well at least ONE Ryden is real 🙄 oof
I actually think it's normal for  the masseuse to burp while they massage bc they do that in here in PH. SOmething about passing on the cold from your body to them, then they burp it out. IDK if it's the same thing
I only clicked on this video for BTS, but I just wanna hear them talk about it but idk when they start to talk about them so pls someone in the comments, put the time when they start talkin about it. Lol.
Like if the same thing happened to u:)
hardcore army on youtube is so annoying, it is honestly so sad how we support such an amazing group of people but people like those types of army give us a bad name. i love your podcasts it’s so relaxing for me for some reason
He also got her a gold plated flower
matt davela! I want to see you with matt!
Anyone else jump on this video because BTS was in the title? I love Ryan, but not into podcasts so have not been watching those videos. But at 51 I admit I am ARMY all the way. 

Black Pink is becoming big as well, but definitely not as big as BTS. They are watching BTS closely to see the things that are working for them and then doing the same thing ie. collaborating with western artists. This then in turn has helped to make them the number one female Kpop group right now. 

Ryan I have never heard the "meaning of BTS" as you have stated it. It's always been Bangtan Sonyeondan, Bulletproof Boyscouts, and later for English fans Beyond The Scene. But then again I'm not Korean so...
you guys should make a seperate channel for the off the pill pocast
I remember this guy from "How to be a Gangster".
The whole time I was staring at the geisha rocking in the back 😂😂
As if we didn't know hahaha
Literally every fandom has that loud toxic minority regardless of the artist's message unfortunately.
PLEASE DO THE  NBA PODCASTS
i loved u but if u wanna do this do it but i wont watch sry
I would agree that Army is sort of a cult fandom and yes, we can be overbearing but most of don't want to spread hate. Fandoms are a reflection of the band itself and we don't want others to think that BTS is just a group of good looking boys with toxic fans, but we cannot control everyone. We have so many arguments within our own fandom because many fans are superficial or just support one member and shit on others. Every community has bad apples, and bigger the community is, bigger are the chances of your meeting those bad apples.
I don't know u guys read this but...
Burping is sign the massage working,
Its better their burping or their will get sick bcs of amount of gas not came out. Their sick like dierhea?.
I burping massaging people too. My mom tho
I mean, bts is not cinsidered the most succesful but they are competing hard with EXO atm, so they both are pretty big and succesful.
Hey guys, still loving the podcast! I'm so happy to have something to listen to in the week... at least that's what I say to myself before I listen to the whole episode on the spot lol. Do any of yall listen to Sam Harris?
I'm sorry you got some bad experiences with our fandom. Some Army are truly immature but not all of us are like them! 💜
HE’S BEEN DATING ARDEN!!! 36:16
Paco is literally us, lamps.
WE KNEW IT ALLLLL ALONGGGG
Y'all should do a sports podcast
I KNEW IT! I ALWAYS GOD DAMN KNEW IT!
Make more skits its what made you popular
I saw ryan and arden holding hands in LA in the arts district a year ago... i was like what...
I just wanted to say that I very much enjoy this trio (Will, Ryan and Paco) on the podcasts. Like the episodes with this group have been my fav for sure. The conversations go along nice, not to mention, the topics are always fun and interesting. And you 3 are all very much enjoyable in your own ways. I mean I've enjoyed all the podcasts and guests that have been on. But I just know when its this group in particular it's going to be a good time! 👐
React to blackpinkkkkk
I kind of already knew Ryan was dating Arden,  but I didn’t want to be annoying and pester Ryan and Arden about it so I just kept quiet. I thought they were keeping it private and low-key so I’m just really happy that Ryan officially announced it! Like it’s LEGIT now. 🥰

I loved this episode (and all the previous ones - there’s not one that I DON’T love). I laughed a lot! You guys always give great content - even when you are all exhausted. Thank you for that! 💪🏽

I just wanted to add on a bit more about your massage experience in Indonesia. I think it’s an Asian thing. At least that’s how it is from where I’m from, Malaysia (and Indonesia, according to what you experienced). We have this thing where we have “angin” in our body. A direct translation of the word “angin” would be “wind” but in this case it’s more to flatulence. You know when you’re bloated and you burp / fart and gas comes out? That’s flatulence, occuring in your stomach due to digestive processes. So “angin” is gas but it’s all over your body, especially in the joints. That’s what we call “angin”. And usually people have massages to get all that “angin” out. Because all that gas is messing with our joints and making our bodies feel heavy. Apparently, it seems like only Asians experience this condition. That’s why your masseuse burped. Because of all the “angin” in their body. When they massaged you, they’re exercising their hands in a way that’s making the gas come out of their own bodies too. At least, that’s what I think personally. My friend who studies medicine says there’s no such thing, and it’s a myth we made up. Maybe it’s a psychological thing since it’s been passed on for generations now. But many,  if not all, experience this, in Asian countries. So don’t worry, it’s not a prank! 😂
Ryan has a sponsor? Wow, what a sellout
I like BTS, I just dislike the fandom, mostly new ARMY fans. I started with BTS as one of my first kpop groups in 2014. Then I heard of BIGBANG then they open the door for more groups and now I'm a GOT7 igot7. I started to notice that a lot new fans coming into kpop was just in for BTS, causing a lot of problems with other groups. New ARMY hating on groups cause they weren't as big as BTS. I like BTS, I still support them but I don't consider myself a ARMY. No hating just my opinion.
Yo Ryan, you should put these podcasts on Spotify. You could get a lot of celebs to listen to it on the go for inspiration.
I would love a basketball podcast btw
TH3 V1D 1SNT H3R3.    1S TH15 4 J0K3
When the video about ryan’s gf hasnt come out yet
I'm so glad nobody is gonna play Ignition anymore
36:16 who Ryan is dating
I'm so happy for you guys 💞
Boy bands aren’t really bands. They don’t play any instruments. Boy bands are really just “music groups.”
Ask fatal grips for a sponsor
RAPTORS AND BTS AND ARDEN CHO


GETTTUUUUMMMMM
ok did he just talk about ryden after two years of lamps investigating? lmfao we stan
Yeah loool every one knew yall were dating but congraaatz 😂
More MMA Content Ryan
Tell us how you two met or started?
You should start a Discord as well as a sub reddit
6:30-7:07 I'm actually dying laughing 🤣🤣🤣 I remember being just as confused back then everytime I saw the comment section for the behind the scenes vids on higatv.... But now I'm lowkey a fan of bts lol ARMYS WYA
The burping thing is apparently a way to release bad energy or the pain relieved from the one being massaged!
oh cool! Happy for you guys :-)
I listen to this podcast while playing games...
I love listening to these on my commute
June 2019 Wedding ?
hey ryan hhahaha just wanna share about that burping thing 
wasnt aware they do that in Indonesia too but here in the Philippines when someone who is massaging you does that it means you have "lamig"(cold, but the way we understand it in that matter is cold air) inside your body that may cause discomfort, body pain, and other stuff too but it isnt dangerous LOL. the burping thing is a way of removing it from you funny right but yeah hahaha thats what they say...
Can you do more games like spyfall fakin it mafia etc pls
Ryan I'm sorry but I have to remind you that you were going to upload that special video 3 days ago.. today is 28....
I just watch all of ryan's videos in order on loop soooooooo
Ryan thought K-pop was dying? You innocent child.
OKG LOL THE BURPING STORRRRYYYYY 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think we all knew since long ago that ryan and arden was a thing lmao
@Ryan, Indonesian women actually like to burping when they are massaging, I'm Indonesian, but I actually don't know why are they doing it. LOL
yoooo get Arden on OTP!!!
I suspected it to be Arden since a couple months ago from their Instagram posts
BgA is coming back?!?!?!
no yall are right we a CULT
Dear Ryan can you do backflips?
30:30 - 30:45
Blackpink has surpassed BTS as the most famous KPOP group right now. Love the podcast, keep it up!
5:17 I hope he knows that it actually stands for bangtan sonyeondan
Omg... who the hell is Arden Chay!?!
love the intro
will’s “get em!!!” while ryan was talking about his first kiss was the highlight of this video
this is the most we've seen Will talk
Hahahahahhahah... before Ryan said it ... we already knewwwwww😂😂😂😂
Hahahahahhahah... before Ryan said it ... we already knewwwwww😂😂😂😂
35:52 "im dating arden"
I am so glad that you keep doing what you love, and not just look at the numbers, because I am REALLY enjoying these podcasts! You guys are great!
Did anyone else expect this whole video to just be a troll
Anyone got a list of all his subliminal messages???
Hey guys I know the focus of this podcast is a lot about Arden and Ryan, but on another note, 

I was listening throughout and just wanted to let you guys know that as a person who goes for massages often, the Indonesian masseurs were burping because that’s what happens to your masseurs if you (the client being massaged) have a lot of “wind” in your system and these are transferable to your masseur during your massage sessions . Trying checking it up online !
5:43 that's true tho. A lot of their fans are really great but some go completely against what BTS is trying to say. But most are really good. Love their songs tho. They have a great mix of fun and meaningful songs
Off the pill podcast is so random 😂
I can't get enough of these
I actually agree with Ryan on most stances. He's a moderate who knows where to draw the line. 

ALSO PACO, THAT'S A FREAKING BRILLIANT IDEA. I HAD THIS IDEA LIKE TWO MONTHS AGO, AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE. SPREAD THE WORD, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
Let me explain as an Indonesian person to you guys about the burping when ryan and crew have a massage 33:54 . Its quite common in Indonesia to you to hear the person that do the massage burping for few time while they massage you. Indonesian (but not all) belive that when they burping means they have receive your "Masuk Angin" to their body and kinda make the burping a habit but not a culture.
WAIT RYAN IS DATING SOMEONE??!!
please do another parkourse
Congrats!!!!!!!!!$ yayayyaayyayayayaya
Only 1(RM) of the 7 members of BTS is fluent in English. The rest are very, very basic with words. They understand more than speak.
I’ve been watching all of them and the moment I saw relationship I gasped and then I saw BTS and I gasped even higher hahaaha YES
Lol all the lamps knew this before

i wanted them to continue to talk about basketball lol
Ah, Ryan, its okay. We all know you’ve been dating Greg.
I am so happy about this podcast
Yes please make that subreddit
He's dating Arden we been knew
Oh I thought he was dating Greg...
dude everyone knew arden and ryan were dating😂
You used to be first on YouTube
Dear Ryan can you make a trailer about the trends for the past few years...
I would listen to Hitler's fire hits



Its going to be 
I really want to see Ryan and Jackson Wang from GOT7 in one video. I heard some people said that they look alike
but did you kiss?!?!
I was told that masseuse burps because when they massage, they help to push out the toxins and gas from their clients so they tend to have a huge amount of gas in them. Hence, the burping. Not sure if this is true though.
Can you please make more animated videos like "how to escape a horror movie"?
Dear Ryan,  have you heard of EXO? 😄
my assumption is that Big Bang is bigger than BTS and BlackPink is from the same agency (YG) as Big Bang
Aka Paco being roasted and weird for 1 hour straight
You guys should talk about Michael Jackson and the whole  scary Neverland situation!
AHHHH. YOU GUYS ARE DATING??? YASSSSSSSS
You have a girlfriend...





MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
Ooft thank you for 69 likessss
which part is Ryan;s GF Revealed ?
off the pill with the skitzo characters??
I guess it's changed from the days when Ryan made another Lonely on Valentine's Day video. But I've always waited for the day he'd get a girlfriend
Bring back Will and Greg show and Wild cards. Do a better show contest
Ryan's GF, BTS, and his first kiss in one episode?? SIgn me up!
56:56 is were they talk about first kiss
HOST 👏 MEME 👏 REVIEW 👏
Wait what video saying you have a girlfriend?
I personally enjoy Chris Brown as an artist, he has thrown bangers throughout his days yet I'm aware of  how he is as a human and the actions he has commited but that won't make me stop listening him. I agree with Paco.
Would love a basketball podcast
It feels kinda weird seeing Ryan being serious  in real life, kinda shows how really calm and cool he is to his crazy, raunchier online personality.
I wonder if they have tried League of Legends before
I don't think it matters if you like the artist or not, as long as the art is good. Personally, it's not anyone's business whether you like it or not, anyways.
im too early, i'll comeback later when the time stamp guy comments
13:25 I wonder if Will plays DnD
Dear Ryan, can you do a video about magic and mythical animals. Pls 🦄🦕🐉
BTS (behind the scenes) nation
I’D LOVE TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL
I was jumping when i saw the intro ! I didn't see that coming xD and now i'm on the floor listening to the podcast instead of studying for my exam tomorrow
pubg is a good game
I signed up on their new sponsor.  I hope that counts though I don't have any plans on going to a concert for now.
20:46 About to say the f word
Many artists i listen to I don't even know how they look like, where they are from, how old they are and if they are a "good" person 😅.
I'm an Army and I love Ryan higa ❤️❤️💕💕
joe rogan on the podcast would be cool
I’m sure everyone called it haha. I’m glad that it’s officially been confirmed though! Ryan and Arden are so cute together. ☺️💕

Lilly Singh has left the chat.
Dear Ryan, Can you bring back teehee time? :)
People burping while massaging in my country is normal. I think it’s the cold in your body transferring to them and they release it??? Irdk but the burping thing is normal in my country
Dear Seatgeek,
David dobrik and now Ryan higa 
Thanks for sponsoring my favorite youtubers :D
Dear ryan can u make a 7 ring parody?
U used to be the most subscribed YouTube channel once 😢 I feel bad
u continue Ryan I know u got his continue please yayayayayaya code higa
How could you possibly mess up black pink LOL paco. It’s okay you’re a fan
I don’t even care about Ryan’s GF, I just love this podcast!
Tbh I think you can like the art and not the artist. You can appreciate any craftsmanship created by anyone, doesn't mean you have to support it. But sometimes when your moral veiws are challenged by the artist as a person your opinion on the art can change. Per example my favourite band in the whole wide world was Brand new. 3 days before I was set to go see them live it came out that the lead singer had sexually harrased underage girls. They cancelled their tour and you bet I got my money back. I do not listen to them on spodify, and I illegally listen to maybe a hand full of their songs bc I still appreciate their music, it was different and complex however I can't listen to it in the same light - I would listen to all of their albums on repeat. But the appreciation of it hasn't changed. I will always draw inspiration from the complexity of their music but I will never support it again. X
Ryan ... Where is the video where you announce it
Raptors are 2nd in the east and 2nd in the league. In front are the bucks, and behind are the warriors. Jeremy gonna be a star bench leader. I hope that they let Jeremy lead the bench
39:14 honestly me
One critic I have after watching 4 episodes is can you guys turn the volume up on the mics please? Quite soft sometimes...
You don’t do dear Ryan anymore so dear Ryan make a parody of despacito
PLEASE MAKE MORE AND PUT ADS IN WE DONT MIND!!!!!!
My belief is that you always can enjoy the art of someone even if you absolutely despise the person
Dear Ryan, can you walk up to one of your friends and take their banana and run.
Yes... Seatgeek... I am familiar with it.. thanks David
9:56 That is so cool ! (;
U should start that b-ball side podcast
I really like the set up , so many memories
Name the second podcast Off the Ball
Love seeing the diamond play button in the background for Ryan 👍
are we even surprised that they are dating
The topic about liking art but disliking the artist... I love chick fil a but the owner is anti-gay. Pero their chicken... is juicy...
Paco needs to play siege
haaaaayyyyy i dint even get the notifaction
Pewdiepie as guest on Off the Pill Podcast
Hold up a BgA comeback ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ? i'm not ready my wallet isn't ready
Girlfriend part at 36:14
I know this is random but who remebers in 2011 when he was number 1 subscribed chanell on yt
The thing is that if someone says smth bad abt BTS then ofc we are gonna jump into it and be aggressive we want to defend them its normal. There are some fans that lose their shit and we try to stop them from talking as much as we can. Thank you so much for your kind words and for mentioning the messages in their songs :'( it rly means a lot
BGA COMEBACK YEAAYY
you guys should try to do this live
of OF OFF the PILLLLLL
Lol I must be so hipster because I refuse to play Fortnite no matter WHAT and for anything popular
I had my first kiss with a more experienced dude, and after it happened he gave me advice on how to kiss lollll it was so embarrassing
26:21
Paco doesn't like being a normie.
Dear Ryan, can you sing cerberus by abra,loonie,ron henley for me?
I'm going to use my BGA Tickets!!!!!!!!!!!!
PREACH PACO, PREACH. KPOPPIES LOVE U
Edit: Ryan, I will love RHPC forever if u have more BGA, it's the reason I found BTS
It's yalls fault that im apart of a cult fandom
Also will paco be a new member in BGA like how in NCT they add members all the time?
If u talk about sports, I'll still listen to ur podcast (ball is actually my favorite)
The burping thing isn’t a prank, ryan! Almost every massager do that because......... you know when you get cold sometimes your stomach is full of air... you feel like farting or burping but the air just doesn’t come out. That’s when you usually get a massage in indonesia. The air that filled up your stomach is somehow magically transferred to the massager which causes him/her to burp all the time. Maybe it’s just an indonesian thing🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I love the fact they have a sponsor
FINALLY!
why do i sense so much tension in this podcast?
as soon as i saw bts i immediately clicked
Bring back cooking but not really
BLACKPINK GET EMMM
Omg bga #3 AAHHHH!!!!💕💕
Ryan is a homebody. Wow! This is new to me.
Chris Pratt doesn't support the gay community. He's not anti-gay, he just doesn't support it. As you may enjoy the art without supporting the artists, Christians, for the most part, enjoy the company of people in the gay community but do not support them. We won't set them up on dates with the same gender, but we don't hate them and are not "anti." That suggests an aggressiveness. Some people are aggressive, but not most. Anti implies that we are against the person; we're against the actions they partake in with members of the same sex.
A nigahiga subreddit would be cool
we already know you’ve been dating for  a while now the lamps are not surprised wasn’t a secret but it was pretty obvious !! i now have two favorite youtube couples melix and ryden thanks lovebirds
Damn they already said it! "They're NOT bigger than BTS" see what I mean?
Yeah guys as a kpop fan 
BTS fans are agressive and some of them are rude
Ryan how have u not heard of Blackpink 😞😂
Do a off the pill on your high school life
Paco knows what we want to know :-)
I have a friend who is a contrarian and it’s pretty annoying sometimes, the fact that he chooses the opposite of what is popular just because
5:52, okay Ryan now I always hear that question. "how, can you understand it even if you don't speak that language?" And I always thought that was not a good question for someone to ask like it's the same thing with people when they blast despacito and you really don't see no one question them listening to despacito because it's Spanish music so I never really understood why people would ask that just because Kpop is Korean you can literally just look up lyrics or you can learn the language and that's another reason why I really hate that question but hey you know what that's cool.
I don't  like off the pill videos
23:19 perfect Greg face.
41:25 Ryan talks about Rich Brian and their ‘meetings’ on Ryan’s visit to Indonesia
Ryan should start his sponsors with “has this ever happened to you?”
being “hipster” is kinda becoming mainstream so doesn’t that go against the very definition of hipster ?? just a thought.....
In my mind I always knew How to be Ninja 2 was boring
Dear Ryan can you do a Q/A video
Can u please play minecraft on ur second channel please?
see like i do that 'hipster' thing too almost unintentionally but for me it's more about how the thing gets too much hype that i dont think it really deserves. one big example is the hype around frozen, when i first saw it i thought 'yea this is ok its pretty good', but then everyone else blew it out of proportions and just made it seem like the best thing ever which made me end up hating most frozen related things. im not trying to be different (atleast i dont think?) i just dont think certain things deserve all that hype
This better not be clickbait!!
Dear Ryan, do the shoes trick shots idk
its so cute how they have no idea about the kpop community
BTS who? im waiting for BgA
Damn i'm liking Paco.
i see bts i click
It would be funny if Ryan's mom commented.
What is your funniest family story?
When is the next skit coming?
Does anyone know what video they’re referring to at 35:49??
Having a nigahiga subreddit would be hella cool!
Dear Ryan could you make a role parody
Ryan is the star and Paco is like the true host heheh
I’m still waiting for the BGA lightsticks
Paco you da man! ahaha.
MMA podcast would be epic
36:11
BgA COMEBACK Pleaseeee
37:15 the best moment 37:15
Ryan should have an episode only with himself, god what a conversation that would be.
Yes!!! Loving the podcasts! Keep them coming!

Dude these podcasts are seriously good. I have always enjoyed your videos but i am enjoying these podcasts even more than your usual content. It feels weird to say this because i find your usual stuff to be some of the best content on youtube. Keep it up :)
you should arden cho as a guest
People are missing out on good content. Just checked Ryan's page and saw that his podcast vids have relatively low views. It has good content, just a little bit different from what we are used to. I kinda let it go for a while, but when I started to watch, I really appreciated it. Especially when Paco is around.
Yo that lazy extrovert thing is so true lol. I'll go buy groceries and come home like damn I got a lot done today
Keep it up with these podcasts! Love them~

Dear Ryan can you do a dear Regina?
There is 2 Ryans
Egghead Ryan
And Ryan
I love seeing @yellowpaco being active in the comment section of these videos
Ryan " I listen to podcasts in background, I don't look I just listen"
Me stops typing my homework "...wow..."
Ryan Please bring BgA back and do a song with Arden Cho!!! Please!!!!!!
I would like Ryan to upload one video where he goes all smart and deep to see if I would get it, and then to see his "dumbed" or translated to simple people version of the same video :DDDDD. Now I really want to see it. Can we make it happen? Dear Ryan, can you do this? :D
Do an episode with PewDiePie!
Hafu asked if we’d watch Ryan doing a music career... BGA was hella successful
Invite Regina and other skitzo members
Bring KevJumba on a podcast ryan!!!
My mother graduated college with honors in two separate courses but she has absolutely no common sense. She is book genius but street stupid, but I still love her to death.
Bring back Paco on the next podcast... Pretty please
Oh shit Hearthstone players on nigahiga?? Never thought I would see that one day.
I agree with her. You should totally make a video of your process of making videos. That’d be cool!
I don’t have a single clue who these guys are, but I’m sure to finish the podcast anyway.
Arden cho and Jeremy Lin as guests!
44:13 aww Paco so cute, I've always known he was smart
I just wanted to point out that the Myers-Briggs type indicator test does not give a 100% valid indication of one's personality, and also people are not exclusively "visual" or "auditory" learners. Another misconception is that people are "left-brained" or "right-brained." It's a myth. We talked about these topics in my AP Psychology class. Just thought I would share so people are better informed :)
Top Hearthstone players? Where's Toast D:
Ryan-explain stuff about background noise

Other guy-background noise

Me-im beigg watched
Twitch streaming sounds like what I imagine hell is.
People I want on the podcast : kevjumba, Jeremy Lin, d trix, ricegum, or anyone from YTF
Hafu shouting out my man Day[9].  Man I never comment on youtube, but feel like I should just to say that I've watched all the streams and loved them all.  Didn't expect these two streamers to show up on one!  Really entertaining stuff.  Oh and as someone from Hawaii, stream 3 was a lot of fun with the 808 gang.  Also I'm a Punahou grad so was so cool when Paco talked bout Punahou in one too haha.  Keep it up you guys!
Feeling called out a bit because Ryan said he listens to podcasts while he's doing something else, and I listen to these while I do my homework...
Collab with Liza Koshy and Smosh
I really enjoy watching and listening to your podcasts Ryan, the topics u guys r talking about are really interesting!
"Northern lion super show"...
Where’s the dude that puts all the topics and times
Dear ryan:-
Can you make a hanate 
Special rap song.
It should be on " I stay home,cook rice"
After watching this podcast , I feel like I m the new Sherlock Holmes
Nice suggestion hafu at 48:00 RYAN SHOULD DO ITTTT
Ryan you should start streaming!!
Dear Ryan, can you do this podcast with skitzo members?
15:31 I was actively watching and listening to the podcast and I am offended
Man i was waiting for this for ages! Thank you RYAAAANNNN

Edit: WHY IS IT ONLY 58 MINS D:
Only podcast I want to watch, so so good! :) I have recommended it to my friends as well. Keep up the good work. I have been following your channel pretty much from the beginning
They note that people watch podcasts in the background while they do other things. Am I the only one who pays attention and watches 100% of these podcasts? At least I do with Ryan's podcasts.

Anna Akana
Kevin (kevjumba)
Phil (wongfu)

I did not put on a lipstick one day, going to the class and one guy literally asked my friend why did I look pale.
1 or 2 months later ,Ryan will be uploading full movies on his channel
I think being smart is the ability to think dynamically. Book smart/being knowledgeable can usually be quite singular thinking (I.e memorised/regurgitated information) it’s the main reason I think that in school you learn so much information but only retain a small amount AFTER the exam. 

Being able to come up with original thought, problem solve, think outside the box, Thinking analytically or being calculating are all things that involve being smart in my opinion. Meaning creatives, entrepreneurs, business owners are most likely the smartest as they look to think on their own rather than being told what to think
Dear Ryan, can you put your next video's thumbnail literally a thumb's nail... That would make a great Pun
Love from India 😍😍
This is 10x better than any other podcast.
i actually really look forward to ryan’s podcasts every week,, i only really started listening to podcasts this year bc of him — i hope you keep doing nore podcasts 🥰💘
Dear Ryan
Can u please do a judo match with your brother??
I think you mean DOTA 2 Auto Chess Streamers
Whenever I hear the clapping, I always expect someone to suddenly yell "Meme Review!"
Do a podcast about pewdiepie vs t series
Why do I feel like his videos are getting less views than they did before
And....AHEM....they are not using hyperX headphones..(+_+)
More like top Dota 2 Auto Chess streamers LOL
Still loving these podcasts, thank you for posting them! :)
WAIT...wait I feel like something in the preview wasn't in the actual podcast @__@
Don't think I've ever commented on youtube in the last few years but just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this so please keep it up!
"Yeah, it's not about the money, I don't really care"

5 min later 

"Would you literally play with your life to get a shit-ton of money?" 
"HELL YEAH"
0:26 Mr beast? 😄🤔
I actually watch all of this. 58 minutes of my life, holy shit. Rip
deep vein thrombosis - ryan u were probably thinking of this.
Dear Ryan, can you do a chair flip please
+1 Like if you agree
Loved this episode, especially the whole intelligence talk. 
My two cents on the topic: i think being smart is way more than your iq score. 
Yes, iq is part of the intelligence measurement, but not the only aspect. Communication, memory, perception, creativity, judgement and many more are factors that influence the level of someone's intelligence. 
I feel that the whole smartness thing is similar to beauty. For example, height is something that is considered attractive, but being tall doesn't make you instantly attractive. Same with iq; a person can have a very high iq, but if they dramatically lack in all the other aspects, they are considered less smart than someone who has a lower iq, but their levels on the other aspects are higher and more balanced.
before we had conventional radio podcasts so we kinda always were interested in hearing people talk its that its much more accessible nowadays
Please keep the podcast up! Im loving the discussions!
Listening to Ryan Higa podcasts is my ASMR.
Ryan is just so DOWN TO EARTH I love it❤
You guys realize that whenever Ryan says "we'll put up those shoutouts on these little (digital) cards" nothing actually appears, right? lol, who's the editor?

I always feel like I've a lot to share when watching this podcast, they talk about down-to-earth topics and sciency/human behaviour stuff that I feel like would be nice to talk about.

About intelligence, I had kinda come to a conclusion on how I define it after watching Sherlock. Seeing how he figures things out using his  from all kinds of different fields and how he  them to solve problems in largely unrelated fields like homicide made me think "Oh boy, now that's intelligence, applying your knowledge to solve any problem or answer any question". It's true that what school tests you on is knowledge, and with things like math/calc & programming in uni it tests your critical thinking, I think intelligence is how you make connections between your  and your *knowledge*, it is how scientists of the past just looked at the sky and figured out the size and orbits of those celestial bodies.

About conveying/communicating your intelligence to others, that's a problem of  and is a totally different skill that IMO needs to be taught and learned through experience more than most other skills (not really something you just have a talent for), and it would seem those hyper intelligent people who lack common sense lack the empathy and social awareness to understand people's behaviour and what it conveys. Emotional intelligence is an increasingly important skill I think and lacking from many nowadays, at the same time the connectedness of the internet and its use in marketing/business/personal growth has made the knowledge of behavioural psychology a bit more accessible. I think introverted people tend to be better at this coz they tend to carefully observe their surroundings more than extroverts, they can, for e.g., see how someone reacts to every word they're hearing. And finally, psychopaths while lacking any empathy seem to be experts at manipulating human behaviour and can even 'mimic' whatever they want others to think they're feeling, supposedly coz they learn it like a science that they can apply to achieve their goals.

Sry for the landslide
Woo! Just finished ep 3 on my way home just in time for ep 4! 😁
Love the podcast!
I liked this stream. This is was a good stream in my opinion.
Seeing Ryan's notes would be cool!

Get to see how you create so much awesome stuff throughout all these years
Please make a video with Arden, Jeremy Lin or Kevjumba
The dankcient one





Go to darkkmane’s heathstone video if you don’t understand the joke
This is my favourite podcast. I'd listen to it daily if I could.
I really dig these podcast. I normally don't listen to podcasts, but for some reason, I listen to Ryan's.
"Having someone with you" - that's exactly it
Actually if you didn’t know, the whole right brain left brain thing is a myth. Your right brain does control the left side of your body, and vise versa, yet the side of your brain is not correlated to your personality. Love the podcast tho, keep it up!
36:46 His face 😂
i hope you dont stop these man if they dont blow up, loads of people really enjoy these! one of the best podcasts outhere - if not the best!

You need to do more of those Primitive videos.
He used to film twice a month in his house with his friend and now has his own podcast
Do a podcast with Arden and talk about how long you've been dating!😍😍😍😍😍
Best one ya stayed on topic...
Hey Ryan Higa you are really awesome.
lots of love from INDIA!!!!
Podcast with Arden? Yes yes yes!
THREE WORDS:
MAKE A SKITZO REUNION.
(if you include the “a”.)
Aww Ryan is praising Paco ,,, that’s cute
He mentioned FAIRY TAIL, oh yes!
I loved hearing “Get ‘emmm” at the beginning 😄
Also, her voice sounds soo much like Vanessa Hudgens💜
17:17 NLSS shout out ... Woooo
When Ryan world's collide
Bring in Northernlion! Bring in the other Ryan, Ryan!
Favorite podcast. Thank you! 🖤
Loving the fact that Ryan is updating much more!
Being smart is how fast you can learn and how you can modify, change, build off of, and Innovate on that subject. 
Like how Einstein founded new math concepts, he innovated, and changed the way people think about different things.
that my opinion.
Love your podcast!!! And I also would like to watch your profress of making a skript. :D
Nobody: 
itsHafu: 🖐✋👋👈👉
Really love the podcast. Makes me feel like I'm actually part of the conversation
Dear Ryan, do the Vogue 73 Question Interview with Regina!
Can you pleaaassseeeee get KevJumba to come back for an episode?! We’d love to hear where he’s been!! And what he thinks of youtube now!
15:30 that something to keep me sane while i test my dbfz combos for hrs x.x
i listen to Ryan's podcasts while doing origami y e e t
Ryan is the best youtube. Pwediepie not even 10% of ryan

Thanks for the likes thou
I disagree with that definition of smart. Capability of learning is one thing but I think what's more important is being able to apply those topics and develop new concepts to add to our current knowledge base. For example, when you think of Einstein, you think he's smart because he developed quantum mechanics/physics. It's not just he was able to learn it from someone. It was that he understood what was happening, created hypotheses, and applied those theories to reality. Also, with David, you could consider that he is smart because he understands the mechanics of the game and is able to create new decks to win. Capability of learning is really just that you can learn what each card does but he applies that knowledge in a way that makes him smart
I’m absolutely loving this podcast💙
Imagine if Ryan got a twitch and gamed... 





my life would then be complete
I was there for that NLSS Hafu
I think that smartness is : how well you can utilize a given information for your own benefit for the long run. Btw another great video!! And who ever read this have a great day 👍
One example of a channel hopper 
ME im subscribed to 150 people
Your podcasts are really interesting, ecpesially this hearthstone theme! :D

I'm so happy you got Dog I live that handsome boi lol Twitch chat knows
I really enjoyed this podcast! please have them back again! <3
I've never watched streaming channels, but itsHafu seems so likable, the way she talks and how cheerful and honest she is reminds me a lot of an ex classmate that I've always admired a lot
I was going to skip this ep bc i dont care about games nor did i know who these people are, but im glad i stayed. They really ended up discussing super interesting stuff. Both seem like cool, smart people :) 

Also, paco grows more and more on me the more i watch the podcasts! Hes so odd and yet hes so insightful when he gets serious. He honestly makes the podcasts sooo much better and interesting! 

Im loving these, so glad theyre doing them regularly ❤ love you ryan and rhpc!!!!
quality podcast again. you go ryan! doing what you love and shit :))   also, I think a lot of people would enjoy seeing the creating process, with or without explanations :3
lol~ a lazy extrovert!!!


I guess i'm a lazy extrovert then :D She just described me perfectly!!
I freaking LIVE for your podcasts. Favorite vids :)
odd contraction of muscles but affirmative, but also i’m laughing hysterically cuz this podcast is so good every time!
When I saw Dogdog in the title, I thought it was gonna be Marley
YES NOW I CAN LISTEN TO MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBER ON SPOTIFY!
48:20 I ACTUALLY REALLY WANT TO SEE IT!! I want to see what goes in that genius mind of Ryan's
I love every bit of this podcast <3 makes me productive while editing my videos.
Dear Ryan, Can you prove that you are Ryan
I never knew the day would come when hearthstone is finally featured in Ryan higa's video
(NOT RELATED TO THE VIDEO) CAN WE HAVE A AGENTS OF SECRET STUFF PART 2TWO ARDEN CHO AND RYAN HIGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please invite Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco. He also has ADHD since his childhood and it would be fun if he will be also off the pill or off the weed..
left brain and right brain is a common misconception. you actually use different parts from the right and left at the same time. So basing your personality on that isn't true.
This is like two of my worlds colliding. HANG OUT MORE PLEASE!
Love your vids man
Im really loving these podcasts
please keep such podcasts coming ryan <3
Why don't you upload to Google podcasts anymore?
Damn.. this podcast is old. It was shot in December 2nd week based on the hearthstone expansion timeline they mentioned. But two of my favorite things in one video. Hearthstone and Ryan 💓
Our teacher just told our class:
"I don't care if you are good in your own way, I am not following you. If you want me to think you are good, you have to be good in what I am good at."
Ryan needs to put more slack at the end of his XLR Cable where it connects to the mic.  There is going to be a short in the wires soon.  @nigahiga  That will cure my depreSean.
Ryan x HS streamers, well this is a weird combination. Not that I complain.
Will is my fav wish he talked more
Fairy tale was legit only good for like the first 3 seasons
it just turned into a repetitive fan service drama
Ryan released a video... Quick think of something original that'll get a heart....




 First
David is SunlessKhan's voice-brother
That million dollar dice question really reminded me of the WEBTOON dice 😮
fairy tail haha.. it isn't the only one with that idea... many isekai anime has the "quest" mechanic such as goblin slayer :)
The best stream on Twitch is Critical Role!
I'm glad you're doing something you like doing xD
Do a podcast wif the what's good podcast
Meme review *clap*clap👏
While they talk about having the stream in the background, I have this podcast in the background while I'm gaming. Lol
Wait Ryan, you can't mention Myers Briggs and not tell us your type!!
Higa got waves
Dear Ryan, do a YouTube ReRyan 2018

Probably too late already
I haven't fully watched the previous podcasts lmaoo gonna binge watch if i got time
Dear Ryan,
Can u do the naruto mirror run challenge with all of the RHPC members? (I think this is not actually intentionally made)
Would be cool to do a podcast with Greg & Daina - the dynamic of working so closely with their partner - how do they balance work & their relationship ?
Dear Ryan, can you tell us the story of how you met each RHPC member?
Aww.. they didn’t put in the “Shi Shi Break” commercial 

I want it back Dx
Keep doing with these podcast,I love it guys 👍🏾
do more where's will tho plz
Dear Ryan, could you say “Dear Ryan” 1000 times? 😀👍
Dear ryan, Can you do a when the music video doesn't match the song?
15:32 - looks back from the dishes I’m watching...

ME TOOOO!!!! <3 hahaha
For anyone 21 or older, take a shot for everyone time each person says *dumb*, good luck
Ryan please stand up for our friends in European nations on the verge of Article 13.
Dear Ryan,
Hanate
R-dizzle
Regina
Ryan

Why is Hanate the only one without an R?
I think the real question is, ‘How do our perceptions of intelligence merge with our objective measures of intelligence (such as our IQ test), which itself is influenced by our perceptions?’

Yeah… now I’m wondering whether the word smart has any real meaning. Do any words have any real meaning since they’re so affected by our perceptions of them?
wann just looked up my birthday on famous birthday and found that mine is the same as Sean's.... i miss him
Ryan, you should watch Stephen Crowder.
I paint 🎨 🖼 while I listen 👂. Anther good conversation on the topics brought.... what’s smart? What’s dumb? 🤔 conveying level?
remember old youtube with kevjumba and jeremy lin in the videos
love your podcasts :D~
15:39 im actually actively watching😂 just sittin on the balcony enjoying life, listenin to the best podcast i know
I really love these podcast bro!

Thanks for the transition to podcast!!
Skitzo podcast
Woah, consistent upload
....
This podcast got me thinkin
Sure cute asian girl, people watch you for the skillz at the game haha
the bobbleheads in the background make this creepily good.
I thought I'm early but there are already 300 comments on this. The power of Ryan Higa.
Get Arden Cho on the podcast
Please make a video about the process of making a video :)
Dogdog realised that not everything should be about work on his own while Superwomen needed a therapist to realise it (in other words spend SOOOOOO much money for common sense) :') but as long as it helps her then I'm happy for her :) LOVE Ryan's podcasts :D Hope he gets a sponsor soon!!!
MTG Arena>Hearthstone.
Ryan should have PewDiePie on his podcast...just sayin
Dead Ryan, can you do a fake movie trailer of “Granny” from Roblox. Pr-teehee-y please!!
as a person with ADHD I'd love to see the work being shown
Could you please make a New video of the "how to be (nerd, ninja, gangster, emo)" serie. I have been whatching you ever scince. It would be nice
I wanna see a podcast with Marley. I feel like he has A LOT of great ideas he wants to share with everyone.
RYAN, YOU ARE MY BACKGROUND NOISE. Thanks for keeping me alive during my work session T.T
0:23 The topic about "donating" in that preview, I think I didn't hear it in the actual podcast. Did RHPC cut it out?
Have MrBeast as guest please I would like to see him clap with you 👏
first time anyone mentioned fairy tail im a big fan no one else is :D 


Great podcast as always!
I was too late to this vid to get hearted
Oh well 
Rip streak
Ryan, we NEED a skitzo podcast!!!!
I love this episode. I liked the question/conversation about debating on what is a dumb person. Also please do a video of your boring/odd way of creating a video.
Listening Ryan random talk feels really good for some reason 😂
this was my background noise
Dear Ryan, Can You Host Meme👏Review👏?
This is my least favorite podcast so far out of the 4 but it is still good keep them up everyone enjoys them !!
I feel like I need to drop some thoughts about audial\visual\kinesthetic stuff.

It's commonly considerable as everyone has their primary channel of perception, and that's what defines them, but it's actually not. In fact, it highly depends on the essence of what you're doing and how you interact with the world right now. You can be visual when you watch some manuals or read signs outdoors, audial when you're listening to the books or simply music, or kinesthetic when you walk into a dark room.

I could be wrong, but the reason why you guys consider yourselves as a visuals might be just because the world around you highly demands your eyes to see and watch. And it's totally understandable since we get the majority of information by our visual channel. But you also need ears and touches to get the remaining minority, which is not minority in special occasions.

P.S. I'm sorry for that English since I'm Russian and English is not my mother tongue, but I hope it's understandable somehow.
I have had this conversation before and settled on intelligence being adaptability and learning. It's not about knowing all the right answers, but being able to solve the puzzle. imo
I would love to see Shroud on one of your podcasts :D
Guys i love this podcast sooooo much so please continue the great work
Off the Pill Podcasts should be live streamed so Ryan could talk to the viewers as well.
Dear Ryan,

Can you do how to be a gamer...
I love how she was talking about Mr. Beast but didnt know it
4:45 Now I'm thinking about Jacksepticeye 😂😂
20:12 but why r you playing dota chess more than hearthstone now hafu Kappa
a good, similar question, often asked to athletes is: you would win the olimpics, but in 5 years you die. would you accept? most athlets would, so would i
I used to click anything from nigahiga right away, now there's a podcast to dismiss...
This means I might miss your regular video's.

I've seen more youtubers dump their podcast on youtube, that usually doesn't go too well. I know you don't see too many negative comments or dislikes, but just compare the viewcount here vs the 'dear ryan' video's for example.

I wouldn't like to see your channel decline because you mixed content with different audiences on a single channel, I've seen this happen to other channels.
(Tough I can't remember any examples from the top of my head)
Dear Ryan 
Can you host Meme Review?
I agree with Hafu, it would be interesting to see your process of writing a script and creating a video.
I was just thinking to myself, "I bet people are going to complain he's doing these podcasts and not the other stuff", then that topic was brought up
I'm here for the possible NLSS mention
Hearthstone and Ryan? This is gonna be amazing
So hyped that hafu and dog were on, luv them both <3
the best episode so far, with people I love :)
This is one of my favorite things. Never stop this podcast.
I LOOKED Up so fast when Ryan said Fairy Tail
And Will’s presence is so damn good but i also missed paco
oh boy oh boy i knew this podcast was a great idea!
Alle the dislikes are from australians.
They’re just upside down
Love these podcasts!! Keep em
Up. I would love to see you discuss things that make you go out of your comfort zone. For example in the beawcast with jkfilm, they are soooo honest and blunt, it’s wonderful bc they talk about stuff we all think about , but don’t say out loud. Would love to see that from you.
Dear Ryan, can you do a podcast with Arden Cho? Love her!!! 💕
41:49 Bring back Cooking, but not really!
Iq tests are most accurate when taken very young at around 2-3. This is the age where kids are aware of their surroundings but unable to study. iq basically measures their cleverness and ability to solve problems naturally.
Ryan, can you do an episode with Wongfu production? That'd be cool!!
Yo bring the merrell twins in this podcast
i love these podcasts so much!!
This was great. I’ve been having memory issues lately so this was somewhat calming to watch for some reason, thank you
dear ryan can you do new BgA song
Ryan I really love you! I think these days you are posting videos and making videos that you really wanna do! I appreciate that so much and I'll support you every time and everyday-! Luv ya!!
I loved them! Also, I think you should’ve asked so much more than you did Ryan. Still enjoyed it though.
its Top autochess players on twitch
Personally I separate how smart someone is by 4 parts. Wisdom (as in reference to common sense), intelligence (standard IQ and ability to learn and analyze/ comprehend), knowledge, and creativity.
the only twitch streamer I know is a guy called Will and he goes by the name of yellowpaco ^^ ;)
Ryan can you play cricket with your friend.
Ryan you gotta do your part and fight for the Sub War! Help Felix!
im the exact opposite when I watch streams, I watch for the person and not the game/content
15:30 me right now, listening to nigahiga's podcast as background noise as i draw 😅
@nigahiga, please make "OFF THE PILL" it's own CHANNEL, for those who don't want to watch it
@nigahiga, please make "OFF THE PILL" it's own CHANNEL, for those who don't want to watch it
Oh, and I would also love to see some of your "undumbed" stuff, just out of curiosity :-)
HyperX should hit em up with a sponsorship
32:14 Did he drink Hafu‘s Coffee? 😅😅
Anyone listens to podcasts while editing.
Don’t worry Ryan, people like me love your podcast
You should probably give them a chance to tell the audience where they can find them like at the end of Hot Ones 🔥😂
My favourite hearthstone streamer and my favourite youtuber :D
This was amazing since I watch you and watch hafu and dog sooo it was like a clash of worlds! I loved it
Please bring back conspiracy theories video
We need your help, Ryan..
Please do your part,
SAVE PEWDIEPIE!!
- a 9yr old
Great seeing 2 big parts of my childhood coming together :) Love hafu, dog, and ryan!
I love the podcasts. Keep them coming
I watch dog because he is insane at the game and his music playlist is really really good
been waiting for this LOL 😂
Just realized... that you all taped the logo Hx for all of your headsets :D Now I just cannot unsee it... Just want you know (;
Your podcasts are actually the best. Love it
Ryan, you're thinking of intelligence vs wisdom.
This is so cool!! Me liking this podcast idea. Looking forward to the next guests...
Kev jumba pleaseeee!!!!!!!!
The bags under everybody's eyes are honestly concerning. Get some sleep, we'll be here waiting for you to come back
Dear Ryan, you should do a conspiracy about the Bermuda Triangle and the Dragon’s Triangle
Hey ryan




Higa teehee
PLZZZZZZ KEEEP MAKING THESE PODCAST i did a days worth of chores just listening to your conversation
I had no idea with streamers. I mean not that it seems simple, but it’s a lot harder than it is. I learned a lot from this. 😳
From Ryan's NLSS to Ryan's Off The Pill Podcast. Hafu's really hitting it off
I this my first favorite podcast my second is the rt podcasts
Dude I love this podcast so much please do more
Yoir podcast is hurting your channel
Next Podcast : Arden Cho. It’s gonna be epic. 😅😅
Dear Ryan
Can you do a parody of Wes Craven's "A nightmare on elm street"?
Dear Ryan, I dare you to watch videos of a KPOP group called BTOB
Dear Ryan,
make a parody of the uncle sam army poster and make it so that he says, 
"I want YOU to sub to pewds"
I think smart is not only being able to pick up and understand stuff but being able to develop new ideas or thoughts based on the things you learned. Some kind of progress and added value should be achieved by a person with that kind of intelligence. ( which is a better word than smart imo)
Who else wants to see a video of Ryan's creative orocess?
I guess Hafu found a better Ryan.
Damn I love these podcasts I'm Hella sick just bringing these
My mom asked what I was watching and I said my niga higa. I later got grounded. Thank you Ryan.
Dear Ryan, Can you do some of the challenges in tiktok? (Like the naruto running in mirror)
You are best my friend
I wish Ryan would’ve said what his Myers Briggs personality type is. My guess is that he is either an INTP or an ENTP. I’m an INFJ
GG'S in the chat
If you press this button twice really fast it will turn grey 
👇
I really want to watch the podcast on Spotify while doing other stuff but I feel like I miss so much when I miss the claps at the beginning and the hand gestures and facial movements
Make a Higa Podcast channel
37:31
Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
I hope your knee gets soon
Guys: A smart person is the one that can apply the right action at the right moment.
Good its what is on its place. Bad its what is out of its place
Laughing its fun, but out of the place becomes a problem...
Water is good in a glass, but  looding the house its a problem..
You get me... i hope
You should collab with the Try Guys
DEAR RYAN, CAN YOU GET TIK TOK FAMOUS???????
I love the podcasts but you gotta come up with a better outro... because that sounds creepy
I just want this series to never stop,
We are definitely progressing as humans: "Never boiled water. "  ..nevermind. lol. Isnt hearthstone already becoming irrelevant? I know it has to me and I use to be obsessed with it and with watching streamers like amaz and trump.
Guys it was just Hafu and Ryan talking and then Will says something and I'm like what he is also here????
Man these podcasts are really good for studying
So I was playing the piano while listening to this podcast and the SECOND I started playing the Fairy Tail theme song, Ryan said: "So have you ever seen Fairy Tail?" and I was like oh sHiT wOw SuGoI pSyChIc RyAn
LET'S GO! They got E-Sport legend Hofu on!
Try Where's Will Tho again

You might like it
My thinking aligns so well with her, I like her. She’s so logical and level headed considering she also spends all her time inside her house.
When will BGA comeback?
There are so many twitch streamers now that I feel like it is almost impossible to grow your stream organically...
Ryan’s videos are getting out really fast lately!
(Dear Ryan) Try Sneak Attack the RHPC Squad with the green ball
Dear Ryan ,
Could you please invite Rich Brian ? Thank you, hv a great day
Could you upload this to Spotify please. You leave me stranded.
Dude I like the podcast keep doing you
Like when you see comments of Ryan and think of our lord and savior the egg head.




God I hope Hafu makes a NLSS plug
You have to have a little bit of money to stream. I'd love to stream and make content but I don't have the money to invest since it really is an investment. 
Good gaming PC to stream/record high-quality content is a huge investment on the PC alone. Not to mention Mic and most top streamers use a camera. Personally, I'd do youtube over streaming but it would be a fun thing to do as I like interaction. 
"Anyone" can do it, but you need some kind of start..
Plz do another cooking but not really or I dare youuuu
Once again you made my morning commute entertaining! Loving this content a lot and already waiting for the next podcast!!
I am EXTREMELY interested in how Ryan writes for his videos. As someone with ADHD who can relate to his statements on learning differently and difficulty with reading comprehension, I would absolutely love to see how his writing process works. PLEASE SHOW US! (Reference to 47:48)
Can you do a podcast where everyone stares at each other and says nothing for an hour?
It's entertaining to just watch Ryan talk. These podcasts are awesome.
(Not my idea but commenting again so Ryan sees it)
Do a podcast with all skitzo members!
How is Ardon Cho? Huh Ryan😂
Ryan can you do  ( nice guy 2)or else I will eat your dog ‘,;)
i dont enjoy hearthstone but i enjoy this podcast
i'd roll that dice for $5
dear Ryan,
could you please make a conspiracy video about cicada 3301
dear ryan , since the winter is comming could you make make a video on " how to sound like you faviourate GOT character"
Deer ryan, can you try to create a hand crafted slingshot
(I am currently making one)
DO YOUR PART!!! only 9000 subs ahead
I'd really like to see a comedian on here, like maybe Lonely Island or an indian stand up comedian like Biswa, Kenny, Vir Das etc.
BgA MORE SONGS
i only know hafu from NLSS and i put the video on without looking at the tittle or anything then i turn around and hear hafu's voice and i am like wait a sec did i leave a video/stream replay playing in the backround
Dear Ryan you should different types of anime characters
Lowkey sounds like mei
Wow Dog aka rurururururururu and ms. "12-0" xD
Exchange of subscriptions
Dear Ryan,
Can you travel all the way to the uk to step one foot in the country and then leave
Put these podcast on SoundCloud or Spotify so I can listen in class!!!
Man Ryan's not getting views on these long podcasts well we'll have to see how his style evolves
Notification gang where u at?
Hafu's so pretty!
I just wanted to say regarding the topic of intelligence, that many people assume it comes from school or grades, but in reality, there are MANY different types of intelligence! Just because someone gets Straight A's, does not solely dictate they are smart. If they cannot apply that knowledge in the real world, it becomes useless. Those of you who suck at school, please keep in mind that it does mean you aren't smart!  Practice makes perfect! :3

Side note: Paco may be silly and hyper, but he is pretty wise. At least what I've seen from his Youtube videos.
I feel sad for them honestly. I guess they’re happy but sitting in front of the computer multiple hours everyday and never leaving your house sounds really depressing to me.
Dear Ryan can you do a video with jacks film
I kinda want to see Ryan and bo burnham do a podcast together but I don't think their personalities would match
i saw this on my recommended after watching kripp. I approve
Wow first podcast with 4 people and first podcast with a returning person!
Dear Ryan, can u make a video saying nigahiga 1,000 times
lol if you like Pokémon and people who rage at videogames, you should watch @MandJTV. he's great and mainly streams on youtube nowadays.
#1 Hearthstone Player in N. America? Not even close, Kripp is the King. King Lettuce for everything.
I know feel dumber than usual
Dear Ryan, can you tell us the story❤❤❤
I rolled a 3, anyone else?
I like how he blocked off the HyperX logo
Hearthstone podcast! Lets go.
Hi Ryan!

Love your consistency now!
I really liked the discussion on the difference between being smart and knowledgeable and to me, being knowledgeable is knowing a lot of information but being smart requires you to know HOW to use that information.
dear ryan can you play the movie bird box?
Just a reminder that this was a thing
(ryan and sean's not so excellent adventure) look it up
Ho Ryan! You fricka lol love your podcast brah! Funny enough I watch dog and Hafu too, so I really enjoyed this one. The fawkin outro had me dying. I’m glad to have witnessed your success since the hanabadah days, much aloha from all your bradahs back home
After watching this I was like, this girl streams for 15 hours??? I look up her twitch and she is not there...
TOP HEARTHSTONE PLAYERS??!!! WHERE TF IS DISGUISEDTOAST
hearing ryan say he keeps up an act during his vlogs is a little lame.
I absolutely love this podcast series. I can't wait to see more and more of these.
Ryan, do you know what happend to actor justin min?
Ellen page posted picture her instagram her new tv show cast from Umbrella Academy.
But she was purposely excluded asian actor justin min in her instagram photo.
And also umbrella academy official instagram did that too.
I hope you talk about this issue in your podcast. I wanna hear your opinion about this issue.
I love you so much from south korea.
Hafu and Dog <3
9:32 just wanna clarify for any college students that finishing late is NOT a bad thing.  It doesn't say anything about your abilities or knowledge, each person's situation is different.  I'm currently on track to finish a semester late, but there's nothing wrong with that.  <3
When was it filmed? Dog haven’t played hs for days at least on stream
Who else is conditioned to hear Meme Review after the clapping? Your channel inspired me to start my own
ryan has been stuck on 21 mil subs for the last wo years why is he growing so slowly
I don't give an F about HS but I love watching TOAST play it or any other game he's just funny.
I just realised DO APEX LEGENDS THE MOVIE OFFICIAL FAKE TRAILER
Finally,  a girl!😁
dear Ryan, Can you sing a Bengali song?{in your style}
We need Kevin on this podcast
Dear Ryan, for the next podcast, can you talk about supernatural instances that you coudn't explain? I know you have done this before but it was so interesting!
Dear Ryan, can you host meme review?
15:30 lol literally doing makeup while this is in the background
Great to hear NLSS reach this far out of their bubble.
Happy for the egg lord
Loving the podcast
I'm acrtivly watching at this moment. 15:53
Don’t need to dumb it down for those English classes lol. They analyze everything...
38:22

There is a theory called the Multiple Intelligences Theory by Howard Gardener.

All of us have at least one of the following intelligences:
Musical-rhythmic and harmonic.

Visual-spatial.

Verbal-linguistic.

Logical-mathematical.

Bodily-kinesthetic.

Interpersonal.

Intrapersonal.

Naturalistic.

So basically, all of us are smart in our own ways.
He said he wasn’t good at cooking.... Cooking but not really again confirmed?
Super interesting and entertaining. I always look forward for the next podcast. Cant wait for the first commercial shishi? break
When I first started playing WoW...I asked a billion questions..game is super confusing at first if no real knowledge about it
Hi random person scrolling through the comments
Best podcast series hands down , make wanna grab a sleeve that there isn’t a ikea sponsee yet
Lol using this as background noise xD
We want to see you video creation process!!
Well I mean, generally intelligence (IQ) is measured by how quickly you're able to pick up patterns. Basically, how quickly you learn. Of course you can gather a lot of knowledge, but that doesn't mean you understand that knowledge and can make conclusions based on what you've studied. That's where IQ comes in.
talking about hearthstone and you don’t even have DisguisedToast
Tfti man I am a top Hearthstone Player too who dabbles in a bit of streaming XD. Got the young 3 viewers Me, my dad, and usually a random dude. As for streaming being an act I think that is a good question cause sometimes its like SUPER obvious (or you really hope its an act...) but I like people that seem to be natural like imaqtpie, that is what I aspire to be streaming wise because I like how chill and natural he seems.
39:58 SEAN!!
For painfull death vs infinite money, I'd roll a 1/6
i love the podcasts!!!
That intelligence question is SO good!
Ryan, can u have Arden Cho on this Podcast please.
seeing Shroud mad is like a rare moment
I clicked so fastttt
yet there is already 101 comments wow lol
This podcast grabs so many sleeves.
Could you do another escape room video
I think IQ is a measure of being adaptable. There's a difference between having skill in something specific, and being able to be...maybe above average across multiple situations. If you're able to apply the things you've learned in different contexts, I think that's smart/intelligent/high IQ, whatever, etc.
I wanna see Ryan's video making process!
I’m so happy that you did this series 😊
I really wanna see how Ryan works and his work flow etc it’ll be interesting
do a conspiracy theory video about chuck e cheesed
Really enjoy Ryans podcasts they just talk about whatever comes to mind and goes off from there
I need conversation with regina and the other
Never clicked on a video so fast....!
You should invite DisguisedToast and Poki next, they are streamers too but they aim to be pro entertainments.
fyi 40:07 that's why you always do IQ tests on kids, right after they are big enough to understand the questions but too young to study for it
My mind is blown, I’m left handed and of course I write with my left hand as well as hold utensils with it too but everything physical I do with the right like throwing a ball. I didn’t know if others are like that as well
People dress of what they miss.
People are incomplete... so they need to find a way to complete themselves
Bring shroud in the next poadcast
Now I need a video with Ryan's notes and stuff
Love off the pill... but dont love gaming. see you next episode.
Ryan should get a fan on the show
Is the red shirt guy imposting his voice... I kinda bet on that man. He speaks from the throath.....
Dear Ryan,Can you make a new escape room 2
Hafu from Ryans show on Ryans podcast.
HAFU AND DAVID??? 😍
Wtf this is like 2 of my worlds colliding
really enjoyed this guys! have really enjoyed hafu for such a long time
You should get more twitch streamers. Very interesting people
Wait! Why no one asked what's Ryans personality type?! I can't be the only one who wants to know 😅
59 views 159 likes. Hmmmmm YouTube did an oopsie
I'm actually really enjoying these. It's kind of surprising.
i sometimes actively watch.. the podcast.. giving my full attention.. is that bad
love listening to these off the pill podcasts
Can you do the “Naruto Mirror Run Challenge?”
Omfg these are so hilarious! I love these podcasts but deep in my heart I slightly miss his old vids
Is it just me or is it that Hafu blinks a ton especially when she’s not talk when David is talking hafu blinks a ton
Hey Ryan why don’t you make your own conspiracy theories video
The real meaning of dumb is, when someone is unable to speak.
I appreciate the shoutout to the NLSS!
I am first but I’m not gonna say it






First
AYYY Soylent is a berkeley startup
We need Ryan's help to save pewdiepie guys. Please do ur part Ryan
the Introvert/extrovert in the personality test refers to where the person gets their idea from not the Introvert/extrovert people are talking about
i need a shirt with will saying GET EM on it
i feel like ryan used to be really popular but a lot of his audience kind of just left. its sad but i hope all is well. ive been here for 4 years im gonna stay
Next time have dog take his shirt off Kappa
I'd love to see the process of planning a video! Getting an inside look at Ryans mind
I WANNA SEE HOW THIS GENIUS COMES UP WITH HIS VIDEOS
this was such a successful pick for the crew, very interesting discussion!
One visit from Sean and ryan is happy again
16:10 you are describing me right now!
Dear Ryan, can you do something that you are good but also bad at the same thing ?, at the same time
ryan! can you do another one but this time with the og guys like tim and taryyn?
Bring ksi on to the podcast
Off the pill podcast: Like

Impaulsive podcast: Reply
Make an off the pill channel
It's crazy because, studies have shown the more "right-brained" or, more "left-brained" person epidemic doesn't exist. I did a research project on it, it is a myth.
I think being 'smart' and being 'intelligent' are two completely different things. Intelligence I see as your book smarts. How well you score on tests, how well you absorb information, etc. Being smart in my opinion is the ability to make the right decisions at the right time. Is someone that gets straight A's still smart if they start crack cocaine and raping women?
thought this was pretty new but the latest HS expansion was like 3 months ago, they said about 1 week :P
Oh damn this is a crossover I didn't expect but love
ryan can you do your part in thecwar against t series?
Dear Ryan can you do a game of clash royal where you are the cards like in Jumaji Welcome to The Jungle
To answer your questions about intelligence, look up the eight intelligences.
I’m selling timestamps for likes!!!

0:00
6:39
I dare you to get slapped in the face from everybody in the room 3.5
Yoooo Hafu when. Great to see them here.
Its so sad how the views in ryans videos went down. Eventhough he already made its clear that it doesnt matter. I'll still support you no matter what. To the youtuber who made me love youtube. ❤❤
They clearly don't watch Twitch lol.
Sometimes you gotta like your own comment just to get the ball rolling
i wanna see a video about Ryan's creative process
I'm a neuroscience and philosophy student and I just want to tell you all that there are no such thing as "right brained" or "left brained".. 
On another note, intelligence is very hard to define philosophically and I'm happy that you go into such subjects! 😄
I think intelligence is more about learning and having the ability to retain that information. Being able to successfully communicate yourself to others is also a part of it. Because there are plenty of people out there who go and major in something and they end up knowing only that field but clueless about every other thing in life. Met so many people like that. You need common sense mixed with the ability to retain multiples of information but then actually acting on it. There could be a lot of genuinely intelligent people out there that never apply those abilities.
17:34 when the girl speaks while laughing, sounds so chineese :D
99% of people won't read this, but





1% HAVE A NICE DAY FULL OF GOOD LUCK, LOVE & PLEASURE
LOVE & BLESSING 💞 FROM A YOUTUBER PRODUCING RELAXING MUSIC & SOOTHING SOUNDS
I literally learn more about life in this podcast than school
I love these but make another channel for this
I can relate to Paco. I am quite an intellectual but not everyone can match my itellect so I lower myself just to enjoy life. I like to call myself "Situational" everything about me changes due to everything around me.
I knew they were talking about summit the second the video started
It's a shame that Ryan has lost 20k+ subs since he has started the off the pill podcast
Can you do fails trick shot 😂
Back round noise literally me rn
I believe there is more than one intelligence, but most people compare intelligence to book smart. We excel in different aspects and skills in our lives and lack in others. Also, i think conveying intelligence and having a certain intelligence are two different things. To convey means that you have to be good at performing, communicating and articulating which can be different from the whatever you are trying to explain or show. So, I think someone can be good at something, but if that skill isn't something based on performance outcome, it isn't fair to say that they don't have that skill
This episode reinforced why I love philosophy
youtube is drunk again
I want to see Ryan's thought process!
I don't know... Hafu really does seem like an introvert to me. I am an introvert who loves people. Thing is, I get exhausted if I'm around people for a few hours, and I mean it. I will barely have the required energy to sit. I've passed out because of it before. It's insane.
I love this podcast
Are you book smart, street smart, or both?
HEY who thinks "OFF THE PILL" should be it's OWN CHANNEL
Hafu hasn't boiled water
I wanna see it (how rayan comes up with ideas)
Fairy tail fans here?
Dear Ryan can u make group steryotypes
Why does it come out like 4 hours early on podcasts
SKITZO PODCAST!!!!!
Shout out pewdiepie
You should bring Arden on!
I got a Hennessy add during shi shi break
heyy I know that probably ńobody will read this but for the person whó reading this, ít will really màke my Day!👍Have Successful life and I wish you the best of luck ìn the future.❤️🍌! I know fàme doesn’t happen ovèr night but Im trying my bést to reach 10,000 suubs! I make all sorts of funny/Meme video,check it out!Wish me the best of Luck and hàve a goòd day!!
I was really hooked.
I think being smart is understanding, being able to really understand math instead of knowing how to solve a problem. To understand what someone is feeling and what they need instead of learning what to say and do.
Dear Ryan please do boruto Naruto the movie trailer
heeey it's dog and hafu!
How about studying for a blood test
I forgot will was there
Tried a singing carrier heh BgA
Will is leftieee 😍
I thought I saw onision in the thumbnail 💀
The latest Hearthstone expansion has been out for over 2 months now, are these podcasts just from a really long time ago? Also, I think "gameplay" isn't the only reason people watch Hafu
Have Daina and Greg on next
What editing software do you use
Hi random person scrolling through the comments :)
Dear Ryan can you do more skitzo??

Dear Ryan, can you make Greg his own little mustache party?
Yo invite Toast he is a og player too
Love the podcasts. When’s the next episode of parkhorse?
Dear Ryan, play fortnite and get the Victory Royale
they talked about tyler XD
I have a friend that got 1300 on the PSAT but he has no common sense. He collects plastic knives and eats nothing but pickles for lunch.
I think how smart you are is defined by how fast you can learn something.
Official podcast.... PLEASE
Dear Ryan can you do parkourse vids again?
they ahould come on again that was fun
League Of Legends > Dota 2
Dear Ryan, Can you prove that Mark Zuckerberg is a lizard?

Dear Ryan can you do a dear skitzo!🙏🙏🙏
1 like=1 agreement

I don't watch twitch, but I've definitely seen or watched her.
I want to see how Ryan makes his videos!
Post a script/notes please! Those would be really cool to see!
Have Arden on the podcast!!!
Can you pretend  to be the side characters of popular anime
I love these podcasts!! and I actually sit and watch and don't do anything else while watching

Great episode guys! Keep up the great work
why so low views?
Hmmm can’t turn the notification bell on for some reason... not sure when it got turned off, but I’m glad the podcasts popped up in my suggestions box!
Can u do rubber band trick shots
Man that's so sad, hardly ever leave the house.
h3 called. They want their podcast back.
Dear ryan can you do parkour with out moving
Can you do bottle flip
doing dishes and listening to podcast
Ryan: i think people listen to it doing things

Make a death metal solo in cardboard guitar
Bring Arden Cho
Should’ve brought disguised toast
ryan higa, i beg you, please do your part
That's what my friend said to me on fortnite and that's when I became god but I have played fortnite for around six months now
I honestly didn’t expect you to know Dog and Hafu! I casually watch them when they are streaming, so it’s cool that they appeared on this podcast! :D
IQ tests can't easily be studied for. the questions are more abstract and continue to get more difficult so you just eventually can't do them anymore.
she sounds like vanessa hudgens a bit
When ryan says your favourite anime is repetitive😥😥
48:20
I WANT TO SEE IT
I find it interesting that ryan says fairy tail is repetitive but he is a huge fan of Naruto which is pretty repetitive also xD
Make a "behind the scripts" video!
Smartness and dumbness are imprecise terms

There is intelligent(patter recognition, comprehension) and unintelligent , this is almost purly based off of genetics, you can boost you score on an IQ test by studying a little, but not a lot, you just need to have a better brain, this is hardware of the brain.

And there is knowledgeable(facts, holding information, knowing) and ignorant, it is easier to be more knowledgeable with higher intelligence, but even with low intelligence you can be very knowledgeable, a bear is knowledgeable at fishing, but is unintelligent, this is the software of the brain.

There is no such thing as auditory and visual learning, the more senses you use the more you learn.
Dear Ryan....
Is there ever a chance I'll have an awkward handshake with you one day 😁
39:31 I didn’t sponsor Ryan to mention me
Congrats, you guys are putting out great podcasts
Hello just talking for .... ryan plz make more cooking with other crew
Ryan! Derek’s smile looks like someone trying to smile with half a mouth full of water 😂 you need to try it.
You should make a how to sing like your favorite artists part 3
24:00 - 24:25
U should do podcasts with other youtubers
for a 1 in 20 chance, i would roll with a painful death and a million
I am going to be completely honest. I have something to say about Sean and it comes from the previous episode, but I really want someone on HigaTV to see it. But anyway, Sean puts 3 of my favorite charchter traits I to one person and he rocks it. Smart, funny, and private.
Assuming the death is burning alive and every number from 2 - 100 is a million dollars I would definitely roll.

My reasoning is that my chances of a painful death over success IN REAL LIFE are worse than this stupid dice. I have a much harsher ratio, like 1 /25 or 1/10 or worse to die a painful death and there are more options for death and more chances to die. where as the chance of success despite that risk is demonstrably small. Of COURSE I would roll the die. My chances with this die are better than in real life!
Ryan make a video on fortnite
Yes do a behind the scenes of coming up with a video
Get people from offline tv, toast specially, maybe poki and scarra too!
In Colombia (Southamerica) we say Chi Chi. Like I have Chi Chi.... hehehehhehe
Bout to finish this while I do homework...
Dear Ryan can do a rap battle against R-dizzle
I think being smart is being able to understand concepts and apply them to different situations. Like in math class when you learn a concept and then are able to make inferences of what’s gonna happen next
Make more Ryan tries like making a flying toilet
She mentioned WarFrame and I was Instantly Interested!
it's interesting how he changes things up
get em’
where is parkourse 13 ryan i really want to see it
Imagine the misfits come on this podcast
Have anyone notice that you need N-word pass to say nigahiga?
Now this is epic.
This podcast is great
Dead Ryan, can you do the Naruto challenge :D
microwaving water technically is boiling it
Dear Ryan, dan you make idolchallenge
dear ryan can u make a video with jay park again
More skitzo
I don’t know if I’m the only one, but I really like the podcasts in the backroads while playing something or reading
smart for me is basically how someone process information.. knowledge is how much someone have gain information..
Dear Ryan, do Naruto Mirror Run Challenge
I think kanye just has low conversational agility and fluidity. so maybe he has a low communicational intelligence, vocal real time communication specifically, since his music (lyrics) is so detailed and eloquent that its really hard to believe it comes from the same slavery is a choice man. inteilligence is too broad a term to describe in blanket terms. humans have such a wide variety of skills that are all useful but too vast to mastered all in one lifetime, hence why tribe roles existed to alocate people to work based on their strengths. so intelligence is too hard to describe collectively without compartmentalizing different aspects of intelligence.
Ik that u want to do podcasts but will u still do ur comedy videos?
Dear Ryan, please do the seven deadly sins impressions
With the 1 in 100 for infinite money i did a random number generator just to see and it landed on the number i chose first time

Dear Ryan, do a "Mad Lib Theater."
I want to see you make a video
Hearthstone lul, hard game, you need to be smart, it's just so deep
IQ = (mental age/real age)*10
I TOTALLY wanna see a video on the process on making a video. It doesn't have to be funny or anything like that, but it's interesting! You have such a special style and way of thinking that it really is something I think a lot of people would be interested in deep diving in for a bit.
Dear Ryan can you fly a helicopter?
Play the one million dollars game. You get one million dollars but there is a catch. For example you get one million dollars, but half of everything you see is hallusinations
Dear ryan if what u learned in school was useful.
I would not be mad if you add two podcast a week
I have watched fairy tail and I also thought about going on missions. I thought that was cool too
Quality Content
Honestly I would like to see his notes
Scooby got waves
There are people who would do a two sided die for the 50 percent chance of 1 million. I for one would do it for a 100 percent chance of death.
Ryan needs to get a hyperX sponsor so he can take off the tape from the headphones :p
You should get Arden in here
My definition of "smart" comes down to problem solving and critical thinking. Assuming the knowledge you have is true, can you use it to problem solve? Can you assess a situation correctly? Can you detect plot holes and flawed logic? Can you determine whether your knowledge is true or not? So long as you are fluent in any one language, these traits can determine your intelligence, even if you have never gone to school a day or read a book in your life.
Dude I wouldn’t mind watching this if he just shortened the time
I want to se the way Ryan comes up with a video

My response to 46:13 smart : ability to learn an apply learnt knowledge to a specific thing or task while knowledge  is just acquiring the fact and not doing anything with it other than regurgitating it

Dear Ryan, can you make a trailer for a movie called "Meme King" ?
I think I officially started playing video games when I was about 10... Harvest Moon, Zelda, and Mario were my CHILDHOOD.
I think with the whole talk on knowledge and intelligence, is that you need to distinguish educated from intelligent (and furthermore to make this more complex; wise). I would say intelligence is the natural ability to 'grasp' something. Now this comes in different things to different people and is furthered by experience in learning things (making this topic more mess). E.G Roanldo is a Genius when it comes to his sport, due his train but also his natural ability. Thus I would say is smart when it come to football (or soccer which you prefer.) However, his natural ability to pick up other skills such as quantum mechanics may not be as high. Therefore, I would say a more intellegent person the who is able to 'grasp' the most different skills most easily. That's just my thoughts.
17:15 EGG
I would love to see d trix and other people from ytf on here like chester see

Ryan, can you start selling your TEEHEE hats again?
I feel that what make a person dumb is there unwillingness to even try
Finally got around to listening to this episode because I don't go on Twitch that much it's is not a topic of interest for me. I really prefer Paco as the moderator. The podcast is much more natural when Paco is the model later. No offense to Will (he has his moments for sure) but Paco just makes the podcast way more listenable
I got a 1 after 34 rolls of a d100
Love the podcast
The ability to communicate your thoughts is itself a skill. Many intelligent persons find it very difficult to do so, but those that find large amounts of public success have mastered it. You can be a genius but no one will know it unless u put the time in to learn how to communicate it.
Ryan should do Twitch
The whole right-left brain hypothesis has been disproven, actually. It has no correlation to your skill set and even your way of learning.
What fans don’t like these podcasts? Real talk.
I ship those two
so happy will is back
Ryan please let the guests finish what they want to say!
Dear Ryan Support T Series

Hell, for infinite money, I'll roll a two-sided dice. It's a rough economy, buddy.
Not to be fake deep, but how does she not know how to boil water. Yet another example of the fails in the American public education system.
What was the font of the text in the thumbnail
Dear ryan can you stay just as amazing as you are right now
You should have a behind the scenes video that starts with the brainstorm phase instead of starting with the filming and then talk through the process/show how you document the notes. Even if you feel it wouldn't make sense, it would be enjoyable to see the creative process you follow to produce your work!
You guys need to get Sean for another video of parkourse!!!!!!!!
It is possible because you are way talented than he ever be
Most teachers tell me that what defines my intelligence is not what I know but what I can communicate that I know. If I know the answer to the most complicated philosophical problem but I can't explain it then I don't really know truly the answer.
We need an episode with Chance
The fact is, Kanye is just that stupid he doesn't realize he is stupid. Dunning Kruger effect in full work. Same goes for his idol Trump.
They don't look like they spend 15 hours everyday playing video games

What is life I wonder, is it just living or is there more?!?!?!?
I think intelligence is simply defined as "can you get what you want out of life". If you can't your not smart enough, if you can your smart.
I don’t know why, but the way she talks, the way she smiles, she got me.
I get headaches too when I'm hungry and can get agitated too, but eating really does give me the fix, can relate hafu
10:07 Deep Vein Thrombosis 🤔
The NLSS is so funny.
Dear Ryan: can you tell every one to sub to pewdipie?
I think the problem with the infinite money is that it causes inflation or causes many people to lose so much money depending on how you spend. Personally I'd not roll. Even with painless and 1mil I wouldn't because I think the grief of the people who like me when I die isn't worth 1mil.
Hafu chan wa kawaii desu ne. Hafu's way of using metacommunication is soo Japanese , if I did not understand English, I would think she is from Japan. And David, too, seems like a nice guy and even though I know nothing about Twitch and streaming and gaming I still enjoyed the talk. But I really had to listen close to them as they don't articulate clearly but kinda filter words through their teeth and lips.
DEAR RYAN DO YOUR PART HELP PEWDSSSS!!!!! dont worry i subbed to you first.

Yo Ryan, are you INTJ by any chance?
If I was David, I would totally troll and make a really shitty deck and edit a video with your deck killing and you can probably use your influence and stats and skills to have other people copy/ follow your strats
I feel like if you have to define if a person is smart or not you gotta look at the person's role/purpose
coz if the person has to act dumb in order to reach a goal, then acting dumb is actually the person being smart.

But then I feel like the concept of smartness is going to change as time passes as well coz now we're all about being real and all and so it might become more like a fluid-y concept -- like the media and the public nowadays tend to reward people who are real and genuine so if you show your most genuine side, be it dumb or smart, ppl will like you. But then later it can also transform into like people acting to look like they're revealing their true selves, being real, when they are just putting another face whom the majority of the world likes in front of the camera, in front of the public, or even just anyone. Maybe even themselves. oohhhh getting deep. so they gotta also deceive themselves into thinking that they are whatever image they want to portray themselves to be, and create a character as how they want themselves to be perceived by everyone. So in this case, is being good at deceiving themselves make them smart, if this is their purpose/goal? Or is it stupid because they risk compromising their mental wellbeing and will gradually lose sanity and it's all in vain? But then what if it doesn't matter whether they lose their minds because in this age we have too many people who are not in their right minds, to a point that it doesn't even matter in life for us to think in the right minds? And that we can just enjoy whatever we can with our power whether it means self-deceit or other stuff, with our brain capacity which is so limiting, but it's still fine coz everyone has this limiting brain capacity anyways and we are just losing our minds in our own different ways at different rates? But what if the whole point for us is to not lose our minds in the crowds that are all losing their minds too quickly? Maybe it's no longer important to educate/for people to even just think, have their own thoughts, and not generate an opinion that isn't original, but just copied from some other people or just a mainstream opinion? What is original? Dont we all generate our ideas based on what we learn, what we see, what we hear, people we meet and talk to? etc etc. too many questions, and irrelevant questions.

haha and I am bad at conveying my ideas as well. I consider myself quite a deep-thinker and once in a while I can successfully convey fully/90% of my "greatest" ideas/thoughts and my friends would be amazed at the things I think; they say it's rare, nobody thinks the things I think too much about. But then there are more questions: am I smart for example now, to write this comment? Because I would look dumb if I say that I am smart? Do the smartest people just be silent and scroll through the comments? But my purpose or what I want to do is to share, so does that not degrade the fact that I might be actually smart because I am capable of thinking deep stuff? Is the ability to think deep or have uncommon thoughts equal to intelligence/smartness? If life's meaning has nothing to do with knowing about things, learning about things, thinking about things, for example, if there is God(I am a christian) and the whole point is just to worship God, then would wasting even just 1min thinking about deep stuff (thinking we're smart but we know nothing compared to God) make us dumb, because the smartest people would know their "purpose" and not even bother to think about deep stuff? If it is actually that they are not capable of thinking deep, but because it matches their purpose which doesn't require them to think deep, that makes them the smartest beings? Or, if so, is this termed "lucky" instead of "smart" ? coz the "smartness" doesn't come from their conscious minds but the "smart act" is passive; they're born with it by not having the ability to think deep, which ironically makes them "smart(in life?)" if their purpose has nothing to do with thinking deep. (that's why i think it all boils down to the PURPOSE,,, then there is more question: WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE? etc. later.) Are some people, who they dont need to pay an effort or do a thing and are naturally born into being "smart in life", lucky? Or are we all able to do that, but it's just that we do not recognise our "true purpose"? What we are meant for?  Does the fact that I think unusual/rare/unique things makes me smart? Do we tend to call things dumb/not smart because they are commonplace? But would it be that in another world/a parallel universe, my most unique unusual thoughts are actually common and ordinary and thus are widely perceived as dumb thoughts?

this is going too far
I appreciate whoever made it this far. thanks for reading and I hope you have a great day and a great life :) (is it dumb/smart to write this last sentence?)
Dear Ryan can you do ten dabs with your legs while doing a handstand
I am a severe member of the predominantly inattentive subgroup of ADJD and I’d want to see the notes and the process that you use to come up with videos to see if it is similar to my nonsensical prewriting process

Apart from streamer's lifestyles, they don't have friends because they don't really interact in real life, apart from online communities? I say this because they spend most of their time, streaming or sleeping, where is there room or time for interaction with others on that level?
Dear Ryan, can you sneeze with your eyes open?

GREAT!! i have all the qualities to be a streamer... except i suck at games and i'm not a very funny person.... heck...

i mean i work from home and my routine is that... sleep, bathroom, computer all day, repeat. add food 2-3 times a day. if i go out is something planned for weeks and i don't use public transport either. also my social life is.... doesn't exist.... should i be a streamer anyway? i do crafts... is that a thing?

and about inteligence, yeah, there are several types of it, i suck at numbers and stuff, in school and college i never had a method to study or something (i don't how the heck i managed to graduate).... but i'm good with my hands and sometimes i mcgiver stuff around hahahaha BUT there are definitely dumb people than can't even understand the most basic things.

Ryan got a sponsor this podcast!
The holy substance has arrived, higallugiah
27:51 OMG I LOVE THAT SHOW
Not dumb but the word you’re looking for is ignorant 

Dumb - can’t be taught/changed 
Ignorant - just doesn’t know
This was another great podcast on your channel Ryan I loving it every step of the way I hope that this shitt keeping flow on the YouTube space . In addition, I love the conversation about how do you measured intellect and recent upload on twitch my guy.I don't think that it was a good product better that the previous entry which was the second on off the pill podcast but it was decent to say the least. To be reiterated my previous point in this comment on intellect I believe that there are different ways people or human can say who is the smarter or dumber in general. I guess that is little dept but not too confusing but the future that we can hope that there're better to say who is smarter base off many study's on different individuals.I love yall and bye😘
Anyone still waiting for reryan
I might be stupid but IQ is how you can grasp something, and there are 2 types of IQ, crystallized IQ is the most important part because is the ability of learn something. So think of it as a box that you can put things in, soo a person with a 200 IQ has a cargo box while a person with a 80 IQ has a picnic basket. But the other IQ is fluid IQ, fluid IQ is how you can solve new problems and identify patterns. I hope that helps in the discussion, you can also argue that IQ cannot change, as in you cannot go from a IQ at 80 to 200. but if you have an IQ of 130 and you are not healthy as IQ degrades if you are not healthy, it can go to 126 IQ. Though if you do cardio your IQ can actually go up. So it's stuck in a certain position like theirs a nail and a rubber band over in, so the band (or your IQ) can only go up and down only to a certain point. This might be all gibberish but i've also think about this a lot so here is my take (:
Jeeze what people dont know directions. They are one crazy driver away from being kidnapped
i really like this
Never boiled water?!?!?! What about pasta????
It's sad the views are declining I bet ryan could acc read all his comments at this point
I like hearthstone! I like Ryan! I like life!
First
Ninja suckz
The thing about girls getting comments about their face when they don't wear makeup or as much of it is mostly because people are used to the face with makeup. Just doing the basics does a huge difference, so I don't think it's strange. It's not so much a girl problem than it is a "people who use makeup"-problem. Girls just happen to use it more often.
Dear ryan make a huge blakent fort
Ryan... we need your help. Please help pewdiepie defeat T-Series... please please please.. you have the power to do so... :(
You should do a live stream off the pill podcast.
You guys should totally have JustJaySama and Heavenly Controller on this podcast
Dear Ryan, I don't think that putting a reference that only few people would understand is a bad thing.
Honestly, there isn't a video on this channel that I don't find funny, creative and intelligent and even if I'm italian and I don't get a lot of references about american culture, somehow I can guess a reference. But even if I don't guess a reference in particular, I don't have to understand completely every part of a video to find it likeable.
Few years ago I read "The Simpsons and Philosophy" and one of the more interesting topics was about the wide range of audience that has the show, because it has a lot of pop culture references, from the "dumbest" one, to the "niche" one.

So, don't dumb down your content, as long as you keep doing fart jokes. :D
LOVE ME SOME HAFU AND DOG
Its good to see some of my favourite Hs streamers! I would love to see offline tv over here
Did anyone esle notice that they taped over the hyperx logo?
well, the best way to prove how intelligent you are is your performance in new situations, so if u put a group of people in a situation and they have no knowledge about it, or previous experiences, the smartest one would be the one who gets out of the situation first, or who just has the best results
Please have Ian and anthony or smosh squad
Ryan expose the notes! 😂
Ryan take your pills!
Oh yeah yeah
Get some of the old YTF guys on the podcast. Dtrix, Chester, Kev, that would be awesome
Kripp should have been here :(
Dear Ryan can you make a  remake of 6ix 9imes stooped

This gets better and better
Do you think people in like poor African villages or someshit would role a 6 sided die, and if it lands on 1 the whole village will have water and food supply for the rest of their lives, and if it rolls on anything else they'd die. Do you think that people of the village would literally be willing to sacrifice themselves to save the village, because it's statistically 6 people needed for that to happen.
What are you people even talking about
Rip disguisedtoast
Nice niners hat Ryan

What's up with these views.

Ryan im going to say TEEHEE on every podcast
Ryan is soooooo smart guys. That question about smarts was perfectly avoided. I've seen behind his plan he does believe hes smarter but he didn't wanna flat out say it. So he avoided it by saying hes dumb so people can underestand him
Hafu is a lazy extrovert , i'm so lazy and an introvert 😢
Do expectation vs reality 2woooooo

If you love these off the pill podcasts comment and tell me what you think of them! :D
You should bring on Logan and KSI

And Logan’s a good choice since he has a podcast he can give advice
I heard the podcast last night.... it was nice today to put faces to the voices!😀👍❤
Love these two streamers :D
NigaHiga, back at it again with a new Podcast. Yooo!
I’ve never seen an episode of off the pill but I saw the thumbnail and just thought “is that dog?”

😍😍😍I love thisss^^ when its 8 pm you have exams tomorrow but there is a new ryan video:)
I listen to this podcast every week
Honestly, these are probably the best videos Ryan has ever put out. They're so entertaining, long and they always have good conversations. The best part about them are that they're also so consistent too.
This was actually a bit sad to listen to ngl. The first half is just them talking about how they literally do nothing all day
Love these!!🤣😃
Dear Ryan can you make a video of what God's life would be like?

I never understood why guys went crazy for girls in video games. Sure, it's not like I didn't care, but to the extent where they'd shower whatever girl returned their attention with gifts, why?
I only watched cos of Sean, to cure my DepreSean
I want Kyle Higa on the podcast
Sean is so chill, Ryan is a good host, Paco is a great storyteller
This series made me realize how smart Paco is

He's bacc!
This is one of the few places on Youtube where there is common sense.
I think we need more paco
I just realized they're the Hawaiian boys of RHPC.
This is a very insightful episode, good job guys (as always).
I never realized this but Paco is actually really got at podcasts. Like he keeps things moving along but he also keeps everything interesting and engages everyone and it's really cool
Dude this is the most I've ever heard Sean talk.
Podcast with Arden Cho please!
Get kevjumba on the podcast and/or Jeremy Lin
Love you Ryan keep up the good work!
TO SEAN: As someone who graduated as a Computer Engineer and works as a Software Developer now, I think it would help you get experience to take on side projects as you're looking. At least with code, they like seeing your own personal projects and coding constantly helps keep us from getting rusty, ya know? If you wanna go into CAD design, do some 3D print builds or something haha.

Also that SKII thing that you did sounded like you helped with some QA (Quality Assurance) testing. You could look into QA jobs which would be less technical / building type stuff but more testing the builds. 

We have this for software development. QAs don't get knees deep into writing code for our end product but they check to make sure we're hitting all requirements. They are pretty technical but just not as technical as a developer. And some QAs even gain enough experience to be able to move onto a development role~ 

Maybe the mech space has something siimlar, if you're down to work a job like that. People who make things always need to have someone there to make sure they did it right so it's a super valuable but not as known role (:
this podcast has really quickly become one of my favorite things to watch & listen to on yt. every episode is always super captivating & interesting as well as really funny 😃
also, i feel like Paco has really proven to be an impressive 'interviewer' & 'conversation moderator' so to speak bc he gets ppl to talk so easily by asking great questions, genuinely listening intently & then responding with his own thoughts & comments. he really helps the conversations flow effortlessly 🙂👌
This series is awesome! I love hearing your opinions and thoughts! Keep it up :D
I'm happy that Ryan is uploading videos very often this year.
This Cured My DepreSean
Dear Ryan, can you do more cooking but not really videos??????
Ryan's Subs are fake man. Give this video more love.
Bring Arden Cho
There are many latinos, you should put spanish subtitles and this way you could get more subscribers, your channel is fantastic! I don't know speak english very well, but I'm practicing with you! It's just a recommendation, many latinos will enjoy your content. 

Saludos desde Colombia♡
probably my favourite episode so far. was a great mixture of light-hearted jokes, insightful opinions and nice flow from topic to topic. glad off the pill is a thing again, love you RHPC & we miss you Sean!! <3
Paco having to turn down his mic 😂
 
who else can relate? 😭
I watch all the ads In ur vids, and I don’t skip them cuz I want u to make more money
Poor sean :( he could use a vacasean
Dear Ryan ,what does nothing look like
"AR" is not "artificial reality" it stands for: augmented reality...yea not a big deal, but it took me a second when he said that
2016 me : "man I wanna be like ryan"


2019 me : "man I wanna be like paco"
YES daina is so under rated !!!! she put so much work on vids with the props and stuff !! LOVE A GIRLPOWER!!
Petition to get Elon musk to hire Sean
I kinda feel bad about it, but hearing Paco is in his first relationship at 27 makes me feel better about being 19 and never having had a girlfriend.
Paco is really good on these podcasts!
Maybe too honest of a comment, but I wasn't expecting to like this video. I kinda was just checking it out mostly just cause I've been following the channel for so long. 
But I really appreciated your guys' honest discussion! It was really refreshing and a very different side of social media. Thanks for this, Ryan and team 😊
I genuinely enjoy your podcasts
Sean is in town
Sean is in town
Everybody’s happy cause
Sean is in town




SEEEAAANNN!
I respect seans decision to do what he wants to do and move away from what i think would be a comfortable position that gradually became uncomfortable. I hope he finds a job and has a great time with his gf
well.. architecture huh.. good luck with thah SEAN <3
Ahhh I really enjoyed this one (: Awesome flow, authenticity in thoughts and showing of personality. Can't wait for the next episode!
Do a video with the old YTF gang. Miss the crew
I really want Ryan to get this podcast sponsored
i need an engineering Job too.
Now I want to meet Dana....lol Put her as a guest on the podcast!!!!!!
tell sean to try Intel in folsom (it's very close to east sac and carmichael)
Dear Ryan, ur looks doesnt changed since 2013,
Pls notice me -Me
Daina, if you are reading this you are beautiful and definitely a 10
If I saw you guys in public is probably just say 
“I’m really happy I got to meet you. I’m a big fan. The first video I ever saw on YouTube was the daily life of Rustin Heiber and I was about 5 or 6. If it’s ok with u, can we get a picture?”
Dear Ryan-

Can I intern with RHPC? 

Much love,
Matt
NigaHiga is just like Smosh...

Long time ago there is only you know.. Sean and Ryan

And Smosh only ian and Anthony 
 But now there is  many people 
Well...  Smosh, Anthony left😓
The camera is way too close to Paco's face
Sean's voice is just so relaxing to listen to
also i'm really glad you guys had that part talking about being more open-minded on politics. it reminded me to be more accepting of different opinions bc sometimes i feel like always being surrounded by people on social media of one ideology is making me more close-minded. so thank you!! was such a great podcast w really interesting conversation
Dear Ryan,  can you make trailer for pew die pie Vs tseries war
what if these podcasts fix Ryan's ADHD?
Pc-ness
Sounds a little close to something else
🤔🤔🤔
Sean is so soft spoken
Dear Ryan, Can you prove you are Ryan
Ryan be looking real good in this podcast. Also, Paco is everything <3
Dear Ryan, can you make an Apex legends movie trailer?
NSFW but manhwahentai(dot)com site is for you paco.
I agree with Ryan too when it comes to love lol damn I think I should finish watching 1st before commenting lol
"I feel less lost today" Coz Sean is there <3
Isn't it funny?
Episode 2 and 3 and the same VIEWS
Ryan just looks so freaking happy that Sean's there!!!!!!!
I reeeeeeally like how "real" this is. It's refreshing.
why is Sean called a guest?? he was and will be a part of RHPC
The part about Christina made me tear up a little bit....I also grew up watching her videos and it was a shock in the way she passed away. Definitely redefined how I thought of Youtubers and how much they risk by putting themselves out there.
i am loving these man! it legit feels like an actual conversation i'd have with my friends, what with jumping from topic to topic and the "PCness" and "politics" in general(even though yes we "don't really know anything about it" as well =P)! it's just too relatable and i love it xD keep em coming =) we do need Arden to be on some time though...... that's a must!!
Paco is really good at talking in podcasts. I like him when he's kinda serious lol
"Now can you imagine, like, what is is like to be like a girl."
-Paco 2019
I full on yelled "SEAN!!" when i saw (Ft. Sean Fujiyoshi)
Here my tips for student/fresh graduate
1.When you do your internships choose company that will hire you after you finish internships... it's more easier for you... 
2. Apply job that not related to your study but you have basic knowledge about that job... for example I'm pretty sure Sean learn basic programming in his university, so y not try apply to be programmer... nothing impossible since i know a lot of senior programmer that graduate in engineering..
3. Apply job in IT fields... I had a lot of friends graduate from other fields but work in IT fields...
not everyone who listens to a podcast lives in the first world
Everything Sean said about finding a job after college, the experience needed, and it being best to do internships in college is exactly what I would say too. Struggling with the same thing right now but in a different field. Thanks for doing this podcast! I could relate so much its crazy
This video gave me depre-sean
The discussion on the life of a public figure is just straight outta Eminem's Just The Way I Am.


As a relatively popular person within my university campus, I confirm everything they said to be pure FACTS!!! 
It's so hard to strike that balance between being a social figure but at the same time having personal space. Man! It be so hard sometimes!
This series actually rather mind opening experience for me, especially with how I currently relate with what had been discussed so far. Keep this podcast rolling!
Petition to have pewdiepie on otp? Likes = signings
Paco has such a soothing voice and does anyone else feel as if you’re with them while listening? The conversations are so interesting, I love listening to this podcast 🙌🏼
I clicked for Sean
Paco Boi : Greg is coming to grab ur sleeves
Better watch out
Can you do another parkcourse🥰😍🔥❣️😂🤣😅🙂
i want daina to come on the next episode and roast paco lolz
Ok so Ryan also uses a Zebra SARASA
Yea. We from sac and it’s hard to get an engineering job. Wish we could hook you up but we aren’t even in a position to do so. My husband had to commute to the Bay Area for a bit but eventually is now in sac. Keep trying and yep! Get the internship!!
Dear Ryan ,
Can you do a parody of birdbox or quiet place
Love van gogh’s starry night in the background! 
And fingers crossed for sean finding a job!
Yo Ryan, can I get hearted for 3 vids in row? 
Also 

SEEEEEEAAAAAAAAN
This video ended my depre- Sean 🙂😐.
they should get AJR on here it would be fun and stuff. thanks for reading this if you did.
Sometimes I wonder if this is Pacos or Ryan’s show
Ryan I've always felt like I'd get along really well with your group. Now that I've been listening to your podcasts I'm sure we would. Same hobbies, from Hawaii, like JRE. Keep up the podcast, I can tell you guys will keep improving.
I skipped randomly to the middle only to hear Paco aggressively ask "What do I do, do I pee on him?"
Sean, that’s called an Ambervert
When are you coming to England? I'm a huge fan and I have loved watching the channel grow and I really hope one day me and my friends (who all watch your vids) could meet you!!!!!
Yay Sean is back, that makes me so happy :3
i feel wrestling just makes u comfortable with the topic of poop or saying when you need to go lol
This video is the foam of the beer, don't @ me unless you want to catch some sleeves.
We are LOVING these podcasts Ryan!! Keep them coming... pewdiepie special guest???
No Valentine’s Day video?? D: awe. Oh well 😔
It would be lit if you guys could make the OTP podcasts longer , IT'S SO GOOOOOOOOOOD
11 Narutos / 10 Narutos
Can we get Jeremy Lin on the podcast?
YABO Crew please... like Tim Enos...
Paco talking about Pewdiepie is 👏👏
LOVED THAT YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT PRINCE EA
1:25:03 oh yes, thank you for that deep discussion about social media and not showing the whole story. that is honestly really true. and im working on it-not trying to jump to conclusions and judge so quickly. its something I hope to get rid of.
Is this Ryan’s new format, he posts a video and then posts a podcast video the next day... Works for me 😂
But remember 60% of nigahiga is made of Sean
for some reason, these podcasts make me feel like an educated person hahahaha
Finally had time to watch this~ anyway i missed Sean and def relate so much on finding jobs. I love this podcast! Hope to see more of Paco too!!!
SSSSEEEEAAAANNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved him so much and I wanted to cry for the goodbye Sean video. I was also Kind of surprised that none of them were like,"Sean! The OG! We miss you!" Like, REALLY!?!?  but I still love u Ryan.
MISSED SEAN!!!!!
Ryan: it's becoming the main stream media
Me: yep pewnews sure is
Paco: "I read a lot of Harems."
Ryan: "Isn't that called something else? Isn't that porn?"
This got me
Love this podcast, all really great advice about relationships! Keep it up.
I really appreciate these thoughts on open dialogue. The best way to make progress is to have a respectful conversation. Thanks for the great content, and good luck to Sean!
OTP with kevjumba
So I just came in from the latest podcast and I like how they've been ending it every time reminding themselves that's it's really bad for the mics to breath into them but they still friggin do it🤣🤣🤣
Another great podcast guys. Swear... Every time I listen to y'all, I wanna jump in the conversation. 🤣
1:08:36 I found what Ryan said to be very touching. Gotta look out for the boys.
Who wants Daina and Greg on the next podcast?
I gotta a buddy like that. We just always pick up our friendship when we see each other. I think we both understand that life gets in your way, but you it's not that we are ignoring each other.
This is my new favorite podcast! 

SEAAAAAANNNN!!!
50:18 Im clenching my booty.mSo much pressure,  im on first aid.
Shout-out Sean on Twitter there's always people from different industries retweeting job opportunities
The constant uploads tho, I'm loving this Ryan 💗💗
YES, WE GOT PACO ON OUR SIDE!
(Pewdiepies)
Ah Sean, as a fellow engineer: Yeah that internship is SUPER helpful. At my uni it's mandatory to get your BSc degree, and while it was awful, it's necessary. Listen to Sean, guys, get an internship!
Put Marques Brownlee (MKDHB) in your podcast as guest!
Prepare for a good video since they haven't post for in "long" time.
Seeing Sean and Ryan together on a video brings back memories
Exactly what they said about it being so easy to hate Paco because of the dynamic is so fucking true lmao. I definitely fell in love with Paco recently after hating him quite a bit in the beginning and now I feel SO. BAD. about it
Welcome back, ”Chon”
this podcast is my favorite content from this channel keep it up! love your flow and personality and the naturalness as compared to scripted skits
1:25:47 this is the answer for David being biased on Apple from the previous podcast
It’s kinda weird to see him as a “guest”
I love watching this while doing organizing my stuff XD or drawing
Why is Ryan's camera out of focus for the last half of the video?
I really liked this podcast!  Great job you guys :)
Only ogs remember Ryan’s Vocalstelolegerizerist!
I think I am in heaven because of how consistently Ryan is uploading. ABOUT 3 UPLOADS IN A ROW. When Ryan said he was going to be uploading much more frequently I didn't think he really meant much more frequently
I LOVE THIS PODCAST
Never related to paco so much. In anime
iM FrOm sAc ToO, HoLy ShI—
Man, Daina needs to grab Paco's sleeves.
Did I read the title right? Does it really say SEAN!!
y'know for some reason I can always relate to how Ryan thinks.


Also that Prince EA impression.
i cant believe SEAN is in this. WOW
Thnks for putting him in ur videos again.
Wow, that 1 1/2 hours just flew by!
The description made me sniffle 
“ and guest, Sean “
LMAO Ryans face when Sean says" i dont just wanna be a youtubeguy".
@around 33:31 I kind of see Ryan’s point from a different perspective. I’m an introvert too, but my friends know I love hugs. Once, my friend was super sad, and she suddenly hugged me. I was super caught off guard. Sometimes, you just don’t know how to respond either.
Top 3 anime 
1. Naruto
2. Death note
3. Bleach 🤟🏽☄️
Can you discuss the sub war between t series and pewdiepie on the next podcast. 
AND BE SURE TO GIVE PEWDS A SHOUTOUT!!
We're getting desperate
these podcasts are great! keep it up RHPC!
Let's have Arden on the show next!
Listening to this while in my internship. And I'm a mechanical engineer student too
I clicked for SEAN!!!
I hope Sean can get his job soon and he can maintain his mental health beyond his image on Youtube (the same also goes to Ryan, Paco, the rest of RHPC, and all Youtubers). I think I can understand that it feels suffocating and exhausting to be publicly exposed for most of introverted personality, heck even most extroverts also find it challenging.... It is important to find balance between the exposure and the limit of our intrapsychic energy to deal with the stressor. 
Things are tough for Sean and anyone that going through the phase of starting anew. Prayer for us all, God bless.
Love these podcasts bro really good to see something fresh on ur channel! Been here since How to be ninja ✊💯 honestly amazing to see what you've become 💯💯
Sean, it took me 6 months and 300 applications to land my first engineering job and I had to move across the country. My advice, not only apply to everything, but try to attend any job fairs in your area, and reach out to companies that may not even be hiring. Even if they don't have openings, if its something you are  genuinely interested in they will remember you asking questions or know someone that is hiring and send along your resume. Good luck man, its rough but I know you'll find a sweet gig when you get hired.
Dog whistling wrecks a lot of conversations.


Just like Ilhan Omar. Was she being antisemetic? No, definitely not. 


Could someone be mislead into thinking she's antisemetic? Definitely. Some things come across as dog whistles, but we shouldn't just jump to conclusions. It's important to look at the full context.
ryan is so much happier when sean is around
So... I say this as someone who's pretty much grown up watching you guys since the "How to be Ninja" days, and I'm about the same age too. Not American though, and yes Paco, we have internet in the third world too...and we do listen to podcasts. ;)

Would recommend paying more attention to politics! Even just Hawaiian politics. Might be shed some light on why "hey let's just talk with both sides and come to an agreement" isn't always possible or fruitful, usually the case when the power disparity between various parties involved is huge.

See also: Brexit. :p
i think it is very relatable to like harem manga or anime because as a teen i was also all about me (the protagonist) and women. at times i literally didnt have any real friends, only the chicks i chased and myself
Lol sean has experience he built some crazy shit for Ryan
Sean Fujiyoshi is awesome on the podcast. Ryan invite Danny Gonzalez PLLLLZZZ
As soon as Ryan asked what was Sean's favorite video I immediately thought of "How to be Ninja 1.0 and 2.0" also Ryan can you heart this!😓
i think being a youtuber for a good youtuber is an easy and very rewarding job. at the same time, i‘d suck at it and not like it a whole lot
Sean’s an Irish name is he part Irish!!!!!!!

Fan fiction!!!!
OMG Sean






Like if youve been subbed before sean left
In my experience, i haven’t met someone who doesnt like dbz or naruto
SK2 in singapore is well known. yes to Ryan.
I really enjoy these videos... How the subjects are brought up is quite down to earth, real but still not as heavy as what I initially thought it was :) happy to wait for more
The tactics worked
This Sean guy is funny...he should join RHPC
I wanna get hearted too😥😭
This is a super great podcast and I loved all the topics you covered. Keep up the good work!
Do a part where you guys are taking through multiple topics speaking pidgin!
I wouldn't want to be a YouTuber for the fame of it. I'd want to be one cause it'd hopefully be something that I enjoyed doing and I could make a living doing it and be my own boss.  I'm way more interested in the freedom aspect of it.  And having the knowledge that you're putting something out there that people enjoy is also nice.  

Really enjoying this series BTW
Whenever my counselor asks me "What are your plans next year", I think: Ryan is posting more frequently so I´ll be fine.
I read Sean's surname as Fujoshi and was like 'great! Ryan's making a podcast about fujoshis!'
I know this was posted a month ago, but every time I listen/watch one of these I smile😊
I honestly dint know why whenever Ryan says "welcome back to another episode of" im so ready to hear "I DARE YOUUUUUU"
I love the neutral point of view of this podcast. It is so new to me when all I see is either left or right but no rational unbiased point of view.
Thank you for the advice. Now I'm aware of the purpose of internships. Hope you find a great job Sean :)
New Ray William Johnson
I love putting this podcast on and listen/watch while I eat or do my makeup or whatever, it's the perfect thing!
You know what to do when you don't know much about politics. Just say, "the latter"!
Sean, I wouldn't give up on trying to apply for internships still. Since you're right out of college some companies still find it acceptable. And you can say you wanted to do an internship because you're not sure if you're going to continue on with school or start working for an industry yet. I have a friend who applied for an internship right out of college and after the interview process they offered him a full-time position instead. I hope you see this!
I tried it. I ain't gonna lie the bounces work 👌
We need Teehee Time
Sean's voice sometimes so low paco's on the other hand could sound sooo loud... Throughout the video im busy adjusting the volume... 😂🔊
I freaking love these podcasts, please do this every week!
Sean!!!!!
I am finally being productive with my life
I hear you Shawn. Trying to get an entry level accounting job is near impossible in my area. Most of those got outsourced to India.
so what're the next topics? or you guys decide it randomly along the talks?
I love NARUTO
Who else can watch the whole thing without getting bored?
do a cooking but not really or parkourse now that sean is here plsss
I want an episode with Raphael Bob-Waksberg. :D
Ryan Higa's podcasts are best for driving. I never get sleepy. 😁
I want Hyan Riga on the show!
SEAN!!! OMG, ive just been skimming thru the podcasts, but this is something im gonna watch completely when i find the time...needa cure my depreSean
props to Sean for being very open about his career aspirations and struggles - very relatable for a lot of people in our age demographic
Why are you all wearing hyper x's and covering the logos?
Dear ryan,
Did you played 
APEX LEGENDS?????
Totally understand why Sean decided not to go with the Youtube path. Like he said, it is pretty controversial platform and keeping up with all the changes is very stressful. Really hope you get an opportunity to show your skills Sean, I'll pray for you:)
I love these so much keep them going
Dang it’s hearted🙌🏽
Yeah.. I was doing the bouncies while you all were describing it during my commute back home. 😂
Tell Sean that personal projects in your field also goes a long way.
SEAAAAAN IS BACK! SEAAAAAAAN IS BACK [he is in town(temporarily tho:<)]
I like this more than the old content. I sound like a basic ass person for that, but I enjoy hearing about stuff going on thats more realistic.
Who else wants kevjumba on the podcast
Sean talking about relationship, engineering degree and fame is the best thing ever to watch/listen to. I enjoy this one hour and a half. Hope there’s more Sean in the future!
how can you not love paco
Look at his Naruto figurine
So many people can to that"
"MY MOMENT TO SHINE
Do you still talk to Chester? I'd like to see Chester or KevJumba for old times sakes
What field of engineering does Sean know?
I’m loving the progression of the podcasts!! Each time it seems like Ryan and Paco get more comfortable and if feels so genuine!! Keep up the great content! Love seeing Sean back!
The boundaries thing is so true, it makes me sad how much behind the scenes crap y'all youtubers gotta deal with and then feel guilty for wanting to have your space, or dealing with your own things at the time. My mom says health is the most important thing, so mental health goes with that. I'm glad you guys are okay talking about these things, great podcast! :3
Also, mandatory SEAN!!! 😂
❤️🧡💜❤️❤️🧡💜❤️
Podcasts are amazing.☺️
It's sad to see that a youtuber like Ryan that puts in so much effort and creativity in his videos don't get the same amount of subs or even more than pewds. Ryan could have easily gained way more subs by joining the whole T-series vs pewdiepie drama that most youtubers are hyping about but he didn't and he still sticks to being the OG ryan higa himself. My all time fav youtuber 🙌🏼 🙌🏼
i love how you guys talk about things you're actually passionate about, like politics and other things. It's always exciting to see youtubers being people who have opinions because usually they're too scared of upsetting people
As a fellow engineer,  I am rooting for you, Sean!! I think you would like CAD work if you're into graphics. A lot of firms (at least here in the Midwest) have dedicated CAD people. My company has an office in Novato but it's mostly an environmental focus office I think. Wishing you the best!!
Ryan I love you! Not creepy just your such a universal love type person. Hope I get to meet some day!
These podcasts have been awesome so far! Keep it up lol
Sean and Ryan are really humble about their YT careers. Good for them.
This series is so nice to just listen when I am doing work, or doing art.
You should get the racka racka twins to do I dare you pls pls pls
Hey Sean - I’ve been unemployed out of college for 7 months and I had 4 internships!
for some reason, I find the voice of you guys very calming, I just play it to fall asleep at night (very useful), please do more podcasts ><
As someone who's in their 20s now, this podcast is really something that I can relate to. Finding jobs, being an adult, maintaining friendship and talking about relationship.. Those topics cover most of my concerns nowadays. Thank you for talking about those stuffs and making me feel better. 💖
This amazing podcasts open all members of team-family wide and makes this more close and understandable. Sean a on good way now and he are right person! Wish he will get success soon!
Sean miss you so much !
Please come back to ryan's channel !!!!
Cleaned my room and listened to this podcast. 👌👌👌 The best.
Dude actually I've met a celebrity in a public toilet before. I waited for him to finish peeing, wash his hands, and approach him. Hahahahaha those story are weird man
18:41
This conversation was really professional. Love it guys. Keep it up!!
Is Ryan out of focus of the shishi break?
Social media has altered society's perception of manners and common courtesy.  They've pretty much just gone out the window.  It's all about "me, me, me" nowadays.  Sad, but true.
WOW! I didn't expect an actual ad at the shishi break.
(oh wait, the video's halfway through)
How do you feel that Jeremy Lin just got signed to Toronto rapter
"I'll turn myself down" 

Proceeds turn up volume
Woaaah pacos radio voice! That was so cool😂😂😂
Paco is my fav member of rhpc. Seems like a really chill likeable guy, like everyone else
ive had a really rough...month tbh and watching these podcasts has calmed me down so much. i feel like i always end up saying this but it really just feels like im hanging out with my friends, especially being that i was also born and raised in hawaii & basically grew up with you guys since how to be ninja. its always felt like such a safe place that i can come back to no matter how long its been, just like how sean and ryan described their relationship. i absolutely love how honest and open and unashamed(?) you all are about your thoughts and opinions, its so damn refreshing to hear that you guys dont just want to be right but that you actually want to have a discussion and come to a compromise. we definitely need more people like you in the world so thank you for encouraging and inspiring others to follow suit ❤️ love you guys, i deeply appreciate all that you do & i hope you take care of yourselves! im wishing sean the best of luck in finding a job, shits hard but i know theres always hope!
"This man needs no introduc-SEAN" lol 😂
YO SEAN IS BACK FOR THIS VIDEO. I’m so hype!!!!!
I just love how we get to know some parts of you guys more through these vids 💖
If you wanna do engineering, major in computer engineering and if there's something specific you're looking to do, then minor in that. There is literally so much you can do with an engineering degree in computer engineering. Also, when you are looking for universities, look at the CO-OPs/internships they offer and connections they have with companies. Trust me, it's a lifesaver.
idk if this is even possible but if you could bring back some of the old crew (kev, chester etc) that would be so cool. but esp kevin that would be a miracle
You guys need to do a parkourse while he's here
i appreciate the politic bit and the genuine podcast in general :)
bring back DEAR RYAN
please
We need an off the pill with J and J or vice versa. MAKE IT HAPPEN!!
Seeing ryan's videos again, it makes me nostalgic, omg my childhood is coming back
Bro i would love to come on one day and talk to u.. I survived cancer twice and lost half my face to amputation.. a tumor destroyed my jaw and changed everything.. I was labeled a freak. I decided to start over, travel South America and start a youtube channel to inspire others who feel ugly and not good enough for this world.. it's all about energy and mindset.. my scars will not define me. with optimism and positive projection you can overcome any mental or physical hurdle. self love from within overpowers any physical shell! go check me out and subscribe if you want to help me grow. i want to give people a spark of change and join me on my journey!
Dude I love these podcasts. It’s real interesting to just hear you guys discuss with one another.. thank you so much for keeping it real!
Thank you for entertaining me while I clean my bathroom again 🙏🏼
I love this new content please don't stop
Every single word Paco said about love, even his experience (which I experienced 3 times lol) I felt to my core.
Paco sounds like Sal from Khan Academy
is this like the better version of impaulsive?!
can u do one with greg :3
Do you still keep contact with kevjumba?
Sean is the reason i am happy. Thanks for the advice about internships.
Ryan can u pls play jump force with RHPC
“I’m a little less lost today”

CUZ SEAN IS HERE!!!! <3
Also, if you want to switch fields. Land surveying is a demanding field atm.
I discovered an OP strat.....
If you're trying to snipe a photo of Ryan next time don't make that t rex but take the pic like you normally would instead smile and add a pose so it seems that youre taking a selfie

Oh frick 
Gotta be careful
The FBI is after me
Like if ryan should bring back parkourse
these are really great guys! keep it up, im loving these heavy debates. lotta love <3
I've been in a similar position as Sean (as a software engineer though). Wish you lots of luck! You need your first job in that field once and then it feels like everything gets so much easier.
We want a valentine video or a vlog with Arden
Honestly, screw those who hire only based on connections and 'valuable' experience rather than looking deeper and finding someone who matches the workplace; and can potentially become one of their most valuable assets- if they weren't so lazy enough to train and teach newbies. They need to give everyone a chance, because they would never know who they missed out on employing. 

I feel like this is becoming a modern day problem for today's youth that are graduating from university with a degree with no guaranteed job. I relate to Sean so much and to find that there are so many others in the comment section experiencing the same thing sucks so much. I graduated 3 years ago from Pharmacy with Honours and spent over 1 year looking for a job. It was tough because I lived so far away, there were many peers who had ridiculous connections to the pharmacy industry, and most importantly I lacked experience. All the job applications wanted interns that were smart, and had experience, which sucked because although I was very smart, I did not have that much experience. Unfortunately after trying so long, I realised that no one was going to be give me a chance despite how confident I was with my skills so I went looking for other options. In the end I helped out at by managing my Mum's new business and that's my job now. I am happy and the pay my Mum gives me is enough to get me over the line (probably won't be as good as a job in Pharmacy would have paid... but at least I have a job now) & I have learnt a lot more about myself. I'm taking a different path that what I planned for so I'm excited to what may come next- it's definitely not easy managing a shop and also working ridiculous hours but it's fun and I've met a lot of different people and connections. For my colleagues I keep in touch with I find that it's a vicious cycle that doesn't end because once their contract ends, they have to start this process again of finding a job, the hours are not stable and always changing and most of them only work part-time.. Thinking back, I don't know whether all the studying was worth the degree if we will struggle to find a stable job after graduating.. 

But anyway, I think I got too sidetracked and carried away. I really hope it works out for Sean whether he manages to find a job in his chosen field or whether a different path will open up for him. All the best! Stay Strong! :)
I DONT HAVE DEPRES-SEAN ANYMORE
I am so happy to see Sean back. More than a guest he kinda feels like family. I wish you get your desired job soon. 😊
Has anyone found the video of Sean, Wes and Mari?
I REALLY want to see it!
Sean!!! Miss him! Keep it up guys! 🤙🏼
this podcast shows appreiciaSEAN
Feels weird seeing Sean talk so much 😂
I actually got an ad during the shi shi break which was awesomebut kind of interesting considering you guys had finished talking about sponsors
This is literally love this podcast. It’s so underrated though,.,,,
awww, they are growing up so fast!
I agree with Paco on his anime preferences. Its not so lame and really is relatable
Plz do a cookn....but not really






.......but not really
Do a podcast with Kevjumba!
Sound board? It's called a Launch Pad, I've always wanted one of those things! That's so cool! That U guys got one of those!
I love that Sean and I live in the same city now.
Wait did Ryan say he's Keto!??! Ryan if you see this I do Weekly Instagram Live Interviews and would love to interview you man! I'm sure you're super busy but would love the opportunity. "@Keto_Steve" on Instagram!
Ryan doesn't age
Paco made a really good point about how people take the easy route. And it makes sense in this specific situation, but also it makes sense in so many other things in life, like humans are lazy, and most of the time we take the easy route in life.
❤️❤️❤️


i wanted to comment something beautiful to support you but i got nervous (-:
❤️❤️❤️


i wanted to comment something beautiful to support you but i got nervous (-:
We need a reserved seat for paco even when he can't make it
SEAN!!!!!!!! love the podcasts so far by the way.
Loving all of the podcast episodes. Can't wait to see who the next guest is.
Paco plays a fool sometimes but he seriously have some deep thoughts. And i love how he warns ryan before he proceeds to talk about christina knowing it was a dark time for him/them.
"girls dont even have buttholes" -sean 2019
Wait. My friends call me seen too. 







I’m really not alone.
Sean’s back in this episode
What if I told you that...







Ur mom big gae for real
Cole Sprouse has an Instagram channel dedicated to he sniping pictures of people sniping pictures of him! (Camera Duels)
Man this was great I had so much I wanted to say, but I just don't know how to verbalize it now. You guys are so calming to listen to and I thought this was very insightful and thoroughly enjoyed it :)
so im a second year engineering student and im doing an internship right now. but my commute is over an hour long and I'm still a total stranger to everyone I work with and I really dont feel like im doing much. spirits are low but videos like these always make me feel better. thank you sean for making me feeling better about my situation ❤️
Elon Musk as a suggestion for Off The Pill?
5:31 "Oh dude" is back!
ok.. I am really sick right now.. and I found a great way to feel better.. playing computer games and having these podcasts run on the other screen :) Thanks for the input!
Dear Ryan, do the ''Naruto mirror run Challenge'' please 😁
Honestly, Sean sounds like me! I have my degree, but everyone wants experience, but no one is willing to give it. Even doing internships. It's so frustrating! I have a 44k student loan to repay and nothing to show still. Graduated with honors as well. It's just ridiculous. Best of luck, Sean! You've got this! 👍🤞
Thank you general paco, very cool
Sacramento <3
lmao when i try to take a picture of someone i usually fake a phone call and just hit the volume button to take it 😂😂
storytime-Naruto was the first anime iv'e seen and I cried in the first and last episode of the show
I actually love this podcast so much.
omg. i'm dating a younger version of sean lol. listen to sean's relationship advice guys!! and ryan's "you don't always have to be right" advice, totes hit home lo.
I JUST JOW SAW THIS WND SEANS BACK OMG
Literally watching this at the gym, oops
i love the podcasts
Get Jeremy Lin for next podcast guess.
ryan u da best i love ur vids also hi sean
we need a comeback


from BGA!!
can you guys talk more about relationships and heartbreak next time? thanks!
Sean is back?
Dealing with Fans?
Liam Neeson Racist?
Podcast?
Hotel ?
TRIVAGO
I think Paco is really funny. It's nice that he's in the podcasts :))
It's true when it comes to electrical/mechanical engineering, they want us to have 5-10 years of experience. I was fortunate enough to have found something but I also think about going back to school and change my career... I can relate to Sean.
I don't know if you still talk to them all but what about having the different YTF members as guests on the podcast.
I Live In Nigeria. It's not the first world but I do like the finer things. Lol
Can you make a Hilla Hawai vlog sorry if I spelt it wrong
these off the pill podcasts are so interesting that if you still make them when I am a dad, I'll listen to them in the car on the way to work
Sean should engineer his own product and have you guys Kickstart it.
Im honestly mind blown on how similar my views are with you guys.. I have these talks about pc culture, open conversations, media, politics, etc with my friends all the time b/c they want to hear my opinion (as someone who is apolitical) and everytime they basically treat me like im a horrible/dumb person just because my views don't align with what THEY think is right. So, hearing your guy's thoughts on today's society/culture SUPER refreshing and makes me feel like im not alone in where I stand! SO THANK YOUU!! Im REALLLLY enjoying your podcasts!! 😭💕
BONDARIES. James BONDARIES
Loving the podcast please moreee
Ryan Higa for president
Has Sean considered at working at a startup (idk what kind of engineering he's doing) but they're more willing to hire with less experience with the caveat of less pay too.
money can't buy happiness but it can buy you a bout and a truck to pull it with.
I love how Ryan reaches out to fans
Okay, Braced for the Podcast. Wouldn't do this if it wasn't nigahiga.
1:09:22

I came here to have a good time but why do I feel attacked? 

😞😂
DEAR RYAN.
CAN YOU MAKE A VOCAL MUSIC OF UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ANTHEM?PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
53:10 Ryan just described my life with my best friend. Accurate af.
Definitely worth watching  when I'm free and got nothing to do.🐏. Loved it.
Dang. I started following you guys back in high school.... like 10 years ago. This is crazy. My first video was the hardy potter remake where you guys just say your names to a rythm. That was internet gold. Then how to be a ninja. I'll always love you guys. 💜
That last section about having 'the conversation' was SO good!
how nigahiga got its name:
Ryan lost his niga but got his higa
Yeah...some people really need to be open minded. People are getting hate in the society just because of vague news in the media. Like how Brie Larson got all the hate recently.
Get Greg on the Podcast..??? That man's voice is so RARE asdfghjkl..!!
Ryan c'mon talk about your relationship
Conversations are how you solve problems. You have to hear both sides & then try to work it out
responding to the liam neeson thing.. I'm not saying he's racist NOW, but he definitely admitted to being racist then. Yes he realized that revenge isn't the answer and attacking someone won't help him or his friend. But he hasn't realized that it was fucked up that he wanted to hurt any black person. I can understand (but not condone) wanting to hurt the person who hurt you, but I cannot understand him going out trying to find a random person to hurt, that needs to have the same skin color. I can't explain my point very well, but I hope it makes some sense still?? Like even if he said he was trying to find ANY person to hurt, that would have been 'better' (as in less racist) than saying he wants to find any BLACK person, idk
I’m doing my engineering degree, and I applied for 2 internships but got rejected
Sean is seriously giving me some Uncle Iroh vibes 💙
42:59 mr beast!!!!!
PLEASE Do Cooking but not really
Make a video about the world ending in 2030 (I don’t have ideas)
Yea Sean is right I live in Sacramento and it does feel like a big town
Also I love this podcast so much I just listen while I’m doing my hw and stuff thanks guys for blessing us all
paco is so good in podcasts!! lov off the pill :)
Listening to this after a 15 hour shift. Keep it up guys!
i DIED at Paco's Prince EA imitation. "row, row, ROW your boat." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Suggestion for the end of the podcast: the sound of uncapping a pill bottle and tipping out the pills.
Sean is absolutely right. Communication and mutual understanding. Yet here I am still single because I can’t find anyone who understands that 😭
Introvert + Extrovert = Ambivert ; We are Ambiverts
Sometimes u just wanna lie on your bed, relax.... and listen to people talk XD
Why do you cover the branding of your hyper x cloud alphas?
Come on Ryan! Heart this!
I've been commenting for years!!
Future featured guest, MKBHD? On one of his latest video showing what's on his devices. His podcast app had the Off The Pill podcast on it.
I need friends like this 😂
Sean is so quiet...it’s just Paco and Ryan. I hope Sean talks more hahahahha
Sean just cured my depresSEAN
I think a lot of people want open conversation, but the political landscape is dominated by angry and condescending people, and they tend to get more clicks and are much more effective at preaching to their choirs.
Do you hate walking? Or step on a welcoming word on the ground? Laughing & getting lost during afterschool? Well, worry no more! Introducing the Doorstep! That's right! With just one click you'll be at your doorstep in instant ultra transmission. Welcome to Walman GPS Company!

I can see Ryan getting lost here!

Ryan: Wait but how can someone teleport using a device? 😠

Me: (Music playing) 🙄 When worse comes to worst all you have to do is curse!
my dad is a drafting engineer for oil companies and it is difficult to find work at first. Sean might have an easier time getting certifications at colleges like lone-star. It doesn't take 4 years, you're able to get an internship, and it's not as expensive as university. Hope this helps and  GOOD LUCK SEAN!!!
As soon as Paco brought up harem manga I was like "Did he read To-Love Ru?? Oh god he read Ichigo 100%!! Oh my god!" I relate to him soo much
"I don't want my kids to know me as 'the YouTube guy'" ....dang
44:51 Tom Brady's kids might be watching. I'm imagining them running out to their father,"Hey Dad! Ryan Higa wants you on his podcast!"
dear Ryan i dare you to do a back flip plz
I love conversations like this where it just flows from topic to topic and then you wonder how you got on a topic hahah.
Sean is back!!
When you realize Ryan does off the pill everyday just to not be on his pills.😂😂 Love the vids
That whole fan talk about boundaries and stuff made me so sad thinking about sasaeng fans and what those idols have to deal with
I super appreciate this podcast because it shows very "grown up" conversations. Super cool to see that because you have such a reach. Lol. Idk why but its almost like people know you for just being a funny guy on YouTube and it's almost like everything you say is a joke but you're a real person with opinions on real issues. That's cool to see. Hopefully that doesn't mean more fans start relating even more and crossing the boundaries though XD

Although if I ever saw you in public... I still don't know what I'd do. I'll try my best not to trex a photo
dear Ryan make a video about a valentine day
Dear Ryan
Can you explain a robot without using any scientific words except the word robot
SEAN'S IN TOWN!
i could listen to sean’s voice for hours his voice is so relaxing 😌
S E AAA NNNNNN
Exactly just yelling at somebody doesn’t change their mind
Enjoyed the conversation, also the prior conversation in podcast #2. The topics are good and the fact you just talk through them and not regurgitate sound bites, which is a subject you hit on tonight, I appreciate.
Would it be possible to get KevJumba on the podcast??
Ryan you are my favorite Youtuber I love your videos.
You should do an I dare you that is only scary/creepy stuff, like the haunted cabin one
Sean try applying for Engineering in Hotels!!!
I should listen to this podcast way more often this is a good mix of silly and professional. Also PCness/rage culture is to hop on anything that angers you without knowing the entirety of the situation.
As soon as I saw Sean’s name, I knew this was gonna be good
I'm still a server almost 2 years after I graduated with a bachelor's in IT. I have no experience either. It's tough not being able to get a job in your field.
I need links to every mentioned episode that they all about like aquaman and how to be ninja 😂😭
I wonder if Sean has looked at UC Davis or a Cal State school for jobs.
Sean, if you decide to go back to school, with ME as foundation and you love graphics, i think you'll really enjoy Industrial Design.  I chose ID for similar reasons and for me it's a perfect combination science and art. Job wise, nothing is guaranteed, because life. But just a suggestion :)
Who like before watching the video? It's SEAN!!!!!!!!!
Sean you interested in solar engineering in Oakland? Nonprofit company that also offers trainings in the solar industry.
AR is augmented reality, not artificial
I like podcast with video:) I actually enjoy this kind of content a lot~~
Whatever Sean do he should not doubling down on his mechanical engineering degree if it doesn't work for him.
Petition to have Greg and Dana on the next podcast ??? :33
I’m really glad you brought up the topic of the controversy of that white kid and the Native American man. You are absolutely right, and most media made him out to be some kind of monster when he literally did nothing.
I miss you, Sean!
bro paco harem anime protagonists are made to be super generic so anyone can insert themselves OMEGALUL
" I Got Passion In my Pants " Paco -2019
Thank you Sean for being open with us and I am sure many can relate with your struggles. All the best in your job seeking journey and please keep coming back to the show. WE ALL MISS YOUU SEANNN
You need experience to get a job, but every job needs experience. We are all in hell, it's fine.
1:14:06 that is actually a really good point and way to think about it. thanks for that.
wait sean's hat is forward. i guess he really has changed
why do i always get goosebumps when i hear anything about anime
I agree with the Pidgin thing. For me it depends on who I'm talking to or when I get all excited about something then the pidgin comes out xD
Bruh the bounce thing worked lmao. I did it for like 10 seconds and I instantly had to poop
14:51 I don't know if it was on purpose but Sean kinda looked at Paco and his face just looked like "and... uh never mind that" XD
I've realy grown up with you guys, since I've watched the "How to be..." series as 12 year old kid 10 years ago. And now I still can relate so much to Sean, because I'm in a quiet long relationship (almost 6 years) and it's been most of the time a long distance one. I'm wishing him so much joy and love, from my heart, which has broken every time he left.
It took me a while, but now all members of the team are equal precious to me (even Paco ;) ) and I really enjoy to watch your videos! <3
Great to see you back in a more candid way Ryan!
Paco sounds like a guy from Khan Academy
I don't know if anyone noticed but, Paco's camera was out of sync for a while but they fixed it after 34:15 , it's barely noticable because they put few Sean frames right before. 
(Now I'm not 100% sure, maybe it's just Paco's mouth that's weird but, if it turns out it was out of sync I'm actually gonna be somewhat proud that I noticed the moment they tried to fix it unnoticeably (if that's a word) )
The fact that Paco, one of the most majestic fellows I have ever seen, was in his first real relationship at 27 makes me feel so much better
Please have Daina next podcast?
Dude I just listen to this podcast and that clockwise circling thing on the stomach WORKS FOR ME LIKE WONDERS... But yeah girls dont poop uhh so never mind what I said previously ._.
yo ryan i listen to your podcast everyday and every time you make a new video i go around the house and tell all my siblings that you uploaded
I'm so introverted too 😂😫😭hard time looking for a job now too
i love all of these sean puns. they’re so seansational!
Paco literally EXPOSES himself! That should have been in the title :p
sean. i feel you on the LDR.... my boyfriend and I have been in a LDR since 2014, and only this past 4 months had we seen each other almost every week, but then he moved out to Missouri because he got a job, so were back to LDR - but we've been together for 7 years, so I get it!
i’m glad that ryan seems like he’s genuinely having a good time making these, i love these!
nigahiga, I can see the consistency.
drinking game : a shot every time sean says "you know".
Ryan higa is an introvert.  Its like saying 1+1=3
YouTube killed the tv stars
Im in love with paco. How can he be so childish but SO WISE?! Ahhh
Off The Pill is the only podcast I've ever listened to
40:14
It's actually the 14 year old army, but ok.
OMG ITS SEEN FUJIOSHI
What if the Ryan Gang read this comment. 🤔
Seen is finallyyyyy back :)))
Sean!! Glad to hear you're in my hometown Sac! Sorry you're having such a hard time finding jobs :( I would say the best places to get engineering jobs would be through the State, Intel, and Aerojet. There's lots of sectors within the State so if one doesn't work out, you can try the others. Another option is to contact the nearby schools (Sacramento State or UC Davis) and maybe ask some professors for volunteer positions in their labs? Just to get some experience. Otherwise if you're considering going back to school, Sacramento State is not bad, and I know plenty of people who go to school there and do part-time/full-time work at the same time.
Best of luck to you man! Please bump up so he can see this!
Why did I immediately think birth control pills
WHY DONT YOU UPLOAD IN 60FPS
This is really good👍🏾
I'm an engineer who fortunately got an internship while in school. Crazy part is I didnt deserve it academically, but focused on networking which landed me the internship. That's definitely great advice on focusing on getting an internship while in school since I had a job on day one out of college with the company I interned with. Good luck Sean! Hope it ends up working out.
Dude I love the podcasts, I don’t know how regular they’re gonna be but if they were weekly that’d be dopeee! Keep it up
I love these Podcasts <3
You didnt describe friendship. You described family
Imagine a ryan chigga “dat stick” version
I love Off the Pill podcast. It's honestly so interesting to just listen to. Mahalo to you brah. Maui boi
You should have kevjumba on the podcast
I really like Paco serious or not he's really sexy when he's serious. ^_^
i took arts and i am not even good at it
I miss Regina! 😂
Do a podcast with Chester See! We miss him
so when should we tell them Elon just went on meme review for the memes?...
Dear Ryan, can you do a face reveal?
even if you do a clerk job, you might not be able to leave work behind even after you are out of the office, it really depends on your personality, the responsibilities that come along with your position at the company, and your personal life
Dear Ryan, 


Make a video on why asian guys are introverts.
I really enjoy hear podcasts, I finding it relaxing. Time flies :)
I got an ad during the shi shi break! XD
love your vids
Paco brought back hardcore memories of school when he said "share it with the class" :p
Dear Ryan,

Please talk about sex in your next podcast. Get personal. Take your channel to the next adult level. Take a break from cute silly stuff. TAKE ME ON A DATE if you use my suggestion. TEEHEE 😝😄
Love how paco act like he has fans xD
Sean's back.
0:21 meme review 👏
ryan all the way ... :) never disappoints me..
I honestly love Ryan doing these podcasts and everything else he wanted to do this year, I personally love all of these new types of videos and especially Off The Pill Podcast
Dear Ryan 

Can you make a giant chain reaction
Personally love this podcast series! It really makes me feels like I have friends when I don’t have friends
when ryan and sean were talking about how their friendship worked, it really made me reminisce about the friendship between my best friend and I. we have periods of time that can last months where we just don't talk because we're too busy, but the moment we see each other, it's like we're little kids playing with each other again. thank you sean and ryan for making me remember the importance of my best friend and I's relationship and honestly being great dudes <3
The best way to defeat your enemy, is to make them your friend
I agree with this podcast
Did anyone else notice the ring on Sean’s marriage finger?!
You should have Daina in the podcast! :)
Love these podcasts!
I love Liam "Neesom". Such a great actor. That darn Liam "Neesom" doin a dang good job 😂😂
OMG I am working my business and even on days I schedule time off I am always thinking about work.  So true guys.  But when you love what you do, it becomes a part of you.
SEAN, PACO AND RYAN IN THE SAME VIDEO MY DREAMS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED!
the guy in the podcast looks like he still hasn't let go completely and might still miss youtuber lifestyle
Bro, I'm watching all these while writing my 8 page paper that's due tonight. Such amazing background "music". Thanks Ryan! PS. It's 6 pm and I have 4 pages, Sean can volunteer to write my paper.
Wow such a relatable, chill and real conversation until paco starts shouting about having fans
Pretty sure it's "Augmented Reality" not "Artificial Reality"
Cant wait til daina comes on the podcast 😊
With the Liam Neeson issue, I think you guys are right that people are generally quick to jump on the popular side of things because it's quick or safer...but there's a lot of nuances to this. Especially if you watch his follow up coverage of the interview. And also when you're talking about an event that's discussing racial tensions I think it'd be better to include someone in the room (from that ethnic background) that can give you more context as to why there is anger in the black community over the issue. Chalking it up to everyone just jumping to conclusions and saying that people only stopped at the headline can be considered pretty hazardous and tone deaf...especially because black people are use to being written off as overreacting and not being listened to. In this case I think it shows with Paco, he only saw the surface reaction of the black community and not the in depth conversations that were also being had, the grievances being expressed.  I think Paco was less objective or neutral than he wanted to appear in this situation or really just not informed on the full scope of the issue at hand -- and this isn't a news podcast or anything you guys are just giving your opinions, i understand that, but this lacks context just as much... it's just as misleading and dangerous to make it seem like people overreacted and are brainwashed. If anything it encourages some of your audiences to further be unwilling to listen and have those conversations you're talking about because they assume all noise is just loud and irrational noise. Please keep that in mind.
What a wonderful podcast! I'm going for my Psychology BS degree rn and the dealing with fans section was so interesting! I remember when I met Sean in my hometown years ago and I couldn't BELIEVE he was there! I was like wait what the hell is that Sean from youtube?! He was so kind and sweet considering how nervous and shocked I was. I always look back and wonder was how I reacted appropriate? With his kindness I always felt that it was okay. It's interesting how intense it can be for both the fan and the star... what makes us forget the reality of these "star individuals" as normal like us? Why do we change when that occurs? Because you know you wouldn't usually go as wild if you met just another stranger. One small thing to add (as a Psych major) is the words of "crazy" and "insane". Totally not a thing to worry about, but might as well add two cents right? The fans though they may seem "crazy" we should all try to kill the stigmatizing words for what's actually "crazy" and what's not. What they sometimes do is HIGHLY inappropriate, and sometimes irrational, and ampathetic towards you guys as professionals and human beings, but while we try to change this idea of how to approach people who have more fame, and people we look up to, let's try to change the way we phrase it :) I'm sure many people (fans) would hear it so much better if they were put like that. 

Wonderful podcast!!
58:16 yes ryan- The guy from bleach's name is Ichigo Kurosaki
43:33  Tom Brady's parents live by me, and he went to my school
This is the only podcast I watch
“I’m not smart enough”
“I know”
Paco is so insightful &smart.
Get arden on the podcast!!
a whole episode of you three talking in pigeon and us trying to decipher that, would be an awesome vid!
Is that a bird? Is that a plane?






No it’s Sean!
Tell Sean to go into civil or communication engineering!
Have Phil and/or Wes from Wong Fu on!
didnt know i would enjoy watching podcast this much.
Most underrated and unappreciated people on Youtube.
1:15:00 Regina just appeared out of sudden😂😂😂
Ive been watching & staying with you I’m so glad. It’s funny bc I met you & listening to this was like ohOhOH! Thank you for finding yourself & I’m excited to see the content you’re happy making <33
Dear Ryan you should do a video of doing how to be Hacker
Paco! You're loved!
that slight audio desync
My friend and I literally have no contact for four years in college, but when we finally saw each other, we picked up where we left off. It's nice to know that it doesn't mean we don't care. :)
I live in Sacramento. Try applying to red hawk casino. There are plenty of engineer positions available
Do a podcast with Deena, it would be good to hear the girls, too :-)
am i the only one who's actually worrying that ryan's subscribers are keep decreasing? :(
Hey Ryan, can you do how to be ninja 3.0 about ninja the streamer
Sean looks like Matt Murdock
Dear ryan
How about a video on soap bubbles
I was on the toilet while watching the pooping methods and I tried the bouncing method and IT WORKED!!!
Loving the more consistence uploads
Damn. I wasn’t planning on watching this whole thing but then I just got hooked listening.
Dear Ryan, can you do 3 backflips in a row
OMG SEAN OMGOMGOM SEANN UWU
Also, with all the "how did we get here"s.... I'm kinda thinking jacksepticeye would be a good guest on the show :P

EDIT: Welp, the likes have spoken. Ryan, you GOTTA invite Sean (the jacksepticeye one) on now!
Pull my sleeves now passion pants
Hihi, i love this!
You know Røde is a Danish Word... at least 'ø' is only existing in the Danish language. So it Translate to 'Red' or 'the red (as in red people)'... so yeah fun fact. 
I'm Danish by the way...

Keep going!
This comment is a reminder where I am in the video 38:25

Edit: 56:40
no, girls don’t poop. we’re too good for pooping.





(im just kidding lol)
“What do you want to be when you grow up?” 
“i wanna be pApER”
Pls do a Dear Regina!!
can you do it with kev jumbo
Seen ●u●
Yo, Sean should find contractor jobs to get experience. Since internships aren't possible anymore.
Is it just me or does Ryan keep getting hotter by the episode?
sean = shawn
Dear Ryan, can you make your own full episode of the big bang theory? We could count the "teehee" laugh tracks in it😏
I don't know if ryan or sean reads this, but sean can apply for rocket lab, which is in huntington beach as there are lots of job openings their but, if you just want to get in then their looking for a quality control person. That's if you want to travel that far I know someone that works there he can help you out. Good luck sean how you find work soon.
Dear Ryan, Please do How to be Emo 2.0 please?
Please do a 'cooking but not really' while he's still here. PLEASE.
Bring back parkourse 😅😅
Hello, people listening to podcast could you answer one quick question for my project assignment about podcasts, please. What kind of value do you get from listening to podcasts?
Paco radio voice is frikin sexy lmao
I really miss him...he's too cute now...May he get a job job
I swear u are the funniest most creative youtuber on this platform. Keep it up man(ps love the frequent uploads)

I agree with everyone when it comes to relationship!
glad Ryan is doing what he likes. So far I’m enjoying all his new content and I think it’s good that he’s showing his own side
Have Jenna Marbles on the podcast
Come to Seatlle Sean!
Come and work in Oklahoma! They have alot of engineering jobs!
12:40 LOL, it’s augmented reality, not artificial reality. (Artificial reality does sound better tho)
I’m in Sacramento and may have a few connections
I like Paco being the moderator of the podcast. He just seems so naturally on point with it, no hate to Will, but Paco is just so natural about it
My relo advice is-> fights, between two RATIONAL people, 99.9% happen due to miscommunication or misunderstanding and once you can (or both) objectively figure what it was and be able to apologise and maybe figure out a way to prevent it happening again. Plus fights are hard, but if you have the commitment to SO and the relationship, you'll work through it and come out stronger on the other side (cliche but true, swear). But then also different strokes for different folks, so if smth works out for your relo then go with it, just my two cents. And then also as they said trust and communication is key. Coming from 3 year relo and going into second year of LDR. GL to all and loving the podcast !!
OMG PACO I LOVE YOUR HUMOR :P
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion sad song in that female voice of yours
Dear Ryan can you make an apex legends  trailer
Damn, I relate to Sean so much rn. I am currently getting my engineering degree (in second year) and trying to find a summer job, but everyone is smarter than me and I worry I'm not gonna find anything. I've basically heard from everyone in engineering that if you don't find a job in the summer after you complete your second year, it's gonna be hard to find a 12-16 month internship after your third year. And if you don't have that internship after your third year, good luck finding a job because no one is gonna want you after you graduate... >.<
Good luck job hunting Sean! it's a tough cold world out there... it took my husband about 8 months to find a job in his field when we moved to a new city, and so to make ends meet he did part time work and then was a sushi chef for a bit, which he actually really enjoyed. But hang in there!
Ambiversion is a real thing!
Sean!!! Miss you Bro😢 You are Ryan's better half❤🤗
life sucks dude, just get alotta connections and you can just sleep well but you're fine because one day you'll be called for some good shit and suddenly your life is perfect already
We missed you sean 😭😭
Dear Ryan Can you make a new song with BgA
Get Hyan Riga on the show.
Now that’s it’s over I have depres- sean
Ryan, your camera looks a little wonky. Sean and Paco's cameras were good, but whenever it switched to yours it looked a little blurry and out of focus
Sean I missed you
Sean is in Town
Sean is in Town
Nananananananana
Sean is in Town
I always thought daina was awesome.
Can we honestly have all of RHPC in one podcast and just see what happens?
Yo mister nigahiga u remember when u made that how to be a ninja video like... 11 years ago?
Dear Ryan, can you make a funeral full of spoons and forks?
Can we get Helga Fontanilla in the podcast?
Ryan was right, the main character in Bleach is called Kurosaki Ichigo and as Paco said ichigo means strawberry
When you realise nigahiga is the 69th most subbed channel
I just love listening to you guys talk about life and random stuff. It’s more real than like a staged video. It’s great
Christina Grimmie... RIP
Everyone tweet Niko Omilana and tell him to get on the podcast
What kind of engineering job? I'm in Sac area
Paco doing his part.
You guys got a rodecaster? Wow!
In my experience, trying to start open conversation with people just gets you yelled at and pushed away. I guess it's like pigeon in that the other person has to do it with you. I've honestly just been left bitter and not wanting to see people.
My favourite podcast episode so far! Loved the honest open conversation. You guys know the analogy of the iceberg, where what we see above the water is only a small percentage of what’s below the water. I was reminded of it when the conversation went to ‘headlines’/‘fake news’ etc. Really important for us to read more/find out the full story before jumping to conclusions. Anyway, keep doing what you’re doing!!!
I'm 15 yo and I think watching this show is useful for my future because I don't have to had a bad experience and learn from it, just watch other and learn to not had a the bad experience in life
1:33:56 played it back like 10 times 😂😂😂😂
Damn Sean, I totally understand that finding a job. It’s tough! I hope you find one soon! Bay Area is usually a good start, but super expensive.
I literally dont even watch tv anymore
Robin Williams killed himself because he had parkinsons and he was already about to die before it. I had searched it up a few months ago.
And he was so nervous for doing something different, I love this!
This podcast feels so honest and real and I really love it
Cable kart!
agree with the other comment- bring arden on the show! :)
yup its all connections.
SEANNNN ISSSSS BACKKKKKK YAYYYYY THE ICONIC DUO 👏👌💯 I admire the close friendship between yall two. Its nothing but true & real. I love how time doesn't affect your friendship but strengthen it :') If that's not goals, then I don't know what is.
Dear Ryan, can you make a video about iPhone vs Android
i love these podcasts so much!! keep them up!
damn life is rough D: good luck to everyone trying to do something.
I am a simple man. I see Sean in thumbnail. I click out out of my assignment and into the like button.
ryan agreeing with the long distance relationship talk 😏😏😏
I want an hour+ deep convo with Paco. He getting deep DEEP in the thoughts man.
The beginning is meme review
Ryan higa should host meme review😂😂
I relate to Paco, I also want to feel like that😂
Wait, am I the only one who would’ve never thought Ryan is introverted?? 😂
And actually there is a personality test you guys can take, where it gives you a percentage of e.g. how extroverted or introverted you are - it said I was 82% introverted, and I can’t really argue with that 😅😂
I CLICKED RIGHT WHEN I SAW SEAN
Paco used to be the serious one.
Sean is back!!
Dallas has a lot of Engineering opportunities, hope you already found a job though
Damn. ive been watching you since the "how to" videos. Im loving these podcasts. i feel like it shows a different side of you. Also for me it seems like You want to have REAL conversations and use your influence to DO GOOD and that one guy always turns it into comedy. Im sorry but i really feel like he doesnt get most of the ideas you and Sean throws around and the other dude either butt in completely missing the point or throws around ideas he heard on the internet.  continue on with your visions man. stop being too nice. Im pretty sure you wont even see this so EYYYYY.
Meme review 👏👏is like a late late night show but bigger.
         - Ryan Higa 2019
Best tip I've ever gotten, take the photo like you're taking a selfie so they think you're just taking a selfie when you're really taking a pic of them
Great podcast 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Get Kevjumba on boyyyy!!!
Dang I admit, I was bouncing...
55:00 Ryan and Sean just made me remember that i haven't spoken to my best friend in over a year.
Hey Ryan I wanted to ask if u could make videos like anime in real life and how to hide your farts
Sean Why did you leave 😥😥😥
as a girl, i can confirm that we don't poop
If Seans wanting to stick into engineering I suggest he applies to jobs in Huntsville, AL. Its basically the engineering Mecca. The only job you CAN get here is engineering. So frustrating sometimes.
I love pc-ness of the week.
Haha Paco is hilarious! And Paco; hint hint I’m single too ;))
Wait does paco mean hentai?
Thanks for telling me about bananas. Never would have bought them if it weren’t for you
I did the bouncy thing lol 😂
Inazuma eleven
This is the most words Sean said in his whole YouTube career.
I guess bye bye for quality vids
This podcast is actually really interesting to listen to.
Shawn? No,  it's Sean. English is odd
Hopefully a couple summer's of work is enough for me
Vaping can deliver nicotine to your brain
Oh wait, there was an actual ad during shi shi break.
Ryan “sponser us” higa
i actually do have to poop after trying the bounce
It's scary tbh...It surprises me that even engineers are having a tough time with employment. If that's the case then what about people who majored in non-STEM?  That's going to be competitive as hell. Anyway, STAY STRONG SEAN AND STUDENTS!
I don't know if this ia TMI but I tried the bouncing and clockwise stomach tricks JUST out of curiosity. It worked. WAY too well! Maybe I ate something that caused it ... but wow! Umm thank you, I think?
This seems like a really deep podcast.
59:54 Ryan's laugh is so cute,
Sean has such a soft, calming voice,
Paco's ranting is so relatable
Can you bring back parkourse please
59:00 I think those types of Manga are called Edo. Did I get that right?
I actually do the rub clockwise to help my baby poop
YAY SEANS BACK :D
you can tell how much happier and actually excited to create stuff ryan is now since hes uploading way more frequently and trying out new ideas
Man I love these keep pumping out if it's not too much of a hassle!
Have you Sean yoshi's fuji.
I'm addicted to these podcasts when I didn't think any podcast was interesting. I can relate to the things they are talking about because I'm very close to their age and I'm highly interested in what Ryan Higa's life relates to the topics they talk about.
I forgot to follow you on twitter..iJust did it I hope I followed the real Higa.
Seans speaking like he's about to cry over his job and it's gonna make me cry :(

Edit: thanks for the tips, I'm looking to become an architect.
Dude Paco needs to be a regular cause he does the best segways. When a topic is getting tired he just knows when to end it.
You should timestamp your podcasts
I totally relate to the job thing T_T help please ;;;;
I dare you shave off Greg’s moustache and eat it.
the difference of an introvert and an extrovert is where you get your energy from. If you feel more recharged being alone then you're an introvert. it doesn't mean introverts can't socialize, it just means it could be draining to socialize.
Dear Ryan can you do triple backflips and landed on a skateboard
"people be paper chasing" XD
0:48 When Ryan pointed and said "We have a new thing..." I thought he was referring to Paco as a joke xD
dear ryan help pewdiepie stay ahead of series (in subs)
We need Jenna and Julian on the podcast! Talk about ghost stories, and conspiracies! :D
paco’s laughter at 58:51 made my day
Dear Ryan can we please get dtrix, jerel, or green on one of these podcasts I feel like it would be serious and hilarious
Can we just take a second to appreciate how nice that thumbnail looks?
Compromise only works if the other person is reasonable, if the other person defends their stand without budging, you have to go after them. That’s politics anyways, the existence of check and balances.
This just cured my depreSEAN
PLEASE NEVER END THESES I LOVE THEM
Paco - “It’s SO BORING” LOL
Sean is back 😝
Bananas are my favorite fruit lol 🍌🍌
Dear Ryan, can you make a Harry Potter Parody ?
26:00
36:00
Came here to laugh, gained knowledge and wisdom
Dear Ryan,
Can make a action story only using tomatoes
My aunt is an anchor for Fox up in Sacramento, she probably has connections that could be useful to you
1:14:09 
Paco: I’m right, you’re wrong..
Me: Shut u- oh wait wrong channel
Ryan and Sean just seem like really kind people, especially how they interact with Paco's relationship story
Where has Derrick been lately?
“Artificial Reality”
megan batoon for a potential guest?
pewdiepie on off the pill, please?
What field of engineering is Sean in or interested?
Love these podcasts!
im sponsering you ryan
omg the numbing thing works
You guys should just tell the companies that Sean made the Nintendoe paper and the Cardboard. And boom! Every engineering firm would love to have him
Hmmmm is it ok that I always imagine Nigahiga to be bottoming for me??
Please help us with article 13
Can u do parkourse plsss ❤️❤️❤️
Please make another video with Sean while he is here
Come to the UK where there are apprenticeships
share it with the class!
wait who is Kristina and what happened?
Can't wait for Ep. 4
Hey Ryan I don’t know if you read comments or not and I don’t think you’ll  see this however, I have ADHD and I was diagnosed fairly late so I struggled a lot going through school because of this, I’m turning 16 in a month and I was only diagnosed a year ago anyways I’m off topic. I take “the pill” and I just love watching your videos and how confident you are about talking about adhd and I have questions about the meds
1) What is your medication called and how big is the dose? 
Mines 36mg and I take concerta XL
2)What’s it like taking meds as an adult and do you recommend doing it? 
3) How often do you take your meds as an adult?
4) What do you take your meds for? Like do you try to take them everyday even if you aren’t doing anything, or do you take them for driving or if you go out to social events? 
Thanks Ryan I love your videos and have done for ages and I love that you talk about your controversial views because you are honest and real and I really respect that so thank you 
Keep up the amazing work and I really hope you see this comment
Post these on spotify please
sean's comesback
I can relate to Sean, it’s so hard to find a job when they want experience and I don’t have any experience because i couldn’t fin a job for experience.
Paco!! Your advices are the things I see online haha! Jk but some I’ve read online.
Guess who's back
back again
Sean's back 
tell a friend..
Imagine the people that were at that buffet watching this video
please do a podcast in just pidgin LOL
pc=politically correct?
SEAN IS BACK!!!! WOOOO!!! SEANS IN TOWN~!!!!
Sean is in town, Sean is in town, everyone’s happy because Sean is in town


(Sing that to the “David’s in Town” song)
likes a ketchup bottle guys
28:00 I heard lately that James Charles had people showing up to his house- which he avoided showing from the outside. I think that we have to respect celebrities as people and respect privacy of their home and enjoyment of their lives, which I would include eating in public.
I love naruto too 💗
Could you guys please talk about the  “wake up YouTube” hashtag on your next podcast? I don’t think the message behind it is fair to all, but I would really like to hear about it from you guys.
When the lil swaying things behind Ryan get out of sync
Its not david’s in town anymore, its now sean’s in town
Dear rayin can you can you blow my mind
you should make a how to rap like your favorite rapper  and ayyyee sean
SEEEEEEAAAAANNNN IS HERE

OOOGAAA BOOOGAAA

Anyways how was your day?
Dear Ryan, if you were a girl in another universe, draw that person’s life
Yo deadass, can we get KevJumba on this PodCast please?
I loveeeee you so muchhhh Sean!!
I love Paco's sense of humor!!
At this point the podcast is just everyone disagreeing with Paco
Ryan, I know EXACTLY what you're talking about with different pooping techniques. "The Belly Rub" and "The Jiggle" were common on my wrestling team, but I did what I called "The Tummy Tenderizer." I basically just stand up and quickly jab my stomach with both hands extended like anime knife-hands over and over. To me, it simulates both "The Belly Rub" and "The Jiggle."
we missed u sean
You guys were right about communication with trump, thats how I deal with hard to deal with people.
dear ryne are from hong kong
The audio is really good in these videos
Dear ryan make a drawing of kakashi sensei from naruto
Even years after Christina's death, my heart is still broken. It's so weird thinking that she started on YouTube and that you guys even met her. I saw her at a concert when I was 13 and fell in love with her music. Still miss her. Though it was hard to listen to, I'm glad you guys talked about that.
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion song in that female voice of yours
Dear Ryan, could you do hay day to a horror movie trailer?
Fellow nine year olds won’t understand this whole convo, but I really enjoy these topics and podcast videos! Kudos to y’all! I also hope that Sean gets a job that he enjoys. :)

Edit: The whole nine year old shit was a joke but ok... my point is that I rly like these podcasts. :P
Ryan Higa Please help PewDiePie beat T-series
You could get more a specific engineering degree, or get a minor or certificate
the dancing thing behind Ryan is distracting me.. 😅😅😅
KORE WA NAN DESU KA?!
Next OTP Podcast Ryan Sean Paco Pewdiepie
The audio is faster than the video
Funny thing a lot of people probably aren’t living in the first world listening,  and this may be one of the few pleasures they are afforded.
The bouncing worked!!
Top 10 anime bromances reunited
It would be nice if yo guys could call swoozie for a podcast.
Bouncing made me fart
Paco loves harem anime... I see you're a man of culture.
Fujiyoshi sounds like it could be sushi
Petition for Elon Musk to hire Sean
Im a 49ers fan too... im so sad
I want to be an engineer so when I grow up I will move to California and you can give me a job
Please caption your off the pill videos, many thanks!
"THERE WAS NINE" 😂😂😂😂
I’m loving this new content. I’m not as young as I once was (been watching you guys since I was little so I grew up with you guys) and so it’s nice to see content that isn’t geared towards little kids / young young adults
Jesus Christ this was depressing
be paper.
bring Arden to the showww
Man I have so much more respect for Paco, he’s so insightful and the way he keeps and starts conversations just flows well
Do more podcast
When will skitzo be back
paco watches hentai
Dear Ryan , can you show everyone and Sean the primitive epic snow building you and Greg made and have them stay there for a while living off of it
NO I love will’s “GET EM!”
Me, listening to it in the background: ...... DID I HEAR BLEACH????
Yey seans back in other video
Every second of 1:35:53 was worth watching
I got an ad at the shi shi break. Did anyone else?
Real guys talking about real things
shi shi omg hahahahahahahahhahaha classic for an asian
I miss him😊
I agree with this so much. The media has become very manipulative. It shouldn’t be us vs them, but that’s what it’s become and the media is right there egging it on.

SEAN'S BACK BITCHES!
Dear Ryan, make the life of an airpod
i wish someone had also told me to try really hard to get an internship when i was still in college...i did communications as my major which is also really broad and covers a lot of things but it's super hard to get a job without experience. i wish you luck Sean!
Kostas P
Dear Ryan, can you do a dear Ryan with a nice guys parody

It can go like this, White guys finish last that’s why I’ll treat you like black it’s not what I really want to do but you only date black guys so I’ll give it my best try to paint me the way you want me to.
christina grimmie :(
Paco looks so big compared to Ryan and Sean
Ryan, te amo. Eres muy inteligente y bien hablado 😽
You three look extra handsome today aww
Can you bring in Tiffany Young for a video???
Gasp  ITS SEAN!!!
Now it's the time to learn AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, InfraWorks...
Ay I live near Sacramento
Dam Ryan looking like a snacc
Why is Sean a guest
Podcast with KSI?
I spent the first 4 minutes reading a conversasean of sean puns
We watch ur videos all the time
These podcasts are so chill and it is really nice that you tackle these subjects and you are clear about what you think. I hope you continue doing them, as long as you want of course, and you keep having fun😊
Is it possible to make how to be ninja 3.0?
Do a video about Dana!
love paco. those harem series, childhood.
I Don't think people just eat up clickbait-y headlines and believe them; it's just that because we see it as a news headline, we believe that that's how it spreads. It doesn't stay that way. Someone always notices and points it out and then that spreads too and it gets nullified. Most people Are rational and will care about the truth and get to it eventually
Ryan-“I was less lost today”
-The power of Sean

Dang Paco, that was an impressive radio voice 😯👏🏽
What does PC stand for?
Paco, the nine-year-old army is a joke because the media always says that his fans are that young when in reality most of them are around your age or a bit younger.
anyone else wanna see jenna and julian on the podcast? im sure it was already suggested but hey
I think they are not as close as they were the last time...what happened? I want to know if you are still close friends....
This is how good this podcast is
👇
unpopular opinion: Paco seems much better suited for podcasts
DO A PODOCAST WITH JENNA AND JULIEN
I honestly love these. They're voicing their thoughts so genuinely. I'm a girl and I love listening to these! Especially about PC culture, I feel like they have an understanding that goes far beyond most people in these things. I'm pretty active myself in these topics, but have always tried to appeal to both sides (though if I'm being honest, I lean towards leftists way more often than I do not), and STILL have learned things just by listening to you guys. Speaking the truth! I've watched you guys for so many years (although not as faithfully the last year-and-a-half or so because it didn't feel as real, and I can see why now), and never plan to stop. :)
HAS ANYONE SEEN SEAN?!
It's called a hentai harem. And it's art.
Remember in 2007 ryan  was the best youtuber in the world
A random sub
do your part damit !
YAY SEAN IS BACK FOR THIS AT LEAST!!❤️❤️🧡💚💜💙🖤💛
Dear Ryan Can You fall in love with sock
Can we got Dtrix next?
You three guys were good on this one! That Paco pose tho

Yo i love sean and all but paco is GOAT on these podcasts
i like how they made the sound check the intro.
Shawn is back
Dear Ryan, can you invite KevJumba to your podcast?
I miss your old vids.
Bring arden next timee
Please do more!!!
you can tell paco is a freshman and ryan and sean both seniors just disappointed in paco
No one's gonna address that Ryan is so Out of Focus?
Be paper <3
I like how we're actually getting uploads now, keep up the good work
Please tell me ya'll did a cooking but not really
Yeah yeah i love these podcasts
Sean again!
Is sean back yass
SEAAANNN!!!!
Money cant buy happiness but it can provent sadness
Dear Ryan, can you make a video about revealing all your friends’ secrets?
Why does Ryan look so diff
wait whats sponsering
I have that type of friendship too
Thanks Sean  
Sean’s in town Sean’s in town everyone sing because Sean’s in town
Why does he sound so depressed
I love Paco's laugh
My suggestion is to get Pewdiepie on the podcast
Dear Ryan , where are r -dizzle, hanate and Regina
I LOVE DAINA!!!
Unrelated comment: PLEASE BRING BACK COOKING BUT NOT REALLY!
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion song in that female voice of yours
I really enjoy this podcast, it gives me a little look into everyone's minds. Thanks for starting it!
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion song in that female voice of yours
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion song in that female voice of yours
Dear Rayn can you sing xxxtentacion song in that female voice of yours
ARE THEY EVER GONNA TALK ABOUT ARDEN
Appreacia-Sean
Does anyone remember Ryan and Sean’s not so excellent adventure?
Dear Ryan, can you freestyle rap with only puns without autotune
how to pronounce nigahiga?
I’m still in college and I can’t do a couple hours.... hahaha
Love these podcasts! Keep it up
Good luck with your job search Sean! Have you considered starting your own engineering related project? I can’t recommend much as I too am a mechanical engineer but from Australia. At my university it’s compulsory to complete 60 days+ of industry experience to graduate as an engineer.
tbh i do shake my body to try to poop and i get what sean and ryan are trying to say ahahahaha
DearRyan , can you make a trailer of Apex Legend ? pleasssssse
I understand where Sean is coming from. I’m in school but it’s difficult to get an internship. But it’s SO worth it, even if it’s unpaid, the experience itself is what matters.
39:55
the 9 year old meme, I don't think Ryan and Sean got it and Paco is not explaining it properly.
Basically pewds was doing a video on eye tracking and he looked at twitch thot clips, then Alinity saw that video and proceeds to copystrike his video just because she didn't like the word "twitch thot"
She goes on and brag about how much money collabdrm sent her, and how they are just easy money. So of course the entire internet laughed at her because for one, she is a twitch thot, and second of all, another one abusing the the broken copyright system youtube has. After criticisms she then cried about pewd's audience, in her own words, the "literal 9 year olds" harassing her. And that brings us to now, the 9yo army.
Wait.. SEEEEEAAAANNNN!!!!
dear ryan can you make an overwatch parody?
Arden on a podcast?
These podcasts are so calming, informative and interesting. I really love how you guys aren't afraid to go into controversial topics, unlike many other podcasts. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK ILY
Y'all need to get pewdiepie on here 👀
Please show us the bouncy!!!!!!! I'm so desperate pllssssss
Sean just take Paco with you
SO happy to see Sean!
I love how Sean said "Hentai" so innocently 58:36
I'm a mechanical engineer that will be graduating soon too.. however, getting a job is hard. Therefore, I'm going back to school.
SEAAAAAAN!!!!! WE MISSED U SO MUCHHHH
i completely understand that introverted and extroverted problem with getting a job cause ive had trouble getting interviews and the rare ones that i did get they rejected me saying im not suited for the job cause they need people who are more social and out there (i got rejected by maccas (mac donalds) just to put it in perspective) im 100% introverted with no extroverted things at all like i get burned out after a couple minute of socializing with people and i remember that a couple years ago i tried to be extroverted but all that did was make my social anxiety, depression and agoraphobia really worse, to the point where i was seriously considering suicide or dropping out of school. I'm still not as mentally sane or healthy as i was before i tried that and its already been almost 3 years now so i guess my advice is that you can try but if its really hard for you then just take a break rather than pushing yourself too far
How do they not have a sponsor yet
crab man
Did not expect to learn how to poop
Yay Sean Fujeeyooshaaiiii  😭😭😭😭
Other YouTubers: Works 30 mins for a 10 min video
Ryan: Works 3 days for a 10min video
Anyone else find the noise really satisfying?? 🤷‍♀️
They should've carved 'TEEHEE' on a rock so people (in the future) will know that a youtuber in the past made it. 😂
I love how he never gives up on what he starts, he puts in so much effort and time for us. Thank you Ryan, you are the most greatest YouTuber ever!
I think you’ve unintentionally made an ASMR video... 🤔
I like the part where Ryan and Greg just started running into the wall
Do any of you people remember when he was the most subscribed channel on YouTube
I’d say that cost 1.2 million nice location, good community
Tbh I didn't believe they would ACTUALLY make a fort lol, I just thought they would do some funny sh!t xD
The amount of dedication ryan and his team put into their videos is INSANE.  I love it omg
Ryan Tries = Ryan does something, but way more than you expected
most famous youtuber who doesn't ask for subs lol
The part where they started running into the snow cracked me up🤣
Lowkey I feel like Ryan is stepping up his game. Not like his videos weren’t 10/10 before but now he’s actually being... p r o f e s s i o n a l 👀
We asked for a fort not a WHOLE FREAKING CASTLE, damn
I thought you guys were kidding... I was wrong
Forget pewdiepie this guy should have more subscribers than T-series
Other Youtubers:- Tries Indian food
Ryan Higa:- Tries building a snow fort 
Builds!
Petition for Ryan to start a primitive technology channel?
this vid makes me wanna play minecraft
those sped up tapping sounds is the key to a primitive building video.
When they made the frickin wood basket just to carry snow when they're already surrounded by snow lol🤣👌
Ryan: *pats snow*
Me: "are you going to to talk?"
Ryan: *patting of snow intensifies*
ASMR taken to a whole other level
I love how they even got the sound effects right haha
This was the most epic fort I’ve ever seen
Don't ask me why, but this is the cutest video I have ever seen
Ryan never age😌😌😌😌

He's immortal 😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱
Long time very very good friend, Gregory... I thought he was gonna say Sean. I'm too hopeful.
From day 2 to 3. Why Ryan sleeps at the right side an woke up on the left side?😂🤔
Wow Greg getting screen time?
Ryan really is changing his content 😂
omg this was so great. Ryan and Greg you guys are incredible. this whole team
quality content
so inspiring
makes me wanna make my own
except wait.
I hate snow.
That stick basket was hella innovative bro, like that was the smartest sht
Wow the new Minecraft update looks epic!





Note: it’s a joke
This guy actually took a dump in a dang snow toilet 🚽
Came to see something funny, going with being amazed after watching Ryan & Greg build a genuinely EPIC fort
Man it looks so satisfying to play with snow. I always wondered what it felt like.
(It doesn't snow where I am 😢)
2:44 was that fall supposes to happen 😂😂
WOOOOOOOW IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT PRETTY AWESOME GUYS!!! GREAT JOB!!! 😲👍👏👏👏
So creative and smart! And so freaking funny...........
I thought this was going to be a joke but holy crap that turned out great!!!
Dang... All of us just watched 2 adults build a snow fort
This is almost more satisfying to watch then Bob Ross
They did such an amazing job
Dear Ryan, Please make pun video on paradoxes.
And then.. Ryan realises he forgot to turn on the camera
I feel like I'm watching snowday the prequel to building their snow fort 👏
2:44 i lost it when Greg fell 😆
And Ryan gives him the "stop fooling around look"
1:04
   How do you sweat in  the coldest climate
4:47 you two are soulmate waking up in the same time
I thought this was a joke video but it turned out to be sick 😂
I thought this was satire....
Until I finished watching.
At first, I thought he was gonna make really funky stuff. 
However, in the end, he really put a lot of effort into building it.
Last week I made a mini slide and I felt like the best person in the world 





About 
No eating?
This is the weirdest ASMR video I’ve ever seen
hahaha

DJing
Robot Fighting 
Ghost Hunting 
Sword Fighting

@dearryan

New Series!!! OH YEAAAAH~.
 
GREAT JOB AS ALWAYS .
dude the thumbnail was way worse than the final product it was like reverse click bait
Hahaha😂😂😂when they were slamming into the ice wall for the slide I died
Gregory looks like Franklin with a beard in GTA 5
Looks cool, but I was really missing the subtitles
I swear, one of them has a degree in architect and the other graduated from Boy Scouts
So this is what Ryan meant by doing something he enjoys...






G E N I U S
didnt even make the twine yourself..
Who else is dying for more eps. Of Ryan tries? Ik I am
This was truly epic good job guys you are really huge inspirations on this platform
9:20 to 9:22 what a magic. 😂 Amazed
And btw nice video as always 😍
The sheer dedication
Mad props Ryan
This should be "Building a snow fort ASMR"
Who likes before even watching? Cuz I just did
Thanks you so much for this everlasting entertaining video from you....

Just love how creative and how supportive your friends be...absolutely the BEST person I ever find in the whole youtube...

Thumns up👍👍👍👍
Applause~~~~👏👏👏👏👏
literally just got done with watching one and I find this
Petition for this series to be call : Just Tryan
Imagine on day 3 there is a heat wave and all the snow melts
How I climb up the mountain 2:45 XD
Hey! Boyscout here. Outdoor survival is basically one of the biggest parts if Boyscouts, so the fact that you did good by Boyscout standards is great! I was honestly impressed by you hard work and perseverance. Good job!
Ryan tries not to smile during a 10 minute video
Did anyone else start dying when they started slamming into the wall LOL
7:05 I love how they switched places HSHSHSH
Wait a minute... Where did they get the mold to make those perfectly ice cream bucket shaped snow bricks?🤔...
The more accurate title would be: Minecraft IRL: Building a snow fort! (NOT CLICKBAIT) (WE ALMOST STARVED)
Me: Do you wanna build a snowman?

Ryan: BUILDS AN ULTIMATE SNOW FORT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY SELL FOR MORE THAN MY HOUSE!

Me: ....okay bye......
Their lack of emotion while building that amazing fort just makes this the perfect video
You tubers: let’s live in the woods and make a house!

Ryan:hold my beer
AWESOME! Nigahiga "Eskimo" Edition.
It hurts to think that it’s all melted by now
Sometimes what I do with all this, to video for the sake of commenting even though I have nothing to comment about so I guess I'm commenting about the lack of me being able to find original comments or make original comments actually so yeah
My god, 6 videos within 2 months?!? It's great to see that Ryan is more active now compared to last year
omg this is actually amazing  :D
Love love love Ryan and RHPC💜
That’s true ASMR right there.
funny thing is I discovered those primitive survival vidoes hours ago then i just saw thus video right now well played youtube rrcommendation
and yet they can still be funny even without talking
ASMR with Greg and Ryan
I LOST IT WHEN GREG ROLLED DOWN THE HILL
I thought u did this already
7:00 anyone notice they switched places when they woke up? X'D
This was a very strange experience but also very impressive, I didn't expect that kind of dedication, but hey! THAT'S RYAN!
With every inch of daylight we have, we're gonna be BEWding
7:00 they switch positions overnight (I think a discontinuity joke done on purpose)
wow! I'm mind blown! Mad props to Ryan, Greg the rest of RHPC!!
you missed something the other youtubers did... 
in their primitive building vid's they only wear short's thats all. No socks, no coat, no nothing but shorts.
All jokes aside, this was actually a really interesting video
In 2050 there gonna be like "On to today's news is a strange primitive snow fort it seems"
this acc turned out really good
Title shoulda been 
*MINECRAFT HIGH QUALITY SNOW FORT
3:05
OMG I SHIP THEM
The snow was a paid actor
In100
 years that be a sign of life
Continuity boys, I saw the side flip between night two to day three. Gotcha :)
this is actually pretty impressive
From 2:00 I legitimately was cracking up for the next 2 mins
I was expecting this to be cheesy, but this is actually amazing.
Dat fire sequence tho xD
Brilliant!
2:44 cant stop laughingggg😂😂😂😂
Idk why I watch those kind of video but when ryan did it it's just funny for no reason 😂😂
2:43 I love how he just starts working down there😂
God bless ryan higa and his friends for making actual GOOD CONTENT for the past 13 years
My Mom: Go outside and be creative.

Me:
this video should just be called snow ASMR
PATTING INTENSIFIES
That is some amazing effort!
I cant wait for the behind the scenes of this
Snow fort building ASMR
waiting for other channel to update
comes across this video
Oh, woah hey I haven't watched Ryan,s videos for two years
clicks on video
Ha why did Greg haul all the heavy stuff
The patience and dedication they have for this... 😂😂😂😂
I love the background music
Forever my fav youtuber. NEXT LEVEL!
Technically they did use a tool (string) but still really good
Commitment!!!
All these comments praising Ryan, not one for Greg... :(
This is soooooooo amazing ommmggg! Ryan you are  GENIUUUUSSSSS! I WILL NEVER STOP SAYING THAT!! ❤️🔥 You probs didn't even know you were making a dope ASMR video with those sped up sounds 😂👌🏼🔥


I LOVE RHPC❤️❤️❤️
This was also pretty funny too😂. You guy's faces
Why is this so on point yet hilarious and magnificent at the same time??
I love this video ♥️
Now this is commitment I thought this was gonna be a joke 😂 mannnnn they actually did it
excellent video! I'm excited to see more Ryan tries :) you guys work so hard for each video it's incredible!
When I watch these type of vids I cringe so HARD 😆
Gotta make sure it's aesthetically pleasing :P
DAMN SON THIS IS REALLY GOOD!
Ryan, the only youtuber who can make people laugh without even saying anything
This is hilarious... and the sped up sounds got me with them falling 😂
Use builder pro next time
This is like snow ASMR
Try putting snow in a rectangle container to make bricks for ur next snow fort 🙂👌🏽
Dude vs Wild - Arctic #2 didn't disappoint
I end up laughing at this part 2:44 so badly!! XD (sorry Greg XD)
Love the fact you guys swap places in day 3 XD
That's sick bro, how on earth did you make such an awesome fort, GG
If these two men can do this without anyone knowing(until the upload of course) just imagine the government
wow this is more entertaining than you would think! (to the people scrolling down the comments)
Have a nice day...?

Edit: HOLY POO ONE OF THE TOP COMMENT AND A HEART THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!! <3<3<3<3<3
Idk why but whenever i see them do somethinb i just laugh...
That’s the snow ❄️ base that you want to hide in while you are in a snow ⛄️ fight 🤣
I wish every upload in this channel fall under 'RYAN TRIES'
Rubbing the stick 
Magic
🔥
did anyone else get satisfied by the vigorous patting
Ryan and Gregory are TELLETUBBIES. XD
oh my gosh. the tower for the camera got me laughing so hard
Are they making the elza's castle in frozen? XD
The lack of emotion tho! 👌
Even with no Voice is still funny 😆
Day 2-3 they swap sides between day and night😂
Can you do makeup without using any kind of mirror .. 😁😋
It took them three days....




It would have taken me three years, good job Ryan and Greg!!!
The noise i can't  take it 😂😂
Ofcourse, it's a satire, silly me thinking Ryan is serious this time..
Btw:would love to see the bloopers
Did they eat?
I am worried for their stomach.
Are you sure this isn’t an ASMR video?
Lol
I literally could not look away from this lol. mesmerizing
It's a legit 10 minutes ASMR vid
The only time I'm glad there's an ad in a video.
Why did I suddenly imagine future archaeologist discovering this primitive building after an apocalypse destroyed all other previous historical evidence, along with a montage of them studying/believing it's a legit building?
WOW...
Simply put... Just WOW
I was not expecting this!
Wow, this was really freaking good. Even with the +already carved wood, and fire
Ryan: How should we make the snow more compact?
Greg: Lets body slam it.
Ryan: ...
Ryan: Sounds good, Lets do it.
It was soo awesome
Probably one of his best vids
I thought it was gonna be a troll video then he really did it for real 😅 freakin impressive
ULTIMATE FORT BUILDING CHALLENGE
Welp, now i now building snow men are difficult
The quality of Ryan’s content is actually unbelievable
lmao i never got this video on my subbox, and for some reason, it also marked the video as watched. I found the video after the second episode was released. wtf youtube?
This is the kind of stuff I always wanted to do as a kid.  Still wish I could.   Loved this video. :D
love how Ryan actually does what he puts on his clickbait style title
This is better than original primitive survival stuff
These guys have the most patience on YouTube 11/10
9:14 me in the last 5 minutes of exam
U do work really hard...hats off and  love from india....
How to make fire 9:16
Survival tip #1
Did i really watch a video with no talking for almost 10 minutes? 




Yes. Yes i did
This lowkey gave me minecraft vibes
Lol this is how ninja builds in fortnite
the thumbnail should have been the finished project, i would have watched it sooner if I knew it actually became something
WOWWWW 
SO NICE AT THE END THO
You guys looked like sims characters.
thank you so much for this vid, it made my year definitely
me like this




Edit:thank u for no likes😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
0:50
I felt bad for Greg
I highly suggest wearing headphones for this.
This legend didn’t put a ad at the 10 min mark... what a legend
I seriously loved this video so much, it was freaking cute. Idc what anyone says!
They were probably talking between camera cutz
Anyone else has seen that drone footage on pexels before 😅😅😅 ?
Well that's 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back 😑
I thought this would be some sort of clever Ryan clickbait but now I'm actually impressed. As usual.

Edit: I know Ryan doesn't clickbait. I'm just saying he is able to find another way around fulfilling promises made in his titles/ thumbnails wo actually doing what you expect aka he's clever. So yall can chill tf out.
And Welcome back to my minecraft channel Episode 28950 and now we are building forts with snow lets do this oh yeah i won't be talking too much because we are trying to do ASMR Snow Fort with No tools and No help from other people challenge i know that's a long title but i don't care because i don't give 2 f**ks now let the gameplay begins


(There i fix your intro for you)
9:36-The face of men who've just been in the snow for three days
I admit, I don't really watch Ryan's videos as much as I used to but when I see one, it always NEVER fails. Quality over quantity indeed! Amazing job to the whole team!
yall ever heard of asmr
itz good here
btw nice work man/mans
im jus a 13 year old kiddo in singapore with no snow
fml
The furniture inside the fort tho-
2:44 made me spill my ramen noodle soup
this video deserves a lot more views and likes :( what an amazing vid !
Pro tip.   Put the playback speed to .5x and you get a regular speed video
Still amazing! And still hoping for a BTS HAHAHAHA
The ASMR in this video is real
The most underrated video on YT
This felt weirdly relaxing to watch
How can you manage to not have conversation the entire time????
This got 100,000 more likes than Ryan's podcast
Youtube, can you please put this in trending
Edit: We finally made it to the trending page, YouTube is as bad as it used to be 👌
2:44 I WHEEZED 😂😂
You should change the series name to Ryan Tryn’
Rename this to Ryan Tries:ASMR
Okay I didn't expect it to actually be that cool looking XD
Let’s be honest, none of us expected it to be that good

Like can I buy it? Is it for sale?
Who was thinking about how they could survive without eating??




No one ;(
I’m beyond impressed 😳🤩👍🏽💜
dear ryan can you make are video about Papua New Guinea?? we are your biggest fans
Do a video with the try guys
The entire video I was expecting some kind of punch line to a joke or a pun but no, they actually build an epic snow fort! Ryan, diverting expectations since forever..
This channel is dying but we can save this by sharing ryans vids on our social media so go now and share this vid
Oh yeah yeah
The fire part was hilarious😂😂
More like Ryan Tries: ASMR
Hard to think that they spent 3 DAYS not talking to eachother
Never thought I'd sit through 10 mins of silence and love it
That’s was a good vid! I love ur channel please do more of “Ryan Tries”
I was laughing so hard when they were charging at the snow multiple times 😂
I can assure u, we surely are not... 😂
dang would've been perfect if the teehee was silent
Practically it's free real estate
U said no tools but why u uses hammer?
Why didn't I get a notification for this???
so thread, chainsaws/saws and a flint n steel are an exception the the "no tools" rule then...
Wow the trailer for the new minecraft version looks fun!
Its an ASMR video as well.
7:01 they switch places after sleeping 😂😂
Dang that was actually such a great video
This is fantastic. I am super impressed.
idk but i laughed at this so hard. omg <3
I thought this was a joke video but it turned out to be sick 😂
Walis and gromit vibes
Ryan Higa is the Number 1 on YouTube. :3
Notice how they wake up on opposite sides on day 3😂😂
Just imagine going up the mountain and finding this shit.
I cant believe how much work they put in there videos
asmr to the infinith(what?) level
Your work output is nuts!!!
that's actually so impressive for 3 days
This was actually impressive!!
Playing sims on fast foward
great news guys! i just found out what triggers my ASMR sense! thanks ryan
if only primitive  technology can react to this that'll be hilarious
Should've had the captions :(
Played Minecraft too much?
How did they get the rope if they were primitive.


But great vid.
This is actaully legit
I tried to keep a straight face but just ended up burst out laughing xD
This is Minecraft in real life.
omg when ryan just silently watched greg poop, as if hey do it all the time, ...i laughed so hard.
I was laughing pretty much the whole video
i loved this and at the same time i couldnt stop laughing at how fast they were moving, in silence hahahahahhah and when gregory fell XD
i can get use to it 
not talking
After a thousand years

Scientists: Is this a sign of an advance ancient civilisation
I liked their diet that's good.
And the fire part is 🔥
I miss shawn😭
Ryan u said no tools


but u didn’t mention a stick,your using a stick as your tool
tbh it kinda sounded like ASMR....
A new Ryan video series to add to all the ones he’s already made!? 

hell yes
they probaly had like 20 microphones attatched to them
wow this Minecraft texture pack has amazing graphics!
that is fucking epic, you are epic! :D
Jesus, I expected them to just make a pun or something, not make a million dollar base!
Ryan one of the Hardest Working Youtubers in the world
I love this fort, it looks awesome! The lack of emotion using it all at the end was the best part though.
I love how they didn't say anything yet still managed to make such good n funny content
That first scene with them making a camera stand...even though they already had a camera set up...😂😂😂 This is why I love Ryan’s videos.
100 years from now, show them this video
Underrated: The snow tripod.
2:45 whee
Dear ryan, will you make the xblox video?
Press F for respect.
Hey u put in so much hardwork for this house/fort but when summer will come the ice will melt and the hardwork you've put will gone
Damn thats good fort. It has a toilet. Wahahaha
All from scratch, huh, mate? Where the hell did that string come from?! Lol
I love Tube Unique Wilderness!
this is secretly an ASMR video?
THIS WAS AMAZING!
The only asmr I'm willing to sit through
Watch 9:16 on 2x speed he’s literally the flash
Ryan really doesn’t  have to go that hard for us but he does, he does it for us
That’s actually sick. I WANT ONE
LOL WHERE IS JSTUSTUDIOS?!
This has to be the video in which Ryan spoke the least.
Make this a flipin series
We love and admire a hardworking content creator❤
2:44 🤣 I DIED😂😂😂😂😂
wait if they're in the wild how do they have a camera? and YouTube?
And all without talking. That's dedication.
Just subscribed!😀👍
How do I watch Ryan's older videos?
Imagine it raining while they were building it
9:13 elemental magic confirmed
I found it hilarious when they built the camera mount
plz let this become a tv show XD
Snow building ASMR?
He already failed the primitive building by talking
Imagine someone just walking around and coming across this...
did no joke seems quite the fun experience (granted if you had food and water)
Ohmygod, I love it.
That is incredibly impressive. * claps *
Loved the commentary of this video!!
No shade but the Try Guys could never
U guys literally killed bro ur too funny u guy held  hand an slam into the snow
Legend says, Ryan is still trying
Where do they live? Its beautiful
If you put playbackspeed at 0.25 all you can hear is decepticons talking
This was like watching 11 minutes of real life Minecraft. 😳
i was confused the whole video but i enjoyed it at the same time
🔥Epic🔥💯👍
Ryan tries ........






GG Ryan 
U did a gud job in trying hard
Ryan try to build a house in jungle (Ryan tries)
Everyone else: what they did was so counter-productive.
Eskimo: free real estate
Sounds like minecraft noises 🤔
They made a mistake cause on day three when they woke up Greg was on the side Ryan walked into
I watch the video in 0.75×
sometimes it baffles me how they could make such things and just end it with a 'teehee' in the final product
These minecraft mods keep getting better and better!
2:43 he looked like a rolly Polly falling
This is just an ASMR video.
you built a slide. you BUILT A BLOODY SLIDE.




now  ladies and gentlemen, is the quality videos I signed up for.
6:50 sounds like the devotion from apex legends and best asmr
did he just make an asmr video unintentionally
And then summer came along...
That’s honestly really impressive
Not one place protects you from rain aha
Noice
I can do better in building
And this ladies and gentlemen is what you call...







CONTENT!
No mid role adds I’m so DAMN PROUD OF YOU
2:44 I don’t know why it reminds me of a penguin
I'm honestly impressed.
at 7:00 u guys sleep Greg on the left Ryan on right but next day it’s the opposite lol
Damn the new Minecraft update looks great!
I know I'm late but did anyone else see the titles on the primitive vids. : ta outdoorbz
THIS IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ryan always proves that nothing is impossible.
That's actually good
Okay, now real question...how much for that?? Been looking around for a decent house.
I like the part when they got the sticks. Also the part when they pat the snow
The sound of the snow is cancer OMG XD
Nice drumming skills
Ryan can u do a two dabs while backflipping
Right... No tools. Somehow finds string and a chainsaw in the woods. Impressive snow fort regardless tho.
Why did this give me Minecraft vibes lol 😂😂
3 things i dont understand why 
1 why use wood and leaves
2 why fire in snow
3 why fake so hard
Ryan tried smoking weed.
I suppose if you're fine with crouching all the time, it's...well, at least there's a slide? jk, nice one guys.
180k likes omg
Now do it in Minnesota’s -60 degree weather
2:43 - 3:07 lmao😂😂😂
who else didnt fast forward at all
Why do you even need to build a snow fort when you can sleep out in the open on beds of snow on a winter's night?
Clearly the cold doesn't bother you anyway...
Well thats kinnda impressive
This had me deadlmao
Mahu hi mahu BY God what a brilliant fort
This is some nice ASMR if you are trying to go to sleep at night.
I laughed until the video was finished.
3:00
I would love to do that.
Do more Ryan tries
They did it incorrectly. They were supposed to be shirtless😂
I loved the vid plz make more bids about dis content
Sean would have been so proud if he was there.
At the very start when you’re making the perimeter of the house, you two look like little mice crawling around!!
This is so funny and therapeutic 😂
Dang that was so legit though, especially that table and hammer! Haha somehow the fast forward makes you guys look so cute working away. I felt a little bit like I was watching an episode of Pingu.
I laughed way too hard at this video, their faces!! 😂
Ryan Tries 5 is my favorite one
This reminded me of the three stooges.
Didn't eat once in 3 days



Gods.
ryan and his squad are too good at everything
This is exactly like one of the primitive videos 😂😂😂😂
This is the greatest YouTube video ever!
For a change I actually liked this video, wow man!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I thought it was going to be a joke but u guys actually did it👌😍
You and pewdiepie are one of the pinnacles of youtube. Here since how to be a ninja!!!
I’m glad that Ryan just does his own thing, and he doesn’t follow trends to the extent that other youtubers do. Ryan is original.
Did you actually sleep out there what?!
U should have made a Norte saying “ Nigahiga made this, so sub to him
Play it at 2x speed and you won't feel bored lol
MORE OF THIS!!!
Lol the time lapse made them act like hamsters in adderall.
Wow he's so good at lighting fires.
Did no one else notice that on the third day, they "woke up" on the opposite side? 6:58
This video needs 10M views. The content is on point 💯
Question





Were did y'all poop and pee and what did you eat
You should have brought Ryan higa from this great show called dude vs wild
Do more primitive building
On day 3 why did you guy switched places when you went to sleep
MTV cribs with Ryan Higa
They woke up switched places than when they went to sleep 7:08
Ryan really is the true entertainment on YouTube
This video seems sarcastic, and if so, what's your point?
“I miss Sean” -Ryan
Ryan tries, so we learn from his mistakes.
We are going to be doing so much carrying sweating and working until there is no more time for snowboarding this is why I love this man
Real Content; doesn't even have to ask for subs they just come to him.
Brings me back to when I was a kid watching pingu 😍
Greatest youtuber who ever lived
2:44 I CANT BREATHE 😂😂😂😂😂
Best YouTube channel..
Ryan: spends literal days making a huge snow fort 
Sun: whispers It's free real estate
You guys should have built a snow-fa
That is commitment right there.
I wonder.......if you can put this on air bnb xD
Speechless right now.
archaeologists 20 years later
a mysterious fortress has been found in the middle of nowhere. has been marked as alien territory.
9:26 when you're playing The Sims
Dear Ryan, join a marching band!!!!
I just realized day three they woke up on oposite sides
How did they wake up at exactly the same time
this video has a strange Pingu feeling to it
Thier Hard Work will be appreciated
Actually looks like one of those videos 😂
This is so amazinggggggg
He build that light by a stick after a    lighter
I swear u are the funniest most creative youtuber on this platform. Keep it up man(ps love the frequent uploads)
I don't know why but just the sound of them moving about sped up made me laugh!
the fire puts itself out
you used a rope to tie everything
9:42 definitely my favourite part
Dude after all these years you still come up with new and original content. You are pure talent!!!
2:45-3:05 felt like I was watching Charlie Chaplin. Xd
Ryan Tries: Bigfoot searching or any cryptid searching
Best frickin thing ive seen since i turned twelve
Hmmm... This new update in Minecraft is good, but I'll really miss the cubes
This im-
'RIght for the end of the video, we will now destroy our building, meaning we did this for nothing Greg...'
every time they tapped on the snow it sounded like happy feet
well done with fort  even tho u guys didnt really sleep there (: not trying to hate love u ryan
This is why I love Ryan. He puts so much effort into every single one of his videos and that is why he is one of my favorite YouTubers ❤️❤️❤️
Minecraft irl the game looks great
the house tour we always wanted, thanks ryan
This so Pro😂
(Dear ryan)  can you make a movie?
"oh...we forgot to press record"
greg falls killed me 😂😂 2:44
2:44 that fall🤣
HAHAH those are my brain cells doing math HAHAHA, i died laughing at 3:00 .
2:43😂🤣
will i ever watch a 10 minute silent video? yes. if its ryan and greg making a fort. 

IM SHOOK LIKE HOW DOES THIS GUY PRODUCE GREAT CONTENT EVERYTIME !!!
WOW 3 DAYS WITH NO WATER OR FOOD HOLY
I don't believe you slept outside without shelter lol
2:45 when Greg falls😂
Agents of secret of stuff?? part 2????
Imagine being on a hike with like 2 other people or something, and then you get lost, and you just find this snow fort randomly there
Wouldn’t the fire melt the snow?
Does Ryan pay his friends to help with videos cuz I wasn't doing this for free.
This is oddly relaxing
Thats actually impressive
this was lowkey an asmr video
Did they take a how-to-build-a-fort-primitive-style-in-less-than-3-days-without-saying-anything class because WHAT THE HECK
Now THATS EPIC
7:50 - 7:54 .. You took a chunk from your wall!
Anyone realise they switched spots when day 3 started
I can't be the only one who saw this and though "tryan"
you should have put commentary over the footage
this is really satisfying
;-;
Is just me or I feel like this is asmr...😂
His videos remind me of Phineas and Ferb. Ryan is so creative🤩
Yes funner is a word if it's coming out of Ryan's mouth
That was actually sick!!
Lies... I see a rope
I feel like he cheated somehow
My favourite part was when he made a primitive 4K camera with primitive batteries that last 3 days
Is it just me or does it sound like asmar
My piss will bring devastation to this fort
at 2:55 i cracked up
Amazing dedication.
The silence is so unsettling




I love it
Did you at least go snow boarding after?
why do I find this satisfying?
Make more videos like this not podcasts
What did just watch two flippin grown up's building a snow fort
Why isn't this trending yet?
This is actually pretty sick
Am I the only one who noticed that at 7:00 you see Ryan going to sleep to the right and Greg going to sleep to the left. Later you see when they wake up again in the morning it's reversed
What are you doing man?
Wait, how did they get that string?
biwding
I honestly thought everything melted on the third day and they have to start all over again
Did you have a permit to build this?
Lmao watching this on my birthday and had the biggest laugh 😅 Love 😍
This is actually really cool, I expected him to find some kinda loophole with a joke but this was actually very real and entertaining (not to say Ryan isn’t usually entertaining but this was a cool change)
9:21. Eskimos hate him! Learn how this man made a fire just in 2 seconds!
*Added minecraft bgm and sound effect
Welp you tried
It all changed when the fire nation attacked.
2:43 omg 😂😂😂
just 2 random dudes who missed out snow on their childhood and now catching up
You guys really look like them when you build I thought I was watching primitive technology
$2300/month - 2 bedroom, 1 toilet, 1 heated living room with gas stove. Just put in the slide for the kids and a new roof. Close to bus station, movie theatre and grocery store. Damage deposit required, no parties or drugs in house please.
i was happily surprised about how entertaining this was
This is epic ahahahahahahaha😀
Ryan! your face is very pale.
You guys found some natural twine
well Ryan & Greg are fine if he goes homeless
The sound of snow crunching is surprisingly relaxing...
That was epic lol
Hey Ryan, can you do another episode of Ryan Tries
Ryan is uploading way more frequently from what I’m used to lol

Edit: My god... he replied... dies
0:00 Opening stuff, teasers.

 ASMR outro
Wow Ryan was right, they are just speaking their mind and the views and likes went down, all the fake subs left, only the real ones left
Bring back paco bruh i love that guy his down to earth person
David just keeps defending apple like his life depends on it. Maybe he's secretly works for Apple who knows
I David Choi acknowledge that I spoke over others in this podcast and will vow to be better.

Thanks,
David
One person should say OFF the next person should say THE and the last person can say PILL. Then everyone can say PODCAST together...
Edit: For the intro
I'm seeing my boy David Choi is getting hate. I get it, some times he interrupts and seems like he isn't listening, but he's also entitled to his opinion, and it's his first Off the Pill Podcast. I'm sure he will get more used to it and I think he was plenty interesting this episode too. You guys are doing great, and I miss Paco.
Who else came back from podcasts #12 to see the hate comments
Dear Ryan,
Can you make a song using only TeeHees?
Im LIVING for how active Ryan is nowadays & that he's finally posting videos that make him content. I love these podcasts as they are thought provoking and touches on controversial topics. Go Ryan!! Don't let the subs or views deter you because us real fans will support you through & through!!
will was grabbing sleeves with david about the in-n-out analogy, lol
Seriously felt like Ryan was repeating himself 5-8 times per point just so David would absorb it between his pointlessly interrupting. Made the episode hard to listen to.
You should add more ads bruh. It's okay. After all it's an hour long.
2:27 Weird/Interesting Sayings
6:57 Would You Rather
16:18 YouTube
18:10 Apple Conspiracy
 Incest and PC Culture

In case any one needs this.
Don't ask why. I was just bored.
You can also find segments on HigaTV ;)
I got 2 ads in this video and honestly I don't mind. Don't be shy to put more ads y'all, get dat coin you deserve it
David. Just stop talking about apple. It's starting to hurt listening to.
Gaaad stop it.
I need a time stamp to skip all this apple talk. 
Ryan, you make a fair point on the slowing down. 
David, as he said, is definitely an apple fanboy.
I do not agree with anything David was saying about apple, David is not even listening to what he, himself is saying
Damn, David is deep in the apple hole. Don't be so impressionable people. Do your own research.
the 1.5k dollar iphone xs max costs about 450 dollars to make. 1.1k in profits. what
Ryan’s podcasts are not your usual podcasts
Dude David does not know what he’s talking about
Can Marley be on the next podcast? Make him do a speech.
Personally I really like the new things they’re doing. I wasn’t disappointed in the slightest when the official announcement was made. Strangers can’t kept relying on influencers and celebrities to do everything THEY want. Everyone should be more supportive and be thankful for the free and amazing content here over so many years and all the smiles, laughter, learning and creativity. Ryan is still the same person and he’s even said he’ll still be doing he main content everyone is used to as well. Also rmeber the fact that their videos and projects can take months to finish and is anyone surprised? Have a rewatch and get  back to me. I am genuinely wondering if Ryan is genius because of his thought process and ideas that stun the world. Here on HigaTV and NigaHiga you will NEVED find anything like this.

More people ought to understand that Ryan has his own life and aspirations  and ideas that aren’t don’t all surround what you expect. You can never guess what’s he’s going to come out with- even if you think you know it turns out you had him on a tiny scale despite you knowing that scale actually was already huge. He’s on a bigger scale, has a way of making what he does 10x better that your brain can process. Another reason why I think he may be a genius. And I’m not at all sayin Ryan is perfect but I’m not saying he’s not. And no I’m not a fan girl or anything. I can see and appreciate people who work hard and want to help others. But more importantly, is so great when someone can take even a tiptoe aside and focus on themselves and what they need in order to not only survive in such a difficult work but also be healthy and happy.

I think Ryans capabilities ate underestimated these days but it’s early compared. Give him more of a chance to blow your minds and your hearts and you might be thoroughly impressed. So much so that you’ll have wished you’d put more faith In him sooner.
I’m glad that he and his friends are making the move. I know Ryan thinks that people was giving up on him but he’s had so much positive feedback from the podcast, even when it first came out! Personally, I’ve seen over the years that Ryan’s content has been different in many ways. He’s created and shared so much and it’s been so long that of course it’s changed. He changes with life and emotions likeanyone should have a healthy one. It’s not that deep. Don’t know how such a majority didnt see it coming but I think really more people know he’s into bigger and better tings. Theres always someone who wants to see you fail in life but one thing is for sure Ryan is still succeeding. Off The Pill Podcast #4 !!  🙏👏👏

Dear Ryan, this is not a    this is to show you the level of respect that you deserve. You and your friends have my full support and there are supporters who understand. This is the internet and the internet is forever. So even when we’re gone, what you’ve built will never turn to dust-that’s just how this works! Love from London 🇬🇧 💖
I dont think David understands some people can NOT afford the upgrades of apple! I agree with Ryan on that for sure
Are you sure it's not David who's off the pill.
pe·do·phile
noun
a person who is sexually attracted to children.
   A child cannot consent. And that's not what being in love is. You can't grow old with a child because they will grow old then that pedophile will find another child to "be with".   Its a condition it should not be tolerated. Kids are easily manipulated and all. I hope you get my point.
you guys should live stream this.  Then take ideas from the comments in the live feed
David was pretty annoying in this tbh. Ryan keeps making good points to direct the conversation to an interesting path but David keeps interrupting and destroying the conversation. I liked Paco's inputs way better. He enriched the dialogue instead of constantly destroying it.
This podcast really grabs my sleeves.
Ryan is 100% bang on with his point.  David is too much into defending iPhone and they way they run things.  You're right Ryan that they are inadvertently forcing customers to switch out to a newer model.  Its 100% why I've switched out to android.  Its definitely more inconvenient at first, but once you get out of that monopoly, you'll be alright.  David doesn't seem to understand the consumer point of view.  You guys are absolutely right that the phone DOES slow down.  It happens every single year.  Android doesnt force you to update and slow down your phone if you dont.   Let's just close off that David is a die hard Apple fan. Lol
51:30 David just proved his bias by saying Apple is higher quality like in-and-out burgers and android is low quality like McDonald's.
I don’t understand why people get offended when someone else has an opinion, not everyone has to agree on a certain point and I think it’s amazing that Ryan is stating his opinions up front
I truly love this unfiltered content this is what I really love from rhpc💞
"Is that offensive? oh well.."

a great attitude! :D
Note to David Choi: think of better analogies!
 I find Ryan and Will trying to make sense of David's ridiculous analogies entertaining but damn bro
Start the podcast with a "Hey Guys!" It's simple and on-brand!
David we get it man, you WORSHIP/LOVEEE iphone. It's Ryan and Will's opinion about iphone. They can see what a scam Apple is pulling. Open your eyes(not racist) and see the truth.
Um pedophilia isn’t wrong because it’s against the law; it’s wrong because a child literally can’t consent to having sex when their brains aren’t fully developed. They don’t understand the consequences of their actions and the power dynamics are so messed up. It’s very different than being black or gay because they aren’t doing anything harmful by being themselves and they physically/scientifically aren’t less than other people. However, children are physically different than adults and their brains aren’t equal to that of an adult.
I'm really digging the podcasts. Its just satisfying because you have a history of enjoying the channel so you're listening to someone familiar to you instead of some random stranger.

And SO HAPPY ITS ON SPOTIFY!
To weigh in on the Apple conversation, I would (probably) never get any phone other than Apple. But I’ve never cared to buy the computers, and I don’t see myself getting one any time soon. I don’t see the point of paying so much more for a laptop that is just as good (for what I use it for) as Windows. I love Windows. They’re (imo) more user friendly.
But also, I think Ryan is being a little dramatic. I have an iPhone 6 which is super “old” now being about 4 years old according to tech these days. And it works super well. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Idk, it may be slightly slower than it used to, but not to the point that makes it anywhere near unusable. I find it to be perfectly fine. There have been issues (replaced battery and replaced screen that turned black) throughout the years, but most tech is that way.
6:30 weird muscle contraction but certainly 😂😂
Lol David Choi reminds me of my brother who is pretentious. I had a hard time listening to this as he kept interrupting the person who was trying to make a point. Just some constructive criticism — please let them speak David and hear them out and then speak! :,)
David, I have had my Samsung phone for over 3 years, and it works like the day I bought it.
Would love it if there was time stamps for each topic but loved the podcast
Dude david is mad my s8 is working perfectly fine like its amazing
i loved the apple talks! Great job, keep doing this podcasts.
I love these podcasts, I wondered why you quit making them the first time you went live with them, but finally!
"Holy crap I need Animoji" 😂
You should inhale in the beginning ... it makes sense
I liked David Choi a lot. He sounds super smart and is really relaxing to listen too. I love these podcasts ☺️
I acidently pause, and I was gonna I pause till 

WHOA, LONGER THAN 1 HOUR.
I am really no where near buying an iPhone, but yet I watched a 30-40 minutes segment on it, I don't even know why.
Holy crap he made so many more vids this month
I love the way how PISSED Will got at the In n out analogy
Petition for Ryan to shout-out PewDiePie
Okay David just keeps avoiding Ryan and Wills points.  Like he just keeps and keeps defending apple, I have an iPhone too but the slowing down thing is very true.  The iPhone slows down when then new one comes out, that’s a fact and everyone knows it’s true.  And Apple comes out with a new phones really often so you have to buy a new phone like really often and Apple isn’t cheap.  Honestly tempted to switch to android too.
Will saying "Get 'em!" sounds like a 19-year-old who says swag unironically lol.
Ryan: "I was a blackberry guy"
Choi: "oh my gosh"
Ryan: "oh blackberry used to be great"
Choi: *exhale tiredly
Ryan: "we can text without even looking"
Choi: "my goshhhh"
See how ignorant Choi is to our poor boi Ryan :(
I got so excited when Jenna and Julien mentioned this podcast in their podcast and suggested collabing podcasts😂
Idk why everyone was mad at David, he’s entitled to his own opinion.
I liked Paco a lot more than David
Off the Pill Debates: Episode 1
"This is why we have more male viewers"
Female Ryan Higa fans where you at! 🙋‍♀️
THE CALCULATOR BLOCK GAME YES RYAN... I feel old lmao
OnePlus has very consistent packaging and it also looks clean. Only thing missing would be stores but I'm sure they're not far away from opening those, seeing the growing popularity of the brand.
Disclaimer - nothing they say is true or false.  Please research for yourself to understand the topics discussed.  Be careful, this podcast is all for entertainment purposes and not fact.  Teehee.
9:33 what’s wrong with you Ryan it’s a shi shi break. 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
David’s held both an axe and a spear? What an axespearience
I LOVE THESE!! <3


Also, does anybody watch these hole things, cause i do!
i had the Samsung s5 for 3 years and it worked just fine 
had some bugs at the end.. yes, but wasn't slowing down with every release
I couldn’t finish this podcast because I felt like David wasn’t letting Ryan and Will speak. Everything they would say he would come in and rebut and It was just so irritating to listen to. I listen on the Apple (hehe) podcast app and I was curious to see if anybody picked up on it as welI - glad to know I’m not alone. I tried so hard to listen because I love me a good conspiracy theory but I just couldn’t. I think Ryan and will had good points but it’s a shame we didn’t get to hear them go in depth.
Does David work for Apple or something...? Like what is this?
Ryan and Will- Hey why did u buy that shirt?

David-So theres this restraunt right
So, modular phones are built like PCs, replace the monitor and components
I don't why got so angry after hearing this podcast






David.......😔
Life is like a sin and cosine graph. Ryan  made math reeally interesting. 
This whole podcast was insightful. The only podcasters I can actually sit and listen.
Dear Ryan, can you put this podcast on soundcloud?
4 videos in one week?! ok somethings wrong
Would you rather have 4 Great Danes and baby twins or 4 Great Danes and theyby twins in your king sized bed?
I've been using this Samsung S7 for 3 years.
Ryan you should watch The Walking Dead again. Ever since season 9 came along and Angela Kang became the show runner, the show has been awesome! (AMC should sponsor me.)
David Choi: Im not a fanboy

>Defends everything about iphone without listening to others.
Really digging these. Keep it up!
david choi talks more than ryan does and its annoying. this is the nigahiga channel and not the davidchoiknow-it-all channel. will is awesome tho btw
Don’t know if I agree with the whole ~aPplE coNsPiraCy~ thing. I’ve had my 6s for almost 4 years now and it works great
i respect David and his opinions, but when someone starts reusing the same arguments to defend their opinion, basically just rephrasing them while essentially constantly saying the same thing, it clearly shows lack of deeper insight into the topic.
also, as much as i still liked this podcast, i find the ones with Paco far more interesting and enjoyable because he keeps the topics from becoming stale and doesn't let them run certain thoughts and ideas into the ground but rather helps them spontaneously evolve and transition to other topics, concepts and ideas.
it may be because i'm not used to listening to David but i found his way of conversing a bit tiring because he would always express his thoughts on a topic and then that's it. i like that Paco actually asks follow up questions, he responds to Ryan and Will by commenting on their views, challenges their statements as well as adds with his own quirky but interesting and amusing thoughts, theories, stories and philosophies.
in any case, i still gave the episode a like because i did like the topics and hearing what everyone's stances on them were, i just wish they could've progressed more. still a good podcast though. :)
This is my favorite thing on youtube right now. AMAZINGGGGG!!!!
Is David secretly an apple advertiser? Hmmm 🤔
jeez, yall bashing on David too much
I work 10hrs on 2nd shift till 1am and I am loving  your podcast to keep me entertained while I assemble parts. Thanks guys❤
i really like these podcasts! you guys talk about interesting topics and listening to you guys talk helps me focus on my homework, keep it up so i can keep up my grades! lol  <3
I love to watch your videos. You make anything it's super interesting and awesome!! Watching your videos daily, really lifts up my mood!! Ryan Higa- the best YouTuber ever!!!
I missed Paco this podcast.
I’m LIVINGGGGG for these podcasts 🙌🏼 great content. Thank you!!
can u make off the pill but its awkward
Amazing keep doing these please
Ok but what about incest in terms of adopted children?

Fosters, Brallie, anyone know where I’m at?
Ryan has ADHD and yet was still able to hold to his own points and arguments especially when David couldnt see his points about PC culture and social acceptance
I felt like David was not on the same page for a lot of the podcast lol
Dear Ryan, can you go rival against youtube?
Maybe  also post videos on your website not through youtube links or build a streaming platform?
The entire time I was looking at the bobble head in the background of Ryan
Ryan you are my spirit animal dude. adhd club indahouse. that legit logical thought process is fire. respect
I want to hear this R-rated would you rather they’re talking about 6:57
Actually spends an hour on not doing Homework "Success"
Lol the best part of this podcast was finding out David doesn't know you can get ecoli from eating fecies😂😂😂
Ryan:Uploads almost daily

Everyone: 0_0
im really liking these podcast , keep it up PLEASE !!!
Normal YouTuber : 4 ads in 20 minutes 
Ryan: 1 ad In 1 hour 
This is why I love Ryan
Next topic ideas: anxiety, conspiracies, NASA, Obama and Trump, Asian pros and cons,freedom, bullying
comes in for ASMR and other stuff 
70% of video is Apple
I thought people were exaggerating but dame David was interrupting!!
I did not hear them talk about anything even related 2 ASMR
Are we sure this is Ryan he’s uploading way too much
David's ignorance to Samsung and Android in general made me stop listening halfway through. Apple intentionally slows down old phones through software updates and that's that. There's no "more features" bs that David is talking about. Typical Apple user who can't see both sides of the story.
2020 Presidential Election:Ryan Higa for president
Relationships without consent (incl power dynamics) = bad. 
Relationships with consent = let them do what they want.

Nice and simple.
This podcast wus full o beens
I feel like Will became a big mediator for this episode XP
Do a conspiracy video about AirPods
I love listening to these podcasts Ryan! Love coming home from work on a Friday night and starting my weekend early by listening to the podcast while doing my nails~ Best company ever! :D
Lol dear Ryan: make a podcast. 
Off-the Pill Podcasts episode 2 👍🏻
Loving the Podcast guys keep it up. Man.. I was on a podcast once, had a blast, wish it would get uploaded, lol.

Oh and I don't think y'all talked about ASMR enough, lol. 

Sorry Ryan... No tingles this time.
great one of the weirdest podcast on the world





amazing
Love what you’re doing guys! Be you and be true! The Podcasts are super enjoyable, funny, serious and makes a lot of great points! Love you all so much, keep up the good work!

P.S. I STILL MISS SEEEEEAAAAAANNNN 😫😫😫

I hit it and it goes 17k 
cool
"This is exactly why we have more male viewers" 😂😂😂
Your intro is deciding what the intro is 😂😂
Have u ever lost your airpod after maybe a week use?
Me neither :vvv
This felt like David defends Apple.
And I miss Paco. He balances out the podcast.
Aw these are just too long! Would love to watch full video but 30 min is my time limit😂
Android user here. I would say android is probably equally shit in this aspect. Also have to do with the phone running more apps as the software updates.
I must be hallucinating. Two videos from Ryan in 2 days
This is why my parents make me take my "chill pill"
Ryan, watch—zombie drama Kingdom (korean netflix).
I didn’t the notification for any of these videos 😭
Logan Paul:impaulsive the best podcast in the world.
Ryan: I have over 20 times the subs as impaulsive so - HOLD MY BEER
"Is incest wrong?"

Not if you're a hentai protagonist
I installed Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Chess, Minesweeper on my TI-84 CE
Damn Ryan be pulling YouTubes sleeves
get this on Spotify
in my personal experience every iphone until the 6S was unusable from some point of view. including the 6, which bent in people‘s pockets. the 5 had a absolutely godawful battery and the ones before were even worse for so many more reasons. at the same time each and every single generation DID bring huge improvements over the last one.

but interestingly enough, after the 6S was released, nothing important and new has been added, quite on the contrary. they removed the plug for headphones immediately on the 7, like what the fuck? like hell will i spend that kind of money on headphones, i lose/wreck mind easily 5 times a year.

and to come to a close, with steve jobs there were vast improvements all the time, he is indeed the visionary. at the same time he didnt care about the details. all the phones he released had so many very important problems eg the bend gate. tim cook on the other hand doesnt or just barely improves anything at all, any new addition is a joke, he reached meme states ages ago whenever he announces the newest cashgrab. at the same time i do have to admit that the iphones do work better and more consistently.

i am still using my iphone 6s plus and i would only ever upgrade if they actually vastly improved the newest generation. but they dont and i am fine witht not spending money on a new phone. the battery IS getting weaker slowly but surely but i am taking good care of it. unfortunately i broke the screen, so i‘ll have to get that replaced, but no way imma shell out nearly 200 bucks for that, i‘ll let a different company do that for me for a fraction of the money
Listening to David Choi talk about apple is grating. I like the podcast as a whole but damn that was so hard to listen to.
David: says anything 
Ryan: immediately disagrees
Will: -_-
It'll be awesome if u guys had other guest stars from other channels and tell ghost stories lmao.
I’m loving these podcasts. Keep it up. Looking forward to the next ones.
Ryan’s comment sections are the best people actually have genuine conversations and respect for each other keep it up guys 🤗

Also great vid as always ❤️
Ryan I love this pod cast!!!!!!! Please keep making them
I feel like David was missing Ryan's point for most of the cast, especially the latter half of the cast :/ I do see where both sides are coming from, but the fact that Ryan had to repeat the same question after about 7-8 minutes of getting essentially nowhere is :(
i’ve been listening to ur podcasts everytime i paint lol
I like them both, but David Choi is Apple washed.
Why is everyone hating on David?
Did anyone else get more progressively irritated and annoyed as you kept on listening to David Choi talk about how great apple is?
Love you Ryan and Will🥰❤️but please do not invite David back...
"It just doesn't work" 
come on, we all know that that isn't an accurate description of a problem
I really love your podcasts! Please keep them going 😊💖
RYAN, DO A COOKING CONTEST BETWEEN :
RYAN & SEAN (or ARDEN)
VS
WILD CARD (DERRICK & PACO)
VS
WILL & GREG
Jesus David Choi would follow Apple off a cliff.
Team Android 🤙🏽
These podcasts are really enjoyable. I think that its great that you have an area where you can speak your mind, freely. Continue making these and posting them.
I don’t do my updates and nothing happens... maybe it’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Here is your guest line up:
KevJumba
Chester See
Sean 
Kina Grannis 
Andrew Garcia 
Cathy Nguyen
AJ Rafael 
D-Trix

You’re welcome! 🤗
I didn't even realising they were interrupting each other lol. Only when I read these comments. To me it looked like a normal discussion. 💁‍♀️
Love David! My best friend and I are the same when discussing something we have a different point of view on😂 
As some one who grew up with siblings the talking over each other thing is normal😂 I forget that others don’t.
shi-shi
 shi, from the Japanese shiko ‘urine.’ Also imitative of the sound of streaming water. “to urinate; to go wee-wee.” Used in hawaii. pidgin slang,
I love these! Makes passing the time drawing so much easier ^_^
David:
SPONSORED BY APPLE

"Steve Jobs was a visionary"
this podcast is just the foam of the beer
I love how deep this podcast got, and how you guys talked about such “sensitive” topics without a care. This is definitely the Ryan Higa that is finally doing the videos he wants, and the Ryan Higa I love. Keep it up!!!
Dear Ryan, where's the YouTube ReRyan 2018?
Ryan and Will
make a good point against Apple
David: BUUUUUUTTTTTTTT ,for MEEEEEEE........
Dude! I got the CHILLS from that great out-tro
keep up the good work guys, i've been enjoying these podcasts!!
in and out is not apple. 
_Will 2019
I usually hate podcasts but I honestly am so interested in yours, and actually pay attention—
Ryan- “in hawaiii we say shee-shee”
Me: I know, you told us the last time!
its so stressful to listen to david talking over ryan and NOT LISTENING and not understanding ryan's points when ryan makes more sense... see how ryan keeps saying "yeah that's what i'm saying, that's what i'm saying"
Call adern cho maybe
RYAN, i always had that same weird thought too. You're not alone!!
At 10:57 Will and David are like perfectly harmonised for a second 😂
These podcast are my thing noww!!!
Welcome to the Off the Pill Podcast, where I'm off my meds and we see what comes out our heads.
Can U please add podcast to Spotify :D  so I can listen at work hahahaha
34:30 That's actually a really good idea.
I'm curious on your thoughts about "antinatalism". 🤔 Came across this the other day... And oh boy...(or girl... Or genderless? 🤔🤔🤔)
I can see why people disliked this episode so much, but hey David’s human. He was passionate about what he was talking about.
David is so gullible with all the Apple stuff. He’s blinded by the branding and status of Apple.
I love Nokia’s game , BOUNCE !! I can’t play anymore since got deleted from the phone D:

I bet no one feels what I feel about this game . It’s hard to pass during the later stage
YouTube go back to your roots🤦🏻‍♀️
J-just switch to Samsung brah.
Which podcast is better?
Like- off the pill
Comment- impaulsive
i like this. ryan + his buddies look so laid-back and natural. it's a nice change of pace :)
U need more ads on Ur podcasts. U deserve it! We won’t mind






If anyone is wondering what my edit was, it was the word “ur” it auto corrected to Naruto. Lol
damn ryan is so passionate about apple products
yo. i never realized how swaggy you were ryan. you’re talking about some REAL shit my dude. i love these.
Bring Paco back next week please, but this still a great podcast!
Agent’s of a Secret Stuff all hail Ryan Higga for 9 years he has served ASS as a true loyalist.
40,5 minutes of Apple-talk🍎
Please Paco instead of David!
I'm reading the comments and love the fact that what ryan and sean said was true xD paco ends up being the most loved in the RHPC crew xD. I love paco :)
43:00 sorry but my Samsung hasn't slowed for the 2+ years I've had it and they came out with quite a few phones and updates
I've been a SAMSUNG/Android user my whole life sooooo my opinion in this is extremely biased & i had a BlackBerry in 4th grade
Did David delete his comment??
I love how Will is guiding their conversation 💕
Still using my 4s, but just downgraded to iOS 8.2 for speed
it’s interesting to see Ryan’s relationship between different members of RHPC. They’re all his friends, obviously, but there’s different ‘types’ of friends, you know? Anyway it’s really cool to see. Off the pill is awesome because i feel like im getting closer to one of my favorite content creators and getting to see the real them. I feel like a realer fan lol 😆
Hey Ryan plz read this but are 
You emotional or logical?
In india, there's many arranged marriages b/w relaitves for example my dad's mother and my mothers dad are both blood related siblings.(Im just happy nothing went wrong with me lol).
pc culture is slowly disappearing
all that apple stuff made me want to boycott apple forever... but I ain't gonna do that :3
We need this on Spotify
Love podcasts. I'm 25 and have grown with this channel since 15. Keep up the great content! Although the camera switching so fast is disorienting.
Imagine: it's 2030, apple has just introduced Iphone xv, but they are a collaboration with lego, so its build your own iphone😂
I’m like marathoning these podcasts now...three days so far! lol (I’m going kinda out of order but I’m getting my fix!)
1:04:40 how i felt when David tried arguing his points
Apple will continue to make money off off their $900 chargers.... and other accessories.
I got u Ryan. I’ve grown up on sayin sheeshee (lets go Hawaii)
14.59 "This is exactly why we have more male viewers" Yeah XD
I'm not tryna be that guy, but, they were kinda uneducated about the phone topic and I found it kinda hard to listen to. A big thing is that phones slowing down is some ways not apples fault, software (like apps people use) gets more demanding which can make your phone feel slower overall, as a phone gets older, just like computers it starts to slow down due to the fact that ram slows over time (kinda), and also apple slowed down peoples phones so the batteries would die slower as the batteries slowly died. Another problem as through use and physical damage, although a phone may not be completely damaged, they can still slow down due to something coming loose or becoming damaged. To be fair, i'm not an expert and I wouldn'y expect them to be either, but it is just a side to show that large companies like apple are just trying to screw people over.
SO HAPPY we r getting more vids

edit: I didn't really agree with everything you guys said here but I respect you for finally saying what's on your mind this pc stuff is annoying
Hey Ryan, I know that these podcasts gain relatively less views than your other videos but there are those of us who really appreciate these. Please keep on making them. :D
Is that a Ninja Melk can under the I Dare You trophy at 11:36?
TBH you guy are really interesting to listen too keep it up 👍
YAAAS RYAN YOU DO YOU BOO BOO LOVIN THIS CONTENT
I feel like David was off the pill,because he was talking about random stuff😁😂
With apple and their phones, I believe the term you're looking for is called "planned obsolescence" 🙃
dear ryan

Can you make a movie using parts of your youtube videos mashed together
Damn,let's see in 20 to 30 years
I love this ryan, I do my work while listening to you and its always interesting
Had the very same conversations with my group of friends. Ryan you have no idea how much you think like me! xD
Where's Paco? I feel like he should be the main spokesperson for this podcast...
these podcasts are very informational and the best for my commute to uni!
Officially done with David
You should get Huawei or 1+
I love how these podcasts just kinda let us (the viewers) just pretty much hang out with them and be part of their crew! <3 And we get more of Ryan! ;D
listening to this while doing homework is perfect
I agree with David in that when I dont choose to update my iOS software when the notification thing pops up, my phone works the same. Same speed, it's all fine. And I also agree that Apple does this because they just have to expand as a company, isn't this how business works, where they have to move forward and so software updates are inevitable, no? How else can Apple maintain their business now that we know the hype is gone there's no exciting new models exciting new features or other products, not anything that can top the hype when iPhones first came out.

But I definitely think that even if Apple gives a higher quality service/product, it's not okay when the price is too high (but then what is "too high" haha) I also agree that there should always be competition within an industry, otherwise the prices will go up too high because of the monopoly thingy dunno the exact term.
Please make more vids! We all love your vids, you are funny and creative! (Especially Dear Ryan)
This is one of the few podcasts I’ve listened to where it frustrated me that I couldn’t join the conversation. Idk if that’s good or bad? 👀
I'm early, can I get a heart?
Edit: Holy crap!!! I checked youtube during the Super Bowl Halftime and saw that my comment had gotten hearted by RYAN!!! GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!
Why don't you start these podcasts with 


HiGaeez
David Choi supports apple so much and defends the greed of apple by calling it "business" and "moving forward" and "sucks for the consumers who can't keep affording to buy new ones" and "who doesn't care about customers and employers alike because they're replaceable" like he's the reason why such company keeps becoming more greedy...it's not innovation but knowing there's people like him. As someone who currently owns an iPhone and an android I can say android is definitely more efficient and more practical while iPhone is more "artsy" and all about appearance. And it's sad that we live in that type of society. 

Thank you Ryan for bringing out actual information about both products and thinking how the products do affect consumers and employers and not just about "innovation and moving forward"
I liked the vids I understand you Ryan keep doing what you want to do. Keep it up
43:30  no it is not.
I'm a OnePlus fan I buy all their phones but my old phones are still as fast as they were at the start. 
Don't just generalize stuff.
Yes! I love these podcasts.
I can't stop watching the bobble head in the corner of ryan's cam ;-;
I love these podcasts, they’re really the perfect amount of foam on the beer (And Ryan’s way more active now and I’m lovin it)
I like hearing Ryan talk about Hawaii because I can never see his shows so that's the closest I could be
Bring back paco. David needs to stop talking so much LOL
Daaamn, David Choi is so much in denial about what Ryan and Will says about Apple products. I literaly stopped watching around the 45-minute mark because I was so irritated at how much of a Apple fanboy David is. Ugh. Haha.
the apple conversation was so heated that I paused in between watched a Parkourse video and came back to continue with the rest
no more david please. bring back Paco or someone else.. This dude dumb
Lol i love how many times you ask the same question and nobody is answering you directly XD
I wonder if these guys know their podcasts are going on other podcast apps like acast
lol don't ask why but I heard dog meat since he said the meat is dog food xD
How did it become poop?!
I like how Apple fanboys justify shady business practices.
6:30 that’s actually a saying in Germany, we say „Schaumkrone“
Listening to David here was so damn painful. He's literally hypothesising and presenting his non-expert opinions as facts. Repeatedly. And kept talking over Will & Ryan.
I was so frustrated hearing David defend Apple when Ryan was stating facts. lmao love this podcast
Apple products are clean and nice looking, and are of pretty high quality but still too overpriced
ahh i loved playing brick breaker on my dad’s blackberry when i was younger, love that this podcast brought back that good memory
But what about the Sean Fujiyoshi collab?
Dude can you bring back BGA?
Just switch to Oneplus! D: I love their phones!
About the Apple/Android/Phone stuff. 

I think it also really hard to move away from a brand unless you try another brand out. 

I really liked Apple but I accidentally dropped my phone (ruined the screen) during a difficult time(I can't replace it nor fix the screen) and my mom handed me her extra phone from Samsung. At first, I was little hesitant about using the phone but eventually I saw its perks. 

Getting more memory, not having to constantly delete my stuff for apps or photos, having a usb connector, free apps, friendly interface and other stuff. I told my mom that I wanted to switch to Samsung.

**Sidenote:

More and more brands are competing in the market rn.
I want to be friends with Will..
And switch to android
when r u guys gonna do the next parkourse? 






3 Years Later.....
I'm still waiting.....
Dear ryan, can you promote something without making a promotion, or have a promotion without promote something?.. 🤔🤔
by far my favorite episode of the podcast.
Dear Ryan,

Can you do a video on the answer of “42” from Douglas Adams’ Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to The Galaxy?
Hey Ryan can you make a fart music without whoopie cushion, cuz that would be really cool and awesome!!
😁
Will you be mad if I say I miss Pako can we have him stay as regular too?
10:39 

;-; Ryan is still addicted to Red Bull ;-;
I mean incest was a thing back then  in the royal family because they wanted to keep a “pure" blood line.
I feel like android is the same way I have a lot of those same problems but I get it when I'm 2 phones back or about half way through 1 new  phone
58:45 THE GAME IS LITERALLY CALLED BLOCK DUDE.
I like Paco better tbh. I love David don't get me wrong, I'm a Digital Commander but the way he was putting out his points idk. He has acknowledged it so I'm sure he will be better next time.
clean so i can watch it with my parents, btw they liked the first one
You can tell how tired Ryan is of trying to explain his ideas and just getting cut off 1:04:42
Why is nigahiga losing subs? We need to get him on the top my bros.
I'm back 10 days later to try to finish this, even though I tried spreading it out in 3 days previously, and have watched every video released since
I live for these podcasts.
16:00 why is Ryan drinking Red Bull he has enough energy 😂
Apple wants to know your location
Veryyyyyyyyyy good podcast but god damn man i gotta agree with others David gotta go he is just talking and not thinking
Yo Ryan post the one about Derrick in the podcast 😂
wait why dont yall use an audio interface with multiple mic inputs so yall can record three voices at once, instead of recording it three separate times. And you can put your microphones in different tracks on your daw lol
The best intro is when you talk about not having an intro
Did I really just watch an hour podcast???? I would never be able to do this
Yellow Paco u should be in here!!
Oh god that discussion about phones was uninformed. So much speculation when the info is official. Apple is releasing updates to specifically slow down your processor. Not related to features. Just simply slow it down. Their reasoning is that over time your battery gets worse, so to have your battery still last, they slow down your phone.
I can go the rest of my life without listening to David choi talk again
Man, David, you were both right and wrong about the whole iOS software thing.
Apple's newer softwares are designed to be friendly only to newer models and unfriendly to older hardware.
This is not because they cant make it so it's friendly too all their products.
It's because they've designed it to be unfriendly to older products.
It's intentional. Because ultimately speaking, by and large Apple's hardware development follows the same architecture. They dont not abandon structures in a fashion which requires new and complete recreation of the software.
i'm loving this, the freedom of speech is legit!!! keep doing you ryan!!!
2019 is going to be good cause we got the off the pill podcast!!
I never watch podcast...





But the one time i do its about asmr and incest
Putting it simplistically, I find Apple a monopoly within itself, so I stick with android because it's more flexible for me.
By the middle of the video what's going through my mind, 'Foooooood 🤤'
I'm a samsung user and I don't harbor the same hatred for apple that I used to but I just always loved the innovation samsung brought forward. Every new phone is actually new imo. They don't repackage the same thing with new designs. I just appreciate the constant effort for true improvement. The ecosystem iPhones has built is wild though but unless you're a teenage girl (not being sarcastic) I don't think you'll ever have an issue once you switch. Nobody stops talking to you bc your bubbles are green and nobody cares lol. It's just better tech for a better price and you'll never have a problem with people stealing your charger lmao
had to skip the apple part... ughrusksjej
Thank you for posting this now, I almost thought I was gonna have to work.
This will definitely bring you haters but I love this, or just human being honest in general WITHOUT intentionally trying to hurt each other. This podcast gives off the same vibe as your other videos. Keep it up.

And the world you're talking about will come thanks to people who think "we should make our own rules" and are the reasons rules are there in the first place. You'll realise it when it happens (that incest is okay' kinda world). As a fan I hope Ryan's reading this.
Hullo, please raise the volume of the audio ty
So far I liked the podcast cant wait to see your other episodes 💓
Dear Ryan,



Bring back Skitzo
David is this kinda guy where he wants to convince you to turn to his point of view so bad but he’s so unwilling to have an open mind to your point of view
I haven't used Apple products in years but when I had the iPod Touch, the same thing would happen to me - the typing lag. I think it's just a thing old products do. Then again, I've had androids for years and they never did that.
Welp time to be 2 hours late for school
Dear Ryan,
Go to a random high school for a day. Just don't say anything, and walk into some teachers class
David is funny af
I don’t think David understands economics and monopolies or just anything relating to the Apple topic.
There is so much more to the Apple Eco-System than iMessages being Blue or text being green...
more podcasts !!
2:06 Karuna Satori asmr is shook
David choi is an apple fan boy. He just compared mcdonalds to android which is not. TBH apple should be the mcdonalds because they are popular around the world and is selling crap.
I could listen to your podcasts all day
I don't anything wrong with David, STOP hating on him people
...I'ts been 5 months since Sean left
Anyone looking at their hats
and  going..


ARMYY
“I’m full of water”

- David Choi , 2019
I honestly love these pod casts
Finally something that feels real.
Can you please make a video called "how to be like you favourite youtuber"
The thing moving in the background of Ryan ............ Dammit
The best thing about this podcast is that you guys are not afraid of speaking your mind and that's the kind of content that I'm subscribed to your channel for. Lovin the podcast and I hope it continues for long.
Keep doing this plz
Well back in the Middle East (where my family is from) my cousins got married 😬. And for them it’s no problem but for me when I found out was ew 😂
I feel guilty I listened to this on Spotify and didn't give it the watch time
this is one of the most frustrating podcasts ive ever seen.
If anyone here has taken marketing you know apple is literally using a tactic called Planned Obsolescence where they intentionally make products obsolete. Don't deny it David lol
btw.. BEST PODCAST EVER!!!
Can you also upload edited version of these podcasts ?? My internet ain't fast enough to watch hour long videos ??
This guy actually thinks apple is bring in top of the line tech... two cameras, remove the audio jack, make it bigger... Innovative indeed
The sandwich poop think was yuck. Other than that, love the video.
i've had my same Samsung for 3 years, it still works perfectly, looks sleek and keeps up with updates. Apple is throwing your money away because they know you are addicted
The title says “Is Incest Wrong?”... ummm..Ryan. I think you should take your pill.
can u do english subtitel under the Video? the automatic one is not so nice sometimes. would be awesome caus i need to read and hear to understand talkin like that :)
Welcome to episode 2 where ryan says " i know but im saying" a million times
I mean... bring Paco back haha. That's all I'm gonna say :)
I just wanna say that I really like these podcasts
Lol I've always preferred Android over Apple and I also find In N Out overrated as hell. I like In N Out a lot but super overrated
Keep it up Ryan!
I agree with everything Ryan said!!!
What does off the pill mean?
Nigahiga- off medication
Me- off birth pill......sorry
I disagree with David and agree with Ryan regarding Apple. Apple doesn’t care about the older phones and those consumers, they care about the newer ones and making profit, that’s it. David is definitely a apple fan because he can’t put his bias aside and look at it objectively. I switched from an IPhone 7 to a pixel 3 (my first android) and I have no regrets. All my friends and family have to deal with my green text messages now. iPhones are for people who don’t care about innovation and want simplicity, androids are for free creativity and innovation, without restrictions. I work in cellular atm and that’s what I tell people. They’re both good phones and the competition is good you just have to know what type of person you are and what you like.
No...not everyone has an iPhone.  Never have, never will.  And, we have In-and-outs, but, I've never been to one of those either.
Apple has already admitted to slowing down their aged products, they claim it is to protect the phone from completely shutting off due to the older battery being unable to supply the current needed to run the phone at their best speed.
That whole incest bit is just Ryan saying "I know" lmao
have you guys tried the OnePlus 6T?
Love the video, but dang, they talked about Apple a long time
Hi Ryan, I appreciate your “claps” to note the beginning of the podcast. As someone who enjoy listening to them on Spotify, it sounded very weird at the start.. anywho.. PLEASE DO MORE PODCASTS!! I LOVE THEM <33
beginning of vid we have to play a tamed would you rather 
end of video bestiality, pedophilia, insist
the sound in my 7 stopped working. got a replacement and everything was fine. then the sound went out again. i had to get a whole new phone and now i have an X
I'm glad he's continuing to find his niche at YouTube even after so many years, still trying new things. Love the podcasts.
Incest and beastiality ? This podcast may not very brand friendly Ryan XD
Apple could legitimately be skynet for real 😂😶
yall are BRAVE for this podcast lmao and i like it
Liked it better with Paco instead of David
Apple could legitimately be skynet for real 😂😶
I think the point where it stops is consent. A minor can’t actually consent to sex for example. An animal can’t either. That’s why it’s not okay. 
If two adult men who are both capable of making decisions decide they want to have sex or fall in love or whatever: it’s okay. They are capable of consent AND they aren’t harming anyone else with it. It doesn’t influence other people, not really.
Someone count how many times Ryan said "At what point..."
Dear Ryan, play pubg or fortnite(which ever suits you the best
Incest looks good ONLY in Anime
That one got hella controversial! I hope everyone understands that they aren't comparing homosexuality to incest and pedophilia and that their point was something different lol

One critique: I hope you won't start clickbaiting, because ASMR wasn't actually talked about here, Will just jokingly mentioned it once. Also, something I've noticed with one of the older podcasts: David and Ryan interrupt each other a lot and that's a little exhausting to listen to. I hope Paco will appear more often in the other podcasts because I feel like he prevented things like this from happening, he kept things calm and was an awesome moderator. Loved it otherwise, especially how the conversation just happens naturally, keep doing it!
You can like I product and still find flaws with it. When you blindly keep defending Apple you're just being biased and so all arguments are not credible.
Keep it up no pc👍🏽
i've only noticed it now that David has an Intent Bracelet like Ryan and Sean's necklace
Ryan and Will speak straight facts on Apple. I never buy the latest cus im a broke bish but they're literally encouraging you to buy the latest by ruining the older versions in terms of battery power and slowness.
The weirdest prodcast ever😰😰
I just love how Will says "get 'em" as a hype man even to himself. Just me? ok.
I am so here for your podcasts
You guys should watch the weekly planet ;)
More of Off The Pill please!!!! Its great
Last podcast 1 hour 17 minutes 40 seconds: 0 ads
This podcast 1 hour 18 minutes 54 seconds: 2 ads



We're improving yay
as to the animal debate, there's the practice of post humanism where the boundaries of humans and non-humans are discussed, and the book Bête deals with this topic and it's a very weird? book but I can really recommend it
There’s so many negative comments, but I love these podcasts to death!!! Please continue!!
The face of Ryan lol - Yeahhhhh David you won't be on the next podcast brahh - Good trial
Ah man, this podcast was the perfect amount of foam on a beer





So, does the phrase check out?
Love these podcasts Ryan.
So happy the podcast is back !!! great show guys!
I'm calling myself a Filibeano now
The dear Ryan evil twin is your video that you referred to
Will saying get'em is my spirit animal 😂😂
And ya'll, whether you acknowledge it or not, have answered exactly why many of us more conservative leaning folks had an issue with the lgbt push in our culture. Once you open the door to one, it continues to go down and down.
Loving it! Cant wait to see where this goes!
More podcasts!!!!!
What is the full form of asmr? can u talk more abt it 💁
i really don’t like david in this video i don’t know why
52:55 it aint much but its honest work
In rediscovering his channel again! Its amazing to see how someone could have such good content for so long.
Im not a podcast person but Ryan has me so interested in it now. Thanks Teehee Team
David choi is kinda bias bruh -_-
Ok only in America is apple the "it" company Android is the leading smartphone country in the world
My 7plus is the first phone I have had with Apple since the 4 that hasn’t bugged out right after releasing the newer model. I experienced all of these things until my 7. But my mothers 7 is very glitchy. 🤔
I remember playing pacman on my moms BlackBerry
Can u make more on Google Podcasts
One of my pet peeves is when people refer to iOS as iPhone EVEN THOUGH ITS IOS
and Android is FAR superior in terms of freedom and flexibility and ofc price.
Ryan seemed like he took his meds today. He seemed pretty focused during the apple conversation.
Guys let this man voice his opinions 😂😂. You don’t have to agree with him, but let him speak. You don’t have to watch the podcast if you don’t want to or you could just skip the Apple discussion 🤷🏾‍♂️.
I love these podcasts so much! I've been watching Ryan since the very beginning; I was in middle school at the time! And I used to love watching his playful videos, and now I work in an office Monday-Friday and I listen to his podcasts while I do my work.  It makes me feel like I really grew up with him
I see the BgA cap, subtle teaser?
I'm second hand embarrassed listening to that guy defending Apple like they're not just pumping out phones with minor adjustments to make truckloads of money while the population generates far more electronic garbage than they have to.
i couldn't finish this episode. david might be a cool guy, but he talked to much about nonsensical things and kept interrupting.
I have an android and I've never ever had any buggy problems or my phone slow down, and my battery last from 6am till 12pm at night. And I have tons of apps and consistantly running. I had a Samsung galaxy 6+ edge, never had a problem. Recently got and 8 because I could and wanted it and still zero problems 🤷🏽‍♀️ I'll stick with my Android over sleek look anyday :)
David.. Is making Apple look worse...i have never had such an obvious problem with Android?
Do you really have more Male viewers?? I had no idea 😂
My family was celebrating Chinese New Year and we were lighting the inscents, but my brother was lagging behind so I said:
"Noah! Hurry up or we won't be able to see the incest!" My whole extended family heard it. It was a very sad day for my mother.
yeah, when does it stop? soon you'll find people dating trees :/
U lost me half way through the video...😴
The Japanese side of my family said "shishi", so I heard that as a kid as well.
Love these but not the guest this time...
I feel like David waits his turn to talk rather than actually listening to other people’s statements.He also kept interrupting Ryan which was lowkey irritating.Idk just my observation.
I feel like David doesn’t know what he’s talking about most of the time
Btw i love the podcast its fun lmao.
Dear Ryan 
Can you make a boy band song about cars
in terms of "iOS vs Android", i much prefer practicality in almost every aspect of my life, so i don't have that "creative mindset appreciation" towards Apple products.... that's why Android all the way for me =P
Gotta echo what people said about Paco. He was better at moving the podcast along and prompts interesting topics. The Apple topic went on for too long.
Bring superwoman next
I love how unstructured this podcast is.
Never thought that this podcast will go this deep into different topics. Good brain exercise.
Will nye the science guyw
L
i can't with the whole Apple thing. The only thing Apple has at this point is marketing and it's name to sell you on. Android are better and if its really the aesthetic that you want, there are some beautiful slick androids (some that even look kinda like iphones) that will fulfill your need for a pretty phone. Everyone has an iphone because they were once the better phone and if you had one you were somehow "better". Everytime I have thought about getting an iphone i realise what i am doing is paying more money for something that will be outdated and not work in a year instead for an actually great phone with great features that can last me and is way cheaper
I don’t normally like Podcasts but this one is really entertaining and I didn’t get bored at all, keep up the good work guys!
Dear Ryan, Please make a GAME of THRONES conspiracy or parody
i know everyone already knows this, but all you have to do to stop your phone from slowing down is just not to update your phones software. it is very possible and it will keep your phone running smoothly.
Lol David was way too carried away defending Apple nonstop. As for me, I like both Android and Apple a lot. I'm always switching back an forth from both Android and Apple over an over again. I find that the advantage of an iPhone like the iPhone 8 Plus and up has top sound and picture quality and I never had any problems with their apps, like no crashing at all and most of the apps that I'd normally use on my Android, the iPhone has as well. The disadvantage of iPhones is their price and that you can't customize a lot of things like your home page an all, but on the Android you can easily  customize  everything, and with the iPhone it's more tricky to pick whichever music you want as your ringtone cause they mostly try an get you to buy their ringtones, but on the Android it's very easy to pick whatever  you want as your ringtone and also real easy to trim and amplify the audio you want to how you like it. So yeah I think they both have their advantage and disadvantage.  

I think a iPhone is perfect for you if you don't really care about customizing anything and like to keep it simple, but I like customizing my things so most of the time I'd stick with the Android. Honestly lately the Samsung Galaxy phones are becoming very overpriced, just like the iPhones.  My Galaxy S9 that I'm using right now is so not cheap. Kinda wish I went with the Apple iPhone XR instead since it's the same monthly payment price but better.  In the end I think Androids are normally the best, but if their price keeps on going way too high up and the iPhones start to be more affordable, then I'll have to switch back to the iPhone. Like if I wanted the Samsung Galaxy Note 9,  that phone's $999.99 right now and the new iPhone XR is just $750
OFF THR PILL 💊 PODCASTS ARE MY TYPE OF ASMR
These days
Everyone has podcasts
You should talk about YTF and the tour on the next one! Bring in D-Trix, Chester, anyone!
Ryan you might want to higher up the volume a little bit.
I'm really confused about that you don't know the Fairphone.
Does anyone else just argue their opinion out loud, even though you know your arguing to a screen
Planned obsolescence. Google it.
You guys should get the one plus 6t
I generally like David and I have no problem with him...but his opinions (which he is completely entitled to!) and his reluctance to LISTEN to others prevented me from listening to this in one sitting...
The podcasts are great!  :)
Wong Fu and KevJumba pleaseeeee! And bring Paco back he’s funny and interesting
I have an iPhone 6s and I'm just waiting for the day when it says "does not support iOS number blah"... I like my headphone jack and my touch ID though. In N Out is a bad comparison though because they're literally only on the West coast. I've never had them. Hardee's might be the best most national chain. But I think comparable to In N Out where I live is like Five Guys, Braum's, or Steak N Shake.


Also the sexual relations thing, I can see how incest could be legal but they shouldn't have kids. NOT THAT I WOULD EVER DO IT but I can see how that would be ok. But consent is the biggest key between human sexual relations and whether the mind is completely formed (which is 25 years of age, which really should be defined as "adult"; not 18 or 21). But unless animals or objects evolve to having the exact same mental capacity as a human, that should be illegal.
I don't mind David interrupting the others, although it is rude. My problem with David and the Apple conversation is that he's praising Apple way too much and gets defensive when Ryan and Will are criticizing Apple especially when Ryan and Will talk about iphones slowing down and getting buggy after an update releases. David only dragged that conversation for way too long trying to justify what Apple is doing. In the end he just says that Apple isn't the only one that does it. I know he admitted that he's a fanboy and that's fine but it's annoying that he's defending something so scummy for a long time.
I like the fact that you guys are talking about random stuff and being open about your opinions, it's a relief that people are not afraid to talk about certain things in a relaxing non-confrontational way and no one's getting triggered.
This podcast is gonna go to great places
Dear Ryan, What do you do in every morning?
Dear Ryan, can you do a conspiracy theory about 42 in the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?
Create a new video sharing website with other big YouTubers that aren't happy with the way YouTube has changed. Eventually people will migrate over for your unique content. Although YouTube is large, a small percentage of the creators capture most of the viewership.
I will draw for like 4 hours straight and I listened to both of these and can you guys please make more because it is really nice and interesting to listen to when I am working😁
One small critique: David kept talking over Ryan/interrupting and that stresssssed me out and he didn't seem to be digesting the other's points 

But great podcast! Can't wait for the next one
This is ass but keep it up lol
I wish you could state your power points and conclusions faster so I’m just gonna try to skip to the ads
Dear Ryan, please make another BgA song
I just can't wait for the next one 🙃
I don't think the iPhone has really changed that much. It looks better now but I will always prefer Android phones.
Ryan, your podcasts are great and I've enjoyed watching them [even if I've been watching backwards as I catch up], but damn your guest is annoying as hell.
This talk makes me feel so much better that I've never got an iPhone.  I've never used any Apple products.

Ryan Higa - From once a month to 4 times a week
Along with software outgrowing past hardware, most technology also has what is called planned obsolescence.
watching this before sleep :)
Also it's not the same problem with every phone company. My Samsung didn't slow down until 4 years after I was using it, and even then it was because I ran out of memory.
Dear ryan, what if a giraffe drank a cup of hot tea. Will it cool down the tea because of the long neck
"You know how many 8 people is?!"
This podcast went nowhere and everywhere!! I love it!
No more David in Podcast please if he's advertising apple, just cut it out...
ME at 52:26 that is so me, and at 1:00:15 I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT TOO, like what if that happens
This is why android is better
Dear ryan please do an off the pill pocast with Arden Cho
Hmm idk I'm seeing david different now
Goes back to the easily butthurt people video where he talked about YouTube......still relevant
Next topic...  Anti-vaxxers are crazy and are ruining medicine
This channel is the foam of the beer of YouTube
David straight up wasn't understanding Ryan's argument
I love this off the pill podcast, keep it up 👍
Uhhh Einstein DEFINITELY knew what gravity was, just FYI
Love the podcast please keep it up
David really doesn't understand Apple's planned obsolescence. It was really tiring listening to them talk and make excuses for that 1 TRILLION dollar company. 

Apple doesn't need more excuses. Apple needs to do better.
Me listening to this podcast in my car: Are we still talking about Apple right now?
Ryan do more parkourse please i miss the vids
why does this podcast sound like a convo between my friends. lol.
Old iphones aren't necessarily slowed down by the new software. Apple stated that they decrease performance to improve the battery life of the lithium ion batteries that have a limited lifespan
I always thought Will looks like a guy that would work at Whole Foods
I don't usually listen to podcasts. Thanks to this, now I do.
David vs ryan higa and will is apple good or not
Coming in feb4
Yes, let's discuss incest then mention then at the middle of the topic mention over and over "first of all I would not do that" it's REALLY not suspicious at all <.<.
DEAR RYAN, can you make a parody on thank you, next
He said this is why we mostly have male subs and I'm over here a female eating and not even bother by the poop 💩
Only the six seemed to get super buggy when the future phones came out, 5 and 7 still seems fine :/
in some countres the age of consent is 12. Honestly that's maaaad.
David is such an apple fanboy lmao. Ryan and Will do love apple but realise the problem very well and adressed it. Idk why david is so blinded with defending apple.
Dear Ryan, can you make a classical version of taki taki
This podcast with David annoyed me more than the others tbh.
Tbh people are to sensitive these days. Being PC doesn’t really matter.
ok ngl this is the first podcast ive listened to (ever) and its solely because the title caught my attention. ive had the exact same thoughts as Ryan had in this podcast to the point where it actually felt like he was just talking out my thoughts. I skipped the whole apple conspiracy part (sorry) cause I was genuinely curious as to what Ryans thoughts on the matter would be and they are SO similar to my thoughts. something that caught me off guard tho is how David said that incest should be legal? I didn't rlly agree with some of the things he said and it kinda annoyed me that every time Ryan tried to talk, David would just jump in and say his opinion. even tho it was fascinating getting all their opinions, I was mostly just trying to hear Ryans thoughts and im so glad he didn't hold back and just said whatever was on his mind. and honeslty this podcast made me excited to hear future topics that u guys are going to cover cause ik that you'd just say what was on ur mind without caring too much about what ppl are going to say about it...
I love this podcast bc there it isn't serious at all so I can have it on and do other things while enjoying this :3 best form of productivity~
That's not really how phones work
I prefer the podcast when paco is in it😍😍
Well don't even try to play PvP mode of Dragon Ball Legends on an iPhone 6. The battery goes from 100% to 20% in 30 minutes and then the phone dies with no warning whatsoever. That's why I'm moving to a much cheaper and (supposedly) much durable (battery wise at least) Pocophone F1 xD. I love the iPhone but I can't keep up with the prices. A new phone costs more than I make in a month...
Great podcast ;) Keep it up
For me... 
The reason why I dislike Apple is the price. Cause to me, performance is great and all but you can find a phone 5x cheaper that works as fast as these high budget phones and, to me, why is this even a thing? Like is this first world problems? To be accepted into normal society, you need to have an iPhone? 
Anyways, there's just a lot of cheaper fones that can work as fast. There's no need to buy an iPhone. 

Then uh incest... IDK lol
Now I want Ryan to make a social media platform
Ryan walking dead did not end lol but I hate it so I wish it did rip
The podcasts are beautiful, funny entertaining and you’re all being yourselves instead of following rules to make videos. I’m glad you bring up topics that some deem sketchy and the fact that you haven’t changed even after all the rules that have been set on you is impressive. Also one thing that I wanted to quote was “this is why we have more male viewers” “it’s offensive?... oh well” I found hilarious glad you said it
i think the phone thing has something to do with new updated firmware that the older phones just aren't as efficient as using as the new ones, however i know apple got sued for doing something that slowed their phones down after a certain point. ive kinda always used android so i dont know too too much about it
David was kinda wrong about the update thing. That does slow the older phones, but not because of features it can't handle. Apple stated that the reason it happens is to keep solid battery life on older phones. Unfortunately they only admitted it after it was proven they did this which is why they had temporarily dropped the price to replace the battery which does get it working at full speed again.
dear ryan you should try to ice skate but with banana peels
“The foam of the beer”

I’m gonna try to fit this into my sentences now...
Well also Ryan I think that us banning and condemning incest IS politically-correct culture in a way. Us realizing the scientific reason for why incest is disadvantageous; and the moral reason for it being wrong of course is us being more politically correct. They used to do incest back in the times of kings and queens to keep pure blood or whatever; hell they probably still do that in tribes that reproduce within their own clan or tribe or whatever. So condemning incest is progressive because it is us moving forward. Us condemning homophobia and accepting gays is progressive because it is us moving forward.


lol shit idk ahaha
i really love listening to these podcast and I'm happy to see they turn out how Ryan wanted them to be :)
Some people notice glitches more and like slowness when they play more games idk why but thats how it seems to be
Dear Ryan,can you do your ultimate handshake in reverse
And there all.... 500 lbs😂
david trying to teach ryan self control
And tonight on Shower Thoughts with a Sociopath, "Is a hate crime really a crime if you hate everyone?"
I have an iPhone seven and bought it at the beginning of 2017 and it’s still working fine
WILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY 😂😂
Please keep the podcasts coming!!! Let’s strive for ATLEAST 3 times a week!! 🤣 I hate waiting a whole week! 😭
can you get brendon urie on the podcast that'll be so much fun
The conversation about Apple. The bugs are one reason that they need to update and need new patches, however the security measures are more important. The reason why older phones get slower is because of the updates yes, and the hardware sure. The baseline is creating those larger encyrptions, and security measures so that information still stay private and pushing what they want for the phone and its users. They want to keep everything fine and safe, having holes and loose ends could be even more critical. Apple should take some time to figure out how to build there hardware that can match there software more and more down the line. I personally have had both and I ended up going with samsung because it was just a bigger bang for my buck. Apple was great, but since you all are kind of one sided in this whole conversation you might want to try out other phones. The packaging is one thing, but the product is another. P.S. I haven't had one problem over the last 2-3 years now with samsung.
Honestly I think he should start rapping and producing music. He's got the skills and he can surprisingly rap really fast.
I watched this video with airpods
I love podcasts💗😀
It's great you guys further into topics people are afraid to talk about
david is protecting apple 😮
"GET EMM"
This is my history class. We started talking about Noble Names and ended up having a biology lecture about how babies are made. IT WAS WEIRD!!
This podcast is the right enough foam of the beer.
I love how ryan is so active these days
For the intro you should do the opposite of breathing out into the mic, you should inhale into the mic...
Where did ASMR come from? It literally was never a thing, then all the sudden in one day everyone I know knew about it, and it was everywhere on my feeds
the more i watch these the more i realize will is just a bean and we need to protect him
I think shi-shi (or however you spell it) is a Portuguese thing, which would explain how it got to Hawaii. My Portuguese family are the only ones I know of who say it.

Also, there are two reasons I can immediately think of to discourage incest. First, there's the possibility of manipulative grooming of young kids by older relatives which constitutes a violation of free choice. Second, genetic issues associated with incestual procreation make incest undesirable from an evolutionary standard. 

Be aware that incest is something that right wing bigots conflate with LGBT marriage as a reason to attack it. Don't fall into the same trap. They aren't the same and don't belong in the same discussion.
dear ryan
can you do a pingpong trickshot?
What is my dude smoking?
As a software developer, everything David said got under my skin D:
If your apple device slowdown without update, you need to replace the battery.
"There is a difference between making money and being greedy" 
I mean... wise words
Really similar issue with my 5c. I always get my phones right before/after the new one comes out and my 5c literally fried itself to where we couldn’t get any information off the phone 6 months after I got it. I had to borrow a 4 from a family friend for the next year and a half and had no issues with it except the battery life and overheating (known issues with that phone).
Ryan, I want to watch these but these are too long. Can you make a mini episode?
18:20 - 57:31 is all the Apple conspiracy stuff for anyone who wants to skip past it after a bit; you're welcome.
Android always releases new software and their phones dont slow down...at least in my experience
what could happen in the future is people actually feeling compassion for pedofiles, most of theese people where abused kids anyways... and maybe the problem here is to educate our kids better and not (for exemple) force them to kiss people that they think are gross, this way we are making it easy for anyone to mess with the kids without them being able to set clear boundries
and by the way, depending on what country or time we've lived, being gay or being non white has been ok most of the time
California native here, In-N-Out is trash and overrated. Johnny Rockets for the win!
Love these podcasts, yo!!
Dang You're uploading a lot more now
On the iPhone vs android topic, I use android, I have had a galaxy for the past 7 or 8 years and have only gone through 3 of their phones. My systems did not slow down the way my families iPhones do. I dont have nearly as many updates "required" and by time I switched phones it was just because I wanted to or cracked a screen so I took the chance to update, but my software never started to slowdown or anything like that the way apple does. Love ya David but you are wrong on saying all companies do it the same way because they don't.
In finland we have a joke saying "mitä serkumpi sitä herkumpi" whitch means the more cousin the more of a treat they are... Really. It's not like we encourage incest but we have that saying for some reason.
dude this is great  and im only 16 min in ha
I thought of Apple the fruit so I was so confused
You should have a female as a special guest on the next podcast. 

Edit - I am a guy and I would like to see the opinion(s) of a girl when asked questions like these. 

(Note) That is why.
I was surprised they didn't touch on robots
Maybe skip the tech talk next time, yikes...
Honestly Apple slows down the phones on purpose so that people have to buy new ones. I like the podcast but its painful hearing you talk about it like its a mystery.
The world needs JESUS
2:53 “grab your sleeves”
yo i was eating dinner when they started talking about the dog poop sandwich would you rather..
They’ve mentioned us. Filipinos. Hahaha.
man i played this vid in the bg while i did stuff and swear 80% of the vid was apple talk lol
Nobody asked for my input, but your discussion kinda made me think. So since it was induced by you, I feel like I need to tell you. 
Pedophilia should not be able to cross the illegal boundary to the legal one because if we see the pattern in the legalisation of the things you guys gave example of (gay marriage and all else LGBTQ+ things), they can make their case by saying this is the way they were born and love is love. But what pedophiles feel are sexual attraction to children. That's it. Which doesn't even come near to the definition of "love" that we all talk about. They are attracted to how someone would look from blah-age to blah-age. They don't really have a case here. That is, if we are sticking to the strict basic definition of pedophilia. The pedophilia that you guys mentioned -18yr old married to 50yr old - is not something that can be illegal since it slips through the loopholes in the law. There is a whole power imbalance thing working here which might push people, including me, to call the older person a pedophile. But they aren't really; in strict terms. The only reason a big age gap is a problem is because it introduces power imbalance in a relationship. Not that it happens in all such cases, but it's pretty common and is something I saw for myself aaaand the reason why I am not totally on the whole "age is just number" boat. But that's out of topic and I rambled long enough, I should stop. (Sorry in case my English is not proper) 

Loving these Off The Pill podcast, Ryan.
PUT MORE ADS PLEASE
The phone does slow down its just up to you to put up with it until you can afford the new iphone. I have a 7+ and its got some issues but i can still do everything i was doing since i got it years ago.
I am on Ryan and Will's stance on Android and Apple issue
Hey Ryan when BgA gonna come back?will you make another song?
had no notifications but still early haha
I love  RHPC gang. But I also hate those people who complain about something and keep doing the same thing. If you like Apple,  then use it. Don't like it? - Don't use it. Simple.
the new content lately is so so awesome i’ve been watching consistently since the first videos and i think he needs to just keep producing videos that he really wants to make
Oh wow. I'm not the only one who thought this podcast isn't quite good. I don't hate it. But I don't love it either. Maybe its David or maybe its the fact that they didn't seem to be talking about anything until halfway into the podcast. But i was definitely left wanting more but not I'm a good way more like..."that's it? Its over?"
I kinda wanna see a Sean or SlopsMcgee episode. Or maybe an Arden Cho episode.
where is the ASMR part?
"if you wanna marry your cow you should be able to" a dude in india actually did this
You guys could start off the podcast with a round of Would You Rather or some other game like and just see where things go
Don't worry Ryan I'm still here and I'm a girl.
Dear  ryan can you do a dobble back flip.sorry if my spelling is wrong.tnx
android is honestly just as good as apple and has less issues with its product, but apple is such a huge brand name and community that people refuse give androids a chance. Sort of how there are superior laptops out there but your average college student will automatically have a macbook
You could make a spear with a axe!
Sean should be a special guest
The BGA caps tho ughhhh WE NEED TO BRING BGA BACK ASAP
I got really annoyed at how they talked so much about phones without having proper knowledge. If they were better informed it would have been a good discussion.
Why do these podcasts barely have views
I'd choose an ax so i can make a spear out of wood with my ax and then ill have both
meanwhile android users are laughing at iphone users finally figuring out the system
David going on about Apple stressed me out so much dear god I can only watch until 39 minutes
ryan says MELK not milk
Upload on sound cloud
Regarding their incest conversation... Even now I question myself if I should voice my opinion on such topics...it crosses my mind that maybe I shouldn't, are people going to label me as close minded? Or maybe I will get cyber ridiculed for saying it... Then I think, wow society has come to this...we claim to be more and more open minded, but yet strike with fear of being closeminded. It is a double edged sword.
So the reason that older iphones slow down isn't because they can't support the newer OS updates. That likely wouldn't happen for quite a while since IOS updates generally aren't more demanding than the previous nowadays. But instead is because the lithium ion batteries can only be charged and depleted so many times before they start not holding as well of a charge. Same with an android or any other rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. Apple knows this happens so they reduce the power output of the cpu, ram, ext., to make it so the battery lasts just as long as before. This problem was noted by apple and they said if you got a new battery installed in your phone, it would go back to original speed. Apple also offered limited 20 dollar battery replacements to people experiencing the issue, which is very discounted.

And don't call me out saying I'm an apple fanboy. What is stated above was announced by Apple themselves. I have never owned an iphone. I don't like IOS nearly as much as android. Personal preference.
Y'ALL SAMSUNG IS GREAT GIVE IT THE CREDIT IT DESERVES! I've tried both, and there really isn't a difference so WHY would I buy a more expensive product if I could buy a less expensive one with the same quality. Ofc Apple products have better cameras but personally I don't use cameras that much.
Watch out H3 podcast!
"full of beans" is something people say all the time in NZ, usually about hyperactive kids eg "Ben's full of beans today" I thought that was a saying everywhere but apparently not. 
Maybe it comes from the idea of eating canned beans and it's giving you energy... eating baked beans is a big thing in NZ for meals while camping, normal breakfasts, etc I think every kiwi probably has a can of baked beans hiding somewhere in their cupboard.
Im gonna say the N word




Nigahiga
Team samsung! Anyone else??
To be honest? Yeah there should be more phone companies instead of apple. Give me orange, banana, green bean, whatever. Yeah. But I don’t want youtube to have competitors because I like going to one ☝🏾 place and being able to watch everything in one place. Youtube is like a mall and every single shop is a different youtuber. I like going to one mall and being able to buy everything from it. Imagine having to drive to all the different shops- that’s just too much hassle. Do I agree that Youtube is abusing the viewers and creators and taking advantage of their platform too much? Yeah. Do I want a solution for that? Definitely. But Idk man 😐
Will’s “no” about David’s in n out and McDonald’s analogy lol
Is the volume really low for anyone else?
whenever ryan talks about the LGBT+ community he gets one viewpooint wrong and is offensive. just dont talk about it.
When they start talking about incest being ok one day, my immediate thought. Oh murder will be ok one day too then
My Android is 3 years old and I've dropped it countless times, and it's only slowing down now because the storage drive is 1 gb from being full and probably because of minor damage from dropping it without a case many times xD
I'm surprised how much Ryan knows about different industries like Apple and Youtube. Great business acumen.
I think if you keep posting more activity like you’ve been doing for the past month I think you could catch up to pewdiepie! Honestly i like your vids a-lot better than his
bro I could watch these for hours
i love your  vids
The easy solution in my opinion is just to not update your phone. The software updates aren’t required
Dear Ryan / can you make GTA5 trailer
David does not know how phones work, his fanboy is showing
The exact reason why I left apple, from my iPhone 5 to 5s to 6s all quickly became glitchy (Within  a year)... then I moved to BlackBerry Z10 and it lasted for at least 3 years, now I'm on Samsung S9 plus and so far so good 👍🏾.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Apple forces you to update your software. If you'd like to, can't you keep the same software that was on the phone when you bought it?
Boi, I AM Filipino
Shishi is Portuguese for pee maybe that's where it came from
Bring back Paco!!
AHHHH A NEW EPISODE SO SOON YES!!!!! And please bring back Paco!
I MISSED DAVID
I don't know if it's me or someone else that noticed that Will last name Shayhan was missing a 'y' 2:04
I really wanted them to discuss the incest/pedophilia topic more, I’ve also been thinking about these topics and its so refreshing to hear people discuss it because it is a really interesting topic. Really enjoying these podcasts so far!
David keeps saying that Apple uses higher quality to make their phones, but he's never even held a Samsung flagship. This is kind of one sided, I myself use a Samsung even though my family and friends use iPhones and I feel that my phone is way better and comfortable than theirs because of the curved edge. I use a Samsung Galaxy S8 and it's about 2 generations old and it hasn't slowed down a bit. David also said that Android slows just like an iPhone, but it's not true. Anyways keep up the good work love u Ryan (no homo). Like if u agree
The floor is lawa

David is like my gf. We are talking about something and I really wanna bring up a point connected to the topic but she just doesn't stop. When eventually she takes a breath by that time she took 3 different turns in the conversation and now we  are talking about something totally different.
hey ryan any plan to continue that parkour series
yes. u should do dirty ones once in awhile!
sorry not sorry, I hate apple x) The furthest in I got into Apple was an iPod from way back in like 2008-2013.. but thats just a separate storage and battery for music & mp3 players as a separate entity has not been updated (which I think people should keep making, for a solid population like kids to keep them off a phone before going onto a phone) so Ipods are the best option. --- I digress about ipods; I'm a galaxy user, just updated to Galaxy S9 this past Christmas - Apple's too boring, too simple imo. I love what I can do with my Android, all the options and creativity. The texting background of iPhone is so boring to me; I love that I can be creative with my keyboard background, messaging background, text font, the style of the apps on the home screen (themes and widgets), ringtones of whatever I want (from any game/anime/show/etc). I would hate a company restricting my creativity. Apple is also super strict in terms of using other products; I can branch out with Android to other products and they still work fine together.
incest with parents should be illegal because of the power dynamic
i love these podcasts! keep them up!
JUST STOP FOLLOWING THE CROWD!
what voice app are they using on the laptop behind will??
ryan I make these arguments about 20 years from now what will we accept!
This is Ryan’s iq

Dear Ryan can you make a song about ketchup.PLZ🥫
9:52 lol Ryan’s pidgin coming out
Dear Ryan can you do some slime trick shots
Ryan uploaded more than twice a month? Is this real?
You shold make another channel kust for this podcast
Want to thank Ryan and Will for showing at David podcast. For real never saw a lot of David personality even being an old school fan so this was a good insight.
I live in the UK and some people here say "full of beans"
I genuinely thought one of them would support incest
I just wanted to say that these are really great! I’ve never been a huge podcast person, but I could listen to these for days. I sometimes listen to these while doing homework, and I honestly enjoy listening to your podcasts more than music now. I really hope you guys continue with these types of videos
David defending apple, speaking over ryan and will and just not being entertaining makes me like him a lot less.
I thought David would be funnier in this
Am I the only one that gets goose bumps when they do the outro?😂
Holy crap I made it before it got 5 views... there is a god!
Dear Ryan, can you make a video kinda like the avengers but with an own invented super hero squad with lame super powers (like will's idea on the other podcast: growing hair instantly long etc.)?
26:32 - I know what ur talking about!! That’s the motto motto phone ! I was so excited because it was going to be so Eco-friendly and money saving well still getting a great experience! So sad,idk they shut down the 2 pilot they had such great reviews from their test subjects ages 12-45 .
love the podcast!!
I do understand what they were saying about how far PC culture will go. Actually, I had this conversation a while ago and it surprised me that other people have thought about it too
Don't even need to watch the video, the title is enough entertainment and curiousity.
Dear Ryan can you make a horror movie trailer about You
?
Algebra 1? I did that in 7th grade man...
Ya right everything is a sine and cosine graph,it went same for your channel as well.
IN'N OUTS THE BEST!
this podcast really grabs my sleeves
Best podcast ever
I love Off the Pill segment. That’s all.
im gonna use 2:29 as a meme thank you
I mean like moving along is nice, but discussion and arguments feel more real when they progress and not just cut off for the sake of something, personal preference i think. And also i had iphone 5s while the 8 was coming out and it was doing fine. I just stop updating after about a year because i dont NEED the improvements whatever they are (seems like just the camera at this point) and it functioned completely fine, fits in pocket nicely as well
The other Problem is in how they force you get you to upgrade, they actually tamper with the old device's workings in SECRET, by making you think you battery is dying or your processor is going slower by releasing a firmware patch or update. They purposely make exploits and security issues to scare you into getting a new phone. One issue that they caused was to accidentally release over 50,000 apple users info to hackers in certain countries I dare not say from a update. That's why I don't like and trust Apple products anymore because their network is no longer secure especially their Cloud network. Do you think its by accident that their Cloud Network is always being being hacked, ha! To answer a certain a certain person's question in this podcast, yes, they do have people to do or can do those things you mentioned. BOOM!
The Podcast is the best thing thats ever happened to this channel.
I hate the fact that Ryan gives up on important subjects so easily because bigger companies are taking care of them
this is just Ryan: Unscripted
I love these podcasts, they speak so freely  and calm

Dear Ryan can you do exact instructions challenge.
It was hard to listen to David going on about Apple without actually having an open mind
Man these ppl know nothing about phones other than apple 🍎
Make a video with Sean again just once
can you not talk about moldy tacos while i eat plz
i love these podcasts pls keep them up
yes, apple phones were slowed down by new updates. Yes, apple got in trouble for it. Apple is also trying to rectify it by releasing a new update (few months ago) to help the speeds of older phones. Don't sit there and tell me that your old samsung phone isn't slow...I know for a fact that they are.
59:17

Incest part
You r make more and more videos
😂😂😂😂
When ur anti apple but still use it :v
I like that they went in on the smartphone and apple topic but a good chunk is off-base; bring mkbhd or another techtuber to discuss tech again, as well as other stuff
I like how Ryan is negating David's opinions on apple
ryan cursed?!?! 😱😂
omg i used 2 say shi shi as a kid too im from singapore
please keep paco in all podcasts
52:27 best part
Im using a Samsung Galaxy S4 for 2 years now and the phone got released 2013 so a phone thats a  6 year old phone that works pretty good considering all the apps and files have increased in size and I also have an iPhone 4S which is older than this Samsung but I cannot use it since it cant handle the update
I say Samsung is better but I can also see why people like iPhone
About the iPhone talk. I had iPhone for years. Within those 5 years I bought 4 phones....that's a phone pretty much  every year, reason is exactly what you were talking about, the slow processing because of updates. I since then switched to Samsung....6 years...and I have only bought 2 phones.
This podcast tells me how unaware of technology celebrities are..

Competition drives prices down and encourages innovation. A monopoly would enable a single group, business, or corporation to control prices, enabling them to cut down on quality while raising prices. Apple most definitely needs competition to drive them to do better.
Incest is a mistake because it causes birth defects, creating a problem for society. Bestiality can cause people to get certain sicknesses or diseases, creating a problem for society. It's for the greater good of the people to keep those things illegal.
Wait a second. Please do not talk about Apple like they want to change something. The only thing they try to change is the money on their bank account into even more money... The only reason their technology gets a little better from year to year is because they have to do at least something to make it different from the phone before.

And talking about a fast food restaurant and "quality" just drives me nuts. Sorry...but does anyone really thing, that (in your own words) the "Apple" of Fast food restaurants, has a high quality meat in their burgers? If I had an headache I would eat that burger, only because there is more medicine in it than in every painkiller I could consume...Will and Ryan seem to respect thosee things, but your guest seems a little blinded by capitalism and marketmanipulation...

Edit: And of course: compared to McDonalds in america, everything is high quality. But that doesn't make an "in 'n Out" Burger premium food...in the end its "garbage", that they serve us, which doesn't cost them 5% from what we pay

Sorry... but have a good week guys
ok but i need a bga comeback
Why are you trying so hard to sell apple to us?

From an environmental perspective it's really gross how they make you have to buy the newer phone. But honestly, I think most companies do this. They're never gonna get me though because I always buy my phone second hand anyway.
0:55 I thought they were gonna sing the DK Rap 😂
Personally I find android phones incredibly easier to use. Half of my family deals with iPhones and I find the whole interface annoying. That,  and they don't even have a back button. Fun fact: iPhone is actually third on the list of most bought phone.

Paedophilia is already being normalised. There's been a Ted talk where a chick talks about her friend who is a paedophile (people who are attracted to prepubescent children) and how lovely he is. I will tell you now; I will never accept anyone who is sexually attracted to kids, never look at it as "love is live" or equate it to the gay rights movement. There aren't two consenting parties, and therefore should not be legalised.

As for incest, to me it is absolutely disgusting. But,  I am libertarian in the sense that I'll let people do whatever the hell they want as long as it isn't harming anyone else. However if we were to ban people from having kids in the sense if it being incredibly harmful medically for their children,  should we also not give gay's that same right considering the best environment for them to grow up in is one with both a mother and father? It's an incredibly slippery slope.
I still say “I gotta shishi”
i feel like david doesn't properly absorb what will and ryan are saying which is why the rants are overly and unnecessarily long with the same points being constantly repeated
I have only had two phones in my life. An iPhone 5C for 4 years and for the past 2 years, I've had a 7. Not once have I experienced this whole new update or new phone slows my phone down stuff. In fact the only reason I got my current 7 was because I cracked the screen on my 5C and decided I might as well get something new rather than repair the current phone.
Full of beans is a common phrase in england and it mean full of energy
At the end of the day, the potential of having kids through incest is 100% enough for it to remain illegal.
They used to cap the iOS updates until iOS 6; iOS 7 then went to all of the newer phones.
Can Sean do an episode pls


I miss him.
That modular phone was a Google project named project aero I believe. I think it launched and then died quietly.
Dear ryan can u make full version of Pokemon horror movie
Just saying, I had the same android phone for 6 years and it didn't start slowing down until the very end.
Okay Ryan my iPhone is the newest one  and it was fine before and I just finished your podcast it’s glitching wth ////:
Dear Ryan can you do badminton trick shots
Dear Ryan can you beatbox like a pro
This is the problem with Apple fanboys. They don't listen to rest of the world when the smartphone market is literally dominated by android. The update slowing down other phone is simply not true. It may be true for some cases but there hasn't really been an issue with the software update slowing down the phone. Android users have much more flexibility regarding software. Simply if you have the money and like the simple design of Apple's products then buy it. If you want a wider variety of phone that offers better specs for a lower price get Android. Its a matter of preference at the end of the day. I have a Macbook but I still prefer non Apple phones simply because they have performed better on a daily basis.
Ryan, I like the controversial stuff xD keep it up
Dang. This made me think about the future and the way society will become. Also, I have an iPad 4 (I think) which I got in 2013 (I think) and I still use it to this day. I use everyday as an alarm and I think that it's great. I can definitely relate to the keyboard problem. I have a Samsung but I only have an iPad because it was a gift. Otherwise, Android for forever.
The clap in my head was meme review
apple can not be the cheap and best quality made brand bc it's neither of those, try an top or even mid tier android phone and then make a proper statement. talking only on the hardware side, apple is falling behind in a lot of places not only on mobile. (except the trackpad of the mac)
Axe body spray "ew get away zombie" hahahahahaha
RYAN DO YOUR PART AND MAKE A PEWDIEPIE VIDEO WE MUST SAVE HIM!
Good podcast 😁
Can you do another anime in real life
Regarding the apple conversation, David was saying how the process of releasing a new phones and slowing olders models was something shared across the industry, I'd argue its very different with android since most phones have the specs to handle updates it's just getting them that's the issue but Google's haven't only acknowledged that it's not possible to continually upgrade hardware but actually made an attempt to find solutions. They've started the android one initiative as well as android go. This basically means I have a £130 smart phone that will last me 2-3 years because Google grantee updates for it
the apple part was hella boring
Well this podcast was the foam of the beer
You can't really compare "Android" to "Apple iPhone". Android is only the operating system. If you really want to compare iPhone physically  such as the phone overheating or battery life, you'd have to compare them to the actual phone manufacturer such as Samsung, Google,  Sony, LG, etc.. Unless you want to compare the OS then you cannot compare the whole iPhone to Android itself but you have to compare IOS vs Android.
Also, I agree with Will that In N Out is not Apple, INO still manage to have at least at a very decent quality with fairly low price unlike Apple who increase the price of their phone drastically.
Also you have to pay for a lot of the apps / game apps on iPhone but a lot of the games I've noticed that are on iPhone are free on Google play.
I use Samsung myself, and I only recently managed to switch from a s6 to an s8 (newest phone is s10) and for like a year I've been using the s6, the battery was super weird, like it could jump from 1% to like 7% and things like that
If you really have no idea for the intro, i suggest making a subreddit. So we can like leave our entries in the sub reddit bros and you'll watch submission in the next episode of lwi.. i mean otp podcast
OMG love listening to you guys talk about eating dog poop !
Dear Ryan can you do a nerf war

Incest shouldn't be illegal. Even if tthere is risks with having children, there are risks with having children when you're disabled or over 40.
I miss the old Ryan like the old days of skittzo n stuff
Dear Ryan, can u do a parkourse video

Incest and pedophilia are wrong because they hurt people. Being black or asian or gay or bi or trans or muslim or latin doesn't hurt people. But incestuous relationships are more likely to be unhealthy and psychologically traumatizing (most obviously due to power dynamics between parent and child or older and younger siblings), and even if it's not, a child created between close relatives is significantly more likely to have harmful birth defects. Pedophilia obviously traumatizes children, but it can also seriously hurt or kill a female child if they become pregnant because their bodies can't handle it. I honestly think incest won't get much more acceptable, and pedophilia will never be acceptable. The idea that people could defend either of those is disturbing.
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GAT THE NEW VIDEO FOR BGA?
Full disclosure I am an Android fan lady but every arguement tactic that David uses when Ryan or Will told a negative personal story about apple or brings up an opposite viewpoint and responds with "I've never experienced that", "It was probably just that phone", "It's more than just that" just grinds my gears. Its impossible to carry on a discussion with a person like this. His stubborn denial and lack of facts just leads them all in circles and it creates frustrated audiences. ... and they kept talking about food. So now I'm just hangry.
Incest can lead to higher chances of disorders
58:31 I’m a kid and I remember asking my mom to play that game on her blackberry and it was the best
this is gonna grab my sleeves
Bruh david just isn’t listening to what the others are saying. At least be respectful and patient in a discussion like this.
As much as I love David and his content, I honestly wish he wasn’t in this podcast 💀🤭🤷🏻‍♀️
Dear Ryan,  I noticed in the comments people were complaining about others not listening. I recently watched a Stanford video about listening, the challenge was to speak to someone by spelling out everything you say. I think you should try it in a podcast. I c-h-a-l-l-e-n-g-e y-o-u
David choi is kinda bias bruh -_-
Incest deforms your baby. King tut had a flat head, huge hips, and a stubbed foot. He died at 18 cause it literally kills the baby.
I love how you even in the first podcast ans now you ended up on the sexuality theme. You gotsomethingyou wanna share?
Get Arden in the next podcast!!!!!
11:21 my life in a nutshell
I’m fine with YouTube being clean because imagine the trash that it would become... and I’m 26y/o. Also, if you’re going to be putting out R rated content then it’s targeted for older viewers so yes it should be age restricted, and if you argue against that, than you’re doing so because you’re thinking about views not viewers.
Hey random people scrolling through comments
I just wanted to let you know that you are 4:59
anyone remember parkourse
36:12
1. "Why would apple spend millions of dollar more for a team to fix IPhone 6?"
2. "Yes, they need another team to dedicate themselves for IPhone 6"

Yeah and you have no idea what you are talking about, it's better to be silent than state something you clearly have no idea about. Jesus it is painful to listen to.
Dear Ryan can you do paladins trailer?
Sheeshee is used in Singapore too 😂😂
Make it a official podcast
I am on my android that I just bought because I just notice that theirs no complaints about it
Hey Ryan, huge fan here since 2012, when I moved from HI to CA to go to college. You probably get tens of thousands of these, lol. But, I am still gonna say I love the thoughts behind what you put into every video. And sometimes, I feel the same as you (since day 1). I just wanna say, I really enjoy watching your video, the deep, the cheesy, the stupid, the funny ones, all of it (probably because I grew up with them in similar background). Let's get back to my train of thoughts (it feels like I am off the pill, too, lol)... all the points that you guys mention are spot on. Some I might have thought about years ago, too. I just wanna say "no, you guys are not crazy" and that I love that you stay true to yourself and being opinionated about these kinds of issue on the youtube community is rare, but it really brings awareness to people!! Go Ryan! :P
shee shee is also used in korean lol
oh yeah yeah
Okay so here's the thing on apple, they're a great BUSINESS. Not a great phone company, which is why I used my iPhone 5s for almost 5 years and then it was so buggy that I had to get a new phone, so I decided to make the switch to android because 1 all my friends used android. 2 because I didn't want to get sucked into the problem of having to buy a new phone every year
Apple actively slow down phones so you buy a new phone, which is messed up and why I switched.
Competitors to the iPhone are Sony, and Samsung.
Samsung more so, than Sony but Sony have a better phone which doesn't slow down or become buggy
Almost watched the first one until I saw paco on the thumbnail
Apple constantly releases new software updates on to all phones, with no other intention then to slow down the old products. The features they add with each software update are miniscule. Rather than creating a cap for a specific software update a phone can reach, they allow each phone to be over crowded with useless data the user never wanted when they first bought it. They only do this so each phone will slowly become obsolete, to the point where they'll be forced to upgrade to the newest iPhone. The only thing stopping them from switching to Samsung products is the simplicity of having their data already on the apple cloud.
Can you watch rap battles of history

Love this podcast! So awesome that we get one per week! Edit: You're literally the only channel for which I have notifications on. YOU'RE MY ONLY ONE, RYAN. I can barely believe it.
What microphone?
1:15:46 so math is related to real life 😂
Most Androids are pretty sleek
15:58 ryan drank that redbull like he was in a redbull commercial
oh yeah yeah
This sounds like what I discuss with my best friend whenever we have time. It's strange to thing that these things are considered "controversial" nowadays.
Ryan talk about how pakistan attacked india
You guys don’t know what your talking about when your tech your basically saying the opposite of what’s true like ween you talked about your cousins phone they would replace any device that is current for no charge
Incest is illegal primarily for health reasons. Main reason is since the genes are so similar it makes it more likely for the child to have genetic defects. It gets worse as it happens more down the family line (so if children born of incest have a child with each other the child is worse off). There was a documentary that concluded that Tutankhamen died mostly due to being a product of incest
Just for clarification sake...

Pedophilia is legally defined as the attraction to prepubescent children. Hebephilia is attraction to early adolescent children (ages 11-14). Ephebophilia is the attraction to later adolescents (ages 15-19).

Because of news sources reporting on pedophilia quite a bit at one point people took the term to simply mean attraction to children, regardless of what age that is.  Also, because of those who acted upon those desires, it became synonymous with child molesters in general. So, if you wanna get technical, it's not just pedophilia which people are so disgusted by.

Also, I do think that pedophilia is a mental condition - potentially a disorder - which could be resolved with therapy. However, I do think the way society currently looks at it is preventing it from being properly researched to find out what would actually help people who suffer from it. At best all one currently can get is to sit down with a professional and talk about it, but what mostly happens instead is people try and hide it and many eventually lash out and act on it because they aren't getting proper treatment. It's unfortunate, really.
Keep it up :)
Lolol and here I am with my iPhone 5s 😂 Still alive~
I guess the whole concept of when one is truly 'grown up' is so vague and could easily be changed - who is to say that a 20 yo is more able to make decisions than a 15 yo
However, societally, we obviously need a distinction, a concrete barrier, and thus, unless the concept of adulthood is abolished, pedophilia will probably remain illegal due to the inability of the underage participant to consent - although regulations on this are obviously differing throughout countries
In Germany we have the following regulation: from 14 years onward youre allowed to have sexual relations with people up to 18 years old, from 16y onwards you can have sex with anyone over 14, and from 18 onwards you can only have sex with people from 16y onwards
Ryan I understand that your audience is mostly very young...but maybe if you keep feeling like you have to restrict yourself you should consider pivoting and creating content you 100% agree with. Your audience may change as well as the size of you audience, but maybe that's better than creating unauthentic content?
android 4ever😉
I’ve had both Samsung and Apple, my current phone, which is an iPhone 5s mega old, and I have to agree that my Samsung worked so well with little to no issues, the only reason I switched was because I had the chance to upgrade, my iPhone however I’ve had to fix at least 4 times in the few years I’ve had it.
I love love love this man
I really wish Ryan didn't feel restricted by youtube in terms of the content or language he could talk about. I feel like the majority of his fan base has grown up with him over the past and that if he did go into more adult like topics the podcast would be a lot more entertaining and real. Still enjoying it but a man can dream
I liked Ryan ❤❤❤
16:00 return here.
Make more cooking but not really
I can’t the harmony! Hahaha i loveit
For the most part, Everyone reaches 18, but no one changes their species.
WHERE ARE THE ADS?????
I want the old ryan back
7:30 , honestly, me too
Damn Ryan is going full power with his uploads
I work in Cellular. Deal with MANY MANY iPhones. It's beyond "true in some ways". There are many times I have to leave someone's iphone to update because there a few weeks past; and the device is very buggy or even failing to receive reception anymore. Updates are critical to the device working properly
Dear Ryan can you play a otomatone
AR Engineer does not make that much money lol
The end of this took a crazy turn. There are SOOO many factors yall... with age and incest there are psychological factors, early development in many ways, etc. Like yall...cmon.. XP but interestingz nonetheless P.S. Animal Analyst....>>>...Animalyst x) and ayee shout out to Kina <3
He stretched the video to put ads
david is just an apple fanboy
I really wanted to join in the discussions. So hard to just listen!
I used the same samsung S4 for almost 4 years and its still perfect. In the 2nd year i broke my screen and insurance repaired it, worked the same. I dropped my phone from the 6th floor in a hotel and it died (duh) .. That was my fault. Im using the Samsung S7 for 2 years now...
Yeah no David
No
You should not be allowed to marry you're sister or a cow. It's illegal for a reason. Saying as long as they don't have babies doesn't work.
That's why teen pregnancies are a huge thing. If incest were legal of course there would be babies they would be damaged by genetic diseases.
It should and will remain illegal.
Dear ryan, can u do a diss rap battle with ur brother or a compliment rap battle with ur brother?
OnePlus
I feel like ryan and will are attacking the new guy and saying apple sucks ( respectfully) and the new guy is defending apple and saying " yeah, i hear what your saying... But apple is great and you should all buy one and from a financial standpoint blah blah blah and from a technical standpoint blah blah blah."
I hate Apple. But I also understand where David is coming from. It fits him and the brand is something that he identifies with.
Ryan I have a question for you IS BGA GOING TO BE BACK
PLEASE do a video about how SUCKY the Superbowl halftime show was. You should do it in a way where you are trying to defend it but in the end realize that you were wrong.
this isn’t david so
Dear Ryan can you explain why move your arms up when you finish a trickshot
I think Incest is weird because these are people who have grown up with you and you have shared the same womb or something similar to it. Family and Romance are not things that should be intertwined with each other because many romances are temporary but blood related family is something that will remain true for your lifetime remain Regardless of genes, it’s wrong and inhumane. Also with the homosexuality comparison, I don’t think it’s fair, there’s not necessarily a movement or community behind incest, and people have tried it in history, usually it failed. Also, it is beyond stigmatic to western culture.
David is Tae with panda express
i know this is probably not going to be read but i thought about drawing the line a lot and i concluded with every relationship that is consentual should be accepted. so like for the animals no because they cant consent and also for the pedophiles no because they cant consent because they are not capable to make such choices at that age idk if this helps at all... or if it matters now...
you can feel ryan realizing that it isnt PC to say any of it
This  is  what  I  listen  to  while  I  brush  my  teeth
Who else is watching this on an apple product😂😂😂
once a blood breeds with blood (Brother, sister) when they make a baby. Apparently said baby is deformed. I read this somewhere when me and my friends had a conversation similar to this because, yes. For that reason I guess is why it is illegal but i'm 'guessing'. To be honest I think this shouldn't be a thing... Cause think of it, when THIS becomes a thing, what's next? When will it stop, it's gross to think but I have seen those 'Love is Love' things around as signs or whatever and there's Gay (Which is fine) Lesbian (Fine too) then Bestiality and then Adult with child, I also doubt it would end there. I just rather this whole thing stops where it is now BEFORE we even are in arms length of the extremes. But who knows.
I have the iPhone 6, and it has that texting bug, but like I just adapted to it and started typing and then waited for everything to type and then send it lol
really hoping david is a guest and not a regular :/
i thought the blue gray and green texting thing was if u received a text through wifi or cellular not if the other end was using an iphone or an android
Loving the podcasts. Y'all talking about interesting topics being serious and funny at the same time. It's amazing!
43:00 made me realize that you roughly spend 3 dollars a day just to own an IPhone if you buy it the day it comes out then buy the new phone on the release day. That does not include data or anything.
I love the black tape over the logo of the headphones
Super late but the phone that will was talking about is a motorola moto i saw commericals for it recently.
As a Mongolian I am confused why Chengis khaan was mentioned as a way of showing a time line. is it cuz all asians now abt him?
Wasn't the Apple thing that they do that intentionally to "improve the battery lifespan"? The battery is told to be starting to get worse after +- one year and they automatically make the choice to slow down the device so they could maintain the battery. Or at least that should be the reason they gave for slowing people's phones with new releases... Marques Brownlee was talking about this in the Joe Rogan podcast..
I don't think they realized that Apple had a huge lawsuit over the whole thing where new iOS's yearly were breaking iPhones. And they had battery changes/phone fixes for very very cheap last year for those affected (as was I and it is amazing) and with iOS 12 they fixed that whole problem of slowing/breaking down old devices!
Samsung can last for as long as you want them to
yes, android does use lower quality components if you're buying a low tier phone, but if we're talking the same price range, newsflash there are Samsung components in your damn iPhone, there are the same and somewhat crappier hardware inside the mac books when compared to what you can get building your own PC. Its ignorance of the people that are making the sales.
Just go android!!! the freedom is awesome! Apple is a prison...
Dear Ryan, can you do a comeback of BGA?
The apple topic was boring tho.
David is gonna Marry his iPhone... smh
get rid of David, and put Paco back on
I wonder how his dog Marley is.
grab yt's sleeves
Didn’t apple say they’d stop slowing their phones down as long as you change the battery?
OH MY GOD david.
that is total bs. Apple slows your phones not because software is bulkier. they do it for 2 reasons: to increase your battery life(which gets shorter as phones age), and so you buy a new phone.
--------
the only reasons one would ever buy an iphone is: 1. the os is arguably easier to use 2. you're a diehard apple fan/you want to look cool 3. because your friends all have iphones/you have other apple products and apple products are so incompatible
45:37 I thought that was just me, dang.
you are sick
Apple said they slow down their phones because they want to "extend" battery life as they get older (but the iphone after a year of use dies in 30 minutes anyway so eh whatever Apple).
They should just take a raspberry pi and turn it into a modular phone.
uhh is it just me or when did they talk about asmr?
This is my opinion.i prefer Samsung because from what I can see they have better quality for less and they have been innovating more. Apple is starting to seem like the same phone released with a different name and small changes. I feel they might fall behind. (I also lowkey feel like they are more after money than leaving the customer satisfied. And they been sus lately) apple I think needs to step it up cuz android/Google/Samsung are getting better and catching up. But whatever that's just my opinion. Comment your opinion. Dont kill each other 😤✊🏽
Also pedophilia was already okay back in the days it got wrong recently but before a 40 could marry a 15 yr old literally old erurope was that way
It is tiring to listen to a biased person talking about their bias (in any topics really). And I don’t think they will change their perspective if they can’t or not willing (consciously or not) to accept other people’s opinion and only keep forcing their own opinion.
I do bioinformatics a lot for my work, and I switched to PC last year cuz I’m getting disenchanted with Apple. But doing bioinformatics on PC is just the worst! All biology specific extensions are made for iOS. It was less then a year, and I am back to Mac because my work field is so consumed by it.
Time stamps would be perfect :)
I changed because iPhones did that shit too me all the time. However the Mac is still a superior  computer.
Not to be rude but David choi gotta go because he NEVER listens to either Ryan or Will
iPhone 16? But they are on the second gen 10 phones... 35:30
I was thinking of this whole incest/pedophilia thing w comparison w how lgbt was frowned upon too , (just thinking about it from a neutral POV) same as Ryan’s arguments and I’m so Glad he discussed it i totally get what he’s saying and his logic.
Wait STOP you are posting too much! Im not used to it XD but keep doing what your doing i actually love this XD
dear Ryan give me a shoutout
I believe pedophiles will always be seen as wrong.  Kids aren't fully developed to make those kinds of decisions.  It is traumatizing and psychologically damaging to their mental health. For this reason I don't think pedophiles will get a pass.
1:04:16 jesus christ let the man talk
This got really wierd
we need paco
The problem with incest is that you also drag in the life of an innocent child, who is now going to live as a deformed person with disadvantages through their life, and it all could have been prevented. Even if you don’t mean to, their is also the chance that the condom breaks or whatever else.
Dear ryan wud u rather pin my comment or heart it
Dear Ryan can you play a parody of centuries
20:15 I mean u cant just rival Apple tho it’s impossible at this point they’re too big of a company they’ve completely monopolized the market for phones to a point where even Samsung seems more like a shadow now than a competitor.
I don’t update my phone. Whenever the phone asks me to update I always click “remind me later” on the very bottom and when it does eventually remind me again later I click “remind me later” again. This method works for me but Idk if it will work for everyone or it will stop working? Basically ive never been “forced” to update.  The only downside is that I’m missing the newer emojis which i don’t really care about. i have a iphone 8 plus 🤳
I have the Samsung Note 4 and it's still pretty fast. It's still  almost as fast as when I got it first which was almost 5 years ago!
what mics are they using?
Hey guys, just wondering if you have used other phone brand aside from Apple? I appreciate this phone more compare to other brands that I used before though :(
Dear ryan can u remake the bahubali trailer?
Omfg Love the podcast but hated the Apple part. They are so out of touch, I guess that's why they never tried to switch
32:30 this is just so I can pick up where I left off later
Yes the phones slow down when the new ones come out but as someone who works at an iPhone repair shop just wanted to let you know that the batteries die over time. Ion batteries degrade over time it’s not apples fault
Hot Topic is a warm store...

What is David even saying in support of apple?
I love the ones with will.
yikes david has been completely brainwashed by apple
You guys are brainwashed lol
David sounds like an Apple fan boy. Completely ignorant to any suggestion to improve iPhones.
....don't like David Choi he freaks me out...
Dear Ryan, can you enact that trending music video of LoL in your own creative Ryan way? 😇The one with 4 badass KPOP looking women in a music video btw
With the case of beastiality the animal can’t give consent so we don’t know if it is in extreme pain
Dear Ryan, What is the definition of life?
1/10000 people watched the entire video before commenting
Iphones are great sure but personally i will never pay such a price for a phone when i can get almost the exact same phone from another brand for way less money. I've had my oneplus 3 for over two years and i've constantly though that yea sure i'll buy the next flagship since this one probably won't work the same by then but no, every time oneplus puts out a new phone i realize i don't need to buy a new phone because this, a phone over two years old, still works almost like a dream. Iphone users can't relate.
The thing about incest though, is that it used to be very common throughout history, especially within royal families like the habsburgs (the line ended btw because of incest; the last habsburg had a jaw so big he couldn't talk and only one testicle). So historically seen, incest is kibd of 'been there, done that, doesn't work'. So I don't think people are going to go for that again (at least, I hope they don't, or they at least don't reproduce :p)
HTC G2, Galaxy s2, galaxy s5, LG G5, and now I got a Galaxy S9. I upgrade whenever I feel like it.
Ancient Greeks were the founders of gay culture. Incest was also not a big deal. History might just rewrite itself.
Is it worth buying apple products??
I don't think so.
I think best smartphone brands are Huawei , xiaomi, Oneplus,
Wait. Lemme get this right. Apple is basically scamming it's users by slowing the phone down everytime they have a new release? I mean, I know nothing because I use android. Please no hate iPhone users. T^T
do more pleaseeee
These need to be longer.
Where’s the ASMR???
I remember when you first hit 20M but it’s like you have never moved since
The issue with incest is there can be genetic issues with children. The key word here is can and it is most noticeable in the Royal families where siblings married each other to keep the bloodline “pure”. If this sounds familiar, Voldemort’s family did this in Harry Potter too. However, this was the result of incest over multiple generations. Chances are that incest will not carry over multiple generations, so a big issue with that is eliminated.
16:41
So right about YouTube.
1:00:55 The reason it's a problem for society is because of the problems it would cause on a mass scale. Due to modern medicine many people with debilitating disabilities are able to live longer and thus have offspring. This becomes a problem when these disabilities are inborn and thus become spread through the population. Thus we already have a major pressure causing our species to be inclined to become extremely deformed both mentally and physically. To encourage widespread incest would only increase the speed at which we must take action for this via additional pressures and would likely force us to take more rash decisions leading to us, essentially, culling the weak.
Is this going to be the only nigahiga video on his channel that is under a mil?
Unpopular opinion:
I dont think its good. Not acceptable or not but incest should be discouraged. 

So this love thing, you can do whatever you want if its because you love each other or something like that, its being accepted but as a science kid, the reason its discouraged and frowned upon naturally(when youre not wxposed to that diverse of a society), is because of the evolutionary repellent that we develop since birth. We do not engage in activities which make us reproductively unfit. Sure its civilized and whatnot but its deviation from human behaviour. That is one of the major reasons why its condemned in so many religions and cultures. Its simply unnatural.


BUUUUUT what we need to understand if its the case of say homosexuality, which is equally frowned upon in religion and natural societies(what i mean by this is at basic fairly civilized society), its biological deviation. It is not normal to be homosexual. Not biologically at least. HOWEVER that DOES NOT give one the right to mistreat these humans who have deviated from normal Behaviour (evolutionarily unfit) just because someone has an extra finger on their hand, you wouldnt isolate them from the society. But guess what? Induviduals with syndromes which actually trigger homosexuality are one in a million.  So homosexuality is a choice. Its youre preference and only in those rare highly unconventional genetic disorder which causes that preference it is no longer a choice your simply born that way. So unless youre one in a million its not really possible for so many people to be homosexual rather it was their choice or preference. Which is completely Cool. Be who you want to be but just to remember that it is a sign of an unhealthy ecosystem and eventually what characteristics we classify humans under are gonna fundamentally change and we could no longer be conventional humans.
You're actually wrong about the part where you said being gay was wrong back in the day....it was kinda different with different societies.......even back in early civilisations.....being gay isn't new....
I liked apple a lot years ago and i had the iphones and the ipads and i loved them. After they started announcing a new apple phone way too often (each one more ridiculously expensive than the other) and took away the headphone spot, i switched to android. Its not even that they come up with new phones all the time, its just that the new models had nothing of importance added to them. They were just more pricey and actually worse than the once before. If they ever get their shit together i might change back to apple but at this point theyre nothing more than a status  symbol and i dont care about that shit.
Nah David Choi gotta go man. He just talking and not listening lol
Well it’s time to make a parody on Apex Legends
Ryan, could you please help Pewdiepie Bro? Your content is very creative and I am sure you could do something great here ;-)
Dear Ryan can you be Thanos?or can you make a parody of infinity war?
What's disgusting is people calling incest disgusting because they can't think for themselves with the only thing to back it up being "well because society says it's disgusting"
Have y'all never heard of OnePlus?
I felt really sad when Ryan compared homosexuality to incest.  We get enough hateful comparison to pedophiles and such as it is. I think you could definitely do with not mentioning gays at all. That felt very harmful to hear this from the person I love watching and listening to.  There are things that don't need comparison. Sometimes you guys definitely should know where to stop.
i can easily see that his enjoying what hes doing now.
its just like food it expires and i phone is just get slower
Just get like an android phone and an ipad :v why discriminate :v
Wow this video is the foam of the beer
When is the next BgA song?
I hope paco will be back!
28:06 So Apple is Drake and android and Google is all other artists
I am the Paco in my group of friends. I am still in the group but nobody likes me.
I never thought about the apple stuff like this but it is actually kinda true
The difference is we can't understand animals no matter what level of rights you want to assign an animal, we can never 100% establish that the animal is consenting.
I'm full of beans tho
Dear Ryan can you sound like 🐐
Why do you have gaming headset on
I love Ryan the Ryan says what everyone WANTS to say
David’s in TOWN! also, Ryan, I love your videos since the first ever one, I wish you were my brother or friend, (does that sound weird??) because I have a brother but I don’t want a brother that is teasing me a lot , so Ryan pls like this if you think this is weird or in your opinion 🙂
Just don't buy Apple
Ironically, Incest was more PC way back when when Monarchs still existed. It was to keep the "royal lineage". Royals only married royals. So its was super awkward when WWI happened because the British, German, and Russian royal families were all cousins are something close. Like the Tsar and Kaiser where close apparently. Yet they fought a war against each other so.
Brickbreaker is my shiiit!
Freedom without responsibility will lead to destruction. There's a reason why laws exist because when humans gain too much freedom they become irresponsible and cross boundaries which affect the whole society.
Even if I don’t update my Iphone it still slows down when a new I phone comes out.
On gang
70% of the time the camera is on david choi and its soooo annoying
I already listened to the OTP podcast on a different platform, but I came here to leave a like and a comment because I really want you guys to keep doing these!
The point "animals cant consent" for beastiality doesn't really hold up...because we eat animals all the time...they don't consent for that
I don't find offensive and I'm full of beans (cause of my name).
bring Paco back tho
Dear ryan please do a i dare you with pat from: popularmmos, and jen from: gaming with jen.
just like every single american you keep talking about your country as if it's the only one or the most important country in the world. apple has a monopoly yes but only in america. samsung is number 1 in the rest of the world. apple isn't even number 2, huawei is. also david said "in' n' out is like apple".....in n out doesn't even exist outside of america
Pedalphilia will never be accepted , lol.
The iPhone 3 was the first iPhone because it was 3gb
GUYS. I am not making this up but as I’m watching this podcast and on the apple conspiracy segment. My top header of the time and battery is gone. WTHHHHH
any one else miss the old ryan higa? I do oh yeah yeah
David is cool, but damn he is so far up apple's ass, wouldn't hear a bad thing said about it
That's why I wait a few gens before I change to a newer phone. I have the Galaxy s9 right now... probably going to wait until 11 or 12 or something before I get a new one.
It gets so wierd
45:32 that still happens with me alllllllllllllllll the time but that’s the main problem not much other stuff happens to my phone.
Dear Ryan, can you write yourself a dear ryan and respond to the dear ryan you made
Man y’all really know nothing about phones
14:48 im a girl and still here for years :)
Beans are a form of energy
I can listen to all of you all day
I had the "what if in 20 years" discussion with my dad some years ago and the bad part is I've literally seen people nowadays advocate for stuff like love has no age (regarding pedophilia) but we'll see if it develops into a bigger group of support in the future...  for now it is really remote and creepy to see
I love how you guys aren’t afraid to just speak your mind! It makes you guys feel so genuine. I have seen all your videos and I feel the passion that you have in writing! Thanks Ryan. This podcast is so good!
Lol, Apple is a business. Of course they want to make money, isn't that what businesses do? As a customer you can do your research, Apple does not deny anything about the software stuff and slowing down. You do not have to buy the product, neither does Apple has to take responsibility to meet everyones needs :p The third party repairshops are fine but the repair is no longer in control of Apple so they can't guarentee the quality of it and you loose your warrenty. Seems pretty legit to me :) love the show by the way, no hate <3
About the Apple topic, Android old phones are capped to the best software it can handle, for example some old models can be upgraded to Android 4.4 only. And everyone is happy with this since old phones owner don't get screwed. So yeah... Apple is screwing with its customers :(
This ain’t right chief

Dear Ryan fly to Canada for no reason
Never listened to podcasts before Ryan, now I love them, always watching out for your next one :)
Scrolling through the comments, it is good to see that I am not the only one feeling this way: David is straight up talking outta his ass during that segment on Apple. Of course, Ryan and Will are just working off of anecdotal evidence too, but I feel like David does not nearly know enough about Apply and the phone industry, and the tech industry to be explaining it to Ryan and Will. I get the feeling he is making roundabout points, and even contradicts himself >:(
What about hot topic?
So, the beer foam is supposed to trap the air bubbles in the beer for as long as possible to create the freshness feeling. Now if you'd tell a girl she has the right amount of beer foam, does that mean she's just fresh enough for you or that she's gassy enough for you? LOL
I n c e s t  i s  w e i r d  y a l l
Also I love hearing will talk (: I wanna hear more of ryan tho for sure. Seemed so quiet in this one 😭
dear ryan can you recreate how to be emo 2
I Don't really like those podcast , I wich you To come back on making funny videos not those podcasts are too boring , I like you Ryan But not those podcast
More skitzo
David is defending Apple to the point where he's not making sense but he can't concede that Apple are money hungry. It's proven that they purposely slow down old phones so that you have to get a new one. It's not a side effect of regular fixes and updates
Also the whole Apple thing is called planned obsolescence. U can google it but Apple is a huge offender of it
1:14:49, that's already a thing and its called specieism
Will the camera ever get off of David's face?
I dare you to swim in a pool or bathtub wearing ice fill swimsuit and goggles.
I have Huawei Honor 7 Lite and it's really good, but I can't get too much stuff to it if something breaks, bcuz they take them off the market. It sucks :/
apple is just stealing your money like blizzard is from invested Wow players. Yes they have a good product but its not worth that much.
I know when you have everything linked to your apple its nice and computers are everything but you can do that with android too you just might need a little more time. I recommend everyone who dons't like what apple is doing (even making other systems ugly). You can do that on android. I have a super old operating system on my phone and it works just fine (if it stats to drain too much just restart ez) for my use. The problem i see with switching to android is that you have too much options and don't know what is good or what is not. With apple you just get that one "shit"/"good" phone and you have to buy it.
If you switch from apple to android just be ready to have have fun with your fun a little for a while to get used to it. most of the looks you can change to how you like it probably even to your apple layout if you want.
there are good phones in android too but you can pick and choose what kind of look you want or if you want a cheap one or expensive one (that is still cheaper then apple and probably on the same lvl or close to it).

about age, incest and animals:
animals: if the animal gets intelligent enough to go through basic education human (pre-high school?) i don't care.
incest: i would only be against making children, scientists  found out that there is a lot bigger chance off having "retarded" children, there for country would not support those people, like it does now.
age: if all the schools would be better at teaching sexuality it would be easier on everyone. in Europe most countries have 15 years old (there is 14 and 16 too). If human children become better at learning logical stuff at younger age (probably not any time soon, more like 100 generations minimum) maybe when they are "family" ready. any lower might be a stretch.

Do you think there is anything that might be wrong and stands out too much, tell me how do you think about it?
Dear ryan can you  play try not to laugh with the crew
These are so cool go ryan
Jesus that dude is annoying. Please don't have him back on. Rather have Paco
The only thing with pedophilia is that there’s been studies that our brains haven’t fully developed until I think late teens. Can’t remember exactly what the ages were. For someone in early teens their brains are still different or something like that. I think that’s why the legal age limit is there. It’s good that you guys have talked about such conversations. I remember when I was younger wondering about certain things and no one else talking about them.
I am a Bengali (one of the many subcultures of India) and we say "shi shi" as well, but just to kids though.... yeah, a useful piece of information that you HAD to know.

Anyone else staring at the moving toy girl on the top left. (Ryan's pov)
2nd podcast like this and this is so damn weird XD i like these podcasts but damn this is weird and its on its own lvl
if an apple product blew up, people prob wouldn't be as upset as they were when the note 7 blew up
26:00, Huawei, Oneplus, Xiaomi and Motorola all fit the bill to me

Dear ryan can you do movie trailers in different genres?
CANT HEAR
I love these!
2:30 there is a toy dancing in top right corner
quick give pewdiepie a shoutout hes losing to t series
big fan of ryan, but sometimes it gets a little silly and pretty boring, the start was terrible and the beans thing was really being stretched, couldnt watch beyond that, hopefully the next epsiode is better like all of his great entertaining videos
4:58 UNCENSORED RYAN SWEAR!!! My life is complete!
They do realise huawei exist right?
Lol he talks about that the age difference arranged marriage things like it doesn't happen right now in India
David's intown!
Isn't there around 8 states where bestiality isn't illegal?
lol im starting to feel ryan's new vibe....
Where is poco
Am I the only one concerned about the fact that most of the comments are about Apple despite them also making it seem as though bestiality and pedophilia have the potential to be morally acceptable?? Like I know Apple was talked about for a majority of the podcast but the idea of bestiality and pedophilia being legal is horrifying
Again, GEtt emmm
I love these Podcasts and David was a great guest but I would like it if you kept Paco on along with your guests
Yes, Ryan. Thank you! You are speaking everyone's mind.
Love the Podcast, but kinda missed paco ngl
Hi Ryan i searched what time is it in your place because we have different place and time so
I search for it just to say good evening or good night. Haha
Keep it up
I am beginning to like Will more and more esp in the podcasts, he will not speak just for the sake of speaking but just when he has something significant to say. Keep it up!
When talked about beastiality, talking about how a person who's into the animal feels in love, It harms the animal. Just because the animal didn't reject you with words wouldn't mean they want to be sexually abused. 

For example if person a thinks they're in love with person b who's mute maybe. And person b never rejected person a nor accept person a or even realized person a feelings, it doesn't make it right for person a to rape person b even if person b can't say no physically. The same is for beastiality, if they can't consent, don't do it.
I thought Apple is saying that they are slowing down the CPU because the battery is degrading they want to be consistent with the battery life
I liked David this podcast everyone's mad because of the Apple comments it's really dumb and superficial
Hey Will they have those phones in UK!
I am loving this like seriously i want more its so interesting and also entertaining
You do podcasts too!!!! How did i not know....
I had the 5s for 5 years and it never slowed down all that bad even with the new software updates
When my cousin and I were 5, we agreed to marry each other when we get older to avoid the confusing world of dating.
Has David ever touched an android? Newer android phones USUALLY ALWAYS have higher quality parts. Better quality, better batteries, better screens. iPhone is only on par or slightly better in terms of cameras. Now with iPhone XR, the screen resolution is also worse. Sure it may be unnoticeable but that drop in quality should equal to a drop in price. For the premium price, Apple doesn't have good enough "stuff" in their phones to outweigh that cost.
Oh look Nigahiga is uploading a new video ,

Why is it all just songs and podcasts now. What happened to the other stuff
