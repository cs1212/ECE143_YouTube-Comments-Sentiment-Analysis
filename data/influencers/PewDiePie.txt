Felix should write a book about "Apology: Do and Don't"
He actually does give pretty valid apology reviews😂
The new video he made, he obviously watched this video and took notes
PewDiePie is number one Teacher and James now his best student because he learned quickly
PewDiePie making James apology video better than Jaques Charleston himself
Controversy: happens
Pewdiepie has joined the server
Seems like James saw this video before making his new video🙈
"Even though I sleep with earings in. That makes no since"
Me: sweats nervously
james: maybe if i speak slow everything will be ok

me: turns up speed to 2x sorry sister aint happenin
Pewdiepie's new career: Professor of Apology, with PHD

Pewds: 30 seconds could have saved James career,oopsie
Pewdiepie: here, lemme fix that for you James:

James Charles’s long pauses in his video make me want to drink some blankity bleachity
I turned on the James Charles apology video after I finally decided to watch it, and I gave up after 10 seconds.

my brain: go to pewdiepie's channel
I'm waiting for Pewds to make an apology video tier list.
I'm an older guy. 47. So I hadn't tuned in till very recently. I had to see the guy with a bazillion subs. I wasn't expecting the world, as your target viewership is much younger than I am. Not that that is bad, just different generations (for the most part).  I gotta say your name threw me off a wee bit too, lol. 
Now that I've seen your content quality; I love the name. All the little spin off names for segments is so good. Hilarious. Many things are very funny and insightful in the vids I have seen so far. **Also, this is the main reason I'm going on and on here.... It's that you are a genuine person. Wins and loses, your honesty laced with clever humor shows that you are just as a part of the human condition as everyone else. Just it is on a different level. From what I've seen so far; I have say, I like it. I'm a fan for sure. Keep it up. You're young enough. You could do anything. So much time ahead and well earned good fortune. I know it's unlikely, but I do hope you find this message in a bottle from an older fan on an island in this massive sea.
Do one now on Jeffree star. It’s comedy gold👍🏻👍🏻
Anyone notice that James Charles literally followed Pewdiepies advice on his recent video!! 😂😂
Pewd should at least have a Dr. level at this point.
sometimes youtube is like a court and felix is the judge
"He looks like he's about to sneeze." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lord pewdiepie. 

I literally have nothing else to say.

Pewdiepie: is a professional at apologize video 

James Charles: starts crying
Pewdiepie: starts laughing
I’m so glad he did this video so I don’t actually have to watch it myself
I love how he is switching between calling James he and she
7 minutes of James feel like an hour.
An hour of Pewds feels like 7 minutes.
11:14 LMAOOO
James: I don’t know what I’d do without you

Felix: Well she clearly didn’t do a good job
Apology Video Pack:

Eye blinking

Idea from Gabbage_Yt [야채 반]
Pewdiepie sounds like my English professor getting ready to drag my essay
"apparently I sleep with earrings, that makes no sense"
Wait what. Am I supposed to take them out?
yo pewds could be a pretty dang good attorney

edit: i accidentally spelled pretty as petty lol
How can they make this into a big thing when it's literally about vitamins
If you watch the video in x1.5 speed it sound almost normal...
james: crying
pewds: laughing in the same time
thanos: perfect balance

The fact that his glasses are blurry just makes me annoyed somehow
When Pewdz says, TEA TIME ya know he is perfect BRITISH boi now.

i laughed thru james’ real one
I sleep at night because ik i've never supported james charles in anyway at ALL
So James did a new video cause of this video, and now he is uncanceled. Lord Pewds can pick and choose who he desires to be uncanceled.
"Teatime yay teatime!" Sounds just like me 😂😂😂
James' apology video is actually in ASMR😂
James Charles in 2019 became Chris Crocker, the way Chris Crocker was back in 2007


Change my mind
I admit to everything. I’m sorry. I’ll keep making these mistakes. Also hi mom
Everyone just make another 10 accounts and sub to pewdiepie

(I’m not defending James Charles) 
      :)
I turned the speed to 2x because he was so slow
Spent the whole time listening to the video and looking at the comments
Omg I can't watch his video. Dear god. Who has the time to watch a kid breathing for that long and say one word per 20 seconds.
Thumbs up for PewDiePie to create an "Apologize Simulator" for smartphones & PCs
Man: I’m straight 
James: so is spaghetti til you get it wet and hot 😈😈
man the part where james adresses his mom gotta be the best part of this video lmfao
10:13
When James was born his parents tried to change his gender
when the master speaks.

If you want James to speak faster, speed up the video by x1.5 or doubled
Normally I can't understand James because he talks so fast I think he put this video in 0.25x speed

Everyone who disliked this video still meat rides James Charles
Pewdiepie: I can’t be too harsh on him

James: But I’ve always tried...

Pewdiepie: 
I think James Charles watched this video and followed pewd's advice.
Apology accepted!!!  Oopsie Hahaha, you're really good at this Felix!! 👐 😂 😂
He probably put the video so long to try and get ad revenue.
YouTube: Who is Pewds gonna do next

Pewds: idk 


Tseries: Allow me to introduce myself
Well YouTube rewind 2019 is gonna be an adventure isn’t it?
I watched the whole James Charles video but tbh I spaced out at some point and when I came back to reality it was the ending
just getting in to the tea thanks for keeping me up to date my dayyd
I almost clicked off the video because how quiet his apologie video was.
Lmaooooo did anyone notice 😂 what he did with tati's name ! I'm dead 💀
Tuber simulator should come with a new feature


Apology videos
Omg, why people watch this boaring dissent YouTuber
i didn't even get 3 minutes into the video before I clicked off, or I probably would've fallen asleep

James Charles: crying
Pewdiepie: laughing
Thanos: perfect balance
Pewdz  literally made the perfect apology for JC in 30 secs
pewdiepie... everyone sleeps with earrings on 🤣
I skipped the video (James’ video) because I thought it was boring as well and now I don’t understand what’s wrong...maybe because I saw Tati’s immediately
funniest part is that pewdiepie is 1000x more attractive than james charles
Guys go back to James' video. He has apologised as per pewds teaching 😂 He is a fast learner. Pewds will be proud of him.
my life wouldn't be the same without this channel <3
He is going for the 10 min vid
this was a great video but I got 5 ads! 5 ADS!

Apology : The Dos and Don'ts.
I LOVE that James Charles actually took Felix's advice. That's f*cking awesome. Btw, James Charles also did tweet a thank you about this
I honestly don't know what's happening, I'm just here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Well, well
A Pewdiepie video in the Hungarian trending page
Interesting
But James Charles' respond is 6th in the trending here lmao
James should be thankful that you did this video
Me gustó mucho tu vídeo pwiediepie (soy mexicano)
Tati’s video felt shorter than James apology video
The way James voice sounds I want him to say the word pottery. Phhhottery
nobody:

James Charles: sighs  u👄u
The whole James's vid looks like he's about to yawn
I'm clueless what is going on?
when pewdiepie made a better apology for james then james did
I sleep with my earring on 😢
when you apologize, don't make a "i just woke up and i'm sorry, i will try to learn and grow"-video, that obviously never works, do a professional video where you explain what really happened and WHY you are sorry. this video made it worse, these vids always do, they make it seem like the person apologizing just confirms everything. if he would have done the second video first, he would not have lost those subs.
Notice how James' lips never touch when hes speaking.
but honestly, i like all your responses about this "war", roftl
James charles starts an apolygy video
PEWDIEPIE: Ah shit here we go again
what would you rate his new "apology"?
If youre making an apology video, MAKE IT 10 MINS SHORTER, i dont have time to view 40mins apology vid.
10:18 "why are you addressing your mum?" LMAO HAHA
I’m not supposed to give my own opinion 
But Felix did a better apology in 40 secs than James
Looks like pewd about to fall asleep while watching James
you should react to Minh Béo apology clip
Pause on 0:16 tatti definition I died XD
I just want to beat him with a rod looking and listening to him JUST TALK! DONT ACT LIKE YOU JUST WOKE UP
Tuber simulator should come with a new feature





Apology videos!
"She clearly didn't do a good job uhhh😬😬😬" 😂💀
I sleep with five (small hoop) earrings on every night!
Honestly lets give James some credit for watching this video and taking Felix’s advise. 
His new video actually follows pretty much all Felix’s suggestions and because of that he got his name cleared.
Sorry that I am so uncultured, but what even happened. 🤷‍♂️
James Charles: Makes apology video

PewDiePie: laughs in Swedish
WAIT, did you say SHE or HE? Xd
James video felt longer than Tati's
Thank you for your lessons, sensei.
He clearly feels no remorse cuz he is smiling the whole time
50% Breathing
50% Talking

Let the reader get = 1OOO $
Licked = good luck!

Apology 👏🏻 Review 👏🏻
I cant believe this guy is still around....
He makes a good point, if you just go and flat-out apologize it makes you look guilty as hell and that's exactly what I thought especially since he acknowledged that tati mentioned the boys
I don’t know why but I love when he says “ tea time YAY tea time”😂😂
which apology is better. Logan, Leech, or James?😂
Can we have an apology video tutorial ?
I like how he still says "subscribe if you haven't" as if everyone hasnt already subscribed to him.😂😂
i felt like James seemed really genuine by pointing out he had plenty of mistakes to make in the future, particularly before stating he was gonna do his best to improve. If it had been the other way around, it would've come across as defensive and self servicing, whereas making it it clear primarily that he's aware of his own faults presented it as more honest
I feel like felix is focused on more persuasion, and convincing people to one side rather than another. James seems like he's just getting something off his chest and saying what's on his heart
I'll agree with felix that it was weird that he brought up his mom tho lmao
He actually doesnt' pause the video , he just speaks in the breathing gaps.
I thought at first that he was going to facetime James
This should be titled: How to Make a Good Apology Video
A that's a pin not an earing 
B I have one in my ear too and I literally never take it out wtf who takes out earnings that aren't dangly when they sleep 
C this beef is stupid and the real tea should be the many many other garbage things James does and how no one had a problem with any of it until James promoted a brand tati didnt own
Everyone always says don't trust people with two first names
Logan Paul: no one can fall harder than me
James Charles: hold my foundation
even on 2x speed this apology takes forever
11:46 I never thought someone would say that he talks slow😂
Roses are red 
James is bae
If you don’t like this comment 
Then James is your bae
3 ads man you are booming
Jake Paul: furious note taking
Not related but, I do actually sleep with my earrings on
James should have been shoved in lockers more back in HS
Bahahahaha. That "guy" is supposed to be a "guy"? 😭😂😭😂😭😂
I look forward to PewdiePie’s PR Empire
4:35
Pewdiepie: cant really be too harsh on him
James: ...but i've always tried
Pewdiepie: WELL TRY HARDER
Imagine looking up to James Charles as a role model....
12:00 yup even i doubt it ..infact i couldn't watch your entire video too..It's so boring (coz of james Charles)
Who even is James Charles and what is the beef? 
I've noticed it being all over youtube, but haven't caught on as to what actually happened
This video has ads. ADVERTS. DUDE
Professor. Pewdiepie

PHD, in internet Apology Videos
Felix is the best backseat apologizer
Play Life is strange 2 please
this face is something i can kick and punch all day long
Felix is the new priest of YouTube

Come to Felix to cleanse your sins
Nobody:

James Charles: How to speak for 8 minutes yet say nothing
From this apology video I have no idea what he did. Felix managed to make it more interesting at least
Yo who subscribe for the memes
if you watch James`s video in 2x the speed, you understand what he says and waist just 7 minutes of your life!
He always talks extremely slow it's why I cant watch his videos without fast forward
James Charles apology video:

98% Breathing 
1% actually talking and cringe
1% he says ummmmm
Does anyone know the distorted lofi piano song playing around 10:00?
Sometimes I just imagine myself being best friends with Felix and giving me good advices for everything
Why I keep repeating this 8:50

" Then tell us"
Me: you can watch in VR 😱
takes off makeup 

Has to clarify who he is 

"It's James here"
never heard james talk so slow oof
When Felix takes his headset off 🤤😻😻😻😻😻 omg your hair
Is it just me or has james charles just drew on the spots on his face???????
Like with sharpie or something
James apology seems longer than tati’s 40 minute one
0:13
Jaques charleston 😂
I watched that video with 1.5 speed :-))))
I LOVE THE INTRO HAHHAA
im pretty sure he took pewdiepies advice in his comeback vid.
James got himself a 10% off on his subs with the code James.
if this kid slowly exhales again I will cry
James is a very confused man.
React to the new one!
13:36 feels like if a movie is gonna be made about James this is the clip that would be shown in it
James charles: straight men are gays
Jk rowling: Finally some worthy competition
was it just me or did you just look at that dried up drool on the left side of James mouth? because it bugged me. a lot.
RIP poods. Now I have to go sub to T-series our new overlords
James was going so slow that even an ad appeared in the middle of the video
Omg we’re going to America what if I get diabetes 😂
james:ive been really trying :/


pewdiepie: THEN TRY HARDER
omg pewdiepie is so funny idk why I hadn't subscribed earlier!
This video isnt copyrighted??
7 minute taste like an hour. lol
coming to this after watching James Charles' "no more lies" video is mega uncomfortable
I think what really happens is James spoiled end game to Tati
Please rate Gus Johnson's apology video
When you see Logan Paul's so sorry and think it's a diss track
I watch james’ apology video before bed to fall asleep
James charles lost 3 mil subs and got 3 mil dislikes.
Coincidence i think not!
Anyone:
Makes an apology video

PewDiePie:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
WHAT A FUCKIN Nice person 
Your a nice person Felix
Out of 10 I will give 1
I can’t this has made me hate James more
WTF does James keep doing with his bottom lip its pissing me off and idk why
You know it’s bad when reasonable pewdiepie comes out.
..
How most people call James Charles: James Charles
How I call James Charles: 0:14
Well you were right about a lot, Felix, but you were wrong about one thing; James definitely handled the receipts situation adeptly.
10:49 The reason he brought her up is because she was clapping back and arguing with people on social media about him. Effectively making the situation worse and more heinous. Some people even went so far as to accuse him of sending her after people. I think he was trying to make it clear that he does not approve of her doing it
Dude pewds sounds like an english professor omg this is so LIT
James Charles: "In my defence some people just dont know they're gay yet"
J.K Rowling: "I know right!"
I don't know 'bout you but I'm enjoying Pew stressing out on James' vid.
True friend stab you in the front
I watched this video in x2 speed because I though that James talked way too slowly
I cant watch this. He is so fake(JC)...
He protecc 
He attacc 
but most importantly 

Straight men don’t like him bacc
Dude makes my skin crawl.
Disingenuous in the extreme
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT TO DO THIS FOR CRINGE TUESDAYS?!
logan paul: I'm the most hated youthuber
James Charles: Hold my DilDo
You and Papa Timmy would be the best of friends
Nobody:

James Charles' sub count: Its Rewind Time Everybody!
Let’s see how many dislikes I get 

I’m not subscribed
Actually so true I didn’t watch the whole thing bc he was talking so freaking slow I just couldn’t take it 😂😂
He's 19. he's just being himself. give him another chance.
james apologizing and saying im gonna make more mistakes
Ok, but PewDiePie seems like a legit apology critic. He points out all the flaws, and actually offers solutions to them.
I give it a broken marriage out of 10
You should do a parody on his apology video 😂
Nobody:
James Charles: UM
i actually watched James' whole video, buh tbh it took me like 3 hours... by being bored an having to keep going back after breaks an stuff
James charles: cries 
Pewdiepie: laughs
me: PERFECTLY BALANCED AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE.
I thought this was a video on ricegum
not gonna even lie but i would've given him a - 2
i never noticed his mustache line before
what the fffffff... his facial impressions (and the 'in a bad way ASMR' voice) literally give me creeps... I admire Pewds for going through this video
The way Felix has managed to get apology videos down to an art form is inspiring
ive already been playing tuber simulator and spent money on it (place winking pewdiepie pointing at you here)
James looks like he’s going to throw up throughout the whole video...
If he cut out the gaps it would be 3 minutes
This drama is the most popular, confusing and boring.
Pewds just made this video twice as long as James 's video
I love how he’s never involved in drama
1:17 makes me laugh but why is Felix also adorable??!? He’s so precious here :))
its a girl or a guy? my reaction after seeing and hearing him
I love it when the king of youtube makes fun of his subordinates
I rate it a broken friendship out of 10
2:23 People do sleep with earrings in their ears. Especially if they are small. That is not odd. No one has ever accused James Charles of talking slow. He usually talks like he's missed his Adderall for the week! James Charles has too much to lose. He shoulda hired a PR agent to make sure he said the right things. 
Bottom Line: White people problems! Tati turned this entire situation into something bigger than it needed to be with her tear soaked videos. I thought someone died the way she was carrying on. Nope. Her feelings were hurt. Awww...
She's talking about James Charles needed to grow up, SHE needs to grow up! She needed to pull JC to the side behind the scenes. Get him to make new promo vids for her products and keep the gravy train moving. But she couldn't do that bc her feelwings gots hurt.
this video has been going on for 12 minutes and it's so cringey how slow he talks
Lmao love you, Pewds!😂❤️
Pewds should get a side job writing other people's apology videos
Please react to James New video!!
We need an apology rewind
I didn't expect this video to be very serious but holy shit this is some proper solid advice that I will be writing down for future reference
Some. Of. Y’all. Are. Finna. Be. Real mad at me. But. It must be said.
James Charles to straight men: you are actually gay 

Jk Rowling: a worthy contender has risen...
But I sleep with all my earrings in....
Luba é o PewdiePie versão Br🇧🇷🇧🇷
i dont understand any of the drama i need an explanation please!!! from the start to end
Pewds is the wonderful guardian angel of YouTube
Apology Video kit: 
1. No makeup 
2. Non-existent Tears 
3. Don't even talk or say anything about the drama and what's wrong in the video 
4. Small caps in the title
Felix is just a social media expert now
I would love to see a video of Felix explaining all of his tattoos
Those 9k dislikes are from the ppl that unsubscribed from James Charles channel. 
When they saw his face in the thumbnail...all hell broke loose
Hey now, I sleep with earrings in, don’t come for me like that.
Tuber simulator should come with a new feature

Apology videos
James Charles should do a diss track
Felix your reviews are outstanding. Youve helped a lot of people
james charles likes to sugarcoat what he says.. to pewdiepie the truth matters
I watches this video x 2 so I didn't wasted time
Nobody:
James Charles: Heavy breathing
people will watch this before making an apology video lol
sorry had this on 1.5 speed XD
Pewds started as a Gamer and now he's giving tips! He can do anything! 🤘
Meme review? Get ready for APOLOGY REVIEW
Felix needs skillshare to sponsor him for an apology video class
Papa Gloria you should be a jury in their court case
Just sounds like James wants us to feel bad for him...
listen to him always not kidding not every person is perfect😒😡
James just sounded like he was out of breath the whole time..
Pewds. Saving me from having to watch any of their crap myself. A true hero❤️
Randomly bring up his mom lol.....why tho
Normally you sleep with earings on
Now I realised how educational this video is.
Idk much of this drama but I think people need to cut this boy some slack 🤷‍♀️ seems like small mistakes that anyone would make and he's making his effort, so what's so bad about this?
I want Pewdiepie to be my English teacher
Dang I feel so bad for James’s brother, he’s probably getting bullied like crazy rn
i watched tati’s 43 minute bye sister video easily but i struggled to watch his awful 8 minute apology video🙄
Is he actually in need of those glasses or is he just another glassgirl
2:17 hey Pew you're handsome *acts skiddish.
Old pewdiepie: why do I keep getting involved in drama

2019 pewdiepie: let's just jump Right in to it
Those 8.6 dislikes are probably James Charles’ loyal 12-year-olds fans
the thing that happened at chapotle is e-coli not ebola 🤦🏻‍♀️🥶
i dont get what happened with james charles wanna help me
I got a Mr Beast ad on this video
James Charles: "omg my career is over, I'm loosing so many subs, I'm the most hated person on youtube!"

Pewdiepie: "first time?"
YaY, daily dose of drama.
I think this scandal is just for money. Negative stuff always brought viewers and attention. Good marketing for them with bad morality
... I sleep with earrings on
Everyone: you can’t make people gay 

James Charles: Hold my hairspray
James Charles: Hi...

Me: Goes to shop, travels to Africa and back, eats lunch, walks dog, has 4 hour nap, wakes up

James Charles: ... all.
Laughing so hard in the midnight 😂
I didn' t even watch his video I literally spent about 20 minutes reading the comments and laughing lmfao 
It DoEsN't MaTtEr BeCaUsE i'M fAmOuS like lord help me
0 broken carrier out of 10
James' 9 minute apology video - 0/10


Pewds 30 second fake apology for correcting James' apology - 11/10
I didn't watch the entire 8 minute james Charles video cause it was so DARN slow. But I watched a video twice as long breaking all of it down to pieces😂 hail pewdiepie
Why da fack does he keep biting his lip 😂😂😂😂
i'm taking notes.......... in case i need to apologize to konoha when naruto or kakashi isnt around
I sleep with earings😂😂
James Charles: "I Owe Everybody An Explanation."


Proceeds To Not Give Everybody An Explanation
Wondering how different James' new vid would look like without Felix 😂😂😂
6:28, The almost smile that Pewds mentioned is called Duper's Delight. It's when someone is trying to manipulate someone and they are happy because they think that they can get away with it. 
Thank you Pewds for calling BS to his apology!
Look how uneven his eyebrows are (James Charles')
"she clearly didnt do a good job" haha legend
Anyone:
Makes an apology video

PewDiePie:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
Lmfao 😂😂
The thing is he said that he was sorry for hurting them not doin whatever shit he did with vitamins
congrats felix you singlehandedly convinced james to make his new video and uncancel himself
every youtube apology video starts with the youtuber being like
whooosshhhhhhh!!!
“The truth doesn’t matter”
-James Charles 2019
U look good in this video...😋
If I'm being honest I couldn't sit through the whole thing, you make it much more bearable.
Honestly felix is that youtuber who sheds light onto a situation and blesses us with his wisdom and opinion
This entire apology video is a worthy cringe Tuesday content.
James's apology was so long that Kanye West finished his presidential term
Last 3 videos about James Charles
he addressed his mom because his mother was dragged for liking tweets ..that's why he publicly told her to stop so she doesn't receive more hate 

and both his and tati's videos were soo  confusing...I had the same experience as well
Tea time! Yay tea time! 🤣
12:20 "end the video james" hahahahaa
pewdiepie is actually an intellectual and provided james with a lot of constructive  criticism. While still having his humor and not boring us.
Much respect
“when wILL YA LEARN”
You are the champion. Epic how-to video.
In this apology I’m gonna sigh more than talk
Subscribe to PAANMAN
He actually doesn't pause the videos he just speaks in the breathing gaps
James Charles kissed you...

How can u compare loghan with james?
0:17 Pause quickly 😂
I am 1 year younger than Minecraft
Nobody:

James Charles: I’m about to end my whole career
Well "TRY HARDER" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
90% Breathing
10% Talking
400% Pewds Correction of Apology Video
"500%"
I watched one vid of you this morning and you had 98M but now , night time, you have 95M? Owww
watched this after watching James' uno reverse card. and realised James talked to pewds?😂
Jame Charles: "In my defense some people just don't know they're gay yet"
J.K Rowling: "I know right"
3:15 “Everything she said”
What is your name because am new
most random thought: I just realised how much pewds reminds me of Chandler Bing from Friends lol
Next up: ProJared Apology video!
felix exposed us. nobody watched james’ whole video lmao
Why gotta be so fine?
I dont know if its just me but James Charles looks like  he hasnt brushed his teeth in this video.
When you have no idea who he is, you despise the fact that people are masses yet another time and watching TV shit on youtube... but you still watch cause maybe there are other things than just this topic.
what he says??
Anyone:
*Makes an apology video*

PewDiePie:
The way Felix says Tati with his Swedish accent makes me laugh.
Help I always read Tati as the Punjabi word Tatti
Tbh Felix’s James Charles apology is better then the real one
Pewds: Gives advice on how to create an argumentative, persuasive speech.
James: Fails.
Pewds: COME TO ME.
James: breathing heavily for 8 min








Oxygen: 
can we please just make it out of this cursed decade alive? PLEASE, CAN WE??
James: cri
Pewds: eh-hehe
But... But.... I sleep with my earrings on... XD
he talks either too fast or too slow
Tati 40 minutes to destroy your career. 


James I can do it in 8 betch.
Why does he close his eyes while talking? Looks rly weird
is pewdiepie actually dr phil?
6:45 pewds: so stupid
James: i’m sorry. 

😂😂 the timing is perfect.
Mom in case you're reading this:

I forgot my lunch at home can you please bring it to school?
some one started a kick-starter that has 200 supporters to send James charges a lot about more than 900 tissues
Pewds just single-handedly saved James's career
Pewdiepie: “Tati is clearly way smarter than James...There’s no way even if you had the facts that he would be able to pull that off.”

James: hold my tea
When pewdiepie says, at least you should give context then doesnt give any context himself lol, i still dont know what happened.
Thanos: Snaps

James Charles: It didn’t do anything

Thanos: Look at your subscriber count
I smashed LIKE this time Pewdiepie. I've been watching your videos for a long time and I always forget to smash like because I'm just here for the vids and not the clicking. I hope this doesn't make you sad.
his video is literally most of it breathing and apologising but not explaining like, when you watched the video you don't know anything more about the situation than before it hahahah :')
We don't know what happened tell us James.... Tell usss
use x1.5 speed for a better experience
James: “be my boyfriend”
Person: “I’m not gay”
James: “did I ask?”
thats the man i fell in love with
I think people are disliking the vid cuz of James
No one: 
James Charles: umm
Omg who is this guy jamescharles
When Logan Paul’s apology was more sincere then James Charles.
Why is sleeping with earrings on suspicious? A lot of people sleep with earrings on...
He kinda looks like Eliot Rodger
omg that is pure cringe
You posted this on my birthday 😱
Honestly, James apology video felt longer than tati's 43 min video
Normally pewds videos doesn’t feel that long but watching the part where James Charles’ video makes it all longer
Now all makeup comunity coming to pewdiepie. 👌
It's gonna be good.. 👐
P.D. Pie Apology Consulting Services LLC
YAY!!!
Apologies aren't hard if you actually apologize. Two simple steps:
1. Own up to your mistakes
2. Actually be sorry for them
After JC's No More Lies video yesterday, it is safe to say that James Charles is smarter than Tateen. He followed Felix advice to a T... 😂😂😂😂
Lol "sorry I know this isn't a laughing moment" (but I cant help but laugh) - apology king
Pewds should be the new Dr. Phil
Never fell asleep this fast before
most subscribed youtuber giving tips how to apologize to the youth.
what a legend
Holy crap clicked away cause he is so gaaaaaaayyyyy
loses 1 million
James Charles: sniffs
loses 2 million
YouTube Rewind 2018: Ah that’s hot

YouTube Rewind 2019: OOPSIE
Who did a Tatti Fam?
... do people not use the playback speed for slow videos like apologies?
Who else hasn’t even watched James’s original Apology video?
He came back from it 😂
The critique skills of a university english professor
Jeez thats not an apology video, its just begging for a pity video
I think he ment Tati as his mom
James Charles: what should I say for my apology video?

Fake breathing: yes
Funny how y'all are suddenly agreeing with Pewds when I clearly remember not that long ago (yesterday) most of the comments saying he wasn't understanding Tatis video. Gloria Poppins doesn't deserve this behavior 😤
Why does he remind me about my brother
I just can’t understand why people tell the world about their drama/issues, really can’t  understand that.
Egoistic sonofafaggot
James Charles to straight people: You are gay



JK Rowling: A worthy contender has risen
Damn he truly is dumb as a rock. Watching this hurt.
4:41 when you tried your best but you don't succeed
I am feeling personally attacked about sleeping with my earrings on.
Pewdiepie/Brad needs to make an apology video for his audio being out of sync
Rules in Apology Vids:
1. Start video by turning on camera.
2.  End video crying
Why do you get into stuff that has nothing to do with you
Hire Felix as your PR person during controversy
I know this is a serious vid but all the zoom in/zoom out cuts are a bit obnoxious
Felix coming in hot with actual constructive criticism; a rare thing in this day and age.
FIRST VIDEO PEWDIEPIE NEVER SWORE ON 2019
This whole drama made me subscribe to james, before this I didn’t like him but he actually really shines through in his new video !!
thank god i didnt watch the video because i wouldve skipped every 2 seconds
TF did I watched in 1:08. I LOST IT Lol.
James charles is trying to kiss you.. 



Like to YEET him out of the window.
I still play tuber stimulator.
I sleep with earing 😓
Casually waiting for him to publish a book on the etiquettes for apology videos.
This was the most I’ve scene of James apology video 
At least pewds adds a commentary factor that makes it bearable 

lol not even gonna edit out the mistake BITCHES 😂
It’s ok guys he’s a celebrity
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN!!!!!! WHEN WILL YOU LEARN, THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg why did I laugh so hard 😂
Who think that T-series will back from today by in 2030
Send James to the ranch😂😂😂 

(Phone) 
Felix:  I have a good story for you. 
Dr. Phil:  APPROVED
Почему субтитры исчезают (((
WELL TRY HARDER😂😂😂🤣
I mean, James was a bit rude, but he kinda did not deserve it. But I I kinda think it was good that he canceled everything.
You the onlyone that right in this situation
"it's almost like he's admiting defeat" 

actually laughed at this so hard
Comments doing a 180 on their opinion of this video
“When will ya learn!” hahahaha @1:05
just watching your beautiful eyes
Y'all get what he's doing right? Pewds got his hands on a physiology book. He's using YouTube and the "segregation" together. (I might not word this right and it might not make sense to everyone, but I'll do my best)
What he is doing is he's taking this guy/whatever wants to be called and giving out facts by using the drama.
Not saying that he lives off drama. He just gets his love by trying to further "being a good person" (by my opinion) by intellectually giving out facts for all sides (Even though he laughs at some stuff, doesn't men he doesn't care or want other people not to). 
I respect him for that.

Edited: "James had nothing to apologize for."

Edited; Edited: "Well.... Depends on facts?"

Edited; Edited; Edit: Pewds: "Well... TRY HARDER!!!"
Pewdiepie - father of apologies, breaker of the insincere apology trend, and rightful heir to the youtube throne.
I think they are both posers.I feel they conspired to do it?
This apology video was so lengthy and boring I had to watch it at x2.0 speed.
This is what happens when there is no father in the home lol
I couldn’t watch the whole thing. So cringe
James: You are a great mother 


Felix: She clearly didn’t do a great job
...
James voice ---i can smell it hEhh
Came here to detox from the GoT finale
I can't actually believe that James Charles said Pewdiepie's Advice 14:11 in his "No More Lies" Video
Him talking slow made me so mad lmfao
Tati: bye sister!
James: sorry Tati
Ppl: Tea! Tea!
PewDiePie: lemme rate the drama
This apology is more cringey than me wth
hahahahha, I cant even finish James video, but I watch the whole from pewdiepie
Very well done t series
CrIGnGE  and booooooring
James to hit 100 mil first
Lmao I love how Pewd's call's people out on there bs
He starts laughing lmao.
heerz da mothafukin te
heerz da mothafukin te
99% trying not to sneeze
1% talking slowly

Oof
felix is actually helping him omg
i love u man , ureally nailed it
James Charles is not sorry hes just your typical FAKE
i sleep with my earrings in
40% breathing 
40% licking his lips
20% talking
Couldn’t make it through the video cause his apology was so bad. Had to watch in 2 parts
Damn when he talks about Tati he looks FURIOUS
James actually took the advice on the new vid
Pause ;00:17 ;u will love this
Tati’s 48 minute video was way easier to watch than James’ 8 minute video
Pewdiepie literally wrote the perfect apology for James to use from 14:16-14:52, while James had an 8 minute long video with no apology whatsoever.
This man needs to write his second book.
12:00: THAT'S WHY IM HERE
Why do people dislike, like I dont get it
My favorite part was when he mentions his mom and tried to cry but can’t produce a single tear
James pause before he said "...............I hurt her" kinda got me thinking thats hes not and that he just was trying to get people back on his side but was incredibly reluctant to admit that it was he who hurt her. Whatever tho cause im probably wrong and just weird for seeing that lol :)
I didn't even know what happened there
Pewdiepie: Tati shouldn’t have dragged James
Also Pewdiepie: *drags James
James charles is the reason i wanna die
pewdiepie is actually an intellectual and provided james with a lot of constructive  criticism. While still having his humor and not boring us.
Much respect
James Charles is really hard to look
10/10
TATIS video is now deleted😂
what about justin biebers apology video?
James Charles: Crying
PewDiePie: Laughing
Tati:This is just amazing

Edit:Thanks For The Likes! 🙏
I really though it was a girl who was talking in the apology
This guy is a total fruit.
im sorry but wtf is wrong with him lmao
bruh his example apology for james was like lawyer level haha james should take notes
For real, if Pewds didnt make it big with Youtube, he would have been an amazing communications/PR professional.
I just liked this video because of pewdiepie but i didn't watch the whole video because of the cringe face of james lmao
This isn’t Tuesday... haven’t cringed this much EVER... buh!
Pewdiepie ja my favorite Drama Channel 😂
50% Breathing
30% Laying
20% Talking
deadass took me 4 days to finish james’ apology video
2:50 lmao 😂
The expert of apology videos is talking
6:19 😂 so true
Waiting until shane dawson does a documentary on him.
i sleep with earrings :x
Hey Felix I need an apology video where do I contact you? This is URGENT.
no one looks up to him as a role model
I sleep with earrings on
Youtuber:Makes an apology

Pewdiepie:Joins as spectator
i didn't watch james's wholel apology vid 'cause there's too much breathing and pauses lol
Thank you Pewdiepie we lost👊👊👊🙏🙏
I sleep with earrings on
2:07 in the apology video he forgets what to say and looks at the script
“But I’ve always tried-“ 
 “ WELL TRY HARDER! “



😂😂😂
He. 
Talks.
Waaaaay.
Too.
Slow.
Pewds.
How can you stand thaaat
U could look up to Felix so much 😂😂
I sleep with earrings on
Can someone explain what he did?
when pewdie's suggested apology at 14:02 is better than James' own apology
I didn't I came and watched your video instead, thanks pewds
If you keep disappointing people, how is that exactly growing/improving?
Don't know who this guy is or Tati
He apologised to Tati?? And his mum? He barely even hurt them wtf
James Charles: Makes an apology video
Pewds: This does put a smile on my face
He still gay
Sammy for meme review
0:17 finally he mentioned that in the video
The best parts are 2:50 and 10:20
James took pewds advice 😂🥳 and brought up recipients and now everything makes sense wow look what listening to pewds can do
WELL TRY HARDER
Not sure why ppl are using the fact that he's wearing earrings as proof he didn't just wake up (the styled hair maybe😒). Lots of ppl sleep with their earrings in...heck i used to sleep with 8 and a necklace 😩
I really want to sneeze for him
How come I can hear James Charles is this video but in his video I couldn't hear nothing😐
james: BuT i HaVe AlWaYs TrIeD *EXHALES ANNOYINGLY*

PewDiePie: WELL TRY HARDER

Pewds, saying what we're all thinking. A true king.
road to 100m!!!
11:56 mr beast
I caNT LAUGH AND IT HURTS
Daughter 1: I’m lesbian 
Father: okay
Daughter 2: I’m lesbian too
Father: does anyone in this house like men?!?
Son: I do
Fun fact of the day: Minecraft is 10 years old today!
Your trending finally 👊
James was trying really hard to hold back that sneeze
1:03 Ouch, don't say that or he might come to you, Pewds.


ProJared peeking out
Hahaha do you know meaning of tatti in india
Watching this apology video was just like watching paint dry.
woa felix sensei :3
i don't even follow james charles.i've watched couple of tati's vids but i stopped because i guess just happened that the ones that i've watched,the products that she reviewed on are just too expensive.so can't relate.BUT..i gotta watch this.because i wanna know what pewds gotta say about this
I can't even look at that thing.
I’m not using my own account so ya but I wear earring in my sleep I don’t think I’m normal lol
Nobody:

Nobody at all:

 
Almost everyone sleeps with earings
Go rate his recent vid.
James Charles subscriber decrease: i am speed
The reason he brought up his mom is because in tatis video she brought up his mom first, saying she needs to do a better job of parenting her son.
when he spends more time talking about his mom then the straight boy situation
“GodDAMMIT he speaks slowly” -pewdiepie, about james charles. The first person to ever speak those words about james  in history.
Love that there was a make-up ad at the end of this video. 😂
You crack me up hahaha
I watched Tati’s 43 minute video, but couldn’t even watch 3 minutes of James’ apology video.
haha i know tati means poo in punjabi (one of indian language )
And you all thought Marzia stuck around for the money

2019: Over 4 m people watching a grown man talking about his balls
2017 pewds: "Ive run out of ideas"


2019 pewds: "i showed my balls to my dad"
*takes off pants right as doctor comes in*





I’m ready doctor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Pew during all the video "why am I sharing this?"

BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY AM I LISTENING TO SOMEON TALKING 'BOUT HIS BALLS FOR 11 MINUTES"
You froze so hard I thought my internet stopped working
You need a podcast I’d love to hear more of your stories
Thanos : "The world needs to be balanced"

PewDiePie : "My balls need to be balanced



Thanos did it of course
Nobody:
Felix:I'm going to tell you about the time I broke my balls
10:20 xD Brad/Sive, you‘re a f*cking genius...
James Charles *tati: career is ending

Pewdiepie: I broke my balls
I love how he is so open to us lmao
Nobody:

Not a single soul:

Pewdiepie: i bROkE mY baLLs
Nobody:
Me: great, from now on i'll be reading pokéballs as poke balls
But the real question is....






Did he get a bOnEr??
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly 
He broke ass and sacc
The perfect sequel doesn't exi-

Pewdiepie: Hold my legs
Pewdiepie next week:
i bRoke mY oVaRiEs
i dont think i ever seen some public figure tell story about his balls to the public and reach 4M views ..

This series of videos will eventually will explain why he has no lower half
That aside, I just found 4 diamonds in Minecraft!!!
Today was my principals birthday and somebody gave him pewdiepie merch😂

1990: I bet in 2019 people will be making videos about breaking their balls.

MY BALLS ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN YOURS!
MY BALLS CAN WALK RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR!
"Endgame is the most anticipated sequel"

Pewdiepie:
I love that in the beginning it seemed like he was improvising and making this story as a joke
but in the middle he lowkey slowly got more and more believable while explaining it and now I have mixed emotions on if I should feel bad or laugh 😂
He protec 

He attac

But most importantly he break front and bac

I like how you just have your dog on your lap, and now I'm going to imagine that you record every video with a dog on your lap
"Do you give them the courtesy of lifting up your schlong?"
Felix: my dad doesn't have any embarrassing stories about me

Also Felix:
Pewdiepie: Ahh! I just woke up, let me upload some videos on Youtube.
Result: this nonsense video
No one 
Nobody
People without balls: is this a personal attack
He protecc
He atacc
But most importantly
He got a huge ballsacc
So.... It never shrunk back down.??
Pewds: Doesn't want to show his balls to his dad.

Also Pewds: Talks about his balls publicly to millions of people.

Story time with Felix 

What’s the story ?

How I broke my balls
Lol im laughing way too much at this
9:00 "I think that anyone that have balls feel very privileged to have them"
If you or a loved one has broken their balls you may be entitled to “cOmPiNsAtIoN” 😏
How many times is Edgar sitting on Pewds lap and we don't even know.
And this is how my balls are slightly larger than normal 

Weird flex but ok
You know that the whole dlive currency and stuff is a scam?
I shat my pants while filming.
Should be next video in this confession series!
1 minute silence for the people without a dad
Pewdiepie: My balls are slightly larger than average

Weird flex but ok.
This is how you know he’s run out of ideas
Me: DAD
Dad:Where the FrICk r ur pants m8
Me:ur gai now and I’m James Charles now

"Hey, i'm ready docter."😂

I couldn't even walk for nearly three months.
I’m really loving this “I broke my...” series...
"Perfect child." He said. 
"No embarrassing stories"
I got an ad for a game called ball blast. 
Coincidence I think not
I just got the notification for this video like 2 hours ago 😂

Yep its gamer time
Smash the subscribe button guy's
Glad to hear someone went through the exact same thing as me, The same thing happened to me when I was 7, Needless to say I will never forget the experience. Most humiliating and painful experience that a man can endure. I had to go through a operation , they fucked up the first time so I had to go again and couldn't walk or move for weeks and my balls are still oddly different size.    Would not recommend to anyone.
-LordFroggit 2019
"Show you're balls to you're dad." Some peeps don't got balls and some people don't got dads. Some don't got both, but k. Still love this video 😂
We just listened to a guy tell a story about his 🏀 🏀
Pewds: What was the point of this video..?

Your fans: to make your fans happy.
Now this is a original content
This Is Awkward 7:17 The Ladies Looking and poking Your BALLS!!!

I know how humiliating it is. So I understand.😂😁👍
Pewdiepie's ball: I'm about to end this man's whole dignity
Had simillar expirence. Nice to hear i'm not alone with that ;d
The quality looks amazing for once
These are my favorite storytimes on youtube.
Quality 👏 content 👏
No one:

Pewdiepie: 
 I HAVE BIGGER BALLS THAN AVERAGE
Is it just me or is his accent getting EXTREMELY triggering
What's the kazoo song played at the start? xd
LUL that story intro "THATS NOTHING THATS NOOTHINGG" i can't wait for the rest of this
Someone make a 10 hour version of 6:13 lmao

Pq tá em português o título?? WTF
I wonder what went through your mind for you to decide to share this story
I’m enjoying this “I Broke my....” series 

Vary nace 👍
I watched this bare high I the room was spinning
Is that a Video Girl Ai shirt? Damn that's a real old underground anime.
This is my favorite video on youtube
We surely take our balls for granted.
Who else checked their balls after this video? XD
James : career ending



PewDiePie : i broke my balls
That's why I love ur channel who is with me
Who else just checked there inbox to see he just made a vid
Very nice to know you have ball's Babe 😍 Thank you so much for being here for me, I love you Babe very much 💘
I had testicular torsion. similarly terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through this
James: career ending

PewDiePie: I broke my balls
Next thing you see: I broke a world record
He has solved our school system 

5:57
Bruh if I had the same problem I'd rather stay that way rather than showing my father
Who else thought that the video was suddenly paused at 6:20?
This is unironically my new favorite series.

Same exact thing happened to me, It was on my 19th birthday when I had to go get them checked for the same reason, and that "scan thing" they did was an ultrasound, so in conclusion we're basically brothers, although I'm still curious, right or left?
I actually broke my balls, literally, having to get stitches, this is true
Pewdiepie: "realised the camera is not focused"

Me: It was never focused
No you always lift your own schlong I'd think
YOU SHALL BREAK YOUR HAND NEXT CAUSE THAT MAKES SENCE OR ANOTHER SENSIBLE THING IS TO BREAK YO HAIR YASSS

Calm down bro! Calm down take a deep breath, world is not as bad as you think :p
Welcome to the "i broke my" series,where Felix talks about stories where he broke his body parts,we are currently on episode 2 with more episodes and suffering to come.
Roses are red, shout-
outs aren't cool, you just 
lost a follower or maybe 
even two. Nobody likes 
them, nobody cares, you 
never shout us out, it 
isn't fair. You do it for the 
money, you do it for the 
fame, just cut it out, it's 
really lame. It should be 
stopped, it should be 
banned. So there could 
be peace here on 
Youtube. Ask me to send this to you and post this on every shout-out you see to stop this 
shout-out legacy.

You must have a lot of balls for telling this story
Weird flex but okayy..
uuuummm
 my dad is dead what am i suppose to do now??
PewDiePie: "very embarassing experience"
Also PewDiePie: tells story to millions of people
it looks like theres a pug on your lap. is there?
A couple months ago my left ball was slightly bigger than my right ball.

No big deal, the thing is, when I got a boner or had to go 'drain the lizard,' the left ball shrinked and the right ball grew.

In 6:30 who thought that this video is paused??????
I'm so with you on this, the exact same thing happened to me (it's called a varicocele, I'm guessing it's what you have too)


Basically, I'm going to see my doctor. He's nonchalantly squeezing da ballz, then sends me to take an echography... Hell if I still remember the small talk during the echography, with a dude massaging your balls and talking about the weather at the same time, showing you on screen "See this, that's ur ball from the inside lol", etc...


Long story short, when I went back to my doctor and asked if I had to go under surgery or something, he said "Nah, don't worry, you still have another one"
The worst of all is: for some reason, I'm keeping a good memory of all this. It was funny after all
Your going go brake your leg or arm
ffffffffffff
ive been there brother
Next up, on the Pewdiepie channel:

"I HAVE A VEGANA"

Сколько раз прозвучало слово balls в этом видео?
Media: pewdiepie got his balls checked just so a female doctor could look at them!!!
Brofist dude you beat t series
PewDiePie was into Cock and ball torture before it was cool.
he is holding a detonator in his hand. this is why there are all those wires behind him
なんでよりによってこの動画に日本語字幕付けたんだよ…




最高じゃないか！
This is just an 11 minute flex on how Felix has large balls. I'm honestly glad I watched this.

Edit: My top youtube comment is about pewdiepies balls. Nice.
This makes me worry I don’t break mine

The Doctor was James Charles.
これが世界一か草生えたこれは登録案件や
This guy went from gaming to drama to meme reviews to his own news and finally to telling us stories about his broken body parts. 2019 Pewds
6:20 - 6:25 I thought my WiFi was lagging 🤣🤣🤣
Hah loser imagine having a dad
I had a similar experience with my boobs when I was like 9.
It was painful and hurts when touched told my mom then we went to the Dr where I lifted my shirt n he started pocking n said it was normal I'm just growing up. 
& that's the story of how my boobs are slightly larger than average.
James Charles career dropped down so straight he'd date it
He protecc,
He attacc,
But most importantly,
He has a larger than average ballsacc.
I thought cringe tuesday happen on tuesdays

Never in my life have I thought I’d listen to pewds tell such a story.
your ball reveals sound about as awkward as your handshakes
PEWDIEPIE SAVED MY LEFT TESTICLE!!

2 days ago I felt a continuous pain in my left testicle. I went to A&E which sent me to Hospital, which gave me an ultrasound on my sack (the jelly feels weird). The last 2 days have been weird and scary, but it was so calming to have heard through the experience of Pewds because I can agree, there is no perfect moment to first pull out your privates to a Doctor. After 5 of them I can say it gets easier after that first time. Turns out I also have an enlarged vain around Lefty and now have booked a surgery. I would have been 10 times as scared if not for this story so I raise a Brofist to you Sir, I may not have gone as soon as I did!

Help Pewdiepie realise he saved a mini Bro’s life!
Nobody:


Pewdipie:”My balls are slightly bigger than average”

It would have been even more humiliating if you got hard seeing that attractive doctor
You visit the doctor with your balls 4 times in your live and you think it's too much?
Girls have to visit the gynecologist twice a year at least. Like come on guys.
if felix ever makes a storytime with the lower half of his body, it means he would be the best storytime animator because his legs are cgi
Edgar sits on his lap out of shot when he records sometimes, and i think that's great

Then he brought in like 3 other doctors and they all surrounded my boob and did an ultrasound just to find out I had a cyst. Awful experience but I’m glad I went lol

Next episode: how I broke my liver by drinking to much after the ball in incident
Tseries are going fast sub make the new song
This video reminds me of when my son was close to four years old and I am standing in line at the bank; he keeps trying to get away.  Finally, the teller calls me up and I reach down to grab my son; then, I sat him on the shelf in front of the teller's station.  At that very moment he screams, "You broke my balls!"  I was shocked and embarrassed; looked around and the people's facial reactions didn't help any.  My son then, from both his pocks, pulls out the crushed ping pong balls and screams out, "See, you broke my balls!"  Everyone in all lines at the bank, including the teller, broke out in laughter; of course, I did too.  I miss my son so very much, he was funny and left lots of fond memories.  Unfortunately, my son died in a motorcycle accident thirteen years ago, his website for those who wish to know who this little boy was that screamed "You broke my balls!" 
He’ll break his eyeballs next

Me: Shows my balls to my dad


My uncle: Am I a joke to you?

Halfway through i got an ad for a product powder for balls
I once had this pretty frequent thing for multiple years where one or both of my testicles shot up into my body and it hurt like hell I went to my parents about it after like 2 years of this happening and my parents didn't know how long it had been going on (they still don't know) and they were freaked out and so I went to the doctor she had no clue, we went to a couple other doctors over the years and they still didn't know, years passed it stated happening so infrequently I didn't even care and then it stopped happening altogether, still have no clue wtf it was neither does my mom and my dad didn't know and then he passed away, it will forever remain the testicle mystery of the marine family

Friendship goals these two. Despite all the controversy. Felix absolutely shows his true self when Sean is around. Just two silly goofs having fun.
Seeing edgar again so much was the best part I missed him 😂😭
Grown ass men are trying to stay hip and relevant when they are dabbing and bottle flipping. 😂 Lol I love it

I like how he photoshopped legs onto himself
It's the luck of the Irish

that slap was the highlight of the video
Maybe the reason why the quality is so low in this video, is because brad had to do cgi for the legs. Thanks brad!

Where do I find the 50/50 thing
The editing is not good comparing to the first episode , disappointing ..
Felix vs Baldur interesting

And now: 2 things about morgz’s fortnite scene.
Presented by Emilio Ovalle 
1) the facecam takes up 25% of the screen so we can’t see any gameplay 
2) 7:36 “IT. FELLS. LIKE. IT. HAS. BEEN. AGES. SINCE. I. HAVE. BEEN. ON. FORTNITE”-Morgz


(sighs)
Why did I quote that
8:19 wait. Thats the last video where you and Jack bottleflipped
Why did you show it again?
We crash the car crashes she die we all die good explanation when the car stopped 12:23😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣
His dad should've paused the sperm before it came out.
Me: *goes in notifications and sees the thumbnail* 
Me: *blinks* I never subscribed Morgz
Me: *clicks notification and sees it's a Pewd's video* Wudaheck, mom, I didn't drink too much wine, did I?

This... this is why my father slapped me if I was ever stupid, and I'm thankful.

You didn’t watch til the end. Bald Martin won bc he never moved.
When I was riding a bus for boyscouts and the kid next to me his phone was at max volume it’s sounded like morgz fam
Pewdiepie: making fun of Morgz
The media: are you making fun of disabled people?
the iron wasn't even on.......... It would have been steaming and her hair wasn't even being straightened😂😂😂😂😂
I guess the volume button on the remote doesn't work.
Imagine that when he unpaused his mom she didn't get up
Nobody:
Morgz' Mum: /👁O👁\
What if instead of screaming ZA WARUDO, DIO does the Morgz “PAUUSEE”
The video made me uncomfortable every time they appeared on the screen.
Mom: criES

whoever disliked this loves morgz
This Morgz video is the

Cringe has mutated into something that seems human. And then had a family, and then of them became a YouTuber. Why. Just why.
I stopped playing fortnite after I found out people like this exist in the game.

Why is his mic the same quality as the one I used like 10 years ago 😂🙈
his channel needs to be banned for national security
The reason why he has to scream is because he doesn't know how to lower the volume of the music in the editing software
Y have I watched this more times than Morgz clickbaits
the hair, ''burned'' off.
who's gonna tell her
And I thought Ali A's intro was loud.
Damn i can watch Cardi B fine, but just, my ears were bleeding throughout this video
Morgz’s vids are faker than pornhub telling me that Jasmine lives 2 miles away from me
Pewdiepie was tagged in a dank meme on one of the Tuesdays and now, he's taking revenge!
That mom looks more like a porn actress than actual porn actresses lmaooo

Morgz:I'm gonna pause you
Me:sure about that
(Me ripping the controller out of morgz hand)
Me:wait a day and I'll unpause you which is when it ends😂
Hello amerıca this is turkey
Stupid random fact:
Cringe Tuesday is cringe Wednesday for Australians...
This reminds me of the floor is lava. 😍 Love you Babe
I thought that they didn't even press any button just hold the remote and scream PAAAAAUUUUUUSSEEEEEEE
this is just the premise for a hentai plot
I wounder how many people come to school with "MGZ" merch and get bullied for it 😂
Too much cringe. I literally can't finish this video.
Idk why he's mad  because he got  eliminated he had zero kills
People: America sucks
Morgan: HOLD MY BEER!
I almost disliked the video because of Morgz
His dad should have paused- and put on a condom.
The interactions with the mom reminds me of those fake mother-son porn.
Morgz would be the one to promote gambling to kids
No one:
Literally No one:
Morgz: ZA WARUDO
I can barley hold the camer- JUST A USE YOUR OTHER DAMN HAND LADY
Every time yOu AcTiVaTeD mY tRaP cArD
“PAUUUUUSEEEEE”
Morg unzips pants
sweet home Alabama plays in the background
I have the same remote...I don't feel proud
In the wise words of pauly d:
“ theres nothing like a nice herpe to ruin a party”
HOW DO YOU SAY THESE FUNNY THINGS WITHOUT LAFFING




Like if you agree
Lol if i was the mom being paused while driving i would have said:
"Stuff this"
Grabbed the remote and thrown out of the window
Pewdiepie: Makes fun of Morgz

Media: Pewdiepie makes fun of deaf people
When you pause at morgz face it looks like he's exploding 😂
9:13 ME AT THREE AM WITH THE CHEESE🤣😅😂 🧀
Morgz uses his mom
Morgz dad divorced his mum for a reason
I watched cringe Tuesday on Thursday...
.

Forgive me master
I like the part when he say
actually thought it was a morgs video






so its that bad
3:23 what a beautiful face to pause on
Pornhub music starts playing
6:38 all the orange juice containers WHY?
Felix: Hates when people include money in video
MrBeast: “am I a joke to you”
I love the seed deaths Jersey in the background LOL XD
that's irony since morgz should've been part of that seed death
Morgz walks into his parents bedroom while there bumping the uglys with a moisturizer 





PAUSE
Nobody: 
Morgz: 🍕
          👁🔅👁
             ⛩⛩
I feel like morgz may try to take the time stone and pause half the population in universe and finally pause thanos
This editing has really evolved. Glad my critique was put to good use ❤️
In the beginning i actually thought someone was calling me
wait is his gilfriend named kira? KILLER QUEEN BITES THE DUST
Kil the man for gods sake
I’m in cusdty for using a knife and I also think t series is dead and will shutdown..........






DONT ASK ME WHYYYY noiiiaaaaaaa
Pewdiepie: “ perfect example of YouTube these days, you can’t do anything without $10,000 on the line ”

Mr.Beast: Sweating Intensifies
When Morgz mom make that face she looks like a cheap blow up sexdoll
Thinks Morgz and his family are trying to be the next Team Ten or act like the Paul family impo. It has that vibe to it
I tried watching it
I cringed to much it was very rude I couldn't even watch 11 mins
Brent Rivera did a video before him  that was like this (But better) Morgz copied yet again We have enough proof to sue him
I like watching cringe Tuesdays cuz it reminds me what day of the week it is
Morgz making original content? Tf?
at 7:15 you can clearly see that she is intentionally inclining the juice box so  all the juice spills on the floor for a dramatic effect
When Cringe Tuesday ends up not being another YLYL for the first time
Morgz is the annoying Orange that evolved into a human.
I love the hair straightening one. She went super slow while he talked so that way she was at the tip of her hair when he said pause (instead of just not continuing her hair) and then the location in her hair kept changing during every scene. 10/10
it feels like this is porn acting but thats just beacuse the acting in porn videos and in these videos both are so extremely low quality and dont have relable story lines
I would hate to hear this guy's yell.
You should keep exposing him pewdiepie. He's trying to steal views from your guardian angel mrbeast.
When Morgz's viewers turn 9, he's gonna be in trouble
Dad gets in water
Me get the remote
Dad goes for a swim
Me pause get pranks
The girl is just pouring it to build up content
makes me cringe even more knowing i have the same accent
Doesn't H3H3 have a video that is almost exactly the same as this one?
Nobody:
Morgz' Mum: /👁O👁\
Me when the other guy in a 1v1 went get out of his tower 15:18
Wait did you just say morgz has a kid?!?!
No subtitles after 3:27
3:27 sonra alt yazı yok
when you said pause I paused and and it autoplayed a morgz video
I keep laughing everytime pewds does a morgz impression...
😂🤣🤣🤣the music killed me
I always cringe when watching Morgz videos. :(
They always talk soooooo loud! RIP earphone users
At around  3:45 when morgz said thats a beautiful place to pause on, my nasty 13 year old brain went to work...
Stop the ‼️violation‼️😂😂❤️
Litteraly no one:
Morgz and his psycho family: PAUSEEEEEEE
This is my new favorite video on this channel to watch when i need to laugh
Maybe we use an atomic bomb one last time..
You copied 100% from Ryan
driving towards a cliff
Morgan: PAUSE
His mother: NO MORGAN, NOOOOOOO
Logan paul: im gonna be the dumbest loudest most superficial person 


Morgz: Hold my PPAAUUUSSSEEE
thats 2 times you've roasted morgz
morgz   is annoying aaffff……….my 5 year old brother watches stuff like this
Screaming + always surprised =  a morgz video
9:16 That moment when MORGZ kill his mum for a video
Hm.. Maybe the Paul brothers aren't the worst YouTubers? 🤔
2:51 when Morgan girlfriend wants to kill him for this
6:34 just like when I pour milk out of the cartridge
Is that actually how the video was edited or is his editor playing us
morgz is an utter disappointment
I think I lost some brain cells watching this
This was such a good video LOL
morgz = exposed
weave = snached
hotel = trivago
legends say morgz mums still paused
Morgz needs to see Dr.Phil.... Like freakin NOW!
This was extremely hard to watch, I’ve lost 99.9% of my brain cells
I love this but I can’t stand morgz
At 8:20 in the backround she's just like what is my life?
Morgz mom: driving down highway


Morgz: PAUSE
I'm happy that youtubers like pewdiepie exist.
Please un-pause me Felix. You never unpaused me, I just want to see my wife again.
Mother giving birth

Morgz: PAUSE
Is the Morgz video staged??
5:15 did anyone notice that PerfecT rime lol
Can you do friday with pewdiepie again? 😭

Who fricking brings a remote to the shops what the hell
you already know morgz & his mum are celebrating cause felix just payed their rent this month
(•/\•) pewdiepie win dont give up :(
Does this mean I can pause Morgz’s whole channel?
What I if told you...







 ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
You read that wrong
Morgz is a copy of FAze Rug And Mr Beast
This was SOOOO hard to watch, definitely deserves the number one spot in cringe Tuesdays
just.. NO jost on pliz
9:09 top 10 anime betrayals of all time
MORGZZZZZZZZ 🛳🛳🛳
When u download an Adblocker to go dislike Morgz videos
Looks like Morgan is going to rip in A Morg.
Morgz jut copies everyone’s videos in my opinion
pewdiepie: you cant have a vid without 10,000 dollars 
mr beast: you cant have a vid without buying the store
Time Stop Porn is a thing.
Thanos about to snap
Avengers: pause
 Well that was easy
Does anyone out there that plays Fortnite realize that when morgz is playing there’s a pump in his inventory and they got vaulted May 9 th I think and that he is in tilted and out of no where he goes to salty springs
Don’t laugh, you KNOW how much females care about their hair
THIS IS PROBABLY HOW HE TYPES ALL HIS POSTS AS WELL
its time for COTW, boys
Pewds: Morgz is the most cringe

Morgz mum: Hold my orange juice
lol this is why you are my fav youtuber
Moran: pause to his gf
Morgan*puts his pants down*
Guys Morgz went 2 days without his mommy tucking him in (almost died)
Hello pewdiepie when you clicked pause last week my brother has been standing still since then and i need to feed him threw a pipe can u unpause next vid
Why does mom always look like she's being held in a sex dungeon
Before watching: Let's see what pewdiepie has in store for today
:D


After watching: 
ATTENTION: Warren Chappell has been copyright striking several YouTube independent creators, this is becoming an issue, be aware of this PewDiePie.
8:41 she’s just seeing the back of morgz head
I am not gonna lie That’s why I don’t like morgz
If u got the controller u dio
I went to school with this kid 
No more needs to be said
I like how at 8:23 he’s yelling at the camera and not his Girlfriend
Who else got a tuber simulator add on this vid lol
Jacksepticeye: I'M THE LOUDEST YOUTUBER!
Morgz family: hold my orange juice
When you try to copy mrbeast
Are they inbred ? 
I mean, the whole pornographic atmosphere and their IQ LowEr THaN mY gRadE is bringing some clear evidences on the table isn't it ?
All the dislikes are from people who fell for the morgz give away
Morgz facial expressions don't make you uncomfortable

We should've killed the Paul brothers before it lay eggs.
But it's too late.
The part when she falls off the treadmill 
She breaks her back without Morgan knowing, Morgan goes to edit the video
, comes downstairs she is still lying there
They have such a hard accent, and just scream..
When you said pause at us I got paused for an hour then my sister came in and Unpaused me don't ever do that OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9:12 at this moment she know she had messes up
It looks like someone paused her pornstar career ...probably bald martin
8:20 why she standing there like she finna kill morgz and his entire family
were they having a heart attack on the treadmill?


AHHHAAA WHAT DID U DO THAT FOR??!?!??!?!??!?


      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
how can ppl enjoy those vids they're so bad even pornstars are better actors XD
Be magnetic ads
 SUCKS
For a moment I thought the girl was his sister and I was very concerned
Did anyone notice how she tried to kiss his cheek, but he turned and it cut away at 8:10
looks like now pewdipie makes morgz and James Charles wow what are you doing people
Morgz is so cringe that he is funny
I've seen other ppl do vids on morgz
The entire video has both the plot and acting skills of porn videos
720p max???????
Family Stroke acting 💯
Every words they say are " S C R I P T E D "
Nobody:
Morgz: PAUSE
Why do you do this to me pewds. I go out of my way to avoid these tubers and you make us watch sooo much of it. 😭😭😭
Me: is that cole sprouse in the thumbnail?
I noticed some things in the hair clip.
A: The amount of hair sticking out of the straightener was changing after each edit,
B: Her hair was not burnt whatsoever,
C: The amount that came of was too straight to be real,
D: There would be burnt parts coming out when it was released, not the very straight cut.

So, does this mean that they put it on, quickly cut the video, cut off some hair, attached it to the straightener, put it in place, then restarted the clip and called it a day??
Dont know if he watched pyro do it hmmmmm?
She Said no juice,


Looks in the fridge....... All the juice you can drink!
Morgan: Plays fortnite





Scandinavian neighbor: 
nice mic quality felix :)
7:06 When Pewds tells you to pause but then you realize that you've been sitting paused in the same position on your bed for the past 2 hours.
my speakers of my laptop almost broke bc Felix is screaming the whole video long
3:29 Felix : "what am i watching at?im like what is this"
Me : "and you've just given it to us,goddamnt it"
Officer : U are under arrest. Stop resisting

Morgz : P O Z Z Z

Officer : Aight. That's it. Shoot him.
WHATS UP GUYS, THANK YOUR FOR WATCH- POOOOOOZZZZZZ
It's like a weird incest porno but whithout any of the good stuff
This is the reason volume normalisation exits!!
I love how you thought Morgz deserves the whole of Cringe Tuesday
this video is the peak of mankind
I like how when he shows the money that’s not actually $10000
The captions made me laugh a bit
Im Not Surprised if Morgz Is Here
This guy acts like Ricegum
Looks like Jake Paul
And sounds like KSI

And when the three YouTube cancers form the Triforce of annoyance they turn into Morgz
You also cant start a vib without screaming, unless your pewds
Audio sounds like a 13 year old on MW2
i think my speakers just blew up
11:02 is she calling her husband bAlD mArTin 😂😂
Coming up next:



Morgz apology's video
Morgz is really the most cringe youtubers ever
Morgz is bad at fortnite lel
They need grammys for this
Cringe Tuesday = Headache Tuesday

React to Carter sharer his vids are just 0:42
10:43 I got a shoulder injury.


Me:  To bad, my mom had to get surgery on her shoulder.
 
comment which is worse Surgery or Injury?
The editing is amazing.
morgz is awesome
Morgz: I’m giving away an IPhone X, now let’s start the $10,000 challenge

MrBeast: I’m giving away literally anything, now let’s give this homeless guy a home
1:11 Who drinks like that??!!
Btw, when morgz's mom burnt the 'mgz' merch, the iron was steam. Sooo...
Me: Look I can pause t series videos.
The whole time I’d watched this vid, I was dying laughing 🤣
Pewds: Morgz is the most cringe

Morgz mum: 😮😮😮
They could make the video into a timestop porn and it will still be unwatchable.
This family is heading for the 2020 Oscars
no one:

absolutely nobody:

morgz’s mom: 👁⭕️👁
These people casually bring a tv remote to the grocery store
His videos look like PornHub Step-Family videos without the nudity
For cringe Tuesday watch imjaystation 
He is very cringy
i almost disliked the video because i though that it was a morgz video
That's it. I am starting my quest to become Morgz step father. Wish me luck.
I look forward to cringe Tuesdays. I love it. thanks Felix, very epic.
Every thime the mom paused she look like a cheap blow up doll
i agree with pewds, that face of his mother is very uncomfortable
8:55 am 
I on YouTube
Morgz should have been pause when he made his channel
Was he holding pounds or euros in his hand?
"Just like when I pour milk out of the cartridge."
                              _ Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellburg
10:14 SHE WAS DOIN THE FORTNITE EMOTE

Why does his mic sound cheap from Walmart
Welp. This cringe tuesday definitely lived up to its name
14:45 Screw You Kiera I dont care about my hair

Another possibility is there just crack heads
12:22 I wish they had actually hit a car...
10:43 - "I've got a shoulder injury I can barely hold the camera"

The dislikes are morgz fans
spoiler alert

An actual Donald Trump add before this video. 







I mean.... ad revenue is great but tump on a PewDiePie video.....




Nah
Why does he sexualize his mom so much? It's honestly creepy
This guy reminds me the Jakovosaur from South Park
For cringe Tuesday go to a channel called paul
8:00





Is he constipated??
Morgz is a wanna be mr beast
this is unwatchable even as a joke..
His mom looks like an older version of cersi lannister
Morgz in a nutshell.
4:57
why's this morgan guy shouting so much?
I like cringe Tuesdays because it reminds me of what day of the week it is...
The best challange 

is die challange
are they using warhammer 40k music like wtf? :DD
WAAIIIT THEY ACTED THAT!!!   MY LIFE IS A LIEEEE😡
Funny the way that all of those clips look like the beginning of a porn
I think even Jake Pauls fans cringe over his videos
pewds: i dont wanna watch this anymore jeez. keeps on watching
thats a massive fckiing swedish meatball (morgz face)
Kan du göra detta till en serie när du reagerar på Morgz??? Skulle gärna vilja det
Dude i hate morgz cus he is stealing other people vids just like mrbeast and also he is selfish im sorry if he sees this but its true
It’s like porn acting, and it’s VERY uncomfortable.
Best video ever 10/10 :D
I mean hes still just copying other youtubers
Morgz just spams ads everywhere
Didn’t laugh so hard in a while thank you bro !
*cringe Tuesday's exist*

Fridays with Pewdiepie: am I a joke to you?
thanks for shouting out this... man?
13:47 That's His Girlfriend Dude...
I tried mealworms in 5th grade, they tasted like almonds...
I would LOVE to be neighbors with you
I was sure the music was yours, and the BRUH MOMENTS
jake paul has been RePlAcEd
Morgz = natural asmr
how does morgz manage to sound like a 50 year old guy from the pub
I need to know the name of that song.
Pewdiepie making fun of children is the quality content I subscribed for.
Can’t they press the off button on morgz?
Meal worms are good!
scroll down
9:11 Best clip of the video xDDD
PAUSE Challenge with SISTER and her BOYFRIEND (GONE WRONG) (GONE SEXUAL) (BOYFRIEND GOT PREGNANT)
Presses power button* PAUUSEEE
You had that music in your car video
I haven’t laughed this hard at a YouTube video in a long time
I want that background music
The Morgz family is the definition of cringe they are such bad actors (thank you all for the likes didn’t know I’ll get this many)
I think morgz gf wants to bream up with morgz
What would a man do when he does not what remote control is and pause means?
Yo, This guy placed 60th place and got pissed? Damn he sensitive
Why do you hate Morgz? You both should work together.
Morgz does realize that his audience is kids and not senile elderly people, right??
WHAT UP GUYS DON"T FORGET TO GET MY DANK MERCH IN THE * BRUH* DESCRIPTION
Pewdiepie: BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH BRUH.
Me: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
INTRO I thought u was watching PewDiePie. Not the worlds worst reality TV show
Why does he have that tv from 1999 in the corner
Cringe level is infinity and beyond
This is why Thanos should’ve snapped twice
I'am contaning myself from screaming alabama ^0^
Morgz whatever his name is so damn annoying 💀
Next time do more ameerah or just ameerah
Morgz is cool so stop
Its super cringey... but pewdiepie makes it better (thank you)
8:09 BRUH I really though they were going to kiss. That was really just to weird.....
Morgz just has a weird voice
Actually dieing "why the hell is he yelling all the time"
Why did you Put morgz
7:03 Felix you didn’t say unpause, I’m currently on my son’s phone typing for him because he’s still frozen. 
PLEASE SAY UNPAUSE. I NEED MY SON BACK. HE HAS EXAMS NEXT WEEK!
This turned into a Family therapy video once the kid said what a beautiful face to pause on
Morgz  is basically mentally insane
i was playing pewdiepie tuber sim while watching this ik lol
Is that really how the video is edited?? I thought it was just brad being funny lol
How many brain cells you lost watching Morgz 
👇🏽
I wonder what type of person buys morgz merch
how brings a TV remote




apparently mogzs family
👁👁
    👅
Logan Paul: Imma be the dumbest, loudest most superficial person alive!


Morgz: HOLD MY BEEEEEER!!!!
Is anyone noticing the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" decision music in Morgz videos? LOL! What the heck? #soserious
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME THAHT BACKROUND MUSIC HAHAHHAHA

Don't worry guys, we are currently investigating the case.
YOU WANT TAE GET A GLAWSGO KISS

6:28 look at the girl's face
Morgz’s family seems like they would be in a porn scene.
This Morgz video is the 
embodiment of why some people are just a waste of oxygen
Keen observation from the girlfriend in the car
Nobody:
Morgz: DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN CLAP*
2:52 me when playing a lot of games but still not getting any wins
do not say that about morgz
Plot twist: The channel is made for elders that's why he yells so much.
It was painful to watch this tell the end 😂💔
When you're in an argument with someone and you just don't want to hear what they say so you just scream over 4:55
Morg is sooooo cringy
They seem like that family in “Get Out”... 😳
i though jake paul is cringe damn this guy is 
OVER 9000
Why does he need to put a close up of his mom
I cringe when i hear the bruh sound whenever he pause someone
Have t-series sub bot ?
Who else crynged at the intro
This reduced my will to live by a very significant amount.
7:06 he never unpaused little Jimmy to that day
Most hillarios vid ever made
I'm just gonna let this play in the background, can't stand this morgz guy or what ever his name.
Pouring milk out of the cartridge
How many brain cells you lost watching Morgz 

Edit 600?? C’mon guys at least a thousand xD

Edit 2: 

👇🏻
10:23  when your mom said "this is the face i made when i had you"😂😂
Turn caption at 2:32 (English (UK))
That remote doesent have a pausebutton
I think they just found Martin somewhere.
I would enjoy it more if they pushed mute instead of pause
｡･ﾟ･(ﾉ∀`)･ﾟ･｡
morgz is so unoriginal copying mrbeast
How does morgz have subs?
Why Morgz mom didn't pause before his birth???
Ha my dad used to do this challenge except that instead of pausing people he would drink heavily and beat my mom in front of me...
That's what I call a Cringe Tuesday !!
I should tie someone to a chair and make them watch hes whole video catalog to see how fast they would go insane or be diagnosed with brain cancer...

This is new form of torture : Cancerous content
I downloaded a add app
This videos gonna make me have an aneurysm
His mom always looks like a cartoon blowup doll with that face... 8-O
i wished the entire family got paused on train tracks
Lmfao Gotta love pewdiepie’s impression of Morgz
Literally cant finish the whole video
That's some porn level acting right there.
It’s obviously acting bad acting OK man i hate morgan
he needs help if he gets that mad after loosing 1 game with 59 other people alive.
3:10 How You Lose Your Home
I love that cringe Tuesdays were made on my birthday
That was the cheesiest, most scripted thing I've ever seen in my entire life. And why tf does this morgs guy keep yelling?
Ever video is fake
Of morgz

All i know is morgz sounds so scripted
Morgz is way too cringy!!!
😂😂😂😂
What tf is this? Jake Paul apk version?
I had to listen to this on the lowest volume. Also pewds being like, “I don’t like that face, i don’t want to watch this anymore...” 😂😂😂 I’m dying
Just tell Morgz that you can pause the video instead of buying a remote control from Alibaba
Caps lock is on for morgz
NO MRGZ NO YOU GAVE ME BACK PAIN BUT SPEAKING OF BACK PAIN COP MY MERCH ON WUCKIN 3 DAYS 7 HOURS AND 69 SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*What if we use 100% of our brain*

Morgan’s girlfriend : 
if she crashes, we all crash
I have never heard of this 'Morgz' guy. But he needs to be muzzled. And cancelled.
When I wake up this is what I hear 4:57

this is the ultimate cringe, it’s so hard to watch
MOOOOOOOORGAN YOU CANT DO THAT IF SHE CRASHES THEN WE ALL CRASHES MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORGAN
Morgz is the reason I sometimes feel ashamed to call myself British
By the way they speak, it reminds me of PlaySchool... is it just me...?
Pewds you're hysterical😂😂 your videos have improved immensely over the last couple years. Keep on going and being the best at everything!!
Gosh....I just lost all of my brain cells....wathefuk
Screaming wont make you sound more realistic
I lost 9999 million braincells just from seeing that dude’s face.
I actually watch morgz
Morgz is just pure cringe
PAUUUUUUUUUSE!!
7:54 I love that he died in fortnite. fortnite is bad apex is for the actual humans
Endgame spoiler: 

Dr. Phil dies in endgame after using all his powers to send thanos to the ranch.
I really cringed so hard
I had a add about your app and I was watching this video
Who pays this man to make these videos.
the title of this vid should of been "PAUSE challenge, EXPOSED "not happy" $10 000 (Contains EarRape)"
Saw my cousin watching morgz today said it was his favorite
DOWNLOAD COIN MASTUHHHH :O
This music absolute cancer but such a good meme at the same time!!!
The captions are glorious
I wasn't aware of this hellspawn Morgz before this video. Now I am aware, and my life is slightly worse as a result. Also I have a headache because they yelled so much. Thanks a lot Felix
Pewds: Fixes camera quality 
Also Pews: Uses fast food drive through microphone
Driving a car smiles pause
MOGAN NO!!
When I pour juice out of the cartridge 😂
8:16 But PewDiePie I thought you never lost a game before
Don't let this video distract you from the fact that hentai haven is back up
morgz : pauze challange
pewds: cringe
I thought a lot of the editing was pewds but I watched some if the video (couldn't make it all the way) but no it is his own editing
Your right this guy is clearly staging this.
Should I Snap Morgiz, And His Ugly Mom!!

Yes Or No

3:21 she looks like that SCP shy guy
Before all of these videos needs to be a warning for headphone users
14:40 At this point I realised I watch too much porn. Thought he was gonna whip something out.
You know that you are cringe, when pewdiepie makes a video about you
It's like there talking really loudly because they think the camera is long distant calling. lol
I literally hate morgz
The gameplay is fake the pump is vaulted
14:35 her hair just slipped through the straitener
jacksepticeye: I’M THE LOUDEST PERSON EVER!!!!

Morgz familly: observe
Bruh PAUSE
I love you
I'm Danish
i cANt BrivE   iM lAGHTING
YO FELIX can you roast PrestonPlayz? He used to be a good youtuber, but now he's going the route of people like Morgz
9:13 look at that face








Pewdiepie's of course
14:32 anyone else see the hair magically get sucked back
It is fake but it’s like a game to play
Roast 100%







LUL xD
Pewds: Morgz is the most cringe

Morgz mum: 😮😮😮
Morgz moms face is a threat to humanity
I kinda wish 2016/2017 version of PewDiePie, the salty, sarcastic, edgy version of him is the one reacting to what happened with Morgz and JC lately. 

That version is the best for me, he would just say whatever he wants without holding back, making sarcastic jokes and statement abt these events. 
Lets make it to 100M Bros 👊
I like how in 14:42 her hair is barely in the straightener, but in 14:46 it's been put farther into the straightener again
Smiles and happy to you too
I cringe at how many 6 year-olds are stealing their parents credit cards to buy that guy's merch
Morgz is a Btec Mrbeast
They remind me of that one guy form attack on titan abridged by teamfourstar
i dont wanna watch this coz its so loud
Best video I have ever watched
Morgz should carry a plant around to replace the oxygen he wastes
You should play goat simulator
So at school people were making fun of him (morgz) by doing the pause challenge but screaming and talking in a British accent.
Morgz=Cringe
7.46 girl. Omae I wa mo shinde ru
Morgz. NONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEĔEEEEE
Wtf pewds. You forgot to unpause us.

 I HAD TO SIT DOWN 3 HOURS BEFORE MY MOM UNPAUSED ME!
Imagine Morgan making an apology video

HeY GuYs ToDaY i HaVe A VeRy SpEcIAl vIdEo!
What has Jake Paul done to this world
When I watch Morgz I lose brain cells by the second!!! SEND HELP PLEZ!!
It’s f*cking real!!!
Felix : "Its Tuesday my dudes"

Jimmy Here : *Sad Wednesday sounds*
I want to brake that guy’s voice box.
I can’t believe I am suscribed to that channel bro
1:16 pause at the right moment and you'll see something weird
Top10 anime betrayals
Man, we don't want morgz, just give us petscop 2 already.

Edit: Sorry, wrong channel.
I can justify abortions when I see when people end up becoming like this plug. Make something better of yourself bruh.
in the tv in the background you can see Atlanta
I thought "bruh" was pewdiepie editor
I have a headeque after watching this
Sorry for the low watch time Felix, I couldn't watch a single second more of that guy.
Never once do they actually press the pause button
12:19    Anyone notice that when Morgan paused his mom she stopped the car? He immediately turns the camera to Kiera acting like the car is speeding....... Qwality Content👌
4:53 got me dead I just can’t 😂🤣
i saw a vid with a similar concept on pornhub



PAAAAAAUSEEEEEEEE
Lets pause T series sub count
i love that pewds finally roasted the hell out of this kid
my friend is absesed with morgz channel and whenever i come over we have to watch it. i end up crying of annoyence and boredom. i know i can't spell so dont hate
Hearing his voice makes me want to kms
I can’t believe that Morgz has 9.7 million subs
Me: typing "mo-"
Google suggestion: "What is a morgz?"
They totally didn't script this








Just kidding. If I tried to make my mom pause while ironing my shirt she paused too  and my shirt will be burned.( totally true) 
That won't happen unless u have 10k on the line
I lost brain cells
falls

FAKE falls
Thanos: you should have aimed for the head

Morgz: PAUUUUUUUUUSE
The hair is just an extension hahaah
Anyone else notice how even after exercising the mom is wearing the same clothes
How does morgz have a 150 dollar tv but he can buy whatever he touches
I hate morgz
Wait, that's actually how the video was edited!? 

I thought Brad was messing with us.
I put the volume up to listen to Pewds screaming. I put the volume down to listen to Morgz speaking like he sucked a horse
Invisible man Don't mind if I do. 3:21
Thank u for that now I’m ready to die
so scripted ;-;
The sad thing is that there are kids out who consider this as content and would even buy or do whatever he'd say.

Whatever it takes
Whatever it takes
I just don't get what they were going for, if you want to make him realistic then you use a real hedgehog as inspiration, if you want to make him cartoony then you just need to use the game model and add some HD textures to it.


Instead they created this nightmare creature with the body of a person and the face of a deranged psychopath.

pewds is showing this community that we need to look at both sides and not to just mindlessly follow the crowd. RESPECT.
Pewdiepie didn’t go with the crowd and he was right. 
Who’s here after james’ clap back? 👇🏻
You know it’s bad when reasonable pewdiepie comes out
I can’t believe how correct this take is. Pewdiepie didn’t jump on the hate wagon and came to his own conclusion about a 19 year old being bullied by almost 40 year olds. Respect for Pewdiepie up massively.
Just came from the James Charles video... Pewds is right is this video. 
He truly is the emperor of YouTube.
In conclusion, PEWDIEPIE IS ALWAYS RIGHT
I’m back after the update, and this is why Pewdiepie is the top YouTuber
Comments last week: "i got to say im disappointed pewds" "i dont think you got her point" "youre wrong"

Comments today: "wow, youre so smart pewds!"  "you are right!" "thanks for making me see!" 

Me not commenting last week : 👀
literally the best youtuber. figured out the tati scandal wayyy before it happened. thank you pewds.
I think tati is speaking so calm makes people trust her immediately.
plot twist: tati’s video didn’t have any ads because the entire thing was one big ad.
Who here after they realized pewdiepie predicted the whole James Charles scandal 
⬇️
This feels like youtubes dad trying to understand what the kids are fighting about and in the end he's just, "pathetic. All of you" and I think that's beautiful

Edit: yall I don't steal comments... that other guy reposted this. Just because he got 13k more upvotes doesn't mean he made that. I don't care how many likes he or I get. But I'm not a fucking thief
Holy shit this guy knew it. Wow. All y'all calling him out for being wrong and not doing research look like clowns now lol, you played yourself.congrats.
Me 6 days ago: pewds you are forgetting about the important facts of the controversy with James Charles 

Me today: Pewdiepie was right all along about the James Charles controversy. I should of never doubted the worlds most trusted news source.
You really are a good human. Proved it again. Now I feel bad for the poor kid.


You are actually the role model not that lady.
Lmao and what happened to the "Felix didn't do his research' comments?
I've studied this scandal more than I've ever studied for my exams.
This is why he is the king of YouTube period.
I just subscribed to Pewdiepie because he was using his head.
Unpopular opinion:

Tati’s just overreacting.
I love how pewds always turns out to be right even though his opinion is fairly unpopular and probably disagreed with by a lot of people 🤡
pewdiepie being the father of youtube for 16 mins straight
This man believed James Charles when everyone else gave up on him ✊😔
When you were right all along. It’s all about the vitamins.
No one realised Tati was promoting her brand the whole time in her video except Pewds. 
This man knows what's up because he is the King of YouTube. 🙌
I totally agree with you, Tati just wanted to promote her own brand and she saw this scandal as the perfect oportunity.
“I'm here to spill the real tea”

Well, he wasn’t lying.
Pewds is really wise man. All he said was true when noone even agreed with him.
Felix was the first to see through all this nonsense.
I love how when Pewds just uploaded this video everyone was like “This video is poorly reasearched” but now that the crowd is going back to James side all the sheeps are like RESPECT PEWDIEPIE GREAT VID
tati: "fame, power and a fat back account will change almost anyone."



pewds: 
Applaud pewdiepie for having an independent opinion that goes against the accepted trend.
It totally boggles me how intelligent Pewdiepie is to see through Tati drama
You’re one of the most level-headed and rational Youtubers out here. Mad respect for seeing this before anyone else did.
When you've messed up so bad that even Pewdiepie takes notice
who’s here after pewdiepie proved everybody wrong? THIS IS WHY HE IS THE BEST ON YOUTUBE!
You guys think James Charles is going to do a giveaway at 100K
Tati being complacent of James supposed sexual predatory behavior until he hurt her feelings over vitamins didn't sit well with me either. I think she saw this as an opportunity to use him and sell her brand.
then people saying pewds didnt research the issue.. lol
in the end,pewds is right.
So the king was right all along. KING for a reason.
14:23 completely accuruate. She was FINE with whatever james charles was doing that she exposed him for yet when he promoted another vitamin that's when it became an issue
This is like the God of YouTube looking down on all the minor you tubers and judging them
James was smart and actually listened to your advice lol
Tati is such a drama queen. I commented this at the very beginning on James's apology video. Pewds, great way to see through the bullshit.
guess what pewds





u were right the whole time 😃
Logan paul goes into a suicideforest, films a dead body, edit footage of a dead body and then upload a video of a dead body.

James puts one contracted story of sleeping vitamins on his story and loses 1,5m subs. 

People are quick to point their fingers
I’m glad we have pewds because YouTube’s going to shit
after seeing james' new video, it's clear why felix is the king, he looked at everything with such a distant and rational point of view while everybody was just hating on james without knowing a thing and here he is standing up against all of us idiots, making me feel stupid lol 
he knows youtube and he's a fucking nice guy, he deserves the crown
YOU were right ALL ALONG!! I’m so proud of you Pewds.
Who's here after James's latest video and finding out Pewdiepie was right all along
Felix did make a great point. Tati did say she is fine with not having her vitamins not being promoted yet feels bad when James doesn't promote them. She says she's been like a mother figure and a mentor for him yet will go as far as ignore him and bash him out on the internet rather than talk to it privately like a grown adult. And she didn't hear his story out fully and instead ignored him.
PewDiePie: Not a Perfect YouTuber, But a wise man. 👌
Never doubt pew news. 
THE MOST TRUSTED NEWS SOURCE ON THE INTERNET
I'm so impressed by his critical thinking
Pewds drank the water of wisdom and logic.
From now on, I'm just gonna go with whatever PewDiePie says.
I think you need to rehire Poppy Gloria again Pewds. She was right all along
I remember when this video came out people were like "bruh u missed her point" while elaborating nothing on it. Guess mob mentality doesn't always win after all
James Charles could just have asked JK Rowling to make straight guys gay
#THANKYOUPEWDIEPIE, you gave a REASONABLE opinion, and you turned out to be RIGHT. WHAT A MADLAD
Im so glad you made this video. My eyes are thoroughly opened.
Pewdiepie deserves to be the #1 most subbed YouTuber and should be the #1 channel. He is a man of wisdom. Others were blind and agreed pewdiepie thought the other way.
He was right all along i rate how you did't jump to conclusion FAIR PLAY SISTER
Legend has it if you say "im straight" 3 times in front of a mirror James Charles Breaks into your house
Tati’s subs
Before this drama : 5.5 
After this drama : 10.5 
Well congrats👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Now we are beginning to understand who is trying to manipulate people
Pewdiepie was right all along boys and i remember this entire comment section flaming him for it. Goes to show that you shouldnt follow the masses and take the time to research everything!
Apologizes my king for i didn’t believe and trust you for the first time. Apparently Felix was right about Tati. She did lir...
I remember when people were like “Pewds didn’t do his research”



Where y’all at now
I wish people put this much effort into global warming
This really is the most reliable news source on YouTube 😂and btw all of this over some damn vitamins 💀damn Tati get a grip
James should me thanking PewDiePie because this somewhat clears the situation up
And everyone said he didn't do enough research...
“Ignoring this person’s calls and dragging them online instead”. People said that Felix was wrong and that James didn’t reach out to that Tati, but of course Felix is right. I hope ppl will stop being annoying ass bandwagon jumpers
This feels like youtubes dad trying to understand what the kids are fighting about and in the end he's just, "pathetic. All of you" and I think that's beautiful
LOL! Where are all those "dO uR rEsEARcH" comments now?
People coming back here to say they're sorry they were against Pewds in this vid, and I'm here like "I agreed with him since the minute I finished the video and didn't see him being wrong in the first place"
Pewdiepie was right! Everything was all about the vitamins!
Tati is that snake friend who’s jealous of your success but pretends to be care so much for you.
Listening to pewdiepies opinion on this is probably the most rational thing to do
I'm honestly so proud of James to come out there and say his truth. It's astounding how you were right all along but people doubted your research.
Good on you to stay away from the trends and say things how they are! Like they say, PewNews - the world's most trusted news source!
Bro pewdss was right, next time before jumping into conclusions make sure you guys understand both sides
Did James take your advice and have his new video written, directed, and produced by you?

Pewdiepie becomes next Shane Dawson, saving careers without an 8 part docuseries needed
All those people hating, but Pewds was right goddamn.
james charles: I'm sorry for betraying my best friends and sexually harassing straight men 


pewdiepie: I'm sorry for mixing up the dogs from up and secret life of pets
Goshhh after seeing Jame’s new vid....... I definitely subbed to Pewds this time...... this is why he’s got 95 million followers..... wise man
She just wanted more attention and she got it ( She doubled her subs in just 1 week) hahaha "Nicely planned" ;)
PEWDIEPIE OWNS YOUTUBE.. cause he's always right.
All of you attacking him because apparently he didn't do enough research, and now coming back because he was right all along.
when sleep vitamins ends ur career but a suicide vid doesnt
I'm glad YouTube's most subscribed channel is unbiased and honest and doesn't buy into the drama so easily + giving people a different perspective thanks to the influence
PEWDS JUST DID A REVERSE OOPSIE. HE PREDICTED THE FUTURE
I was honestly here for all the memes, butttt I lowkey feel bad for James. This was probably really traumatic for a teenager
We can see how matured Felix is during the video.

Respect
If this doesn’t make it into Rewind 2019, I don’t know what I’m going to do......
After watching the updates on the whole drama today, Haha i am laughing now on the people who criticize pewdiepie for not doing his research... and it turns out pewdiepie was right all along! 😂 


Everyone who criticize pewdiepie: Oooooppppssssiiiieeeee dddoooooooppppppsssssiiiieeeee
And now PewdiePie is right. Once again!!!
Papa pewds is right all along. This is why he is an intellectual and the king of youtube 😂
Us straight guys don’t even care about the beauty community, it’s just funny to watch the drama lol
James: I’m unshakable I’m a CELEBRITY

Tati: hold my vitamins
I love how everyone was against his opinion the first day this was uploaded and then when James came out with his video everyone switched their minds lol.
Pewds YOU are Dr. Phill and Sherlock Holmes version 2. Great job man👏
i personally think tati was just jealous that james had a higher following and was doing better than her in the beauty industry, and felt that he owed her something for helping him grow to where he is now. if this wasnt about boosting her sales and sub count, she would've kept it personal.
I'm here to spill the real tea

The taTea
James Charles next video: thanks guys for 10k subs
I respect Pewds for seeing this from a different angle, even though people were against his approach
Tati : I'll stand by my word
Also Tati : deletes video
Everyone is so gullible nowadays, that’s very sad. Facts over Opinions 👏👏👏
Lmao all those now obscure and deleted comments about pewdiepie being wrong and not knowing what he’s talking about did not age well 😂😂
This video shows why Pewdie Pie owns YouTube. Greatest channel on here.
pewds out here sharing some valid points. the issue itself is hella unclear and could have been resolved privately, just makes me realize how problematic the beauty community really is lmao
Pewds u were  right she manipulated YouTube, take me as your apprentice.
Felix was right and everyone went against him when he first uploaded this video. Dont question the king 👊
When pewd’s opinion turns out to be prophetic
Honestly Felix is one of the few reasonable people left on this platform.
Can we all just agree that shit went 180 real quick in the past 2 days
Petition to bring Gloria borger back!! She was right all along.
When I watched tati's video, it rubbed me completely the wrong way when she mentioned her brand and how she was talking about it. Just made me very suspicious about the whole video and her motivation making the video.
GOTTEMMMM! PEWDS WAS RIGHT HAHA! Yay so happy
When you realize gamers are more mature than the gurus 💆🏾‍♀️😂
she's literally describing herself when she talks about how dirty james did her lmao
Americans need Europeans to clarify our thought process. We thank you.
I'm back from the James Charles clap back and.... PEWDS WAS RIGHT, WE STAN👏🏻🙌🏻
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG LMAO, I just came back from james' new video lol
So this whole "Controversy" is over freaking vitamins? 
I'm just gonna stay subbed to James cuz this is just ridiculous....
Thank you. I 💯agree. A mother’s natural instinct is always to protect their kids, not to expose them & drag them through the mud. I’ve said this from the beginning. Shame on Tati.
Tati forgot the king of YouTube sees through everything🔥
THANK 👏🏻YOU!!! This is my exact thought ... she’s manipulating the whole thing.
Pewds: Gets better camera quality


Audio Quality: I don't feel so good Mr Felix
You were right, I'm sorry I didn't agree with you at first :,(
there's 171k comments and you just found mine, have a cookie 🍪
Never doubt pewds , he is the realest on youtube !! People who doubted him are all just a bunch of sheeps !
“It feels manipulative “
All hail the pewdiepie
tati: makes james whole career
2019 tati: it's rewind time
It's refreshing to have an opinion channel out there that used critical thinking before publicly denouncing someone.
Shout out to everyone that thought critically from the beginning !
The 👏most👏trusted👏news👏channel👏yet👏again👏proved👏
This is exactly what I was thinking when I watched her video. Didn’t sit well with me from day one.
Everyone: Logan Paul is the most hated youtuber of all time
James Charles: hold my lipstick
Alright my bros and 9 year olds, we have another target to annihilate from the social media.
I commented 6 days ago that I thought the same thing as pewds and I was immediately attacked for it but I still stood by my opinion. Now after the new video of James coming forward almost everyone who "cancelled" him is coming back.
Just shows that many people are not able to analyse a situation and form their own opinion. Sad but true.
Kinda ironic how dank community could use their logic more better than beauty community
Everyone on this video before james video : you're making an oopsie 

Everyone after james video : Opsieeeeeeee
Person: "I'm straight"
James : " sounds like a personal problem
Gloria poopie needs to be reinstated beacuse she was right all along.
You where 100% correct playa! First one to call it out!
1 week ago
The comments:
"Pewds barely did any research, omg he defended a sexual predator without knowing anything, smh."

Now:
James just pulled the biggest REVERSE card on the whole youtube community.
Tati: "I made your career"
James: "So?"
Tati: throws reverse uno card
Everyone should’ve believed pewds from the beginning. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Lmao we all came for Gloria when in reality Gloria was right the whole time 😭👏🏼 I have soooo much respect
Lmao, every Tati fan was talking shit when this video came out. But everything he said was true 😂
Absolutely agreed 100%. Tati's videos' comments sections are filled with "you're so mature and graceful" I'm like excuse me? Just bc she used a soft tone doesn't justify what she's saying. She's literally bullying another person, under the guise of the tears and "I love him". LOL. In the end it's still money that mattered to her. If James never promoted the competitor she would've never spoken a thing.
Jake Paul: I’m the most hated person on Youtube

James Charles: hold my pinkity drinkity
I wish I've listened to Pew before... I feel trapped in their game
Pewdiepie is like the mayor of YouTube right now. Hes the school principal. Hes the referee.  Hes the southern mamma putting all her kids in a separate time out (whilst making them pick what switch they wanna be beat with).
you're absolutely right. you're awesome putting your view out there when everyone was dragging james.
What if pewdiepie is the mastermind behind all this drama?
When a 16 minute video completely changes your ignorant opinion
"So pathetic, all of you... I'm out!" This dude would be a great big brother.
Everyone who doubted Poppy Gloria's research, you did an oopsie
Straight guys:*exist*
James Charles:*pic of Squidward as a pirate*I am coming for ur pickle
The first time I watched Tati's Bye Sister video I thought the same thing as you PewDewPie. I never believed Tati.
12million views in 15 hours.


YouTube trending:I'm going to pretend that I did not see that...
Looking forward to the pews and james collab!
Anyone else coming back here after James’s new vid? Pewds was right all along
He is going for 100 million AND YEA HE WAS RIGHT
tati: "fame, power and a fat back account will change almost anyone."

JUST LIKE IT CHANGED YOU, TATI? xd
Pewds gets better video quality
- Did you do it?
- Yes 
- What did it cost?
- The audio quality
“So pathetic, all of you”
The YouTube god speaks
There are 2 kinds of people here:
1- People who've never watched Pewdiepie before and are just here for the tea
2- People who watch Pewdiepie, don't know the tea and are very confused

I'm the first one😂👌🏻

Edit: There's now a third option for divergent people
A popular character in the beauty community turns out to be internally ugly and superficial. Go figure.
Do you honestly surprise that Pew's right?
He is the meme king, of course he is
Never thought pewds would make a drama/beauty video 🤣🤣
Cashier: That’ll be $4.85 

James Charles: bUt iM A ceLeBriTY
2019: THE YEAR OF PREDICTIONS COMING TRUE
PewDiePie was right about Tati 😂
He was right. All. Along. There was definatley something fishy with that story, pewdiepie sensed that and was totally right
James Charles Lost Over 50K in 25 Mins

Will You Guys Help Me Reach 1K in 1 Hour??
Thank you for thinking about the situation in a logical manner!
Im here after watching james charles pulling the reverse card
felix was right this whole time
Tati: HES ALIVE!! ALIVE!!!!! 
James Charles: Hey sister
Tati: I regret my choices of making you
Who was never subscribed to James Charles?
I want pewdiepie to react to James' new video "No more lies" please! 🙏
👏 PewNews most reliable news source 👏
I apologize for my words in the past, I will never doubt you again pewdiepie, respect.
2018: Pewdiepie vs T-series
2019: James Charles vs Tati 
2020: Shrek vs Thanos
I like how everyone disliked his opinion then seeing James Charles video WOAH everyone agrees lmao
Every since I saw this video I couldn't agree more than I ever
Yo pewds you called it man...just watched James recent video where he exposes Tati for her lies and manipulation. You were right, this was all just Tati throwing a tantrum over the whole vitamin competition XD
Everything you said I agree with, this was all pretty petty on their part.
Who is here after James's Video? 🙋🙋🙋
I respect Pewds even more after watching this video.
So your telling me this whole drama started because of..... VITAMINS 🤨 btw i have respect for Felix man💪🏽he is so right🙇🏽‍♀️
And people said Poopy needs more research. Tati's fans can cry in the corner.
Pewds was right after all. 
This whole situation was about vitamins. 👏👏
When I read what was going on between them I was like woah Tati is over reacting. I was right.
Felt cute, might seduce some straight guys later idk.
The absolute madman was right all along 👏👏
James came back with proof. She dun goofd
i just wanna know if poppy harlow is hired again? she apparently DID HER RESEARCH WELL ENOUGH!!!
Is everyone regretting saying Pewds was wrong? LOL
We love Poopy
If pewdiepie turned his channel into a tea channel I wouldn’t mind
Who came back from James's new video
To the tweet : Shawn never followed him ok? Dumdum
Thanks for the vid Pew xoxo
Lol where is all the long ass paragraph defending Tati and saying pews was wrong 🤔
This has been exactly my point since this all went down.
Logan paul: Im the most hated youtuber

James : Hold my pallette

But wai--- 

Tati: 
Poppy was right.
Pathetic. All of you.
Well this aged perfectly.
James Charles is cancelled wahwah

Edit: Lol they where cheering 15m subs
Glorie Poopie was right all along
I like it when pewds becomes controversial and stays on the neutral side
This video aged incredibly well
I love the way that Pewdiepie is just at the background sipping tea watching all the drama happen. 
😂👌👏
Edit: I wrote this at the start of the Vid. I didn't actually know he was sipping tea xDD
Who’s here after James video!!! I’ve agreed with pewdiepie all from the beginning
Friend: Who’s side are you on? Tati or James Charles?

Me: PewDiePie.
Unpopular opinion:

This tati woman be acting like she's 16 and james be acting all grown up and sober
James response video to Tati bought me here once again,  🙆and I have to say you were right all along
He knew all along 
That’s how you know he IS the best
lol I knew there was something fishy about this drama.
bYe SIsTers

Tati and James are gonna hit 10million subs together
This is why i love poods. He’s a rational man. He knows how to give the benefit of doubt. ❤️❤️❤️
I swear to god I'm going to like this comment


Don't break a swearr
''thinking is not fresh or fabulous,,
deletes brain with make up...
Modern Dr. Phil 😂❤️
Shane Dawson running to James Charles house to film a new documentary series

Lol
0:10 In wasn't Poppy Gloria in the video! It was Glory Poopy💩. Poppy got fired for nothing! Please like so more people can see.
Dude. Pew, I  thought the same as you 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🙏
Fans: How much hate do you want?
James Charles: Yes
Man i can't believe pewdiepie is actually RIGHT!
tati: makes james whole career
2019 tati: it's rewind time
Starting the felix kjellbergh religion. Who else wanna sign up?
Lol i wonder how those people who hated you feel now after james video 😂😂
Why doesn’t she just be successful in her own instead of being entitled just because you helped someone out
Anyone here after James’ video-
James lost 20k in 1 hour...

can i hit 60k in 1 day?
He was always right ‼️ who’s here after james threw down the uno reverse card ? 👏
Who is here after James Charles video
Tati was full of envy
Pewds was living in the future this whole time
“Fame and fat bank account will change almost everyone”

Felix: laughs in Swedish
Congrats Pewdiepie for actually telling us that Tati was lying the entire time
Pewdiepie predicts the future
I've been hearing about this story for 2 weeks without knowing anything and THIS IS IT? Wtf.
When we left off in 2019 we came to this...




Shaggy, Big Chungus, Officer Earl, Endgame, but most improtantly...





Jooms Choals
People: Logan Paul has the worst apology video

James: hold my sugarbears
Tati’s video seemed scripted. I wonder how long it took her to write it up or did she hire a ghost writer?
So he was right about this whole situation.
А че перевод не полностью на русском?(
Logan Paul: no one can fall harder than me
James Charles: hold my foundation
Poppy Harlow needs to make a video updating James Charles news. I'm 100% sure Pewds will rehire her! XD
So scrolling down here and wondering where the “dO yOUr ReSEarCh” comments went. Ya’ll hiding now? Thought you knew the situation if you could tell someone to do more research 😂👏👏comments review: 0/10 neds mor resersh
I LOVE THIS! This was literally what I've been thinking this whole time!
Lmao you got played problematic people. He was right all along! 🎀
the biggest oopsie here is this microphone quality from a millionaire
Not taking sides but it's really sad to see how fast and blind people follow the crowd and then change their opinions/positions on this matter, we r just like sheeps...
No matter who's the one telling the truth, CYBER-BULLYING IS NOT OKAY... they really should've just solved this bullshit face to face in private instead of publishing expose videos and starting the fire...
and as expected, pewdiepie is correct. our lord and saviour is always right.
James Charles, Tati and Jeffrey Star.

Who would you Kiss Marry and Kill?
PewDiePie literally took the thoughts out of my head. Screw the haters James
Logan Paul: I’m the most hated person 

James Charles: hippity hoppity the throne of the most hated person is now my property
6:56 promoting ads speed 150%

Making apologies video speed 75%
Felix was right 👏🏽
YOU WERE SO RIGHT :'D
I don't know why but YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT OMG😂
No one:
James Charles:
this is absolutely not funny, delete this or I will change your sexuality.
Thx for having Singapore as ur Windows Lock Screen lol @ 3:20
Who's here after finding out PewDiePie was right about James Charles situation....
Something that I’ve realized is that you’re always right. Finally subbing.
I did agree with you even from the start. Always been on James side in this! I do not know why everyone got so mad at you.
he needs to watch james video, im ready to see how hard hes going to make fun of the tati fans
turns out right all along

Glori poopy: ｙｏｕ　ｄａｒｅ　ｔｏ　ｏｐｐｏｓｅ　ｍｅ　ｍｏｒｔａｌ
Internet: Charles will have a scandal.
Charles: absolutely not
Later....... 
loses 3m
All y’all who unsubbed from James Charles look foolish now🤡
this workplace has gone [ 0 ] days without an oopsie
James Charles sounds like his nose is stuffed up
James Charles just uploaded a new video in response to all of this! 🍵👀 things are getting real sisters & bros.
James actually liked this video. Maybe his research was correct
Some guy: I‘m straight 

James Charles: DING DONG YOU‘RE WRONG
Wait, so this James Charles fella got shafted?
Pew news the most reliable news source on the internet 💯 ✔ pew pew pew pew pew
I remember when this video was posted before James made a comeback on tati most of the people in the comments was against pewds and tells him that he did not do enough research and turns out after james made the comeback all of them was like (suprised pikachu face) and pewds was right all along.

PEWDS is truly the king of youtube
Guys I Have A Feeling That James Charles Might Be Gay .... 🤷🏿‍♂️
tati: makes james whole career
2019 tati: it's rewind time
WOW, YOU SAID EVERYTHING MY BF AND I THOUGHT FROM THE BEGINNING BUT WE ARENT YOUTUBERS SO WE COULDNT REALLY SAY ANYTHING!👍👍👍👍👍
"I've lost more subs than you'll ever gain kiddo"
James Charles fans need to sub for respect I hope he acknowledges pewdiepie.
So much respect for you pewdiepie! This is why u have so much followers and we believe in you. U were right that this smells fishy! Watch Jame's Charles new videooooo
Jake Paul: Im the most hated Youtuber

James Charles: Hold my sleeping pills
I wanted to know about the issue but it's too long. Thanks for the summary Pewds! 😂
Who’s back after James’ new video
LMAO pewds saw through everything right from the start gg wp
I knew it!! Everyone was criticizing Pewds and by what it looks like the “you didn’t do enough research” comments are no where to be seen 😆. 
Also what’s with this “Jeffree is gon ruin James career” Had nothing to do with him in the first place and James showed receipts
Nobody: 


James Charles: I diagnose you with gay
guess what pewds, i think james took your advice 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
We all knew your were right all along Pewds
Who else noticed that he bleeped out “halo” 






No just me or is that normal
i don’t rly watch pewdewpie but this i LiKe💅🏼
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to everyone being annoying and making fun of my emojis and me bc i don't watch pewdewpie i don't even watch james charles the tea is just rly good so if you don't like my comments then bitch bye :)
This guy really deserves to be the king of youtube. Wow.. Respect
This is the reason why PewDiePie is the most subscribed youtuber
pleaseeeee watch james’ vid bc YOU WERE SO RIGHT
Tati tried to end James Charles. Well pewdiepie just ended Tati
back from j.charles
now people will realize, do not follow crowd,
make your own judgement, follow yourself.
All of those guys who shitted on you for not knowing the whole story looks like absolute spastic clownss
This just shows how wise and incredibly fair you are ...i admire you so much 😍
Ma boi was right all along
You just proved why you are the king of YouTube <3
They just fought over a sleeping vitamin

Boi if you want to sleep then exercise 
Now when your tired from exercising them sleep
Tati was the mom who thinks her son's behaviour is unexceptable and Felix is the cool dad still trying to figure out WTH is going on
This guy knows everything.
14:31 was exactly the point I was trying to make to my friends lol
Finally, a voice of reason! I sat through Tati's endless video talking about how important she is and she's a role model, and her husband is connected with CAA, and blah blah blah. I get how she's mad that he promoted a competitor's product, that's what she's upset about and I can see how she would be upset. But to bash him publicly without trying to work it out? That's just her using James' fame to create drama, I mean tea, and thus attention for herself. That doesn't make him a bad person. And a gay guy trying to hook up with and "convert" straight hot guys? He's DEFINITELY not the first and he certainly won't be the last! Every gay male friend of mine I've ever known has wanted to convert hot straight guys. Doesn't make them bad people! Tati needs to sit down and deflate the ginormous head she has.
Remember when the beauty community was actually about beauty? The good old days...
Hats off to you pew. Very mature dude
Came over from James' vid. You just gained a new sub Felix
Wow not gonna lie, this is the best news source ever lolol you've just predict the future
Out of 171k comments you found me 
Great gob ! There's no other thing to do..so...(like the comment)its my cake day
Before Video: doesn't know what's going on

After Video: doesn't know what's going on
Straight Boy: (exists) 

James Charles: 

Hippity Hoppity Your Sexuality Is Now My Property
Gloria Borger confirmed Sherlock actor next season
i learned in this video that memes and comments about pewds' video resolution is literally accurate.
welp. pewdiepie was right once again.
Jake paul: most hated youtuber


James charles: Hold my sisters
They called him a madman
You were right all along. I'm not gonna listen to anyone's opinions anymore except yours.
Well actually im starting to like James Charles a bit cause of Classmate.... But still we need to respect each side ;-;




My Classmate is a true sister :0 lol but still respect
Damn....this guy is good 😎 king of YouTube.
When pewdiepies 10 second apology about getting the dogs confused is more sincere than james 8 minute scripted apology
Tbh i didn't understand about this scandal, would someone spill the tea?
HE CALLED IT. BEST YOUTUBER EVER
Your unbiased and rational opinions are the best. God bless
Congratulations James Charles For hitting 13 mil
I honestly love how Pewds stands on this whole situation
“Pathetic, all of you”
Legendary 😂😂
It's the Met Gala that's the underlying issue here : jealousy PewDiePie
Right now more people have watched this than James Charles has subs. (・∀・)
I… I was confused about the situation before I had any idea of what was going on, but now I’m even more confused.
Сука, блять, я ахуеваю от этого видео, секс
Tati - Gains 1.5million subs


James Charles - loses 1.5 million subs



Thanos - Perfectly balanced as all things should be
Yes thank you! 👊🏼 it’s not picking side. It’s creating this fiasco to bring attention to your product.
PewDiePie? Cool
James Charles? A P P R O V E D
Soviet Union? Dissolved






Hotel? Trivago
We stan a clairvoyant king 👑✨🙌
This many people respect Pewdiepie more than before.. 👇👇👇👇
James Charlie’s subscriber rate is declining so straight that he wants to date it
Who is here after finding out James is innocent?
AFTER WATCHING JAMES CHARLES NEW VID I CONCLUDE YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG
You were right about the Tati and James situation. I knew it, I knew something wasn’t right about Tati. Everyone immediately chose her side but not us
Ringtones I had ever heard in my life*

nokia ：tinininintinininitinin
apple ：shakalakabomalaka
my phone ：when you say your fine, but your not really fine...
Pewdiepie: no oopsies this week

Poppy Gloria: hold my G-fuel
In CONCLUSION, Ladies and Gentlement.. PewdiePie is damn Correct
You Pew bro lmao. Everyfux'n time this thumbnail pops up on my screen in the app I die. 🤣😭🤣💀💀
This ironic news show is starting to feel oddly legitimate. 
If y'all didn't see the new drama alert. Turns our Felix here was onto somthing.
This aged like fine wine.
It’s scary how Tati, Jeffree and the entire beauty community were willing to cover up and stay quiet about James’ predatory behaviour UNTIL he hurt one of them
For those who don't understand what's going on, here
@ 

The most honest and unbiased perspective regarding this Tati-JC situation. Better than poppy gloira!
James Charles grew past her. Apprentice outperforming mentor. She is contradicting... She has some unresolved issues with being unappreciated. Wants to be sure she is viewed as moral. Condescending and petty to do what she did...
OMG You are the king of youtube. Thanks for taking news to the next levels.
YouTube already showed me the same ad 3x already and the video is still nothing -_-

I demand Justice
Projared: no one can lose as many subs as me


James Charles: Hold my makeup
When you have to check the video quality and realize it is STILL on 1080p.
You were right all along
1:35 James Charles losing JEEZUS LORD ALMIGHTY

Poor James )8
u really did got the point pweds!
Looking at tati's video quality, then looking at pewd's, hurt my eyes
This can be summarized as roasting someone on a restaurant loudly and everyone got impressed
Let's talk about something more interesting than James Charles. How did you get this awesome video ID (3m4mF9-7L-Y)?
James lost 3mil 
Can u guys help me get to 100? 🙏🏼
Hahaha... poodz is right.. and some people been hating him for this video.. haha.. good job, still the most trusted news
Video quality: 1080p



Audio quality: 144p
Is it supposed to automatic that german subtitles starts playing?

Wolfstreet journal: Pewdiepie is Anti-semetic once again. Back to old hobbies eh?
watch this instead of watching a 40 minute youtube video.
How the turns have tabled, let's see all the dhs that were giving Pewdiepie a whole stack in the comment section lmao
Rewatched the video because pewds was right all along!!
If Tati exposing James doesn’t kill him, Jeffree will
Turns out, you were absolutely right.
i never knew who james charles was until i watched this vid
I love how they updated the captions.
DEDOTATION: 1OO
Tati: “I gave you your career.”
James: “So?”
Tati: throws reverse uno card


Edit: I am aware I copied a comment. I just thought it was funny .-.
how to completely change my mind in 16 minutes
Pew hear me clear:
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home

                             
I had to double check and Make sure I'm subscribed to u lol
This comment is @ every person that tried to tell me Pewdiepie was misinformed when they didn’t know the whole truth themselves 
Note: the whole truth will never be known but at least i didn’t bandwagon xx
Tati Made Him
Tati Destroys Him
Perfectly Balanced as all things should be
I said Pewdiepie was right from the start. And look where we are now lol.
unrelated to the topic but I love your headphones and chair XD my favorite colours XD
Who's here after watching DramaAlert's video?
Hands down the king of YouTube was always rigth
Nobody:

James Charles: Hipitty Hopitty your sexuality is my property
The quality of this video is amazing.
LOL this video has aged well. All those dumb fans of Tati commenting here must be pretty embarrassed.
Thank you for caring enough to be brave. Your well-thought out opinion is desperately needed to clear up this mess of half truths and irresponsible behavior. You stood up, showed us the evidence, and told us your honest conclusion even though it countered the rants of a lynch mob.
This video aged like a fine wine
tati: makes james whole career
2019 tati: it’s rewind time
Just thank you. Finally,  a logical perspective.
I come back to your videos for the actual analysis... Very rare and very refreshing to see someone that doesn't take sides and researches the nature of events.
Bless you sir.
In conclusion:




The beauty commiunity is toxic af
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Passive-aggressive Tati hiding her rage behind a nice girl image, while she grinds you up in a meat grinder.
James Charles: no one can end My career

Tati: hold my vitamins
You gunna watch James video "No More Lies"
I appreciate your perspective. Makes me question Tati.
Poopy harlow did AN OOPIES

PLEASE FIRE HER
It seems to me that if you're straight and get with a gay guy, were weren't that straight in the first place.

Then again I've made out with girls when I was drunk.
This is why Pewdiepie has almost 100million subscriber. He is a very wise man.
thanks, i legit had no clue what was going on so i understood none of the memes.... now i do, thank you
I agree 100% with this whole video wow
People blow everything out of proportion
Jake Paul: *5 mil on YouTube in 6 months never done before! 

Tati : hold my vitamins 

Yes this is a recycled comment
I'm happy I never supported Tati❤
Damn Pewdiepie should be a lawyer😂😂😂
I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG! I'M SO HAPPY I DIDN'T SUPPORT TATI!
Who else thinks Poppy Gloria should be re-hired now that it's confirmed that she was right all along? 
⬇️
Of course pewdiepie was right he always is
HOLY SKSKSKS JAMES CHARLES HE IS ALMOST ON 10 MIL yay.
6 sides: hexagon
7 sides: heptagon
8 sides: octagon
James Charles: wholecareergon
I really like your mic. Sounds really GOOD
The way I see it, this is all caused because people are too sensitive and can't handle shit. LET ME PLAY YOU A SONG ON THE WORLD'S SMALLEST VIOLIN
Kids, always listen to the father of YouTube.
PewDiePie is a Jedi of Youtube at this point , respect Master
Glad that someone actually got this whole thing right.
Omg he sad everything i was thinking about. Maybe james is an ass but tati did something worse. Like she is 37, shame on her. She is not any better than james so i don't understand why everyone suddenly loves her duh
I'm happy that I just kept all my opinions to myself.
SCP-GAY has been eliminated, Enemy KIA
Let’s go home boys, the work is done here
Edit: DAMNIT, HES GAINING AGAIN, BOYS, ATTACK
No one:

James Charles: Pinkity drinkity, everyone's gayer than they thinkity
A YouTuber who with sense and reason...what a breath of fresh air.
He saw it coming y'all.
LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR!!!!!



.......



of YouTube 😂
Her name literally means shit. what else do you expect LOL
Jake paul: everybody hates me

James Charles: hold my makeup
"How many videos i have to watch" 

Literally me
His last "Yaaaay teea" is a completely accurate description of me
The words of wisdom has been spoken !
PewDiePie: His friend's, wait uhh her friend's
Me: Same
Pewds is actually thinking about this smartly and from a moral perspective, I'm so glad he made this video

Edit: Thanks for the 3k likes you guys! HAIL PEWDS
Just coming back to this video to flex on all the people who thought us madmen for siding with pewds perspective
Ah, I see Pewds watches JablinskiGames...fellow man of culture indeed 
sips tea
Me: WAW new Vitamins Pills of TATI..
James Charles: Hold my Insult...


DUH.....LMAOOOO
Congratulations you were 100% right 👏🏻
Honestly James wasn’t looking so good in the apology and I’m just wondering whether he’s been taking his vitamins....
Tati is 37? Wow she look like she is in her late 40s
I agree with you 10000%
The way you explained your thoughts was perfect.
I came back for the comments that were telling Pewds to do his research before giving his opinion lol
Pinkity drinkity
subs went shrinkity
but it doesn't matter
i'M a CelEBrity
And again, Thank you Pewds for watching that 40 something min long video because I sure was NOT going to watch it
Please do video about this with the answer of jeffree star haha
So James Charles isn't actually cancelled?
I agree with this soo much. Thank you Pewdiepie ^ - ^ you’re amazing and soo clear minded :)
"So pathetic. All of you", Felix, 2019.
Pewdiepie was right all along. He has taught us to not just follow the crowd like sheep. PEWDS IS THE GOD OF YOUTUBE
when I heard about the sitution, this was exactly what I tought. Thank you for being rational and not joining the witch hunt (i didn't know who james charles was until this drama btw sdfgdf)
Pewdiepie is the FATHER OF YOUTUBE
WE NEED TO GET POPPY GLORIA BACK! !
"congrats on 15 mil been here since 16"
SAVAGE xD
I can’t even interpret how much I agree with this man.
Respect for PDP before this scandal: 100%.
Respect for PDP after this scandal, where he has proven himself to be a sage once again: 100% which cry that they can not be more than 100.
13:48 you can even see where she links her product in the description of "the hardest video she's ever had to make"... hmmmmm lol
In conclusion...







MICHELLE PHAN SHOULD COME BACK TO FIX THE BEAUTY COMMUNITY CAUSE IT WENT TO CHAOS WHEN SHE LEFT.
Will James Charles get another Diamond button for hitting 10M subs for the second time?
Came back to see, everyone in the comments change their mind and say he was right 😂



I'm amazed how I was right too about this drama, well can't wait for a new explanation video from tati or jeffree
The tea glugluglugluglug 😂 
BIGGEST OOPSIE OF 2019 💩
lets compare...
2018 youtube rewind and james charles apologies video!
Ok so...u made this vid so boring by using too much of tatis vid
Can we talk about the fact that James Charles’s sub drop is bigger than someone who filmed edited and posted a dead body hanging from a tree. Well done people 😂💀
Amazing video, glad you talk seriously about the topic. Much respect
Nothing really happened so why is this a thing
He was right all along
honestly Tati seemed dishonest from the start, I don't know why people are always so quick to believe everything and cancel someone ... 🙄
James: "Tati"
Tati: "Bye sister"
Jefree: "PINK VAULT CLOSET TOUR"
There’s a reason why his the king of YouTube.
Thank you for supporting James Charles
Pewds is the real star in this scandal. Damn, he is not even the beauty community. Salute.

YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

He lost his subs are lower then my grades. XD
Pew New: breaking news, everyone did an oopsie, except pewdiepie!
U had one of the kitty ears wrong way but great vid. Luv it
Congrats for being right dude
Pewds gets better video quality
- Did you do it?
- Yes 
- What did it cost?
- The audio quality
James Charles is about to kiss with you


Like to undo
Comment to push him away and slap him
I've seen so many logical critical comments under their videos. And I thought "wow, cool". And now it appears they all replicated Felix thoughts 🤔
James charles bad. Me very good very good🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.lmaoo
omg now james charles is a vegan,AFTER HIM HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED
Did you get better video quality ?
Yes.
What did it cost?
The audio quality
honestly i thinkat first,  the issue was so small but yknow social media is attacking and im slowly taking to tati’s side and watched simplynailogical’s predictions but i saw this.
JAMES DID AND OPPSIE 
*falls down *
BIG OPPISE
All I hear are facts👏🏽🗣
she just proved she's used him because he's a kid and is an influencer
Jake paul is the most hated youtuber


James Charles: Hold my makeup
What a fuxking





NOODLE
You got great points there!! Really good video nice Work
I also didn't understand why she resolve this privately
Felix recently awakened the Mangekyou Sharingan that's why he knew this before it even happened
Paul brothers: we're the most hated people on YouTube.

James Charles: hold my pinkity drinkity
didn't know you made a video about this stuff hahah lololol. but YES EXACTLY. thank u
I knew something was up. I think those three are up to something.
TATI AND JEFFREE ARE CANCELLED!
You need to rehire Gloria/ poppy poopy! She was right the whole time. Sad how everyone was quick to criticize you for "not doing research" 

In reality people need to STOP being quick to join a stupid hate bandwagon
lmao literally i didnt jump on the cancel culture because i was suspicious of tati
GO WATCH JAMES’ VID!!!
When #tati was the reining queen but #drphil ....uhhh...uhmph.... I... I mean #pwedipie breaks it down and drag her to filth
Me: hi bro..

James Charles: Hi SiStErS
Tati: BYE SISTER...
James: tati
Jeffree: my pink VAULT closet tour
Pewdiepie: 👏 content 👏
He was right all these times lmao. You have to give him credit for that.
They hated Felix because he told the truth
Pewds is god like bruh he is wise af
Tati STARTED his career

Tati ENDED his career
This whole thing is more interesting than an Netflix series, and of course Felix is right all along.
Wow you should be a lawyer.  Your mind and logic are amazing 🙌🙏I'm way too emotional and gullible how did I miss all those facts in this video ?  😆this is so well disected🙋I thought she was gentle, kind, honest,  sensitive, giving and genuinely worried about him.  😯😵😱
I think it changed tati so much more than to James charles
Is this Eminem Vs Kelly gone wrong ? 🤔
Nobody:

Not anybody:

Not even J.K. Rowling:

James Charles: 
you got big balls man respect
Their's a reason why felix is still the top best tuber.
i hate everytime someone is saying : SPILL THE TEA


IZAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!( which means crap )
ps: i love how pewdiepie is making fun of this
You see how active this and supportive this community with multiple comments days after the video came out have thousands of likes 

I’m so proud of this community
Finally a big Youtuber with a brain speaks up.
I was lol when I figured out she was exposing him because of her brand
I- 
James has been exposed
0:10 In wasn't Poppy Gloria in the video! It was Glory Poopy💩. Poppy got fired for nothing! Please like so more people can see.
Your perspective made me subscribe. I know I’m just one person, but I hope I help get you to your next benchmark. Thanks for your honest viewpoint from a new fan! 💕
Logan Paul: I am the most hated person on YouTube.

James Charles: Hold my vitamins.
I appreciate this video more than Tati's original video lol
A little disappointed that you mentioned projared at the beginning then didn’t actually talk about him
KING PEWDIEPIE WAS RIGHT
Как говорится:
 Я тебя породил, я тебя и убью
Tatianos: snaps fingers



James sub count: 
Looks like some one predicted the outcome correctly...
Fat bank account ? 





My bank account must have been doing cardio too much
i stan. You are truly a legend.
Me 6 days ago: THIS DUDE GAY


Today: THIS DUDE GAY, but PEWDIEPIE is right
PewDiePie: fixes camera quality
also PewDiePie: loses audio quality
perfectly balanced as all things should be....
Some one commented that i should watch this video thanks 😊😊😊
Clever guy. Are you up for being my life coach? Need the rational outlook 😘
I think the product that James promoted is rival of Tati's
Damn when the vitamins don’t even help the same thing 😂 

I didn’t notice this before
James Charles Lost Over 50K in 25 Mins

Will You Guys Help Me Reach 1K in An Hour??
This is why you deserve more subs than t series
FAIR AND LOVELYY
knp si:(
2:01 me everytime bts paves the way
I never understood what Tati was even talking about so James Charles is bad because he promoted a product that wasn't yours really? That's some petty shit but at least she admitted this went way too far. I don't think a good friend would make all of this public in the first place.
Your apology for mixing up the Up dog and the Pets dog was more genuine than James' apology

EDiT: oMg THaNks FOr tHe LiKEs iM FaMOus
omg just noticed all the Jeffree Starr all in the back the entire time in Tati's vid.
The king was right, the king is always right!
Sooooo congrats again James, 13 Mil been here since 15
Allah’ını seven şuna Türkçe altyazı eklesin amk
if James Charles subscriber get to 10 million will he get another diamond play button??
Okay so you made some one think there gay(not u pew) now i point a gun to ur head(james)
Wow. This man is a genius!
Omg what are you? How come you're always right? Hands down to the ultimate youtuber!
The Pragmatic Genius.
Straight man:
James Charles:Ding Dong your sexuality is wrong
i didn’t know what happened and stopped watching because i got bored 😳😳
You are the best for being objective and staying on topic without actually jumping to conclusions. SUBSCRIBED
Gloria's recommendations must've been worse after every PEWNEWS
(by just watching all of these videos)
All i can say is................





Lmafo
They called her a madman..
Gloria Borger knew everything. This is proof. And that Tati, you can see from her speech, that she is naughty.
I love the thumbnail.
okay but like, everything he said was 110% correct. I love you p.
"So pathetic, all of you."

I love it
So. The haters are confused? Because this has 1.2 mil likes. 16:22 Hello world of 2019.
(música perrona) JAJSJAJAJAJS
So?  Who's gonna remove the english captions that this vid is poorly researched?
Thank you for doing the research for us. I was confused before I saw this video about it.
"Saying you're going to do good things means absolutely nothing"


PREACH
When the nokia started ringing I looked at my ancient noki aand I went ''is that you??!!?!?!?''
nvm
And they called you a madman....
The GIST you talked about Sensei is the very problem
tati: makes james whole career
2019 tati: it's rewind time
PweDiePie made everyone shut up! Damn he knows what he says! Awesome haha
Wow on point ! 😱😱 
New Sub here lol after all the drama! 😁👍
Damn you called it
I doubt very seriously that James can dupe a heterosexual man into thinking he is gay.
People that can decide that you are gay:
-James Charles
-J.k. Rowling
clicked the video because i enjoy the thumbnail. hehe. poopie
Yooooo he called it!!! He was right!!!
James charles : Tea time !
Idk : Here the motherfu*king tea
All : unsubribe
James probably saw this video and took your advice 🙃
1982: I bet we’ll have flying cars in the future!

2019: James Charles and Tati fight over vitamins
Gloria👏 isn't 👏 getting 👏fired👏
Now I can never watch anything ever again without over analyzing 😬
You saw right through her
ABSOLUTE MADLAD
I am never unsubscribing to pewd.
2018: Lele Pons: iM a lAtInA
2019: James Charles: iM a CeLeBrItY
And they called you a madman

But you were right 👏👏👏
Logan Paul: no one can fall harder than me
James Charles: hold my make up palette



tATii: hold my vitamins...
Thats right you toxic butthurt people of the beauty community, now you know who is the one above all on this platform. He see's all and knows all.
Poods microphone audio died as well as his video quality
Nobody:


James Charles: bipity bopity ur sexuality is now my property
You saw right through her... as I did too.  I knew she was trying her best to ruin the kids career.  She saw a teenager's YouTube Channel soar and she couldn't handle one bit of it.  Jealousy and greed took over her.  Evil.  I got to say though, that James kid is really intelligent.  Would make Johnnie Cochran look like an amateur.
I knew that James was right and now I can see I knew it
I'm here to see a bunch of people eat their words. Who else?
So much respect for Father pewds. 👏🏽
Its funny that the most subscribed creator is more down to earth than creators with barely 15mill subs
I agree, we had a current affairs quiz asking who ruined James Charles career and everyone was clapping for her
Next video: Tati is cancelled
That thumbnail is horrifying
i should probably watch your videos first for any scandals that happen...👍🏻
Literally no one: 

James and j.k Rowling: you are actually gay
Not yet, boyssss 
And girls.
Now I know why you deserve the 95M 💕
I feel like James was just attacked with no context although I'm not on any side anymore I'm going to say James's Newest Video makes Tati and Jeffree look like liars.
Люди из СНГ, лайкните типа крутое написала. Пусть иностранцы мучатся что я тут такого написала
James Charles vs JK Rowling: who can turn the most guys gay?
Damn I nearly completely fell for the bait. I always had this feeling that something was wrong but due to how screwed up the community is, I leaned more towards the one who did less damage. But luckily, I was neutral in this case.
Tati deserves a million subs loss not charles.
Pewdiepie seen before anyone that James is not what Tati said( why pewdiepie is top yt and should have 100m subs tbh
He just predicted the future
Pewdiepie: fixes video quality
Sound Quality: Am I a joke to you
She is so manipulative
I always thought this Tati drama was stupid and I knew that piewds would see through it!
"so pathetic, all of you". lol
I saw another video on this that did not mention James apology. 
Good coverage of a complex issue.
Tati and James should go on Dr Phil
REHIRE BACK GLORIA BORGER <3
I just liked that next to the tati video you could see Jablinski Games in Felix's recommended.
Crap... I way watched the bye sister video before this one 😐
Pewdiepie you was RIGHT!!
Straight Man: * exists *

James Charles: HIPPITY HOPPITY YOU ARE NOW MY PROPERTY
You just opened my eyes, thank you pewds!
it's clout vs clout, everyone is afraid to step up themselves
At least, he has 14mios back and tati is a liar 
they say
2:02 Me when I find some tea, preferably earl grey.
Random straight guy: exists
James: slides into dms
Random straight guy: I'm straight
James: Well I'm a celebrity
Turns out he was right😂
Who’s here after JC vid she’s honestly sick
and he was right lmao
I'm so confused who is James Charles.
"Congrats on 15M been here since 16M"

Best comment they ever had!
You opened this issue to a whole new reasonable perspective, love you so muucchh!
Pewdiepie was ahead of his time  😂😂 james played reverse card
Lol that "fame, power and a fat bank account will change almost anyone" line just sounds so cringe now.
logan paul: i’m the most controversial content creator

james charles: hold my pinkity drinkity
Pewds must have travelled in time and back. hOw DiD hE kNoW?
poppy being right all along 
poppy: they called me a madman😂
JAME CHARLES IS UNCALLED
ALL HAIL THE YOUTUBE KING
James Charles’ subscriber count:
“IT’S REWIND TIME”
No matter how flat you make a pancake, it has two sides. -Dr. Phil.
I am Indian and I love t-series and bollywood and my culture. But I love the fact that you saw what was wrong in this matter and brought light to it when everyone was just dissing and hating on James . Thanks 👏👏
Omg he was right
Tati did an oopsie
Pewdiepie did not do an oopsie
James Chargles Reverse Card

James Charles: hold my sexuality
Every gamer knows if you want to unlock the relationship achievements,don’t use cheat codes.
4:11; That’s the dog from Up, you uncultured swine. Pewdiepie does an oopsie.

Pewdiepie: "This is not how we tjälk"
Therapist: Tuber Simulator isnt real it can't hurt you.


Tuber Simulator: THIS GAME IS STILL RELEVANT DAMMIT.
0:58 "That's for Pew News"

Jake Paul:Im the most hated person on youtube


James:hold my pinkity drinkity



ProJared:wtb me

The dog is from UP, not Pets 👍🏻
Scandinavian ProJared:

Djivörce
I'm scandinavian, and I approve the scandinavian memes
4:14 d-d- dog from pets?? that's doug from Up, you uncultured swine
Pewds: you know you've messed up when Garfield looks better than sonic


Sonic: Hold my spikes
The Scandinavian meme was to funny, my chest hurts from laughing to much.
Scandinavian ProJared: CHJËÄT
Therapist: ur girl friend is not real she can’t hurt u 


Girl friend: NON EXISTENT
Dude I am Dutch and those Scandinavian memes are seriously making me LMAO
technically Pennywise is a Scandinavian clown in the movies cuz Bill Skarsgard, the guy who plays Pennywise is Swedish.
PewDiePie: Haha, thank God I'm not the one in the controversy today.

"Today"

Scandanavian man swearing in english:
Fjück Yöu
NotSoProJared. He should've put more skill points into his stealth abilities
8:00 "to me this is funny because it is 100% accurate"  out of all Scandinavian countries Finland differs 'cause Finnish doesn't even remotely remind other Scandinavian languages. But all Finns do learn Swedish in school so I guess I have to let this will pass. This time.
Also, this is random, isn't the sound that a horse makes in Swedish "gnögg" or smth?
Cheats on wife...

ProJared is the final form of epic gamer
ProJared: "I hate all this backlash"
James Charles: Sis, I got you!

i think the Scandinavian memes got funnier because Pewdiepie could actually pronounce them
Scandinavian with flatulence issues: I fjörted
No...it's not just funny for you, Felix.
It's frickin' hilarious to all.
How does he know about whats coming next on pewnews 🤨
Seeing jontron get one over on this backstabber is sweet!
NO BONUS MEME?!?! shjön of a bjïtch
Pewdiepie: Scandinavian memes are racist.
Also Pewdiepie: laughs the most at the scandinavian meme that makes fun of short people
When you get your test back:
A Broken Marriage /10
This meme review gave me a good chuckle, love you Felix💖💖
Projared : I can lose up to 100k subs in one day 
James Charles : hold my gay
If a meme gets a broken marriage out of 10 it's actually 5/5
Nobody: 1/4 or so of humanity is cheating at the moment
Social media: 2 youtubers cheated, REEEEEE!


Jontron: 
Every time I don't see bonus meme... I die a little more.
I rate this video 





A broken marriage out of ten 👏🏻👏🏻
You really know that we live in 2019 when your divorce becomes a meme

Wait, does this mean people are now anti-Jared?

LOVE FOR JOJI
Sorry guys, Like any internet scandal gossip story. I don't nor won't believe. A single solitary word of this story. Until i can see it covered on CBS, Fox, CNN, NBC, ABC, VH1, MTV, Local 
newspapers. If none of the more reliable news sources ever cover this story. Then....that tells me there is no story to cover. Outside of social media gossip. 
I really wish others would use that same kind of discretion. Specially in a story like this one. Where just the allegations alone. True or false, can ruin a person's life.
Just what if you're wrong??? You've just falsely accused an innocent person of something this bad. One ot the most heinous crimes a person can possibly commit. Hurray for maturity
Scandinavian ad:
What? You never played Tjöber Sjmülatjor?
gotta be honest, he was way out of her league, her Zelda cosplay is amazing
>Honestly... It means the world to me... sigh* 😒

Awww

The Scandinavian memes made me laugh and pewdiepie’s reaction made them all the more funny 😂
The scandinavian meme had me 😂😂

I got a Mortal Combat 11 add before the video started. Looks like Jared has a fight on his hands.
Like JonTron said: Even flex tape can't fix a broken marriage.
Woman cheats: Well, he probably mistreated her
Man cheats: He deserves his life and career to be destroyed!
The person he cheated with was also married. HmmmmMMMMM
4:12 UP*** ffs
Didn't his ex admitted asking about having an open relationship? That's an obvious red flag.

Disgraceful simply disgraceful.
So Jared "Projared" Knabenbauer cheated on his wife with Holly "Commander Holly" Conrad, i.e. Ross "RubberNinja" O'Donovan's (now) ex-wife?

Is YouTube turning into a soap opera?
I don't equte this with a 🤡 but rather a🍑 and🍄.
Tjop Kloömment! Fjürst!
Nicholas sonic: “Its simple guys!”

"Look i know some of us can just GO OFF all half COCKED and make ASSES of ourselves and i wouldnt want to be too HARD ON you but i just felt like i had a big ol' BONE to pick with you"

Hes just be shitting himself after a few weeks of contant hints like this.
Jared to his mirror: I'm about to end this dude's whole carreer

This video gets a bröèkén märrjágé out of 10
You know you messed up when you say the dog from up is from pets
"You know you messed up when DSP, out of all people, drags you on Twitter."

And DSP thinks he's being seen in a PAHSITIVE LIGHT.
I'm honestly disappointed, I used to see Projared as an influence, He got kicked out of Normal boots for this action, and i'm also disappointed in holly as well.
Projared and James Chairles: *Ending their own career

it's their own personal matter, who gives a shit HAHAHAH? he obviously shouldn't have cheated, he should've just separated or divorced from her, but we don't know what's happening behind closed doors and really it's their own thing to deal with - themselves

Happy marriage exists

How does ProJared rate vs DrDisrespect then?  Is ProJared done?
Really don’t think there’s “another side of the story” when someone cheats. ProJared cheated, so ProJared is wrong, the end

They really missed the opportunity in the dog meme - it should've said Björk Björk .
real gamers don't cheat on their wife because that would be spending time with someone when you could be gaming. REAL gamers don't cheat on their wife because they don't have a wife except in second life.

Scandinavian Pewdiepie:
Projared predicted his own downfall
Fricking fricks , fricks
I know this comment will be buried within the memes and jokes but I want to put out my thoughts on this situation. I had no idea that this happened 5 days after the controversy and now just finding out about it, it makes me very sad deep down because I thought his review videos were funny and enjoyable to watch and charming. His playthrough of Doki Doki LC was my favorite out of everyone's playthrough. I always thought he was an underrated gamer that deserves the recognition he deserves because of the content he puts out, especially when in my opinion, are better than some other reviewers out there. Now I feel lost and so confused and so heart broken that this happened and I'll never look at his videos the same way. Projared, you really fucked up and fucked all of us up with this. Sure we put out memes and whatever, but I bet deep down, especially the fans of his, I'm pretty sure we're all saddened and lost about this. Thanks for reading whoever did read.
The person Jared cheated with is actually Ross from Game Grumps ex-wife. The more you know

 Skrattar du förlorar du
people are actually dumb. fish need oxygen from the air. if the water doesn't have much oxygen in it, a fish is able to drown. drowning is the same as sufficating,

2016: no dont do it, im a virgin
2019: 2:58
You could drown a fish since the definition states “death caused by suffocation when water or other liquid fills the lungs” and I don’t think a fish could survive very long in a tank of oil or tar, so the guy isn’t stupid smh.
VIDEO I PAY 5000 TO FIX WE DONT NEED EDITS WE NEED LIGHTS :-]
Last video got the best quality video and now we're back at the worst quality video.

Felix: Ah s#!+, Here we go again.

yes, fish can drown. I heard sharks drown if you force them to not swim. sharks need to constantly swim else they cannot extract enough oxygen in the water.
and yes, sharks are fish.

Fish can drown, if they get stuck air doesnt get to their brain, bc there isnt enough circulated oxygen. But some would call that suffocation idk
I usually laugh at every meme but this time I didn’t. I think I’m depressed for real this time 😔💯
Perfectly cut screams are just jojos "To be continued" 

Change my mind
6:59 did anyone else think he was laughing ironically after he said “cut anything at the perfect time and it’s funny”
Great video -    PSA: Always buckle up

thank you kind soul that captioned this video.
Why am I getting notification for this video 2 days after it was uploaded
4:37 😅👌
Can confirm, fish are able to drown. Fish breathe the oxygen that's in the water -- that's why it's super important to have a bubbler system or elevated filter when keeping fish in order to keep oxygen flowing through the water! And if you're keeping any kind of fish in a bowl, don't forget to agitate the water every 2-3 days to incorporate oxygen along with regular water changing & conditioning to keep your fishies healthy!
- Love, Fish Dad
Make this Blue is you love watching Felix

Fish drown ‘cause they still take in the oxygen in the water, though their gills; so when there isn’t enough oxygen, they drown.

representing züürich whoooooop
if we have 12 fish and half of them drown.. then we assume that the other half did not drown meaning that they are not submerged in water thus they are dead ... so yes 6 are alive
Im lucky to be indian. All your new videos appear in the morning so i watch em with breakfast
Pewdiepie: uploads vid

Innovation that excites
The japanese werent about to surrender when the atomic bombs were dropped, and they didnt surrender afterwards because of it. They surrendered when the russians landed on their soil.
Brad: makes greatly edited pewds vids

Me: Well with that logic...

I know I killed someone, but it doesn’t count. I un-killed them.
can anyone give me a link to the robert downey scare video (at 4:40 )
6:22 But logically speaking he is right, 6 are left. He said IF they drown. Given that they did somehow drowned, 6 would be left. Just because reason is valid doesn't mean its conclusion is true, if the premises wouldn't work in real life.
Fish can actually drown for anyone who didn't believe that
Seguramente tendrías mas subscriptores si le pones subtítulos a tus vídeos
Remember when Jake Paul said "PewDiePie is Next" and they are still 77 plus million subs apart.

Don't mind my math if it's wrong
Japan was not about to surrender. Actually one general was going to attempt a attack when they actually did surrender.
Reality can be what ever I want it to be. Me
I thing that he should say to gain subs is

You need to add a sign like you see in dangerous factories "It's been [14] days since last PewDiePie controversy" on your background TV, and unironically keep it up to date.


Also, just behind the TV a "Hang in there" cat poster... lol
you uploaded this on mah moms bday OOF

You are also Brad2 sive1, so he was talking about you.
Congrats on 2 weeks streak of no controversy ! 🎉🎉🎉
Wait I just realise LWIAY = Last Week I Ask You 
Bbbbbut he didn't ask us anything
I like fluffy eggs and breakfast classics for just one dollar.
Me: Did you fix the video quality?
Pewds: Yes
Me: What did it cost?
Pewds: Everything
I 4give you Sive. You're already ignored as an editor as it is.

Brad! How much is T-Series paying you??
For every like i'll make a sit-up👍
Good work keep it going. I worked on youtube 2-3 years ago. It is cool
6:38 u gotta give mini lads credit for this idea bec he dose meme streams and came up with it
3:10 just realized that's his keyboard
Sive is the real hero for admitting his mistakes

Good man 👏👏👏
Day 1:  of asking Pewdiepie to play SpongeBob Nighty nightmare
Live-stream LWIAY?! Yes please!
Just get jacksepticeye's camera.... I really like his cam quality

Brad was not doing color correction because he didn't know what to do with VHS you was giving him.
Go sub to The Crazy Raccoon and like his new fortnite season 9 montage
The quality still looks bad for me lmao.
That last one was definitely "Pewdiepie will always be number one in communist hearts."
1080p @ 60fps On Pewd’s channel?

# WHEN DO WE TURN 10 YRS OLD

Pew die pie (like)
T series (comment)
way better quality this time thanks felix x
felix: stop the tall meme
also felix, referring to a picture of himself: wow what a great guy, i’m sure he’s also very tall
"Colour correction is not a skill"
~ Brad 2 (in his latest video)
It's actually not infinite. In the new versions of the game there is a world border. The world is a 60,000,000 x 60,000,000blocks box.


I know you didn't need to know that but now you do anyway
poppy horlow just looks so similar like me
WTF is she gay?
Well... P J Watson was correct... you are a hoot! Add my one to get 1 million.
The Minecraft world is flat.
Pewdiepie: Will pay $5000 to fix this


Media: He is making fun of blind people
when you have to go to class but the next pewdiepie vid isnt out yet :(
I like those picture messges MAKE MORE.
Good thing tuber sim has split screen feature now i can watch pewdiepie and play at the same time  (⊙.⊙(◉̃_᷅◉)⊙.⊙)
Did he really just pronounced it D I E
Brad cutting out memes from LWIAY is the internet equivalent of Stalin removing people from his photographs.
This is my final tall meme but I'm 6'3
Came from the T series meme, stayed for the content
Pıtırcık eller Youtube chanel is very very good😉👍
Felix: "I'm very smart."

Felix's Brain: "Am I joke to you?"
Mediocre Content?!? MY FAVORITE!
True bros still watch you in 144p
WHY DOES YOUTUBE TELL ME THAT 5 DAY OLD VIDEOS ARE "New"
"good thing I have 3001 IQ"
I a m r o p e
Now his video and audio quality are great just like his content
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
When I see a PdwDiePie video



MOM GET THE CAMERA!
THE AUDIO IS SO CRISP NOW THANK YOU
The new Sonic looks amazing!
I'm sorry that we're so invested in tearing down the video quality, it looks good now so I'm hoping everyone stops bugging you and the Brads 🤣
Why does it sound like John Lennon sings the intro
still 480p...
Why did you write title in Slovene???
please do a video of you photoshopping sonic
increases video quality
me with my crappy internet: what the FRICK is that even supposed to mean?
The first class service and support!!
Just liking the video for the Brad 2's message :D
144P = 4kP Super quality
7:22 felix doesn't have legs
where do you find the 3000 iq memes
When he said Matrix, I was somehow at the YMCA looking at a machine that said Matrix on it.
Can we get the intro of this video but with the green screen?
Can you play PUBG pew
I GOT A LETTER IN THE POST
(insert brad's resignation note here)
English (Auto-Generated) is weird :/
I never noticed any quality difference tbh
Sips back in pewdiepie again! With some Duncan too

how about felix edits one of his own vids
Someone: I made x should I send it to felix?
Felix: ye ok
Someone: GiVe mE YoUR ADdrEsS
The dynamics between Brad 1 and 2 deserves Noble Prize winning quality research and Attention
That intro deservs a like
i am this at 144p so wat the point again?
We need to go deeper in the bad video quality
That intro was so confusing...
I'm down for Livestream LWIAY
Live Pewdiepie , bro !!!

Amazing good 2019 eh!
Good lighting and video quality 
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
Fix camera and it will be 144p.

2:59 that incredible job reminded me of the congratulation song lol. I heard that one to many times😛😝 to many Ytbers reacting to it and I almost can remember the song out of my head like it keeps playing in my mind eventhough I'm not listening to the song

I know almost all of the memes in this ep, i wonder what that says about me🙃
I am genuinely sad pewdiepie wont be first to 100 million. T series having a plaque on their wall makes me feel so disappointed. But as long as we get there together, I guess it doesn’t matter who gets there first.

PewDiePie: "We did a Anki Overdrive promo that day"
Me: *immedietly gets sad because anki is shutting down*
T bots you using bots pls and win vs t series
People like you could fix many election problems by hosting a live stream election with all the people that the dems and repubs and corporate tv stations won't allow to have a voice. Please pewdiepie help the people to find a people's candidate debate to go viral
Say bad quality:

Phone battery: 100%


Presses 1080p60 on phone

Phone battery: - 💯
You should do more of those old photoshop videos. They were super funny
2 ads in one ad interruption? Is this new?
7:44 Pewdiepie, Sips & Duncan did something together. That's pretty cool.
We need to get to 100,000,000 before T-Series
Pewdiepie: uploads vid 
5 seconds later...
500,000k views
Now my question is, 








Does this "brad" really exist?
Peter McKinnon needs to give you a makeover lol
I put it at 144p to make this feel like a regular video
Nie robisz niec k*rwa a tyle sub?! xD nie będę tłumaczyła sam sobie tłumacz

60FPSS!!!
Guys just wanted to ask. Is there any other person on the planet that makes these types of videos. Coz This is GOLD!
The  question is, will he use 5000$ to fix his camera...
Or his editors?
At this point, SEGA and Sonic Team should just make new Sonic games based on memes. Fans seem to love it when official Sonic The Hedgehog gets self aware.
better quality?
LIVE LWIAY PogChamp
So when are we getting Sammy Zenith on meme review
Pewdiepie: Has bad quality
Media: are you making fun of people with good quality?
Zylbrad, could you please stop stealing ToddyQuest's content? I dont even remember u thanking him for his shoutouts
LWIAY Livestream guys? Who Agrees???

Pewds: *agreees with anti-brad-1-and-2 memes, telling them not to take things out*
Brad doesn’t listen
Also pewds: “edit this one out, brad.”
Brad doesn’t listen.

Pewds made a video saying he would give $5000 to someone for editing his videos better....
Just a day before...
Sive made a video giving people from fiverr money to fix his videos...

COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT...

KNOWLEDGE
I think he got confused between Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Unlike Brie, Olsen is liked by all the fans and is a really cool person.
Honestly.. seems about the same?
Who is will? Why does he have to pay 5000$ to fix this?
Your the best and t series is a loser

Welp Brad lost his career

Pewdiepie

(See how may likes I get for just saying this)
Don’t give up on the war
I love the extra cutscene after he says "Bye" 😂
As a 21 year old nine year old I approve of this video.
Sonic + Sonny = Isonic instead of ironic get it? I’m so lonely.
Why does pewd's video still looks bad 😂
Кто с Вани ставьте лайк
Colour correction.

Is Brad from India or what ? -,-
Scarlet witch
Poor Brad. sive 1 was making the mistakes and we all roast Brad 😂
Hey ! that fanart is amazing at 3:06, anyone knows where I can find it ?
The way pewds sometimes speaks broken English makes him way more funnier.

Cancer for my eyes.

I want the next theme for the next Lwiay be about Marvel Memes so Felix will be forced to watch MCU movies to understand these scenes and forcing him to become invested in it, ultimately turning him into a Marvel Fan
Love you bro ❤️

Big fan from Pakistan 😘😘
Now I've been a 9 year old for many years now, and I've stuck by Felix through thick and thin, but I will NOT stand for that slander on my girl Scarlet Witch. "Least interesting character"? I don't fuckin' think so
No felix your the broken but of the joke!
its gettin toasty in here
What does lwaiy stand for?
most controversial thing felix has every done? insult scarlet witch 💔
You can tell the latest post is the most liked
JoJo colour scheme 5:50
Do you dye your hair or is naturally blond?
The sun doesn’t “get around the world” the world spins. And to get the miles an hour the world spins, you must calculate its size and how short the days are, and since Minecraft days are 10 minutes, and the world is infinite, I conclude that the Minecraft world is spinning at insane speeds at infinite miles per hour.

1:33 i respect you sive

WONDERFUL VIDEO
Felix my brudah said phew phew die die pie pie
Honestly agree with that take everyone is making tati to look like a hero in all this when she is just as sleazy and out for herself as James Charles is. She is right money and fame do change you clearly it made her into a complete sleazy shill who will out friends just for  not supporting her brand. Seems like a shady tactic to me. James needs to stop his straight man turning shit before he messes with the wrong one and gets beaten or worse. But tati just need to keep her mouth shut. She doing it for the clout nothing more.
Hey Sammy Zenith accepted to host meme review. GET HIM ON!

Hi

Just came back to this video and what’s that mark on the side of your neck?
Okay, now I'm really confused. Who is sive 1? Is it Brad 1 or Brad 2, cause sieve is Brad 2... does that make Brad 1 sive 1, which again may or may not be possible   because Brad 1 isn't Brad 2, and there's a slight chance of Brad 2  being Sive 2.... Right?....Right?
In Brad 2's recent video he said that color correction was easy and required no skill. WHAT THE FRICK BRAD 2!
10:45 media: pewdiepie laughs at fanart with hidden death to all jews content
2:48 whats that music?

Little kid: what are you doing to further improve the mobs

Panel: No
Pewds gets better video quality

Did you do it?
Yes
What did it cost?
Wow. Apparently playing Minecraft destroys your ability to pronounce Rs?
This video is just awkward children asking questions to awkward adults
Dan handled it much better with the kids than Jordan.
kid: "can you sign this?"
panelists: "that's your question?"

Someone: Okay when will mojang do 2019 minecon?
Mojang: Yes
The silence in the room when the panelists don't answer the questions immediately is deafening
I guess all the rules are out the window now. We just do Cringe Tuesday on a Wednesday now like a bunch of savages.
3:38 when you try to make friends the first day of school
fun fact: superkai64 is a real profile, and he still wears his minecon 2013 cape
When normal people think of Minecon: Wow, I love Minecraft! I wonder what cool and unique builds will be shown off this year!

When I think of Minecon: D E T I T A T E D  W A A Y U M

PewDiePie
And this is why good panels screen their questions
Cringe Tuesdays: Exists
Wednesday: I'm about to end this man's whole career
I LOVE CRINGE TUESDAYS
I feel so bad for the kids because the panelists don't understand what they're saying for some reason- It's usually just a MINOR lisp... For example the kids who couldn't say "R" and it came out as "W"- It should be really easy for the panelists to understand what they're saying but for some reason they can't...
14:12 i thought he said can you kiss my arse lmao
My favorite block is diamond
If you made it to the end congrats...




You are now 15% stronger

Superkai64 vs. Noobmaster69

Now that's an epic gamer battle I'll for sure pay to see
GUYS IT'S WAMBO
The one where the little squeaky kid asks if he wants to come to his house and he responds with he'll come if he makes tea, that was handled so much better than many of the other ones. The kid was probably just really nervous and excited to get to talk to his online video buddy and all it took was just giving a nice little response and entertaining the kid just for a second, that probably made the kid really happy.
12:39  switch on subs XD
5:59 makes me think it's the moment when Felix's ball expands 4 times the size of the other one, he's lived with the effect ever since
kid: uH dO yOu WaNnA cOmE tO mY hOuSe
dan: y e s
Nice vetements crewneck

''There were two cracks in my ass, that's one too many.''


that sentence literally broke me

“They sent me off with a broken ass” I LOST IT LMAO

My family is silently watching a movie and I'm sitting in the corner laughing and cant stop
i remember felix talking about the sailing story in his outlast 2 videos
He protecc

And most important,
He broke his ass
The story of how Pewdiepie lost his legs. Touching.
let's all thank jonas for this, because we wouldn't have saladASS2 if this didn't happen.                                              Thank you Jonas, very cool!
when they say to use your imagination
"You break an ass, nobody thinks that's cool"
No, Felix, now almost 600k people thought that is cool. Cool story.
who immediately thought of friends the tv series XD
As far as I'm concerned, that's Youtube's Ass.
ant-man salute
Thought this was gonna be about animal super squad...
Davie504: I broke my "BASS"

I would want to see someone fighting someone with broken ass. I wonder how would the kicks look
Pewdiepie: did you post it
Also pewdiepie: yes
Pewdiepie and what did it cost
Also pewdiepie: my dignity
When your sibling hits you in public: ow, jereddddd

I HAVE TEARS COMING OUT OF MY EYES HAHAHAHAHA, THIS IS SUCH GOLD, I LOVE IT
This video is over 10 minutes.

Ok.
LIS [LAUGH IN silence)
1st video i have watched from you. wowza.
PewDiePie found a way to match his audio quality to his video quality.
This video deeply reflects the ontological statement of PewDiePie himself. The video seems oddly mechanical on PewDiePie’s part. Shitposty nature and atmosphere as a whole. Looks a lot like lazy last minute
“story mode” posting. The concept of cracking one’s ass seems bizarre and dreamt up. A lot like lazy view thirsty clickbait. That video made me feel like I was in the matrix, thus the ontological mumbo jumbo at the beginning. Props to you, Pewds.
 Edit: 
 I’m considering a job as a professional YouTube video critic and I need some practice.
how's here after the i broke my balls video?
I actually think the funniest part is when he drugged himself for no reason lmao
Kicimi kirdim??? Sen turce nerden bilion!!!
He protecc 
He attacc
But most importantly, 
His ass got extra cracc
Damn it i don’t remember the last time I laughed this hard
Yup I have a lump of scar tissue with nerve damage and I call it my third butt cheek
I'm deeply sorry for laughing at this.. xD
"There was a crack in my ass" that just made me cry laughing lmao
Kid : I broke my arm
Other kid: I broke my leg
Felix: I bRoKe mY aSS
im 13 years old, allmost 14 and ive never broken anything in my whole life'
Felix, I'm so sorry you had to go through that kind of suffering! ; Π ;
I’m so sorry 😐 butt it’s so funny 🤣
So inspirational, you will get through this baby girl, you have my prayers 💓🙏🏼 thank you for sharing
This explains it all.....THeY hAd To aMpuTatE hIs BoTtoM HalF, including his legs
thank you for looking out for us. may no bro break his ass on pewds watch. 😂
Someone could have "I signed the crack"
You are my soul mate!!!  I just watched my first Pewdie Pie video yesterday and today I followed up with 5 more.  You got me. Subscribed!  I love what you are doing.  It’s awesome and if you ever want to break my ass?.....lol
turn on subtitles, lmaooo... ha
9:26
"You break an arm, its cool, 
You break an ass, its not cool"

I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂😂😂
Русские поставьте лайк,чтобы американцы подумали что я

SÓ BRASILEIRO VAI ENTENDER ISSO 😂
Balence on one leg 
I thought you had no legs
The final fantasy tactics death sound when he was talking about balance was the icing on this video. I love that game. Got it on my phone now!
I get it he's running out of ideas so he's starting this "I broke my *Blank*" videos.
As far as I'm concerned, that's Youtube's Ass.
ant-man salute
this is the best video ever haha
Mano alguém podia dublar o canal do piwdiepie
B O R I N G

It’s a good thing that you have a $399.99 chair to keep you comfortable
Don't worry Felix!
I broke my ass on the 12th of May
Wait... is a youtube bug or the tittle is "Eu parti o meu cu"?
Que? Como assim... o titulo ja é em português e falando EU PARTI MEU CU
"I basically just drugged myself as hard as I could"
Quality video but shitty mic quality 
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
I guess we ran out of 9 year olds

I thought you meant you were Gay at first. I almost unsubscribed, so I'm glad you aren't.
Idk who captions his videos but they are amazing
My name is Tammy Seltzer. 
My oldest sister is Rosie. Rosie is 23 and autistic. 
My second oldest sibling is Donny. Donny is 20 and is also autistic. 
My third oldest sibling is Naomi. Naomi is 19 and she has Buerger Disease. (which causes blood vessels to swell and prevent blood flow). 
My fourth oldest sibling is Rebecca. Rebecca is 17, but was diagnosed with cancer when she was 14. 
Then there is me, I do not have anything. 
My younger brother Alex who is 12 does not have anything either. 
Yes I have a big family and the fact that Alex and I didn’t inherit any diseases is something I still to do this day cannot believe and I know what I’m saying doesn’t totally relate to this video but when I first saw the title my first reaction was that Felix had some sort of disability down there...
(😂) 
Anyway I just wanted EVERYONE to know how lucky and special they are!!💕
this is my new favorite video on the internet
Pewdiepie : I broke my ass

Thanos : First time ?
When you forget the the theater seats fold up and you sit down
My ankle might me broken. Twisted it when I fell when riding my bike.
Edit: it is broken
7:30 LOL DED DED
I broke my ass years ago, I don't even remember how.  I couldn't sit in certain chairs without extreme discomfort for years.  I was starting to feel better before a flight to Japan but was worried I'd re-break myself just by sitting so long.  But it sure would be an embarrassing hassle to bring a special cushion.  It's a lonely pain.  But I can think of more lonely ones, too.
Man he's really taking the cringe Tuesday thing seriously.
Next he going to do I broke my b**bs
Fans: he must have gone out of ideas.


Pewdiepie: hold my beer
I laughed so hard and everyone is asleep goddamn it i’m gonna get my ass whipped and broken by my parents 😭😭💔
I shattered my tailbone in 4 places😂😂I know the pain ma dude
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Not even Ricardo Milos:
PewDiePie:
Kkkkk como assim eu parti o meu cu kkk
Thank god for this incredible audio quality.
Once I broke my ass too...
It was bad, I couldn't sit down properly for weeks and worst of all I had horse camp a few weeks later, you can imagine what THAT was like. Mine was on the other hand because my dad decided to kick me in the back and he managed to break my coccyx bone. :')

I'm enjoying this video more than I should be
I thought this was gonna be his coming out story
I didn't knew that it was possible to laugh for 11 mins straight
And then his legs fell off. 
It all makes sense now.
That’s why he owns such a comfortable chair.
Sorry for the schadefreude, but I laughed so hard 😂😂
8:25 From this point on I started rofling.
I am a sailing instructor working in the Mersey, Liverpool, England

I broke my tailbone lol ur not alone
He protecc

But most importantly
I always felt that same way when I was a kid. All my friends had broken something and were regarded as "cool" because they had. Now I'm 28 and to this day I've never broken anything. 

idk, maybe I'm just lucky lol

Start a meme about his balance 😆
I don't understand. What part of his ass got broken? He would've gotten stitches if skin got torn, right? Did he break his tailbone? That's not that embarrassing, is it?

But most importantly

I feel so bad for laughing felix really seemed embarassed more than his ball video
no one:
felix:  nEvErTheLeSs
And thus concludes the story of how Felix gained his third ass cheek
Bet it was promethazine thay gave him, a larger dose of antihistamine acts like a sedative
Your Idol might tell you to listen to your mom and to not do drugs.

My Idol told me not to break my aSS

Weird flex but ok
Papa need some watch time :))))) Great
I broke my ass aswell 
One day I was at my friends house and we were both active kids and we were doing flips on his trampoline I was doing good but then I did one flip that I somehow did wrong and my ass landed on a 1m by 1m massive pot plant... Goddamn it hurt so much, my ass was literally black from  bruises after that, it was not nice.
Wait what was actually broken? His tail bone?
We need a animated story about this! Hit like if you want too..
7:33
thanks Felix I won’t brake my ass now
I’ve been a sailing instructor for kids before when I was 16 & 17. I get what he means about lashing out at the bad kids haha 😂
Turn on captions..
felix never learned the word 
'tailbone'
8:41
Im speechless
You made this video a couple months too early... I somehow broke my tailbone and I looked up how to fix a broken tailbone and do you know what it said??
It said to not sit for long periods of time and not walk and stuff. IF I CAN'T SIT OR WALK HOW AM I MEANT TO DO SCHOOL?


Anyways, it was broken for like 3 months (thank god for school holidays) those two weeks off really helped my ass lol
If You Want to be the best youtuber i think you should make another music video?! it may help you or not because T-SERIES IS USING BOTS
Thats sad , i broke mine eye..
he fixed his image quality, now the problem is his mic.








Ok it doesnt really matter.
JAJSJSJAJAJS ES EL 1

Czy on serio nazwał filmik po polsku ??
This is one of your better videos recently even though its simple. I'd love to hear more stories about your life if you're willing to share them!
Once a great sailor said, "It really hurts to break your ass"
Como assim vc partiu seu cu kkkkkkkk
FYI , in french "Je me suis cassé le cul"  is closer to "I busted my ass" as in I worked really hard on something
😂🙂😂😂😂🤣😂
Well i did too😂😂😂😂😂
This is actually my favourite PewDiePie video as, when it comes to comedic storytelling, this is golden.
His cheeks were clapped 👏👏
Do you tubers do their own captions
quite frankly swedes are accident and illness prone like chubby house cats..
What is the song in the background while he tells the story
He should do more of these story telling vids. This was entertaining AF.
This title got me laughing too hard
this vid is so dopeeeeeeeee
Polski tytuł bez polskich napisów szkoda ☹️
I honestly can’t tell whether or not he’s being more-so humorous with this story, or if he’s trying to get a genuine message across and be serious 😂😂
Cuendo lo veo es me rompi mi trasero entro me rmpi el culo xd
These are the kinds of story times that I signed up for in YouTube

Lowkey it kills stay strong pewds
Your audio is he best
But did you dieeee?
You used to have a job at a hotdog stand
I was waiting for the joke reveal... but this is actually not ironic.
Like si el titulo estaba en Español
What a sad story :"<
FYI do NOT ever take more than the suggested dosage of those travel tabs, ESPECIALLY near water, because if you don't fall asleep you will hallucinate like CRAZY. Scopolamine drugs will mess you up. Never mind breaking his ass, he's lucky he didn't fucking drown.

“I broke my ass”
Ladies and gentlemen Ant Man got him
At least he didn’t break his ba-
Tu partiu oq?
My mom broke her butt when she was a teenager after she tried jumping into a river and landed on a rock instead. Then, instead of telling anyone that she was in extreme pain and needed help, she decided to just walk it off. She never even knew that she broke her butt and was in pain for months. Years later when she was an adult she had an x-ray and the doctor saw that her butt bone had been broken. Luckily it was healed by then and my mom was fine.
Good job trying to pass 10min just sitting down and telling the story pewds. Amazing
PewDiePie: I broke my as

Thanos: Ant-Man broke mine
А почему на русском название?

As someone battling brain cancer every day, your videos keep me going and put asmileon my face. Thank you for your hard work. Keepitup and I will keep fighting.
When Felix started talking about motion sickness i felt bad because I used to have motion sickness but then being forced into roadtrips and boats for my entire childhood seemed to make it stop 
And I mean like 6 or more road trips per year and usually like 4 or 5 boat trips. since they didnt want to deal with me so i became someone else's problem for a few months
I know it could be funny for all the people is watching you, butt( ok no ) but I can feel your pain
Quote Of The Year
"There were two cracks in my ass , that's one to many"

-Felix Kjellberg
There is no logical form of matter to transend the elemental formulary to the scientific facts that are and forever will be wrong.  Try explaing that to orca.
You should have had Jaiden animate this story or you could have her make an animated version and upload it
then how are you sitting down?
LUL this was good
When pewdiepies new editor is funnier than brad 2
I just bruised my tailbone a few days ago

You could say, with this experience, he hit rock bottom.
Por que o meu título tá em português?
I didn’t want this to be real ....but I really did
I literally broke my ass as a 9 year old. Sitting on the bike frame while someone else was riding and we went into a small but deep hole in the road. My tailbone broke and I still have occasional pain 16 years later

Therefore we conclude that pewdiepie is not T H I C C
if you speak Spanish
This is hilarious
I  felt bad😭😭
No logic channel
This man just spoke for a whole 11 minutes on how he broke his ass. Never ceases to amaze me.
"Dupa mi pękła"
Buy a horse they are much more better
Felix: bad word
Captain America: I’m proud of you young buck
Me: Aw shitte, here we go again
Well we all have that one friend whos like jonas
I thought this was going to be about him breaking the game he made

A.S.S
You should get people to animate these and do animation storytimes. Maybe do it once or twice a month?
😂🤣
Anyone else picture him being held up on a crane over a hospital bed with his ass up ... I was waiting for that picture to go on screen. Such disappointment when he was just sent home with painkillers 😂
Best comedian
can't wait for the animated version of this
You can do it...
Czy mi się wydaje czy PewDiePew napisał po Polsku!!!!!!!????

Butthurt!

the thumbnail of this video is in my recommendations since the video is out...it just stays thre forever...

by now the image is burned in my head so deeply that i don't know how the real remake sonic even looked like..which is kinda a good thing i guess
The El Dorado meme made me happy
Pewds: upgrades camera quality

I heard Sega is getting Chris Chan for the redesign
Editor: How much do you want the saturation to be?
PewDiePie: Yes.
Cara você tem 90m e 90k de inscritos e ganha 300k indo pra 400k isso e tudo fã modinha
No one:

Pewdiepie: Can you feel the sunshine?

Also Pewdiepie: 

Pewdiebooty: 
1997: Can you feel the sunshine?

2019: No.
Man sonic the hedgehog and sonic adventure were probably the best games he made
PewDiePie: finally makes a good quality camera

Brad: "bring up the saturation!"
Don't judge a book by it's cover and I'm talking about sonic he's not a cartoon he's realistic
The saturation hurts my eyes and my heart.

You thought Sonic was bad? Wait until they reveal Tails.

I thought the same thing when I first saw the trailer


Did anyone else notice?
The dispenser guy from Team Fortress.


It’s the engineer, you simpleton.



Pewdiepie I still love you please notice me senpi
I play tuber simulator.
Be proud of me

The hindi thingy in 9:03 says "mera astitva kya hai" which basically means "why is my existence" or "Why do I exist"
Astitva is a word i knew the english spelling of but never even use, and hence, didn't understand the meaning. God, I haven't even touched the Hindi/Sanskrit script since I was like 11.
I'm kind of mad that Sonic got the rights to Gangster's Paradise but JoJo season 5 couldn't
Pewds - Make Me Hot In The Video

I got a add on PewDiePie Tuber simulator on a PewDiePie video and the ad said take him out.

Coincidence I think not!
PewDiePie wants to die.
PEW=RUSSIA IN THE ПЭВ
DIE  This word means to die, but the hands of Felix will not die because he works wonders, content and kindness all over the world, including the USA and Russia, we love you. And yes, I translated the text through Google translator. I don’t know English 


PIE= PIE  This means a pie, I know that Felix loves pies as well as all of us don’t support him and I like a koment I tried to translate from Russian into English, and yes I love you and yes I am from Russia


and now Felix and all Englishmen translate this text into Russian and listen to all
Now connect these meanings and what your answer will come out write in comments I will read and translate :) and yes, who re

"Haven't made a decent game in 3 decades" Someone here haven't played Fortnite lol
Pewds : Fixed the video quality
Lighting : Am I a joke to you?
Audio : Am I also a joke to you?
The fact that he wore Cloakbrand while advertising his Tuber Simulator touched my heart ;;u;; <3 (but yes, i love Tuber Simulator, you should go play it... like right now.. especially you nocturnal hoomans)

I have a very strong urge to sub to T-series after you said all these disrespectful comments about sonic.
Wait everyone, does this shade look highly orange to me? or is it just you.

Let’s just say, Brian David Gilbert was funnier, even though he was going over the Sonic bible instead.

I can understand why they went for a more realistic hedgehog look, since a classic cartoon Sonic doesn't really fit in tbh.
The pewdiepie tuber simulater is a really fun game, I give it a 5/5 rating.

Why does the new sonic look like Jacob Sartorius?

This is some art
Every Sonic Mania review: "Sonic has had a rough transition to 3D..."
i will never understand how they thought making a movie about Sonic before he had a good title under his belt was a good plan, like, its a video game character, so, why would you attempt to cross mediums when you havent even found success in the first one?

Nintendo owns sonic because Sega went bankrupt. You'd think they'd get some better quality after getting new owners from their own failure. Can't lie though, the bad games are the best ones because the glitches are hilarious.

They made sonic such a monstrosity so that people forgets about the genie. Hmm.....
who goes to the treding tab to find things to watch anyways? that place is just a cringe cesspool.
what if you abuse by posting stuff people dont wanna watch and then post high demand videos
This was a great quality video :P
Ok but GMM is on trending almost every day?

“That’s amazing”

I don’t think that’s right.
If you upload regularly you have more chance that one of your videos gets a peak in comparison with the rest of your videos,
Making the chance to get on trending higher

Props to him for complying with the officers and not making a scene (I mean, he filmed it so thats debatable by definition). Plenty of people will resist arrest and so it gets violent and then they blame the cops like boi just comply and settle it later.
Sonnic not die :> <3

the subs are wrong. he said ohayou.. that is good morning not good evening ....eeeeee

OMG! I've waited for so long! Pew news, my favourite show of all time
They should just rename the Trending tab to the "Sponsored" tab, and then add an actual trending page. That way everyone gets what they want.




Edit: People are saying that no one would click on the Sponsored tab. What if the sponsored tab was also listed above the recommended tab on the home page so that it would be seen more? I don't think anyone would mind since it's basically just another subtle advertisement.
6:25 discord notifications drove me crazy
@adam22 or @nojumper is probably like why does pewdiepie not watch us what do we do now
Awesome & amazing video for this  channel and on the best.
Better camera quality but worse lighting
This is the quality original content that I came for. News from a Swedish man living in England speaking Japanese. Perfect.
Etika: I went I became god I got out
Im uncomfortable with this quality camera

Babe your videos basically are trending, because everyone is watching them all the time. I also think trending is what's going on not just on YouTube but the same things being talked about at the same time on Facebook, Twitter and so on that gets things like your saying trending. But no worry's everyone that truly loves you knows your trending hot as hell. Love you babe 💘😍😘
The filter on Felix's camera is...

Kind of liked the intro lol lighting was greeeaaatttt
It's a nice theory to say that not putting you on trending leaves spots for other people, but what about GMM, Binging with Babish, Mr. Beast, etc. I like all the channels just fine, but it seems like a valid counterargument. IDK though
You know what Felix?? Your a goofy guy... But you have a lot of good perspectives on things kudos my guy!!!

3:18 
The frickening 2.0 is coming
Bruh I legit clapped when he said 'no pewdiepie oopsie' smh that's when you know things are bad
So..Speaking of sonic, how is your friend DARKEEDGEBLOODSWORD doing?
02:43 I think that a lot of people realized it too. It's incredible stupid, and appears that won't be explained (well, it's so bad that I don't really know if I want it explained, tho).
Go to 0:24 with captions on
Gotta go fast
Finally some positive news about YouTube
Kids got their YouTube kids app
We need a YouTube Adults app
That way people can swear all they want
Criticizing someone without swearing is very hard and some people think the person criticizing is just sugar coating his insults

Edit 01
For the people saying that platform would be just like any porn site Not at all
It would be like Reddit and Wikipedia  made for Uploading videos but with the monitization elements included
日本語だw
You are my GOD
12:20 idk about that, I see people on trending all the time pewds. Tfue someone I love to watch gets on there every time he uploads and gets about the same views every time.

If it was a full time commitment they were thinking of, then they would have made sonic right the first time around. you wouldn't get this from any other guy. i just want to tell you how i'm feeling.
Felix can we get more book reviews I love them ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do one thing: start the video, and tap on the left side to rewind 10 seconds. If you repeatedly tap on it, you will get to hear a secret!

Sammy to host meme review
6:00 montagne
Honestly think that streamer guy is just a big troll
Felix started speak Japanese
Me:Surprised pikachu face
i put on subtitles and when he says "good evening fellow gamers" it actually says "good morning"
What happend to this guy, he’s starting to look like a normal swedish guy
You should talk about octoboy he lost monetization on his channel for re uploading content but he didn't re-upload anything and he's a really good editor and original person over all
7:31 the super smash meme. im dying
The fricc kid tried to warn us but we ignored him
Even with that understandable trending tab explaination. I think your Youtube rewind should have made it on the trending tab.
Etika :,(
Somehow I was unsubscribed from you.
I hope to get 100M subscriber and win against that t series 
it is the favorite of them
Pewdiepie: HE DID A OOPSIE

I have a tv with YouTube already installed and the trending tab is called Latest

Companies pay to be on trending. It’s a source of revenue for YouTube there’s no way it isn’t.
Wrong subs at the begging lol
"we're here for you, however we can, you have no idea"
just lack of awareness, surroundings, on camera admitting that youtube boosts subs & trend status for whomever they want, likely for a fee, & we knew this, all charts can be bought, but when you hear the head exec say this to an artist, its like..its not about the art, or what the fans want..pay us, & we'll boost you ahead of your competition. & that's fvckd up. what's the point of view #, sub count, trending chart, if it can be bought, or just a favoritism boost. American business is so dishonest.
whats the song playing at the end
#dreamycreamykeemy let's make it as relevant as tuber simulator
8:27 I legit thought he said, "Susan Wojincki talking to Jews world" then I saw the clip to see it was Juice Wrld.
8:11, wish I had a shout out like that...
finally I've been waiting for my dose of news
6:17 what is up drama lert nation!
YouTube Tr ending ash
i honestly didnt care about the camera quality

bUT THE LIGHTING I-
I'm glad that you saw the Susan clip for what it probably is, and not some evil conspiracy. People were acting so neurotic about it that I really tried to figure out what I could possibly be missing. XD In my experience, that's just how people at industry parties talk. I don't think she was being filmed clandestinely-- or, more to the point, I don't think she said anything that she wouldn't have said otherwise. Some people honestly thought she was offering to artificially inflate his stats. If anything-- strong "if"-- maybe she was priming him for a paid promotion somewhere down the line.
Best. Intro. Ever.
😔🖑 | trailer
    😏  | teaser
guys we knew it... Sammy's prediction was right we should have just left sonic alone

Susan sounded like she was joking
people are starting to scream so early
He’s a good boi
Is it just me or Felix has dark eye circles in this vid? Take care of yourself and rest well ❤
Now you are ingnoring T series
When you fix your quality
But the lighting thinks otherwise
atsui deskuka
i like this youtube is talking to us and thats all i wanted
Was really hoping popie would do the whole news segment in Japanese
Obligatory lighting comment here
This should be on news trending. YouTube is literally unwatchable as usual.
tony dies in endgame XD
trending exposed! no. 1 on trending
play more magic the gathering arena
These videos are getting sillier and sillier
It's such a relief that Susan is trying to help original creators on YouTube. 
Disliking YouTube Rewind 2018 was such a good move.
draw my life you
6:48 captions on
i am getting help with my mental health!
the sonic trailer looks like it was made on scratch
Pewdiepie: Uses a toaster for his camera and lighting

Also Pewdiepie: Pays a graphics crew to edit legs into all his videos including his “legs”
Pewds:Got a better camera

Fans:The lighting makes the cam poor
7:31 what was that
My name is poopie and welcome to poo news
The big australian fortnite youtubers(lachlan,muselk,lazarbeam) are always on trending for me
Pewdiepie: has awful camera quality

Also pewdiepie: can afford a special effects team to create fake legs.
Ugh I keep on getting ads what has this platform become! We need another adpocalypse!1!1!1!1!
Who tf is Juice Wrld?
Better than duolingo
6:20 DISCORD PINGS REEEEEE
I fell like watching the matrix with that new color-correction
Sammy predicted the end
Hey pew. Who r u??? R u ok??? R u doing fine???
Sonic ultraoooops
Amy Rose is cooler. She's my favorite character in the Sonic Universe! Amy fan for life!
So what happened when they took you to the mental hospital?


Ummm... They took me there, I became God
Trending should be thrown away
1:51 Gonna be blunt, that sonic sucked.
The discord sounds jesus
Is there be ads on video whhhhhhhhat
I miss the "This game is still relevant goddammit" outro
New challenge: can we hit #4 trending
1:38 Is This right trailer for sure Pewds?
Ahhh,My Eyes!!!Big Oof
I’m so rarted! I thought juice world was like a juice company or something, had no clue it was an artist and I was like ‘what’s wrong with a juice company?’

You fricken fricks, stop hating on sonic
Woah, Pewds speaking naruto

High hopes Molly
I like how fair your analysis is.
What happened to the Pew News background?
YouTube: exposed

Camera: fixed

Hotel: trivago
she lied kimmel is always on trending
@mumbo jumbo you got a shoutout lol
1:37 look like the creators of Momo redesigned Sonic the Hedgehog
James Charles is always in trendong though. Youtube just hates you.
Love the Side comments in the captions
I just don’t understand why congratulations was never on trending but literally all of like Liza koshy’s or jaiden animations videos are. The view counts generally are all near each other on those yet they all seem to get up. Feels like they go through YouTube and pick the videos they want for trending and bam creators they don’t like and handpick the trending tab instead of the algorithm actually getting the videos that are trending. I feel like there might not even be a trending algorithm at this point it just feels too fake to me.
I wonder if pewds is just making the quality bad cuz of the memes
Lol youtube took the vid Down
Then why the hell is James Charles on the trending page so many times
5:19 Haha!
Is that artist's name pronounced "Juice World" or "Jews World"? I'm really confused here...
aRRoW To tHe kNEe ?
Pewdiepie: YouTube trend exposed 
YouTube : DEMONETIZED
Camera quality is perfect
Lighting: Am i a joke to you

Sonic is dead and we killed him
no one: 

Pewds: What! You've never played TuberSimulator ppfftttt
Good mythical morning uploads 6 times a week and average the Adams amount of views yet always on trending every video basically
7:31 Why was that there?
4:39 the 2nd one would be good
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS! ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️
Look at Felix sticking up for Susan’s credibility even though Susan most likely would not return the favor. Class act.

Anything before the word BUt is BuLlSHiT
Regarding what he said about the trending tab; if an up-loader putting out a video that does better than their other videos is what it takes to get into trending, why am I always seeing the same channels on there? (Late show hosts, shane dawson, linus tech tips, mark-ass brownlie, etc)
She was drunk. Wow
Petition for PewDiePie to make the TV screen into an oopsie counter:

___ DAYS WITHOUT AN OOPSIE
That actually explains why I see people like Jonathan Tronstar and Idubbbbzz on trending despite all of the spice they have associated with them.
I like when you speak your mind
Watch as the media picks on what Felix said about Iggy:

12:00 James Charles is always on trending, no matter how many relative views he gets
Your explanation for the content that is on the trending tab would make a lot of sense, buuuuuttt every single time a fortnite youtuber uploads a video it gets on the trending tab. Look at lazarbeam, lachlan, and muselk
felix: ohayo gozaimasu
subtitles: good evening
duolingo: loOKS LIKE SOMEONE FORGOT THEIR DAILY PRACTICE
(((Juice Wrld)))
is it just me or is pews phone buzzing around 9:25? listen carefully
YouTube manipulates trending.  Why are you shilling for them?  They drop conservative creators like Mark Dice down hundreds of spots.  You can literally search for one of his videos by name and you'll get fake news sites like MSNBC and CNN instead, even though his videos have ten times the views.
One of the best YouTuber of mexico represent sonic in the film.LUISITO COMUNICA
Guys, I honestly think that Etika is too far gone.

Gentlemen... we lost him.
You gone mental
I have to say, it's refreshing to see ads on pewds' videos.
Lol He Became Japanese :D
子にちょわ
Anybody wanna talk about young felix in the thumbnail?
Im surprised etika made the news
wait what did i miss here, he's gone and done another oopsie and i missed it ?
5:36 - yes, undyne from undertale, absolute and complete nonsense.
Anybody else notice James Charles and Shane Dawson??
Played this video originally in 360p. Changed resolution to 1080p and... found no difference.
1:36 - 1:39 hilarious
What happened with the lighting?
i watched a 5 and half minute ad so you can get that bread🤝
When someone in entertainment screws up, especially during a time where once respected media outlets are clawing for scrutiny, I can understand that the fall a creator on YouTube would take would be harder than it would have been normally. The best course of action would be to act the best you can and produce good videos.
"My name is Poopie"




 Deep and sublime 9-year-old humour.
All hail pewds! The king of creators!

Of course YT trending is rigged. I never believe the crap that it's the algorithm at work, I'm pretty sure it some dude helping certain people.

He attac

But most importantly

He brought quality content bacc
The video doesnt come to trend because they watch it in different countries
Is that Swedish at the start?
6:40 his hair and beard are the same flipped
Wait then how do companies like marvel, who always get millions upon millions of views are always trending
He Protecc 
He Attacc


But most importantly 


The PewNews is bacc
4 mil views in 24hours:


YouTube: who is pewdiepie
go bacc to old cam
5:33 you are an embarrassment to our kind, we are ashamed that you portray us like that.
Has anyone else noticed the giant gleam of white light reflecting off his head because once you see it you can' stop seeing it
Felix: is smart
Media: are you making fun of us?!?!
Tails. Omg lol
Sounds like CNN -_-
While I think YouTube prioritizes it's channels for established stars over creators, I doubt Susan would actually rigg it so that anyone just gets basicallt cheatcodes to high subs. At best, maybe a good word or promotion.
0:41 that cracked me up
Pew: Shows us finally a sonic trailer.
Me: seems legit.
Pew: we have news that this is fake
Me: UwU
Bring down the greens and yellows in post mang

Tails xD I died
That still does not explain why Congratulations didn’t got on trending

Edit:The Video trended in many countries but not in the US
That actually makes a lot of sense at 12 min in. That’s probably why companies make new channels or never upload for movie trailers etc
I would say its a pretty big oopsie that you’re not the most subbed Channel on youtube...
2:52 what joke?
I hope etika gets better
the trending explanation still doesnt explain how your video, "sub to pewds meme needs to stop" has the same statistics as your other videos and got on trending

i call BS on that explanation. its clearly rigged.
Iggy gonna come at you hard now.
12:07 Let me give you a hand here, Felix. I think the thing you're explaining is called a logarithmic scale (that goes linearly?) Its just out of 100%

Felix not getting on trending because he always gets popular videos. Suffering from success
0:00 Haters gonna say he spoke in swedish.

Felix I appreciate your theory on why trending isn't broken... But that doesn't explain why the same Shitty hack "LATE NIGHT COMIC" videos are trending daily... it's rigged you know it, i know it, the people reading this comment know it...

They think they’re god when the money kicks in
why does Popie-San always cover PewDiePie-San? Sounds like she's got a crush on PewDiePie-San. They should get together, Popie-San is much cuter than Marzia.
Aritsts were on youtube before they knew what youtube was,"getting him on youtube" is a weak argument for sucking up to some upcoming U.S. rapper

1:00 - Looks like we wont be seeing a two weeks without a PewDiePie oppsie.
YOU LOSE
3:57 scp 096 has breached containment
1:38 the sound of death captions
Trending is heavily filtered. This is common sense. The fact that they are saying "half of trending will be creators" just proves this. They even claimed so, they purposely want to turn down what they consider "conspiracies, fake news erc" for more "authoritative" sources. 

However, their push to deliver what they perceive is "advertiser friendly content" (mainly by corporations); its had the opposite effect. They lost over 70 billion dollars in market capitalization. Mainly because they push videos that people dont want to watch.
so tell me why your youtube rewind never made trending when it popped off in viewership?
Oopsie doopsie poopsie
Pewdiepie: juice world 
Me: jews world
Its nice to see that the YouTube CEO genuinely seems to want to help creators

Both great deals if you think about it
I honestly want merch with that drawing of Sonic on it
puts sonic art on eBay for 2 grand 

bid gets up to 10 million dollars 

Felix: It’s not easy being the modern day Picasso.
I put it at 144p to make this feel like a regular video
can you please make your sonic drawing your profile pic pewds?
Doesn’t Felix’s desk raise up and down?  Why’s he bending down😂😂
My art teacher had the same confetti. So I asked her how much it cost. She said she got it at the dollar store. 😂😂👌🏻
I don't hear anything wrong with the sound quality?

I swear I have seen some of these in other vids😂
Whoever drew the Deadpool, good job. Honestly good work <3 keep practicing and you'll get far
First LWIAY and now photoshopping photos? Jacksfilms just keeps stealing your content.
THEORY: I think pewds is getting ready to move out slowly, his filming room is getting emptier and emptier.

HMMMMMMMMM
I'd be totally fine with a 
photoshop series/show on this channel
This reminds me that Ringo Starr sells prints of his MSPaint drawings for 1.5k to 5k
And they're bad MSpaint drawings.
This is how many days until he gets a better camera 

⬇️
nice, he went to 144p to 360p, he's evolving i'm proud
The picture with the family (6:20) was used as a thumbnail in a video about the wierdest families alive😂🤦‍♀️

Me: Eh close enough
pewdiepie : i have an amazing quality camera

my youtube : automaticly set to 360
Is it just me or is pewds getting skinny like really skinny
Plot twist:
The camera quality got worst.
Me: *been doing art for 16 years, gets paid for my graphic designs, gets hired by different businesses to design wall art and advertisement images* 
“I’m hoping to be an artist one day.”

That guy: 
“I am a true artist.”
existential crisis moment while watching :  
you ever watch pewds for so long and you love him so much and see him as a close friend but think that what if he actually met you and he maybe didn't like you for whatever reason and it would ruin 8 years of liking him.
You just cheered up meh day and trust me I've had a CRUDY AND I MEAN CRUDY day
Pewdiepie: *changes camera quality*

The lighting: "I'm about to end this mans whole career!"
I didn't know what kind of video this was until halfway through
9:56 that is cultural appropriation on a whole other level What even is a battle mask ? those things dont even exist in mongolia
women used to wear head jewelry but they didnt wear it under their eye 
you can actually get real head jewelry (not sure what its called in english) in 5-10 dollars


finally a chance for me to gate keep my culture 
i get it now why people gate keep everything its fun
he said “guess in the comments how much this one is” (for the flower painting) and i was like “lol probably like 20,000 or smthn smh” AND IT WAS 20,000 I AM PSYCHIC
i live in MN (where the flower picture for 20,000 was from), and i vividly remember seeing that being sold online.
will never forget.
The camera quality is better but the lighting is what's still poor
WHAT!? 480p!? THIS IS UNHEARD OF!!!! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLLLLLEEEEEEEE
I got a tuber simulator ad.
The Yeezy shirt; I have a hoodie in that same style! 
Mine's better. First, the hood. Perfect for those times when a chill wind blows in. It also has pockets and one is torn away from the fabric, at the top. Just enough to give it that "special something". Nothing but the finest for stepping out in the yard for some work.
legit i thought it started raining when the clapping at the beginning started
Pewdiepie : *changes camera quality*

Lightning : AM I A JOKE TO YOU ?!
from 0p to 420p! Finally

Pewdiepie: buys a better camera
Me: watches video on 360p
Thought this was a different type of video from the title... 😔
9:39 that's piss tho, I've got a screenshot of some game that costs $499.99. I'm not kidding, it was called Brick Out - Premium. It's been removed from the store a while ago though
"it would also hekurkurkerpukurp" Can you please repeat that?
blessed to have this video uploaded on the same day as my birthday.
Make a video about your tattoo's and the story behind them.
I wish my forking phone get 1080p to see his better version
I really like the mattress springs on the wall.
Obvious clickbait of the Logan Paul level says he will retouch your video for 5000$ and in the video he stated “please I’ll do it for 1/5th of a dollar” vox will surely get him for this
All this time we thought Felix's camera quality was bad, little did we know he was simply applying gaussian blur to all of his videos.
I think Felix’s videos are more enjoyable with the captions
That hairstyle needs a beard to work, my friend.
Hold up 




Why ppls unsubscribe?
The thumbnail showed an anime pose..
;-;
he protecc
he attacc
but most importantly
he got his ad rev bacc
I actually liked the "Cat & Banana" one (not the price, tho')
I think you set a record for most laughing in a video
Quality still sucks lol. Your Cam was fine, it just some of your export settings that are messed up
but seriously, when is the quality getting fixed
With this high quality camera i dont know who this person is.
if you haven’t read the subtitles.. you’re missing out xD
The fact that his drawing was almost sold for £10.000.000 on ebay was phenomenal.
wow.... i watched this in kinda "ok" 1080p.
We now have camera quality but edit quality died

A soul for a soul
Camera: 100%. Microphone: 0%.

Pewds : "Yes, but actually no"

Today's fact: The process by which bread toasts is called the 'Maillard Reaction'.

Pewdiepie 2019
0:36 why you looking at page? Lol were you reading?
I've been seeing a lot of comments about various qualities. Here's a list for Felix when he goes to the store

1. Buy a new camera, just go all out and spend $50k, or not. You decide.

2. Buy a new computer with maxed everything, probably costs $100k who knows, or not. You decide on the next episode.

3. Buy a new house, probably $20M maybe, who knows, or not. Yes, you decide.

4. Move somewhere before you buy a new house that has google fiber OR really good internet. 

5. Switch 3 and 4 for 4 and 3. 

6. Profit $100M and then buy youtube stock and become the new owner and replace susan.

7. Profit $100B and becomes world's richest person. 

8. Tap into the meme market.
do a live stream of editing photos of others and donate those money for charity
We want a gameplay of Ocean Turtle Simulator!
Me watching in 144p: LOOKS THE SAME TO ME!!!
his camera quality looks the same to me, or maybe its just his personal quality
As a business student would say: 
Premium pricing, done wrong!
The people who are the worst at art always think theirs is worth anything lmao
Why recommendations whyy
Pewds for 100 mil merch make a shirt with the Sonic drawing
As an artist I really do not understand how someone can charge for so much.
He mentioned Alex Jones. Look out!

Your camera keeps autofocusing
Photoshop t series sub count to 0

I actually kind of liked that "cat no banana" painting :D
Why do I want the painting of the cat and the banana lol
I'm so poor hhahah I want that jacket i looks so freakin cool
1/5 of a dollar smh
Make that amazing Sanic into a shirt.
Make a video about your tattoos and the story behind them.
the cat one was actually good
Lowkey the Tom cruise portrait isn’t too far off
why is the crack in the mountin on the tv in the background smileing?
Can you please retouch my face
Pewdiepie's camera quality is art
YOU just can't understand it.
Ты охренел почему ты не зделал русских субтитров
Mr Beast buys them all
Hahahaha going to art school you see a lot of those "naked girl with oranges" types...most people are actually pretty cool and talented. And a lot of art school is learning how to defend your work (aka the price tag)
I actually want him to buy that turtle game
Please bring back....






THE FABULIZER!!!
When your art earns 10 million... Are you the delusional one?
Wow! Those prices. 😄
I think ur camera isn’t 60 fps 😂😂
when ur art shows up in a pewdiepie video
Thank you youtube for providing me a superstar bts ad under a pewdiepie video

Before he said “I have an amazing quality camera!!!” I was thinking “this is really bad quality... is it my phone?”
you know, it's even worse because too many of us would pay £2000+ for that crap
Hii loose
11:23 Can someone explain me why these dolls in the back creep me out?
I like ur reg camera cus it like reminds me of what YouTube was and I miss that😢
Apparently pewdiepie’s art is at a highest bid for £20,000






That’s too low
I honestly think the cat and banana painting at 10:24 is really good. The price is the problem for me. I'm no expert, but I highly doubt it's worth $1200.
I don't think thats a cigarette sir
This has as many ads as most podcasts 🤣
Do u mean a 4rh of a dollar not a 5th?😬😬🤣😅😅🤣
There's like 200 comments in seconds so if u see this one

Next time you do a video with delusional artists you should make a rule that says 'You must purchase at least 1 of the things you look at' and hang it on the wall behind you for all future viewers to see, but never mention it again, leaving them to wonder 'what the f*ck is that?'. Good luck with finding your favourite!

You must follow protocol, pewds! The "sub 2 pew" meme is not dead till u review it.

Internet laws and regulations. Vol. 399, Paragraph 69, Rule: 34-420: 

"no meme is to be considered 'dead' until it is properly reviewed."
It's still revetin god damnit
आपको पता है आप नंबर 2  क्यों हो गए क्योंकि आपने उस देश के बारे में गलत कहा जो देश सदियों से महान रहा है,
जिसने सिकंदर जैसे महान राजा को पीछे मुड़ने पर विवश कर दिया था,
आपने उस देश के बारे में गलत बोला जो देश सब से प्यार करता है किसी के बारे में कभी खराब नहीं सोचता,
इस देश की सोच यह है कि पूरी दुनिया एक परिवार है सब भाई है
4:07       he kinda look like the guy from DotA
Wait, the sponsor plays was in an ad featuring Felix??  THIS IS SO NEEWWWW
Felix reading the wrong meme, and that's a proof that the editor is not brad or sive XD
There's a third editor???

Ninja easily defeated thanos by reporting him of stream snipping
Real Spoiler (don't click or you'll regret if you haven't watched the movie):





Mr Stark at the remaining avenger team tries to get all the infinity stones by time traveling. Yet thanos knew what was happening so when Hulk snapped and brought everyone back alive, a giant ship came and a war happened. When Thanos got the gauntlet, Mr Stark secretly stole the infinity stones so Thanos quickly tried to snap but it was at Mr Starks. Yes Mr Stark snapped and killed the enemy army including Thanos but Mr Stark also died because of the gauntlet... Don't blame me if you haven't watched the movie and you clicked read more

It hurts to watch cringe compilations because the cringe just reminds me of me
put thanos memes in tuber simulator, also put me in i requested to be in but idk what happened
You know i don't see a problem with priest having displeasure about the photographers behind him.. He is a regular man doing his work and he can get annoyed and distracted..
Maybe it's different culture, but as far as i know, the photography comes after the ceremony, where the couple poses for photos with guests then the celebration party and food comes into play..
1:21 That means your not a real man.
Loved that intro
Cringe Tuesdays Are My Kind of Tuesdays Cuz i Ain't Got Shit To Do

I like watching cringe Tuesday’s because I’ve already seen most of these clips but I like to see Felix react to them tbh
I feel for the teacher tho 😢

Is everyone going to ignore the fact that he said a two plus b two = c two
You forgot to put in the "take on me" clip in
You should put T series all viewers will get blind of pain.

Y O U  L A U G H  Y O U  L O S E
At 5:50 the camera quality got exceptionally bad lol xDdddddd
I can't watch this without skipping, god-damned cringe
lol i love how piers morgan didn't even say the first couple digits of Pi correctly. it's just the extra cherry on top for him trying to sound smart.
LoL really . 
There is a caption for Chinese people .

This hurt me on so many levels

But I watched it all for you Pewds
My phone literally vibrates when he  yells "angry"
i was waiting all week for this video to confirm if cringe tuesday was real or not
First of phytho theorem is a MATH FORMULA related to geometry while Pi is a MATH CONSTANT AND MATH SYMBOL. 2nd, he did NOT even list the first 5 decimal places of his own question lmao.
Also imagine being cyber bullied for that reason
That last clip literally had me laughing so hard I was rolling and crying. Like IN REAL LIFE. 

Damn, I'm a terrible person.
Wow! The cringe was real this time.
he should of just reacted to 10 minutes of the sonic trailer
We need bonus cringe with special guest

Kodak black got his cheeks clapped in jail by extension
Self-important "smart" snobs getting wrecked. Very cringe, more importantly, I hope they all see this.
I accidentally pressed the like button. I was planning on doing it. I guess my thumb was really excited about doing it and couldn't wait.

uma noite chuvosa um garoto estava navegando em seu discorde e viu uma sala co um cara esquisito nela chamado pedofelo comedor e vendedor de lolis fugitivo da f.B.i. ele estava muito enreçado por conta de nunca ter uma namora ou menina al seu lado entao resolveu comprar uma loli na quela sala mas quando entrou sua mãe abriu a porta do quarto dele e ele rapidamente fechou a página e sua mãe logo pensou que ele está preparado para ver vídeos 18+  e iria fazer um milk chak de banana com leite por isso foi a igreja ppós estava muito decepciona com tudo aquilo. 
o menino entao viu a oportunidade de comprar uma loli entao reabriu a página e entrou no Server e começou a falar com o pedofelo

  pedofelo-nao e da F.B.i.  né
   garoto-nao porque 
  pedofelo-nada nao
    garoto-então e vc que vende lolis
   pedofelo-sim
     garoto- bem entao,Eu quero uma que tem 8 anos e que fala com a voos de lolis bem fininha e que gosta de muito leitinho 
    pedofelo-ta eu entendi pode ser essa 
     loli-quero seu leitinho sem pai
     garoto- perfeita amei,pode ser essa 
     pedofelo-ta me encontre no beco na frente da sua casa 
       garoto- está bem mas como sabe aonde e minha casa 
     pedofelo-Eu sou um pedofelo vc acha que eu mão seu aonde me esconde.bem com posso dizer eu sei de muitos lugares aonde me esconde e pegar lolil
        garoto- ta 
     pedofelo-tome cuidado aqui tem muitos noias que vendem maconha etc.
  então o garoto pegou cem reais da mãe e foi até o beco mas ele nao tomou cuidado com os noias que estavam vendendo e chegou com apenas 30 reais o reSto gastou com drogas mas pelo menos chegou
      pedofelo-finalmente chegou garotinho mas bem elas está na minha van 
        garoto- ótimo cade ela
       pedofelo mão e bem assim cade o dinheiro 
          garoto-quanto e 
        pedofelo-30 reais
           garoto-ufaaaa só tenho 30 deu sertinho 
         pedofelo-e parece que deu certo e so pega a loli que está do lado da sua casa
             garoto-está bem até mais tarde
          pedofelo-até
 o garoto achou a sua loli e a primeira quoissa que fez foi asitir hentai comer coxinha  nutela e dar muito leitinho e quando foi dormi trancou a sua loli no porão e foi a cama mas quando foi em direção ao quarto o telefone ligou e ele atendeu
        garoto- oque foi
         médico-e do hospital sua mãe foi atropelada quando voltava da igreja e infelizmente veiu a obtu mas deixou uma fortuna de 1.000.000.000.000.000 de reais para você casa bom uso 
     o garoto ficou muito feliz pois estava rico e acabo comprando uma mansão com o porão mais grande do mundo e gastou todo o seu dinheiro comprando lolis e quando elas ficavam velhas e dava ao pedido para vender e então e assim eles viraram "amigos e colegas de trabalho"até a morte dos dois que foram trazicamente bocados pela f.B.i  após serem dados o maiores estrupadpres,traficantes de lolis e o mais importante eles quiaran perfis faks no discorde para se fingir de kleberiano .

   essa historia foi enspirada na musica

So, we got Cringe Tuesday
Angry Wednesday
Now where is Fridays with PewDiePie?
The cringe is still not at the level of disintegrating me... it still killed me though.
I belong to the 3% who can watch this video
i upvoted this intro on Reddit and now it's here 😢
Okay, it's possible that this is just a school that uses the same splash image on its student portal, but there's a decent chance that the teacher who was pretending to be a student is a teach at one of the branches of the college I went to and now I need to have a conversation with the board of trustees...
I like how
one day he  makes a serious video
The next he make a kind of serious vlog
Then the next day he makes this
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i love cringe tuesdays :)!!!!
Actually it’s A squared plus B squared = C squared.

i actually laughed so hard at the woman golfing thing.. am i bad person?

I think it's because she's actually Sarah Connor and she's just trying to lowkey carry out her mission of assassinating that old woman who will bake an apple pie for her grandson in the future which will give him the motivation needed to finish programming his Skynet AI.
5:42 wtf is that artifacting brad 1 ?!??!

my alexa went off when he said alexa....
Somewhere in Sweden where PewDiePie lives, there was such called Cringe tuesday
Where'as here in asia there was such called Talent tuesday (which was so shit and i barely did anything on that day)
An Indian tribe captured three men and told them all to find 10 fruits of the same kind and if they don't they'll kill them. Tom comes back with 10 apples and the tribe members tell him to put all of them in his ass without making a sound or they'll kill him. After the second apple Tom screamed and the tribe killed him. Jim comes back next with 10 grapes. He was doing well 8, 9, still counting but then he laughed and they killed him. Up in heaven Tom asks Jim why he laughed he almost lived so Jim tells him that John, the third man, came back with fucking pineapples.
You Cringe? You Loose! ???

Social ability relies heavily on fake laughter.
"The best advice to cyber bullying is
....
To love your mother"

He's so handsome
i still prefer Fridays with Pewdiepie tho :))
LOVE YOUR MOTHERS you damn cyberbullies.
cringe Tuesday makes me feel better about all the cringey things ive done without realizing
It's funny that it's so crazy that he's trying to make Prince Tuesday of thing love the cringe
Boi this is hard to watch
Your a poopy head
7:39
"Angry Wednesday" would be a good show
7:20..Ethan from h3h3 does that.
Felix has hella 90's bangs
I physically can't watch this
I can’t handle cringe tuesdays
The intro should be all of Felix’s failed hand shake attempts and sad music playing in the background
pierce is such a prat its unreal
Is it weird after I clicked on this vid I got pain in the head and in the back
Everyone sub to spray juice yt

Pewds: Watches this a day after trip
Me: Seriously making your day bad right after your trip
I honestly can't watch this Cringe Tuesdays series..

Finally we have Cringe Tuesday
For How much time we're betting he's gonna do this weekly? I give it 5 weeks
Can somebody make a intro music for Cringe tuesdays please !!!
You're doing a good job felix
This was painful but not as painful as the new Sonic movie
7:12 when you don’t know what to say anymore
Pewds: KEEP THE CYBER BULLYING!!

Media: Is he making fun of suicide?!
the photographer at 5:32 is at his rights that's what he get paid for to get the perfect picture no matter where he is or how he does it and if he annoys you either you ask normally or just pretend he is not there
omg the wedding one jajaja
0:43 felix cringe handshake
cringe tuesday is my new favorite... after pew news of course.
I can't handle that cyber bullying part 😤
Painful truly painful.
the best advice I would give to stop cyberbullying is to turn off the computer. Ignorance is also another option. So is blocking. Thank you.
I hada ff thru these... What a strange phenomenon cringing...
99% can’t watch

PewNews-News about memes
LWIAY-Watching memes
Cringe tuesdays-Cringing to memes

Thanks internet!
This has nothing with her being a women she’s just a bad player like anyone ever
i praise cringe tuesdays 😌
this video made me feel better about myself because at least i wasnt them to face that type of pain.
When did Felix start pulling out the middle part? 





His hair looks like it belongs in a 90s teenage sitcom.
Пьюдс скажи что я написал
She didn't even apologiz
I sometimes forget Felix is a conventionally attractive, rich guy with a hot fiancee. Its hard to remember that when I see him literally jump out of a shelf and scream incoherently.
marzia should be a disney voice actor.
a swedish
has an italian fiancee
live in uk
loves anime & japanese culture
selling russian merch 
a kpop fanboy
travel around morocco
fight againts indian music company
and american media still call him a racist.

TRULY MR. WORLDWIDE
"We're about to go on our private jet" shows EasyJet
How can you not love this guy
He's acting and joking like Pewds from 2012-2013
Marzia: takes control of camera
Camera quality: INCREASES BY 1000%
them dancing melts my goddamn heart and seeing felix showing raw emotion when he's having fun with marzia just.. IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS
Look at that big bird. Look at the cat. Look at the big bird. Look at that cat. Repeat
I'm still missing on the travel vlogs from Marzia. Missing her in general. :(
Good vid, bud.
Behind this overly misunderstood man, there’s a soft boi
nobody:


Felix's glasses: <>-<>
This is 2019 and the guy still makes youtube videos with a late 2000s touch. I respect that. Subscribed, lets go for 100M.
No one: 
Literally no one:
Pewds: I bought sum pringles 🤣❤️ 5:22
the first thing he does in the hotel bed on a romantic trip is to fart casually. couple goals right there.
Awwww poor dog. 5 seconds later




Go To ThE sHaDoW yOu DuMmY
Yo Felix and Marzia were like unusually close this video, I think they might be dating.
Pays thousands for a professional camera: 360p
Uses phone as camera: 4K
This makes me miss Marzia's channel so much. 

You should let her take over the travel vlogs on your channel.
I'm actually really happy for Felix, who else agrees ?
Lol I know Felix is rich but don't get me wrong he saved



2 pounds
Marzia, the aesthetic queen: film the wall
Felix, shaky camera: films birds
Half the video is just him filming birds and cats😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Nobody:

PewDiePie:Bigg bird! Everybody BIG BIRD!
6:30 
Logan paul be like “where the corpses at”
If that "big bird" doesn't become a meme I'm mad
When marzia holds the camera it magically turns into HD
I was at Marrakesh 1 year ago, I was in the same place as Pewdiepie. Felix has stepped on the same mark as me!!! :O
I legit cried, this is so cute and wholesome MORE PLEASE
Sad to say Marzia is Pewds ex-girlfriend. 





She is his  now
Pewdiepie: our secret trip




Me: 
When she has the camera is like a professional videographer then pews is like a baby grabbing the camera lol
You guys are the cutest couple I’ve ever seen💖AND THATS SAYING A LOT I LOVE YOU GUYS
When Marzia films, the camera quality automatically becomes 399% better than when Felix films.
Why your girlfriend has so tiny voice. She sound like a cute hamster that can talk!
*it is pewds Secret Trip
So he uploads it on YouTube
When marzia holds the camera it magically turns into HD
He protect
He Attac 
But most importantly...

He laid back😎
Definitely knew I should keep watching after 3:14. 10/10 👏🏼
Pewdiepie saying “waddup cat” to every cat he sees for 14 minutes straight
Bro when you made that noise at the very start of the vid it scared my dog
Marzia's Instagram: full of cute walls and sunsets 

Felix: loOk aT THIS B I R   D
That's a bird look at that bird that's a big big bird look at that bird
I appreciate that he isnt a very ignorant, sheltered traveler. He's very mature and comfortable and open minded. EVERY OTHER YOUTUBER makes me want to throw up during their travel vlogs
I’m sad so I liked my own comment
At 8:08 I thought he said “awww corn dog “
When you just realized how you missed to see Marzia
WHATTTTT NOOO WAYYY DUUDE IM Moroccan and i watched you since the amnesia videos or even before dude , you are welcome here in Morocco enjoy your stay ❤❤❤ ( even tho i prefer beach Moroccan cities over Marrackesh , just my personal preference )
0:50 can we pls talk about his sunglasses omg d0p3
The ending was just beautiful. What a beautiful ring for the beautiful couple
6:30
A random brazilian speaking "Tu vai tirar a foto quando entrar"
Marzia:appreciating the beauty 



Felix:whoah thats a big bird
3:33 "Listen" sounds vaguely like the fairy Navi from The Legends of Zelda 😂😂😂
yo this Marzia girl is so chill she should start a vlog channel
4:07 thanks Marzia for making it aesthetic HAHAHHAA
Video’s Title:Sercet Trip
Pewd:Starting Rec Video...
Wow here’s me emotional for 14:25 minutes I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
10:00 I felt so sorry for the cat
😢
thanks for visiting my home country morocco actually i live in safi
8/10 more birds please
Can we appreciate brad and sives extra work in vlogs of adding photoshp legs to felix?
Felex also: goes on holiday to see new place "look at that big bird."
4:07 felix, why are you so damn hot
My last 2 brain cells when they have to do anything: 0:01
when Felix films the quality is 144p but when Marzia picks up the camera it automatically  changes to 1080p
Holy shit!! I've been there
In that room 
Me and Felix have slept next to each other (technically)
Nobody:
Felix:Look at that bird
my man, how did you get this angel!?!?
WTF OF THE WHOLE WORLD! YOU ACTUALLY CHOOSE MARRAKECH! That is your best choice ever make since you started a youtube channel back in 2010!
Marzia: makes beautiful video on their vacations 


Felix: so this is our bed, *instantly falls off it*
But that day gone so far...
He is belonged to me younger sister, Mao Zi.
inthefrow was just there.
Looks like famous youtubers went there together.
Why does he have such a poor video quality 
But it doesn’t matter he us pewdie pie ✌🏽
My heart can't take this ❤️ they are truely so cute 
This video made me realize how sweet felix is and how attractive he can be.. but most importantly marzia is a true goddess
Felix: "Our secret trip"

Marzia's Instagram: Am I a joke to you?
This video had more foot fetish potential ever

♥️

You can always tell who’s filming based on shakiness.
" that's the tip "
STOP travelling and play Fortnite❗️
You two are the cutest couple on earth I swear
I thought it was so awesome and loved seeing how your the biggest YouTuber and have so much money but still patiently wait in an endless line with people... Respect! ❤️
Marzia: This is so beautiful and it's our proposal anniversary

Felix: MOM I DIDN'T GET SUNBURNT

Welcome to Marrakech 😍❤️.

I feel bad for the editor who had to CGI in his legs the whole time!
I love it how they held hands during that water slide. 


Promise of a lifetime.
the joji thing got me flying btw thats one of morrocco's ancient kings
Just 100km away from the Canary Islands D:
If your little brother eats your last pizza piece: 0:00

This will probably be a meme
Pewdiepie seems so much happier when he is around Marzia and it makes me smile when I see them together.  <3 2019 best couple BY FAR.

Oofff my mind is turning green!
Am Moroccan
"poor dog, go to the shadow, you dummy!" Lol! this is why pews is my favorite YouTuber
Hey. I've been there. I'm getting PTSD from the "no" saying.
Last video: talks about serious stuff in a mature way

This video: lays on the bed and farts
I train the Oxxydes. 
But Oxxydes is fake.
the streets remind me of that one mission from bo2
Felix: films wall
Me: gets instant flashbacks about uncharted 4
Also me: remembers own name
Her parents chose 2 single beds intentionally
I went from 144p to 4K when Marzia started recording
For a youtuber with 95M subs, he doesn't get a lot of views per vid.
You should come to Turkey ASAP 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
this should be titled felix getting excited about birds for 14 minutes and 24 seconds
He such a beautiful voice (^o^)
wow look it’s a kitten

felix, an intellectual :  tiny cat *
13:41 why did he get an ENTIRELY different camera just for this shot
Why is the title in Spanish?
3:44  creepy voice Beautiful view.
JK 😂
the dance at the end melted my heart it was so cute
Felix: holds camera for beginning of vid
Camera: 140p
Also Felix: gives marzia camera to film him
Camera: 1080p
Marzia: 
Camera: 140p

Trinh Nhai Jasmine Pearl and Son Minh Mountain Bright should be together
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME ALL THE WAY HERE AND I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO SEE YOU
No ones gunna talk bout filthy frank? 😢
Try going to saidi bou Said in Tunisia it's so so pretty! Iv gone there and I would highly recommend 💖💖 btw if you ever go there try the bambalouni it's so good😂👌
Pewdiepie holding the camera : 144p

Marzia holding the camera : 4K
6:30'dan sonra Türkçe konuşan birileri mi var yoksa bana mı öyle geliyor  ⊂(´・ω・｀⊂)
جاك السم 😂😂
Why does it say this was uploaded 6 minutes ago?
They can actually understand 'no' means no 
but they will try to sell you stuff (maybe scam you but idk ) 
i've been there multiple times and even as a guy that speaks arabic and is morrocan
they keep trying to sell me stuff so get used to it xddd
When you realize that Felix created this channel on the 29th of april 2010, exactly 9 years ago and now we all are the 9-year-old-family*.
Happy channel-anniversary Felix!
❤❤❤



*Edit:
As rightfully pointed out in the comments, we no longer are an army but a family. Or maybe the 9-year-old veterans?
Idk why I got emotional when they danced-
Feels weird watching this video and seeing the exact places I went to (the main square, the bamboo forest looking place) back in 2012
Filthy Frank? That's Morocco's current king LMAO.
6:32 "Mano, pelo amor de Deus" Brazilians everywhere boys!!!
Normal people: Pls do a face reveal 

PewDiePie fans: pls do a 1080p reveal

Pewds glasses : '-<>-<>-'
How funny that he is non stop astonished of seeing stork xd
My favorite part if the video was when they were dancing near the end. That was sweet. Also when he mentioned Slippy. I feel like he was about to cry and so was I.
I find it so so so sad that there’s a bunch of skinny stray kittens and dogs 

It breaks my heart :(
Felix looks handsome with that new haircut!
Pewdiepie: Takes camera back from Marziapie
Camera: Starts shaking and quality goes down to 360p

It's a curse

Почему голос Марции смахивает на голос маленькой Клементины из ТВД ??
I went there in spring my break
Pewdiepie: Let's end this movement.

Everyone: NATIONAL PEWDIEPIE DAY
I think this is edited by Brad 3 (marzia)
Welcome to morocco is there any morrocan people in this video if ur there hit a like 🤫🤫🔥
Your vlogs always make me smile😊
Felix: This is a total cultural shock.
Me: Tries to figure out why and remembers he lives in UK. 


South Africa is almost just like this, depending on where you are.
Seeing Felix laugh, smile and being him silly self is really nice to see :)



EDIT: Well, thank you for all the likes. Never imagined getting so many oO
And thank you being there for Pewds.

In Meme Review, he is known as PewDiePie.

But in vlogs like these, he is known as Felix.
Is it a secret trip if you post about it
Every trip he takes, is apparently secret
Wait legzz??
I cried a lot. I just want to travel but my passport and all of my commitment sense is gone away
Marzia : Beautiful steady shot
Felix : Motion sickness level 100 ^^
I don't get it. Why is this guy so popular?

Felix's title: Our secret trip
The video's reality: Bird documentary


Edit: While im up here - Remember that nothing anyone ever thinks about you, says about you, or DOES to you, not even your past or current circumstances, NONE of that defines your worth. You'll always be worth a world and more and nothing can ever change that.
How could someone dislike this?
The pube on 1:07 🤣

Was he purposely not filming Marzia’s face?
Boiii wtf
I honestly couldn’t stop smiling. It makes me happy when y’all are happy! You should post more vlogs often, because this video was just beautiful.
i have NEVER liked romance. never. it’s always been so boring to me in movies and books and whenever someone mentions their s/o i have to force myself to be interested in the lame story they’re about to tell me about them.

but this. i couldn’t stop smiling. felix and marzia together are wonderful. they make me think love is kinda’ cool.
Notice MEEEE! Plleeaase
Wait, were you two alone in that hotel? Don't tell me it was closed exclusively for you guys. XD

To everyone saying that this wasn't a secret trip if he posted it on YouTube:


I'm pretty sure he meant "secret", as in, nobody knew they were going there beforehand. Thus, nobody could possibly ruin/interrupt what was supposed to be a romantic getaway for Felix and Marzia.
Welcome to morocco
5 million subs to go till we hit billion omg
Does anyone know the camera model he used ?
Sorry pew Di .
I miss Marzia's videos. They were so aesthetically pleasing, super chill and nice to watch. Miss you Marzia 💘

I can't handle this video. Pewds is so down to earth 24/7 Marzia makes him so happy. They are literally the sweetest things. The shakiness of the camera makes it just THAT much more real and makes me honored to witness their love.
Pewdiepie Were a cloak master rather than spy from tf2
(Heard about dreadout? I speak dreadout)
The Bro Army is officially 9 years old today.

One word:

How sweet!! 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕
Nine year olds,
it’s been an honor.
But tomorrow...






We turn into ten year olds.
Finally something where the YouTuber doesn’t fake cry for attention
Hey, you’ve done the right thing mate. We are proud of you. Yea, some of us are sad that we won’t be able to scream sub to Pewdiepie! But at least we know there is an important reason to it.
Cause of this video FlareTV lost 90% of its viewers 😂 
RIP
Pewdiepie: *makes a good apology video*

Media: Are you making fun of james charles?
PewDiePie: Finally does a serious video.

Youtube: Now you can trend
After looking at this video....







Mr.Stark I don’t feel so good


thanks for 730 likes! Omgggg here’s your prize:








ENDGAME SPOILER ALERT:




Ironman is......







a defeating thanos boi
I'm Japanese but I was struck.
I'm not very good at English so I don't know how to express it.
I wanted to support you from the bottom of my heart.
It may be strange suddenly, but please do your best from now on!
We will lose the sub war in a few months but at least we fell as an empire as absolute legends. Stay strong gamers. Bro fist at 100 mil 👊🏻
Much love to an idiot that I've watched for 4 years and who I'll stick with.❤️🤗
You're a good man felix. Well said. 👏
My fellow lads...we fought hard..we fought long...but all conflicts come to an end... yes T-Series may reach 100M first...but at least we will not lose as the villain...At ease men!
Let's give this a new name




PewDiePie VS T-Series 
YouTube War 1 (YW1)
Su- sees video  o-o
Suh- Suh-
Suh-...








Super duper video !
He will still be nr. 1 on individual creators 
No matter what happens, i will still be subbing to Pewdiepie, cus he's the Best indervidual creator  i have seen in a long time...
This is proof that YouTube picks what should be on trending
You may be losing..
But in our hearts You're winning ;)
Why is this guy so good and humble. Bruv just make him the head of the UN or something
Me: watches video


Me again: I’m pretty sure mrbeast has something to say
I had a video when this came out but I need to change it. Guys this is serious. Also how come whenever he’s serious, his accent is bold
YouTube doing the right thing by putting this on trending. Well done.
I'm proud of you Pewds and srry India and T-Series
GG
Peace
Pewd:Pewd made a good apology video


Media:Are u making fun of beauty community in utube
Pew die pie don't scare because signature move will always a signature move which is t series😪 and we are a finisher move 🤑😍🤩
Makes me feel horrible to see how these things effected someone we all look up to. It was fun while it lasted, but I agree that it ends here. You have come so far and it's amazing to be able to witness it. Love ya ❤️
This is his most serious he has been on camera, you can tell he really wants this to stop
Pewdiepie: makes this video
Yt: congratulations! You can now be in rewind
Even tho you didn't won the war a lot of people tried hard to support you
PewDiePie will forever be our king
Not fight to T Series without companying T-series rich 100 million subscriber in some day
You know pewdiepie, that was a good thing what u did and don’t let that get to u. Keep up the good work Sincerely, Carmine
Today is PewDiePie's 9th Year Anniversary when his channel was created. 


Brofist
Don’t worry guys even if t series reaches 100 mil Pewdiepie will still be the number one YOUTUBER because t series is a corporation
At least he is the #1 Non music Channel in the world ;)
It’s ok bro things like this happen
Ironically, this video made me sub to PewDiePie
It was never India vs the world.
It was creator vs corporation.
Godspeed, my friend.
Thank you for this pewds 👏🏼 I’ve been a fan for 7 years now, and I’ve always admired you. Your videos has helped me immensely with my depression as well.

When this TSeries vs Pewdiepie thing began, I found it all irony and very funny, especially since I knew about Tseries being Indian, and how your humor is.

But I think this was the first time I genuinely started to get hurt from other Bros with racist remarks and slurs. Being compared to as dogs. It became an India vs Pewdiepie thing and so many people took it so far I couldn’t even watch your videos for a while. 

Sub 2 Pewds is a great meme and people did awesome things with it. But please, take a look around at how some Bros have been acting to Indians or about Indians and switch Indian with your race to understand the full extent of how toxic this all became.

I knew it got too far once your name was dragged in by the Christchurch Shooter. I am so glad you put an end to this 👏🏼 Pewdiepie forever 💗
YOU ARE THE BEST. Even if you are not no 1
T series: we won 🎉🎊 



Us nine year old:😴 yall hear sum
Me: *play the bridge of khazad dum :'(
No sigh at the beginning 
No turning on or off the camera
No fake crying
No blaming others 
WATAFOK 96M ALREADY!? I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE OMG
Cause of this video FlareTV lost 90% of its viewers 😂 RIP
Thanks pewds, i really appreciate you doing this video
But, again, i'm sorry, but since Christchurch tragedy, i can't just not remember that tragedy when watching your videos, i don't know why
Maybe because you still promoting "sub to pewds" even right after the tragedy, but i dunno
I know, i'm no one, but i just want you to know this
you are best and im really like you so you have to get more subs than t series
There's always that 1 kid who ruins it for the entire class, from the 9 year olds to you, thank you.
Ну кстати керченский стрелок был подписан на одного блогера стримера Джесуса АВГН и когда сам Хесус узнал об этом он охуел..
You’ll still the number 1 one man content creator. Sure T-Series passed but their are a company. So in a way your still the most subscribed channel on YouTube as a single creator. Also wasn’t YouTube music the most subscribed channel because they already have gotten to 100 million subs before you and T-Series. 

Hopefully you understand what I’m saying and that it makes sense because I didn’t know how to put this into words
@MrBeast We Got You In the Video
Well t-series is winning boys it’s been an honour fighting with you👊
We were lucky to have Felix... look at how fame and money corrupts most people... not Felix though.
We love you Felix! Keep doing what you do bro!
Remember this:
-Pewdiepie is the most subscribed YouTube Gamer
- T-Series is the most subscribed YouTube Company
T-Series is a company, Pewdiepie is an independent gamer. Pewds is still the most subscribed YouTuber even if T-Series beats him. There's technically no winner at this point.
Welp, we’ll never know pewdiepie’s true IQ for a while. Rip T-series




In our dreams
We will do a final salute. 👊
In my 7 years of watching PewDiePie i don't think i have ever seen him this serious before
Huge props man!
We, will not give up. What ever it takes. You will be #1. Nor, if the meme is dead or not.
pewdie pls dont stop we are losing 😭😭😭 i post poster to save u pls
you did the right thing here for this. It really did go to far and im happy to see that you ended this. :)
I will help find some one and ask sub to pewdiepie
The amount of respect for Felix for making this...
Let's say Sorry to India and Indian people!
We have blame & insult them alot.
So sorry T series 
I promise ill be nice to you
Friends :)
Yassssss he put lithuanians žalgirio cheerleaders in here!! Whos from lithuania?? I guess nobody :(((
Doc: don’t worry serious pewdiepie isn’t real
Serious pewdiepie:
You know it’s a serious video when 
1. The thumbnail isn’t crazy 
2. When his voice is monotone 
3. When it’s #1 on trending
When you loose , say something like this
Well I Guess It's Too Late Now..
The Dynasty Is Over
Many people have thought that pewdipie has made diss tracks for hatred towards t-series while I, too, thought that his irony was understood by everyone
"Part of the journey is the end"
His camera Is on 240p, but his heart is 4k.
Now T SERIE HAVE 99MIL 
WE SHOUND DO SOMETHING?
Man this made me cry 😭 broke my heart mate I feel you i feel so sad 
I cannot say sub to pewdiepie at school😭
But keep up making us Happy do 
I love your vids so much tnx for making me/us hapoy mate
Moral of whole drama- don't mess with india
i think how you handled the NZ shooting sub situation was really good. to debunk it quick was the smart thing to do. i think it helped keep the attention where it should be, with the families and with a nation that was in morning. thumbs up
*YouTube sees “ending” and “Pewdiepie” in the same sentence*

*puts it at #1 on the trending page*
you're still the most subscribed youtuber! :D
(t-series is NOT a youtuber AT ALL)
Been an honor serving with you guys :)
The advertising is gone and now








T series I winning 🙁
T Series is winning booo😫👿😤

Stay strong bro we all are with you👊😇
These people deserve a big thank you
Respect pewdiepie!!
I subscribed for not t-series vs pewdiepie but for his wonderful approach to stop this and his attitude towards the things happening.
I actually don’t watch your videos, but this shows that you’re bigger than them. Thank you, Felix.
He stayed serious till the end not even a funny moment,that was surprising
Mitrooon
Aayega to tseries hi
Its may now t series is at 99-266-605 and pewdiepie is at 96-014880
Pew you won my heart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
But T-series wins
So when he says to stop, that's when it goes on trending

I see you YouTube, think you're slick

PS: After the first time I commented this it got almost 800 likes, then it got shadow banned . So I'll post it again so people can see, hopefully YouTube will not take it down since I guess it made too much sense.

This is round 3 by the way, round 2 got 1.7k likes. If YouTube shadow bans it, I'll Just repost and add on.

Edit: If you come back and this comment isn't anywhere to be found, just wait. It will be back
But I subscribe to you not because of anything but I looked at your video and love you lol
The T-series wins but we don't lose because this war is nonsense.
still the god of apoligy videos. even for stuff he didn't do
You are nice YouTuber don t think about sub constraints on your video
All of PewDiePies video: Never trending

This video: Trending
War is over t series win😂😂😂😂
Even if he loses he will be number 1 for us

Our emperor has called for our surrender
Pewds: Declares the end of the war

YouTube: Ya know what I’ll let ya have this Trending just this once
Respect bro goed man 👏👏👊👊✌️

CJ being a pewdiepie fan:I can't believe that meme is gone


CJ being a T-Series fan: CJ REMEMBER THAT!!!
Ya I was totally lost and didn’t know who you were when I saw people posting about it until now... lol 😝💜😝
This was an important video, and its spot on. Well spoken pewds. Luv u

Today is PewDiePie's 9th Year Anniversary when his channel was created. 


Brofist
At first I thought it was a meme🤯
This was always going to end in legal action. Tseries is a business and I'm sad to see them so butthurt over jokes. We will respect your wishes, though. 

👊👊👊
I get you man such a strong start I now we need to stop it’s gone to far we’re very sorry
Iron man is................... D...............damn good
Community: What if we fall?

Felix: Then it shall be the noblest fall in history
And off-screen he has guns pointed at him.
i accept to end this with love and not hate
damn, he finally killed the biggest and most glorious meme of all


still respect his decision tho
You know it’s a serious video when 
1. No tuber simulator ad
2. Monotone voice
3. It’s less than 10 min
4. Not a weird thumbnail 
5. It’s #1 trending
Plaese250abonné😭😭
Congratulation t series but i still love you pewdiepie
GG Felix . keep going!
Pewdiepie: "I want to talk seriously and honestly" 


entire fanbase: "wait, that's illegal!"
It's time to grow up, I guess.

From today onwards, I am a ten-year-old.
Mr. Pewdiepie




I dont feel so good
Ooooo you lost man the main reason you lost is because of your distrack
Imagine Mr Beasts reaction to this video
Im so confused he have a point but why
His meme was so powerful, it couldn't even take meme review to kill it.
Sweden 🇸🇪gave legends-
Avicii
Swedish House mafia
Felix 
And still counting
This is literally sad
Pewdiepie I Respect U With This THANK U PEWDIEPIE WE ALWAYS LOVE U
ITS NOT THE END
Pewds: uploads many videos everyday
Youtube Trending: Nah
Also pewds: *uploads one video about
ending the sub to pewdiepie meme*
Youtube Trending: Ok...
On 28th was my B-day and u broken :((((
Ok honestly this video really made me respect Felix
I had always despised the hate produced in his name but knowing his dislike for it was somewhat warming
Even though you gave up.Your still The biggest and best YouTuber in my heart.
The next meme to end:






My life
Pewdiepie: uploads quality content
YouTube: nOPE no trending for you!
Pewdiepie: uploads apology and the end to his huge growth
YouTube: T R E N D I N G
"Mr Beast, I don't feel so good"
But T series won 😍😍😍
We may have lost, but we’re not defeated .... T-Series we’ll be back, when u least expect it. The 9 year old army and OG Bros will rise again.
It's OK your no. 1 in our heart if you not on no. 1 in YouTube love u pew
#1 on trending, finally something actually worth the spot
Instead Midnight Coco Vs maoam George
The youtube world war 1 is over
This man, no Swedish man. Can now finally rest with peace, after clearing his heart out. It was sincere and real, not like fake youtubers. It's really brave, letting your feeling out into the community and it should be supported.
hahahaha pewdie pie got scared tu iske layak bhi nahi pewdey
Hands down PewDiePie can never be removed from all our hearts.
Respect bro!
so much respect for this guy, love him
Can we help each other by subscribing
Mar jaaaa tu

Love from India
WOW! People took that from a fun and entertaining thing to a sick and terrible thing.

I'm so sorry that happened! 

You handled this well.
PewDiePie: Ends his own meme

YouTube: I think it's time to do our part. PewDiePie is #1 on trending
We can rest now from a war.

Greetings from Poland

Damn, the CIA is after Pewdiepie like that?
Whyyyyyyyyy😩😩
I disagree with blocking the disstracks, but everything else is a good call. The war is over, it's time to grow up.


Tomorrow, we are 10 year olds.
Bro he was so respectful during this video. Thank you for not being dramatic.
Gamers please rise for your national anthem
I really love that he's so calm , so down to earth omg 
he's not like some of us we had 700 subs and felt like we own the world
We are now in endgame
Pewdiepie: Makes video about ending his meme

Youtube: Hey god damn this is relevant
Tati and James😂😂
MAKE NEXT VIDEO TO SAY SORRY INDIANS
Your still Epic Bro.. 👊🏻
I am an Indian and I support you PewDiePie
Hard to see felix so serious but he’s right. We love you felix
Shows his bond with viewers
Even though it ended, no sighs crying & all that drama that's the reason we care about pewd.
Pewdiepie did nothing wrong.
It’s disgusting how somebody vile would mention an innocent persons name in such a negative light.
The serious video has been trending on YouTube.
I live in Christchurch and it was scary. I give love to all the families who were affected. (And Pewdiepie. ❤)
T series the best
го спо ди чё ятут делаю
Fuckboi. Lame war.
Can I still jam to bch lasagna?
Why does everyone take everything this poor man does out of context and ruins it? Disgusting
You are such a good person.👊
Pretty much exactly what Trump has been dealing with since he was elected.
Thank you very much for this very important Video !
T series hit 99 million
T series might be number one but 


PewDiePie is number one in our hearts
😢😢😭 just cry
Aayega to t series hi
Don't give up 😁😁😁😁😁

The Last Win
The comment section proves that the craziest people, are the most maturest.
Were in the Endgame now....
Well you can't have the profit for your entire life you have to move on
Ok Pewds, happy that it ended but you will still be the #1 youtuber i love!
Dont GIVE UP BRO YOU can win
I'm an Indian and as an Indian I'm happy t series won but as  a human I'm not so glad about thinking what had happened in the name of pewdiepie.... Good work Felix... 
Nice to fight with you
no but srsly still sub to pewdiepie (not including the meme)
Bow to the king for the final time, for the sake of the kingdom, he gave up his crown.
Community: What if we fall?

Felix: Then it shall be the noblest fall in history
Passing racist comments in the name of JOKE just increase the hate towards a community.
So you started all this Felix and YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THAT HAPPENED.
We still love you pewds 👑❤
Yes it is very mess up thank you so much for help those people.
Even if he isnt the #1 subscribed youtuber.





He will always be the number #1 youtuber
You know you're a legend when you kill your own meme
But you wins our hearts 🤘😍💙
PewDiePie will certainly go down as the world's best YouTuber! Please save PewDiePie!!
Good on you Felix. 

Whoever tries to say that this man is not a good man... Well, let's just say that evidently they couldn't be more wrong.
It’s a little too late for April fools ;-;
RESPECT FOR NO SAD MUSIC PLAYING
Rip .....99 milon
I think we need more emails mate
Thank you very much for this very important Video !
World war 2 ended LOL (Just a joke not taking it serious)
Thanking for ending this meme. everyday I would go to shops I would seee ads to sub to you Thanks Felix god bless 🙏🙌
Was fun while it lasted. Now we can focus on what's really important.

THE WEDDING
He  lose finally . It's a celebration T series.
If this meme is dead just make an unsub to t series meme
You have Chance pewdiepie. Your the best.
I have so much respect for this man. Some people fail to see that behind all the jokes, Felix is very humble and mature, and has his heart in the right place. I wish you and Marzia the best.
I don't know if this apology is satisfying or not. I myself was a PewDiePie supporter but also a T-SERIES supporter. But since the incident of this race of 'PEWDIEPIE VS T-SERIES' I have been hurt in many ways. I got bullied in school for not supporting PewDiePie anymore.
I saw people doing many things related to him but then they just started these stereotypes which came from one of his Diss Tracks. The stereotype was that because T-SERIES are Indians then they will probably lose because Indians suck. Many of these stereotypes came from children of my age and greater than my age. I saw that my school got divided and everyone were hitting each other just because of this meme.
I appreciate the effort taken by all those people who did so many things, but these things just became harmful for children like me. People will divide each other because of this small little thing. Those Diss Tracks might be fun for those who do not belong to India, but they aren't fun for us Indians. I still see people insulting my country and my people and T-SERIES for this race.
I have said what I have said.
Well guys we lose... R.I.P. the brofist😢
You have leveled up in respect to level 100,000,000
Tseries first youtube channel (other than youtube's channel) to hit 100 million subs
Community: Wait if we fall?

Felix: Then it shall be the noblest fall in history
Your the best
Btw how the hell did this got posted on my bday
Says he doesn’t support the shooting but is also suiting up for a crusade
Im so proud of this community
Pewdiepie: Talks about ending sub to pewdiepie meme
YouTube: Let this video continue to be number 1 trending
You spread hatred
Im sill helping you❤️😊Cuz t series has to many bots now..
T series is just ruining the competition because of sub bottling all I care about is that PewDiePie gets to 100 mill legitimately
From one guy in 🇨🇿


Nnnoooo you are for me best YouTuber

T series is a good
Why does many companies make channels in *YOU*tube anyways?
Even if we lost, we still couldn't leave Pew 
Pewdiepie forever (♥´∀｀)／
A meme either dies a hero or lives long enough to become a villain.
U know u losed to t series
Now you know you are loosing & this happens 😂
This dude is a good dude
Putting aside all seriousness... that is HORRIBLE audio
You may be the #2 youtuber now but you're still our #1
Why I want to you win t series using sub bot
When this came out my social studies teacher talked about it for current events and we watched the video, we talked about it for like a half hour
#teampewdiepie
We lost but deep down we won...
Grankids: Have you ever fought in any wars?

80 year old me: Smiles
Thank you T is best
I'm from Kaunas ❤️❤️🇱🇹
when your indian..
T-series already had almost double the watching hours than any , this support movement was bound to crash
I feel so sorry for him... 
He has a lot of pressure on his shoulders, you can tell...
This is my first PewDiePie video😅
Your still the no. 1 youtuber for us even to lose and win your still the best out of the best and BTW the respect is yours
maachod degaye indian ab mat bolna kuch humko
Its Not the End you need to never give up.
The day he stops doing YouTube,
I'm uninstalling it.
❤️❤️❤️❤️ yes I will subscribe to you but not to beat Tseries because your funny and I love your video your awesome ❤️❤️❤️🥰
And dont forget to thank TSeries , because without its help , you could never make 95million subscribes.
So specially thank to T Series.

Ok.
This is not the war anymore it’s the endgame
the meme is over but our support of u won’t end :)
Haarne lge to gand phat gyi..
The war is over. We'll keep it that way.

But T-Series still sucks the big gay
I think after this 
PewDiePie deserve to be loved in India.
Because we Indians have nature to   forgive and love someone who realized his mistake..

Ghar ka bhula ager sham ko vapis aa jye to use bhula nhi kehte.
And Jai hind jai hind ki Sena( evry Indian)


Btw_ayega to Modi hi;)
I sub you🙂
You know its serious when he is not loud and has different hair style
The war is over now is......    




James Charles vs Tati 🤣😂
Haaaaaa t series ftw
It was an Honor, felix.
Now being indian i am very happy that you lost to t series. Not happy because t series is indian but happy because you abuses india so many times.

"What did it cost?"
Pewds: "everything"
Pwe is the real man ❤️🙌🏻
You're still the number 1 in our hearts...
Pewdiepie lost the war but he still have my respect
Is it normal for people to bully other people just because they're subscribed to t-series

Stop hating on India, but hate in T Series
i hate how people decide to turn something fun into just pure crap :(
Pewdiepie: 10's of million of views 
Youtube: 
Pewdiepie: it's all my fault
YouTube: EVERYONE LOOK
You have started all foolish things, using wrong words against Indian.
T have 3m then u
I'm not subscribed and.. I just won't do. Bye

Love from india🇮🇳
You may not be #1 channel, but you are the #1 YOUTUBER
After looking this video makes me sad
No one gonna talk he is about to get in tears at the middle of the video?
R.I.P PEW TRIED SO HARD TO BE NUMBER 1 BUT BUT BUT......🤣🤣🤣
Well...If pewds is ok not hitting 100m subs.....Its ok for me as well
The day he stops doing YouTube, I'm uninstalling it.
You a fan to t-series
Why make T-Series your enemy when you can collab?
Hey, lemme say,
Even if t series got more subs than pew, that makes him better NOT!
Don’t worry guys, Larry vs Barry is here.
After watching this video, I am no longer nine years old...

comrades, I’ve turned 10

Edit: comrades, even though I’ve turned 10, I can still give thanks for 1 thousand likes. if you see me on any other videos, please use 
It's pointless to compete against someone using bots


The effort wasn't the best, but anyway... 1% of the population is subbed to you... We don't need a 2% already (155 million since I posted this comment)
this will be remembered
@spbutler19
don't give up 🎵
Well understood. If the meme is over, we will respect that. Respect.
you're still the number one in my heart. 
- a bro
It’s ok we understand like what android #16 said to teen gohan he told him to let it go and basically saying just forget what other people say and do the right thing
Loser😂😂😂...thats why you should never be overconfident
were in the end game now
“Don’t cry because it ended, smile because it happened.” -Dr.Seuss

I respect the decision you made, Felix. 👊
The war has been ceased yet we still honored that you are our king, forever ♥️
I like how low quality looking your vid is. It reminds me of old Youtube. I love how you don’t look like you’re in a studio.
Are

In other words: people ruin everything.
We understand my lord.

Our mate.
The nine year olds thank you for everything.
We will stop the meme. 
Love you pewds.

Even after this much u couldn't beat tseries😂🤣
This will be the end of Wakanda.

Damn. A YouTuber with clout that actually has brain cells. You are rare.
I love this so much! Proud of you Pewds ❤ such a humble and down to earth person
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂L
Thank you Felix for calling it what it is, it's terrorism and thank you for being so responsible about this whole situation. It is such a disgusting thing to have your name attached to something like that and it was the smart route to take to just seperate yourself entirely from it. Keep doing your thing homeslice
From screaming at barrels to talking genuinely to your audience.

You will always be #1 in our hearts, Felix.
Nice video 







Teri maa ka bhosda

Pewdiepie: aM a JoKe tO yOu?
The problem with the world is that human beings are confused as like what to accept and what to reject.A channel became the most subscribed channel i.e. of course bcoz the man behind that. No. 1 channel on the YouTube platform will always be pewdiepie and of course the subs don't matter.Never did to a man's immense work he has done in his life.Either way most of the world is filled with negativity and it gets spread in a mysterious way.
Hey pew,If you are reading this we all love you no homo tho.We all supported you like king but t series USED sub bots even though you loss YOU WILL STILL BE OUR KING❤💕
i dont care about t series.

It was a good try. Every good thing has to come to an end. :'(
Your making me cry because of exam i didn't know you even making this video it's been 3 weeks since and i just saw this I'm literally crying 😰😰😥
The fact that this video of all he posted got #1 really shows that YouTube strictly chooses what goes on trending.
I found this really responsibly
I watched this when there were 6,999,999 views
Tubediepie with youtube
Te todos modos ibas  a perder aunque no les pidieras que te dejaran de apoyar.
when a video starts with Felix sitting, calmly, no headphones, saying "hello"

you know its gonna be a deep video
👊





Edit: HOLY CrAp 1.1k likes in ONE HOURR TY
U hv many fans from India 🇮🇳💖💖💖💖
Why t series going to win
avengers endgame thanos snaps his finger and everyones chin turns into a nutsack
are you guy dont stop you can somehave win !!!
October 5 2018-April 28 2019
The war has ended after 203 days
Maybe its time to be a little more conscious of the kids you influence and notice how jokes and rhetoric manifest themselves are real prejudices. Your vacuous  statements about media opens you up to support from alt righters or nationalists.
thia video release on my birthday
For us you will always be the hero never stop your channel 
In Swedish: För oss kommer du alltid att vara hjälten som stoppar din kanal in Japanese:  私たちにとって、あなたはいつもあなたのチャンネルをやめさせる英雄になるでしょう
It's your congratulations, you're finally Trending. Thank you YouTube for letting PewDiePie speak
It,s over
This is our endgame.
"If you have an Idea, that you genuinely think is good, don't let some idiot talk you out of it."


- Stan Lee 




Like if you respect Pewdiepie and Stan Lee.
So your ok with t series winning
Pewdiepie: Ends war

YouTube Algorithm: Time to put this on trending!
T series: We've finally won!
PewDiePie fans: Y'all hear something?
respect bro
If T Series reads this, 

Hope those dirty sacks of money are filled, 


Because thats what you  , wasnt it?
I respect you Felix but I refuse to let this meme die until you hit 100mil
#1 in trending for more than one day? Truly remarkable, and it’s an honest vid from an honest guy.
pewdiepie is died now 😂😂😂😂 

t Series number 1😏😎
Now T-Series almost hit 100 mil,and I don't really care.
finally all the ppl i know who do it r not my friends again.
Nobody:

Pewdiepie: the war has stopped
Community:  What if we fall?

Felix:  Then it shall be the noblest fall in history
Jai hind , we won , India won
y'all made it much worse, pewds wanted to help us unite and not to create real war...
When u were forward then you were flying like what .....u challenged t series and now when u know that u will lose , u r ending it ,,
What a youtuber you are 
No matter what u say ,
But when t series will reach 100M then whole world will know the truth ,
God bless you dear #Felix people are with you also because of your this respectful and caring attitude... for us you are already a No 1. We all love you #Felix... be the same always... such good hearted...
It's been a pleasure fightin with you all. From one of many 9 year old veterans.
This has gone to far
Bro good bye
Why??
Respect +
YouTube rewind: 
“I’m so proud of this community”
Everyone: cringes

PewDiePie:
“I’m so proud of this community”
Everyone: 

Edit: wow thanks for the likes guys
ｉ　ａｍ　ｆｏｒｍ　ｔｗｉｗａｎ　加油吧
He lost now he is stepping back 
#indiawinsyoutube
U can't really hate on t series. They are not an actual YouTube channel, they make Bollywood movies and are really famous in India. Just remember that
We supported you don’t give up even Zhc is supporting you
So when he says to stop, that's when it goes on trending

I see you YouTube, think you're slick
im so sorry man maybe there is something new you can do as a channel or create a new channel...idk just dont stop making videos
Finally the meme is over
well done keep it up.
Blue shirt kid?
I saw the hateful acts using your name.. It is so insane. I hope that you are doing well as this affects you as a person. Stay good bro.
👍👏👏👏
I'm crying
You Dog you Loose
Im not rasis
So when he says to stop, that's when it goes on trending

I see you YouTube, think you're slick

PS: After the first time I commented this it got almost 800 likes, then it got shadow banned . So I'll post it again so people can see, hopefully YouTube will not take it down since I guess it made too much sense.

This is round 3 by the way, round 2 got 1.7k likes. If YouTube shadow bans it, I'll Just repost and add on.

Round 4: Guess who's back...

Round 5: I think YouTube shadow banned my account so guess I'll just switch accounts lmao

If you come back and this comment isn't anywhere to be found, just wait. It will be back
T series is so big for you to win
Moment of silence
Commander you can’t surrender now we are about to win the WW3
Felix is still our number one

And don't mine T-Gay
Pewdiepie: makes a cool video
YouTube: dosent put him on trending
Pewdiepie: makes a vid ending his meme
YouTube: puts him number one on trending
dont give up yet
T-series is winning da war but
I really respect this guy
Pewds making apology videos for mistakes that are not even his fault is another level of perfection
I had a lot of respect for Felix before this video was made.

Now I have so much more.
No plzzz dont End the Subscribes!!!!! Your in the No. 2 in youtube and T-Series steal your Place 😭😭😭😭 plzzz Dont give up
Gg t series, you win. Its up to yt music now
If this doesn't make you want to sub I don't know what will lol 😂
Fine way with words
Felix: Makes this video

Media: Im gonna pretend i didnt see that
I had no idea this would have anything to do with the Christchurch shooter! That’s unspeakably bad
THIS is why I joined the 9 y/o army. The memes are great, the editing as fantastic, but THIS is what makes me want to support this channel. I really appreciate the sincerity and self-awareness Pewdiepie shows and I hope this channel succeeds (not in beating t-series, but in being what it has been and is today).  My heart goes out to the victims of hate. Hate is stupidity at its worst.
Keep it on Pew c;
youre still number one,in our hearts.
We love you Felix. Happy 9 year anniversary. 

Love, the 9-year-old family.
at least someone has the courage to admit errors and stop the world to putting dirt on his name that a boi 👍🤜🏽🤛🏽
India win 😁😁
pwedipiemotherfuckandasshole
Seriously?
This is the biggest: "This is why we can't have nice things", there ever was.
Dong give up pewdiepie plss
;)
You should congratulate t series bc your fans are better supporter than t series have but still t series won. Aur hum Indians saare moot b de na to beta behe jaaoge😘
sub to pewdiepie has ended.
should we do 'pewdiepie for president'?
Pewds: *uploads many videos everyday*

Youtube Trending: Nah


Also pewds: 


Youtube Trending: 
Less than 10 min😪😑
Dude t-series did not started this u did it and now t-series will end this .
U were the one who used inappropriate word about India, You deserve this defeat.
1 country v/s entire world and still u lost it.
Good Choice👌🏻
Loosed hope to win so end the meme
There is definitely a reason YouTube picked this video to be #1 on Trending.
Ok so i was not sickened about this until i saw the Facebook live video about this
At least you gonna be 2nd 100million
You and that geek android game Idlers And Dungeons make my day ! thank Pewdie !
ALL MEMERES RISE! WE CAN DO THIS MAKE PEWDS NUMBER #1
All he wants is respect.
I mean why not? Everyone wants respect?
I'm glad he made this video but it can't change the fact that he said disgraceful things about an entire country and it's citizens it is still unacceptable. Maybe at the start he intended it to be a joke but talking shit about an entire country is not a joke whatsoever and as an indian it's highly offensive even if you have donated money for some cause.
If T series hadn’t come this would not have happened
やっぱりpewdiepieはすごい
T Series is gae
To be honest I never heard of t series until Pewdiepie fought war w/ t series.


Edit:OMG thx for all those likes
Look at his face😂😂😂
He can cry anytime😂
:(((
Pewdiepie pls ask t-series can you be a team
Respect Felix
nine year old army,




it’s been a honor fighting with you 👊🏽
Finally you understand what is the value of India and Indian Person
So u guys were like "OMG SUBS MATTER AND PEWD AND BRO ARMY GONNA WIN" but as soon as t series beats pewdiepie by a million y'all all of a sudden like "NO SUBS DON'T MATTER, WE STILL LOVE PEWD AND HE IS NUMBER 1 IN OUR HEART" 

No that's not how it works, you can't say something then change it in under 2 weeks, what type of fucking logic is that?
you are  too late
Terrorism has nothing to do with pewdiepie

Murder has nothing to do with pewdiepie

Vandalism has nothing to do with pewdiepie
Pewdiepie: Talks about ending the Pewdiepie meme
YouTube: Puts this video on Number 1 Trending
Why are people posting memes in the comments just listen to the video honestly can someone be serious?
Its time we become 10 year olds
RIP But Atleast the 9 year old army still livrs
Cry cry cry cry cry cry.. 😂😂
:(
:(
u dum bro it was mosc not a church the is offensive for me
Im a hacker i will hack t series

Thanks for all your help pewds in being a really great support to everyone of us no matter what race we are where we are from and who we are.. But pls for one thing we the broskis, sistas and fellow 9 yrs olds would like to thank you for everything and one thing we would like to ask is to never stop making them videos! Keep on what you doing we will continue to support you! 🙇‍♂️

I am sorry PewDiePie you are the best and number 1 in the world here is a medal from me 🎖
Felix you are honestly a really genuine guy and I’m really happy for your success. But I’m glad that you decided to end the meme because it has gotten out of hand. Bro 👊
What if Pewdiepie killed the meme to make room for the meme to come back at the last minute????
gib bob n vegana

Line pe aagya saala
I absolutely love it whenever Felix speaks in a serious tone
It's just so touching and emotional
You basically just ended the growing of your career

So sad because of t series
This is over the edge man.
Not many youtubers are so nice and down to earth.
I respect you Felix.
This war made t-series and bollywood more popular. Lol.
T Series is inevitable 😔
We lost the war, we lost the dignity in the sub to pewdiepie movement but I don’t want to loose my favorite YouTuber so as sad as it is to see it go it was the right decision.
Don't mess up with INDIA....
I feel so sad people dragged something so positive into something that hurt you. I hope you stay strong.
None of this is your fault, this is people taking this too seriously, you're the one who's right here, don't feel too bad. Hang in there.
War is finally ended.............
This is very sad but necessary move
R.i.p PewDiePie don't cry🤣

HOLY COW YOU HAVE SO MANY SUBSCRUBERS!!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE HECK?!?!?!? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING YOUTUBE?!?!?!?!
i just cried

I guess the battle is finally over
Pewdiepie I hope you know that no matter what happens you will always be the number one to all of us
All we have to put are brains together and hack to t-series account and delete it. 


FOR PEWDIEPIE
the war ended
you know you didn't say it i don't even know those things
I thinks it’s unfair because India’s population is a lot bigger than USA

Edit- sorry I’m not sure if he lives in Sweeden or USA


Edit- And yes this comment is pointless don’t bully me.
Rip Pewdiepie VS T-Series
October 5 2018-April 28 2019
We had a war that lasted 203 days
I’m glad that you were able muster the courage to speak your mind about this, most YouTubers would simply hide their true thoughts the whole "Sub to Pewdiepie" thing, so it’s really impressive that you came forward to talk about it.
You know Felix is serious when the video length is not 10 mins
Pewdiepie: uploads videos that get many views everyday 

YouTube trending: no sirrr

Pewdiepie: ends sub 2 pewdiepie meme 

YouTube trending: GREAT!!
That's It. I am subscribing to you.
The “sub to PewDiePie” meme was great while it lasted and really fun before people took it way too seriously. I have nothing but respect for you and this decision, Felix. ♥️✌🏽
We love you
Sala fattu madarchod bhosdi ke randi ki aulad t-series ko harane chala tha khud  sala Dar ke Bhag Gaya T-Series tera baap hai bhosdi ke tu Gandu video banane wala Chala Hai T-series jaisa Bada company ko Takkar dene Tere gaand Mein Sarso ka tel lagakar Pele ga T-Series Yaad rakhega Jindagi Bhar Jitna Tera subscriber Nahin Hai usse jyada to hamare Yahan bacche a Roj net chalate Hain
Please stay for us.

New meme, unsubscribe from 5-minute crafts.
Don't mess with us.. that's call Indian

Wtf bro.
Yes sir
T-SERIES may have won the war

But Pewdipie won our hearts❤
Remember lads

You criticize indians now see our unity
I am wondering how much money was wasted for pewdiepie promotions... Damn!!!
Makes important and serious video about ending Pewds vs T Series 

Gets first on trending for the first time in months

Rip
Uu have started the war T series ended ....
You can’t beat a scamming Indian that has sub bot
Pewds: *uploads many videos everday*

Youtube Trending: Nah




Also pewds: 

Youtube Trending: 
you realise that we won't shut up until you win do you?
Endgame
You Are Welcome Pew 👊
Pewdiepie:*Makes serious video*


Youtube: Now you can trend.




Seriously why you come here.
Nobody here in New Zealand blames you or associates you with the shooter
PewDiePie it has been a long journey i watched you for a long period of time and loved your content and I just want to tell you that you are still #1 in everyone's heart. Thank you
This ended the Third World War
its just sad that pewds lost and at the same time i lost my friendship with my bestfriend 😪
Fat gayi uski🤣🤣🤣🤣
love when we get to see felix's serious side
Why pewdiepie why 

Me:bye pewdiepie crying 😢
He ish sho humblee
You will always be the god of youtube coz T-series is nonsense.
No It shall go on
WE LOVE YOU 3000
I am from Indonesian
§4 rip
But You know Dumb Who Is the real Champions..........  T SERIES
don t give up
Thankgod we have someone like Pewdipie on YouTube
Hi Pewds... You just showed the world how genuine a person you are and so pure at heart.. Sadly many illiterates and uneducated people in India and even some of the Indian Youtubers still cannot understand the meaning of memes and their purpose.. Love from India <3
I'm still fighting.
So late to this as i've been off youtube for a bit and was not even aware that pewdiepie had been targeted in the Christchurch attacks, it wasn't something they seemed to mention much on tv as i dunno..maybe the reporters were aware that it wasn't actually an important part of the entire situation. It makes me pissed off that the media has clung to this like everything else and tried to spin it into something it's not, something that honestly has nothing to do with Christchurch or those involved. I even read that some idiot considers this a 'gateway' channel to radicalization 'due to the viewers being 9 yrs old' what a great example of modern media just being shit at their jobs. Sad to see such a thing associated with something that was supposed to be fun and for it being linked to Felix as a person, but will always be here to support the Army!
Bhag bhenchod
He protecc
He atacc
But Most Importantly
The War Is Over We No Longer Have To Fight Bacc
But pewdiepie we al followers to you Will never stop your chanel and even you are the best
Guys, we fought hard. Don’t let this happen again. T-Series may win, but we have worked so hard for Felix it’s time to stop before it gets worse. Obviously T doesn’t deserve to win but what happens, happens. You have won in our  hearts Pewds.




We love you Felix ❤️ -The bro’s since the beginning
What a man...
World War III




Has ended
The thing I like about this guy is that he still remains humble🔥💯🐐
We will be okay.you can rest now.....................love you 3000
Now I have subscribed to u
He know he is losing
