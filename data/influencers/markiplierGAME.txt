mark and ethan: *doing master and slave roleplay*
markiplier makes pinatas. every one makes a pinata and sees which ones strongest.
Why does Ethan look like he should be leading a cult? I mean the blindfold and his outfit just reminds me of what I invision as a cult leader.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No one:
Not a single soul:
Mark: I GREW UP POOR AND WIPED MY ASS WITH THE DRY LEAVES OF THE PLANTS WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WATER
What if they sold their shirts and autographed them for charity...
mark grew up poor but now hes a man with 5 OVENS
ooh, they're all wearing sweatpants ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I don't think anyone would do a master-slave role play





Exept mark and Ethan
12:30

I can‚Äôt be the only one that was just mesmerized by the clock in the back, right?
Every Markiplier Makes:

Mark: I grew up poor.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
Amy: your all dying that‚Äôs good 
Mark: we‚Äôre dying?
Ethan: finally  
Mood
"Do you want me to put the gloves on you, M A S T E R ?"


Me: .- Spits out water -.
Tyler: You Mark; have a large soul~
Ethan: And; A medium d--k

I liked Ethan's the best, honestly. But green is my favorite color so I'm biased.
The instructions of tie die is friendship!
Me: (animates all day)
Yah I should probably go get some of those
3:35 in the distance you can hear a small Irish voice across the ocean...

‚ÄúLAUGH!!!‚Äù

nearly 2k likes wow didnt think that was gonna happen üëå
It looked someone had a nose bleed on tylers shirt üòÇ
Mark's potential height strikes fear in the hearts of humanity, but fortunately for all that exists, he's a smol bean.
Ethan: ‚ÄúDo you want me to put on the gloves for you... M A S T E R? ‚Äú
Mark: PFFT-
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Not a single soul in the universe:

Life's a process

Can' You Play Don't Escape 4
Again Please
The last video: An amazing and beautiful work of art that probably took several months to make, telling a powerful story about family, love, and sacrifice

Mark in this video: COCK BAGUETTES-
A couple days ago: huge bombshell on Darkiplier's backstory

Now: this
I imagine Mark speaking french in France.
Mark: Bonjour
French Guy: Bonjour.
Mark: on aime baguet
French Guy: o... Ouais ?

Geometry dash: C U M   B U C K E T S
Sees Notification of Markiplier plays Geometry Dash

OH SH*T!!!! HE'S DOING IT!!! 
Clicks video instantly
MARK!!!! There are fanmade levels for you in Geometry Dash! One of them even got rated (which is a huge honor, tbh). MAKE A SERIES ON THIS GAME PLEASE
oh, nice thumbnail.





but why yuri's eyes?
He's back, Chica, you can stop filling in for him
9:07 That made me laugh hard
Me: *sees geometry dash*
Oh boy, Mark... Get ready to rage...
In fingerdash, the lyrics are... :
"Trump nuggets
Feed on the weed
Prepare to die immediately
Oh, oh, oh, oh"
That wasn't Geometry dash in the makeup video! That was The Impossible Game.
I'm dying.. Why does everyone think fingerdash is the hardest level
*Mark Playing Geometry Dash 
Me : Took off my earphone away

Now i feel like Beethoven while seeing you sing Mark XD
"This game is not fair."
.
.
.
0:33 that game isn't geometry dash mark.. 
It's the 
spiritual predecessor called "impossible game"
When mark doesn‚Äôt look, he is #1 but when he looks, he is #2
Markiplier: releases DAMIEN
Also Mark: P A M   B A G U E T T E
"Baguettes, oi....Eiffel tower."


I'm dying- üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Everyone : Not emotionally prepared for anything

Mark : HEY GUESS WHAT
Wait...on the last episode of Who Killed Markiplier the mirror shattered. Is THIS what was happening behind the mirror? I...I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?
Pamela's credit: Official headshot
Mark's credit as Damien: Selfie in a bathroom with a Chica shirt
Fun fact: The ending scene is a subtle allusion to one of Mark's first fan games, where he found himself drowning underwater at the start of the game.
Me: Sees title

Me: MaTpAt GeT yOuR bUtT oVeR hErE rIgHt NoW
How confused do you want your fans to be?
Markiplier: yEs
Wait a minute I think I got some foreshadowing
Mark made a vid called ‚Äúgo back to sleep‚Äù, referencing Damien and Mark‚Äôs conversation
Then we‚Äôve got ‚Äúerror‚Äù, where Mark is just glitching the fUck out
Then ‚Äúmy face exploded...‚Äù, possibly referencing how the mangled Damien looked like its face exploded
And finally ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired...‚Äù which is obviously Damien or Celine being worn out.
A short while after ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired‚Äù was posted, this was posted.
Is Damien becoming Darkiplier like the colonel who became Wilford?
That would surely make him villainous
15:20 You...You should have gone for the head...


15:28 Celine: surprised pikachu face
The name Darkiplier makes sense now.
Damien + Markiplier
The Markiplier Cinematic Universe is one of the most promising things about the coming decade. I honestly think that the culmination of these videos should be an actual feature length movie.
At 9:55 you can hear Wilford saying "Don't let anyone tell you that you're crazy". Maybe it means something but I honestly don't know what....
So Damien became darkiplier and he's technically the good guy I am so confused....... But that's what makes a great story all of Mark stories leaves you with questions and leaves you wanting more thank you Mark this was amazing
Me: cliks on this video
        "oh what a lovely game"
        "why no facecam Mark?" 
        "wait Mark and Pam voice in this? Coooool"
        "huh, the title looks a bit darkiplier-y"
        "oh, this is a horror game"
        "wait a sec... the girl name is Celine and the guy is Damien..."
        "oooooh, this is a darkiplier story..."
Conclusion: I¬¥m dumb
oh, the train, how long were we stuck in the snow for?
Mark: Uploads Damien





3 days later






Also Mark: gEomETrY dAsH pLaYeD bY tRaSh
Hey, SOME DOUCHE was part of this! Man, I love that guy!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Mark is so cool
But Damien is too.
The faint piano in the background at the end always gets me
Is Celine holding Damien hostage in a wintry world of her own creation?
MARK

IT‚ÄôS OK

WE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT VIDEOS

YOUR HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT

GO TO BED
throws him a blanket SLEEP MY CHILD
"I'm tired" UH HUH DAMIEN
Day 7 with no new markilpier content, my oxygen supply is running low. I can feel the crushing despair
furiously re-contextualises everything said in this video after watching Damien
Mark: sleeps for the first time in decades

Fans: "now we wait"
Mark: takes a very long nap 
Me: watches markiplier fnaf
Mark:i will upload videos in less than a week i promise
1 week later
Me: R.I.P. Markiplier roll the mark crying copilation
Mark: "No more than a week"
Me: * Looks at video post date *
Me: * Looks date (5/8) * "DUDE" TTnTT
i miss u * much tears *
"It's not an exile it's just Purgatory"
I kinda feel like Purgatory is worse...
Mark: I‚Äôm kind of tir-
Me: GO. TO. BED.
All I have to say Mark is...








THERE IS A NEW FRAN BOW GAME CALLED Little Misfortune its a demo at the moment though
You just take it easy. We'll wait. Your health is top priority, you don't need to do anything taxing until you're good, heck, take an extended break just in case!
mark: goes to sleep

me: ok so im gonna sit here and im gonna wait

         me:*waits 2 weeks and still waiting to this day*

           me:worth it
Mark:"I am going to be in a purgatory for a week".
Literally after a week he posts Damien who was blocked in a purgatory.
Mark:"I am going to sleep".
The title of this video "i am tired".
Some of the main words wich Damien to himself in "Damien". Coincidence?
And if u don't know what am i talking about see the next video he posted.
Mark: I'm tired...

Me and most of everybody every day: Same.
Mark: yeh I‚Äôm tired...
One week later
DAMIAN PREMIERING IN 20 HOURS
Me: Wtf?
Saying you're tired and then releasing Damien makes me way too suspicious over nothing, thanks. (Jk much love, good job on the latest project)
Day 11 without Markiplier videos: I watched the entire Prop Hunt playlist in about a day time.

P.S.: what happened to Prop Hunt?
Just came from "DAMIEN"

Mark: I'm in purgatory
Me:.... OH YEAH! hint hint hint hint
Amy, an actual artist: ...lookin good guys!...
You can tell Tyler is naturally an artist. He only takes up 10% of the entire page.
Mark's Sandy Cheeks was literally just Homer Simpson as a velociraptor.
Tyler: *explains in depth in artistic language the hidden meaning of each piece while firmly grasping air
Ethan: Well I uh- you see..
Mark: I- um- poverty and squares
Markiplier Makes: Origami

MAKE IT HAPPEN PLZ!!
LIKE SO HE CAN SEE!
12:51
Mark: I kind of forgot what a dog looks like.
...
...
...
Chika- Am i a joke to you.
We‚Äôre drawing Gir
Me: has drawn Gir multiple times* this should be easy for them
Tyler: draws Zim
Ethan in yellow: SpongeBob
Tyler in pink: Patrick
Mark in white: Sandy
why is Ethans first drawing lowkey really good
Me: watching video.. listening to critiques.. 
Video recorder: zooms in on markiplier nude poster.. 19:22
me: goes back rewinds.. spams pause play to get exact moment..
me: wtf..
Me: scrolls thru comments.. no one? No??
K.
19:19 I love how the camera man's like, "Holdup, let's talk about this."
Mark: **owns two dogs
Also mark: **forgets what a dog looks like
Stupid Ethan! You make me look bad!

BOOGA BOOGA BOO
Ethan's drawing of Johnny Bravo looked like Sans cosplaying Johnny Bravo üòÇ
No one:
Absolutely No one:
Not a single soul:


Mark: 
Amy: Kim Possible
Mark: I didn‚Äôt watch that show, I was too poor
Me: Why did I laugh so much?
Anyone burst out singing the Kim Possible Theme Song when she came up?
No, just me?
okay...
Kind of shocked Ethan didn't win more rounds. We need an impartial judge!
DOUBLE D HAS AN ORANGE SHIRT ???? SINCE WHEN
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make mistakes, just happy little accidents‚Äù - Bob Ross
Lixian declaring bankruptcy was such a power move.
Wade: *exist*


Mark: *distressed southern screaming*
It actually took me 20 fucking minutes just to realize that lixian is actually a person playing with them and not a bot like Barbara xD wtf that dude's so calm and quiet
So we're all just gonna ignore 6:05?
mark: *declines* you won't do it again
wade: *does it again*
mark: OH GOD PLEASE NO
me: *dies of laughter*
41:16 
Wade be like: Dormammu, I've come to bargain
40:15

"Markimoo, i have come to bargain".
Mark reacting to his own joke "Southern Aggression" is everything
Bob every video ever: "YOU'RE A GODDAMN WIZARD!"
Lixian: A Broke Monopoly God.
Bob: Surprisingly okay with this.
Mark: The Turd King. (But needs help very badly.)
Wade: Still salty and VERY stubborn.
Lixian is like the new Barbara...





Now we just wait for an epic animated battle to be made
this is probably the weirdest game of monopoly i've seen since ever
"I just--when you say something mean, I assume it's about me." - Wade, 2019
Basically the whole Monopoly game:

S E L F D E S T R U C T
I think the most comedic thing about the whole trade segment is how swiftly the first conversation went with nobody talking over each other. Then the second one was overlapping conversation hell. Then the third was half talking and half barely coherent screaming.

‚ÄúEverything my properties touches is your kingdom.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hate you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are-‚Äú ‚ÄúI SWEAR-‚Äú ‚Äúthe one-‚Äú ‚ÄúTO GOD‚Äù ‚Äúthe only-‚Äù ‚ÄúWADE‚Äù

‚ÄúMy golden gopher-‚Äù
Question of the day
Mark: If I get southern when I'm angry, is that southern agression? 
Bob: Yes
Mark: Smiles deeply into the camera
I think Wade would had bankrupt himself if Lixian didn't. Lixian was supposed to win, that's the only way it should've ended. 
I'm in the wrong universe
"You're my only hope" - proceeds to make a half-hour long trade giving up everything
Lixian is either gonna get fired or never play a game with them anymore because of this... Also, can Mark and Bob play with Gar, Molly, Dan and Patrick!

Alternate Title: Getting Over it with Bennett: The Sequel
Next time, play the actual Board Game. I wanna see who flips the table
Cate: We can escape earth.
Title: Don't Escape
. . . something's not right here.
i've rewatched this 6 times because no new videos comes out and it's still pretty good. If I have to wait a month til
 part 3 then i'll wait. Rest and get better mark 
:3
Mark 100 IQ: Drink the water
Mark 200 IQ: Spray the water
Mark 1,000 IQ: Absorb the water
Marks morals: spend 60 minutes burying his neighbors wife,doesn't spend 20 minutes opening a can of food for an orphan child.

Edit: Thx for 100 likes!
Marrkkkkkk are you gonna finish this game??? I hope you are able to!
Mark: "Im a kind person"


Meanwhile also Mark 3 minutes ago: "can i shoot that person?"
And IF u conbind water sparyer and the lighter with Duct tape u get a empty flamethrower like so mark can get his flamethrower
Game: "Its Locked"
Mark: "Well not from me"
Uses Crowbar
Mark: Heh Heh He


Basically mark if he sees anything locked.
Who else would like Mark to play this a few days in a row or every other day; because I do ?!?
10-Year-Old: Makes echo in cave and thinks its funny
Mark: Alright freak, you weirdo
i loved the end dialogue between Barry and Cody tho.

‚ÄúBarry i‚Äôm bored. can we play something?‚Äù
‚Äúsure. what do u want to do?‚Äù
‚Äúi spy with my little eye. i‚Äôll go first!‚Äù
‚Äúgo ahead.‚Äù
‚Äúi spy with my little eye something scary.‚Äù
‚ÄúCate.‚Äù 

HA!
When are we going to see part3?...hope it‚Äôs soon thanks
Is he gonna do a part 3 or is it a case of waiting for it to be realeased before he can play it or is it a case of not enough veiws to keep the series going? 

Honestly I'm hoping it continues.
Day 1:
Bug Swarm 
Giant Spiders 
Toxic Gas Cloud

Day 2: 
Heat Wave
Blizzard 

Day 3:
Killer Gang
???
(???)

Day 4:
???
???
Part 3 plz, we need a part 3. Loike if u agree!
So I found out that there is a randomized factor for each day, as there can be spiders, locusts, or a toxic cloud on the 1st day, on the 2nd day there can be a blizzard instead of a heat wave, which is what the coats and blankets were for
There must be some kind of way out of here, said the joker to the thief... Nice reference script wielder...
This man just lost everything! Because I ransacked his house!
I will wait for next video even if it take 3-4 month :)
DARKIPLIER IS GON RETURN MARK MY WORDS
i just realized the pun of mark my words
Hi Mark, developer of Species ALRE here. I'm incredibly stoked that you played our game: I've watched a fair number of your video's over the years!

Sorry about the gene editor, I accidentally released a version (12.0.5) that broke the up/down buttons. I fixed that in 12.0.6, so it should be quite a bit easier to design your own creatures. Then you can set them as the Target in the nursery or just gene splice them into real creatures to get live specimens.

Alternatively, you can use "Initialise Random" on the new world page to gain access to a plethora of abominations of nature! :)

It's just a shame you didn't notice the temperature and water-level controls, I was looking forward to watching you cleanse the world with fire and flood.
"Don't you look at me!"
"Don't you look at me!!"
"DON'T YOU LOOK AT MEEE!!!!"
-What Mark yells in the bedroom.
‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU?? WHAT ARE YOU, YOU FREAK?‚Äù 

god when he made me
"this is our baby"

"OUR BABY HAS HORNS, I'MA CALL HIM HORNY"

God: creates beautiful animals and plants

Mark: ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù
That's why god is invisible, so we can't look at him
My mother seeing me for the first time after giving birth to me:

‚ÄúWhat is that? (Looks closer). WHAT IS THAT?!?!‚Äù
Mark: look at my babies

Science expert: oh, oh Jesus. Somebody get me a trashcan. Anyways, Mark, what have you created?

Mark: thicc babies

Science expert: what did you do to them?

Mark: I flooded them with radiation

Science Expert: radiation. Hmm. Okay... And how do you think that affected them? Did it only affect them a little or did it affect them immensely?

Mark: 
Mark- DON'T . LOOK . AT . ME .


Also Mark- Zooms into his baby's face
‚ÄúI have a big head and little arms and I don‚Äôt think you thought this through master...master?‚Äù
Mark: WTF ARE YOU!!!
19:25 I think Anti and Dark are fighting again but Mark just doesn't know.
Or doesn't care.
...now in my head, I picture God having the exact same attitude towards the human race. Thank you, good sir.
When 19:22 happens:
"OH MY GOD. OKAY, ITS HAPPENING. EVERYBODY STAY CALM!"
In this video, Mark finds out that radiation actually kills things
Jack - a real proud dad
Mark - 
DONT YOU LOOK AT ME!!
You are slowing evolving them into SCP-173s mark... Good job.
Science expert:
So what branch of science do you specialize in?

Mark: Yes
19:22 No need to whisper, Dark. It's not like we're in a library or anything
I think this game creates creatures for horror games...
Mark: My face exploded
Translation: I laughed so hard my tooth eroded my gum
Guy: How many times have you went to the hospital?



Mark: 
Mark: Removes wisdom tooth

Wisdom tooth: Am I a joke to you?
Mark:I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôll get better

Wisdom tooth: FLINT LOCKWOOD
Doctor: Was it worth it? The try not to laugh challenge?

Mark: Yes

Doctor: What did it cost?

Mark: Everything...
Dammit mark! Again! How many times are you gonna almost die!?
"I noticed some intense pain in this section of my jaw" That would be a problem, yes.
As a big fan, and currently employed as a pharmacy technician,  just wanted you to know the the antibiotics can cause diarrhea due to them killing off probiotics in your system. I hope you don't have to go through anymore health issues anytime soon.

Ps... I watch your videos when I'm sick to feel better. You are a wonderful human and a very funny guy.  Keep up the good work, keep making people smile.
Me: Mom, my face exploded

My Mom: You still have to go to school

Me: Dang it
Nobody:

Mark: My face exploded...

(Get better soon MarküíñüíØ)
‚ÄúMy doctor told me not to laugh, but I should be fine‚Äù -last month
‚ÄúMy Face exploded‚Äù - now.
This is Mark. Mark uses Oral-B. He has had both of his wisdom teeth infected and removed, followed by a gum infection. Use Colgate kids
Doctors: it‚Äôll be fine! Nothing will go wrong! 

Me: have you seen Mark‚Äôs video, sir?!
I wish you can be good after this , your health is first,take your time to relax ,we are here, love you .üíü
Hey guys, how many times you have been in hospital?



mark:

SML: 
doctor :don't do anything with your jaw 
mark: does a try not to laugh challenge 
the doctor : am i a joke to you
When I am looking straight at you I can actually see the swelling 1:06
Mark: why no warnings


Guy: I called you and u didn‚Äôt answer 

Mark:oops
DENTIST: Removes Marks wisdom tooth. 
Wisdom Tooth: You will soon regret this.
Mark: My face Exploded
I love how his titles for these videos are very creative and over the top XD bit worrisome though
The fact that the audio comes from a game of Uno just shows that animators can do anything
Who else actually WATCHES marks vids and already knew this was a game of uno
i love the face mark makes when he looks under barbara skirt. 

2:59
Possibly my favourite thing here is how nonchalant everyone is about being slashed, stabbed and overall maimed.
was that Kirito's sword?

Is thAT A JOJO REFENCE.
Top ten characters who can defeat Thanos

Number one: Barbara
1:37 holy god that instant replay though.. IT BROKE ON A SINGLE HAIR üò®
Anyone notice that Barb‚Äôs massive sword was actually Kirito‚Äôs from Sword Art Online??????
And the Jojo continue meme.
These animators know their anime! üíö
Wade got his hand of cards taken by Barbara 
Animators: wade gets his hand cut off 


they are so smart likes this auto actually came from the game!
3:56
It was at this moment that Wade knew: He Fucked Up.
When you remember this is really just 3 guys playing cards with an NPC üòÇ
come on, they couldn't at least added wage screaming at barba.
Impressive that someone could take lines from UNO and turn it into a battle arena experience. Well Done.
SAO sword?

Is tHat A mOThErfUckINg JojO RefERenCe?!?
Not that anybody will care but my Grandma's name is Barbara.
After reading the comments I realized this was just a game of uno...
Markiplier is not just a legend he is a god among men
This is a very creative use of random UNO audio clips.
I can't believe this was actually just a game of UNO..

But man, can we just appreciate Barbara's character design? That was mwuah perfect
When your so much of a web u recognized the sword Barbra used in 3:09 its from sao and called ‚Äúthe elucidater‚Äù and one of Kiritos main weapons
I just witnessed 2 grown men slap each other while 1 slaps himself
No one:

Mark: Now when I was a child we couldn't afford...
Mark and Tyler fighting and Ethan hitting himself is basically what their collective friendship is in a nutshell
In highschool, 
Mark: Class clown, Ethans bestfriend.. And only friend.

Tyler: Jock, golden boy.

Ethan: The kid that sits at the back and watching birds fly around outside and is completely oblivious to everything.

I've come to the realization that Mark, Ethan, and Tyler are literally me and my friends when we try to do a group project or anything involving teamwork.

Mom: quietly exits room

Ah shit, here we go again...
mark will never be a "fake gamer" this man still had the nerve to play baldi's basics after beating the all questions wrong ending
edit:this is my most liked comment
someone: slaps ruler on hand

mark: ptsd flashbacks
This comment could‚Äôve been an Avengers: Endgame spoiler!
Careful on your journeys in the comment section..

Deja Vu.

I have been in this place before.
"I'm just gonna drop this metal bar, and take this rock"
... And that's how people die in this game üòÇüòÇ
Game: The metal bars only kept 10 out of 32 locust out

Mark: That‚Äôs fine. Metal bars are best
Mark: "you know I'm not one to rush into danger"
Me: PTSD montage of everytime mark has rushed into danger while mister blue sky plays
"Ah dammit, I'm out of slaves."
Just wait till he realizes there's TWO rocks in the game.
The editing is spot on! Lixian does an awesome job!



Edit: woah Jesus! Thanks for al the likes I‚Äôve never had so many before!
Don't Escape 4 has different catastrophe in the first day, which is quite interesting. Mark gets somekind of giant bugs, while I get toxic cloud in the first day. It seems there are more than those I've seen in the game.

Pretty sure that was a Hitchhiker's Guide reference.
"Myself, I'd trust him until the end of time."
"When's that?"
"About twelve minutes."
(on Thursday, of course)
"Oh! It's an elevator! I thought it was just a weird metal box."

You just described an elevator, Mark.

Thanks for all the likes this is the most I've ever gotten
What each one contributed to the overall project in this episode.
Mark: the Iron Empire
Bob: consolidation.
Wade: "I took a piss in mah vibrator"
Bob the Communist
Mark the Capitalist
Wade the Insane Asylum Inmate
Wtf Wade. I‚Äôm still dying from that one quote I TOOK A PISS IN MAH VIBRATOR
In this episode of Satisfactory, Mark prepares the murder of his fellow gamers, PissPlates and Consolidation
infernal screaming 
‚ÄúI think Wade found the edge‚Äù
I swear these Satisfactory videos are the best. They are the absolute funniest videos. Thank you 3 for streaming these gems.
You have no idea how many times I've rewatched this video just for "I TOOK A PISS IN MAH V I B R A T O R" and Bob's Five-Year Consolidation Plan.

You have no idea.
Summary-
Mark-raging at Wade
Wade- well no one knows what Wade is doing honestly 
Bob- working......in circles
Five minutes in, and everyone is losing their minds. I love it, I can't stop laughing!üòÜüòÜ
[closeup of alien doggo]
Evil Bob: I'M BUILDING A FORTRESS
Did I just watch Mark do all the work and Bob and Wade claim credit for it?
I'm just waiting for Mark to quietly build his own base on the other side of the map. Complete with walls and security to protect his materials and keep his progress secret.
18:45
Mark: * Realizes his mistake*
Mark:* Wails his tiny fists in anger*
Two minutes into the video:
I took a piss in mah vibrator.

I don't know what I expected, really...
GUYS!!!! BOB'S A COMMUNIST!!!
I knew consolidation sounded a little too close to the ultimate comrade.
Hey Mark, if you do Logistics Mk. 3 then Bob's consolidation will make you guys alot of materials.
All you need to do is upgrade the conveyer belts so that they go faster.
If you guys get enough aliens carcasses you guys can make a gun 


Like so mark can read
"could you make some more iron plates? I'm having a really hard time robbing you guys. You got any more iron plates i could steal?"- Wade 2019
if you deconstruct Bob's base, if you inventory is full, it drops into storage crates smaller than the mergers.
Bob did say he wanted to consolidate everything, start with his base.
In this episode Mark slowly turns into Lemongrab
Mark: Uh, how do I enter Big Picture mode?

Absolutely no one:

Mark: 
11:59 Bob's laughs matched the character so perfectly im shook
When things are tough/not going their way
Mark: No, wait, how, no, no!
Bob: Hey, lets talk about this...
Wade: AAAAHHHHHHHH
Why was the Chicken Suit guy the perfect avatar for Wade?
Jack: speed is key

Mark: SPOOOOOOD!
If mark says you run for your life:

Run first, ask questions later
"You won't. No balls"

This has pretty much become my catch phrase when I play anything.
Bob: How many boxes did Mark hit?
Mark: yes
Makr‚Äôs pros:

Handsome 
Has friends
Money
Good YouTube channel 

Cons:
BOXES
Everyone : played this game back in 2013
Mark : HELLO GUYS ITS 2019 AND IM PLAYING SPEEDRUNNERS HEHEHEHEHE
MARK DID YOU GET THE INVITE..... 
MARK WE SENT A INVITE 
mark: kill me now
I still will never forget that legendary moment when wade ran the wrong way which resulted in bob almost passing out laughing...

Best moment in youtube history lmao
Goals
Wade - "Hey, I didn't die first!"
Remember when Wade ran the wrong way in the other direction? 

Pepperidge Farm remembers ü§£üòÇ
Everyone: makes normal reference to Cars in a form of meme.

Mark: I aM SPOOD
29:20 Mark: Please have mercy on my soul
Wade: DROPS NUKE
The SPOOD part made me laugh so hard my dad came to me complaining about the noise
Wade: Dont you have a skin in this game? Like warfstache or something

Mark: AH its gone forever!




Me: But if mark IS warfstache...............
Oh god
Bob: Bot makes us look absolutely terrible.

Wade: At least you guys can leave the starting line...

18:19 I guess you could say that Wade dropped some BAWKSes

This entire video

Two men trying to sell crack and not have a mental breakdown.
It was so funny when Jimmy was giving him directions on how to use buttons in the game, with totally bogus biology.
52:25 
Jimmy: "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLS YOU!"

I love Stan and Jimmy so much X'D
Please keep this a running series, I need weekly episodes to stay hydrated.
"sells" crack to Mel
5mins later gets punched in face by Mel while he runs away super fast
Immediately Jimmy: HE RUNS LIKE HE'S ON CRACK!
That's what you call a "true comedian" people.
Jimmy: you need to start taking control-

[car flips over almost killing both of them]

Jimmy: -taking control of your life!
I came for Stan, but stayed for Friendly J.
"Do I seem like a weird person to you Jimmy?"
...
"YES"
Mark, PLEASE make this a regular series. This is my absolute favorite thing you've done on the channel in a long time.
Jimmy and Stan friendship is the best thing that happened to this world
So if Mark has Darkiplier does that mean Stan has Stan the Coffee Man anytime he takes Oxy?
Mark: jImMyY???

Jimmy: sweating and crying trying to hide

Mark: jImMy I SmeLl YoU
I'm absolutely in love with these videos. I hope they continue üòÅüòÇ
