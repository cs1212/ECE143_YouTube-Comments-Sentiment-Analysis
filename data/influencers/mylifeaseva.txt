* spotted a spider *
* Screaming *
* Maya spraying it *
Eva - Maya it's dry shampoo !!
Me : 😂😂
eva: cleans her room
also eva: immediately buys new stuff to put in the room
Your hoarding room is like that one chair everyone has in their room..
I love how you donated to the Great Barrier Reef because I live in Australia and it is cool to see that people from around the world are helping us to restore our amazing landmark
witnesses prefers to stay anonymous 

Every one: hi Brent
“Now we just have to do the rest of the house” 
-Eva

🤦🏼‍♀️
I loved how your sister was so shady and not letting you keep trash 😂😂
Also I loved your super chill outfit at the end 😍
The person who prefers to be anonymous is Brent. We all know it
Me: gets motivated to clean room
           Walks into room
Me:leaves the room
I am SO glad a big YouTuber like her is ACTUALLY trying to help earth
🙂🙂
So, i've seen the video...





Now it's time for me to do it myself.
When you were about to drop the candle my heart drop
Who else LOVES Eva?!?


p.s I'm a small youtuber :)
You should do boyfriend rates my outfit. Please
11:13 … that gave me so much anxiety
THE TISSUE WITH LIPSTICK STAINS REPRESENTS ME IN AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL
I can’t wait to have my own Hoarding Room when I grow up
Hey Eva. Thank you so much. I come from Germany and i have learned englisch with you. In my speaking test I've got 28 out of 30 points. You make so marvellous videos. Go on and wish me luck for my final writing exams please👑
With a lot of hugs
Rebecca :)
the room before is what my bedroom currently looks like.
anonymous person:
me: ITS OBVIOUSLY BRENTTTTT
witness wants to be anonymous

Shows Brent's hair
The anonymous person: 
The Fandom: OMG IT’S BRENT!!!
Eva: 🤫😂
Eva i love your videos. You're such an inspire person. You are so funny and a really good Idol! i'm proud to be a part of your army. 
Btw #teamBreva ❤💕😇
Eva:witness wants to be blurred out 
Blurred face:
Me:hi Brent
Everyone else:it's obviously Brent Rivera
I was honestly expecting a bigger mess, I bet Eva is just one of those people that understands the mess lol...
When Eva almost dropped the candle at home goods I felt my heart drop like I was the one dropping it 😂
I love how you donate the money you make from poshmark to saving the environment
Ava you kinda sound like a grandma calling us snicsles
I feel like my sister would make me do this lol 😂 😂 😂 😂
So I bought your book and I am in love with it and it is just so helpful😊
I’m glad you did this video also the message to be less wasteful💗😇
The reason why your smoke alarms are going off is because your power is low. Try unplugging unnecessary things. Trust me, I had this problem a few days ago.
Ik I’m late but...MY POTATO LOVE TO GO ON LONG WALKS
Dude smoke detectors take batteries even if they’re connected to electricity. In case your power goes out. You just need to replace the battery.
grrrr I wish poshmark shipped outside the us bc as an Australian i’m legit dying
EVA INSPIRED ME TO MAKE QUALITY CONTENT VIDEOS❤️
AND THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE IM GOING TO MAKE IT
👇🏽
i legit had a anxiety attack when she almost dropped the candle
Mine took a two days😂🤣
The 327 people who disliked obviously don’t know what real content is.
I can relate so much, on a personal level 



My room looks like that aLl tHe TiMe
"That goes under, should've never bought it" 😂😅
1like = 1 thing cleaned up in Eva’s hoarding room 
⬇️
She makes my day so much happier like for real ❤️🤪
11:04
“That’s Disgusting”
Me: “it’s...Beautiful!!!”
Lmao
Eva And Maya are sibling goals 😍
The first pic of final product made me scream like a little BOY and I think you all know boys scream lighter then girls. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is giving me gabbie hanna vibes and I love it
I had a electrical fire alarm and I ended up finding out there was a battery powered one near the electric one.
This is my room HAHA this so funny. I love you so much and your channel
My hoarding room is my bedroom LOL
Omg this inspired me to clean my hoarding room aka my bedroom lmao







Sub to me let’s be YouTube friends
Who wants Eva to do the I eat everything the person infront of me orders for 24 hours challenge? Like this comment!
Anyone notice that RemiAshten has that same wallpaper!
Most smoke alarms have backup batteries if they are hard wired to the power in the house. They have them just in case the power goes out. They will still beep if the backup battery is dead but the power works so I'd still try to see if there is a gap for a battery in the alarm.
My name is miah too... but we probably have different spellings❤️❤️❤️😂
the anomonus is Brent skskks 😂😂 it looks like him 😩✌🏻💕
this is how many people love eva ❤️

👇🏻

Also I’m such a perfectionist that this would kill me inside to have this room
I love Eva! I'm always looking forward to it from Japan!
My room is lowkey like that rn lol

The person who wants to remain "anonymous" is obviously Brent
Eva! You know we need an update video, in true TLC spirit.

I wish I was this motivated to clean my room😂💗
I love this video! And I love that u encompassed the effects of the environment in here. I noticed that u said u had to throw away a lot of the PR packages, could u recycle it bc it would most likely go w paper products?
Honestly gotta thank Eva for bringing a family to just always make me smile. So thank you Eva! You mean the world to me!

Thank you for the message at the end of this video!! it is so often left out but so so important
I'm sure lots of people would have commented this already, but even though the alarm is in the ceiling attached to wires, it still has batteries. Yeah, it's stupid... I had the same problem for a long time until I finally asked my mom "WHY WON'T IT STOP". :c
PS. You and Maya look so beautiful <3
Smoke alarm still has backup batteries
I’m so proud! It’s so hard to clean super messy rooms but when it’s done it’s so satisfying how clean it is💕❤️

The room Already looked kinda modern aesthetic because of the white theme but it looked so much cuter after
The beeping noises are friken ghosts
My room has never gone that dirty.
Is it just me that is lowkey upset that Adam and Eva aren’t together anymore
11:14 when Eva almost dropped that candle my heart dropped!!!  Sent my enxiety through the roof! 
Also anyone want to be YouTube friends?  I make videos and I'm just starting out so any support would be really appreciated.💛💛

you can spray some compressed air into the smoke detector to get out any cobwebs and dust and that can also stop the beeping noise.

Press the button on the smoke alarm it will beep louder and fast for a couple of seconds and then stop 🥰 love you
your hair looks so good 💜
The anonymous person is Brent we can all see his big hair and lifeguard jacket.
I miss Eva's skits ;c
Even though it’s a teeny bit unsanitary how she reuses her lipstick wipe , I literally have 2 different wipes I always reuse until they’re full of concealer and eyebrow pomade 😂
My room has been that way awhile ago
My room has been that messy so i know how good it feels when its all cleand out
Eva or Friend: I want everything already. 
Literally me every time I go to the mall🛒 LOL
MY POTATO LOVES TO GO ON LONG WALKS
Your mains powered smoke detector still has a battery in case the power goes out. The beeping means you need to change the battery. Love this video, I also have a hoarding room and hopefully one day I'll also organise it!

You should start a series where you clean one room in your house like every other week
Once my room got so messy I just stopped going into it until i had to sleep
Yes, my room is that messy, ( please help me, because nobody will )
My whole house is a holding room
it scares me that her "hoarding room" looks like my actual room...
That spider moment was funny
When she almost dropped the candle my heart dropped with it is2g
EVA!!! how ya doin?
8:30 why are her hoarding problems so funny 😂😂😂
I am so happy so you Eva!!!
The hoarding room is like the dirty bubble from spongebob

Ohhh never mind I forgot their sisters
How does Eva make cleaning a room so fun to watch?
I thought that I’m the only one that has a hoarding room 🤣
this is the only "clean-up" video that I could watch till the end because EVERY.SINGLE.YOUTUBER just throws shit out without donating or recycling any of them OR they don't even give a disclaimer about how bad consumerism is, so THANK YOU! 💕
7:04 i read "letting go of BTS" and I was like OK, let me read it again
1st comment
lmao that’s by room every week
Eva or you dating Brant
Is it just me, or is this video really satisfying ☺️.
Anonymous person = Brent

Wait.. That’s a hoarding room that looks like my actual room 😂😂😂
0:03 you look unreal
THERE ONCE WAS A DINGUS THAT ATE A WIG! your welcome, eva
Please do a video explaining what happened to it’s all wild
Eva is such a well organized young woman.  She is a perfect role model. :)
Maya is soooooo pretty
and now that your room is cleaned up and stuff u could film a wig video on where you got them, how you take care of them (when swimming in the ocean and stuff..) I would really enjoy a video like that ☺️
Roses are red 
Voiles are blue
Make this blue 
If u love Ava too
Was anyone else worried that there were just tampons on the ground
This like makes me want to do that to my room thank you.
Maya looks just like Eva they look identical when I saw maya I thought it was Eva
Who else thinks Mable should come back
My room always is so messy and all the time i clean it after a few hours it will akways look terrible again. Your Video inspired me to clean up and throw the things away i dont need. Thank you i love your Videos ❤🤞
2:45 I was like what wait IS THAT MY ROOM
I stand with Eva. #beherenow
TAKE IT OUT AND STABB IT IT WORKED FOR ME
I have a hoarding room
Its called my bedroom😄😄
It’s your carbon monoxide detector
Eva my room has gotten way messier then that 😭
My actual room like the one that I’m in right now is messier than your hoarding room and I’m kind of embarrassed about it 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Having a chicken or rooster in your kitchen is supposed to bring good luck
I’m totally Eva when it comes to wanting everything in the store
I bet the person who was anonymous was Brent Rivera
Do more videos like this love seeing the before and after look! Love your water/ ocean pictures all over the house and in rooms!
Omg did y'all see brent's video when Lexi made him call Eva and say I love you😍 yk he meant it😏 #breva😝
My hoarding room... is my own bedroom
when the witness is brent
ur hoarding room literally just looks like my bedroom
lol 15:57 bum cream hahahahaha lol
Your smoke alarm is connected to the electricity but it has a back up battery in case the electricity fails, and it's beeping because the battery is flat and needs replacing.
How does someone let their room get this gross though 🤢😂
I have literally the same journal as Eva
My ocd kicked in during this🤢
I love your videos, they always are fun, have a little craziness and some take conscience messages. Love you gurl.
#shnitzlesquad love you Eva like if you ship breva
You have to talk to the fire department to fix the smoke alarm I’m pretty sure..
Life hack use dry shampoo instead of bug spray 



😂😂
#avasquad
1:13 
I know what it is, my family had this problem, it’s your carbon thing detector ( it detects gasses and stuff in your house it should be in a outlet
Dude! 😱
Did you kiss Brent!?!?
Cleaning makes me so stress free Cause I literally suffer from OCD if something triggers me lol
I think it is safe to say we all have a hoarder's room lol!
Im having an anxiety attack seeing those uggs in may
omg eva i love ur channel !!!!! also, you should do a "caught cheating on my boyfriend prank" on brent!!! You could use caleb and use the "my boyfriend goes through my phone" challenge as a cover!!
0:34 I know thats you brent ;)
I luv it soooo much!! @ the beginning of this yr I cleaned out my cupboard and the playroom, and there was so much stuff that we donated after 😂❤️
This is the amount of stuff she has in that room 👇👍

Fire alarms are connected up to the electricity but they also have batteries in them in case of a fire 🔥when the power is out. Would be a good idea to get someone to have a look. xx
Ava can you show us your real hair
Cmon Eva we all know the blurred person was Brent
You should film videos there
My room had gotton way messer than that so dont be embarrassed
#can relate
wait thats not a hoarding room- that’s my room.
My room is like always messy and once i cleaned it and I got rid of 3 garbage bags worth if thing😕
Yo Eva, I was just watching your videos and I watched” there’s children in my attic and my dog sees them”
And I looked up what”Main Street Spanish fork 2:30pm both brothers.” It turns out that in like 1940 this family lived there and these children used to always go to this theater or something I didn’t read the whole thing. But if you look it up and read it you might find out why there was children in your attic.         
Love you.
It’s not as bad as I expected. I was expecting you to open the door and junk to fall out
вrenт тalĸιng ιn тнaт voιce нaѕ мe weaĸ 😂😂💀
I LOVE THE START OF THIS VIDEO!! HHAHAHAHA
I watched this while I was cleaning my room and now I’m inspired lol
Eva do u have a security alarm? My security alarm makes that noise when it needs more batteries. It will beep and it gets really annoying
Eva! Write another book! Go very raw and tell us the ins and outs to success
Love this video!

OMG, what a transformation. I love your styling so much, you give me so much inspiration for my room and I would like to thank you for that. Also could you please tell me the shop where you went and bought the new decorations for this room? because they are just amazing. I also love how at the start you were wearing an Aussie hat because I'm from Australia :) I love how you are so passionate about our environment as I am too.

I LOVE that big white dresser thing! Where did you get it?
What happened to Eva’s cat, Paris?
Is Brent your bf???
Thank you for sharing this! I hate to admit it but I had a room like this until about a year ago but it got turned into an office 🐙 so worth it! I can't approve of the spider murder tho 😖

Eva’s videos motivate me so much 😂

Love that your house has an oceany vibe 🥰
My room was like that with clothes
I thought the tanning glove was ham
Let's get this girl to 10 mill!!!

MY POTATO LIKES TO GO ON LONG WALKS

that spider was like "what did i do to deserve this..?"
looking at my room in shame
I have a closet in my room that is like this
You have a twin WHAAAAT
Yes I have had a room like that but the mess was half of a foot deep
I had a hoarding chair... 😂😂😂 it literally was like that room but just clothes. My bedroom used to be like that but not as bad.
Who is still not gonna clean their room after this?
At least it got to you that it got bad
Is that indonesia flag you have in your shirt?
Eva........
YOUR HAIR IS BOOOOOMBBBBB 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣GIRLLLLLLLL
G irl that is nothing compared to my room last summer
So many people are doing these style videos and I’m living for itttt
Is it bad if my room is 10 times dirtier than that room....
I love your viedos
This video inspired me to clean under my bed because the mess is so bad that I don't even want to clean it. It's hard when everything only get lost but I never want to whats under my bed because it's so messy😅
it’s so sad that in america people just randomly kill spiders, in 🇿🇦 south africa that doesn’t even cross your mind unless it’s extremely dangerous 🤦‍♀️
That spider is cute and little if u live in Australia
3:28 her laugh tho 😂😂😂
The worst thing about organizing/decluttering is that you can’t just do one room. You end up with piles that belong in other areas of the house and then you realize you need to organize those areas/rooms to fit the stuff that belongs in there.
Is she wearing a wig in this one cuz it looks so cute
Why do you use fake hair
Omg that’s so funny the stuffed fox you had in your hands at the store my baby boy has it!
hey🍏🇷🇺💞
Please please give us a wig collection video!

My room has been  worse
brent 
hhhhhh
My room is my hoarding room it’s not that bad but I have a dried up fruit by the foot in there I never felt like cleaning it up (it’s been in there for half a year)
Anyone else notice that Brent is the Anynomous guy?
Is no one gonna mention how amazing her mom looks?? Like I would've thought that she was Eva's freind aha 😂💗
You should stay there for 24 hours
Eva the question is has your room ever been worse
I can tell that that blured guy was brent     #breva
Who else wants to see Taylor’s and carries face?!
Eva: did you steal our money?
Carrie: y’all hear sumn?
Eva is talking about how Carrie was like a scammer and a liar and stuff and the whole time Alaine is just like “I NeVEr GoT mY MoNEy BAcK” 😂
her friend is so pretty and i love her hair. ♥️
Does anybody else keep forgetting that Taylor and Carrie aren’t there real names 😂 

This is the most likes I’ve every gotten omg thanks 😊👋🏽
next video on youtube : my name is carrie and i was evas friend
Carrie girl u need to get ur act together






"Don't do fake ids kids "👍
This is random..... but


Alaine’s hair is GOAAAAALLLLLSSSSS
Anyone else hear Eva's cat purring in the background?
Everyone else: talking about how Carrie scammed them.
Me: OMG! aLAinE Is sO PrETtY





No but seriously, she is 
The irony is that now Eva can earn so much more than what Carrie stole from her. And she can do that just by telling stories about Carrie.
You
Are
Probably 
Wondering
Who
The
Most
Beautiful 
Person
Is

Hint: First Two Words😌♥️!
I can hardly sympathize. You gave this girl 75 more chances after she stole and lied and proved she couldnt be trusted. That being said it is a quality storytime lol
Alaine looks like a mix between Paris Berelc and Gina Rodriquez
Wow she’s a psycho and a criminal😂😂😂 Glad you guys cut her off completely!
Carrie watching, be like: "I wonder who is she talking about??? lol"
Do a video of you confronting her!!! 🤯🤯😱😱😱😱
you should make a video where we send you our bad friend experiences and you share them and react to them on your channel
Their's something so calming about listening to other peoples stories
hey guys today is my 12th birthday and I don't have any friends at all and I love to watch Eva's vids because shes so positive and awesome, but anyway I would really appriciate it if I got 12 likes.




PS. Your Awesome:)
Part 3: interviewing Carrie to confront her 😂😂😂
Love this so much though ❤️😂
Omg thanks for 2k likes I didn’t expect that! Thanks ❤️
Omg. I worked at Western Union corporate in 2015. I wish I still worked there so I could look up and see if she ever even sent that alleged Western Union money transfer. 🧐
Its kinda funny how their like "just wait till your 21" and then there"s me over here in Australia, only has to wait till i'm 18
who else wants to see Talyor's and Carrie's face
God is a Pen

Eva is a Highlighter

God draws the world

Eva makes it brighter 💖
So uh, will there be a part 3 cuz I’m enjoying this. 

Edit: OMG Tysm I didn’t expect to have so many likes! And sorry if you’re afraid of Kermit the Frog 🐸.
Message from Carrie: "omg Eva how could someone do that to you"
Eva: *insert sinful words"
I got scammed too once 😭😭😭😭
Lesson: if it sounds too good to be true or in any way illegal just don’t fall for it
Also I went on Spotify and I found your New Years playlist on part one hahah haha 😂 😂 I’m dead
EVERYBODY PLEASE READ
JESUS LOVES YOU ❤️
GOD BLESS YOU ✝️
YOU ARE LOVED, BEAUTIFUL, SMART, AND WORTHY ✨
IDENTITY THEFT ISN'T A JOKE JYM! MILLIONS OF FAMILY'S SUFFER EVERY YEAR!
Alaine is gorgeous and she looks so much like Gina Rodriguez. (Jane from Jane the Virgin)
Carrie and Taylor watching this movie like: Damn girl you love to expose me...😂
In Australia where i'm from the drinking age is 18
those 300 dislikes are all separate accounts from carrie and taylor
The fact that Carrie and Taylor posted stories all long, being completely unbothered, really tells how stupid they are, if you’re not already convinced 😂
actually a really funny comment
Me:😂😂😂
Edit: thanks for the likes guys this means a lot to me !! 
Me:😐
Now Carrie would probably be regretting doing that (or not) I honestly wish she confronts her in the next video or something. I don't understand why people do such things.
Carries name is Karin camou, she has a YouTube channel and her instagram username is @cowmou_
Here is the official “MORE STORYTIMES PLEASE”.     ⬇️
You can't even be mad at Carrie by this point because who would trust someone like that with $80😂 and you didn't even check the Instagram before, like no effort went into seeing if it was legit before you gave the money
Eva: "where did you get the money to drink? & where did you get the fake id because your not freaking 21!!! lmfaoooo I'm so DEAD. 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Am I the only one who always imagined “Kerry” rather than “Carrie” and got confused with who Carrie was seeing all the comments 😹
The side profile of your friend looks so much like Kourtney Kardashian! Y’all are gorg.
I love the storytimes!! Like if u want Eva to make more
I loooove you're story times, pleaseeee more!!!!!❤ In my opinion you're chanel should be of story times, conspiracies and photography PLEASEEEEEEEE ❤❤❤
Omg Eva you neeeeeddd to do more story times they r acc the funniest vids everrr😂😂paranormal, tea, crush, breva🥰story times we👏🏼want👏🏼 them👏🏼 all👏🏼xxx
Alaine is so pretty!!! I love her hair❤️
Wow 8 times 86 equals 688 
 
Plus her job money 



Wow
I think you need to text Carrie and say "Hey i would like my $80 back now. Thanks for stealing it in 2015!"
More story times Ava! Love you so much, you are amazing, also #breva forever!
Omg can't believe you guys were silly enough to trust her like that 😂 yous legit sent $700 to her bank account
You and your friend are both literally so gorgeous!!!!!!!!! 😱🙄❤️❤️ it’s so not fair!!! I love you!!!! 💕❤️
Here in Australia we only have to wait to 18 to drink
can we appreciate how she put no ads 😭❤ edit- thanks for all the comments and likes💋
Carrie should be in part 3 omggg
No one:

Literally no one:

Me:you should do a story time about you and Brent !!!
I AM CARRIE. BTW, my name is Gabrielle.








LOL, jk
Also we your subscribers remember pretty much all of the times you were posting, doing things like do it yourselfie an stuff like that  so it's insane to think you were dealing with all that shit while we had no clue. We love you! ❤️
Those dislikes are Carrie's all 300 fake YouTube channels.
You should confront Carrie
I’m just saying one of my friends, let’s call her Emma. Emma was like 19 when this happened and her boyfriend was 21 and her friends were too. We were all gonna go to LA for the week for another friend’s birthday, but I didn’t go because I was sick plus I didn’t like that person much so :/ anyways she got a fake ID for $48.26 and it was due to arrive on Tuesday. The flight was on a Thursday and they were heading to the club Thursday night so she would have her ID when it came to buying drinks. It was Tuesday, she already paid the money and was waiting for the delivery. She emailed the dude on gmail and asked when her ID was coming. He dead ass pretended she was a “ BANNED CUSTOMER “ and cancelled her delivery. Then she couldn’t go to LA so :/ 


I thought it might’ve been the same person!
Alaine 

Thinks of Seven Deadly Sins

Me:BANNNN!!!!
Next video should be confronting Carrie
Like if you want to see
Alaine is so pretty OMG and I love her hair and jacket ♥️♥️ 

Eva is too obviously
Ok just glancing at the thumbnail I thought her friend was Princess 🤦🏽‍♀️
woah, Alaine looks like an airbrushed model, FROM ig
Ugh I just really Eva ❤️❤️❤️❤️
*carrie watches this*  *gets triggered because she knows everything you say is true*  *emails youtube: yOu nEeD tO tAkE tHiS viDeO dOwN riGhT nOw*
Noah fence you're stupid to trust Carrie over and over again.
Why does Elaine remind me of Kourtney Kardashian xD
Wow I love ur storytimes love u eva plz expose her lmaooo <3
I have been loving these story times! You should definitely do more!
Next video: "Confronting Carrie." Go Shane Dawson on this girl.
I am so happy someone connects with me I thought I was the only crazy person in this world who had a friend like that. Like u just became my favorite you tuber.
Wow this is insane , you have been through so much shit and you are still a strong independant woman ,
LOVE YOU EVAAAAAA
Who else is scanning the comments for Carries secret account commenting
Your friend on the left looks a little like Kourtney Kardashian, Amerie & Jhene Aiko.
SHE PROTECT
SHE ATTACK
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY 
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY BACC 

*Edit cause y’all kept correcting me*.
AND THANKS FOR  ALL THE LIKES
nobody understand HOW MUCH I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR . THIS
OMG YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ARE SOOO PRETTY!! LIKE HOW?! ❤❤❤

I love the fact that Alaine is just not getting over the fact that she is never going to get her money back. That is so me. This is why I love her and Eva so much 😂❤️

Edit: omg thank you all for 1k likes I’ve never had so many 😱❤️
Lol she literally used WESTERN UNION to collect people’s money. 

W E S T E R N    U N I O N

Guys come on now 😂

*and per the dude’s request!!! You automatically know it’s a scam if Western Union is even mentioned omg
Is it true you were on Disney's bizaardvark?! You were so amazing!!😄
The email was sent on my birthday March 23

CARRIE GIVE THAT GIRL HER DAMN MONEYYYYYYYU BACKKKKKKKK JESUS!!! 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
At least you clapped back and made probably 100's more from this video
The moral of the story is to stalk ppl on Instagram before committing to something
In your channel discription theres a 9,000,000 Subs checkpoint so when do you update that date ?
6:10 did anyone else hear a weird sound? It was like a low pitched kinda satisfying scratching sound?
LOVEEEE THE MATCHING CASES 💓💓💓
Discovered your storytimes yesterday
I have now watched like 15
Imagine if this compulsive liar is watching Eva's vid!!!! lol
Eva’s cat: *exists*
Me: asmr GOD
Alaine: (16:13) Im'ma cry, I'm never getting my money back.
Me: *Dies with laughter*😂😂😂

the silver lining to this is that the views from these videos probably make you more than she stole. i wonder if she realizes that lmao x"D
those 109 dislikes are Carrie and Taylor making fake accounts...

The “Literal Psychopath” in my life is my Aunt
This makes my heart hurt, I got scammed out of £400 for a phone at age 15, which was my Christmas and birthday savings. 
Y’all were college students who lost $87. But at least we won’t make the same mistakes again :/
You should make a video where you switch phones with Brent Rivera for a week.
I keep forgetting Carrie isn’t her real name 😂😂 — love these storytimes 💛
I know this is so off topic but Eva is born 7/29 when I am born 7/30, but she is older than me! 

Oh an Carrie fudge yourself because what you did is fricking wrong. 😒
Yes I was waiting for Part 2! ❤️
DO MORE STORIESSS
Just so y’all know, carrie is the fake name that Eva uses for privacy reasons:)
She's probly like who's  carrie🤔

Damn Carrie is an a hole
Fudge her man
Tbh I can relate to part 1 a LOT
So... Part 3?

Also did y’all notice that anyone in the comments could be Carrie..?
She's a mastermind.
Eva: What is up, my Schnitzels!
Subtitles for me: what is up, my bicycles!
Subtitles for others: what is up, my straight so!!!!


Edit: sorry the part where it said “bicycles” might have been a second AFTER what all you guys had on subtitles

More story times please! Your life is so interesting!
You and Elaine look so alike!!
Honestly? I'd love to know who they are.
I definitely wouldn't be as patient as you were.  I can't stop picturing them in the future and what they might end up being capable of.

OMG STUPID CARRIE
My bad friend story is super recent lmao

So it started the beginning of this year, Im a freshman in highschool, and I'm looking for a friend cuz I deadass had none. My one friend had moved schools (we still hang out now, but that's besides the point), so I was alone. In dance class we had our first partner or group project, so I chose to be with this girl Gabby and Annyka, bc they didn't look uptight. 

Fast forward some weeks, I'm friends with this girl Annyka. We're rlly close, but she's kinda off to me n idk y. (Aka my natural instincts telling me stay away from her smh) so I ignore it like a dumb bitch.

The first red flag goes up, I see everyone lowkey tries to avoid her. And she opens up to me abt being 'bullied' all her life. I confident in that bc I was too, rlly severally to the point I was depressed in 5th grade thru now (I'm much better now tho). 

Second red flag goes up, she stands rlly close to me despite me telling her to back up, bc I like personal space. also, in more deep talks she's very vague and not as open as she once was. This leads me to ask more questions often, leading to me apologize later bc I don't like bothering ppl for my own curiosity. She says it's fine

(This is happening over a span of a CPL weeks btw) Third red flag, some guy from her old school is interested in me bc he thinks I'm cute (and me having no experience dating was like oh wow!) She tells me n I'm like yeah he kinda fine too ngl, she gets mad at me bc apparently he's not 'a nice guy'. (Later to find out I was the side hoe, but even then, he apologized and he's a fairly nice guy when ur not dating him) 
I start dating the guy, bc he confessed n I was like o shit u cute, then Annyka wants more time bc I'm not giving her enough time. I try n sort it out evenly but she doesn't agree it's even. She wasn't open to the idea if hanging out with both me n my then boyfriend so I'm left being dragged off by her every two seconds when with him, or cock blocked.

Fourth red flag, she convinces me that I'm not worth anything to said boyfriend, that I was gonna b used for sex n that's it, so I end up breaking up with him. I'm a little sad for awhile but Annyka tells me she was here for me. 

I start making more connections as the days progress, and more n more Annyka gets more intolerant with me. She starts saying things that are negative towards me n it seeps to the back of mind, it tears down my confidence. She says my fashion style is ugly (but hers it literally just a broke version of Emma Chamberlain it's not even 'creative'), that my hair wouldn't look good short on me. She vents to me daily n never asked how I was doing, so I bottled up things going on in my life for her, and it took a toll on me. my best friend who moved schools was always checking up on me bc she knew I was once suicidal and still was depressed, so she started making sure I was ok. My good friend now, Skylar also did the same. Ppl could tell I was mentally drained and not physically okay. but I insisted I was fine bc I didn't want to annoy them.

Skip to November, I'm over my ex, a new guy steps in n we have mutual feelings. My friend Annyka again gets mad. It's like a repeat of the last time. Except worse. We were in n out if friendship. The guy I was with was really nice (despite being homophobic which led to me breaking up with him bc we fought so much abt the subject), I tell her exactly this when confronting her "is it me? what if it was a girl i was with, what would you say then?" (I'm bi) and she replies with idk but your boyfriend just wants you for sex. 

Another flag, It was near december and I told her I wasn't going to be friends until she specified what exactly and when I was doing something wrong. I go soft when she gives me another yet vague answer. Skip to lunch one day, I wanted to spend lunch with my then bf and she said straight up it's not fair. This is when my friend Arianna steps in and calls Annyka out for me, saying it's literally one period I'll see her later. Annyka breaks down crying bc she can't get her way.

Skip forward to almost winter break I was friends again with Annyka but I have grown resentment. I still have a problem with hanging out with both my bf n her. Alot of ppl start telling me she's toxic (including my mom). so one day I go to vent to her abt my dad (who's verbally abusive) and she completely changes the subject to her halfway through. It's not even on topic it was about food. She interrupted something I needed to get out and ask advice on for food she had gotten last week. I literally break down after lunch bc I feel stuck, my now also good friend Stella n Leyla offer to hear me out but I tell them I again don't want them involved in such dumb drama. My friend Skylar also notices it.

The next day I run into Annyka after trying to avoid her and she started talking to me, saying my bf was this n that. I'm so drained that I just laugh it off. During lunch I have an anxiety attack and ask my mom to take me home bc I couldn't handle being there. Annyka had told everyone what a' fake and toxic' person I am. Despite still being friends with me.

That day I posted something saying goodbye to everyone bc I was tired n felt like a bother to everyone. I tried to kill myself that night as my mom slept.
But I backed out when I saw my internet friends and best friend were texting me, I even had my best friend on video chat until I fell asleep.(she's literally the best, idk how to repay her except do the same when she needs help)

The next day Annyka apologized and said she was sorry for being a bitch basically.

Skip forward January, the same shit is happening and Im having a really off day.  I snapped at Annyka and basically gave her a reality check saying that she was either a physcho or gay for me and I told her I didn't want to b friends.

Skip forward she started talking to me 2 months ago, saying she's changed. We talk, but when I break up with my bf she asks me to record it for her, high fives me, rewards me like a dog, etc. I told her, I'm not ur fucking pet, stop talking to me, don't ever talk to me again, I'm seriously done with your bullshit.

Rn I have a Loving circle around me n I'm as mentally healthy as I can b. She still doesn't talk to me thankfully but she gives me dirty looks etc. I can hear comments about me from her half of the time but I always remind myself, your the bigger person by not responding.
(When I was depressed in 6th grade I became violent towards others, I hung out with bad kids, thru 7th grade I hung with them until I realized I needed to change. They bullied me into silence and istg I almost became mute. thankfully I moved schools in 8th grade bc if divorce n met my good friend. Point of this lil antidote, I'm trying not to revolt back to my old self. I only want to improve and grow with others. I could've faught her. Done the things she's done to me, but in the end does it benefit her?? Does it benefit me?? No.)

Sorry this is so long lol
Girl,

Bro I have a friend like that RN lmao
Yay!!! Love ur vids and ur such a good story teller 😁
Eva becoming a story time channel? I’m not only here for it but I’m GAGGING about it PLEASE do more
I had a best friend 
Here it goes 

So in May 2017 my new boyfriend and I (we’re still together) went to a party and met a girl called Amber. 
She was dating a guy named Mike at the time. 
Mike and I are still friends. Him, his current girlfriend, Jessica, my boyfriend and I all hangout from time to time. 

So back when Mike and Amber we’re together Amber was my best friend I loved her to death. We lived two hours away from each other but spend hours on the phone together. I mean literal hours at a time. We told each other EVERYTHING!!!
She tells me she has a miscarriage and how much she misses that baby and etc. (this will come up later) I STG. I loved this girl.

So time goes on and I go pick her up from her house TWO hours away. I borrowed my cousins car, (which she threw in my face) I paid for gas, and my boyfriend drove to go get her.

She stayed at my house one night while my parents were out (sorry mom) and all was cool. 

She was supposed to stay all weekend, but got mad at me because I went to bed with my boyfriend at like 4 am so she got picked up by a guy called John and a mutual friend of ours Derek in the morning.

So I went about my business.

She started staying at Johns house (only like 30 mins away from mine) and then broke up with mike.

I later found out John was her ex boyfriend.

So I support her decision and am her best friend and kinda but mike on that back burner for her. Wrong move but we were so close, our birthdays were a day apart. We even celebrated and had a huge rave lined for us it was the best thing.

It was my boyfriend who talked to the producer so it was really for me, she tried acting like she was queen until she got sloppy drunk and puked in the parking lot.

Anyway as time goes on she stops taking to me less and less. Okay, but then like the only time she hits me up is to tell me she’s still in love with mike but John just bought her a car. 

And that she’s going and trying to sleep with mike while he’s dating Jessica. And the whole situation was just messed up and I was caught in the middle of her lie. But I just kinda let her do her. 

So day almost a year later near the end of May she hits me up to tell me we’re going to kick it. Cool. Except she bailed on me to go do drugs with her friends. 
Then a week later tells me she’s pregnant. 
We had a music festival to attend in a week  and being pregnant at one isn’t a problem, just don’t do drugs. 

She said it’s because she had already done drugs and she didn’t want the baby to be messed up but she went ahead and got an abortion. I didn’t necessarily agree with that choice but it’s not my choice to make.

I would have been more okay with it in the end if she weren’t  doing more drugs a week later,  I FEEL that it was done so she could cover her cheating or keeping doing more drugs either way idk.

So I let her once again make her own choices. I told her though that I’ll still love you and you’ll still be my girl but I don’t want to be babying your emotions for a choice you’re making. 

I don’t have to give you sympathy for getting an abortion. That’s your choice. So then own up to it. 

So she gets mad that I set that boundary. I don’t think someone would be so willing to just up and abort after a devastating miscarriage but I guess that’s just me.

So it rolls around to be festival time, and a friend of mine flew from Cali to Illinois for this. mike was supposed to pick him up, and take him, but mike had an expired sticker so we took my friend and mike.

We all shared a larger friend ground that I met the same night as Amber 

So my whole group camped together

Except amber camped with John and his friends. 

I tried to visit her, they asked me to leave their camp site in the pouring rain. So we did, i tried hitting her up for sets she never answered. She only came to my campsite once when mike was gone. 

But I ending up hanging with mike most of the weekend which was fine to me. 

I was taking all kinds of pictures with ALL OF MY FRIENDS mine was just in ALOT Of them.

So I post this big mushy post on Facebook post about “missing waking up with my best friend laughing and carrying on” after the weekend is over and we go home and I posted all of the pictures I took with all my friends. 

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HERES WHERE IT GETS SPICY

She had previously DELETED HER WHOLE ACCOUNT

gone with the wind. 

SHE SENT ME SCREENSHOTS
OF MY FACEBOOK POST

WDYMmMMMMMM 

OMG 

And is like mad that I hung out with mike and not her... and I’m like throughly confused like aren’t you banging him anyway what is the problem? I don’t understand. Like just because you’re banging two dudes doesn’t mean I am. 

And she like just went off about how I deserved everything that happened in my childhood and that I was a horrible person, and that my boyfriend was gonna leave me and never have kids with me and all kinds of just shit.

Like I can’t kick him out of my camp site I’d have to convince 15 of his other friends to kick him out for someone who isn’t even camping there is a nonissue in my Brian idk. And she failed to ever message back so I don’t think I was in the wrong there idk. 

Not going to lie I was a little petty at the end. I told her to apologize she said no,
I screen-shot every text where she told me she was cheating on mike, and sent it to him. 
I don’t ever know what happened in that situation. I dismissed myself.

Everyone says I went to far, I honestly just told the truth.

Maybe I’m petty, maybe I’m that crazy person in her life. 
But I can sleep good knowing that even if I am that crazy person at least I told the truth to John in the end 🤷🏼‍♀️

Carrie just seems like that one person who's a psychoooooo

Is there gonna be a part 3?
Those 233 dislikes is Carrie making multiple accounts
96 for fake id’s lmao a “deal”
I love your Story Time videos.
you should do more videos like this
When she started explaining the discount I thought "that sounds like a piramide scam"
Carrie was probably the one making the id's
her hair is flawless
i really want to c carrie right now how can a person be like that
The end of the video...
Eva:WE GOT SCAMMED!! (Like she just found out)

Okay can I ask for some advice? So I rly liked this guy for a while and we were rly good friends for a long time, but I had never really told anyone except my best friend that I liked him. But like a month later my best friend told me that she rly liked him and later that week they became kinda bf and gf. But then like months later they started having problems and the guy I liked started to show signs that he liked me back. However my best friend still thinks that they are dating but the guy told me he didn’t rly like her anymore. I rly rly like this guy but I know if I were to tell him it would rly hurt my best friend. What should I do???
love how your friend was just hung up on the $86 the whole time. MOOD
Another story please ly eva

I don't know why you would let someone that cruel into your life. You deserve so much more than her Eva. I hope you see this, and to anyone else who does, have a nice day.
People in the comments figured out who “Carrie” is. And now that comment thread is gone. Coincidence?? ☕️🐸
Change your fire detector batteries!

MORE STORY TIMES ❤️❤️❤️

Am I the only one who read the email?😂
Plot twist : the "Carrie" and "Taylor" was actually they're real names :v
Evas parents "told her"...she didnt listen...and got scammed
Eva "told" her friends...they didnt listen....AND GOT SCAMMED
i think theres a lesson here...
The scary part about this is the fact that this person asked for your signatures. They could probably use them to sign off on documents, payments, etc under your name lmao.
I am kinda going through the same thing right now🙄
I love watching these videos 🧡🧡🧡
I hope this Kerry person is watching maybe she will learn a life lesson


DONT LIE
Y'all should've called the police on her!
“Carrie” and “Taylor” probably made a whole bunch of fake YouTube accounts and disliked this 😂

I was best friends with someone for 8 years who was stealing from my dad's bank account. People use us because we can be too naive & trusting 😬
Who is Carrie like real name
I never got scam but I had a lie person that done the same thing which I don't talk to that person no more.
You don't have to be 21 to drink in Hawaii... Lmao just saying!!
This girl is crazy
Please give us more storytimes. I miss the story time phase of YouTube. Anybody else feel me?
I have her name is Brooklyn
How unfortunate is it that my name is Carrie 😂
But like I feel these two on such a spiritual level right now! I let someone back in whom I know did me wrong and yet it bit me in the Ahh as well 😂😂😭 good riddance though
Hi we have the same name lmao
And now look your a famous and rich YouTuber and she’s a nobody 🙃😂
Eva.... ur like a detective! I don’t think I could actually do a puzzle like that. Tbh.... Carrie (or whoever that is) is just such a... bish. >:|
okay does anyone else hear a growling noice from the camera and an alarm going off in the back every now and then
Please part 3

“I promise you that i am very responsible with money”

#BREVA
Moral of the story: listen to your parents
Use me as a “I hate Carrie” button
What top are you wearing? It's so pretty! Especially with your skin tone!
I just realized I'm friends with a compulsive liar. 
Umm..
I hate Carrie and Taylor 

But love ur guy friend
thank you so so much for helping GREAT BARRIER REEF here in Australia 💙
Yall..if these two were my friends...I would’ve been in jail for murder.
GIRL you too nice lmao that coffee table wouldve shattered and party wouldve been OVER, hell no
takes snapchat video laying in Evas bed
Eva: didn't I tell u not to go into my room and in the loft? 
the girl: oh that was my bed.. and the cat was my cat.. that look just like urs... my room is just like urs I guess :/
“Cuz your period doesn’t come out of your freaking ear” BAHHAHA
I’m still upset that Taylor didn’t pay for the glass table
Wow Im about to watch the Part 2








IM SO SO HAPPY.





AND I SHIP YOU AND BRENT YOU GUYS ARE A GOOD COUPLE.
This is why I dont want friends 


Definitely not cause I'm unsociable  and lonely
Carrie is such an awful liar. At least settle on one story CARRIE WTF
Also does Carrie see these vids?
Me editing after part 2: CARRIE F***IN DOES SEE THESE VIDS WTF
Also I’ve watched this like 6 times...
EVAA WHY WOULD YOU LET CARRIE HOUSESIT. 😦!!!!
Omg she’s a psycho! I’m surprised you let her house sit and take care of your 🐱...! I would have just cut her out completely after that new year party! What a horrible friend you have😱😱😱
who else is back for a refresher before part 2?
HOLY FLIIIIP im glad im naturally blunt and anytime something comes up thats not right i will say thing very directly and intimidate people off which sounds good to me rn
Girl! This would NEVER happen to me. I learned how to say NO at 2! Also House-sit?!?! Girl if you dont put that cat in a pet daycare. This was probably a blessing for you to help your naivety
low key Carrie and Taylor probably have planned for something like this for years
I think you should fight with her like at the moment she started planning party.

Not to mention destroying everything and you let her into her house when u were gone?!?!?
You’re such a good storyteller, Eva. Sorry you went through that. You came out on top and your vibes and soul beautiful💖
is anyone else obsessed with her top? i’m living for that spring/summer vibe😍
Eva : your period doesn’t come out of your freaking ears 😂😂😂
Me : THE TEA HAS BEEN SPILT ☕️
I haven’t skipped a second through out this whole video and I am beyond irritated  WTF CARRIE?!?!
girl, you’re dumb for never saying anything to them when it happened. Waiting until the very end to say something only enabled her behavior smh
This happened to me...IN SECOND GRADE!!
Feel sorry for ya
"parents are always right," -MyLifeAsEva
American culture is so weird... Young folk have such...messy priorities. Glad I wasn't raised there.
SHE SHARED YOUR ADDRESS?! I WOULD KICK HER A**!
A wanted to scream at that "carrie" girl when I heard this for you literally i was so mad for you 🤬
go get you a bunch of REAL friends like eva’s 🤪💗
Oh and the music definitely makes it worse
(I mean like it sounds scary no hate)
Welcome to "Eva's Bad Life Choices"
This gives me anxiety...
I’ve gotten so good at cutting off toxic friends that I only have like 3 friends left
Lol
You don’t now how many times I had to refill my teacup
I haven’t watched her in ages.
She’s doing great 💗💗
Congrats for helping save the reef I love that!!!!!
I come back to her channel after a year... 
IM SO PROUD OF WHAT THIS CHANNEL HAS BECOME
Honestly i feel like we have all had that one friend, a compulsive liar... relatable. 😑 Honestly feels so much better once you just cut ties w them and drop em!!!
OMG I feel so good I am not the only one. The same thing (almost) happened to me. Thanks for sharing!!
This is my first time seeing one of your videos, your intro looks exactly like the one James Charles has except with you instead of him. Is it?
Honestly I was sat on my bed watching this with my best friend, and literally the next week she decided to manipulate me just like Carrie did u!!
6:40 lol like if you spotted the mistake
Btw this is not fake, there is an actual mistake.
i don’t know how you did not throw hands with these girls oh my gosh, you are such an angel.
I literally have one just like that though she’s not as bad as Carry 🤨
YOU LET CARRIE HOUSE SIT WTF AVA NO😩
Here's "tap tap" the mother freaking "tap tap" tea
" put your seatbelt on " 
I'm in the car and I forgot to put my seatbelt on..........OOPS😯
Turns out my Best Friend used me just to become popular, and when she was more popular than me, she left me.
I was BFF with a liar for almost 8 years, i'm happy to have a better BFF now! 😊
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT IM IN LOVE PLEASE RESPOND
u have been through so much.
i pray that this doesn't happen again to you.
every thumbs up on this comment is how many ppl think Ava is such a nice person

edit: OMG THANKS FOR ALL THE LIKES AVA WILL LOVE US FOR THIS
i got an ad about narcissistic help before the video
Man Ava your so mf nice idk how you didn’t burst in the beginning I just tell people the truth straight up 😂😂💀‼️ 😭
THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IN IS AUSTRALIA .... I live in Australia 🇦🇺!! Yay
Plz plz plz. I beg of u to make a part 2. That was getting sooo good 😭y would u leave me on a cliffhanger 😭😂luv u
I got used because my best fake friend used me for my friends and my chips
Get friends like that guy who let you sleep. That's a real homie
“when parents say they don’t like one of your friends, their usually right” 🙌🏼🙌🏼 AMEN SISTER! Sending love from Houston🤘🏼♥️💙
Imagine if the people that were in the story watch this omg lol
nah what's bothering me is that after there was poop in your bed and like mad other people in it too, she aint wash the sheets ... LMAOAOAOA
use this as a I love “my life as Eva” button 💗
This title should have been " Ex-Friend from Hell". How could u have kept ur sh** together in her presence, is beyond me?
last time i watched one of ur videos was when u where doing ur high school video lol
skin?clear
tea?spilled
wig?snatched
hotel?trivago
Now like i'm watching this again i'm like "those poor cat ears..."😭
And now i understand that my loneliness is actually just god saying "i got you"

Edit: Omg thanks for all the likes😭❤️
You’re neighbors
.
.
.
she low key sounds like she needs to be in inpatient treatment bc she’s gotten way too good at manipulating ppl around her to just do whatever she wants🤦‍♀️
Those 1.8k likes are carries friends from the many partys. Edit: 1.9k
I’ve just come back to you after years, you used to be my favourite youtuber, but don’t worry, I’m subscribed again 😂
I consider myself nice, but hunty i would've dropped her 😂
Lilsimsie fans, it’s Carrie😂
I know this is off topic but...



WHY DO YOUR EYEBROWS LOOK SO GOOD!!!
i had those cat ears too for the taylor swift concert lol😂😂
Eva:put your seatbelt on 🚘

Me: runs to the bed 🛌 

Me:says tell me the tea ☕️
That's an amazing cause you are supporting, thank you!! We need more people like you
I live in Australia and it’s so great that you an American Care so much about our beautiful and thank you XXX
Omg I live in the whitsundays it’s literally the great Barria reef I am soo thank ful u did this for out beautiful reef in Australia

There is always a experience with fake friends and it nearly always turns out that parents right...
Btw Eva is looking so pretty .... your skin tone is just perfect
I have been saying snitzel squad through out my school ( screaming it ) for two weeks now love you Eva

Eva will you please adopt me? You would be like the perfect mom 😂 I'd be the perf daughter 2! 😂 😂
Sooooo no one's gonna talk about how good Eva's sense of style is? Ok.
{16:54} I am glad that you have friends whose got your back. :-)
Did you purposely name her Carrie?? 🤔
WHERE IS THIS BEAUTIFUL TOP FROM
I'd start hitting her and swearing at her so muccchhh😒🤦‍♀️😂
As soon as you said “I needed a house sitter” I was like oooohhhhh nooooo
I found her "new years Jams" Playlist on Spotify 😂
yo Eva you should make a story time channel
Noooooo not round 2 u can’t let her enter your life again x🤣
this is my first video of yours and I can already tell that your ex friends are complete and utter sociopaths and this is coming from a 13 yo.
I WANT MORE STORYTIMES!! ur such a good storyteller Eva, hope you are okay! ❤️ ur natural hair is amazing 😉
This was great! Well not the stress and drama but the video was 👌

Pt.2!!!!!!! Plz make it this story was VERY VERY good soooo plz make a part 2!!!! Uggghh please!!!
Lol
How do you and James Charles make those intros OMG I want to know
Your bubbly personality is very contagious 💛 This was such an interesting storytime
Eva: My whole makeup bag is gone.
Me: Oh nonononononononono
Her story made me soooooooo mad i am frustrated like eww the poop on her bed
The 2.2k dislikes are probably Taylor and Carrie making multiple accounts with their friends 😂
YOU KNOW WHAT........ maybe


This is 6:42 
Btw
Thank you soooo much Eva for helping the Great Barrier Reef!
god, she’s gorgeous. been a subscriber since the fourth grade, and i’m now a sophomore in highschool. time flies😫

"Kinda Like Criss Cross Apple Sauce"

This made me mad and I didn’t even know the traitor 🤦🏼‍♀️
Eva=put your seat belts on

0:09 #breva
This video was so interesting I actually watched the whole thing haha. Can’t wait for part 2 ❤️

It would be crazy if Carrie or Taylor texted her after the video
And that’s the motherFRICKIN TEA SIS
Eva love ur story times because ur life is so interesting compared to mine please do more!!!💝💝💝
I would’ve killed Carrie🖤
Thank you we need to preserve the great barrier reef!!
I’ve had that friend. She moved. Every time I would try to break it off she would manipulate her way back into my life. She moved, and I couldn’t be more glad about it.
you lok beautiful and you and brent make a good pair you should do a story booth vid and a story booth channel
I um am in this situation atm I currently jus left my 4 bestfriends who were like family to me and well they kinda protected me from all the reality of the world and this was when I now entered high school......
It's been 2 years now and well they left me told me that I was a fake friend and well I have been going through some things at home but eventually I realized that they were actually bringing me down from my work and now I feel great I made some new friends I can actually trust and help me instead of bringing me down
SO as usual I guess u should listen to your parents.... seriously listen to your parents!😂
Omg I love you so much 🥰❤️
One word to describe this story
just got out of a friendship like this LOL 🤣
Plot twist: carries a lesbian & she’s had a crush on you this whole time that’s why she was always wanting to be around 
Plot twist #2: carries was a crazy jealous psychotic person that wanted to be you
I would've fricken shaved off their hair or something,for stealing my makeup,breaking my coffee table and all that shiz
I did not skip this at all fr
Wait what? If the period stain was from New Years then how can it be fresh???
Carrie sounds like a Scorpio
This was an interesting story but I couldn’t stop looking at your arm muscles omg.
6:43 me in EVERY SINGLE scenario
Where is this top/dress from 😍
O my gosh ur so good at saying stories 💘💘💘
Please tell me you didn’t let Keri watch your house...


Oof. Eva 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why does she have to make us wait like this who else hates premiers!
I legit watched the whole video.
Only half way thru the video but I'm so heated just hearing it omg
Not to be off topic but I ❤️ your top were did you get it!
Eva: Hold the drama
Me: and you put a picture of jojo Siwa? what if she see's that
Storytimes with Eva is something that I look forward for more in 2019!
Thick as smh🤦🏻‍♂️
I NEED THAT TOP!!!!! where can I buy it
Friend: Hey Eva, I have to confess something...
Eva: Yes?
Friend: About 6 years ago, I lied to you..
Eva: I was best friends with a compulsive liar for six years...


Nahhh jkk I love Eva 💖
Omg I LOVE that you did that thing for the coral in the Great Barrier Reef! I'm from Australia, so it means heaps to me that people care. (Unlike some senators)
Toxic people 🤮🤮🤮
You saved my life when you said put on your seatbelt.
What happened to Teala by the way?😨
Sksks I felt this but anyways I cut her off my life
Does anyone else think her and LaurDiy should be friends 😯




No just me okay 😂
Bruh
I CAN RELATE TO YOUR STORY
Your story kinda reminds me of my friend in my 4th year of high school
I found you through your "How to survive high school videos" bc I've been homeschooled for my whole life until this year, which is my freshman year in high school. you've helped. e through so much. love you girl!! keep up the good work
Eva legit has the best heart . I can’t actually be friends with Carrie lmfao wtf

Eva has to be a Libra, avoiding confrontation 😭 (I am one that's why I think she is)
I think I was more pissed off at the fact that you kept trusting her Eva ahahah I was screaming, NOOOOO @ my screen 😂
Hi I have my sats rn and me whaching ur vids make me really happy thank youuuu
Hey Eva....I'm not being someone that evil...but if I was you I'm 100% going to blow up and shout to that person like a crazy human that ever existed😂

Can v pls have a laur DIY +eva collab
well me physio friend locked me in a room just because I did the bed wrong
It’s so weird that you post this because last night I found out my bestfriend was a pathothogical liar
But it hurts like hell when you put so much effort
Girl i was friends with a toxic person for 13 years so I got you beat
Bro I would have been so pissed! Well done Eva for keeping ur composure
Omg high five 
I am alone 
Well now I have bff she is my bff from 5th grade but now I am in college still friends with her 😊
Honestly Eva, I cant believe I’m saying this... but I love your top. Actually everything you wear.
I feel like she's more of a pathological liar. She always wants her way kind of idk
told me a whole life lesson 😂😂 its good to know that you cut ties with both toxic people
When she said 
Eva: so put ur seat belt on
Me: I literally had me seat belt on 😁😁😂😂
PART TWO!!!!!! Like if you want part two!!
thank you for helping Australia
Even though I wish there was no part 2, cause you have been through A LOT!!! I still want to see it 😛

lol when she says that guy is already taken xD aren't they always
this KILLED ME i wanted to scream so bad hearing this. i felt like it happened to me lol
Yolo, so in barbie a fairy secret barbie's two designers are called Carrie and Taylor
Carrie you freaking psycho😂
Eva!!! U just proved that ur the sweetest and the most gullible person ever😂😂...Emphasis on the SWEETEST ok.....Love u
I used to not really like you (not as like personality but your content) but now I really enjoy watching you
This video makes me so mad that I literally want to click off 👉🏻🚪 that girl needs Karma
Omg wtf that‘s so messed up...and btw ur nose is really pretty eva😂❤️
1:26 I already have my seat belt on...I’m legit in a car😂
my mom didn't like that gurl she thought she was controlling and just...*current words*
I’m am sure 2 of the dislikes are from Taylor and carrie
This is a juicy story 28:07 like who does that BUY her a new bed if your ruin something why not just pay for it
Please do more story times 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
WHO IS CARRIE?! LOL
This legit made me so freaking mad. No joke. I actually sat and watched through I which never do
My bestfriend was a compulsive liar too i finally cut her off after all these years
i was doing my homework while watching this and i was supposed to write ‘name of discoverer’ instead i wrote ‘name of liar’ ah love this😭😂
This is sooooo relatable and frustrating! Because you can’t do anything about it! 😭🤬😂
YOU KNOW WHAT..........mybe😂! That sentence just got me sooo
how does period blood just end up on a pillow 🤣
Bro this was so hard to watch bc I’m just screaming “JUST SAY NO! “ but then I remember myself at 18/19 and how hard it was to stand my ground. How hard it was to be assertive and risk being seen as “impolite” or “unladylike”. 💖💖 Here’s to the growth in our lives as women. Being braver, stronger, and steadier in this life.
watching this hurt so much🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ girl...
i literally love eva 🤣 “THIS GURL”
hey i'm from ORANGE COUNTY
You're so quirky and cute 😆
Poor Eva....hope that doesn’t happen to you again
When the heel was thrown Carrie would have already been cancelled🤷🏽‍♀️
20:10
January 2 is my birthday :D
This “Carrie” girl sounds like the girl Peach from the Netflix series “You”.
The period stain story happened to me too with my former roommate in college. Immediately moved out the day after!
You look cute in a ponytail!💇‍♀️
Eva should have put cameras they r worth the money 
❤️❤️luv u Eva
Everything happens for a reason
“Everything was crazy and like noodles” 😂 yaaassss Eva
It's literally their fault but u legit made it worse eva- BY TRUSTING THEM LIKE SEVERAL TIMEZZZ
I haven't skipped any of this video. i feel so bad for you Eva but your life is so much more better it and i hope this never happens to you again. p.s i love your videos
Girl out of all things why would u let her watch ur house after everything that happened 😭
fake friends are a piece of crap 🤔🤦‍♀️
"... Carry entered AGAIN" OH. MY. R U KIDDING?!
don't hang out with Carrie she is just going to continue to lie  to you
You look so much like Gina Rodriguez!!!
I'm friends with a compulsive liar and idk how to get away from her  :/
I would've just started throwing hands.
Eva: I put my makeup bag underneath the sink
Me: you wouldn’t mention this if it wasn’t significant, Taylor stole the makeup

Edit: OH JEEZ THAT ALOT OF LIKES, Thank you soooo much, I honestly didn’t think I would get any likes, I was just voicing my thoughts 😊😊thank you
Girllll! I can totally relate. The guy completely used me for my talent for years.
6:40 you are neighbors won’t care? Your sry Eva had to 😂
Jeez! Just listening to the story makes me soooo mad, how did u deal with it?!!?
While watching this my “friend” is being rude and trying to be smart! Lol
(Texting me btw)
How to roast a h8ter 


Roses are red

Violets are blue 

A face like yours belongs in a zoo 

Don’t worry I’ll be there to 

Not in a cage but laughing at you



Guys thank you sooo much I never got this much likes! 😃😃
This video makes me so angry
This had me triggered
I am feeling really mad
Okay you're adorable <3
Eva is so beautiful! Omg her natural hair is stunninggg
Omg literally I was hooked to this story! Some people tho...oof
You should do a collaboration with LaurDIY xx
This is my first time coming across ur channel, and honestly You are sooo BLODDY CUTEEEE😩
I am confused on why she let Carrie house-watch after all the things she did lol....
😂😂 Not everyone is crazy, nope, but we all have the potential to annoy our best friends. 😉
"my life is turns into drama and noodles"
Thank you for making this video ❤️
This is why I don’t have friends by choice, you can hardly trust anybody. 

Also you’re way too nice I would’ve exploded lol!
eva’s responses to everything “carrie” did got me SOOO MAD SKSKSK
I know you have makeup on but man your skin is gorgeouss and flawless. Im jealous 😭😍😍 just found your channel btw. Great story! You got a new sub! And honestly u should of known better than to let carrie house sit your house. lol
This story is basically Eva making life mistakes. I feel bad for you.
Anyone else really annoyed about how nice Eva was to Taylor and Kerrie? HAHAHA Eva is too nice for her own good.
Totally. I had best friends and they  talked behind my back. They talked bad about me to others and one of em like super fake. She's the reason I lost my job.
Makeup is so expensive! The ones that bought you makeup with their own MONEY are your true friends girl DO NOT LOSE THEM!
the period part tho
$1000 really......
Aren’t you like a millionaire
I love how I was literally getting so angry during this video cause of what happened to her😂😂I’m so sorry you had to go through that Eva!!
I promise I will be secretive, mysterious, quiet, and be choosy.
How can someone  be as pretty as she is inside like outside 🤷🏻‍♀️💕😂
Am I the only one picturing people that have been in my life while you explained these traits?!?
I've NEVER seen your hair like dat before
This got me mad kinda cause your ex best friend lied to you and I hate when people lie to you.
Thanks for helping the Great Barrier Reef, Australia appreciates it
Gurl if that happens to me It will be a different story
Eva your not alone I was in a similar situation but mine was for 7-8 years 😿 but I am happy that I got over it ❤️

I think everyone can relate to this Eva It's pretty constant but thanks for the great advice
IS IT CARRIE DAYTON
i hope “kerri” sees this video like bishhhh

Why the hell were you so passive tho omg you let them do this to you over and over
Me texting Carrie after seeing her in my bed why tf are you in my bed with my cat and I told you not to go up there... gtf out of my house
i got second-hand stress and triggered-ness from watching this.
Literally in the first 6 minutes of the video I thought I’m already in the middle of the video😂🤦🏻‍♀️
We def need a part two!!
- oh and the parents can literally ALWAYS tell if something shady is up with a “friend” of yours before you can 😭 Been there done that lol
Aren’t compulsive liars meant to be good at lying??
DRAMA AND NOODLES
WE NEED A PART 2
I would've confronted The girls, lol it's okay though..I've been through it. Love you Eva!!
I can relate to this and my parents were right too 
 





But I found new friends
About the party I would be like NO and if she wouldn’t listen and would still make all the people come I would lock my doors and windows
2:11 okay girl all things aside. How did you managed to look that good at 14!? I'm 14 as well and I'm like tHiCc and I can't even wear bekini it just looks....you know
Sad life sobs
20:11 Jan 2nd is my birthday 😂
Who else feels bad for Eva?
👇
k but like why let her house sit then🤔
I can't watch this stuff... It makes me to angry 😂
Ah.. you are too naive and too good... You had to get rid both off them long time ago.. I really wanted to shake you off  while listening your story. :D
Eva i just need to tell you that you are a VERY inspiring person and that all of us are with you in this kind of FRICKING CRAZY situation!!!😆 We love you sssssoooooo much!!❤🌈❤❤
I love you so much Eva, you don't deserve any of this. Keep being strong girl!
This is a lot of tea you need some more. Story’s
Thank you Eva for helping Australia save its reef. I am so proud of you and I am such a huge fan. I honestly don’t know how I would life w/o your amazing content and support. Thank you for being such an amazing role model.
When u said she posted all that I would’ve beat her a*s
Girl why didn't you change your bed sheets in so long?
I just realised my ‘best friend’ of 5 years has been emotionally abusing me.
Fun, right?
wait the playlist was made on August 12, 2018?
Have you noticed that when ever she moves her head her ponytail swings
As an average Australian who cares about the environment, thank you for caring about our Great Barrier Reef and working to preserve it. Personally I really appeciate it.
Literally just saw the first 3 seconds of this video and subscribed. My kind of person haha
"cus your period doesn't come out your frickin ear" 😂😂
I WOULD KILL THEM BOTH
not literally but they are jerks
Your hair looks cute gurl💓
This is mean but if someone has used you and pretend that their your friend:
Step 1. Dig up some dirt on them.
Step 2. Wait a little
Step 3.(the fun part)EXPOSE👏🏻 THEIR👏🏻ASS
Step 4: celebration dance🕺🏻💃🏻🖕🏻
Awww u are literally the best u think the best of everyone even tho they do u sooo bad ❤️❤️❤️🥳😈
I feel like your channel is the definition of 2015. Even now lol






not hating just an observation lmao
Thanks for posting this ❤️ Hope this sends a message to pathological liars to stop manipulating other girls and leave them alone!
We want a part 2
I can't believe you trusted her with your house!!!! WOOOOOW GIRL!!!!!
This why nobody but my family are allowed in my personal space! periodt
i need a part two, oh my god, i got so into this😂 I WATCHED EVERY SECOND
You bounce off such great energy. It's good that you have such kind friends to lookout for you especially if others is possibly using you as a means to an end.
I just finished my friendship with my best friend that lied a lot too. I knew her since I was 4.
This is so funny, watching non germans saying schnitzel as a german. But you're doing great 😂❤️
If she texted me about the 20$ I would text her back and say "ok I will once you give me 50$ for the cat ears and 500$ for the coffee table"
I felt so heated throughout this whole video uuuuugghh 😤😤😤😤😤
THIS NEEDS TO BE A BOOK.
biggest plot twist: IT WAS HER MOM
How did you stay calm and so nice to they,, I would be so pissed 😤😂
OMG THERE ARE NO SEATBELTS ON THE TOILET
I think u should make a podcast!❤️🙌🏽
Doesn’t have fragile decor like a vase but has a glass coffee table 😂❤️
*your (neighbors)
WHERE IS EVAS TOP FROM?! I NEED IT
I need a part 2 lol
You sould do a pause challenge with brent 😀😂
i was here since one hour hearing this and this story is amazing and i DON'T HAVE MY Period i am so worried know that you said
I was like, "I am not gonna watch this whole thing, it is 34 minutes!" I find myself watching this and the part 2😂 It is so interesting
Thank god I don't have 'friends' :P
Wtf? Carrie's twisted 🙄🙄
So prettttttyyy 💛💛💛
She’s so pretty lawdd
does she actually have a photographic memory??
Thanks for sharing. Very entertaining. Moral of the story: stand your ground, grow a spine and open your mouth AS SOON as someone tries to step on you!
Okay sorry but what Eva meant was HAVEN'T PEOPLE 3VER HEARD OF CLOSING THE GODDAM DOOR, NO.
1:25 Pshhh YOLO😂
did you change your doorlock
Eva: Yeah sure (just being so nice)

Me: Kills them as soon as they get drunk


This happened to my mother I hated that women (who was lying and stealing form my mom)
You’re 👏too👏 nice👏
You sure we werent friends with the same girls?? Lmfao I relate so hard with this
The dislikes are her crew 💀
Yea, post on Facebook that you'll be out of town and the specific days you'll be out of town 😂😂 smart
I absolutely love your story times!
Carrie: "She understands the value of money.. she would never do anything like steal your make up."


Hint hint, she stole the make up


Edit: thanks for all the likes haha 🥰🥰
This just pissed me off. 😂😂😂
drama and noodles 😂
I have a fake friend, (she's still my friend.) and I never stopped being her friend cause... I have no friends.
My life is great 😒
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN LET CARRIE HOUSE SIT AFTER THE WHOLE PARTY SITUATION
I think Eva should make a vid with James Charles
Did she really says,, schnitzel „?
You could gust get a lie detector test on the girls to figure out who stole it.
the audacity of these girls... it's absolutely appalling!!
I think it’s great what you are doing for the earth I admire you
TEA PARTY🎉
Ok totally random question but the picture right you and the bear, was that taken at Huntington Beach
Does anyone remember the movie Carrie and like how she can control blood or something because ppl made fun of her when she had her period during school tehe.....present day- FBI... I think we found her
.
.
.
.

Why’d did I just say this
This is my little brother 
One like equals 1 year
👇🏻
 👦🏻
 👕

something good my bff has done is she said yes to dating me,(LGBTQ+ I am a girl also).
Eva's subtitles 6:39 : YOU'rE neighbors won't care ' lmao

My aunt's name is Carrie. We call her Aunt Ca. XD
That was too.....much DRAMA. I'm tired.
How'd you trust her more than once...eva gives too many chances to this girl
I feel so pissed after watching your rant
Hearing this makes me mad at you !!.....
WE NEED PART 2
GIMMIE PART TO RNNNN
You have to do part 2
i ask this  every video but WHERE IS PARIS???
Me and Carrie would've had to square up. I'm an introvert; I ain't with all that.
“YOU KNOW WHAT......maybe”😂😂
I wish that was me because I would literally GO OFF ON HER I would’ve no joke
Hey eyebrow bother me
What the hell you have such amazing friends where can I get some
I stopped paying attention to my bff of 4 years and hanged out with my “popular” bffs 
She then found new bffs and now we’re drifting apart
I don’t even think I’m her Friend anymore...
Aside your minty green stunning outfit💜... holly GOD AND MARRY what in hell were they thinking
OMG PART 2
13:35 thats so me 😂
oh my god eva you deserve to post this video!!!

Girl you are GLOWING✨ Also, what lipstick are you wearing, it’s gorgeous😍
When you said it doesnt come out your ear , i lit spat out my soda cuz i laughed xD xx
You’re too nice dude lol
eva was way too nice and trustworthing
My best friend took care of me for two weeks to a month after I had surgery.
If someone stole my makeup I would flip my shit on them because I have multiple like 50$ products and a James Charles morphe  pallet so try me I dare you
Edit: she liked it I’m having a heart attack love u Eva
That happens to to me with friends can you a advice video
i love your curly hair 🤩😍
For the Facebook thing you should’ve been like someone is already taking care of your cat....
i am dealing with crazy people
IVE BEEN THERE. omg. Some people lie so much they believe in their lies.
WTF GIRL. At a certain point in this video, the way you’re treated becomes your fault
you are too nice, I would have lost my shit from the beginning
Every time “Carrie” or “Taylor” did something and u had the opportunity to like respond I was like “EVVAAA CALL THOSE FREAKING GIRLS OUT!!!!” I wanted to slap them through the screen lol. 

Ps. U look so pretty! ♥️
woah, what a liar. btw the vibe of the pictures are so aesthetic.
Ohhh myyy gooooodddd 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
PART 2!!
I need this “Carrie’s” insta or smth because girlllllllllll😤

Carrie gets period blood everywhere
The movie Carrie she was bullied for having a period and not knowing what it was. Coincidence?
You need a Vivint home security system lol
This is why I only have 5 good friends now
Is it just me or do you ever think the names they used are their actual names
18:36 drama and noodles lmao
THE TEA IS SO REAL I COULD NOT STOP GASPING

Her eyebrows bother me
Hello Eva I know you are probably not gonna see this but I have been a fan for 3 years and I would really love it if you and me could be bffs pls reply
We have the Same name but my is spelt differently but it’s pronounced the same
Imagine being with Carrie as she is watching this 😂😂😂
I love this I want to see the part 2
After Eva said my make up bag is gone and I start like, an add played and said:drinking tons of water so put those two together and this is what I heard :my make up bag is gone so I start like drinking tons of water 😂😂😂😂
Omg am I the only who gets defensive about their parents talking about their friends 😭
who she talkin bout
Giiiiirl omfg. As soon as you started talking about someone house sitting im like PLEASE TELL ME SHE DOESNT HAVE CARRY DO IT. Lol lesson learned.
I literally would have been gone after the first thing that happened
I need the other video
30:19 foreshadowing the ghost storytime
You are so nice cus I would of thrown hands cus people get killed for less 🤷🏽‍♀️😂
I wish I had your patience, I would have beat them up after the coffee table and makeup thing
WHY DO THERE 1.9K PEOPLE NOT HAVE GLASSES YET?
Nice thing a friend has done for me:
I once accidentally threw out my sketchbook in the lunchroom, and it was like, covered in shit in the trash, and my best friend just got up while I'm having an emotional breakdown at our table,  stuck her arm in the trashcan in front of EVERYONE, pulled out my sketchbook,  and walked back to our table while cleaning it up with a paper towel. I love her so much!
"drama and noodles"
I love you I’ve been watching you since 2013 and I still love you I’m happy that you told that girl off ❤️❤️
I used to have a friend that used to lie, turn my friends against me, and bully me, then the next day she would be sweet and kind like nothing happened!! When I asked her about it she would turn on me, again
Part 2 please
Part 2! Part 2! Part 2!
what's RSVP
Parents are ALWAYS right about edgy friends. Remember ALWAYS. ALWAYS! stay safe 😁👍🏻
If I was you Eva I would BEAT THE S* OUT CARRIE AND B* SLAP HER AND THROW HER ON A WALL!!
the intense music is soo intense...😂😭😭
High key want to see Carrie and Taylor reaction to this video
I wonder if Eva still goes to church
Jesus Christ if this was me dealing with Carrie or Taylor I would have given them both a slap on day one and never talk to either of them again lmao
I'm here for you Eva Im in the same token can you give me some advice please
I love u my girl
You have sooooo much patients! I would just kick them out of my life immediately!
I. am. so. friking. triggered and pissed-.-
I WAS BORN IN ORANGE COUNTY

mY wHoLe LiFe Is TuRnInG iNtO dRaMa AnD nOoDlEs!

I had a friend like this 🙄
I want a part 2 now!
You should invest in cameras....
Lol straight up 
Absolutely no one:


Eva: if you have a friend who you keep having weird crap like this with
Get out
😂
Currently in one of these friendships 😒
My name is Carrie 😂
I totally relate
this happened tome
Okay but like, you look GORGEOUS in this video 😂❤️
I was so triggered the whole time
Ok but ur top is cute tho
This is just a thought but you should film a video with carry (lie detector)
HOW YOU CAN BE SO CALM!!!!!!!
part 2 pls
Lmao it would be funny and amusing to you and all of us to just IMAGINE:

If you invite "Carrie" and "Taylor" for a video and it's a



SURPRISE LIE DETECTOR CHALLENGE🤣❤️
Love you, eva, DON'T DO IT, THOUGH!, And stay strong❤️



Edit: Thanks for all the likes again omggg😭😭😭
This entire video is so aesthetically pleasing wowza sis
the way carrie talks in those facebook posts annoy me
My mom went through the same thing! And she was like warning me to always be careful with my close friends!
So close to 10million we can do this evanators we need the 10 million subscribers for Eva and the future of the Eva world!
Who else raced straight to the comments.....just Me ?
what is her ethnicity??? Just wanna know, it won't effect wether I keep watching her or not since I've been a long time viewer. She just looks ethnic
omg carrie if ur name gets said again i will blow. (except for part 2)
You had some evil friends
I want Carrie's insta because i am going to kill her...
Lesson learned: ur parents are ALWAYS right
Are you butiful . Read backwards
I wold have killed 3 people already at min 24:00
omg my name is eva too and had a friend who used me too
The exact same thing happened to me in middle school, one of my best friends stole all of my lacrosse gear: about 2,000€ worth of equipment, and I had to search his room to find it. I never trusted him again .
Parents bro.... I was best friends with a girl and my parents didn't like her. And it was sad but 4 months later I found out she lied to me about something to do with social media and so we never talked to eachother again. Kids shouod really listen to parents. They no.
Eva you should of slapped her duh XD
Listen, my ex friend was nice but then mean to me and he pooped on my couch and laughed at me so what should I do? I think I should tell him but he may poop on the couch again in response.







Like if you can relate

I love her story times... bc I can relate lol. Ik too many sociopaths
how did you not confront her lol I would've cracked
One day me and my friend where fighting because she liked a boy that i liked but i told her to stop fighting with me because this is stupid until the next day i figured out that the boy that i liked has a crush on me i couldn't tell her because this fight well get a lot worse so i didn't tell her then after one week she noticed because he was hanging with me all the time at recuss so she told my good friend what is wrong with him why is he playing with her. She said that there are friends but she though we were in a relationship but the person that i hated told her that he liked me so the fight got a little bit to far but i explained everything and then after a week or so me and her became friends but the boy that had a crush in me is my friend but i don't really hang with him a lot i hang out with my friends and the people that care about me that how my story is but it is a little bit longer i just don'y want you to ready this like for an hour so this is my story about a situation that was way tooooo far thx for your time and thx for reading this i am so sorry that it is long but thank you byeee

OMFFFGGGGGGGGGGG this story LITERALLY GAVE ME HIVES the ENTIRE time lmaooooooo 

Cannot stand girls like that smh 😓
I am homeschooled because of that reason😞(I have no friends)
Dis girl named Carrie needs jail
Are you a pisces?
eva: finds something cute
eva: it would look so cute ~cropped~
I love how you guys call it “THE goodwill” 😂😂
"This would look cute cropped...but if it was cropped...i think im gonna crop this...just hear me out, like if this was cropped...this will be so cute if i cropped it" moral of the story clothes will always look better cropped😂
the main point of this video. 

“if it was cropped. . .”
I bought 30 things at goodwill today & it was only $52.28
Eva: "Money does not mean that you look good"
Eva 5 mins later: "Grab the balenciagas!!!"
Tbh I would prefer the red dress the way it was. It would've looked super classy during winters as an overcoat.
What. In. The. World. was that intercom guy saying?
And just like that, 10 million teens were mobilized to shop their local Goodwill. It’s the most ethical way to shop. I love this. Way to use your influence 🤙🏻
Eva: walking around in her Louis Vuitton purse in GoodWill
Just want to go to America so I can go to good will 😩 our charity shops are really overpriced
lol, you don't have to crop everything!
Take a shot every time she says “if this was cropped.”
girl PLEASE do more Goodwill videos 🙌🏼😩 thrift store for the win
I think Eva can just pull anything off
we really need appreciate the videography of the look book damn
can we appreciate the videography?? 🤩
Omg girl that long purple floral skirt that was turned into a 2 piece  insta baddie outfit was 🔥🔥🔥👏🏾✨
who else loves thrifting?!  🙋🏻‍♀️
The good will? I’ve never heard it called that before😂 (I call it “goodwill”)
I love how she is like "This will be cute cropped" on every single one in a good way
nobody : 
eva : if it was cropped
Yass girl let em knowwww! I was rockin champion before everyone lol
Anyone know who that song was by during the end... around 11:53
7:29 that looks like my school shirt 🤣 (I wear a uniform)
I know how to tailor clothes and I'm not screaming, I'm actually laughing 😂
literally no one:
Eva: LeT's CrOp It!!!
Moral of the story: Anything can be cute if you crop it 😭
I’ve never been in a goodwill.....
We all learned a fact:
Eva likes everything cropped 
😂😂she is even wearing cropped 
Lol
REACT TO BRENTS LATEST VIDEOOO PLLSS
Can anybody tell where is the  music from

Okay so I was actually curious about that Mickey Mouse sweater so I looked it up and on one website it was titled “1990 vintage Mickey sweater” and was being sold for nearly $200💀 moral of the story:

“If It WaS cRoPpEd”
-EvA
Damn, Eva’s looking so pretty in this vid 😍

It's so frustrating when people think everything good/better is what cost the most
plz do a week wearing only the goodwill clothes you made
“Money does not mean that u look good”
Rolls up in Porsche 😂😂😂
When you are wearing white, you looks so bomb! That's a lit
The end looks like some high quality  music video  .. .. ..😍😍❤👍

eva you said cropped 9 times i counted
No one:
Eva: if it was cropped...
People in America are soo lucky you have goodwill and we don't!😟
Who was here early for Eva’s awesome video? 🙋🏻‍♂️ ❤️ #GoodWillEdition :)

Everything looks so good on you 😍
Champion used to be sold at Costco too like recently actually a couple years ago
DRINK how many times she says "iF iT was CrOePd"
Ava you just love crops huh btw love you 💕 💗
Girl where are your leggings from 🤭
So good to see a youtuber who isnt making everyone jealous by shopping at Gucci 😂❤️
Moral of the story


iF iT wAs CrOpPeD
Goodwill is my favorite store. 😄 also, that lookbook portion had me internally screaming: ACTUAL QUEEN!!
I have that Mickey sweatshirt because it used to be my moms #vintage
The first goodwill you went to doesn't have the best stuff...
OMG I would love the top that says "not much really just my life" it would be so cool when you put as Eva, Also Eva is a great name
Ave I love you sooooo much I wish I could see you in person but I live in England. I am you biggest fan. You are my inspiration. ❤️❤️💕😁
This video is like the perfect mix of old youtube and new youtube! I got old eva vibes but in new eva form! I loved it!
I shop at Hollister 😂😂
Could you make a video where you open fan dm's?😁
Can you a diy of all of the things that you got at the Goodwill 
Who else agrees
I am obessed with the outro😍
I see it 
I like it
I want it 
I bought it
At goodwill! ♡
"THE goodwill"?
its "goodwill" 😂
I used to be a fan of The Wild Thornberrys <3
YOU'RE DI BEAUTY AND CUTEEE I LIVE UUU♡♡♡
loved this video so much 😍 totally going to try shopping there now ❤️
I found a champian shirt from the good will for 1 dollar and was brand new!!
That goodwill is more expensive than the ones I see in Illinois and Indiana, but I figured it would be lol. Tops are $4, bottoms are $4, jackets and dresses are $5-6 unless stated otherwise and most shoes are $4. Name brands will be a few dollars more or things that are new
Ok, I have my bell turn on and YouTube never told me that my QUEEN Eva uploaded a video! How dare you YouTube!!!!!!
Could I have the shirt that says NOTHING MUCH BUT  MY LIFE?
“Growing up I was poor” legit.
Imagine just looking into your closet and you have no regular length shirts just crop tips
This is why I love thrift shopping I do this all the time , I save my self so much money and I get cute stuff for little money ❤️😭
Love the lil plaster at the back of your thigh hahahaha
Can we talk about the white outfit Eva was wearing? It's S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G! 😍
Bring reusable bags with you! Leave them in the car, no plastic x
I found a brand new pair of white converse in my size yesterday. I was so fricken happy
I asked my mom if we could go to good will she said "u dont want to go to Target or something?"
ok this is a random thought but if eva was an actress then she would look really good in like an action movie. she has that badass look
This is one of my goodwills! Although I never heard that announcer guy wtf lol
*walks into goodwill with a LV bag*
eva... i would sooo wear the last one DIYed
I love Goodwill. Mine has $1 Thursday’s on specific tags. I love it occasionally lol You got good stuff 😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
I AM FROM SERBIA AND I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE SO P E R F E C T, LOVE YOU EVA 🌐

You should have gone on the $1 thursdays or the sale days. Most of my wardrobe is $5 and under. And i have like $100 jackets in my closet
Absolutely hate when someone is wearing the same thing as me
Play a game: every time she says “this would look so good cropped” or 6.49 do something lol I don’t know what. Haha
oh wait... "my receipts be looking like phone numbers" 💀😂
we love a thrift queen
So i work at goodwill and we collect medical equipment. If you need it we give it to u for free

I got red jeans for $2.99 at goodwill on Friday 🤠
Atleast someone in the youtube "community" spends their money right like  : on making memories, travelling and making ppl happy , instead of spending their money on things like parties, gucci... Other famous ppl will use a 100 + dollars for just a belt, socks...  I know it is their money but, be a little bit aware of what you buy and don't forget that we are the reason you can pay yr bills .💜💜 tnx eva for making that clear and being planet friendly/vegan and making the world a better place by making good Choices 💜💜 (btw im not SHADING )
I think you should do a 48 hours dating Brent
"GUYS LOOK AT THE STUFF YOU CAN STYLE FROM THE GOODWILL"... WITH BALENCIAGAs AND LOUIS VOITTON

BRENT IS CHEATING ON YOU!!

I MISS YOU WHATS WRONG
I love how Eva isn’t ashamed of her past life and struggles. Humble beginnings!!♥️♥️
Have you seen Brent’s new vid
My heart cried everytime you cut something omg you need to leave more seam allowance or you can't fix it. I was SCREECHING in my head about this while watching lol

I love comfortable Eva is with her body I feel like I am always a little awkward when I wear a crop top
I'm sorry, but you just literally killed that yellow sweater. It was so nice and now it's all gone. 😢😢
If we drink every time Eva says ‘CROPED’ I’m almost certain I’d be drunk. Hahahahahaha
Good will is looking pretty good and fresh right now
The announcer was funny af 😂😂😂
Okay but is nobody going to talk about how aesthetic her house is?!!!!!! THIS is my dream home 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Saludos desde Colombia 🇨🇴

Wow... How can u do that eva.. I like ur taste
My goodwill sucks its so dirty and unorganized soooo expensive
Did anyone else realise she said jeans but they were shorts...? 5:54  

Just me?
me, trying to put my money to good use: scrambling through a hot topic, h&m, forever 21, and spencers
eva, being a literal queen: going to Goodwill and spending 100 dollars. Then, coming out like if she went to H&M and had a shopping spree
She speaks faster than JoJo siwa
yes that is so true shop at the guys section i found cute t shirts
Now I really want to go there
Bargain shopping at it’s best!!!!!💕💕💕
I'm OBSESSED with the Mickey Mouse sweatshirt
I'm glad someone said it

#MyLifeAsEva
What lipstick do you use it looks so cute ❤️🥰
Hi Eva! I just want to say that you make me SO happy by just living your best, and happy life. You really deserve all this, cause you worked damn hard! I am so proud of you Eva! :) By the way, I love your 'My Life as Eva shirt' idea Lolol. And I feel like everyone would want it 💙
Go kill Brent because of his new video
Why does everything have to be cropped I love u Eva but u love showing ur stomach don’t u
I’ve never really thought about buying clothes from GW but I’ve always donating. Shopping there would be fun with a friend and the diy it
8:26 new merch idea
I love shopping at goodwil
CAN I HAVE THE SHIRT I WANT IT😭😭😭
#Roadto10MSubs
Really Eva i think that you should
Love you soo much Eva
You look so good in red!
Yes but will she ever wear any of this again?
I think my favorite was the yellow sweater
that's so much
Eva, your sense of humor always brings my day back from a 4 to a 11!
Ooh I love the bts portion!! 😂😊
Oh my fav Macklemore song is Glorious also what’s your fav one
Micky mouse shirt was hella cute
I shop at the thrift store because that's what I can afford and the kids at school go to the thrift store for "fun". Also savers is a great store too!
Anyone else feel bad thrifting? I feel like I’m taking away good clothes from someone who may really need them. Idk
she's gonna get robbed at THE goodwill so she's gonna be losing 100 dollars 😂
I personally love that matching top and skirt purple pinkish flower one and that red one gives that cute geek look which you are totally SLAYING QUEEN! 👑
#SCHNITZELSQUAD
SHE got a PORCHE wow......
EVA YOURE CUTE AND SO IS BRENT BUT TOGETHER YOU ARE PLAIN POO 💩  #WEDONTSHIPBREVA #SUBSCRIBETOUS
Next time bring reusable bags when you go shopping!!
Ur so cute omg
count how many times she says cropped
We love a queen who saves money
Why dose she look good in Literally anything
I love the Mickey sweater 💕 it’s so cute!! And I love that you turned the purple skirt into a two piece outfit!
Oof Eva is mad at Brent
Hey which is the song from the lookbook 11:52 ?
You get better stuff at goodwill than you do any store. It’s amazing. 🙌🏽
Would’ve gotten you 100 items on Sunday at my local goodwill
You have such sense of fashion compared to that Lila girl who looks like a young hippy.
I got a $4 button up blue jean skirt at a thrift store today! I forget the name bc it was my first time there. I like goodwill.
Also this is such a good idea, i think im gonna go out now and htu
So I Did A Little Research About The Items I Liked In This Video And The Mickey Mouse Sweater Was Titled As A 1990 Vintage Sweater For $90 And The brand Was “ Ellie Mae “.
Hi do you play roblox because I met someone who said this was their channel but there name was marie161314.
Love you😘❤️😘
If I had a dollar for every time Eva said “if I cropped this” I wouldn’t have to shop at Goodwill anymore 😂
Aha I love the good will 😄
One time at Nordstrom Rack my sister and I  bought a dress for a penny! Originally at Nordstrom it was 115$ but at Nordstrom Rack it was 50$ and since my sister got a discount we only payed a penny lmao.
does anyone know what song was used for the look book section???
How much for the custom DIY sweatshirt😂
I fricken love Goodwill!!!!
Most used phrase "This cropped would look so cute"
Evaaaaaaa 💕💕💕💕💕
If you give it to me say as Ava that’s my name 😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂
i love how she was wearing an outfit from good will while cropping her clothes
I have no idea if you are going to see this but if you do could you please tell me where did your morning routine 2019 video go???
Yassssssss QUEEN

I love your fashion can you help me I want your number to text and talk to you and I really want you and Brent to get together y’all are so cute together I really hope you respond
My goodwill freaking sucks 😂
really cool that you did this eva 😇 all of the luxury stuff is fun to see but this is real and i think way more relatable for everyone watching (also really ethical to buy from the thrift store!) you're using your influence in an awesome way ❤️
i totally think the last fit in the lookbook would be sooo cute on like winter break at a cabin idk
lol, I don't think Eva knows what pop some tags means!
wtf is that sound in the background
yellow sweater!!! gooooo girl!!!!
you should paint the back of the jean jacket!! it’s a super cute trend rn
Goodwill really likes .49 cent
I don’t know anything about clothes but this video taught me that essentially everything looks cute if you crop it.
Litterally got a designer skirt at goodwill a while ago
Omg that look book was soooooooo good
You and Brent are NOT JUST FRIENDS!❤️❤️
I love her motivation 😍😍😍😍😍

Good idea maybe some new shorts.
Why hasn’t she posted in 3 weeks (no hate, just wondering) 💘😊

Anyone else want to go to goodwill now?😂😂😂
Norma people constantly wanting to crop clothes but I can’t find any T-shirt’s or sweaters long enough anyway
I went to GoodWill!!!!!! I got some awesome pants there!!
#SchnitzelSquad
Goodwill is for people who can’t afford clothes from other places. millionaires shouldn’t be taking the good clothes away from those who really need it.
Omg. My sister just met her at the mall.😁😍
Look at these shoes, they’d look good cropped 👀😂
Hi Eva can we be friends im from the Philippines
Take a shot every time she says “If this was cropped”  




...plz don’t. You’ll die.
She wants to crop everything
Do something like that again.

I loveee that you went to Goodwill, fast fashion is terrible contribution to our landfills. I am glad that you inspire me and your audience that thrift stores should be our number one shop. It is also a great way to start or continue a sustainable life style! Steps to saving our planet!!!!
i’ve chosen to start only shopping at thrift stores pretty recently! better for the environment + finally re-teaching myself how to alter things too!
hey eva love ya,just wanted to ask you if you and Brent are a ciuple i know u did a vid on it but i still dont quite understand,see ya

Hey, can I get that "My Life" sweater? No, like seriously. Hmu on Tumblr.
I have that exact same Micky Mouse sweater
Omg the part where your family disguised the name ''Goodwill'' so people wouldnt know haha! My parents would code name it: ''The Macy's''
You said u will kiss Brent in a million subs
DIY some of the clothes
Goodwill has that smell when you enter or is it just me?
I would love to see a video, of your sister dressing you for a week. 😄😄😄

Does anyone else think that she looks like Moana in her intro??
10:05
I want the “merch”
The back round music  after she cropped the outfits sounds like I miss u itunes
Eva after this video: literally crops everything she bought 😂
Was anyone else wondering how much the look book at the end turned Brent on when he saw this?

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
find the longest vine video ever than mark it so the people at you-tube have to watch the entire thing
Lol I almost got an oversized yellow sweater at a thrift store today
Awesome looks. Honestly I never buy things at goodwill because I dont want to take all the cute stuff away from people who actually cant afford to shop somewhere else. I feel guilty if I do!
“The” goodwill
I don't have any goodwill or thriftshop in my country, maybe there is but I never found it 😐
Where have you been the last few weeks
Brent went on a bare with an other girl
When I was young I got Almost everything from goodwill bc my dad worked over time and my mom has chron disease so u can actually find some cute stuff there
“The goodwill” the the the the.
Have you watched Brent’s latest video.....
I went to the Goodwill in my town and the stuff they had was t-shirts saying “2006 Chess Tournament” with a bunch of names I’ve NEVER heard of
Ill take it
I’ll take the sweatshirt
Pause it at 2:42!
Woahhh I know short dresses are her style but I think she cut the dresses to short but she cuteee
when i go thrifting i get 100 pieces for 100$
Can I have the sweatshirt
You seem to be very good at managing your body.
my name is Eva
Brent is not your boyfriend
‘the goodwill’
💞
Can I have the shirt
omg, I literally just cleaned out my closet, like DEEP clean, I got rid of like 10 bags of clothes and shoes.  I wanted to go shopping for a new wardrobe at the mall but my college bank account laughed at me.  This whole time there's been a GW like 5 minutes away from my house.  I'm so gonna go check it out!!
Omg ur goodwill is so nice. Mine is so scary and theres not that nice of clothes there
Anyone know a shop like goodwill in Germany?
My mom loves the outfits
what is she wearing in this video at the beginning because i wanttttt xxx
Lol the way she was jean jacket
Really cute clothes Eva!
the red dress was bomb :)
She is super sexy
Yeah people just donate brand new stuff like I got brand new adidas trainers today for like £20 cx
Song?
❤️ To the 1% who are gonna see this i wish you realize your biggest dream. My dream is to become a successful youtuber. ❤️
Goodwill only works if you like long-sleeved, oversized shirts. I live in Florida and get hot easily. You might find 2/3 things, but normal shirts are hard to get.
goodwill was my childhood clothing staple! and it’s so true, thrifting was looked down on/too cheap but it’s so different now!!!
Anyone else really want that crewneck that is her “merch”
where do u get ur wigs
Was anyone else getting really annoyed that she kept saying ‘the Goodwill’ not just ‘Goodwill’ 🙄🙄 Idk that just really annoyed me 😂 not trying to be rude, just my opinion
Why do u want everything to be so short
not like as like as a friend but like as a girl friend lol ( alexs does not the  other one)
Hey
Brent cheated on you he has a girlfriend now watch his video
You and Brent still need to kiss kiss kiss life if you want them to kiss
EVA BRENT IS CHEATING.......well I guess you aren’t together but stilllll.......HE HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND CALLED LAUREN
Brent has a girlfriend now
Like if you saw Brent’s new friend
Isn’t Eva mad that Brent kissed a different girl in his lastest video
What song at 11:52 pls?
What do you use to Editttt
That is the booshiest Goodwill I have ever seen. Seriously at my Goodwill she could've gotten all of that for like 35-40 dollars. (Excuse me I can't spell)
So so cute
The yellow sweatshirt
“Seam you in the comments!” 
Me:silently crying 😢
Are u gonna crop everything
At my local GW we only have like grandma clothes. Like the ones that died and their family took their clothes there.... you got lucky af
I want it
Girl plsss don’t crop everything some stuff you gotta let be it’s self like that red trench coat thing when you said you were gonna crop it I was like nooooooooooo just let some stuff be and sometimes you just got to go with your own flow and stay away from some  trends
Wish I had money
💟😊
Ok the the goodwills in Cali are so much better than the ones where I live 🤧 all the girls I see on yt always find amazing things and im mind blown. All we have is outdated Aeropostale shirts and weird tank tops 😭
Breva
Hi
Great video!
watching this at school as i’m wearing a men’s purple sweater from a thrift store that i cropped
all of my goodwills are really bad lolll
Not to be rude but sometimes she really girly or really tomboy....
Did anyone else get an add when it said and now at 11:47?
did anyone else notice the band aid on the back of her leg?
great video!
Girl go on Thursday the color of the week is a dollar and I’ve gotten full outfits like today is double dip so there’s two colors I went ham today
that noise behind the camera when she was showing the clothes was driving me crazy
I was basically just staring at your earrings the whole time. They're so cute!
Looking bougie on a budget is always a good time!!
Eva!!! You should totally have Brent guess goodwill vs. expensive brand! That would be so much fun and really show kids that they can go to the thrift stores and still look amazing. Plus, if Brent can’t  tell the difference, I doubt your classmates will. 😃😁
What the hech??? How did you get those things at GOODWILL... Like WTF😂 I LOVE YOU GIRL❤❤
Hi! I know that you probably won't read this but why did you took of your morning routine video?  Personally it really inspired me and helped me a lot. Love u
what a queen🖤
Wow you like croping ahahhahh
What happened to the my life as Eva sweater???
that lookbook though!
lol 6.50$ is literally expensive for a goodwill
Few years ago when i discovered your channel i thought the name of your channel was "mylifeiseva" and i thought well that's weird and it doesn't make any sense. then one day i realized it's mylifeaseva and i felt so dumb🤦🏻‍♀️
This is so goooood
What would a 100$ get a homeless person?
The red dress was so cute!!!!!!! 🤩 love you so much!!
Am I the only one who thinks that whatever Eva wears looks good on her?
I have never herd Eva say a kinda bad word
thrift shops are very different in australia, i guess it's due to the smaller population, but the cheapest thing that you could find that would match any of the style and quality you showed in the video would be around $15-$20AUD.
We don’t have a goodwill 😭 but we do have primark wich is a really cute cheap clothing store that EVERYONE goes to. They even sell cheap but really good makeup.
I felt anxious when she starts cutting like craaazyy but this video is like amazingg girl. I wish I've Goodwill back in my country
I see it
I like it 
I want it
I croped it
Champion jumpers are $80 in New Zealand. And also I just found out my jumper is Abercrombie is a brand got it for free as a present.
Me:
Eva: BuT If tHiS wERe CROPPED
Basically, 
Clothing+cropping= HIGH FASHUN
Seriously girl u have done it .loved the vid 😉😉.lov from India .❤❤
My favorite piece was the shorts!! Love you Eva <3

BREAVA😍❤️😍❤️

shane dawson who
WHY CUT ALL THE CLOTHES?! NOOOO THAT SKURT WAS AMAZING LOOOONG, AND DE RED COAT/DRESS. Yisus Everything long is more couture.
I didn’t recognize her in the thumbnail until I saw her name
I use to hate you but now I have a new YouTube love you
Peep the bandaid on the back of her leg
Well I mean goodwill in california is a heck of a lot different than what you see in Delaware...
Omg you could totally be a MODEL😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg yes I love thrifting so much omg
Where did you get your clothes? there are sooo nicee 😍😍 Love youuu♥️
From shopping at goodwill to driving a Porsche and carrying an LV purse omg! Never give up on your dreams guys; Eva really proved this 💖💖
I love goodwill, but I'm sad that they don't have one in New Zealand :(
Good will is my fav
With the yellow jumper Adeline morin is ShOoK
the yellow sweater made me drop all my uwus omg
That red dress was sososo cute
WHAT WAS THE BAG/PURSE YOU HAD IN THIS VIDEO?!?
Take a shot every time she says chop / chopped, then check into the hospital..
Holy cow! That’s an expensive goodwill. At the GW here sweatshirts are $2.99
😂❤️love u G
I go to the thrift store,buy some clothes then wash it
OnLy 17?!
It’s almost annoying how pretty Eva is...SHARE THE ATTRACTIVE WEALTH!! PLEASE!!!!❤️😂
Idk why people freak out about good will or thrifting, youre only finding cute stuff if someone else bought the expensive thing, had good taste but out grew it got tired etc then youre buying the same stuff from the mall just discounted because someone basically wanted to trash it xD Youre cute looks are only as good as the first persons style taste and money..
cropped cropped and cropped
Breva
When she says something is too long but it’s too short for you and yo mamma would kill you if she saw you wearing it.
You are so beautiful Eva!❤️❤️😍🥰🥰
Didn't know this was supposed to be a challenge until the end!!!
Can you do another thrift haul plesseeeeeee❤️❤️❤️
Brent is shakingggg
Do another video of you DIYing the stuff!
I felt the intro I only shop at goodwill I’m to broke to shop anywhere else 😂
I remember wearing champion in elementary school and getting picked on and now the kids that picked on me are flexing in champion, ironic
Why does she need to crop ever thing some of those already look good normally
Good will for life!!!!! That's the only place I shop!!! Btw that hoodie is cute....😝😝
I’m lowkey mad that she posted this because now everyone will go to Goodwill for clothes and there won’t be as many good clothes anymore!😂
I went to Goodwill 3 times this week because I had such good luck! A couple months ago, I found a Coach bag that originally retailed for I believe around $358, but at goodwill I paid $9.99 total.  Love this video🙌❤️!!!
14:32
i love love love thrifting! Grew up the same, not a lot of money to afford clothes and i was honestly a little embarassed. But now I own it, i'm proud of it, I'm saving money and the environment. 


Also, I have a youtube channel dedicated to thrifting if any of you guys want to check it out. <3
00:01 EXCUSE ME ARE THOSE... WIRED AIRPODS ??
All the clothes less than $10 and then a designer handbag 😂😂
4:09
I watch videos like these and I get motivated to go to the thrift store then when I get there I don't see any of this stuff n I live in la so I thought people who would donate would have the good stuff but nope it's grandma clothes and toddler jumpers
12 year old me: gets 4 dollars and walks around like a queen
Still 12 year old me: gets 20 dollars and walks into Gucci ...mom drags out of store you can’t buy anything with in here with 20 bucks ....goes to primark  and comes back with a million things and where’s them everyday like a pro hahahahaa
When I see videos like this on YouTube I get inspired to go to goodwill but there’s nothing good there. Probably because I live in the Midwest and the Midwest is stupid like that sometimes. Also I love watching your videos
Is that a wig
Omg yasssssss bish I LOVE THE LOOKBOOk 😍😍🥰💕
Omg can I plz have that sweater ilyssm Eva u r my fav youtuber
How does Eva look like a FREAKIN GODDESS in EVERYTHING? 😍
She has such a good style


Lol she croped everything
My mom and I call thrift stores t-h-rift lol I love GW
Watch her take some awesome
Instagram posts.
okay i feel like thrifting is no longer unique because almost every girl shops at goodwill at my school including me😂
Okay I was shook about how good that maxi floral dress looked as a matching set.
treasure hunt and cheap clothes what more would you waaant
GW THRIFT QUEENNN!
Eva, you should definitely  put a belt on when you wear the oversized sweater :)
my fav was the red h and m coat dress xx
I loved the cropped red dress❤️❤️
Kinda bothers me that she says “the goodwill” does anyone else only say goodwill?????
goes to goodwill in a porsche
I don’t know what it is about thrifting in LA that makes their clothes so cute. Thrift stores in Alabama are literal old people clothes😂
That red dress 😍😍😍
warning 





You will find the most satisfying video on my channel
girl so pretty and im here looking like a potato… i wish i was this goals
I love Eva so much!! I’ve used all here tips and tricks and she has inspired me to create my own channel which I have just came out with my 4th video! All her videos are amazing and I love how she uses her influence and I’m planning on creating similar content! I love you so much Eva and thanks for inspiring me!

Love you'r Natural hair
You didn’t have to hype up your Hawaii friends by bringing down the old ones that WERE there for you at one point in your life.
“when people try to play me and use me, i’m literally OUT” Yet you’re still friends with Brent who literally played with your feelings for YEARS and wouldn’t be honest about his feelings towards you?????
this should all be like a cliche movie. A city materialistic girl found herself in the island of Hawaii. Found lowkey people. There is Greg who works at a cafe. There is Joe who works at the surf shack. Tamalia and Lila are the best girls who are so spontaneous like me. I found myself in the island. This is who I am. Im gonna walk around almost naked bc i'm a beach girl now and i'm freeeeee. My bitchy LA friends were so shook. Jokes on them i'm the wokest. & they are all boring making hauls and same thing all the time. I'm so done w/ them. I want growth. The sea is calling me. Im free. SO CLICHE
i hope you saw meredith's reply comment on her instagram post (where she publicly came out about her eating disorder) where she finally confirmed that you guys outing her and dumping her for her disorder just made it way worse. if you had truly "researched it" as you said at the time you wouldn't have done the worst possible thing you could to to someone struggling. thats all, as someone who has struggled myself i had to say that. hope you better yourself and can be a better friend to others in the future. and from this point forward, please stop putting savage squad in your titles. 🖤
when you talk about the “old you” it makes it sound like the perfect happy saturated style you put off is in the past. It looks like the Instagram model life of posting pics in bikinis everyday and traveling to a new place every other week is even more unrealistic and “fake” than posting diy videos with a fake happy personality. What I’m trying to say is, you don’t seem anymore “woke” than you were before. It all still seems fake, especially only hanging out with people who travel and model with you. You’re trying to still be the relatable teen you were in 2014, sorry but acting like one of those “my life is perfect” Instagram models isn’t relatable. And that’s my opinion// commenting bc I haven’t seen anyone say this yet
Hold up, you slated Meredith publicly making her out to be an awful person, then you go and do the same thing? Noted.
soooo she made a whole 30 minute video about how brent was terrible to her and made her cry repeatedly but she chose to pursue a relationship with him and cut off teala?? make it make sense
Did you just compare your “journey” to Mulan ?? Honey, no......
Why isn’t Eva addressing her clothing line It’s All Wild? They did a post on instagram launching an international model casting and contacted the girls saying they’d send them a free product from the line and never did? Shortly afterwards they weren’t replying to any messages or emails and Eva’s just completely avoided talking about it!
I was one of the people they messaged and I was so excited and so was everyone else, just go on itsallwild instagram page and see the comments!! 
People also have giftcards which they can’t use now, peoples orders never arrived! What happened???
She needs to read more books to expand her vocabulary.
Wait...according to Teala, she reached out to u, u didn’t respond and this is the first she’s hearing of ANY of this in this video. That’s not growth. That’s ghosting someone you’ve been friends with for years. That’s selfish and inconsiderate to her feelings. If u didn’t wanna be friends anymore, u could have let her kno. Petty.
You handled the friendship situation very poorly and your narcissism and self gloat showed throughout this video. You're doing exactly what complained about Mere doing which you know wasn't right but still did it. Friends do not have to share the same interests. You're coming off as though you are better than them. Ghosting friends who have even tried to reach out to you? smh. Unsubscribed.
Honestly you're kind of a hypocrite. You threw shade at Meredith in the past for dropping you and Teala and Sierra without any explanation and now you're doing the exact same thing to them. Just because you don't have that much in common doesn't mean you have to literally ghost them and not talk to them anymore. Why can't you all stay friends regardless? I mean you obviously don't have to force it but they reached out to you multiple times and instead of talking in person you upload a video shading them which is the rudest and most immature thing to do especially considering the fact that you used to be so close that you'd literally spend every day together. I used to be a huge fan but this made me really lose respect for you. I'm definitely taking Tealas side on this.
Seriously? Complaining about your friends not going on the adventures when you want? So are your friends supposed to just drop everything and pause their lives to go do whatever you want?
Eva... you’re the problem. And the audacity to compare you dropping your loyal friends to mulan experience. Mulan made a sacrifice for the sake of her father. In the end, she came back to her family. Your decision was a self interest and narcissistic. You don’t drop friends with no explanation. I have friends that I haven’t talked to for years bc of time with school and work but we still talk from months to months. You just drop them.

Edit: make it sense to me. Sierra is in a damn relationship and her bf is a model so they can’t leave with you to travel for months just because. They have to make “coins “ girl. Teala is a damn ACTRESS. Like they can’t leave for months. I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t mind taking a vacay here and there but all the time???? Girl nooo
Okay, but he’s not Coco, he is Miguel and his grand grandma was Coco. Please.
Girl don compare urself to Mulan don’t even rn
You’re honestly shady as hell lmao. What’s done in the dark ALWAYS comes to light. You were in your feelings and hurt when Meredith ghosted you and you practically told the entire world that she suffered with an ED. Now when Teala expresses how you went MIA and haven’t been in contact with her and ghosts her until you make this video, you wanna claim it as “drifting apart.” I understand none of us will ever understand what truly went down in the friendship, but you’re messed up for being so immature and then wanting to gloat how you’re so “spirituality awakened and woke.” You need to grow up. Quickly
You change friends with seasons 😳😳
I feel like you're the toxic friend/person. Yes, people grow apart and gain different interests but you don't need to shade your old friends and basically belittle them because you feel you're better, more intellectual, more "woke" etc. You were shading them for so long when you were in Hawaii under the guise of being "philosophical". It was rude as hell.
Just gonna say
 it: Coco was the grandma
Girl...friendship is about diversity. They accept you for who you are, vice versa. Just bc they don't love traveling or want to be NG photographers doesn't mean you have to cut them off. As long as they support you and love you for who you are then that's what matters. You should be able to be yourself around them 😊
these comments are the only reason I'm deciding to watch this video.....TEAAAAAAA
Girl.... bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lmao Every time you think you've 'leveled up' you drop the people who were with you. The first time i noticed that is with your first little white boyfriend bk in the day. lol As soon as you started to get more attention you dropped it like a hot potato to date "hotter" white boys right? lmaoooo you do know that you can have different groups of friends right??? No need to ditch and diss the only group.
So you made Meredith out to be a horrible person for basically, according to you doing the same thing to your friend group. That's rich 🙄
I don't think it was smart to burn bridges with friends who had your back. Good, loyal friends can be hard to find
I can guarantee that in about 5 to 10 years you will be in a different and more mature space in your life and realize how poorly you handled your "transition" to your new life. When you don't have the same interests or goals with your friends it is OK to see less of them but it is never OK to just chuck them out of your life if they haven't wronged you. They loved you.
Honestly... No one is asking for you to give up your goals and dreams for friendships... but If you are wiling to cut off your closest friends because you feel like they are holding you back or not on your level.. thats selfish. Im sure Teala and Seirra want to see you succeed and reach your goals and dreams too.. They would be happy for you and want the best for you.. Just because they don't have the same dreams and goals as you doesn't mean they are toxic. the three of you where like sisters. Eva you honestly don't know what you have until its gone.. & I think you made a big mistake.
Wow. I’m disappointed. I thought you were the mature one but that’s clearly not the case. Smh 😔
Lets be grown and not shade. If Teala really did reach out and you ignored her that's childish. If you don't wanna be her friend that's cool but be mature about it. Let her know.  Don't ghost years worth of a friendship then shade her and all your other LA friends like your in high school. There was a better way to address the situation.
“My PrOgReSsiON In mY SPiRiTuaLiTy”
Sometimes friends have different interests, that DOES NOT give you the right to ghost them for months and then publicly trash them. You’re such an inconsiderate person and show so many toxic traits, get some help love!!
You are the same as any other Instagram model, travelling, taking pictures of your half naked selfs for what... now thinking she is a destined world traveler.
So she’s saying your friends HAVE to like the same things as you or else they aren’t true genuine friends???? Ya ummm it ain’t that.. wtf
Just because Teala and Sierra don't have the same interests as you, doesn't mean you should reject them as friends
💀wow this made not even want to watch her anymore...✌🏽
I guess you never really know someone, I thought you were the more sensible one out of the group but I guess I was wrong. You sound like a narcissist and to uppity now, You act like you are better than your friends. I am definitely not a subscribed watcher anymore, you gave Mere hell for what she did now you are ditching and dodging because you think you’re on some new high level vibration that Teala and Sierra is not on. You will get your Karma you surly will, remember that.
Do she even have black friends anymore???
It just sounds like you feel like because your presence has grown on YouTube and have gotten bigger, you want to surround yourself with youtubers on your level (aka Brent)
Narcissist is what came too mind after sitting and listening to this!! Those girls are better off .we got to stop attaching " self Growth" to bitterness
I feel like some of the things that she’s saying just prove what I’ve always thought — she comes off as funny but she’s rlly just mean and petty
I’m just gonna unsubscribe and continue to support Teala, Sierra, and Meredith. I’ve been supporting and subscribed to Eva since 2013-2014 but she’s really full of herself and FAKE. I’m over it. And her content is boring 🙄
You sound so full of yourself in this video. You are no better than anyone else honey!
She tries to make this video as if she's the postive one but she's really the toxic friend.
Lmaoooo girl you can have friends that enjoy stuff differently...you sound weird I’m pretty sure they would’ve understand
That ain’t it chief 👎
uhhhh.... ok

But they never asked you to be NOT you. Just because they don’t want to do the same things, doesn’t mean that they wouldn’t support your goals.

Wow....
I really relate to this a lot. As i grow, i realize i cant be with people that arent being genuine friends and pretend that its okay.
All I wanted to know if your dating Brent
And here I thought Teala was childish... well my apologies goes to Teala! Cause after seeing this video my viewpoint has indeed changed! As most of the comments mention; the video shows no “growth” at all. Eva can lie to herself but not others.
there are so many people commenting on how Eva cut out her old "toxic" friends, and how she's really the one that's toxic. and I do understand where everyone is coming from, but at the same time I know how stimulating it can be to have people with the same values, interests and goals in life. and if other people are holding you back from accomplishing your goals, or living the lifestyle that you want, I think it's okay to cut them off. obviously we don't know if her old friends really did hold her back, but if she felt that way and she feels good now, she probably made the right decision for herself.
This is random but I love the Spotify playlists that u made could u make one with all the songs that u use in your videos?
the fact that I was subscribed to you for years but you decided to pull stunts like this............electric chair
When Eva tries to be Goofy at the beginning and making those faces its very cringy
I'm sorry but the explanation you gave dont show growth at all. It was full of shade, talking about how YOUR growth was block because of them, how they make  you regress, just how you were TOO GOOD for them. JUST NO.  I do understand you can grow apart from people, but tell me if i'm wrong  it feels like you basically cut them off out of nowhere. As arsh as it is .. This is what you did. They didn't do anything to you and you woke up one day and just stopped talking to them what so ever. Life is not only about achieving your biggest goal. God give you people YES to support you but also to be there for you when simple things happens. Maybe their goal wasn't the same as yours and I wish yours will happens but one day you will come back home and realize your mistake.Which was to ERASE people who would be there for you no matter what I'M SURE.
Eva ily but why’d you shade your old friends like that ... on the internet... without telling them Teala even said she wasn’t aware of any of this ... 💥 you may have different goals than your friends but that doesn’t mean they’re toxic ... they may have hung out with you and filmed or took pictures but you guys are influencers isn’t that what you are supposed to do ? And u posted the pictures and the collabs as well so like i dont really know i mean i dont know the whole situation but like this seems kind of sudden and childish 😕
You just lost a subscriber. ✌
The cinematography of your videos is so inspiring. I am actually going to Hawaii in a few months and am so excited to film
You should watch Monica Church. Her editing skills are amazing
I don't think the "squad" was actually ever REAL friends, I feel like they only hung out because of Youtube but I don't think you should act like you didn't have fun times. You guys did look like you had a lot of fun and was close to a certain point but you just wanted something different.

BUT

I hate the way you and the squad deals with this stuff especially with the shade. Teala said in her video, "Well I haven't seen Eva since October so..." Like shit, talk to each other, why allow this to happen then shade each other online. 

That's not what real friends do. If you felt that way you should have told them. Not disappear from them then shade them months later ON YOUTUBE!

And judging by Teala's video you didn't cut them off Eva, you just stopped talking to them. You should have been honest with them because I'm sure you would never allowed that to happen with your Hawaii friends. Take a look in the mirror and notice you can also be just as toxic.
I understand that people can be toxic but, don’t try and put your situations all on them. you chose to stay with “the savage squad” for as long as you did. you chose to be around fake people (even though you can "see right through them").

your friends can’t control who you are or what you do. their not inside your head, their not inside your body, nor can they control your emotions. you choose the friends you have and who you hang out with.
And now she only hangs out with Brent, Ben, Caleb, and the Stokes Twins.  I guess Brent took her side of the argument.
i saw eva at the airport in calgary canada 🇨🇦 i was too scared to say hi tho
This video is honestly so shady I can't even make it through. Just "grow apart" peacefully without belittling people who used to be important to you and basically calling them shallow throughout the whole video. There's a reason you were friends, so all this shade you're throwing at the qualities in them you don't like, you possessed as well. Wow, girl.
What I got from this video: I’m better than everyone else and so are my Hawaii friends.
Ever since she’s been hanging out in Hawaii she’s had this vibe about her that she’s better than everyone and super fake. We can all see it Eva. You’re the fakest of them all. Not your LA friends. Maybe all those car accidents you’ve been in is karma 🤷🏽‍♀️
You out Meredith after she ghosts you and you ghost your former best friends🙇🏿‍♂️All that was ever required as the courteous thing to do was let them know why you’re gonna dip. Period. 

The fact that you’re gonna be this hypocritical about this situation bro, I want you to go to that  boy of yours who dogged you to YouTube a few months ago and really question what you value in friendship.
i literally get you eva like sometimes i wish i could me my own videographer but still be in my videos xx
I would definitely do it with you, but I'm only 13 so😂🤣 (exploring and travel, I love doing that type of stuff to)
Girl, I love you but like seriously?! You just realized that you were “bored” of Teala and Sierra? And you waited for the New Year to dump them and dip out? I’m pretty sure that they genuinely love you and if you had acted your “real” self, they would have still loved you and motivated you to do you. All you had to do was like sit them down and have a conversation between you all. It’s healthy to have friendships with people whom have different interests. You’re free to be you and try what you want, but deciding to not talk to a close friend suddenly is not cool (if you’re tryna be real- work on your communication skills).
GET 👏🏾 BOX 👏🏾 BRAIDS 👏🏾
adopt me pls

literally if i were out of school i would work with u in a heartbeat, we have so much in common <3
You WAS single😉
Your happiness just brightens my day 🥰
are u kidding me? if one of my friend offered me to go on a trip, I would say yes in a heartbeat!
at first, I thought her shirt said, Kevin Keller... I'm disappointed.
Everyone is talking about Sierra and Teala,but Eva said so much other important things in the video! Why you guys just want drama? 🙄
Within the first seconds of this video my first thought was: why do people watch her 😂😂 ✌🏼✌🏼
Hey Eva I have natural hair I'm 9 so I can't wear wigs but my mum  either puts my hair two cornrows ,puffs and box braids 😊
She sounds like the eat pray love chick who dumped her husband without any reason and traveled and called it "growth"


Traveling more doesn't mean you're better than other people it just means you have more money and free time
I agree- sometimes friendships just grow apart

I can also not say no to people which is something I am trying to work on because so many people have taken advantage of me
I WOULD LOVE TO DO CINEMATOGRAPHY
She really needs to watch Sorelle Amore's videos, she makes the best travel videos
Eva I love your videos , I’ve been an evanator since the beginning and you taught me nothing but self confidence and being my self 💁🏻‍♀️ you’re a true inspiration and I’m 19 now it’s been a long journey 😎🤙🏼
Who else wants to go on a road trip with Eva? Her travel vlogs are so amazing!
What about Alisha Marie?! What happened to her and you doing collaborations together I could not take it when you said that you were not friends with Teala. It was heartbreaking! I remember when you did a video with Teala about weird kids toys, I loved that!
look at indy blue she does all of the travel vlogs
U should do a career video !! If that makes sense
Wow... I lowkey feel like Eva and I would be bffs lol. I try to make it a goal to visit a new place each year and when I go I make a video of all of the experiences there to have like a "virtual" memory of the trip. It's a step up from a picture lol. Idk I'm not amazing at it but I do always feel accomplished after making them. You're amazing girl keep doing you :p
It's kinda sad that you just cut off your old friends just because you got new ones
Where was she talking about meredith cos I can't find it...
I wanna help you on your project!!!!! <3
No offense but you can be friends with anyone. Your friends don’t have to like the same thing you do. You don’t have to talk to your friends 24/7 but when you meet up the love and stuff is still there. I go to college and made a lot of new friends but as for my friends back home don’t go to college, work, and stay home and haven’t done much. Of course I still talk to them and meet up when we can, just because we aren’t doing the same thing doesn’t mean I’ll drop them or think less of them...but okay
you look so happy!!!
Correct me if I'm wrong. So...is she saying that she is better and more woke, therefore she has the right to deliver the news of her ditching Teala and Sierra in YouTube without talking to them first ? ? ?

What kind of love did the squad share? When she can't even at least respect their friendship.
Did her subscribers drop
I don’t even care what people are saying about you and the savage or whatever. Your literally the most inspirational person on YouTube right now and I look up to you so much omg💗you literally mean so much to me and your Hawaii this is living video has got me through so much it just motivates me to work hard and do something with my life like you have! So thank you for constantly inspiring me and many others❤️❤️
Ladies....this is the example of a "girl"...cuz she isn't a woman yet, that you don't want to follow. Don't chase a man until he agrees to SOMEWHAT date you. Don't be desperate like this....you r awesome and don't need a man to make you better....rise up powerful women and be independent and KNOW YOUR WORTH.
Omg I couldn’t help but think abt my ex besties while watching this 😭
I don’t like how she shaded teala & sierra just bc they don’t have the same interest as her.Shes mad bc they don’t wanna travel as much as her maybe that’s not for them.
Your getting all this hate about you not being friends with teala and Sierra but I feel you I once went through this and I'm happy for u ❤️
In other words you and Brent are NOT a thing. It appears as if you are forcing them.
Eva look up 

Laura Reid.

Love you xx
becoming a cinematic videographer/ photographer is my absolute dream career and you are so inspirational to me, I hope to travel the world and to be able to make and capture amazing memories like you do one day.
This is pure bs & karma is real 🤷🏾‍♀️.
I have no experience but I would absolutely love to be your assistant and learn from you lol. Let’s show the boys who’s in charge
CAN I ADD A SIDENOTE: your hair is super pretty ❣️
You cab have different friends for different things !! ... u day u don’t want ur friends to like “use” u for like social media posts but then u want videographer friends to film you ? ... im just saying.
I would absolutely travel with you! How could people not want to do spontaneous adventures I love that stuff! Also teach me your photography, filming, editing ways! 😍 your vlogs are incredible!  
Subscribed and following you everywhere, every time you upload it’s a high light of my day! ❤️
I’ve made so many positive comments on videos of yours Eva but this one was not it. You cannot ghost your friends without giving them an explanation and then months later decide to give us a full exposé on what happened to your friendship. This is completely disrespectful and rude. They are human too and have feelings just like you and all the feelings you describe in this video. I’m very disappointed in you because you come across as straight up pretentious and “holier than thou” in this video as if you’re somewhat better them because of your interests.
Again she says friends and BRENT is in another categatory
i feel as though all these hate comments aren't getting people anywhere. everyone calm downn
The most inspiring things what I sound before
20:04 you’re welcome🙂
~*~i'M nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs~*~
She didn’t shade them. Alot of you are just young.

I WANT TO DO THE TRAVEL THING WITH YOU EVAA
17:22 I would love to, Iam really I retested but the problem is I am only 14 years old so it would be pretty hard for me..... 😢
Wow...that’s all I have to say...🤦🏾‍♂️
girl
Michelle Phan does cinematic shizz
Who’s scrolling through the comments while watching the video? 🤩
you just helped me name a feeling i felt for the past 4 months, thank you so much! now let me work on that 
do you, go girl!!!
OMG IM A LEO TOO ♌️
Hi! Travel, lifestyle and food videography vlogger here.🙆‍♀️🌹

P.S. please do a tutorial with travel editting videos. 🌺
just wishing you had a podcast cause you have the BEST speaking voice! You’re so inspiring! Keep it up!! 💓
I guess you’re grown, better and more woke than everyone now that you have “friends” in Hawaii.... 😴
U should do a collaboration
 with Rclbeauty 101
I wish I could be your friend and help you with filming and go on super spontaneous road trips with you‼️😂 You are so inspiring and we are both passionate about the same thing💙💙
I love u(have the best 2019)
I agree with you!
I’m gonna try and say this in a nice way. But Eva sounds really selfish. What she is basically saying is that her friends didn’t share her interests. But that’s not what friendships are about. It’s not about what your friends can do for you but about finding people you can trust and who loves you. And throwing that away and stop talking to your friends because they’re not into cinematography and blue ass water is ridiculous. You’re gonna end up really lonely Eva because that’s not how to be a friend.
She ghosted them so she could have free time to chase after a man who doesn't want her....look at the video where he was styling her hair...he looked uncomfortable and I could have sworn he said "eww" when he touched her hair once (correct me if I'm wrong)....honestly Eva you r pathetic....done watching ur bs content...U have shamed me as a fellow mixed black lady...👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Your cinematic content is so amazing! You really inspire me to keep making my own travel videos and keep evolving and practicing with editing! ❤️🌸
Love you Eva ❤️❤️ am thinking about being a YouTuber and you have expire me to do so btw new subscriber 💕💕💕 you are so happy and I want to join you in your journey
I just started my channel, and your speech about the whole journey and cinematography thing really inspired me!! I'm looking forward to seeing more from you so I can learn 😍 I wish I could be your videographer, rip :') That would literally be the dream 😭
I see right through Eva she’s coming off as really pretentious and holier than thou lately Teala is not my favorite person but the way she did Teala and sierra is really dirty but Teala has been there for Eva through thick and thin and watching Tealas video and seeing that Eva just dropped her with no explanation and uploaded this video making everything seem fine and dandy without even contacting her first to let her know how she feels is wrong and shady, not saying you can’t drop old friends but do it in a better way than that, Eva has been shading Teala and sierra for months in her vids and on twitter saying she has no friends that care for her or have her interests (news flash!! You can have friends that have different interests !!) just cause Teala and Siera don’t wanna ride her coat tails and kiss her ass like that’s really messed up and Eva knows it , she’s always talking about dropping ppl but I think she needs to take a hard look in the mirror and realize she’s the toxic friend perhaps
Sorelle Amore is a girl that's already killing it in the travel / cinematography scene
Are child vs teen/adult coming back because I literally missed them sooooooo much please say they are coming back
I'm a Leo too👑
#Leogang
Mai Phammy does tons of travel and is proabably one of my fav YouTubers you should definitelytalk to her :)
7:45 "I WAS SINGLE" So your not single anymore😉😂#breva
Wow id love to meet you you just speak out of my soul..❤
Haha ummm loving the beginning😂
I know I'm late, but this video was really eye opening. I wait too long to cut people off when they no longer in alignment with my path. It's so hard to do, but it's how we grow. I'm just now beginning to realize that being alone is okay.
Girl I have always loved you but haven't watched your vids as much lately but just.. so much respect. Do you!
You know it’s gonna be TEA TEA, when savage squad is mentioned in the title 😳
That you and brent is dating😍??
Eva!! I wanted to watch your morning routine(/amazing advice) again but it aint there anymore😔 what happened?! I love that video and you are so inspirational❤️
I’m so excited for 2019 content! Literally wish I knew anything about cinematography or how to edit videos😂 because I would love to travel and create content with you ! 💙
MEEEEE holy crap im only 15 but im obsessed with cinematic videos and i want to do the kind of videos that you do when im older, like i wanna travel the world and make all the cinematic videos to show and keep as a memory how amazing the places were. It's my literal dream. Much love for you Eva.
ugh those hawaii vlogs were my favorite part of 2018 too :))))
evaaaaa i want the same things with the traveling and making videos with my friends!!!!!!! im about to graduate college so let me finish that up real quick and then hmu pls
I know this comment is a little late but... I just wanted to say, Eva you inspire me so so so very much! You are literally my freaking favourite YouTuber!!😘😘
I don't know what to say and I don't have much to say too because I am so disappointed with you. Never thought that I would do this but I'm  done.
You really need to grow up. why shade Teala and Sierra? "Spilling some Tea" as everyone says now is so childish,especially when you were hurt by someone doing this to you in the past?! I don't get it,please just talk to people you have "problems" with in person and not just post a video online and expect everything to be okay
There are people who like to twist the context of what one says because this is 2019 with the internet but I would like to tell you that coming from someone who is not an influencer of any kind that you are very inspiring and that I understand where you come from when you talk about growth within ones self. I'm five months late on this comment section but this video is probably one of my favorites form you.
That sounds great, keep it up eva!! I would love to do photography with u that was always my dream😘
You should do some long triangle part box braids !
I love you for this❤️ Raw Eva✨
I’ll be your videographer! For real! My dream is to work one to one with a social influencer, creating high quality cinematic edits and travelling the world! Being a girl has always put people off using my business and I’m so keen for that to change as it’s something I’m so passionate about. I’m really seriously interested so please message me if this is something I can do! I’d be so grateful to anyone who can like this comment as I would love for Eva to see this- thanks! :) x
Try rice water to grow your hair and hot oil treatments
Girllll i have been interested in cinematography and videography for so long!! If you ever wanna kidnap me to travel somewhere I’ll go happily💞
I freaking love your 2019 goal!!! You are my Inspiration for Videography and Photography, just starting out and hoping to one day just be half as good as you❤️❤️
Oh my Lord, to be Eva's videographer.... 😍 that's a dream job for sure.
I’m sort of starting to see the side to Teala and especially Sierra that I have a feeling is the side Eva is trying to grow away from. It has become really apparent that social media is a huge catalyst to how insecure Sierra is, she talks so negatively about herself constantly, I feel like she just radiates a deep insecurity only time will heal and for that, she’s probably just toxic to Eva now without even realising it. I don’t mean any hate at all because I actually love Sierra and have been subscribed to her for years, but if I’m being purely honest I would understand how it would be hard for Eva to be around her these days. Teala I just don’t understand at all tbh, I just see, for lack of a better word, a facade. That’s okay, they’ll experience their journey and soul searching on their own terms, but when you grow at different rates this shit happens. I hope they all eventually find themselves and their happiness soon 💗
true friends don't grow apart
Btw ive literally been watching your vids from like the beginning and i'm loving your new style!!!
Lol wait girl hello hi! I’m a lonely travel vlogger here. I can only ask my mom to film my outfits so many times haha 😂
His name is Miguel! Not coco! Jajaj
Why doesn’t Eva live in Hawaii full time and just visit LA from time to time?
You’ve always been quite creative towards cinematography and I love your style on them!  I can’t wait to see your creations 😍
She said she WAS Single. Hello ? Brent , you there? 😅😅😅😆😆😆
i really admire you for all the effort you put in the videos and the way you handle all the pressure on social media is so cool & no kidding i’d love to be your travel buddy 
you are amazing
I have been around your channel a long time ago and I love your new content, keep being yourself ❤️❤️
I obviously don’t know your entire situation with you, Sierra, and Teala! but it’s not fair the way you treated them. you guys all opened up and addressed that you didn’t like the way Meredith ended her friendship with you guys. So doing the same thing is just immature. whether Teala reached out or not (which I believe Teala because she seemed broken in her vlog video)tell her if you don’t want to be her friend not ignore her. as well as Sierra.
EVA IS IT THE HIGH SCHOOL SERIES?!?!
so happy that you‘ve grown so much and i feel like you really know yourself now. I am a LEO too so hands up for independence💪🏻 you’re doing great eva don‘t let anyone tell you differently!
I'm a ♌ Leo too!
You should check out Yvonne Pferrer on YouTube she’s amazing😍🙏🏼
Sooo.. now u understand Meredith I guess......
I have to say it, I've been following u and all the "savage squad" for yeara now, and I liked it, I saw your pictures with them and I wished for me to have a group of friends like that, but not anymore cuz is a bunch of mean girls... I mean, now u come here and say those this like u want people whose bring positivity in your life after what you did to Meredith? If you are a true friend, you will never throw them under the bus, and even worse about a health problem that not even she share on social media, u took her rights to say that she was struggling with something even before she noticed it. Teala and Sierra did kind of the same, but I think about them just like two dumb, empty and idiots girls whose are hungry for views on YouTube with those "adressing the situation" videos, but you, exposed Meredith and that's not nice, now you just kick out of your life the other two just because they don't want to do what you want, or they don't have the same interest that you have..... after seeing this video I will definitely unfollow you (I already did unfollow Sierra and Teala as well) and I leave your channel really disappointed and realizing that actually the really mean girl here is you, and actually Meredith (and even the other two wannabes) are actually lucky that you slept out of their lives.
This video is the most fake, hypocrite and empty that I've seen from you.
we want the real Eva voiceover. We don't need the "happy" voice. You're amazing!!
Loved this video sooooo much!!! So genuine and really inspired me to live in the moment and not obsess over other people's expectations of you.
eva you are literally such an inspiration to me!! 😭💛❤️
Let’s be real, you pulled the same stunt that Meredith did when you just randomly decide to ghost your friends and shut them out and expect them not to have questions and wonder what the hell happened. Then you have the nerve to call it “growth” and “seasons” when in reality it sounds like you got bored and dropped them for the New Year. How about you try being an adult and sit and have a conservation with the people who I’m sure had your back  during difficult times. It’s not okay to make a video about why you “cut people off” when you couldn’t be bothered to have this conservation with those very people. You turned into quite the hypocrite and looks like you and Mere had more in common than you realized. Btw- it’s  healthy to have diversity in friendships. And karma is VERY real💋
This is awesome
friends that work for one season may not work for a different season. Because people are objects...to use and discard when they dont work. What a sad definition of friendship.
I love you Eva been a fan from the start! Keep doing you and continue being the most radiant human being you have become! Much love xox
Hey! I really want to learn how to edit likeur color balance and stuff. It's SOOO COOOLLLLL
im not just saying this for the sake of it this is actually my goal for the year.
I hope you read this haha <3
Shnicel sqoad

Love you eva
maybe Monica church
Totallyyyy merch❤️❤️maybe not but yes pls
12:13 gurll takee mee ill come with you anytime 
Hmu
Girl move to hawaii,cause you literally look like you feel your best there and if you can, please do, cause i loved those vlogs.
Eva, you should check out Erica Fae (Youtube) or Fae101 on instagram! She's my lovely friend who is amazing at cinematography!! She's very underrated and talented.
I think she is a project zorgo member
Meeeeeeeee ! I wanna help you out with your videos of show the boys that girl can do anything they can
hell yessss i would love to travel the world with u😻🤙🏻 i'm actually planning to get a camera and stuff to get into this whole travel photography thing😻😻
Ugh, I DO REALLY LUV SINCE 2012!! Please do visit Philippines 🇵🇭 !!!
Wooooow... she's so full of herself, I'm a bit shocked. :|
You and Brent  are dating. I'm 10000% sure 😂
i love monica church’s videos for cinematography
I don’t think Sierra and teala are bad people at all but I do think they are a product of YouTube and social media controlling their personalities and making them a little on the shallow side and this isn’t an insult but more of an observation but Eva deserves ppl that connect with her spirituality bc I think she has a lot of depth to her and just many sides to this cute lil YouTuber lol
Another music video like literally my life
Eva i just love your videos now❤️🥴
Lol i actually see this coming. Your "squad" is so pretentious looking for me
ive never related to someone more in my life wow
breaking gender stereotypes AND cutting off the fakes?? we love a strong queen
Shout out to Donte Colley for your intro lol love you Eva
what times is when she speaks about the savage squad?
God bless you girl ❤️ God will lead always a good year, just got to follow ❤️
Please do a part 2😘😘
"I was single" 7:47 breva fans have left the chat..
Eva: I feel like going to Hawaii in November was very therapeutic
Me : I had surgery in November
I have been watching you since I was 15 years old (I am now 21). I am so proud of you and inspired by your journey. I am currently going through the same season. It is painful and difficult to let go of friends/ grow apart from them. You are so brave for confessing this and taking action without dissing or disrespecting them. Thank you for this video! I am encouraged and inspired.
EVA SHOULD WESR BOX BRAIDS OMG I WANT TO SEE THAT❤️❤️
Aspyn Ovard makes amazing cinematic content!
To the 1% of people who see this



Hope you have a amazing day and you are beautiful!
I actually really love cinematology, I want to start it! Coming from an art and design background I've always had the eye for it. I tots feel you!
Honestly, Eva isn't my cup of tea. I used to love her and love how REAL and down-to-earth she was. But now she has a boob job and is being a complete hypocrite. When you get on a soap box about how an old friend of yours ghosted you, and then YOU do the SAME to your friends, you show no growth at all. You just think you've grown when, in reality, you haven't given a single example of how you've done that. If anything, you've shown that you can do exactly the thing you hate because YOU'RE doing it, so it's okay. And honestly, hiking Mount Everest is a stupid goal. Seriously, it's actually logically stupid. You're dropping friends because you want to pursue goals that can actually get you killed? To me it sounds like you're in a really rough part of your life and starting to make HUGE changes because you don't know how to cope. So you're painting it pretty like "striving for goals' and 'chasing spirituality' to probably cover up the fact that you're probably burnt out and not handling it well. I was never a fan of Teala, but she's shown a hell of a lot more growth and maturity in this one year than you have in 3 years. Sorry hun, I used to love you. But I can't support a hypocrite. Unsubscribing and best of luck finding whatever it is you're searching for. Also, saying that the guys only want to work with you to date you or make you their muse is not just pompous, but sexist. You just painted all males within that craft with the same brush. God, I just wish you could hear yourself. You seriously have convinced yourself that this is all great and wonderful, but you don't see how shallow you ACTUALLY are. You talk about making cool videos that aren't beauty, but the examples you show is of you posing pretty for the video. It's just funny and pathetic, honestly. You say these guys are your friends after you say that they smell and don't shower. You're a great friend. Well, Eva, it looks like you're digging your own grave. Have fun.
6:30 the tea you wanted to sip. Thank me later ;-)
Ya actually me and my friend are starting a YouTube channel and a vlog channel it would be cool if u filmed a video of tips and tricks for new coming YouTubers and btw ilysm u are one of my favorite YouTubers
I just want to point out that you said you don’t like fake friendships that are for filming sake and want to have real friendships and then in the next part of the video said you want cool cinematographer friends who you can be friends with to make videos with ... isn’t that the same thing?
i literally love u so much its insane. thank u for inspiring me
Love cinematography and want to make photography and cinematography my full time job one day ❤️
What do you use to edit videos? Btw they are amazing!😁🎀
omg I resonated so much with that friends not wanting to go on adventures :( also this actually really inspired me so thank you v much :) luv you <3
7:46 she says “I WAS single” I bet the thing she can’t tell us yet (projects) is about her and Brent BREVA FOR LIFE
There are a lot of girls at my high school so I think if they knew more about what you do they would be very interested
This video is so inspiring! You're such a wonderful person and I love that youre looking to grow continuously! 
I'm also always that friend that plans trips and none of my friends end up joining me, so a while ago I decided I'd go by myself and it's honestly so clearing for the mind. I would defiantly recommend it!!
You should get braids .... box braids or poetic justice braids 😊
You should ask Erika costil
“IVE GROWN” loooooool
Hi eva you are my favorite youtuber since a long time and since i was little i wanted to travel and exsplore but im to "little" so i guess i have to wait
ps.I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Eva you still need a girl to go on trips with you? Cause I can pack rn! I need to find an internship for this summer! Love ya!!! <3 Stay true to yourself like always beautiful
sis where did you get your shirt?! I've been looking for a sheer shirt like that for sooooo long!!!! 😍😍
Hey eva, I think you are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING you are a QUEEN in EVERY WAY and I know that your future will be so beautiful and amazing. Follow your dreams, and love life😂. P.S you and Brent are my favorite youtubers
You’re unbelievably stunning with your natural curly hair I can’t😭
Omg I want to do that!!! I want to travel and video it!! Can we be friends?!? I love your vibess💕❤️
I'm in love with you 😍
Eva I am so proud of u for making this big change in your life for the better.U are inspiring me hardcore cause my name is also Ava so I feel like u are speaking at me through the screen telling me to make a change in my life.The entire vibe of your videos are so posotive and if I had to choose a youtuber to ask for advice or help with something I think u would be a really good pick.I Love U SO Much Gurl <3

Love,
Ava (aka Evanator forever) <3
U and Brent r dating aren’t u?
I know honey makes ur hair grow longer, healthier, and faster.
All respect for you is lost. You “exposed” Mere publicly in a way that was almost disgusting, and she never said anything about any of you guys, but yet here you are doing that; ditching your close friends with no explanation. Expect you shade Teala and Sierra and act very immature. I honestly feel bad for Teala and she isn’t exactly my favorite, but y’all were close, and no matter what she didn’t deserve this. It’s just not right and you definitely are not a real friend. Disappointed.

Also literally all the comments are about this so what’s your excuse?
you should wear box braids, they would look go on you
Are u and Brent together because u seem so happy. You are so inspirational ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved this video! You are such an inspiration! Laura Reid makes very cool cinematic travel videos as well😊
Please get box braids! Just make sure you moisturize your scalp with a leave in conditioner of some sort
Eva how do you make your iced-coffee?
yes that's how i'm... want to get out be adventurous 🌻⚡️ !! i'll get there at some point 😊
Oooo Eva should get box braids
Honestly your recent content have been some of the best you've been making, and you seem happier too!
I untested she doesn't want to hang out with shallow people trust me I get that but do it gracefully do it privately if that makes sense. I remember when she "exposed" Meredith for cutting "the savage squad" off and now she did the same the difference is that Mere never shaded or talked about them. Also if there's no tea and you wanna grow and be mature why didn't wish a happy birthday to Teala and around the same time she wished a happy birthday to other friend and I know that sound dumb but for them it's really important to wishh a happy birthday publicly so that to me shows they didn't end up in good terms
awww u love the smith brothers <3
Girl I feel u so hard with the cinema world being dominated by men....I hope to change this too one day and im rooting 4 u ❤❤❤
ah love u! I’ve been an o.g since the diys😂 anyway I’m obsessed ur asthestic so much! would literally loveee to be best friends with u!!💗💗
Yes girl live your best life
this explanation.... girl, you messed up. That u r too good for anyone, your friends blocked u? haha...
Hee, stopped watching you for a while but im back and loving it lately! And omg so relatable with the mental priorities (also got a list of spiritual goals for this year) and friends not wanting to go on adventures. I want to go to France in a car with a map, nothing else and just enjoy life and the adventure of it all. I need to find what you’ve found in Hawaii. You are killing it! Wish you the best with all you’ve life plans and video content ♥️💗
I think you should check out Laura Reid! Se has many cinematic content, and she travels a lot to
Honestly, when a friend ghost you it is the worst feeling ever, you feel insecure and worthless.
you should totally team up with @plantifulsoul on ig ans yt!! shes also really good at cinematography!!!
Friendships grow apart, come back together, grow apart again all the time :) You go through life in waves, eventually making it back to shore
You should definitely show us how you make it. Please. I love you Ava soooo much I have watched you for so long 😫😫
To be honest, your vlogs make me wanna become a youtuber as well but I'm too scared. But your vlogs are amazing I hope I can become like you someday 🙄❤️
So much of what you're saying about friendship hits Home , I feel like i'm in this long transition towards more genuine friendships and a lifestyle that better reflects who I am . Thanks for being you and making Amazing and Sunny content ❤️😊
You should check out Monica Church, she did a lot of vlogs and they're pretty dang good!
Spill👏🏽the👏🏽tea👏🏽on👏🏽breva👏🏽
Hi, Eva...You are my favorite Youtuber.You really insipre me...by the way I looove cinematic videos.I have a good mood, when I watch your instagram cinematic videos.Just remember, you are the best!😊
7:46 
Was single?
Eva, don't you mean Miguel from Coco. Coco was the great grandmother...
I also make cinematic videos 🤙🙋🏽‍♀️
That’s kinda messed up you drop them, and if you still have love for them why didn’t you wish Teala a happy birthday?
IS BREVA BEING REVEALED?!?!?!?!?😱😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Indy blue!!!
im so excited for you to dive deeper into cinematography! ive been wanting to begin cinematography but have been so weary to.  you are such an inspiration! love you eva!
You never expose people like that
Girl, Aspyn Ovard has been in the cinematography game for YEARS
min 1:33 is so relateable
Oh Eva, I wished I had your problems😄
Love u smm
Eva do not listen to the haters below with their chunky “all knowledge” paragraphs you be you and live your life
I am a professional.
Okay girl so... from all of the pictures I’ve seen of you’ve never had box braids and that’s a very protective style so maybe give that hairstyle a try?
i would  love  to travel the world with you Eva but i'm literally 12 /:
I love this so much bc she just said everything I want to do but I am afraid to get judged
she stays using the savage squad in her titles so that she gets views... sad.
I also have friends who aren't as adventurous as me and it always holds me back cuz I want to go on adventures and stuff live you Eva xxx ❤️
She’s actually the only YouTuber I’ve bought a book from, it was just so good
Cinematography Is the kind of content I want on my channel as well , I’m in school for mass comm (graduate in may)  so I know how to do literally everything I need to ,but I feel stuck sometimes and lately unmotivated with this mainstream content ppl put out and trying to keep up with this and I’m over it...
im trying to start a youtube channel and any tips on how to make it myself??? btw love u eva<3
She says “I was single” #Breva 7:44
I love that you discovered what was best for you and that your doing what makes you happy! Letting go of people that just bring you down is so important, even if they aren't intentionally doing it, you have to do what makes you feel free. I understand! 
P.s. - I love that your doing cinematic filming, I want to do the same but only know the bare basics and my minds vision- but who knows in the future :), you have definitely inspired me!
I am living for everything you said and I wanna take over the boys
JUST MOVE TO HAWAII ALREADY
I love filming cinematic videos and I love editing and posting them (on Insta) but I'm too young to travel with you since I'm still in school😭
Are you and Brent dating yet?? Please I ship y’all so much, but even if you aren’t I still love you❤️❤️❤️
you should get box braids or twist
I honestly don’t mind being your travel buddy!!! 😫😂💃🏽💖✨✨
phew i knew u were a leo before you even said it by that whole explanation smh
that intro hurt to watch
you're awesome!
Call me up girl! Its my dream to travel, and that would be so cool to learn new photography skills. I took multimedia in high school and learned a lot about filming!
Can you do a spiritual routine on how you find peace in your life.
I have been wondering forever is her and Adam still together
I think that you are going to become sumone that will change the worlds perspective of nature and true friendships and everything happens for a reason!!
I get what you went through you know pretending to like something or be someone they expected me to be just for the sake of friendship. Sometime last year I realized what I had been doing I wasn't being my self I would convince myself that I just wanted to make them feel comfortable . but I knew it was wrong I had to start living upto my expectations not others 

Thank you so much for sharing this with me I thought I was the only one . Love you
Ok but where is Paris?!? Is she ok
That’s probably exactly how Meredith felt....
Look up Meg Showell, she’s in Hawaii and does dope content!
Hit me up if you’re ever in New Zealand. I do photography and am slowly getting into videography :)
I love what you said in this video because I think it is so true that you change and sometimes you need to make changes and the old friends you have my not change in that way! I totally related to this! So thank you for being brave enough to share! Love that you are showing me and girls to just be ourselves! So much truth! Love you beautiful❤️
GIRL LUV YA AND HANALEI BUT WERE IS YOUR CAT PARIS.
i DIED when eva said she wanted to become a national geographic photographer because that’s LITERALLY what i want to do in life AHHH EVA I HOPE U BECOME ONEEEE
I love your videos  so much and I hope that you accomplish your goals love you ❤️
2:51 I bet its a season 2  of 'Me and my Grandma'
Also Eva, I am very interested in videography, and I would absolutely love to help you out with any kind of project you want to take on (and yes I am a girl). I know you'll probably never see this but that's ok, I tried :)
so I've had a crush on Eva for a while now and I just found out she's bi?! (Yeah I know I'm late af). But wow my bisexual heart is even more in love lol
i bet u and brent are dating
you sound like you were fake to them then ditched them out of no where while they were clueless about what happened. but do you and let people go as you wish but geez talk to the people you "love"
Love love love the cinematography! Indy Blue does something similar! Think y’all might be good friends!!
Oh my god I would love to do cinematography and travel videography but I’m too broke for that - one day ☺️❤️
Completely understand where you're coming from. I needed to hear this tbh.
AHHH OMG THATS WHAT I WANNA DO
theres gonna be some tea spilt ☕️👀
OMG Eva U love that you come out about how you feel. Everyone is here for you
omg I’m a Leo toooo
I think I understand where you are coming from. I've been there and distanced myself from some of my closest friends because I felt like they weren't on the same path as me. Some people, you have to let go of. But with people you love and who love you, communication is important and considerate. And you can grow closer to other people, while still remaining in contact with your old friends from time to time. If this is what you feel is best for you, and this is where God has guided you, then so be it. But remember to treat others how you'd like to be treated. You can put yourself first, without harming  others along the way. Wishing you the best
I want to travel and do all of those things 🤭
I love adventures lets gooooooo im very much willing to join you 😊
Honestly I think you resented your "friends" and you peaced out. Really wish you didnt make the first part of the video. You could of ran scot free 😂
is it possibly how to survive high school?
Are u and Brent finally dating?, also are u gonna be in a movie or something!
UM A 22:02 LONG MYLIFEASEVA VIDEO?! yes. please. 😍😩😭
Hey Eva just wanted to know how you do your cinematography because you have inspired and wanted to know how to start !!!
Im so happy for you :) <33
I’m a Leo too Eva. Leo Gang ♌️ 🦁
Am I the only one slightly annoyed with the fact that she called (MAMA) COCO'S GRANDCHILD COCO?
Schnitzel squad
notification gang checking in sips tea
ALSO THANK YOU FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES!!! I wish I could if I was an influencer. you have so much power! change the world girl!!
Eva omg is it the How to Survive High School series because if it is i will literally cry lol💞
breva explains relationship???
The boy in Coco is not called Coco, that's his grandmother.
Hey Eva, I don't know if you'll see this, but I wanted to let you know I absolutely love watching your videos and your vlogs. You are so real, so honest, and so encouraging! You inspire me so much... and one of the reasons I love watching your videos are they're so well done, and you're always so raw. Talking about things that we all go through, and it means so much that I and we are not alone in the struggle to find happiness. I am currently in a rough spot with a boyfriend I've been with for two years, and who I loved (and still love) since I was 15. I don't know what'll happen, and that's so scary. But watching your videos helps set a good head space for me, and helps the loneliness I feel be a little less (I don't mean that creepily). 
Thank you so much for making videos and vlogs... please don't stop! I always look forward to your new uploads. I hope you see this. :) @mylifeaseva
Brent & Eva part 2
girl same with the whole traveling and documenting!!!!!
I love surfing and traveling and dancing wish I had a partner for those experiences that only boys love
Okay but where is Paris?
I SOOOO love you girl keep doing your thing I’m definitely interested in DOMINATING with you just give me a few years and I got you lol
u should do a 10,000 calorie VEGAN challenge!!!!
Yass girls takin over! I can’t travel but I love to edit things I can make like shadows and saturation etc!❤️💞ilysm Eva
Girl I’m hella interested!! I’m just starting out but I’ve been encouraged to not follow a creative path. I’m currently a graphic design student but I think videography is my next step.
You say you're an independent leo but it seems like your happiness is very dependent on other people in your life. Do you need others, in order to be yourself? Just like the savage squad was a phase you've moved on from, I predict your Hawaii friends will be a phase too. And they probably don't care about you as much as you think they do... Also you don't need to cut people out of your life to grow as a person.
Do a part 2!1
Omg when she called Miguel Coco 😭🙄
Eva omg just saying but like holy shit yes! the things that you are creating is stuff very hard for me to find anywhere else, it is unique and your vlogs are something i really enjoy watching. thank you for all the hard effort you are doing for your fans and keep doing u x
I wish I could master the skill of editing and photography I got some minor skills at pictures I love taking pictures of the world around us and all the beings that come with it. I honestly feel like that would be a dream come true :) I love you Eva 💗💗💗
I love your new cinematic style. I’ve always loved you, but I eventually left your channel for awhile because it was the basic perfect teenage girl YouTube channel and I was tired of that. I recently came back and was honestly shocked by this new style. I immediately fell in love with it and you make me feel so happy and good about myself. I get so excited when you post a new vlog. And I always feel so inspired and seeing you with your friends makes me really appreciate mine. I love you <3
OH MY GOSH PLEASE MAKE A PODCAST LIKE UGHHH
evaaa, i would love to see you with bangs, dont know why but i feel that it would suit u🤧😍
EVVAAAAA PLEASE TAKE ME TO YOSEMITE PARK! I’ve been wanting to go so bad😬🌲🗻🏔⛰
Inanna Sarkis creates good videos/films
You + Brent.... THAT NEEDS TO BE YA NEW YEARS RESOLUTION
HOPE U’LL READ THAT!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
u r such an inspiration for me, u make me happy and u make me wanna pursue my dreams. Thank u for being who you r!!💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Love from Israel🇮🇱
I love how happy you've become 🖤
This was extremely inspirational! I stopped watching you’re videos cause I saw it was forced rather than the passion and love for the material! I’m glad you found you’re way and making genuine videos again ! I can’t wait to watch you’re videos again and see the real happy you
your outfit is so cute!!!
Personal development is a real thing that people should work on. A lot of people can get butt hurt and don’t understand. You do you girl I was in the same boat as you a few years ago and now I have my squads that I love more than anything!! ❤️❤️
Isn’t azzyland kinda like what u do
Get some individual braids 😫😫😫
This is the bessttt I didn’t know then but this vid was uploaded in my bday no joke!! 😍🥰
Luv u Eva!!
I've been waiting forever for the high school survival guide little series sooo...
Also you and Alli fitz would make good friends
BOX BRAIDSSSSS
Eva you should hire me, I’m 5’11 and every short girl needs a tall bestfriend 😂
I love your top 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😂🤩🤩
The whole video is just use being pretentious af lol
Eva I’ve been watching you since 2015 and I am so happy you are following your passion of cinematography with your new content it’s so authentic and I love the girl power. 2019 the year Eva evolves into the ultimate aesthetic vlog queen
For some odd reason I was very distracted by her necklaces
yes queen I want to travel and make amazing videos with friends too!!
I am actually interested in making video's with you. You inspire me so much!
And the big question you said if we got it right you would like the comment and is it your relationship with Brent?
Soooo happy for you..  I love this!
I just wanna say.. i am proud of you.. i’ ve been watching you for 3years now i think and you’ve changed a lot:) you seem truly happy and no matter the explanation you gave i understand.. sometimes we grow apart and i am sure you had your own reasons.. it doesnt matter what others think.. keep on living the best life with people that you love the most and keep on spreading the positivity❤️ luv u
give teala and sierra a chance to talk instead of ghosting them you owed them atless that 💞💕
Eva it's so nice to hear that you also want to create cinematic content as a woman! I'm also extremely into cinematography I can't even tell you the hours and hours I spent with youtube videos to grow my knowledge about it 😂
Even tho I'm from austria and speak german it would extremely nice to find more people like you who have the same vision (:
omg everyone needs to quit throwing shade cause like that’s low bbys
Wait, aren’t u working with Kelly???
I wanna travel around with you girl, film major over here (;
Hey girl heeeey 🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️
watching your videos makes me so inspired and excited for summer and just hanging out with friends and stuff like that idk lol
it’s so inspiring to see your growth! i can definitely relate to the whole “i want to go on an adventure but none of my friends will go” keep thriving!
Hi Eva I’m from Argentina and I’ve been watching your videos since 2016, and I haven’t seen you as happy as you are now. I love your videos and how you enjoy life and inspire other peolple💙
I will be your friend
Even photography is so male dominated. Its crazy
INDY BLUE!!!
I feel like being you’re friend I would have such good vibes all the time. In conclusion I want to be ur friend ❤️
17:12 ME😂
I would love to travel and conquer the world 👌🏼💪🏼
I love this ♡ also I think Shelby Church would be perfect to make cinematic videos with! every video I see from her always has amazing quality
damn every youtuber is editing like this now /:
is the high school you vs child you; is that the secret project???
hi you are the best
Honestly your videos and the things you say motivate me, thank u
I AM SO INTERESTED IN THIS OMG 💫
His name is not "Coco", it's Miguel...
im guessing "me and my grandma" is coming back!!!
Me and my twin are super into cinematography and we make home videos just for ourselves all the time. I definitely understand what you mean. It is so hard to find other woman interested in making amazing films.<3
I get the friendship thing soooooooo much. It's important to have genuine relationships and nurturing those.
Look at TravelLight channel. She does cinematic travel vids
you're going on tour
See yes ik i am too late but i got your book and i just wanna say thank you so much for writing that book it helped me out so much
I stopped following you a few years ago because you were making what everyone else was. It’s so refreshing to come back and see that you have grown so much and your videos are so appealing! Great job!!
Idk why people make such a big deal when people stop being friends??

I’m constantly trying to grow and better myself, and there are some people in my life who, when I hang out with them, I feel like it’s just the same shit and that they’re comfortable staying where they’re at while I’m trying to move on.

So I have no problem cutting people out of my life who don’t want to grow with me, or who put me down when I try to live my best life.
It’s not rude, it’s not heartless, it’s HEALTHY.


Like I don’t wanna hang out with other 23 year olds who just gossip and talk about the same shit 24/7
I wanna hang around people, however old they are, that share the same passions as me and that care more about real life than they do their fucking Instagram themes. And that’s the tea 🍵
Love you , love this video 💞❤💜
Is it me and my grandma season 2
if you want girl you make cinematic contents just look at To the 9s, two girls from Vancouver and they are amazing !
its miguel😂😂😂😂
I TOTALLY feel you on the cinematography topic. I've always wanted to film travel/lifestyle kind of videos but NO OTHER GIRLS seem to share the same passion as me for it. So for right now I'm just sticking to storytimes 🤷🏻‍♀️on instagram though, I've started to change my style a little! It's just hard because I feel like no one else gets the vision. But Eva, forreal, if you're looking for girls to join you on this journey- I'm 100% here for it
Hey Eva you are a huge inspiration to me and I LOVE your travel vlogs, the short instagram vids of your adventures, and your photography. I'm super intrested in starting viedography but Im struggling if you have any helpful tips I would greatly appreciate. With love, Liv <3
Honestly her travel plans are amazing
is how to survive high school coming back😂!
I want the high school series to come back
UMMM 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️I have spent the last two years on YT learning a lot about film and production. I’ve learnt adobe premiere pro, final cut, manual focusing, slow motion, colour grading, etc. I’m still learning a lot though, but I use Fashion videos as a means to learn!! I have always loved the cinematic space but YOU ARE TOTALLY RIGHT!! It is very male dominated!! Which is totally fine, but a bit discouraging if you wanna go out with the girls and film cool stuff too! ANYWAYS I WOULD LITERALLY COME AND DO COOL CINEMATIC THING WITH U. Just lemme build up my channel a bit haha and finish school 👍🏼
i genuinely want to be your friend and be around you, l would love to just sit and talk to you as i feel your vibe soo much , but its also partly that i have moves away from freinds and not letting negative people into my life and have found myself in that lonny space where i have no real people to talk to... you know ? probs not you will just probs thik im sad ahah but oh well i dont realy care ahah
i want you to do some of the things you used to but i also really like what you are doing now  i would like to do it with you but i am only 11 and 1/2
You guys grew apart :(
Growth comes with the ability to communicate. Yes you ghosted them and that doesn't seem mature and it gives the idea that you really did not care for them much. Enjoy your new journey and hope it fulfills you Eva
OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS EVA TO BUT MINE IS SPELLED AVA
Eva reminds me off my high school early college self ...now I’m 25 doing damage control 🙃 that’s exactly what she has in her future
I WOULD LOVE TO EDIT FOR YOU BUT IM 9 GOING ON 10
I’m a Scorpio, I see through the bs , lies can’t foooool me
Why all the hate comments
This video was so shady and horrible I can’t lol.
@haleypham has done some cinematic videos
Im with you! Let's take over these  boys!!!
omg HIRE ME!!! i love literally everything you’re saying (you probably will never see this) ♥️ can we please be friends?
You are the BEST! I can compare to you wanting to have girlfriends who you can just travel or go somewhere with, for adventure. I try to ask friends and be free-spirited but the majority of the time it's just me. It's hard to create and express my Instagram content but I'm learning. We girls got this!
She didn't talk about Adam, I feel like he's a really great man...things are really still confused in her mind
You're so cool Eva!
Bro yes please I’ve been wanting to make vids like this for the longest and have fun wit it but I just need to learn more editing skills, and I would die to travel and we’re like that and just get to experience life itself😅😟💕
ohhh my goodness please do more cinematic videos they’re my favorite 💘 do what you love, try more things, and remember i love youuu
People can tell when ur being true
Leo squad♌
I feel like you were really raw in this video. I love it.
I feel like so many people have been making new friends & getting rid of toxic ones lately. Even I've been hanging out with friends who make me feel good rather than the ones always trying to one up each other. These upcoming years, I really want to "cleanse my life", and I hope you guys are too!
I'm exactly like that I would love to do that I'm exactly like you
I love these videos when you just sit and talk and share your dreams and goals! I think you’re so inspiring and AMAZING. I love that you want to do something different it’s amazing!!!!!!
But like what Eva said makes sense. Sometimes you just have different paths
Merrell twins!!!!! That might work :)
Monica Church makes cinematic vlogs!!! She made really cool ones last year about a climb for charity and also about life in Seattle, 10/10 would recommend
You should check out the channel "A little bit of Monika
" she has some great cinematic videos and a great style. :)
She should do crotchet bc your scalp is fresh,and your hair grows a lot
I loved this video a ton! it helped me a lot
YOU SHOULD GET BRAIDS I THINK U WOULD LOOK BEAUTIFUL WITH LIGHT BROWN BRAIDS!!!!
i honestly love how open you are about everything in your life with us !!! 🙌🏼😍 u never fail to spill the tea sis
Sorry but coming from the perspective of someone who looked up to you for years I’m kind of disappointed. I know that I don’t know everything about the situation and that nobody’s perfect but I thought the last person to ghost a friend or not communicate well in a friendship would be you. If you’re going to end friendships for such selfish reasons then they at least deserve an explanation. Keep growing and achieving what you want but also actually consider the position you put your friends in. All the best girl and I respect how big you dream. I hope you achieve what you work for x
And like, like idk, like just therapy, like careers, like, like, like, like. If you can count how many times shes says like your amazing 😉
i really want to get into cinematic filming! i just need better equipment and some more inspiration. also have loved video making. I hope to travel next year and my camera will be in my hand the whole way. I totally understand what u mean. you want to execute your videos but you also want to be in them. i def need a girl to travel, film with and have fun. oml i would be so down. just got to finish year 12 first 0-0
You go Eva. Proud of you and excited for what's to come!
The people growing apart is soo truee like I'm going through that rn and like sometimes its just the way things are, its like a natural process. There's no major fights, scandal or beef, I feel like in there's like a cliche when you have to be friends for life. But we all change, humans adapt to different things, and someone you may distance with someone you saw being in your life forever.

edit: if you all like Eva's travel vlogs yall need to check out this girl Indy Blue, she makes amazing videos.
Mulan Is life♡
box braids
Girl, let's just travel the world and make cinematic videos
You and Brent,!!!
Eva has GROWN
IS IT’S ALL WILD MAKING A RETURN
Expectations vs reality
Wait r u still friends with Sierra???
i wanted to pull her necklaces out from inside her shirt the entire video
2:45 IS HOW TO SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL FINALLY BACK?😍
I am super interested in cinematography. I am a senior cinema major and would love to be a part of this! I love the effort of making women dominate that industry. lets go!!!
I finally got time to watch this and I actually think you just said like everything I've been thinking. And those cinematic videos are so cool!😍 I love so much traveling, making videos and taking cool pictures too. You are so inspiring❣️ Love you Eva, keep going like this!! 💛
FYI: Eva can outgrow whoever she wants for her personal growth. As an adult that is your right. And no she doesn't owe an explanation to anyone! :)
Crochet braids or braids in general
GIRLLLLL I’m literally a film major in college. I want to be a director one day and possibly act as well and the amount of looks I get when I say “I’m majoring in film” or “I want to be a famous female director” 😂 GIRLS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT OKAY
also a youtuber you might like is Luca Whitaker
I understand growing apart from friends it happens to everyone. However ditching them and not giving them a reason isn’t cool. Your friends always understand changes you go through and I know for sure they wouldve supported you. If they didint then drop them but you never know because you didn’t try
You should get braids!!!
Can you make a “how to make cinematic videos” ?? 💓 I love those types of videos and want some tips and tricks!!
Anyone ever think maybe Brent is gay? Let him continue growing and figuring things out
Merch or music
Yes, Eva. Have really been loving your content lately. It really shows that you are happier and you seem more authentically you. And that's something I've been able to look up to recently. Sending so much love.
#breva💜💜
I fell in love in the first ten seconds of the video. That is all<3
Yup. It can be very very very tricky making videos on YouTube as a woman and trying to not do girl specific content when that 10000% always gets the best traction. 
Stalk my channel. I cracked into a male dominated space with a female twist. 
Literally last year I was the only girl at a conference amongst a sea of men talking about photography and videography. 
And I loved being the one messing with the stereotypes. It’s fun. 
And I continue to do it now with short fun films on minimalism, living like Casey neistat, trying Wim Hof and other :) 

Also, I know what you mean about fakeness. I had a choice to move to LA or Australia/Iceland recently. I chose Australia because I need reality and only step into LA when my mind is strong and can handle set up situations. I have been on the side where I lost myself and was sucking up to big influencers and then on the other side when people were doing it to me and it really feels highly uncomfortable both ways. I don’t want to become that fake person again or have fake people around me. 

So I do hope we gel on a deeper level rather than the superficial shit because then we both know the friendship won’t last. 

Anyway. Hit me up if you wanna 🤷🏻‍♀️🕺🏻
I totally understand what you mean. Sometimes you have to lose people in order to find yourself.
You are not a good friend. U have no problem cutting nothing off. Your Hawaii frenz what u gassin right now need to really watch there back with loving you. MESS!
Are you making a new music video
Being able to travel and create beautiful content honestly sounds like a dream. 😌
I would love to be able to do that one day. ❤️
I know how you feel, sometimes you just grow apart from the people you love the most. It sucks...it really does :-(
It hurts you even more and who knows how long you've been trying to keep a connection with them because you love them. Once you realize the connection  is gone no matter what you do, there's nothing you can really do instead of grow and meet new people.
People are mad that you didn't handle it better and that you aren't more hurt about it.
Box braid or if you mix Argan oil,baobab oil or castor oil, and Shea butter that grows you hair
Miguel not Coco 😂
Monica Church is an incredibly talented videographer! I think she’s doing her own thing but I wanted to put her name out there for talented females in cinematic video recording/editing :)
Do braids !! 💞💞❤💜
Eva I have to go to college soon 
I'M SCARED 😞😥😥
U go gurl !!!! I totally love that idea of going against everything typical YouTube girls have been doing!! So excited to see your new content !
I lost all respect for her
Notice she said I WAS single meaning past tense
Has she not seen Indy Blue’s channel one of the best girl you tuber in editing like girl there’s a lot of them your just not watching the right stuff
GIRL! I lobe you so much but you need to understand that Meredith , Sierra and Teala have helped you grow into the person you are today ! From the experiences you had with them have taught you SO much about your passions and values so "dumping" them is not the right thing to do ! Growth comes from forgiveness,communication and connections so I really Reccomend you take time to speak time to the other girls because from the parts of your friendship I saw , you guys really needed the time you spent with each other! I think it's great that you're expanding your life and videos and I'm really looking forward to some sick new content but I don't want you to forget the people and experienced that you first became known for. I love you Eva and I hope in like 10 years you won't regret how you are currently transitioning into a new Eva ! Xoxo - Aimee
@stephilee
I LOVE cinematic videos!! I love making, creating and of course... being in them hehe. I try and create cinematic videos with my travel videos/vlogs, which I think are awesome just because I travel a lot during the summer and sometimes during the winter and I really want to show all the places that I have been to and make my videos super interesting.

I love that you're being so real with us, Eva! This chat is actually so inspiring and SUPER motivating, this video actually speaks to me, I completely get you :) Even for me, it's a struggle to create youtube videos that I think will be amazing. Once I start editing... I start comparing my videos to more pro videos and I keep thinking that no one will watch my videos because it's not the same quality as another video a YouTuber created. That pushes me to do better and better, and then I just end up not posting it or not doing it and  trashing the idea because it took so much of time to edit everything to it's "perfect standard." However, I barely speak in my videos and I really should, which I'm trying to work on not being so "camera shy" or thinking I'm going to say something stupid and then keep retaking that one shot so it can be perfect.  But continuing on, I'm currently in college and I can completely relate to you about not finding friends that like to do the same thing as you. I mean there are a bunch of people (mainly guys) that like creating cinematic videos, but no girls!!! Some of these people already have friend groups and are just super clicky, which I'm not about... I can't even find friends who like doing the same thing as me!!!! Maybe getting a few friends to go on photo shoots, but not so many ladies who are videographers or just know some great angles and like to play around with a camera and love to create videos too. 
I really love the process of creating content for my channel and I hope you and I can soon find friends who love doing the same as us soon! <3

Take Biotin and get box braids. That’s a really good protective style. Plus your scalp will be out so you’ll still be able to achieve that goal of your scalp being able to breathe. Then try twists. Do a deep condition, twist it, leave the twists in for a 1-3 days then take them out for a new style.
ugh I would love to travel and try new things and film it all
guys this is happening because the squad era of yt is done. ppl are into "free" lifestyle now so just wait til they drop this too. lol
Im so glad shes honest with us. It teaches me alot, positive and negative.
I really feel you about the cinematic videography stuff. I'm so interested by it and I really enjoy watching yours! For example your living in Hawaii video and your Tokyo vlogs are amazing! I really hope you will keep doing that and would love to make content together lol 💜
Haunted house update?

Eva, I connected SO much to this video! ^.^ I also have been working to figure out which relationships are the most meaningful for me and have similar beliefs about having people in seasons of your life and that there doesn't have to be drama attached to this. I also had been not doing and saying, etc. things that I've wanted to do with my life. My goal of 2019 is to be centered. For me this means being more present, doing the things I want and need to do, putting my energy into the relationships that I find the most reciprocity and inspiration for my life from, etc. I'm so proud of you and happy that you're do so well and getting your goals. Also, very inspired by your confidence! When I see other people being genuinely confident and loving themselves, it makes me feel like I can do that too. Much love, queen. <3
EVA When you were talking about creating travel and incorporating cinematography it really inspired me. I want to personally create that type of content, but I have been trying to figure out how to create it perfect, before even trying it. Go get it and honestly this sounds completely amazing.
i was single. WASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
5:00 I know EXACTLY WHAT you mean and how you feel. You're maturing. It's an amazing thing. I also got shivers when you said National Geographic Photographer. I 100% see that.
😂😂 I'm made so many pin points during this video.  One I loved how you kept bringing up Disney movies. Two when you were mentioning all you're LA  friends you only mentioned Brent. Three... GURL POWER WOOOO
Are you dating Brent
Omg what! I want to be your videographer!
also Sarah Dietschy does videos like you're mentioning. She color grades and talking about tech and stuff
EVA, I love what you're doing and it sounds like so much fun to be apart of. ;) 
Have you heard of Sorelle Amore? She's a fellow female photographer/traveler who I think you might get inspo from! Otherwise, your videos always give me positive vibes so thank you~
this made me fkn inspired
This was so nice and honest, like very good vibes from this video I feel like subscribing again
i freaking love you eva. i wish we could be friends because i feel like we think alike and you are just a fun and lovable  person. ive seen how far youve come over the years and jm so proud of all of your hard work and progress. youve been such a light in my life and you are keeping me going. youre videos on insta and youtube are crazy insane and im obsessed with how amazing they are. I wish i could travel w you lol. you are living my dream which is to travel the world and have genuine best friends.  Love you girl❤️
Hey Eva , can we be friends? 
I need someone to listen to me and give me inspiration each day ❤️
I love you 😍
I don’t like Brent at all and it’s a shame that Eva does not want to be friends with Teala and Sierra anymore. Just my opinion 🤷🏽‍♀️
#breva for 2019
What happened to your clothing line ?
where did u get ur shirts and necklace and bracelet?? they are so pretty!!:)
i love your necklaces
NEW EVA VIDEO WHO’S EXCITED?! 😍
to be honest, I like your voice like this. I think it was the super happy voice that turned me off from watching a lot of DIY youtubers in general and pushed me towards channels/people like Conan Gray,  Cat creature etc. So keep the chill videos going!  I wish I could help you out on your video/cinematic journey because that sound so dope but I'm 18 (senior in hs) *sigh*. Start the revolution girl!
Definitely @MonicaChurch!! She has a main channel just like what your channel used to be; beauty, lifestyle, etc. However, her vlogs are cinematic and travel oriented. They are beautifully editing and really well done. I would reach out to her, I believe both of you would be up for the same goals and mindset!
Everyone has the right to be around and distance themselves away from whoever they want regardless of what anyone thinks..Much love <3
OMG Eva I love you . Anyways your hair I have the same hair as you and I found that coconut conditioner is great. It makes your curls a bit more lose. Love your videos
hoping for true friendships like you were talking about, one day :(
omg I feel you. i genuinely love cinematic videos and i always wanted to create my own content. (i'm slowly working on it xd) i live in the Caribbean (St.Kitts to be specific) which is a beautiful island, you should definitely visit for a couple weeks. im pretty sure you won't regret it. 


btw ignore everyone who has something bad to say about you and your relationship with old friends. it is quite rude w/o knowing the entire story and any other details to make an assumption & accusations against you. it is not their right to determine who is right or wrong, or who's the bad guy in this situation. 


Love you lots Eva! do you boo <3
Eva you are so positive about everything that you do, and you are beautiful and sweet , but most of all you are real you don't act fake. You have changed my life with all the good that you have spread and all the positivity. 💗💓💓🤗🤗😄😄@MyLifeAsEva
I'm interested. I want to be friends lol (in a non creepy way, but this is my third comment ... in my defense I'm commenting as i watch) i have no experience though 😬 ...
IS IT TGE HOW TO SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL SEREIS
HOW TO SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL SEASON 2?!?
Box braids are always nice
Let's not disrespect Mulan like that k.
Hey Eva, I know you probably don't reply but what editing app do you use? I'm trying to start a channel with my friend
Eva, I really admire your drive and determination in regards to your videography passion. If I wasn't in college, and had more practice with that kind of technology, I'd be hitting you up as I type this. I've been going through a period of my life where I've lost the "friends" I thought knew me and had my back, and I have been having a hard time finding genuine, thoughtful, fun people to spend my time with. I've been watching you for literally 5+ years and I'm so happy that you have finally found your people and your passion. Sending you lots of love <3
I love Eva but she did not handle the Teala situation with maturity. She had every right to feel the way she felt, but her actions (aka ghosting her) were not of someone who is super mature. Especially considering she went through a similar situation with Meredith and decided to air her business out to the world. Eva is so wise but she still has alot of growth to do... Most of us do anyway.
i'D go with you on those adventures!!!! <3 I wanna do the same! I've been trying to dable with cinematic videography buutttt it's also a matter of access to the equipment necessary for this.
Fake af... but anyways
I havent watched you for such a long time, and seeing you mature so much is just amazing. Im really glad you decided to stick to your goal, you are so talented and kind hearted. You just gave me so much hope and inspiration... cant wait for your future content :D
This video made me rethink everything. I love this video, made me think about what makes happy and I don’t care what’s another people should think about me.♥️💞💗💖
Tbh I’ve never so been INSPIRED by a q&a
i like how she used Mulan as a reference but Mulan left FOR HER FATHERRR not herself shshshshwixn
You should wear space buns in your hair
You seem carefree now
wait .... brent isn't gay.
you should check out sparksss she’s more grunge style but she takes beautiful photos/videos and is really talented
Omg I wish I was an artsy gal. I would totally go on adventures with ya girl!
10:05 Caleb omg ım dyinggggg
yesss girl i'm the same i want to travel and be a photographer these like no girls out their i want to start a YouTube channel on it but i'm 17 cant really travel because i have no money lol, your my favourite YouTube i can realities to you so much
I’m gonna’ be completely honest here: since I subscribed to you back in 2015(ish) I had honestly lost interest in your content, since it reminded so much of everyone else’s. But sitting through this video you have really caught me again! It did really feel fabricated and false and I love this new outlook and vibe❤️❤️ see u in the vlogz
shes been going through a lot and yall have to bash her for accusations you cant even justify ? give her a break ,, no shade ,, but lets all leave that behind and welcome 2019 okay
Wait did you and Brent date? Or just friends?
Try Monat for hair growth Eva! 🚿 it’s amazing for healthy hair and hair growth!
my daughter bday on Jan 1st
Eva what you did was real shady my love. And you will one day regret how immature you handled the situation. Because a real friend would have first informed both Teala, and Sierra of how you've been feeling. And respectfully parted ways with them like a grown woman. They deserved to know what was going on. Instead of leaving them in the dark to figure out for themselves. That's NOT a friend love. 
But i hope these new friends don't play you like you played Teala and Sierra. Because when you do sneaky shit to people. Life has a way of humbling you, and then you're stuck sitting there lonely. Thinking how the fuck did i get here. You got to do better my love. And talking with them should have been tbe very first step. But it's not too late. God bless!!!!!
I want to get into cinematography as well. Like I love photography but I just don’t know how to get started on the cinematic side. Any advice???
Girl, bye.
15:35 this has literally been my goal/dream in life for so long. I just want to travel with some girl friends and get awesome shots of each other and have editing parties! Have fun! And dominate these boys\beat them😂!! I wish I could do this with you because I havent found anyone else who wants this😍😍
I cannot wait to see what you do this year you badass broad.
wtf happened to “it’s all wild”
I really love all your videos!!!❤️❤️❤️
SOMETIMES U DONT FEEL CONNECTED TO PPL IN YOUR LIFE ANYMORE ITS JUST LIFE SHE DIDNT DO ANYTHING WRONG
Girl you inspire me so much! I've always loved doing cinematic videos as well but unfortunately im a broke college student so I can't travel very much. I'll do look books and vlogs that kind-of have a cinematic vibe. I went to Greece last summer and I had a blast filming travel videos. I so badly want to buy the camera equipment you use, your content is so amazing! Maybe one day I'll be able to afford it! haha But just know im on board girl, my goal is definitely to film more cinematic style videos! I love what you're doing with your vlog channel I've been obsessing with how your editing and recording everything! btw your gorgeous & if you somehow end up seeing this my instagram is @cesleytaft would love to talk about ideas etc..!!!
She sounds dumb lol
Don’t ever feel bad for growing and discovering who you are and what you want💪🏽👌🏽 There is nothing more admirable as a person but especially as a woman than knowing who you are and embracing that❤️ I’m a 71/2 month pregnant woman and spiritually I’ve never been stronger which makes everything easier especially the way I view myself😇 So just be proud to be you no matter what that involves..own it‼️ Happy New Year and May God continue to bless you and yours throughout 2019🙏🏽
I feel you so well Eva... it’s all okay and completely normal to go through while we grow up <3 take care of yourself girl... love u
Try Katie betzing
YouTube frindships can be so fake and its such a complex world,everybody trying to fit in.Im not surprised about what happened with the "Savage squad". It always felt kinda off to me and after M.F s drama it all made a lot more sense.
Anyway,you're all grown * women so you can only learn from your mistakes and try to be better human being every single day.
I AM INTERESTED I LOVE TRAVEL CINEMATOGRAPHY AND IM STARTING A YOUTUBE CHANNEL i would love to talk to you sometime about it lmk if you interested in talking about it :)
Shade isn’t growth though?
You honestly inspire my too make videos like that and I would love to travel when I’m older and I would love to take video and picture and edit them to the best of my ability’s. Thank you for inspiring me Eva to grow into the person I am today and be proud and love more and more the things I am Passionate about.
Do a second part of the high school episodes!!!!
Есть кто с Рашки? 
:D
Girls that do cinematics? You need to check out Laura Reidd , she makes some cinematic vlogs and travels so much to cool places ! ✌🏽
I hope this is a question: “are you and brent official yet?” 🤭
Edit: OMG EVA YOU LIKED IT PLZ REPLY WE NEED TO KNOW! 😍
Honestly I really love the curly hair so leave it
I don’t think she researched hard enough, to /not/ find other female creators, that are cinematography oriented through YouTube.....
Anyone know where to get her shirt?? I need it😭
damn shading every 'friendship' she ever made
Me and my grandma
I love you Eva and you're magically turning into an even more beautiful person and i'm happy you are happy. But can I just say that you literally have made 10 people famous or "IG relevant" and none are colored/black. Now they're all making hella 💰 and we could really use more rich/successful blacks.
Can you make a video that gives a lil love to the black community. black entrepreneurs. Your people, our people. 😘😘
Jonna Jinton is a youtuber who is extremely talented with her videography (v late tho)
I’d try that! I have no experience but it looks so cool and fun
Omgg is How to surrive highschool coming back???!!
Merch make merch pleaaaSe
Eva is similar to Cardi B without makeup
get braids or cornrows w/ weave
Nihel I am with u I am with u gurl and Eva let’s go to Utah
I think at least tell your friends you want to move on considering you were there for eachother for so long. Just because people dont share your intrests doesnt mean they should be treated as though they never existed? thats a strange way to look at things condisering you believe you've been enlightened and grown so much
If you didn't make friends in hawaii I doubt you would dropped them way you just said which is really sad especially after watching a video from one of them saying you never reached out :( .....anyway . your 2019 is such a step up from your old content, but those are just my thoughts since you aired them out and I dont think thats a good vibe tbh.
goal for 2019: become as successful as Eva is on youtube 😍 

(Okay lets be real, even if I’m 1/4 as successful as her I’ll be happy haha)
Where are your necklaces from?
guys she has her own life and her videos are awesome so i mean what's the problem?!?!??!SERIOUSLY???i love you eva!!!
She as a way better connection with boys than girls . I wish that was more normal  ❤️❤️❤️
Breva is coming back that’s all ik 💕💕
How do I sign up to be your friend? If you ever hit London up, I'll take you on a tour from a 21 year old student perspective!!!
Eva, you've always been my favorite youtuber ever since I was 12 years old lol, I love you and I love the person you've grown in. You're so open and genuine! I also think your opinion on guys dominating the cinematography game is soo relevant and true! Your videos these past months have been so gorgeous and aestheticly pleasing! I'm rooting for you!
YASSSS for LIFE UPDATES😍
I think you meant you are Miguel, not Coco. Coco is the grandmother haha.
bro friends grow apart get over it Jesus christ
feel weird to like ''autopromote'' myself but i'm an art student and i loooove photographie but i live in canada.. still love to travel and film so maybe we could do something one day.
Katie DeFeo is such a good videographer!!!!!! Check out her channel
Pretty sure Mulan went home. and also when people said ur natural hair they didn’t mean straightened in braidszzz
when u tried to be a meme channel at the begging....-
So very true, I put so much pressure on my ideas and it's best to just let it flow
why this industry male dominated
FIRST PERIOD STORY
You encourage me to make 2019 a better year
IM INTERESTED!
eva where is paris your cat?
I am a Leo tooooooo !!!! Yay we’re zodiac twins
You know what Eva, before watching this video I started reading all these hate comments and I was kinda agreeing with them but after watching this I totally agree with you! This is not "shading" anyone is just you growing up spiritually and just trying to be better. Support you 100%  LOVE❤
I wanna go ✋🏽 i would've gone 😭
This video just upset me bc I love Eva. What she did to Sierra and Teala is truly messed up.
I would love to be friends with you 😊
Eva i love ur hair
Ava has like inspired me so much to do so many things I love that she can inspire me by not even trying to inspire
Eva kinda hypocrite at this point, because she been nasty to Mere and now she did exactly the same thing.
BREVA IS COMING BACK AH HAHAHA I KNEW IT
Your content is icky now. Eva I used to love you, but now the only thing you do is make Brent Riveria videos and Q and Evas. Vlogtowski is no better. I miss Literally My Life Is-type Eva not the clout chaser you've become.
Eva, I dont know how youtubers be friend with other youtubers, but maybe you can be friend with Monica Church, since she also makes cinematic video. You too hanging out together will make a great video 😊
Such a great video. This is the Eva i fell inlove with. The Eva that inspired me to even start on youtube. Yes you are evolving as we all are....but you are such an inspiration as a creative and I love that about you. Can't  wait for all the great content in 2019
GIRL you need to hit up Indy Blue!!!! She's an amazing girl videographer check her out!
I honestly and truly understand this and I feel like I'm going through the same thing with my friends as well. Gheez are you reading my journal?
I love you so much
What you’re doing is 100% a dream for me, like there are my more realistic dream goals, but what you’re doing is a fantasy dream for me. To travel and appreciate all this original natural beauty, have dependable fun friends, an actual fantasy. I realize it’s unrealistic for you to actually notice this and reach out, but I would rather say this and take the chance.
I would 100% adore getting to work with/for you, a chance of a lifetime to actually meet you and know you, yes please
I love your hair
you need some Emma Chamberlain in your life
We already knew the “savage squad” was over when she unfollowed them
I think one of the most beautiful parts about your channel is the name “my life as Eva”. We’ve all been through these phases! I started watching you in middle school and I’m now post-grad doing a year of national service in LA. I’m the one begging my friends to do weekend road trips too. Your transparency is refreshing and all I have to say is keep being you ❤️

(ps: I’m an aspiring filmmaker so if you ever wanna grab coffee ((I know it’s a long shot)) lmk. I just finished my first documentary.)
I am just going to say that we are long lost sisters. Seriously!
it would be a dream to be a part of something like that, like i love where your mind is at. Hope you find what you're looking for!
Listen, everyone does this. Self love is being selfish and youtube allows you to talk to people who support you. You are amazing
eva all i want to do with my life is work in conservation and photography. u have such an amazing life. it’s like u r literally me in 10 years. i love u! and ur my role model!
Eva this has literally inspired me so much! I have always been in love with cinematography and world travel. I aspire to be able to travel the world and capture the beauty it has to offer! When ever I travel or go on little road trips I love recording it and putting little films together! I’ve uploaded some of those videos and they are my favorite videos to edit and playback to be able to relive those moments. They are no where near your quality content, but I remember watching your video “A Week In Paradise” and that video set off that part of me and made me want to film and travel! I hope that you dominate your dream and be a girl boss, good luck and I wish you well! ☺️
Have you checked out Monica church she seems to be going through the same thing
WHO CAME FOR THE TEA
box braids
so basically you want to make FART content
I think it is merch
Is the thing coming out this year possibly me and my grandma??????!???? I hope so bc I just binged that show  YESTERDAY and it is driving me CRAZY to know if there will bc another season! Love you Ava!
Notice how she says, "I have some really good friends in LA, & Brent"
YOU SHOULD WATCH LAURA REID HER CINEMATIC VLOGS ARE AMAZING! SHE IS SO UNDERAGED. SHE HAS 200K AND SHE DESERVES SO MANY MORE!!
EVA I MENTIONED YOU IN MY STORY ON INSTA AND SENT YOU A MESSAGE ON THERE AS WELL!! Take a look please!! Let’s be travel buddies!! Teach me your ways!! Let’s kick boy butt!!!!!
Be friends with me lol I’m down for anything lol
Wow Eva after watching this my perception of you changed 180 degrees. It’s so refreshing to hear such a successful YouTube pioneer acknowledge the double life that your fellow you tubers portrayed on screen. And to see how your future goals and growth are going in such a deep and empowering direction really is encouraging for those who want to follow your lead. Keep it up and even bigger things are coming your way!
"Something you really want is coming back"

If it's Season 2 of HOW TO SURVIVE HIGH SCHOOL, I'm gonna jump for joy.
on 2012 youtube, there was lilly singh too
You are so beautiful u don’t deserve the hate and people just need to keep their opinions to themselves and ILYSM EVA hope u see this!❤️💙♥️💜💋🖤💋💋💋
I’m late on this but you best be knowing this is gonna be teaaaa
You should check out Mara Samartzi. She is a famous greek youtuber. Some of her videos are quite cinematic. Watch: Morning routine expectations vs reality
Braids! Like as a hairstyle! Braids really grow your hair like a lot of you keep them well
Been a silent viewer for awhile but i just wanted to say this video is GIRL POWER GOALS. If I lived in LA and had the courage to quit my job I would totally be your nerd out cinematography buddy, I hope you kill it and get more girls into this space!
Girl you don’t have to explain yourself or apologize for anyone! You are on a journey of such self discovery that you need to go through for yourself and no one else. Keep finding what sets your soul on fire 💓
Ok this is amazing I’m only a young girl but I really see myself doing this and thus made me really happy
#spillingtheteasis
i just watched a 2 minute ad for you sis because you deserve that money, coin, cha ching, bling ya know im sayin. love you the most queen
omg.. when i kept hearing u talking about "protective hairstyles" all i kept thinking is "she needs some black friends" ... girrrrrrrl if u dont just go on youtube and type up "protective hair styles" theres thousands of videos with girls that have the same curl pattern as you with protective styles.
Seriously, Id love to travel and film and be creative. Annddd be a strong woman in industries dominated by men. Like yes!!!
I really want to get into videography but I don’t get to travel much! This really inspired me to work hard to peruse that goal!
Do you want to climb kilimanjaro with me?
Makaka
did u know u got nominated for a Shorty award??? Storyteller of the year baby! yup. i voted for you.
Waiiiitte... 9 MILLION SUBSCIBERS... whoaa!

#Thriving
I love you
I think the the  youtube primem show with your grandma is thing that's gonna come back
uhhhhhh MEEEEE HELLO EVA
I love the idea that you’re trying to dominate as a female in cinematography. There aren’t enough of us! Thank you for sharing this! It was so motivational
Is it’s all wild coming back? Is that what it is? ☺️
proud
When is your birthday? I’m a Leo too😄
these comments thoooo....
Dame ya Both a gonna have a kid named brneva almost so weird like ya both
Next protective style u should try is box braids!!
What kind of camera do you use to create those videos? And apps? I love taking pics and edit them but video is like a whole other level I would love to try!😊
Wait, people really think she’s dating Brent? They’re making collab content. It’s not real lol
why th is everyone just attacking her in the comments. jeepers creepers
who thinks Eva  is coming out with merch
and this is why I still watch you after so many years. I am done with the cookie cutter girls YouTube. Not only are you turning into a beautiful young lady right in front of our eyes but you are finally YOU ! I'm excited for your new style of Vlogging, the raw content. please bring your clothing line back ! and make it 100% Eva style !
shay Mitchell??
Filming at "sunset hour" isn't new or innovative, literally everyone is doing that right now
1. You are super inspiring and i wish i knew how to film and edit like you its always been a dream of mine i never chased. 
2. You are just inspiring in the actions you do and how much you've grown and i want to reach that level. 
3. Why in the heckers do your friends not want to adventure with you like what.
4. I wish i could have an actual conversation with you to see how you managed all this growth and etc like i said you've been very inspiring to me recently.
OMG imma leo too! aug.3💞
EVA — THIS is the Eva I subscribed to! I’m so here for this new shift in your life. Continue to be confident and courageous! This video pushed me to bring my creative ideas to a reality. Truly inspiring. Much love and keep up the cinematic videography! Lots of my friends including myself I trying to enter the space and it’s all about support one another. Cheers to breaking the glass ceiling in 2019 and beyond!
Brent likes you 😆😂😜
i wanna go on trips and adventures and film them but i just don’t have a good editing software or camera that would look good😫
Everyone in the comments needs to chill out. This happened years ago. She didn’t fit in with the crowd she was with. She wanted to do her own thing and she did it.
#Brava
Please adopt me, everything you are saying is my life goal
#breva
So we just not gonna talk about ADAM in the comments? Okay.
Eva, my dream for the last five years has been to be a film director/cinematographer, and to work with a girl like you who shares the same dream. I hope one day that dream comes true (it would be incredible). Just wanna remind you that there are still girls like me out here <3
ASPYN!!!!!!!!! SHE HAS AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPGHY TRAVEL VLOGS!!!!!!!
yes but, Mulan left her family to save the life of her frail father, and take his spot and bring honor to her country and family. 
Not for her own self-interest. Not to cut ties for no reason and hurt their feelings- even if inadvertently.
For those shading t, if you watched her video then you would know that she said she reached out to talk abt things in person and that didn’t happen. and this video was the first time she heard any of the things eva was feeling.

you don’t ignore your friends when they’re trying to fix an issue with you and then go talk abt it in a yt video.
Seriously though? I feel the same way and say the same thing and they still wouldn't want to go ..I need friends like you Eva!!!Call/ Text me... I'm always down for an adventure!
LIZA KOSHY X 100
so is Brent your home
what is her blog channel???
Just because people have different hobbies and aspirations doesn’t make them hollow... I understand what you’re saying about growing and stuff which is great, but it doesn’t mean you have to bring others down or be shady. If 2019 is about being true and honest then you should have been honest to their face.. this didn’t have to turn to YouTube. I still love you and your content but I just think that was a bit rude :/
Make it a girl thing!!
Where is Brent vs Eva😏
me too Eva !! I´d love to go on a trip… the funny Thing is, that´s exactly what I wish for! Traveling the world making Pictures of each other with a best friend! And I´m also searching for real good friend´s, who understand me, are Kind of similar, are interested in some Things I wanna do with a friend, and who have true feelings for me and our friendship. What I really search in a Person is that they always tell me the truth and what bothers them, that I don´t have to look deep into their soul and try to see what they are really thinking!    you inspired me soooo much with this Video and I looove your editing skills, your saturations and colourcoordinations ! Love you kisses a few years fan Fiona  sadly I live very far from you and Hawaii .. in Austria, Vienna
@sejalkumar
Loving this realness!!! You seem so happy and healthy!
You’re such a beautiful soul, you shouldn’t have to explain why you aren’t friends with people... it happens, it’s life.  Love it girly ♥️
Eva you really inspire me. You have shown me that we as women can do it all, You have shown me its better to be yourself, and finally you have shown me that sometimes you have to sacrifice “friendships” to better yourself. Thank you. I really enjoy your videos and I always did.- a fellow Evanator
Eva can we be friends?
I would love to be apart of the same thing because I find sunset and old fashion movie videos like urs to be the best to watch because ur not just watching the person in the video, ur also watching the edit and background around the person which I find so beautiful and amazing @mylifeaseva
What happened to Paris?
I know everyone thought that Eva was being petty and can have friends with different interests but some people want to focus on growth on themselves and sometimes it's easier to surround yourself with people who understand what you want to do and be. And like she said finding that connection can be when you relate to what you both found important.
Wait what happened to your clothing brand- It’s All Wild? and your cat paris?
Oh the nugget is its all wild!!!!!
EVA I AM A VIDEOGRAPHER AND I AM A GIRL
What happened to Adam?!
WoW no offense or sum , but I kind of forgot about you , damn
Sheesh we don't know the full story so I don't think anyone should speak so deeply into or about her friendships
Eva, you should check out Sorelle Amore! She is super knowledgeable on different photography methods, minimalism, personal wholeness and more. I think her vibe would go along with what you are seeking. She is very raw and herself in front of the camera!
ur gonna make a music video
Eva there is plenty of girls who who do cinematic content all I heard you say is oh boy oh boys like it’s okay if you like them no one is going to judge you
MEEEEEE MEEEEEEEE MEEEEEEE AND MY FRIEND!!
I understand what its like trying to fit in, having to talk about the same topic all the time in order to not be left out. Yes they're your friends but they may not understand whats happening to you so this is your life, you cant possibly stay with the same friends forever. People change
Accidentally paused at 6:05 and her face is hilarious. No hate, you’re beautiful Eva!!!!
It’s amazing how driven she is!! She will not stop until she’s the best version of herself and achieves her dream💕
I completely understand this. I don’t have friends like everyone else. I rarely talk to the couple that I have and we almost never hang out. This year I’m trying to make new friends as well as start my YouTube channel and Instagram. I think you made a great choice with moving on from those friends

Edit: I love cinematography and I do shower 😂
Ugh yes I applied for that videographer roleee😭😭 I studied film and screen specifically cinematography 😩 still keen tbh hahah
Wow those comments are wild 😐. I love you eva. You make mistakes but as long as you are learning as you go you will be fine. 😘
Your videos absolutely inspire me to be a healthier person and I’m interested in a lot of the things you are, ignore the comments calling you shady and fake because No one knows what happens behind the scenes. Please keep doing you and I love you.! XOXO
This is by far one of my favorite videos of yours!!! Showing your real self is what YouTube culture is about now and I am living for it!! You seem so happy and yourself and this video has inspired me to try my best to come out of my little shell and do what makes me happy and not care about what other think about me or what they believe I should do because I’m the end it’s not up to them it’s my life not there’s. Much love for you Eva❤️
Lmao she made no sense. She talking about growth but she talking about Mulan. I’m confused
great news Eva!! sounds like you know what you want from life and what you need to grow as a person, keep looking for those people to share your world with, you're right on track and where you're headed sounds awesome :) ...p.s. if you're looking for some more Youtuber inspo, I started watching Freya Haley & Nika Erculj last year, they make simple, cinematographic vids that are rather enjoyable.
Mee!!! Cinematic.... Soon lol
Cutting out fake people is one of the best things I have ever done! I just felt so much more confident in myself , my thoughts and goals.
So is She and Brent dating?
I'm a Libra!!!!! No wonder I relate and like you so much
never enjoyed a qna like this one, mostly because i can relate to everything esp being in company of people who dont seem to be inline with what you want to do and you become someone your not just so you dont offend them, and Iwould love to connect with you too, thats the type of content im really interested in too although i dont have the best camera.
I LITERALLY WANNA DO THIS! I just don't know where to start, the money to travel or to get the equipment. If I lived by you girl id be your assistant. Your vlogs give me vibes and it's amazing you're the only girl out here doing this!
can't wait to sip some tea in 9 hours☕️☕️☕️
Dude pick me!!! If you pay I'll go anywhere and everywhere my instagram is @jessicagell24 and I love travelling specially if it is around nature! I actually realize the same thing you did, about all girls in youtube doing the exact same thing and for a while that's what I liked, I started having instagram because they always did giveaways there and I wanted to win something (i never did) but little did I know my instagram and youtube was full of beuty and fashion stuff that I can't afford and I don't really care about. 
Now I know that what I like and the content I want to make is all about traveling and nature, and things that actually inspires me, I just got sucked in this "girly world" and didn't realized that there was so much more.
 I'm glad you dicided to go and be the better version of yourself, I hope this year you actually find what you're looking for
these comments r a mess lmao
My beautiful friend Evelyn studied film, and she is starting her Youtube channel :) She's 100% a traveller, and has an incredible kind, giving heart. Basically she is your girl! Her name is Evelyn A on Youtube and evelynaira on instagram :)
#Breva
I want breva to happen fr!! #Breva
Why is everybody telling so much hate?Don't tell me that you have never experienced that a friendship didnt work anymore?(I am a german so my english is probably very bad)😂😂😂😂😘😘
I want to do cinematography but I’m still in school and I’m from Bangladesh Here people are not so supportive 🙂
Namaskar Eva, I was drawn to this video. I am soooo here for the traveling, dp'ing, challenging yourself, and doing it with bad ass females. I'm so here for all of that! Ive been in the independent film industry for alil while now and dp'in (cinematography) and traveling is something I am passionate about. You can look me up @unveilingnaava and www.unveilingnaava.com .  mztifarahnaava@gmail.com. Love and Blessings
Why the hell is everyone bashing her for sharing her opinion?!?!
anyone notice the not so subtle shade she was making towards the savage squad....
Eva stay on your journey. Anyone who hasn’t lived through something similar to you, Teala, and Sierra won’t understand. I’ve been through a similar thing with my friends and even if they still want to connect people just grow apart and maybe you will one day grow back together. I’ve grown SO MUCH as a person since I realized what I needed. The people saying you just dropped them and were being petty don’t understand and don’t know the full story. I obviously don’t either but I will assume the best. You look like your doing great! Keep it going!
This Esme makes amazing cinematic content with her horse. Just a suggestion if you want to check her out!
I want to be ur friend eva
I totally understand everything you said, ur so real and i love that, even from watching your past videos compared to now i can tell youve grown so much and girl to girl in this world i feel like proud of you whether thats weird or not, i love the energy you put out and u really inspire me to keep being motivated with what i love to do even if i feel alone in it at the time and im 20 still trying to figure everything out and uve accomplished so much and i hope ur proud of urself too<3
NOTIF SQUAD FROM THE PHILIPPINES!!! ❤️
you guys stop being mean to eva. she is a grown independent woman and is allowed to do what she wants, she made this video to inform us not for you to shade her. WE LOVE YOU EVA💕
love your videos eva, keep on the fire edits. i would love it if anyone had any advice on how to color grade like this?
i think she's coming back with new clothes for her line or is partnering up with someone 2 create a new line of clothes
I always did wonder if Eva felt this way during that time Sierra called her up to do a "Pregnancy Test Prank On My Best Friend'S'" video, yet, the prank was only for one best friend, Teala. And Eva was just the prop to help create the prank/content?

I feel like this issue is based on perspectives. 

You see, usually i don't comment on these kinds of things...but i feel like I have so much to say only because I've been through both sides of the stories and this is a tricky one. Im gonna start off by saying, I'm very happy no one is being bitter with each other, its almost as if, what happens, happens or for the matter of fact - happened. It's clear that you obviously out grew the friends you've had, which is normal and a part of life. When you learn about yourself and start to accept it and love it, you change and grow and sometimes your friends atm cannot move forward with you or even understand it which is tough. Been there, done that. But I really don't like how some people bash Sierra or Teala for this though, as if they are the problem or they are only "content" people and cannot simply achieve this "enlightenment stage" that Eva is going through. I genuinely do not think this was the case at all. I've also been in their shoes (maybe not the exact same size but  same style shoe, as in, i dont know what they are going thru exactly but I've had a similar experience). I feel like, you out grew them and struggled to separate without possibly giving them enough explanation, I mean they were your best friends at a point no? I also just hopeee you didn't leave them to feel at fault, or made them feel like you are at a better level then they are.  Every one has their own time in life.

TBH these are just my thoughts and opinions, and im basing it off of my own experience. But at the end of the day, no one really knows anything right? but just the three of you. And maybe the three of you still even struggle to really understand each other. Who knows. 

Always praying for the best though, and positive vibes.
 Keep up with the amazing videos/vlogs Eva!
My friends are the same; never up for spontaneous adventures. I need more adventurous friends!! When I build up my career I'm gonna start doing things alone because you can't wait forever.
Also, your videos have been really beautiful lately. I loved the Hawaii vlogs and your videography/editing. It's so epic! Can't wait to see what you do in 2019
Eva would have a straight reason if she wanst dating Brent and she changed the subject about how she was proud of him
Why are you all so involved in this like you know her lol. Get a life.
I would be so interested - just said it
What did u just say honey Brent is ur boyfriend not friend
Everyone is over here attacking Eva, but honestly these are her decisions... If she felt like she shouldn't have to keep up a fake persona then good for her for making the decision to cut out toxic friends...Eva, much love to you
Woah this commment section tho...
Woah this commment section tho...
Eva should’ve just disabled comments because she’s getting so much hate
What I don't understand is that when Eva branched out and distanced herself from Sierra and Teala everything was fine, but when Mere did it, they called her out :( all the love to you Eva, I'm happy you did what made you happy. I can see your realness and glow of happiness and I hope there's still love between all of you because that was a fun time, but I'm happy y'all are doing your own thing now.
I love u
We should all just unsubscribe
So when is Brent coming out?
The entire video is just Eva making dirty jokes and Brent pretending not to understand them😂
3:35 Eva:I've been wet since we started 😂

Anyone think Ava was talking about something else when she said Brent had an average sized but hard working... heart? 😂
“I came out all wet and she was confused”
6:38 seems like they wanted to kiss but ended up fistpumping

6:56 I just wish I knew what exactly were they talking about 🤣🤣😂
8:56 😮😮
Brents face when eva says she hooked up with his brother.
the amount of dirty jokes in this video😂😂
I love how the subtitles say “bread” instead of “Brent”
4:54 Brent thought it was going somewhere else😂
11:15-11:40 is just wrong

I am just speechless this vlog was so good all I can say is that you are one of my youtubers
Hey Eva I saw in bizardwalk you were looking so good hey did you enjoyed when you were acting it was fun right
2 points for me 1 for you at rock paper.... i guess i won but we can say that you have won lol
i love this type of insight into your vlogs like a 1 to 1 chat instead of a just a voiceover that’s so innovative and cool💞
I wanted friends like that since I was 3. Never found one☹️
OMG * imagine being around this cute guys *
omg your trip is awesome <3 and also the editing can't be better! good friends, good trip... SO PERFECT <3
lost, won, lost in rock paper scissors. haha XD XD
As one of your older audience this video was legit amazing ! Such good vibes . It’s so hard to give you feedback because this was so good .......
MyLifeAsEva, you won 2/3 lol gg
Love this new format! And I too love Yoga with Adrienne. Best yoga instructor on YouTube imo! :)
I can relaaaate “i want friends that are down!”
Girl:   1.You just made me wanna go to Hawaii
          2.How did you beat me at Rock Paper Scissors 2 times?!? (Tell me your secrets)
          3.Just glad you had a good time
Eva’s editing is so fire
love allll your outfits! i wish i had your friend group! ( not that i want to steel them from you) love you so so much!
Just subscribed to your vlog channel I am going to watch them after this!
that yellow surfboard hanging up in your air bnb was shaped by Ken Bradshaw (THATS what the logo is) and he is or was a famous surfer and a close family friend of mine
I actually used to live in Hawaii on the island of Maui it was really fun there also you look really pretty 💖💖💖💖
you’ve got the most gorgeous hair
Could you please do a shower hair care routine? Ly Eva 💜💜😍 your hair is amazing!
Amira definitely likes Eva
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR NATURAL HAIR
I wish I was you, you have a perfect life and fun.
Btw not saying this in a mean way I LOVE YOU
girl your editing is insane!!!!!!!
this is so cinematic wOwZA
I really like this format for this kind of vlog! It makes it easier for us to understand what you're trying to bring accros/show us. X
E-emmm... CUTES PERSON💞
V-very funny😂
A-amazing🤩
😠its  winter in holland (nederland)   #socold
I loved the Way You did This editing with the speaking in the background❤️❤️😍😍
I met Louis at Banán one time and I fell in love ngl
YASSS my family is also glutin and dairy free
Ah, her hair is better than mine 😭 I have a bad hair day everyday 😂
If I was about to start my period I wouldn't wear bikini to workout
i dream to make as good quality content, her editing is just amazing. keep on the hard work you're killing it!
You video editing is literally amazing.
i had the same hands as you for rock paper scissors, and i‘ve wanted to revisit hawaii for the longest time. maybe we’re twins ❤️
I am wondering whether she is still friends with Teala and Sierra. I got that feeling that Eva is craving so much more in a friendship, like emotional intelligence and spiritual attachment, which Teala can't give her any more.. I love that she changed her perspective! :)
this is INSANELY absolutely positively amazing
It's so beautiful there! EVA YOUR EDITING IS SO GOOD
OMG. You're so lucky to have friends like that who love you just the way you are. Your trip looked so cool. and the format you used for this Vlog was the right one.
I love this type of videos

I think you should do more vlogs like these, it's so unique as it's almost like a documentary, or you storytelling, and it feels so much more personal and REAL.
Ahh Eva won the Rock Paper Scissors 😂
The part with the fighting couple sounds exactly my friends
This is honestly such a beautiful video. I can tell that Eva worked really hard on this and it came out AMAZING! I also lowkey want to go to Hawaii so bad right now! #goalz
Omg this is my ultimate favourite video! They style of it is so amazing and seeing you’re true friendship is so lovely! Please do more videos like this where you talk over certain events in your life! Love you the most!
You should move to Hawaii, it sounds like you already have the perfect life set up there!
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL! I loved that kind of video

Can you please do a Swim suit collection!!!! ♥️
I just realized that Eva has been on YouTube for the longest time and STILL doesn’t have merch!!!  Idk why I just realized that. Love u Eva ❤️❤️❤️

Edit: wait she has a clothing line though! So it’s not really that important when she has something better than merch which is that
I really liked this style of vlog!! It felt like you're a friend of mine who just got back from a trip and is telling me every detail hahaha it was super nice and felt personal!!
Omg i loves this vid so much it felt like you brought us along with you witch made it even more fun to watch❤️❤️❤️❤️

I was in Hawaii last month🏝⛱🏖🌅
I love this vlog and the way you did ittt! It’s so nice😍I’ve been meaning to finically watch this and glad I got to it😍. This whole vlog is amazing!!
Honestly, I needed some wholesome content in my life and this definitely felt like it. Loved the style of the video and my only recommendation is that I wish your friends introduced themselves because it'd be cool to have them promote themselves as well? I haven't gone to their social media yet so idk if they have lived on the island for a long time and what their stories are, so that intrigues me. Much love!
Omg I literally LOVE Eva's style in her videos 😍 I LIVE for it oml
I love this video, I literally made multiple screenshots. Your channel really inspires me. 💖
I won the last round against you love you so much and just keep being you

@MyLifeAsEva I love how as soon as you get out of the water you wipe your eyelashes and then lick your fingers.. When I'm out of the sea I lick the back of my hand.. I absolutely adore the taste of the saltyness that the amazing ocean leaves and has imprinted on me,  as soon as I step out of the water. 👣🌊👣❤👣🌊👣

Love you soo much
If you gained 50 lbs, do you think they would still be friends with you? #no
I think you need to hire a videographer when you go to Hawaii, it takes you out of the experience when you’re filming
I love how this was vlogmas but it’s the end of December and she hasn’t posted anything-
If I had your body I’d walk around in a bikini everywhere

This is how my 20’s better play out
This is the best vlog I’ve ever watched
I just stumbled acrossed your video, its great by the way ! I used to see you a little when you made videos with niki and gabi but i wanted to say your natural hair looks beautiful. I like how you're actually being natural and not like everyone else who preaches that you need to love yourself and be natural, etc. when they wear extensions and lots of makeup and what not. It's nice seeing someone like famous actually embrace it and not just say it without doing it.
loved this it was so cute and it’s definitely CARMel
you lost i won in all 3 of them
To make these kind of videos better I think your friends should talk more if they are comfortable in front of the camera. 
Anyways loved the video. Your friends seem cool 😎 💜
I loved so much I love you eva
I have been to all the places you mentioned
you beat me at rock paper scissors!
You beat me loll! :P

YoU HaVeN'T TeXtEd me BacK For LiKe ThE wHoLe DaY BrEnt. (me: falls out of chair then says"PREACH SIS."
This vid was awesome! Maybe try voicing over without showing you because at some points it takes away from your editing skills(which are amazing, I love your editing!)  and makes your videos amazing! But i really like this idea and if you don’t change anything it’s still really good Eva💖💖
Bruh I bet Brent was jealous with the surfer boys with Eva 😂
You lost I picked rock and then rock and siccors

GIRL!? What happend to the first video about how happy you are? It was such a beautiful talk! Showed how true you are?! 🙁💗
I love this video 😍😍❤️❤️
I love !!!
Great video! Also, I think Amir likes you
I really loved this format for your Hawaii vlog, because you can just feel the love here. You can just tell you fell at home and peaceful whenever you’re there. I actually felt really connected with what was going on. I wouldn’t prefer this format for a regular travel vlog because sometimes we just like to see the adventure. But like you said for the specials videos it just make it so much more memorable. You’re videos always inspire and I can’t wait to see what you have in store for 2019.
Me and my best friend, like we have other friends but they're not as close as us, so when sometimes she turns to me and says
"Have you ever gone to the comfort Inn?"
"Have you ever gone hiking?"
"Have you ever gone to New Hampshire"
And I'd say no.
and she'd be like
"We'll guess what? You're coming with me next time!"
 WHATT?
I WON!
Eva : I want friends who are down ! Get friends like that 
Me : Yeah ... I don't have money for that ... so ...
you look good

Who else loves Eva's style
Umm....she just snatched her own wig.....😂I'm shook
“i actually cook a lot”
*“wait this is ginger?”*😂😂
...
Is this house Pinterest or my fav youtuber house?
this motivated me to clean my room  lol
You literally just showed me my dream home! You’re SO pretty!
the "zen den" is my absolute favorite. But honestly your house is one of my favorites I have seen on youtube!
It is the house of my dreams
Your decorating style is just on fire.
Eva’s house is like living in tumblr or Pinterest!
Lol my google picked your voice up😂😂😂😂
Your house is so amazing, well organized, so open, light
I really like your house
You have a very good style and very good life style
I wish I could be like you, but I can't



Please like if you love Eva
This house, IS my DREAM house. Like honestly..im in LOVE O_O...! <3

I wouldn’t be surprised if Eva was a mermaid
I love beach homes. Love the Blues and whites beach theme through ur place. Thts how I want my dream beach house to look like but I also want the color yellow around the house cuz yellow is my favorite color.
10:50 I lost my mind with how relatable those moves were. Yes girl! Rip that wig off!
Why can’t I have dat house...............
Her house is litteraly like if a pro roblox, bloxburg builder made a bloxburg house, and then it came to life, you know what I mean.

How is everything still white and wow. Your beautiful and your house is too!!
I love your style! You house is so aesthetic and for some reason it reminds me of the ocean 😂
From looking at her Instagram you’d think she doesn’t have a house and just travels
Eva: I actually use my cook books all the time 

Also Eva: doesn’t know what ginger is
Yes those things ( the crystals and head images) are definitely  bringing demons. Destroy them. Only JESUS chase demons. At the name of JESUS they flee. Philippians 2:9-11 King James Version (KJV) 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.  But very nice house. ☺️
I love thissss
Yes girl you gooo girl 👌💖😁
when you started squeaking the toy my dog went bonkers
I died when she ripped of her wig😂😂😂
'This is not a done painting guys... Don't judge me please.' lmao

Definitely the ZEN DEN
your house is literally MY DREAM house!!! But yours is more amazing than what I'm thinking of my dream house if that makes any sense
GURL DOES THIS HOUSE HAVE AN INSTA?
I NEED NEW MAKE UP IM LIGIT DESPRIT I texted my mom and I took screen shots of her room and told my mom I wanted her room
Dream house!!!!!
okay your living room is not coherent. It is half surfer and half bohemian. AND THAT DEER PILLOW really reeeallly reeeeeeeallly does not fit
She is so aesthetic
Your house gives me life!!!!!
I love your house so much 
So so so much 
It’s my favorite one I’ve seen of all the youtubers
I am so BAD at staying motivated to decorate  but I love it 
I’m also super super SUPER broke
I’m talking like I can’t even spend $20 on something so it’s hard to stay motivated when I can’t make things look nice 
It would take me years to even do a “low low budget” room Reno
This may sound weird but...








Did she get a boob job???????
All of the rooms were my favorite lol
packs bags so i can live with eva
First i thought golden play button in the bathroom doesn't make any sense....but after hearing the explanation ...


That totally makes some sense now!!😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔😅😅
where did you get all those CUTE decorations!
10:50 WiG sNaTcHeD literally
Do a makeup video plsss
SHE'S SURFING?! That's why i love her.
2:25 "This is my front door, it's black like me. 41% to be exact. Actually 42."

Your house is so orginized and pretty! #Obssesed
i aspire to be like mylifeaseva but i have no moneyyyyy
I love the style of your house ❤️

Who the hell poops for 5 minutes
HOLY SCHNITZEL 😱 your house is literally my DREAM HOUSE 😍😍😍😍

Is she Moana in the present world??
You’re so beautifullllll

FBI OPEN UP!!!😂😂 2019 Anyone?
Eva :I lived in balaire 


Me:now this is the story all about how my life got switched turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute just to sit right there to tell you how I became the Prince of balaire. when a couple of guys  were up to no good. Started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in 1 little fight and my mom got scared she said "your moving with your auntie and uncle in balaire "
"Lets name him Larry"

Sees screenshots



Me: Its MF Gary😂😂
I mean...you're neighbor got arrested.., Buttttt, THEM EYE LASHES WERE ON POINT GURL!!! 😂 Sorry I take nothing seriously..
Do you think Larry the maintenance man was undercover & the reason he befriended you, was to look after you?
I love when Eva started talking to her phone. 
Eva: “H-hi FBI agent.” BLOWS KISS
The sad thing is that if Eva does end up finding out, she prolly won’t be able to tell us. 


My conspiracy-
First of all, The neighbor- I think that the neighbor was a decoy for much scarier men. I mean come on, new car parked out every couple weeks, building secured with cameras, a very rich city. I think that this guy was getting set up without knowing it. I think that Honda is his actual car. He got a deal with some bad people that if he moved to that apartment, and every couple weeks got a new cool nice rich car, then he will get something out of it... Maybe money, maybe he needed help with something that was hard to obtain who knows. And they reassured him since he’s in “a rich city”, no one will suspect anything about the cars and it will run smoothly. But these cars were involved in something much bigger: maybe illegal car racing, maybe they were stolen, traded off for something very illegal. And so when they knew someone would eventually report him for his suspicious activity, and eventually get the police involved (maybe they set an anonymous tip to the police) these cars could have been flagged in their police system as associated with illegal activity, so they call the fbi, the fbi would check the tapes and see ALL the cars he “had” and he would get framed for the crimes associated with those cars. But I mean the fbi would probably realize eventually that this guy isn’t some crime lord, and he has no idea where any of the cars go after he returns it to the dude (that he prolly snitched out). 
OR
you said the fbi ended up breaking in, but you never heard him getting arrested. Maybe he was killed and now they are out looking for a guy who isn’t alive, an endless decoy for the real criminals. Maybe they left trails, so the fbi think they catch on to this guy and then they “loose him”.


now this is where the creepy elevator dude who’s his friend comes in- maybe this guy wasn’t his “friend”, maybe he was sent there by the bad people he was dealing with. And when he said hi to you and Meredith it wasn’t just you guys, he said hi to many people in the whole building, knowing that the fbi would question some people and those people would mention the creepy dude who is friends with your neighbor. When they mentioned the creepy guy the fbi go and talk to him, he ends up emitting “fake info” on neighbor dude naming “suspicions” he’s had about him which could go two ways, either get him framed and locked up or.. if he was never arrested stuck looking through loopholes for the guy when he doesn’t even exist and he’s dead.

^^ if anyone read that I am very sorry I am a very creative person, and I was so bothered that I didn’t know what happened that I had to give myself an answer to resolve my internal conflict.
what we really need to talk about is why you so willingly gave up personal information to a creepy guy in an elevator
I thought Brent was Camila cabello  😂😂😂 at 2:57
me:I wonder what happens if I type 0 / 0 in my caculator
types 0/0 in calculator
two seconds later 
FBI OPEN UP
You don’t need to call the police,because the FBI is already there!
“I start hearing wakie talkies beep boop “ best inmpression ever 😂
All I here is like walkie talkies beep boopin' around, 
                               -Eva
What if the guy in the elevator was an FBI agent but was acting that way to see if Eva and her friend were involved with the neighbor.
You can def tell his name was Gary lol
some random sketchy guy approaches her and she tells him her name AND what floor she lives on? Damn girl, you gotta be smarter!
Eva: personally i would be a smart criminal 

Also eva: gives up personal information to creepy lift guy
If something bad happens get UNDER something that you can fit in
Or find something that can keep you safe and hide 


Edit: I will like my own comment because no one will

Ok so I have a reason to think the guy who has a crush on you is named Garry. Coz the text msg screenshot has a G for the pfp and you were thinking for like a short time like "Larry". That's it. That's my reason :)
Honestly the lense clicking made the vid creepy😂😂😂😂😂
You shoud be a Detektiv 😂😘
Do an extreme dare video in different shops xx
Girl don’t tell a random man in the elevator where you live! I would of just said “no I don’t live here just visiting a friend.” Also as his neighbor you should have every right to ask what’s going on because you could have been in danger. I would of straight up asked the apartment management what happened. Also the case could be public record by now. 🤔
Omg can’t u find out what happened, I really wanna now. If u find out later on, please make a video about it 💞😁
OOO YES SIS SHAKE THAT SCRUNCHIE
Eva was in a meme “FBI open up”
15:22 eva, i'm not sure you can be a spy because you said you will love to be a spy and a spy cannot expose their real identity
Plot twist :your neighbour was an alien
Omg you must have been so scared
Story time videos are the best but I also love your other ones. Things that happen to you are like crazyyyyy.

wait is your name eva or ava lol
My life is crazy 🤪
Omg Eva ur so good at these type of things. You should be in a mystery tv show u would be so good lol :)
You are the journalist   EtN
okay so here's the tea! Andrew Stafford, 56, of Bel Air, was the president of Midway Industries, which allegedly scammed businesses and nonprofits through the sale of lightbulbs, sometimes inflating the price by 900 percent. Stafford faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the mail fraud conspiracy and for each count of mail fraud; the indictment lists seven counts. AND THE DATES MATCH UP PERFECTLY! AND he was wanted so that's why the FBI was at his appartment. AND his fraud made him $50 million dollars, so that's were all those expensive cars come from. and btw it also said that he got an old car (umm.. maybe the crusty honda) and he put a sucide note on it and abandoned it in an attempt to throw the investigators off LOOK UP: FBI arrested man in appartment in Bel Air 2016. Anyways thats the tea.

I've woke up at 1:00 in the morning
does anyone else hear this quiet growling in certain parts of the video?
Once this person kept on texting me saying "how old are you?" "Where do you live?" I obviously didn't tell the person because like..... No.... But the person wouldn't stop texting me!! So I finally just answered with "No" I know very creative😂 but then they texted back like the day after saying "If you don't tell me I will find you" I didn't think to much about it because I thought it was a prank (still might be) but then they called me about 5 times EVERY. SINGLE. DAY! For about I don't know like 4 days?? Yeah around 4 days, I finally answered the call and in this like computer type voice they said  i just said  then hung up I haven't gotten a call, text, email or anything from that person again it was probably a prank but it was still a little bit weird.

Who seen Gabi she did a story time about that rented house 🏠
omg Ava why does this crap always happen to you! the plus side is that u have great storytimes! haha :)
bro, these conspiracy theories make so much sense, this shit could b helpful for the fbi, lol ur good at this
I love how she can pay attention to such details
I love love these vids like so she will make more! 💎❤️
I think her neighbor was involved in grand theft auto.
Probably a human trafficker! oooo CREEPY!
How is your life so interesting like all i do is get panic attacks abt school and sleep...
You are not crazy
Omg that was scarry
Larry’s real name is Gary
You just talked
Omg I can't believe that like I hope you are ok
His name was Gary huh? Lmao
My friends neighbor got stabbed 😰😰😰
You should make a story time channel I love your story times btw I love you soooooooooooooooooo much
The camera clicking makes it sound scary
My neighbours got arrested by the FBI and got out somehow and then the detectives broke a fence so the could jump over it but it was only a metre high, lol. And then tghey ended up jumping over it anyways so im confused, but and there was a police chase and the detectives asked us to look out for a blue car. It has a big field behind of it and us all, I was brushing my hair when i looked over and i saw a car, it looked like an olden day black car but then i looked over again and it was a small blue car. I RUN to my mum and tell her and then i told my dad and he rung crime stoppers. After that the FBI, Police, Detectives and security were running around there house found them and then took them to the police station. 2 detectives looked through the blue car and found lots of drugs. Then a tow truck came and took the car. There house now has no power no water or anything. So thats my story.
The camera clicking sounds like the music that plays when somthing scary is about to happen in a movie
That Pokémon shirt man story creeped me out lmfao
I love csi
FBI open up
LOVE THE ARIANA GRANDE GRAY-PURPLE THEMED HAIR YAS GIRL WIG (haha get it)

“beep boop bap boop peep poop”
I HAD TO DO A CSI ASSAY ON THIS ISLAND
This is why Eva escaped the night…;)
FBI open up
THE MATTRESS FIRM MONEY LAUNDERING GOT ME SO MUCHH😂😂😂


Shane Dawson conspiracy theory ?🤔
13:51 I think I found out his name... Gary
please make more story time videos!! i love them sm
i like waching NCIS:
U need Brent to protect ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe Larry is a undercover agent and he was protecting Ava and that’s why she could not tell Ava. And maybe thats why he had a “crush” on her. I just cracked the case y’alll
My neighbor has been arrested like 8 times he was selling drugs
It could be the dobre brothers
25:29 why does the song sound like its saying DUMB EVA
I didn't know that Eva said cause words
"I have bills and a dog please dont unmonetize me youtube" haahha
“I’ll tell you how I became a prince of a town called “Bel Air.”
this video was posted on my 11th birthday. :)
Man in black 👻🖤✌🏻🖤👻
Instagram sent me! I love all your videos
Oh I spelt it wrong it's SWAREING
OMG!!!!!!!   It's so crazy
Beast story Eva
Hi name is Gary I think
Conspiracy theory: 
The FBI were actually fans of ava that heard she was spending the night at that apartment somehow got the number and banged on her door just so they could meet her
Who likes the purple hair look
Sex trafficking????
13:51 bruh that clearly says gary XD
How many times did Eva say "guy  banging on my door"
Realistically it was probably something boring like tax evasion or some other white collar crime 😂
Is FBI comment fake?
wait am i the only one that sees what the building managers real name is from the screen shots??
When did Eva start swearing
I thought she was gonna say the Pokémon shirt guy must have done a background check on every person in the building
if her and brent had a kid it would be Noah Centineo he is like a combo of them LOL
Or maybe they wanted to make sure That u didn’t know anything because U where neighbors with them and was doing shady business and didn’t need snitches. That’s what I would have done 😈
What if the guy who lived next door was actually pranking you bc he know you were a YouTuber and wanted to be on your channel😂
FBI OPEN UP
Left at 6 min get to the point holy cow
Do you see criminal minds it's a crime episode in Netflix
His name was Gary lol it was obvious
#beststorytimeEvaaaaaaaa
Love your videos
Can you not swear because I almost got grounded
In January one of my neighbors stabbed 2 of his roommates and it was 1:00 am and my mom came in my room and was like “lock your windows there was just a stabbing in our apartments” it was terrifying because it was the building over next to us
1:11 the fresh Eva of bell air. Lol
Oh my god 🤨
OMG!!! First time I ever heard Eva swear!!!
OMG STOP SWARING!
Did you ever meet the Fresh Prince of Bel Air?
Are you ok now
This reminds me of blindspot
Although I'm a kid but some dude bangs on my door someone getting kick but this has never happened and I hope it won't 😐😐
we lived in the same area, I'm still here
"personally i would be a smarter criminal than that" 
me: 😂😂😂😂😂
i wish i felt you (kinda not thats terrifying)
that's really scary I would be like mom dad get over here
Love your hair😍
You are awesome and you should do more storie telling
why is her apartment more than my house mortgage
I could sleep through that I can sleep through a tornado 🌪
I could sleep through that I can sleep through a tornado 🌪

The last part about getting in the circle is sooo logical
As soon as she said Bellair.... I'm so sorry but.... This is a storytime all about how Eva's life was switched, turned, upside down and she took 20 minutes to film, so sit right there, she'll tell you all about how, her nieghbor.. got arrested...by the FBI. Ya sorry, I lost it at the end. Lol 😂
FBI has entered the chat
Where is Berlin ??!!
Holy crap as you were talking about the fbi there were sirens near my house

I have bills and a dog to look after, please don’t  demonetise me - Eva Gutowski, 2018 This is why we love a story time with Eva 💖
I do not think you are crazy. I can totally relate.😕😂😄😅😕
I also think those kind of things
This is weird but try it

I'm going to send you a
link that they just sent me.
DON'T open it until you send
it to 10 people. then open it 
and you will see the person
that loves you the most. But 
first you have to send 
it to 10 friends, if you don't,
nothing will show up: It's 
weird.



Who was ur person?
Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air
The camera clicking kinda sounds like scary music😂😂
13:50 is his name Greg Because my enemies name is Greg
Holy crap she was the fresh princa bel air
Nikki and Gabbi!!!
my neighbor got arrested by the fbi toooooo
Lol the maintenance dudes name is Gary I saw lmao

After the Beyoncé thing when she was talking about the cars,I heard a croaking sound.just me?
Who else thought that that weird noise was ur stomach
At 6:32 I actually thought Ava was crying lol
I love Eva so much!
#BestStoryAva🥰
FBI OPEN UP
Really wanna see the stalker video but DAMN GIRL U LIVE A SCARY LIFE.
3:55 "6 AM IN THE MORNING." WTF
Omg  Eva was swearing
This is so interesting. I also love stuff like this; crime, murder, anything like that. And don't worry Eva, you're not crazy. I think the exact same way.
9:05 my dad 😂
And all I hear is Walky talkys beebboopin around 😂😂😂
Love you Ava you are awesome
Was that Niki and Gabi??
tea ☕️
A student at my college was arrested by the FBI for streaming child pornography on the school server. 😂😢
she kinda b lookin like kat dior
I think Larry's real name is Greg
does any one else hear that sound
I lobe ur hair i usually dont like purple but that is sooo cuuttteee!!! I love it
Is it just me or does the beeping that camera did make it super creepy
they should have told you what was up. your safety is important. if there were homemade bombs or drug lab etc next door then you have a very solid right to know!
if you needed to be out of the way of gunfire or something through your walls then they should have warned you.
I secretly love that she keeps saying CSI (which is crime scene investigation) are spies instead of CIA
My teacher told me she had a neighbor that was making a bomb and got arrested lol
.....eva are you ok?
#BESTSTORYEVA💕💜
His name is Gary
His name is Gary

#beststorytimeevery
#beststoryeva (I like that hashtag) 🙃
🤭🤭🤭😟this is soooo scary
Did anyone hear a creaking sounds through out the end of the vid
I swear I heard this story before and I have never watched this video!
I didn't realized the clicking of the lens until you said there was clicking by the lens lol
why would you tell the creepy 35 year old man wearing a pokemon shirt in the elevator your name, AND WHAT FLOOR YOU LIVE IN???
I didn't know you swear but I still love you soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much so please don't come for me 😨😬😰❤️
That's kinda creepy
I’m guessing he sells stolen cars or cars that have been used for sketchy stuff and needed to be gotten rid of
Did anyone else hear the occasional weird squeaky sound after the Beyoncé concert??? No, just me hearing her demon? Great! 😰😰😰😰
his name is Garry
Eva, you're crazy...
None of us take anything seriously so sorry ❤️....
All of these story time videos are the best
Me, knocks on the door very lightly, says really quietly "fbi open up please pretty pretty please"
This is FREAKING CREEPY and I love how I was like OMG YEAH EVA.. OMG WOOOW.. OH NO.. in the last like 3 minutes
You remind me of Lauren diy
We told you not to say anything.
I think the guy that was in the elevator was fbi
It should be called #StoryEva
OMG my grandmas friends son is training to be an agent for the FBI, his name is Shawn

Barav is to cute
For your next video you should prank Brent like stay in his house for 24 hours without him knowing lol
I did that too
Nice moves u got there Brent keep that up and Eva is gonna go with alen stoke

Litterly here’s a list of moves she does to cuddle and  to be with you and u mess it up take your chances dude 

1 she tries to hold your hand
2 she spends a lot of quality time with you to feel closer to u
3 she freaking touches you a lot like she puts her feet on u but a romantic sort of way you know
But one thing you do right is you make her laugh and smile a lot when she is with you keep that goin

But I think alen  is one step closer cause he calls her baby he cuddles with her he touches her gently and romantically if that’s even a word he buys her stuff and is cool with you doing stuff with her which means he trust her with you I’m not telling you to completely change but you know I just don’t want you to lose your girl I love u bro your like my favorite YouTuber keep up the good work and use my tips
U GUYS SHOULD FREAKING DATE
WHY ARE BRENT'S LEGS SO HAIRY
The next challenge they should do is act like a couple for 24 hours
"we're just friends "

ITS FINALLY HERE. You guys dont know (well actually you do, FOUR YEARS) how long ive been wanting to tell all of this to you and i'm so glad Brent did it with me. I want to say, please don't send any hate towards Brent. This all happened 3 years ago when we were younger, and we've had an amazing friendship ever since! I'm in a loving relationship now. We're just talking about our past, not our present :)  GIVE THIS VIDEO A THUMBS UP AND SHARE IT WITH A FRIEND THAT GOT FRIENDZONED AS HARD AS I DID LOL ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ xoxo, Eva
the entire video:
eva: YOU DID
brent: I DIDNT
This is proof that boys deny everything when they’re nervous around their crush
Brent : "She's sitting on the grass, so I sat on the grass. What am I supposed to do, talk to her on the concrete?"
I'm dying 😂

This is pure demonstration of how a girl remembers every single detail when they like someone. Or just in general. And boys... they be boys
Brent is so nervous he didn’t stop touching his hair 😂
I was like awww why doesnt brent know she was almost gonna cry??????? Because i saw Eva was holding back her tears😫😪😥
in conclusion , BOYS ARE CLUELESS.
ok  but who is  this fortune teller GIRL WE NEED A NAME
sis didn’t spill the tea, she threw it
Eva: “You have NO relationship bone in your body!

Brent points to pinky

Brent: Right here! 
🤣🤣🤣
He's pretending not to remember so much because he's BLUSHING 😂😍
Eva: we get into this parking structure go up to the floor above where our cars r and like Brent is going to deny this but we both started crying.

Brent: NOoooooNoooNoNONONONOoooo THAT NEVER HAPPENED   I’m leaving  Bullcrap Bullcrap

2 secs lasted 

Brent: when we were crying 



This just shows how boys will always be boys and they will deny anything but then bring it up later 😂😂😂
Me at the beginning:

OOOH TEA'S ABOUT TO BE SPILLED!!!

Me in the middle:

BRENT WHY CAN'T YOU SEE SHES CRYING!! WHY, BRENT, WHY??!!

Me at the end:
this was deep...

Me also at the end:

So... they're boyfriend and girlfriend???!!!

The rest of the people after reading the last one:
This confirms that when a girl has a crush, she remembers EVERYTHING she did with him.
I never wanna see Brent complain about being single
ok but like ride partners MEANS SOMETHING
ngl I don’t understand how Brent could do something like this. its rlly serious fr fr...I mean he led her on, knowing that it would really hurt her. He pretended not to remember moments that were really special to her. He said he didn’t care if she was with someone else after all their history. And he was never clear whether he liked her or not.
I’ve got popcorn and I’m drinking tea.






Yes. Both types.😉
Literally the difference between girls and guys perspective.
I believe Eva more than Brent :) but i ly both ;DD
Brent: I’m a man, I don’t cry, k! 

Later: .... * starts crying cuz of Eva’s story!! Lol 😆
The “ride partners” thing is real like I get it and I’ve been there😂
But you would be so cute thogether
Eva : breaths

Brent : nO thAt Is noT hOw iT haPpenEd
Omg seriously

Whole Video:
Eva: YOU DID!!!
Brent: NO, I DIDN'T!!
Hats off to her, there's no way I could be his friend after these events lol
Brent hiding his feeling for alot of time 




Straight!
13:48
Eva:WAIT FOR IT

ME: IM WILLING TO WAIT FOR IT! *sings rest of the song*.


/only hamilton fans will understand/
Eva trying to convince Brent that he likes her for 30 minutes straight
Is it just me? Or do I want them to be together?? 💑💏
Love how Brent remembers absolutely nothing 🤣
who is here after finding out they are together
I'm sorry but I always thought Brent is gay. Like all of these are really news to me.
"I wanted like blonde children but like okay... Brent can work." I can't Breathe 😂😂😂😂
im the only one who think that Eva love Brent more than Brent do?(sorry for my english)



yeah i think i am the only one
Eva : I should have kissed you
Brent : oh man
What Brent is really thinking : s**t whyyyyyyyyyy aw s**t. Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, aw s**t  I'm crying
They argue like an old couple
"i don't wanna ruin our friendship" says every guy that you end up actually liking
You know for a fact Eva cried while editing this
Yea i have a question..
You both like eachother
You both dont have the heart to break the friendship
So DATE ALREADY

this made me pretty sad but lowkey if it were me i would lowkey stop being around brent
1st video in which Eva uses profanity
"I've been working my BUTTT off" 😂😂😂I don't know why I'm cracking up😂😂😂
This video is the epitome of the ’it's complicated’ relationship status
i thought homeboy was gay
I think Eva and Brent should date... who agrees?
hey Eva!... you probably wont read this but this would make a good book.. Title option  Almost Never
Hold up are y’all dating or naw?
"No, no , I love it" -brent🤯




2019 ppl!!!
Brent rivera friendzoning eva gutowski for 33 minutes straight
The times Brent got up from his chair are uncountable 😂😂😂
14:39 rip headphone users
I think im deaf
Who remembers Casper & Eva ? 







Only the real OG’s remember
this video is the definition of friend zone
PUBLIC WARNING: EVA GETS TRIGGERED XD
WHAT THE F*%# is wrong with Brent
He loves you Eva 😂 don't worry
Can u guys plz date u guys r so freakin cute together!!!! #breavaforlife
25% storytime
75% Brent fixing his hair
I never told you this Eva but my name is also Eva!
33 minutes of Brent being super uncomfortable
you guys disagree A LOT but its kinda cute :)
I relate to this so much... I had this argument with my best friend crush and we haven't spoken since then so...
"Have a sip of orange juice everytime Brent friendzones eva" 

Me: finishes 5 cartons
hey Eva i have the same problem and i just told her buttt i got friendzoned not fun at all and i wanted to say i know watchu feeling sis 💙
I love how in like the first ten minutes how Brent screams NO
Look to be honest I know they spent 33 minutes explaining they don't have feelings but now how their talking about how they used to feel just sounds like BREVA can be more
He’s a capricorn!! Capricorns be like that
is anyone else scrolling through the comments while watching the video
This whole video is just them arguing
3:35  the hair touch same place and time🤣🤣❤❤
Brent is just always smiling no  like always laughing
I’ll be honest, I love both of you but Eva I feel like you deserve more, someone who treats you the real way you deserve and that can be hard if Brent is so focused on other goals. You can’t force love you know? I want you two to end up together but you gotta take time sometimes. I love how this video had such high energy and and both were so honest. And Brent was straight up lying 😂
eva: breathes 

brent: nO thATs noT HoW It HApPenED
Oof…… scary jk that’s literally me
27:34
Eva you are so loving caring and nice ✌
Eva so likes Brent but then there is Brent who’s just like not having it
This is how many times Brent tried fixing his hair

⬇️
Anything Eva says 
Brent: "NOOOO"
plz get together me and my friend are praying that you two get together GET THE FRIK TOGETHER
Wow can I order one cute best guy friend PLS thanks and then maybe I'd marry him or sums idk , three thousand likes and I'll marry the future cute best guy friend I don't have
Girls never forget 😘
Why does he keep lying you know he likes Eva
Brent rivera denying the truth for 33 minutes straight
I relate to this so much. When I had a crush on this guy I remember EVERYTHING we did even if it was insignificant
this was the first ever video i watched of eva and tbh she didn't have the best first impression on me from this video. but i've kept watching her videos and she's one of my favorite youtubers! I SHIP BREVAAAAAAA
eva: 3 AM
brent: * 11:40 pm *
Oh my god😥😪 this made me cry❗️😥❤️
Eva- confronting my crush 
3 days later
Brent- 5 signs a boy doesn’t like you FT Eva
20:46
Team Eva or team Brent

Every time Eva said she was sad 
Eva:and I was crying...
Brent:awwww 😢😢
THANKU EVA this video made me feel normal

Wow, I just drank the whole pot of tea 🍵
Brent:when was this?
Eva:why do u care!? 😂
Brent dont look this sad the whole video 😭
Came back to watch this video since they got together now 😂
The intensivity of this video 


Like damn

❤️😭😏😥😣😮💞
Somebody isn’t ready to confront his own feelingsss cough cough Brent
This is my relationship with 1 of my freinds.
# BREVA for LIFE
So it's like they both really love each other but their friendship is more important, they don't want to take any risk on there friendship. I was really crying frm inside after I saw their story it was like they love each other but unfortunately they cant fall in relationship nd they have to face the reality. Still I just want to say that Eva should be positive coz one day they might date each other 😍💕💕💕
Eva: I wanted blonde children, but Brent can work

Me: yooooooo! Its happening!

Also what if they are secretly dating?
How is Brent and eva single they are good looking and kind bruhhh  



Whattt
I love how Brent disregards everything in this video but the video on his channel, he tells the same stories
Brent : I didn't cry I'm a man.
First off all a real man can admit stuff witch he clearly can't , also a real man would NEVER lead someone on just saying
i remeber when I first watched this i was thinking...


if this is the most awkward video ever idk what is..
Brent is every clueless dude EVERRRRRRRRRR
RIDE👏PARTNERS👏ARE👏A👏THING👏
Dont worry I'm crying too ..... I pocked my eye with my mascara
OMG! Just kiss! We all know you want that!!!! Just come together and f*!#$ be happy!






The more i watch this i get more and more mad about this. . .
I gave this video a thumbs up because we ALL have been someone’s unnoticed ride partner 🙃
You guys should do a lie detector test on each other and ask about those things you guys were saying in this vid!!!! It would be so cool!!! #breva. Like if you agree
#Breva 


complicated I feel bad for eva
Honestly I wish you guys were together! ❤️ You would be and are so cute together 😭😉💞😍😏
The way Brent looked at Eva when he apologized
I SHIP I LOVE YOU TWO TOGETHER!!!!
not trying to be nosy but im so sorry the looser guy hurt you but how
You guys would be the cutest couple EVER❤️❤️😘💕 Like if you agree
I litteraly all the videos that i saw today, Brent is with the same shirt. why??
Brent Rivera trying to explain himself for 33 minutes straight
woah wait the fortune teller stuff actually came true though cause now like three years later or something they're probably actually dating now
Here’s a sumerizarion if this video

Ava: I remember this and it happened I have recipes and you did this 

Brent:.... i did not
and now they are dating :)
"no ones gonna like this vid!" 
huh... I guess your wrong brent
watching Eva get friend zoned for 30 minutes straight
I want you two to be a thing so badddddd
OMG I LOVE BREVA and your videos
take a shot every time brent tries to lie about something that happened
You guys are giving me Ross and Rachel vibes😂😂😂#he is her lobster(fortune teller) datee u guys🤗
Anyone else just scrolling through the comments because they can’t stand the awkwardness of the video😂
How do you know if someone is flirting with you and how do you know if someone likes you?
They themselves look so confused
Just count how many times Brent says aw
Your  crush is Brent💙💜!!!!!!!!!
Eva girl I don’t blame you. He is hella cute
Brent, a TYPICAL BOY. Eva a TYPICAL GIRL.
Breva proved the pshycoligist WRONG
At least you get with your crush 

I know my crush since I was born and he don’t like me
This Video:
Eva getting friend zoned for thirty minutes
Brent having the memory of a goldfish for thirty minutes
How did I miss 2 years worth of this tea
I literally liked the video cause Eva mentioned about the ride partners thing
Breva for life just kiss each other already.
TBH I think that Brent should and most likely does have feelings for Eva! But is keeping them in a package💝 📦
You should do most of your videos with Brent👍😊
Eva is doing what every girl has always wanted to do. We’ve always wanted to sit a boy down and tell them everything they did wrong to us😂😂😂
Real just randomly comes into the vid like Brent......................……….......







YOU TRIED TO FARB HER HAND!!😂😂😂
Omg I love y’all and I ship
When ur 21 but ur voice is still not past 14 yr old puberty
Brent was clearly trying to cover up... XD
“Brent Rivera LYING for 33 minutes straight”😂😂😍
Manz got memoryyy problemo😂😂
OMFG BRENT REMINDS ME OF ADRIEN!! WHY?! "As A FrIeNd."
Okay Brent is actually a really good liar 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY!!! HE APOLOGIZED REPETEDLY!! That is so special, boys don't normally do that. This ones a keeper Eva!
I can’t stop laughing 😂😂😂
How Eva remembered so clearly and Brent was clueless the whole time 😂
Watching her get friend zoned for 30 minutes was sadder then me getting friend zoned 🤣
shipping them- Event
21:36 teala you go girl!! #breva
don't  say. awwwww I feel bad for u
"I....I don't remember that part.." 
Brent denying everything during the video 😂😂
Anyone here after exposing our relationship video 2019?
totally agree with the ride partner thing
my ride partner asked me out THEN BROKE MY HEART...lol
There’s multiple points in this video when she leans and stretches her arms out to hug him and the video just immediately cuts off😂
So Eva got curved by Brent and that’s the tea
Rip headphone users!!
This feels like a very long "we were on a break"
2% story time
98% brent and Eva flirting ❤️❤️


 forever ❤️💜💜❤️💜❤️💜🤓🤓💜🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤭🤭🤭

WOW!!! what an interesting conversation!!! Why you boys are always soooo ambiguous??? We girls try to analyze the meaning of your words or your acts but it's absolutely impossible to guess what the hell you're really thinking or feeling. OMG!!! 🤦‍♀️
Brent denying everything Eva says for 30 minutes

"RIDE PARTNERS MEAN A LOT BRENT"
This hurt to watch just because it ruined my ship
I dare you to date Brent on camera😁😀
By the time Brent realizes he wants Eva, she’d have moved on. It’s a matter of time 💔
I've been though the same thing and your really cool
This literally just shows how much girls care about every single little detail that happens with a guy
Please just get together, it would be perfect 😍😍😍

if I had a penny for every time he friendzoned Eva, I'd be rich
Best youtube video ever!
Brent and Eva just admit that you love each other
THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME
Always couples start by saying we are just friends.❤
“Brent,  you’re looking real shady here” 😂😂😂
Idk why butt I really ship u guys
O m g pause the video and see 16:08  😂😂😂
U r the BEST Eva 😘
Brent admit it you like her
I love your hair.
Eva Eva can I please have  shoutout
Why aren’t you dating now
Ava my heart goes out to you, Gurl there is no point worrying about some guy if you know he is just going to hurt you again, you will find someone perfect, you don't need to look verry hard love will find you when it's readdy. I agree boys suck. and this is something my cousin tought me, if you really love someone or don't want to luse them just don't act like it bothers you when he or she texts someone else or goes on a date with someone else. It only makes him think that you are going to be to protective as a girlfriend and it will push him away. But obviously if you are alreaddy dating someone then it is not ok if he is texting someone else. And remind yourself your a person too and you don't deserve that.❤❤❤❤
The amount of times Brent says “NO” and “WHAAAT” in this video😂
Will you get together
I ship you guys
This is so relateable
366k have ride partners Brent
This is solid proof that women have better memory than men 😂😂
Lol you know us females remember EVERY SINGLE THING

14:53 I CAN’T LMAO THIS FACE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

THEY SAID THAT ARGUMENT WAS AT THE MALL IN THE OTHER VIDEO, IN THIS VIDEO THEY ARE SAYING IT WAS AT DISNEY
IMCONFUSEDDDDDD
Are you guys together in 2019?
Yup u left some informaion 
In my brain: wat are you talking about
Omg Eva started blushing
it's crazy how some moments can mean so much to one person and the exact same moment could mean so little to the other person that they completely forget it even ever happened
Guys this is the best story I heard love you the both 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Can we just acknowledge Ava’s AMAZING freaking makeup
Omg plsss just get together pls everybody is shipping Breva plsssss
My ship has sailed!!!!
Brent tryna finesse his way outta this situation for 33 minutes ☠️😂
You guys are probs secretly dating

eva do you still like brent
*eva says anything*
brent: AS FRIENDS
Do you play Minecraft
Do you secretly still like each othee
Liza and David !!!! Video !!!😍😍😍
There's something that's going on with me and its really weird because there's this guy but he's currently in a relationship with my best friend and she doesn't know that I've liked him for a while now but I asked him if he liked me and he said no but he lied because I know he likes me. In class he looks at me, just like stares at me and if I catch him he looks away and then just looks back. I really don't know what's going on... I don't want my best friend to get mad at me, because we've been friends for a very long time and I don't want it to ruin my friendship with my best friend. So, yeah...
Brent is missing out
Like if u agree
Why is brent so rude?
He just dont want eva to like him
2:22
Brent: are we recreating the Liza and David video.

Me: sobs in gucci 








Answer: Laura Lee Apology Video

Me actually: just sobs while wishing that they got back together and that Brent and Eva were dating
Soooo... Are you together???
Ooooooh Breva!😙❤😉
awe when she lowkey started tearing up and wiped them away before brent noticed ahhhh, she really just showed how emotional girls can be
cutest couple ever 😚☺️😘😊🤗
When Brent realizes he is confused
'your gonna find an amazing girl one day
-and its not going to be me' ahaha ok eva
They're so cute ❤
I hate that he denys everything. This video makes me mad. She is hiding her emotions she wants to cry but is keeping a smile and laughing. I feel bad for her.
Ship this so hard🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
I think they will be a good couple one day
1:57 OMG THATS IS SOOO ME WHEN I SEE MY CRUSH
Omg I loved this
Plot twist:The fortune teller was paid by Brent.
Y0l will look so good together
These guys are the cutest ever...just date😭😭
Dude I had a ride partner at six flags!
I literally felt Eva’s frustration throughout the whole video 😂
Wait you guy cuss??? Lol I did not know that!!! 😂 😆 😝
But you 2 would make such a cute cupel!😭😭!! I love you guys so much and hope you have a nice relationship as friends!😘
Re-liked the video because of the ride partner thing
You two are a perfect couple
This video should be called brent denying everyting eva says😂😂
Won’t be ready for 3 years hmm? It’s 2019; the 3 years is up.
He is a example of a toxic boy.
video starts at 2:18
30:40 proof 🤷‍♀️
Who came to the comments just to see what happened
17:31 I can relate Brent, I LITERALLY don't remember ANYTHING most of the time
brent was playing her !! for sure . now i understand why they aren't a couple.
this whole video is a series of brent & eva denting that they like each other lol. just date already 🥵🥵
I'm not buying anything Brent was saying!!!
I don’t know if Brent realizes how damn hung up girls get on guys
I still ship them
#Breva I ship them lol
My brother used to work at McCormick and Schmicks lmao
“I should of kissed you” and he said he regretted it Ofp ouch lol love you guys 😍😅😅
Brent rejects his feelings.
WHICH FORTUNE TELLER!! Im near seattle!
Your still flirting😘😂😍😊😅
Your hair is so pretty
22:50 August 23 is my bday aww ♥️🦄
I feel so bad for Eva she srsly got played
Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silvestein is one of my favorite poetry books. Glad to see that Brent has some taste XD
Guys are literally clueless 😂😂😂
Yesss, ride partners!!!!
...One more year to go...
I’m confused on how he doesn’t remember anything .. it’s funny how girls can remember like every detail and guys can see it a different way.
Eva’s getting so hurt 😭😭😭
Boys are so stupid when they are crushing on a girl!😂😮
thirty three minutes and thirty six seconds of Eva exposing Brent
watching this now I was like no its KOA but they're  just friends so I guess not.
No wonder he posted , 5 signs a boy doesn’t like you...
Awww ride partner 😭😭
31:51 The cutest thing I have ever seen on YouTube 😭💕
It's the same kind of with my best friend
"I remember a lot of things. I write a lot." me
Brent denying everything for 30  mins straight....i feel so awkvard for him..
are you and Brent dating
Your profile picture is kind of the same
IM 13 not 14 tho 😭
I've been someone's ride partner!!😕
this just shows the difference on how much girls think about there crush and how much guys think about there crush!
Eva just remembered everything
Come on you guys are perfect for each other
I watched this when it first came out but this video made me dislike brent❕
I don’t know why but I want what Ava and Brent have😂😂
lowkey ride partners matters.... like when Lara Jean didn't sit next to Peter Kavinsky :'( lol #unrelated
OMG I WANT BREVA TO HAPPEN SO BAD
i think u should be couple
Sorry brent but I would be slapped you
The gaslighting is too real wowww
BRENT IS JUST SCARED OF COMMITMENT
MyLifeAsEva’s YouTube Channel Photo Is The Same Pose As Brent
You should merry each other
oh my god is that true
They're so cute together!
Brent im sorry but you cannot talk yourself out of that "i should have kissed you" text. Nice try though it was cute
Omg the way Brent looks at Eva the whole way through is proof that #breva is still alive!
So... this has been bugging me since I looked at it. Did anyone else notice that in Eva’s comment she wrote a “four” instead of a “for”?






P.S(I LOVE YOU EVA!!!🥰❤️) 
Did anyone else watch this in 2019?
That's a lot of drama🤦
Beneath all of the giggles, Eva is crying.
INTERNAL SCREAMING
A girl remembers everything!!!
The Brava prophecy!!!
I ship 😚😳
          Eva Brent
Poor Eva she just got rejected for 32 minutes straight....😕😂
She lost me at fortune teller. That is how we and they differ about life stuff
31:12 

Brent: “I would be happy to make out with you if we had and idea”

Hey Eva and Brent I have and idea and I think we all know what it is....but if you don’t know...................since Brent was so happy 😀  .....................................................MAKE OUT!!!!!!!
Wait so are u dating???
Brent your like Kendall Jenner like if you wanted to experience things you would experienced the experience. 🙄🤣
The whole video--Brent: “WHAT?!”
Nice guys are usually very oblivious, you guys are adorable
Oh NO he would not be my crush he's such a player
You see Eva you were meant to be with Brent
Thank u for being strong for the YouTube videos and me
RIDE PARTNERS ARE SO IMPORTANTE

"U were crying cuz I was texting another girl"...I swear boys don't know what it's like to like someone cuz they just don't understand every little thing they say or do means so much and can also hurt ppl
Sounds like a painful relationship. I would have ended it long ago... :/

But what about the time u both kissed
Eva- **says something brent did**Brent- What? nOoOoO that NEVER HAPPENEND
Brent you need to date Eva already
Ok...... so Eva is like does this make u feel weird?
brent no I LOVE it
BOIIIIIIIIIII #BREVA
Ride partners are important trust me I have one!! #Breva
Eva clearly wanted to slap him this entire video😂
I like a person 

My ride partner was great
Woah okay. I got the roles so reversed I thought that Eva didn't like Brent that way
I love her voice for Brent when he says I want to start an airplane buisness
There were so into their hair😂😂😂
sips tea
gulps tea 
gUrGl3s tea
CHOKES ON STEAMING HOT TEA
Basically Brent was just trying to fix his hair😆😆😆 lol. Ooooooo
Wow I love this ❤️
"Aww"
whyyyy😭😭😭😢
There is no way that Brent didn't remember everything that Ava was saying. When a girl likes someone they remember every little detail about the time they spend together or how their crush made them feel. The fact that Ava made this video and did not completely freak out on Brent is insane, and the fact that she is still friends with him is even crazier. That just shows she cares about him so much.
just date him, you two are sooo cute tog etherr!
Man I really felt this😂 and experienced this over the summer
Lol 1:57 😂😂
Oof me Eva
Girl I’m sorry he don’t like you like that 🙈😭
Are u 2 together?
Brent keeps putting Eva in the friends zone
WHAT????🤔🤔
They obviously like each other
stop our suffering and DATE already
As a friend jeez Bret ur so mean 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So they r just friends?!?
I truly believe that he doesnt like her the way she likes him. It's a shame because they would be cute,  eva you need to move on babe!
Brent: “ for a Instagram video... I would be happy to make out with you”               That made my day
Who else could tell Eva was about to cry?
Longest.  
Vid
Ever
Pore Brent is freaking me out!!!
It’s true, I have a ride partner
SORRY TO BREAK THE SERIOUSNESS BUT I RECITED THE POEM SICK IN 3RD GRADE WTF
"I wanted like blonde children but like okay, Brent can work." I WAS DYING!
This was same i am like brent becuz i am scared to ya know confront
MAN BRENT GOT THE BEAT DOWN
I played before
You guys should date
“I wanted blonde children but, okay Brent can work” omg I am dead 😂😂😩☠️
Awwwwwww I love you guys ❤️❤️❤️
is it just me or is brent's smile just so cute?
If I was best friends with Brent I'd be in love with him forever it's just how it would have to be oopsie
I think Brent might be Dory
Eva: you’re alive 
Brent: THATS NOT TRUE
Who else cringed throughout the video
I want to like the video because of how u spilled some tea..... but I want to dislike because of how I said that Brent will find a lovely girl and that It won’t be u breaks my heart the I won’t see some breva baby
HUG HER YOU GUYS ARE PERFECT
I agree with eva
Eva wanted everything to be romantic so bad😂 and watching Brent reject any romantic feelings for her every time is just too much
That is amazing
when Brent rubbed his eyeball he reminded me of Miranda Sings.
when he trying to talk himself out of the situation but he know he can't bc the proof is already there
This video confused me so much 😂
brent's "WHAAAAT?? NOOOOO." count: 123456700000000000000000000
Who went straight to the comments for the ship
28:46 "I like you as a friend" oooooo that’s one way to break a girl heart but I still ship
eva's face was great throughout the vid
are u dating
Brent is the kind of person that accidentally flirts with somedbodyy







Edit: I didn’t expect that many likes and btw if Eva or Brent are reading this ily guys
I SHIP IT lol
27:34 Woah there eva
The pic at the beginning is so adorbs
Stop swearing plz brava
Why is it then men NEVER remember anything? We are always right but they continue to deny?! 😂😂👏💜
BRENT AND EVA KISS HAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
A mess. Brent is a mess. Brent is me.

teala backing up eva was the best thing ever (edit: EVA LIKED)
I lost my ride partner when I went on the first ride :(
Omg ur meant to be

Woah! Chill Eva
when a girl likes you she remembers every little thing because even the little things matters
I still ship #BREVA ❤️😂😍
As A FrIeNd 😭😭😭😭
#breva
I've never been to a park IN MY WHOLE LIFE cuz of my mom, so no I don't know how the ride partners work 😤😒
I love how Brent literally denies every single thing she says
Date each other all ready
can the 2 of you become official because you guys are so cute together
10:50 his face though
So your dating bc this confirms nothing
And ladies and gentlemen here’s the difference between girls and guys when it comes to relationships
🤙🏼❤️🍕😍🥰😘🤩🥳🤪
Everyone go to 22:02 on the video 
Brent says “I get my self into some serious holes!!!!!!!”
Is that not dirty?????? LOL 😂
This legit is my life  :'(
I need more videos like that
This video is giving me second hand embarrassment 
Girl wyd
this is so rough to watch oh my goodness
Wow I have no idea what was going on
I know this is so random but, what nail polish are you wearing? It looks so good on you!
Ok to me it looks like that Brent doesn't see how much ava likes him and ava is giving him so many hints and HE WONT CATCH ON lol 😂😂😂 anyway thay would be the cutest couple on the internet 100% cutest couple on the internet if they got together REPLY RO THIS AND MAKE THEM A SHIP NAME LOL even though they are not together (wow this is long lol) BYEE
for a guy who isn’t ready to date he really played her hard🤦🏽‍♀️
I know he was lying now because I've watched 'Exposing Our Relationship' On Brent's Channel... It just took him awhile to admit it.
She remembers everything!
Aww they are so cute together
Ride partners are important‼️
sips tea

You need to watch your profanity. But otherwise ur good
"august 23 24?" my bdayyyy

Breva forever
Eva:*breathes*
Brent: WHAAAAAAT? THAT DIDNT HAPPEN

Edit: OMG 396 LIKES!! Thank you so much
Did anyone else see Brent smile when Eva said me and Brent are flerting...yessss
Or he could it review-Air
my best friend is devastated about Brent and Eva and I’m like ”BE HAPPY” and she like ”my manz has abandoned me” ...
CARMA HE WAS NEVER YOUR MANZ IN THE FIRST PLACE 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
My ride partner is always my ride partner then he left meee for another girl

WELCOME TO THE COMMENTS UR SAFE IN HERE!
EVA I DID THE RESEARCH I KNOW THE STORY

one day back in 1993 and big family moved in and the grandma lost her job as a tailor and moved in with the family.  most of the time rocking in her dear rocking chair sewing or blankly staring at nothing.  they had 9 kids and then they decided to give the kids room the the grandma and let the kids have the attic for their room one day after the grandma kissed the kids goodnight she didnt lock the attic door and there was an EVIL old lady buried under the house she came in and killed the grand ma and entered the attics and killed the kids one by one but the parents weren't killed and rested in piece but the kids and grandmas bodies were never found but every night the kids play and the grandma sits quietly sewing and staring blankly at the kids while they play IN THE ATTIC. And as for the plank the youngest kid made a good luck  charm for her and her oldest sister and when the dead lady killed them their lives got sucked into the plank they both had black hair the oldest one had a burnt face due to cooking accidents and her youngest sister decided not to draw it and as for the plank there were twins that were blonde and one day they went to a German restaurant and they drew a picture together the  dark skies ment that the time they were born at the devil hour (3am)  and the cat sound were the cat of the grandma was watching as they got killed and was kicked in torture by the dead lady and for the dog staring at the window the kids would stare at the bed of their parents (in ur room Ava and the parents got killed 13 days after the kids) so that ment the dog was looking at a reflection behind him and then he would see the ghosts on the wall and stare for hours on end 


THATS MY THEORY MOST OF IT RESEARCH



P.s. one like = five hundred prayers for eva

Little Storytime of my interactions with ghosts!

So a couple years ago, my family moved to our new house. I thought it was very creepy. (My house was a HUGE fixer upper and took three months to make it look good) There was bullet holes in the basement walls, weird stains on the bathroom floor, and dog scratches on some of the doors. My room is upstairs. Which when you go upstairs in my house, it's literally my room. One night I couldn't go to sleep. (When I can't sleep at night, I walk around downstairs. Idk why but I do.) When I got to the bottom of my stairs, I saw this blue and white figure. It was a girl that looked about my age (at that time). The outline of her was blue. And she was all white. She had this nightgown on and she was smiling. It was a friendly smile too btw. And I stared at her for like ten seconds. Then I blinked and rubbed my eyes. And she was gone. So yeah. Hope this story made sense.
well as a christian i personally think it was just demons in the house. why this keeps happening to you idk but people can open doors to the spirit realm through certain things. you might just be very sensitive to spirits. my mom is very sensitive to that kinda stuff. just please be careful about reaching out to mediums and trying to make contact with spirits. love u and praying for u! 💜🙏🏼

Is it weird that I sometimes have visions in my sleep to then the next day wat I seen happens
When I saw this I can hear footsteps in my kitchen and I’m home alone in my room. Someone was sneaking around and the. The door went bang! And then me and my dog went to see and all of the stuff in the kitchen was moved sjnsjs
Who else is hiding in the comments and isn’t full screen?
Right as I clicked into this video, my room light, TV, and phone turned off
And move in with Brent :D
I have a theory... You said Spanish fork main street both brothers Spanish fork (Utah) is a small county that has a main street that could be a place the children loved or a place their parents were. Because I have a theory on the kids' parents. An old lady with 7 KIDS that's sketchy so maybe they were her foster, adoptive or grandchildren. There could have been an orphanage that they were at or the kids visited often. They could have possibly lived there because there's a high school, elementary, and a water park (along with other things). Their parents could have died and they were sent to live with their grandma and grandpa. Both brothers the grandma could have had 2 boys that grew up and had her 7 grandchildren. but they could have died together or were murdered but had separate cases. like a statement that could have been made about their case (the dad's case meaning 2 dads) ..." both of the murder victims were brothers, both brothers". on a separate note the attic... I have a feeling the grandpa was abusive or they both were but maybe that wasn't the case. I have a feeling the grandpa was because you'ed only see 7 children and a grandma no parents or grandpa. Maybe he died, the grandma died and the children were like 7 to 3 and they couldn't take care of them selfs. or the grandpa killed the grandma and locked the kids in the attic or the kids locked themselves in the attic. And I forgot about the moms... they probably died, were killed or maybe died of childbirth so that the dads became abusive and were sent to prison. this is just my theory nothing is factual. Just saying there is like a 0% chance that this could be how things were.
4:00 am is devils and angels hour (means: they fight )
Don''t worry guys I contacted Shane
Wana hear a horror story?





No..
This ill be my safe place.
If anyone wants to hide they can ^^
This is the Residentxclan xD

Edit:....nvm...ill hide in another comment section..
Now I really love sharing a room with my older sister. Because I don't think that  Ghostbusters  are  going to answer my call at 4 in the morning. Also I sometimes hear stuff from my attic but my house is only like 10 or 11 years old. But then I just realize that it's just birds.  

Also now I shall probably have a telephone with 911 on speed dial
This story is soo intense  I get visions too sometimes at night of the most scary things😖😓😟
you should do a collab w shane dawson and figure out what’s happening
This is the only ghost story on YouTube that is NOT clickbait,thank you Eva!!
0:38 DID YALL SEE THE SHADOW MOVE!?!? (Look at the door)
For every like I will put a 😱 
Ok?





😱
It means I killed both of the brothers in Main Street with a fork a 3pm
CALL SHANE DAWSON
Promblem solved! Move in with Brent!♥️
I also can't stand being awake during the 2:30-4:30am time period cos it just freaks me out!
Who else?😑
Whenever I try to make a Tik Tok with my cat, he stares at the door and all that has on it is like a times tables poster...
Dear go please protect me from the underworld 
Amen
😂😭❤️
I feel uncomfortable can I have a like....😰🤨(this is freaking me out!!!)
It sounds like ur saying “Ava” not “Eva”
For every likes il put a 😇 to take care of Eva 
😇
Ok so...
 Conspiracy theory.
So when Adam was there, Eva was relatively safe. Yeah, scary shit happened, but nothing as bad as when she was alone. Maybe...maybe when Adam got into a bad state of mind and Eva and him broke up, maybe that was the...otherworldly force tearing away Eva’s protector in a way. Maybe Adam was the only one who could save her or help her, and the forces or other spirits grabbed him into their world, therefore leaving Eva alone. Maybe Adam knew what was going on the whole time. And he was trying to warn her but knew that the other...things would kill him if he told anybody. So he distanced himself. Idk...
Just a theory.
not fun fact:

84% of the times that you wake up in the middle of the night it’s because something has been watching you for a very long time
One like = one prayer for Eva
Ahhh oh my gosh so I am at sonic and I look over and there’s a little red dot holding a crayon😣
My grandma is praying for you Eva and when I finish this comment I will go pray for you and I wish you the best of luck
maybe whatever was messing with you ... Was using your energy to make these things happen . And when your alone it probably thinks your gonna try to "investigate" which only would give it more energy which was probably it's goal . ~ KayRae
Girl don't mess with mediums and the demonic. Literally whenever you have a scary experience like that, say "Jesus" and watch what happens.
Holy schnitzel
Seeing as you go to church, I would definitely get your house blessed so that demons and stuff don’t haunt your house 😳🥺😖
Mr boogie😂😂
0:38 someone is moving in the background
Can Shane Dawson make a series about all of your paranormal activities? Like with proffesional people and all of this ...... IT WOULD BE AMAZING PLAESE
Go make a video with Hailey Reese and Loey!
I got really scared for you I don't no why because that happened to my friend
Hey Eva you should tell the story in which your house gets broken into! Like so she can see this because I'M SO CURIOUS!!!!!
Eva the reason that paranormal occurrences happened while you were alone was because spirits feast upon vulnerability. When another human energy is with the followed subject it makes it harder to focus upon you/ a person. Your visions are a form of target, the spirit manifests upon your sleep and shows you it’s old scenery. So the reason you had the visions was the spirit showing you what you’re supposed to be afraid of. The reason the plank kept moving was because that is were it could’ve been drawn in the first place. The reason that you felt so many creepy/dense feelings was because the spirit is supposed to make you feel insafe. Usually spirits show you all the reasons you need to get out. If you interrupt these spirits it could be fatal. They want their own space, because they died in that space, or it was close to them. But there’s some information on your old house. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
In my house sometimes at night, we hear squeaking in our attic. Some of my family think it is just squirrel. Me, I  personally think it's something else because when we first moved into the house I looked out the window and saw a black big stubstace. Just standing there staring at me. Ever since then, I get scared at night.( No one believes me but my granny.)
 My granny knows a lot about paranormal activity.) Now I have these nightmares about being  trapped and something happens to me.


Idk. Anyone knows what's going on???
Eva: the background is black cos we getting creepy on this channel
Me:🤔 why are u wearing red
😂😂😂
Dogs can sense goasts...
My attic is right in my room ...if this happened I would die..
Girl you just need to build your own house😂
As I watched this video my lights were turning on and off when I turned the video off creepy things happened and then my tv just off I have always been interested in creepy things and creepy people everywhere is creepy now my cats tail goes huge and she makes sounds like something is killing her and my dog is not even in the room then my dog runs into the room gets in front of me and starts acting like every one in the word is dieing
And it takes a lot to scare me
Your house used to be a haunted theater 🎭
HOLY WATER
You should be on the Scariest Night Of My Life show!!

Air quotes “cause I care about my cat so much”
Short horror story: 
Monday...
15:00 maybe that’s what the footsteps were🤔🤣😜
Two words.... SHANE. DAWSON.
when you woke up and heard footsteps i think it was the "kids" playing
LITERLY MY LIFE IS DEMONS VERY SINGLE NIGHT
brent should be ur roommate he will protect you
Damn she has 128 messages. I dont even have one. 😂😂

Yassss I def believe you and you NEED to do a part 4!!! Don't leave us hanging.
I
Am
Watching 
This
At
Night
I reallyyyy want part 4 like so badlyyy
what if your dog was barking at the old lady because it knew she was a bad person and happened to be the grandma of those children and she used to lock them up in the attic for most of the time (the footsteps you heard would be the children playing)😱😱
People say that if you wake up at 2-3 am, there is an 80% chance that someone/ something is watching you. 

💙💙 Have a good day 💙💙
Edit: It happens to me a lot, at least 4 times weekly.
Honalai is kinda like Paris?
(Go back to part 1 too see)
(IDK how to spell your dogs name sorry)
😔
The background is so creepy Aaaaaaaaaaahh😭😭

Just to take your mind of scary stuff
Pause and go to 2:17
Just live with Brent 😫💞
I always hear my parents talking in the next room but their actually asleep
Collab with Gabbie Hannah the ghosts might be friends
You should just move in a church at this point
Legit I had an attic ish next to my room and one day I was hearing sounds at like 4 in the morning and yelled shut up my family are deep sleepers same with me but anyway and the sounds stop and I heard giggling I told my mum and we moved to a new house cuz we believe in demons,ghosts, and etc it was like 3 years ago omg girl u might have moved into a new house or not but like sage it like ur life depends on it and all that stuff and like pleaseeeeeeeeeee PLEASEEEEEEE stay safe we love u ask the people who disliked are people who don’t understand/ got to scared anyway love u gurl be safe(don’t mind my grammar or spelling mistakes)
It sounds like ur saying “Ava” not “Eva”
Who else thinks that Eva looks like a criminal with the orange shirt and the black background. Also anyone else here 2019?
News I found- SPANISH FORK, Utah, Aug. 27, 2018 — UHP troopers were called to the scene of a fatal accident on Interstate 15 near State Route 164 Sunday.

A Utah Highway Patrol news release said the accident happened when a blue Toyota Tacoma was making a left turn to go south on I-15 from SR-164 westbound at about 2:41 p.m.
Do a video with "ThePsyhicTwins"
Like this so Eva would see it
WHY DID I WATCH THIS RIGHT BEFORE BED
why was this scary video published on my birthday
9:40 dude, yes I feel u.
Staph with da scary music I am scared
Omg Ava looks so creepy in parts of this video her ring light is littlerally like right in the middle of her eyeballs it so freaking creeepy
Watching this before beddd 😎
Wow I never knew people would actually die for ava
What you need-






Cameras
Tell Shane and Garrett and let them find out what's in your attic
Woah... made the mistake of watching this at 11 PM
Can we just take the time to acknowledge that she has 177 unread text messages
That sounds really scary 😱😈
Oh wow. Eva I hope that you can get through this. 😌
Also you and Shane need collab and talk about paranormal experiences and like have a 3 part series where you guys visit those houses or places and investigate and like come to a conclusion about what happened in the those places to make it haunted in the finale
11:53 dude, you may have been listening to a satanic cult or some kind of black magic meeting because they usually do animal sacrifices with things such as cats. In fact I think cats are the most common
I love your long story vids please mame more

Eva: ...and the second attic was above my bedroom
Me and my sister watching this: ...
Collab with Shane Dawson about ghosts, or the psychic
I've been moveing my house's a lot and once i was liveing in Sarajevo next to the old old hospital. Hospital was shut down long time ago and once I saw an ambulance car going out of the hospital and the scariest part of this is that my room was watching at the fu*cking hospital. And I have lived there for 3 years and last month there i saw LITTLE GIRL ON TOP OF THE HOSPITAL JUMPING OF THE ROOF.
Everyone come to the comments, you are all safe here 😂
You wanna know something scary....





....My WiFi went out
i love you but CRAY-ON
sleep has left the chat
If you ever light a candle, then it blows out, no breeze, you are in the presence of paranormal activity.

Ok well I'm done🧘🤸‍♀️🚴‍♀️🏊‍♀️🙏

Alexa, play despacito.
Did you know that when you wake up in the middle of the night ... you would wake up because your body feels like somebody watching you ...
“The finally, the final count down...”
Haha don’t jinx yourself😂
I have had a adick for all my life which is 10 years
My mom is like you she gets drawn to Serrano areas and spirits tend to show her that they are there but they are always good spirits and she never feels scared.

Girl. You mad psychic. You might def be a medium. 
If you feel fear, tell them to leave strongly. If not, try talking to them lol.
My scary story...




I had two bars of wifi!:O
girl, that could possibly your landlord playing tricks on you..
maybe he knew that she'll break the leash and have to pay for the rest of the months even without living.
that's how people trick on you for their benefit..
Sorry I had to come back to this video and ask u when are u going to post part 3 😂
I got three words for you Eva.   
MOVE. OUT. NOW
I love when you do story time!!!!!!
Omg! Love it when you say schnitzels!
When I read the title I was like let me say a little prayer before I watch it.
Ha your house was built in the 1920? Mine was built in 1864
I would probably either contact a priest or someone in that category, but if you don't believe in that religon or stuff I would move into a big  newly built apartment with a ton of people be friends with your neighbors and distract/ avoid yourself from it.  








and yes I'm commenting this in December when she posted this in August but whatever lmao.
This is Eva
👩🏽
1 like=10 Prayers
Edit: I HAVE A CONSPIRACY! Maybe when you house was first built, a mother had a lot of children and abused then and now the are vengeful. They haunt whoever lives in that house now because they are angry with what their mother/guardian is to them
Long island medium
PUT A CAMERA IN YOUR ATTIC !!!
You should talk to graveyardgirl
These vids freak me out cuz this is actually real life don’t play with spirits kids you and the ppl you know could end up in danger💗🙏

AVA U SHOUKD GET BRENT TO MOVE IN
OMG EVA HAS TO SEE THIS!!! 😱😱😱
There’s a place called Boothe Brothers Music in Spanish Fork, Utah. Maybe that place has something to do with what was written on the plank?
This is legit out of a horror film 😳
The music is so creepy I keep turning it down😂
Please do a part four!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Literally my life is hauntings every single night
in part one the cat was doing the same thing as in part 3 with the dog so maybe they see something that you don't?

YOU are ROCKING that ORANGE LOOK
I stared at those two curly hair tendrils the whole time. Idky.
0:29 omg who else saw that 😮
It’s obvious Eva is not l she looks genuinely scared and wish it never happened. She also has so much concrete proof that literally can’t be denied.!!
This is low-key SO FREAKY
In your background I literally just saw a ghost walking behind you
Anyone else notice that Eva has lived in like 2,000 houses😂😂😂
When you said mr boogie that was what I was thinking .That movie terrified me
Love this series!!!!

This is my theory (im not saying its true) : Eva saw 5-7 kids in her vision, this links to both brothers because there were multiple children and in her old apartment there were two men.... The both brothers AKA the kids in the vision 🤔🤔
Omg eva god bless you stay safe
There are children in your attic but they don't come out cuz they don't want you to see them and I don't know what to say because that's pretty creepy and I don't know what to say OMG so basically you need to find out I wouldn't leave the house if I was you and scared emoji and I asked not to leave the house cuz you need to find out what is there lights out super interesting and just imagine you saw the children maybe they were hiding or something they must be older now I don't know but you need to go back to the house and find out what was there cuz that is amazing thing I ever heard dab dab dab dab I really like your videos and I'm the your best I'm your fan your best fan ever love you muah muah be your biggest fan and I think everybody is your biggest fan 👯👼💁🙆👼 go up to the attic and discover I bless you so you won't get hurt or you want me to die or something
Why does every you tuber have paranormal experience?
Night paralysis from anxiety
This actually gave me the chills 😬
I know I've watched this a thousand times but I just noticed this that you should try pagpag
wow, we stan a haunted queen
Omg ave I gust looked up main street spanish fork. And its a fork in the road in utah also there was a car crash right at the that exact place
Eva you should totally watch Supernatural so you'll know how to protect yourself from ghosts 😂💗
Oof say oof if u offed
Watching this at 11:00 pm, I’m already scared and I haven’t even started watching 💀😭😭😂
Leave a bible in there. If they gonna be up there they might as well clean or read the gospel
Adam and Eve      Adam and Eva
Coincidence I think NOT!!
Is there gonna be a part 4? I’ve watched parts one two and three now and I rly like ur storytimes!
omg I have an attic in my room. Like one of those not on the ceiling, but those doors that lead to an attic. then i have two more of those across the hall from me. And an actual attic in the hallway.
Your the best vlogger ever 😊😊😘
conspiracy theory... the ghost wants Adam for themselves 😯😂

When is there going to be an update?! I need to know what happens!!!
Man I had to close the video after the drawing part lol
I'm basically Danny fantom
Love the DIY music where she’s telling scary stories
its ok, you can hide in the comments with me. your safe here!!
Who also watched that movie she mentioned there 4:07 ???? It's amazing and those kids at the attic where so creepy tho saying shhhh you'll know if you whatched it tho.
Edit: it's sinister if you haven't watched it
Main Street Spanish fork is a place! Do you think that maybe the ghosts in the attic moved there after living in your house or were born there? Or maybe two brothers for Main Street Spanish Fork at 2:30pm came and killed everyone in your house..?




(Like so Eva can see!)
You can see someone walk behind eva
Ghost try to scare you to prey off your energy so they could become powerful
* Sees Title * Grabs Holy water cause i dont mess with demons LETS GO

Edit: OMG EVA THE QUEEN NOTICED ME
Don't worry your safe in the comment section 😉
You should get your house blessed by a priest
Would like to see #4 medium !! 👍🏼
Is the movie Siniste? I've seen that movie and I was sooo creeped out!!!
😱😱😱😱
I did some research and this is what i found:

Two of the children — Emery, 12, and Zion, 11 — were killed Sept. 27 with toxic levels of diphenhydramine and methadone.

Their parents — Benjamin, 37, and Kristi, 36 — killed themselves with overdoses. Benjamin used heroin, while his wife mixed methadone, dextrorphan, diphenhydramine and doxylamine.

The couple's third child, 14-year-old Benson, also died from diphenhydramine and doxylamine, but police could not determine if he was killed or if he decided to kill himself with his parents.

The family's oldest child, a boy, was not home at the time.

Family members told police the parents regularly spoke about fearing "evil in the world" and needing to escape the planet's "impending doom." Family members also suspected undiagnosed mental illnesses for the parents.

Five members of the Strack family were found dead in their home last September from what police have now determined was a drug-fueled murder-suicide.
Even so, police don't understand what really led to the family's fatalities.

Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said Tuesday: "There are some questions that we can't answer and may never answer."

Police didn't find any suicide notes in the Strack home, but they did see a letter Benson wrote to a friend, two days before the family died, in which he seemed "aware he might die," family spokesman Bob McGee told the Salt Lake Tribune.

The five bodies were found in the house's master bedroom, with a cup of red fluid next to each one. Four of the family members were arranged under covers and Benjamin was on top of the covers, indicating he died last.

While searching the home, police also found empty bottles of cold and flu medicine, a baggie of marijuana, a pitcher of red juice and a bucket with orange-yellow liquid in it.

Pls ava read this this is what i found.
Bless you Eva xoxo
My scary story:





My phone is at 1%... wow that gives me the chills, thats the scariest story ive ever told

Who else is hiding in the commennntttss 😅😅🙈🙈🙈

Edit: OMG thank you for the likes!!  😲😲
I WANT PART 4
The reason y ur dog was growling so much is because dogs can communicate with ghosts and the dogs can scare them away by growling/barking
My dog ash would go outside every night at around 9 every night and start barking.I used to think that he was howling at the moon until one night he started acting like he was fighting something or someone and he was doing that for about 20 mins and I dont have any more dogs and I didn't have a cat and my nieghbours dont have pets so my mom called in a priest and he said that there was some kind of negative force "demons" in my house and ash was communicating with them. We were so scared we moved the next week and to this day I still have nightmares about that house and for some reason I always see a guy with a pitch fork standing with three boys and they wouldn't move a muscle 😨😨😨😨😨
I broke the like button because I love these story times... sorry... but i kind of ment to😁
1920?! Oh no someone died in that house!
The papers and stuff said 2:30, but you kept waking up at 2:30...
These sound effects are literally the best/worst.
Anyone else trying to not watch but is so glued in!?
wow Eva I'm in love with what you do you are the best when you do these
It’s 5:00 in the morning pouring rain and then thunder lightning I jump out my bed and bang my head on the floor
Can you please make a 4th video
I always wake up at night around 3am and Im always scared so eva were like the same since i always wake up like 5 times lol
i saw a thing that the booth brothers made music but couldnt find anything else
u r soo brave eva, if it was me i would just leave and move in with my mom😂
“Smells like fart”😂😂😂 What a good way to make this video 0.01% less scarier
maybe your "friends" hate the light?
booth brothers were actors who did some ghost show or whatnot 
and the Spanish fork  is in Utah were theres like ghost sighting 
think their connected to evas story leave a like if you do
I know maybe nothing else has happened but yeah, pls? like if you agree
My great granny told me if you keep waking up in the middle of the night something or someone is looking at you
omg you wont belive me but i live near spanish fork utah there is a place on main street called booth brothers
who eles went back to the thumbnail
Remember about your vision about tje 6 to 7 kids
this happened to me before now that I remember
I think that every like time you get a new house, get an exorcist and if there's still funky things going on get another one. I just want you to feel/be safe, you're my favourite you tuber!  💕❤
Did y’all hear that purring sound1443 and 1456
I don't have an attic thank god
thumbs up if you think eva should get an apartment instead haunted homes 😂
and both brothers theres a place in spanish fork called BOOTHE BROTHERS maybe they spelled boothe wrong and spelled both
I am writing this in the middle of the video so if you have mentioned it so sorry to waste your time, but then you can try someone who can talk to ghosts ...
Make a story time channel
This video is so so creepy when you are gone alone (i am home alone right now)
Who else is scrolling though the comment to see if something will happen while watching... 🤪🙀🙋‍♀️
And oooh honey your electricity bill will be out of this world!
Not tryna bring creepyness but I swear like spirits etc like things that r all the same numbers for example 22:22, ur haunting had been going on for 3 years, at 3 houses, and Adam was gone for 3 days

Just move away, it's better than risking anyways.
Good thing I don't have an attic.

If you need a non-haunted place to live, there is space for you here at my house. 

And I live in Wimbledon so it will be soooooo far away from your CABIN HOME THING. Your dog is also welcome. I have a big black lab.
this is so scaryyyyy

I keep hearing eerie music at night! It freaks me out. I live with my family but it seems like no one notices it.
Who else came to the comments because you got the chills (scared) ? 
ME
OMg Ava that is so scary are you ok
I love your vids
I think you should installed camera in your attic or get a roommate. One like helps eva
The good thing about my room is that the moonlight shines in my room soo I can see everything!
ok you really need to read this so i searched up spanish fork main street in google maps and on that street is boothe brothers music store. i did a lot of research and it turns out they have MEETINGS EVERY WEDNESDAY AT 2:30PM totally makes sense
It could be the kids picture at your old house by your door😨😱
You say that your being haunted every where you go, well when you said it smells like a fart, sometimes that is a sigh on demonic present. LOL
You should have your new house be blessed by a priest I know of it working for multiple people
You know that honalay would dark or graul at a wall and that Eva had a vision about an old woman rocking by the master bedroom that's probably what honalay what's grouling at leave a like if you agree with me
LOVE THE BUNS! WE LOVE A CURLY HAIRED SISTER
Little tip Eva if you wake up on 3am that means a demon that you can not see woke you up to get you scared
Oh... I actually have nightmares
My dog barks at the walls
When u mentioned the meeting thing it reminded me of the film the others😭
I'd be like hell naw
Casper must know we’re u live lol
Omg I threw my phone right at the beginning
Fork-resturant, german- spanish
does anyone else see shadows at the corner of their eye but then when they look it’s not there. i know this is random but yeah, anyone?
why she be saying "Crans"....like dude, its CRAY-ONS
I bet your dog was barking at a 👻
Was the music reeaaly necessary cause im freaking th flip out because of it 😅
who else got scared about this????
Spanish Fork is a city in Utah. There is a music shop called Boothe Brothers Music. Shops adress is 135 N Main Street. This doesn't make any sense.
And also Christopher Saint Booth and Philip Adrian Booth known as "The Booth brothers" are twins from England who make movies and documentaries about paranormal activities.
Part 4 please😂
Omg this is so scary
Did you see in the morning if your cat was alright.
0:37 you can see a person moving behind her in the second clip
my house is over 180 years old, how do you think i feel hahahaha
Love these even though you’ve had such bad experiences I love your stories
I have an attic😱😱 now I am scared of my attic well I was before but now I hear thumps ( they are loud a little) when I am home alone……WHY🤷‍♀️
I think it is because you are sooooooooooo scared you are hearing things
I'm watching this at 2 am
i came to the comment section to not feel so scared lol.. anyone else? 😳
Also are you still living there
0:38 who is that in the glass door
My tv glitches at night
there needs to be a finale!
Guys i did some research and found something :
So a family (strack) is the name of the family they lived in a house in spanish fork,UT they  had 3 kids 2boys and a girl (all of them are blonde) their names are (zion benjamin and kristi) and back in September 2017 the parents (i searched alot but couldn't find their names) poisoned their own children  from the fear of  apocalypse and then both of them comitted suicide  and the creepy part is that when you search on google the only picture that comes up (of all of them together) the little girl which i suppose is kristi is wearing a fucking bow on her head and a lot of people say that the parents had a obsession over a  killer named RON LAFFERTY , he was the leader of a cult called BLOOD BROTHERS but he was arrested and judged in 1996, april 2, Tuesday so he's either in prison or dead that's not the point but he was the one that had a influence on the parents too
Love the natural hair my natural hair is curly to like yours like really curly
Both brothers is a music store at Spanish fork Main Street
Fist of all who would play in the attic
anyone else reading comments because it’s too scary😂

edit: this is the most likes I have got on a comment wow, ty x
This is freaky my heart is pounding but it kinda of interesting
yesss post another vedio of you talking to the people abot it. I had a similar experience with the cat thing and hearing footsteps all over and the countertop situation
“The second attic tho”
Do you know what is very wired that happened to me like everything you said happened to me
you better get a priest in there before the ghost children snatch your wig
That is so werid
Can I make a movie of this
Have you had sleep paralysis yet. Its epic.
Can you make a part 4 maybe?
Who needs horror movies when you have Eva😂🙌🏻
16:41 21:21 right..
It's kind of a stretch to call that house in Malibu amazing after you described its appearance and setup... with photos and video. 😬
Why am I watching this and I am scared of dolls🤦🏽‍♀️ now I am scared to get out of bed and I have to use the bathroom 😬
I think she lives somewhere different now. Comment if your hear in 2019 too.

Dogs could see ghost 👻 also people can see what your day would be
omg I love eva
Anyone  watching in 2019? Like if yes.
Didn't Escape the Night teach ya not to live in a house built in the 1920s?? Honestly, Eva😂😂
I don’t like it I love the series
There were a bunch of car crashes on a street called main Spanish fork.
Shane Dawson entered the CHAT
On the first night they were letting you know they are with you and to watch your back
EVA PUT HEAT SENSITIVE CAMERAS IN YOUR HOUSE!
I thing main street spanish fork is a resturant thats why there is a menú and i sreach it up and it said it was a resturant and i also think that the meeting that they were having was the that resturant sounds
Hi random person
Maybe you should make a video were you go and see that house again
Do you ever get scared to sleep?
I just found out that there’s a music store on Main Street in Spanish fork called BOOTHE BROTHERS! That totally makes sense!
I have 3 attics and one is above another
Awww. Hearing about ghost children, makes me sad 😕 it makes you wonder if there really is another side...Or if heaven is real or not.
This should be a movie 😂
Whats a cran btw I'm from uk if that's any help
this need to be a movie
Move in with Brent 😂😂
Pt. 4 please
Can you tell me what is going on
my name is nina lol
WAIT, I’M SPOOKED AF RN BUT I’LL WATCH BECAUSE OF EVA 💖😭
The ghost has to be Dear David
My dog use to growl at the wall and we talk to some one and they said there is someone infront them
BRO EVA my attic has a baby alive doll and a cabby patch kids voodoo doll in there its so creepy like 
#whowentinthereatticwhenANADULTWASNTTHER #its justmeinsnt
CALL THE COPS!!
I would have instantly left the house.
play worship songs when you feel like something is there and say a little prayer for the spirit to go away
😱 omg so 😰👹😈
I WANT PART 4!
I can't do that
I hope you are 👍🏾🦄
Wow adam and eva, I just realized that.
How can you sleep alone in that house?? I would sleep with my friends!
Adam just has that good positive energy that keeps ghosts away, do t let him go 😂
Why do people not like it  is real








Or there a scaredy-cat
leave the demons to there demons
Note to self.....:DO NOT WATCH THIS AT NIGHT!






😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I wouldn’t bring a medium in your new house that has nothing wrong with it
I’m calling Shane and Ryan
👵🏻  
🧥
👡
You should have blessed that house everywhere I mean everywhere
It seems like a ghost that likes to play tricks on you it knows if your scared so it likes to play tricks on you when you feel uneasy or sad or scared [I do not know a lot about ghost or spirits I just like watching scary shows lmao]
And my name is Hathora
The difference between the two of us 
Eva: I just stayed in my bed

Me: I ran to my car and speed at 400 mph and ran into McDonald’s yelling there here
I am dun with dis video byee
Work with Shane and the Psychic Twins!!!
Aren't u so scared to live there
Called Sophie Swasey
So I am very religious and basically what I have heard at church is when things like this happen it is very real and I know people who have experienced things similar. And I have had some weird experiences too. If you believe in Jesus Christ then when you feel a presence you should say “ in the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave” it has real power and I know it works
I know that you are but I know who the host is
hold on so what happened with your cat
I don't think it is true..😏😎
is caroline the girl who watched her cat in her latest video 🤔...

IS THIS TRUE
You should get a roommate 😣😣😣
In this video your eye looks creepy
I love story time
but its your hand writing
fat prayers for u
if you watch horror movies a lot you should know NOT to buy a house with an attic.. 😂😭
Saw the beginning and I was like....and the fact that I’m a person with paranoia 😂😂😂I should nor be watching this shit.u got a scary life tho.ur a brave one
When I watch eva’s story time I feel like I’m living in that moment
Because I "care" about my cat.
Maybe the reason u were waking up while Adam was gone because of anxiety attacks
OK WTF ALSO MOOD SET UP ON POINT
Eva!!Please stop with the music!!😁 I'm terrified!!😬
why am I watching this,I am home alone
I have had this happen and I hear big foot steps and I'd wake up at 2:30 and then wake up again at 3:00am
Hey Eva you should talk to other people
I love how Eva is so open about this!
im so diying 😸😬😵
Their are actual ghoast busters that you can use to at ride of ghoasts my friends nan is one.btw Love you x
Okay i know this video is old but was there someone in the room with you during part 1? because you can see someone moving on the door’s reflection during the clip in this video’s intro
that happens to me
THE PLAYDOH IN THE INTRO GAVE ME CHILLS. I dont know if Im ready for this video!!!!
This is interesting and it’s also creepy. I wish their was a part 4
that house looks like the house from the poltergeist
PLEASE PART 4
I’m getting a house with no attic lol 😂
I have a scary story 




NO WIFI 



😂😂
I literally saw like 2 seconds o this and I was like let me make sure I’m around someone😨
#keepmakinggouststories
Honestly i think that the cat thing was spirits trying to bait u and trying to get u to come and look for ur cat and I haven't experienced anything like this before so I could be wrong
The attic has a long history .But not all are good.
I don’t have a attic thank the lord
Spanish thing Main Street I think is connected to the menu?
So haunted and apooky im new her can i have a shout out
It’s 10:38 at night and here I am....wish me luck 😬
Why do you literally move into the creepiest places in the first place lol
She’s not even a haunted story time YouTuber and I feel like this was 110% true / more true than any other haunted video storytime ever
Watching this at night😅
I wake up at 3am most nights and can't  go back to sleep untill 5am
HOLY TACO 🌮 I’m watching at night
Lol do a 24 hours in my attic challenge😂
When I first started this vid I had my light off in my room not in the whole house just in my room 5 minutes into the video my light is on amd I constantly keep checking my room to see if there's anyone in it
Someone in there haunting you
wait you saw insidious 1-2-3-4-and 5 ? i only saw 2 because someone had to change the channel
Sitting all alone 
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren’t far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies 

Where’s my mind 
Where’s my mind 

They’ll be here pretty soon
Looking through my 
Room for the money 
I’m biting my nails 
I’m to young 
to go to jail
It’s kinda funny 

Where’s my mind 
Where’s my mind 
Where’s my mind 
Where’s my mind 

Maybe it’s in the gutter 
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate 
My V is for vendetta 
Thought that I’d feel better
But now I got a bellyache 

Everything I do 
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace 
I wanna make em scared
Like I could be anywhere 
Like I’m wreakless

I’ve lost my mind 
I don’t mind
Where’s my mind 
Where’s my mind 

Maybe it’s in the gutter 
Where I left my lover 
What an expensive fate
My V is for vendetta 
Thought that I’d feel better
But now I got a bellyache 

Maybe it’s in the gutter 
Where I left my lover 
What an expensive fate
My V is for vendetta

Eva is over the ghost 😂 like ya I’m  haunted so what
If I would have heard that sound in the middle of the night I’d probacly run straight out of my house haha lol
You might just be the person to convince me to believe in paranormal activity. You are someone I can believe.
Why is this sooooooooo creepy😭
This is so creepy 

Like if you agree
soooo... i'm not sleeping tonight
Ava: adam told me... Wait it smells like a fart sniffs
Should I be watching this at 3:15?🤣
I am always so interested in the paranormal. And I'm really good at it too. I'm basically a 13 year old medium. So here is some advice.  When ur puppy stares at the window or the wall she probably sees a spirit of some sort of shadow person. Shadow ppl are real ppl, but they are also ghosts and live in secret. Btw I love the name of ur puppy. It's adorAble! Also, at a point in the video you said, " it smells like a fart "  when you smell bad smells or the temperature is different in parts of the houswe. That usually means there is a ghost there with u. When someone dies, they either go to heaven, hell, or there is this world right in between depending on your religious beliefs. I'm my beliefs there is no heaven or hell. There is either just death, or a world in between. And sometimes , let's take   Catholic for exmpl. Let's say a person is good enough for heavan, but they aren't bad enough for hell. They get stuck in between those two worlds. Therefore, being cAlled the paranormal, and we all just have to learn to live in harmony with each other
Put some security cameras in there!!
JUST BELIEVE ME!!!!
"Im scared to even look at the attic " 💀💀 "from the ceiling"😂😂
I hoped you moved
2:30 wasnt that wen she would wake up
I have had those visions  they feel like your asleep but at the same time awake and you can clearly see every thing around but u don't seem to move or anything. 17:20
Didn't you wake up at 2:30 AM??????
I regret watching this at night!
Boat brothers is a place in Finland and Spanish fork is a place in Utah
Sister spooky
throws holy water GOD HELP
Once when I was younger I decided to prank my brother by putting plastic wrap around his door. I waited until 2 something in the morning so I knew he would be asleep. Keep in mind he lived in our basement because there wasn't a open bedroom for him upstairs. I was wrapping his door when I suddenly heard footsteps above me Wich meant someone was upstairs. It could not of been anyone else I'm my family because my parents were on vacation. I was super scared to go upstairs but I did and nothing was there. At the time I had the flue so I was sleeping on the couch. I was asleep them woke up. I was half asleep and was awake for just a few seconds. In these few seconds I saw a shadow about ten or fifteen feet away from me. Nothing since head happened. Scariest moments of my life.
She literally waggs her finger that,that was not there when she started talking about the Cat my ears blocked now I'm scared
14:36  listen closely you can hear a voice in the back round but like a weird voice like if you can hear it 😳😳☠️☠️
Yessßsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss part 3
Does Your dog know how to draw
Some people say that dogs can see spirits so maybe your dog saw one
I am so sorry for Eva because she goes through these freaking scary things
Spanish fork is a city in Utah, so maybe the owner of the house (b4 u) wants to meet someone there, and they're trying to meet in the main Street...
Omg, this kind of reminds me of the movie Truth or Dare...
Getting Halloween vibes👻🎃

I love how Eva can make silly faces and still be pretty, but I can't.
The meaning of this song is perfection! She’s dancing to distract you from the fact that she’s coming out as bi!! Such a unique way! So much love to Eva!
Anyone listening in 2019??💛💛
...i still don't know what the balloons in the background say 😐

Hi Eva. Your probably not going to see this, but I need to say something. I have been BI sense I was 9. This has helped me understand myself and we all accept you. 🥰😄
PS - I always listen to this song in school!!
1:08 omfg idk why that part is always so satisfying
We love a bisexual queen
I started dancing to this after eating soup 🤣 ughhhhhh I hurt!!!
As a fellow Bi-sexual and currently loving a girl, this was the first song on my playlist on iTunes and we were in the car as the first song, so this is now OUR song♡ You are such an inspiration to me, to love myself, and my personality, Thank you soooo much Eva and remember that I love you so so sooo much! p.s. Thanks for the wig inspo too!XD
I love how she inspires people to follow their dreams and this showed me to do anything and follow my dreams because one day I will do it and this inspires me so much to do what I love ❤️
Dancers eating donuts?! UNHEARD OF!
it doesn't matter what your sexuality is, what really matters is who's going to eat the rest of those donuts 0:38
Who else scrolls through the comments while listening? 😂
That persons laugh 😂😂😂3:09
I freaking love this song!!!  This is the 100 time listening to it
Honestly one of the best YouTubers music videos out there❤️

[Lyrics]

Verse 1
Driving riding shotgun,
Chilling coming undone,
Barely any gas but we'll be okay.
Everybody outside,
Will make fun of our style,
I don't really care what people say.
And you don't really know me,
My mind's like a movie,
And I'm praying you'll wanna come press play.
You keep me distracted,
I'm sorry for my actions,
When you make me dance like I'm on display.

Pre-Chorus
Don't worry 'bout the other side,
No reason we can't come alive,
Your body's like a paradise,
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied x3
Your body's like a paradise,
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied.

Chorus
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me,
I'll chase the sparks of your reality,
(I'll dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe,
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me.
(I'll dance as a distraction)

Verse 2
All these little moments,
I loose all my focus,
I hope this is not just in my head.
You don't have to fake it,
Imagine if we dated,
Or we could just stay good friends instead.

Pre-Chorus
Don't worry 'bout the other side,
No reason we can't come alive,
Your body's like a paradise,
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied x3
Your body's like a paradise,
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied.

Chorus
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me,
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll chase the sparks of your reality,
(I'll dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe,
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me.
(I'll dance as a distraction)

Chorus
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me,
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)dance as a distraction)
I'll chase the sparks of your reality,
(No reason we can't dance as a distraction)dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe,
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me.
(No reason we can't dance as a distraction)dance as a distraction)

Don't worry 'bout the other side,
No reason we can't come alive,
Your body's like a paradise,
I'll dance as a distraction.

I love how u did hype!
Is this gonna be like the literally my life trend again?
I think I might be bisexuals too... I'm kind of scared to say anything about it and I've never said anything about it. Sometimes I can't face it and I hope that I'm not, but things like this make me feel a lot better. I've got it a lot better than most, at least, since the girl that I think is making me realize it is gay, so...
Wanna know something? Im bi too 😣💗
This song is so good like if you agree
Literally my life WHO?!! 😂💖
I love how Eva has the same donut in every music vid
Such an awesome way of coming out! I love you Eva!!
Amazing ilu girl we get your sexuality
I love this 1st.
2nd:I’m a bisexual too.
3rd;This is the best way  to show who you really are.
4th I am usually a lesbian but I’m obsessed with drawing anime boys so i’m bi.

6th your voice is bootiful.
And lastly,7th,You inspire people everyday with your bootiful song,Keep it up bisexual sister!

#1 jump out of Bed

LOVE this!!!!!
It might be the lack of sleep but this has me in full on tears 😭❤️ It makes me so happy to see this, to have liking girls feel so normal and not be displayed as a dirty or sexual thing. You made it seem what it’s meant to be- a simple rush that gives you butterflies and makes you want to dance. Ahhhhh, I love it, I love YOU. This is SO GOOD
Thank u brent
I made a dance for this song practiced for a month showed it to my mom she loved and I cried I love u sooo much eva !!!!❤️

No way last part caught me off guard but is she like bisexual or a lesbian now? ❤️
This song, for me, means so much - it even has a thing to teach to the younger generation which i think is magical. To think how far you’ve come since Literally My Life has inspired me, you put hard work into everything you do. After everything you’ve been to and no matter how much i grow up, you’ll always be the girl i’ve known on youtube for the longest, and the girl i’ll continue to watch down the line. i truly do feel so happy watching this video, as of any video i do. You really do make it work Eva. i love this so much. it’s definitely my new happy song, thankyou for that
Ahhh i support 🏳️‍🌈 LQBTQ
i am bi and I have a crush on my friend .. struggles
GO GIRL!!!!!!!
Is she bi? I don’t know her that well apologies

IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS..... FINALLY!!!!!!!!
14:13.
Thank me later
Am I the only person who JUST learned she was bi....
not hating just sayin': isn't it interesting how clothes are made for our bodies yet we alter our bodies to fit in them lol :P
14:13 you’re welcome
you and shane should go ghost hunting together!!!
Le boob job is mentioned at 14:15, thank me later.
And here I am wanting a breast reduction, oh well. Happy for you!
1.) I woke up
2.) I saw Eva outside
3.) I ran to her and hugged her
4.) I cried







How it really was: 2 3 1 4
"Hit it, and take it out to Applebee's" 
This is how you do it, friends.
Would love to hear about your boob job experience - I’m petite and was not too blessed in that area so I’ve been thinking about getting them done (like  you) just to show that I have some but don’t know where to start...really appreciate it. Thanks :)
14:12
Ur welcome.
Girl shout out your plastic surgeon !!
Can you talk about the procedure and the recovering please? Thanks :)
You me story of being bi is LITTERALY me in June I made some biesexuality pride flag cupcakes to give to people who were bi when people asked me why it  I obviously said "because I'm bi " and some people were so frickin shook because I never felt the need to come out YOU know?
Talking about your reaction to the accident is not dramatic! Being rear ended is the worst (but most common type of) car related accident. I’ve been rear ended twice and it’s extremely painful and car accidents are SOO traumatic! I can’t even imagine being rear ended at 80 mph.. so horrible! But glad you bounced back!!
omg u should totally do a video with Emma!
I want to be your best friend I relate to almost everything and you have helped me stay positive thank you!!!
I think everyone first encounter of BTS is an accident tbh...that accident then becomes ur freaking life … #truestory #lifeofarmy

Video idea: Shane & Eva sit down and Shane tells his conspiracy theories and the two of them talk about them. Then they do the same thing on Eva’s channel but she tells Shane her theories ❤️❤️

Eva was, like, realizing things

pluck some hair out of your wig, in the spot where you have parted it. Making the hair thinner at the part makes it look more realistic.

This hair suits you so much and you look more matured
Love you ❤️
Omg yay Eva you are back on youtube! YAYYYYYY!!!

Shane doesn’t do collars anymore. He mentioned in one of his videos that he’s very uncomfortable and self conscious when he does collabs and can’t act like himself.

I’m bisexual too and I had the same experience as you. We never discussed lgbt related things in my house so I didn’t grow up with any idea of what it was. I just knew that I thought boys were cute and I thought girls were cute too. And I never hid that
I didn’t know u we’re bye sexual
Red!!! Red hair
