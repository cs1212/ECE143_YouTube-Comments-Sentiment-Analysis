Menstrual equity!! So glad to hear this acknowledged. ❤️
"Not shiedling men from period exposure" is actually so important. My best guy friend was brought up in a household with nothing but women and he is SO CHILL and helpful when his period-having friends are on their period. It's just refreshing to have a cis-man around that is not completely grossed out by a completely normal bodily process.
Loved this video! its so important none of us are embarrassed about everything us girls go through. I recently just put a video up getting my PAP SMEAR done....get it booked girls! BRILLIANT video Ingrid, thank you 💗
This title made me remember a Friends' episode that Chandler was only one in the theatre and the actress goes '' Chapter one, My first period! '' 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am in love with your content lately. What a wonderful video!!! 🥰 Thank you for making it.
Fr whose on their period tho🤫
I've been watching your videos for quite a few years now, starting when I was in my young teens, and honestly you have made such an impact on my life. Your coming out video made me feel more comfortable accepting my pansexual identity, and I honestly still think about it to this day. You've always been such a positive role model for me, and I'm so so happy to see that you're doing so well because it gives me hope for my own future ❤️. Thank you so much for having been an awesome influence here on YouTube ❤️
DAng. Period at 15? I was 11. You were lucky.
Who out here suffering with endo 🙋‍♀️
Thank you for the honesty and bravery when it comes to talking about periods. I've been trying to break the weird stigma around periods for a while and this gave me a boost of confidence. All my love, XO.
Conversations with my brother )) about period, never ever going to happen. 🙅 he is one of those  😒
Mine has gotten worse as I’ve gotten older.  The cramps have gotten worse, it affects my stomach, my back hurts, I have breast tenderness.  I’ve always used pads, never cared for tampons.
Good timing, lol 🔴
For real though, I love period discussions and videos. 2019 is the year of not hiding your pads and tampons up your sleeve, ya know?
I bought Rael pads at target just the other day!! So excited to see them sponsoring you ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Ingrid! You inspired me to start my own Youtube channel! QUEER ASIANS UNITE!!! ❤️💛💚💙💜
Your videos always make my day and you are a huge inspiration to even though I’m pretty new to Youtube and only have 2k! Sm love ❤️
Menstrual cups are not a thing in the us yet? it really changed the game here, and it is not as wasteful :)
Love this video! I've been looking for products like this. Thank you for making this video
Girl, get you some reusable pads!! They are life changing and they last years and years and years, and are so much softer than disposables.
it's honestly such a relief to hear someone talk about periods so casually! no stigma here
There’s so many misconceptions about periods (even among women) and I think it’s important for men to understand that it really isn’t a big deal. if we can talk about it with our moms, sisters and friends, there’s no reason why we need to keep it a secret from men/boys just because they don’t experience it.
Yay for promoting organic products :)
Pad power, dude! I usually double up, a tampon and a pad because sometimes ya just leak a little.
You always bring great content and your original period video years ago really helped me not feel ashamed for wearing pads
i FEEL YOU on the pads vs tampons discussion!
Love this video! Did you stop using a menstrual cup? I’d love to know your thoughts on them!
Just started watching but I love listening to you 😇
Nice one gal! I'm also turning 30.. not sure how I got there so fast but never felt better about myself! :) Keep up the positive posts xx
Have you ever tried menstruel cup? I used to use pads in a long time then menstruel cup literally changed my life! It’s less messy, better for environment and a lot cheaper. It makes you feel like you’re not on a period, and unlike tampons or some kinds of pad, it doesn’t provoke allergies.
i always find these fascinating to watch, love u lots ingrid❤️
You empower me! I'm in the middle of both books you recommended, Like a Mother and Text Me When You Get Home. Thank you for spreading knowledge ❤
Love this brand (the pads are truly like little pillows). Love your openness about menstruation. And YES periods are not just experienced by girls 🙌🏻
Thank you for speaking so openly about our periods 🙂 As an over age 40 woman, I just placed an order for several of Rael’s products after watching this video. I am loving that I am actually excited about receiving period products! 😂 (And yes, periods over 40 in my experience are really different!) ~Krislynner
So inspiring!! <3 I can't live without Rael products!
Thank you a million times over for always creating great, thought-provoking content like this. I'm glad younger women can see this and realize it's okay to talk about periods.
Ingrid, I found your twin. Look up actress Maia Mitchell. ❤️
Thanks for the nice video, I think the book the woman code might be helpful to you when dealing with your hormonal balance☺️
I love how open you are with these topics, not a lot of youtubers open up like this and it's so nice to see! ❤️
Thank you for letting me know about the Rael brand!! I am also a pad-wearer!!
I’ve been watching you for such a long long time, It’s so cool to see how you’ve  come such a long way & evolved. Love you forever, seriously one of my favorite OG youtubers 💖
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜♥️ Thank you!
i love these videos ingrid. it's been amazing to see the person you've become💕
Um, babe alert! Girl you're looking incredible!😘😍
I loved this video, Ingrid! Thanks for being such a brave feminist. <3
Love you, Ingrid. I used to watch you in high school and now I'm close to finishing college. You are like an older sister to me. Many greetings
I love how gender inclusive you are!
So good to hear you've made some strides on the comfort with your period around using pads and generally discussing it :)

Obviously I have no idea how you're choosing to deal with your change in periods but just in case it's of benefit to you or anyone else watching - my periods changed for the worst 6 years ago when I developed a chronic illness. Its been a bit of a rollercoaster ngl and I'm still figuring things out but it forced me into learning more about my body and as much as I struggle with feeling out of control with all my health stuff, it's been really empowering to learn more about the ways in which my lifestyle choices affect my hormonal system and periods. Diet, supplements and working through stress and emotional trauma have been major factors for me. It's been years of me getting to know my body better and starting to see my period as a bit of a canary in the coal mine with regards to the way I've been living for that month.

I'm not going to pretend that my periods are good right now - I'm on day 5 of my cycle currently and spent the first four days in bed which was considered pretty good for me given that during my last cycle I was fully in the not so conscious on the bathroom floor not functioning well enough to know if I should phone an ambulance and not having an option due to how incoherent I would have been. So yeah they suck. But I also know that it was because I hadn't been eating so well and I hadn't been dealing with my mental health and stress levels that month. And I have had long stretches of essentially symptom free periods when I have managed things successfully. 

I'm not sure if I'm making any sense with this but I guess my point is that before learning more about my body, I just accepted bad periods as entirely normal and out of my control, without understanding that our concept of normal periods is warped by the fact our lifestyles for the most part aren't supportive of good menstrual health and the way our medical system works means that period related illnesses are underdiagnosed and all that. It was only after reading into it that I learnt about how many lifestyle factors there are and how much of an affect we can have if we choose that route. I do want to be clear though that choosing to figure things out is entirely a choice I have made and I also have the choice of medication in order to try and help if that's something I want to explore at some point cause yay I live in a country where that's accessible to me - meaning I have zero judgement or agenda around this, I know it's a sensitive topic because sometimes choosing medications is looked down upon as disempowering or whatever bs when ultimately the important and empowering thing is a person having the freedom to make that decision for themselves.

Basically if your periods change for the worst - learn about it! Don't just accept it as a new normal without figuring out why that's happening and if you can change anything to help your situation.
Ingrid, thank you for being you!
I use hemp fabric pads. And alchemilla tisane and magnesium the week before the flow, to prepare for a good cramp free period
I am glad to know that it is normal to have worse cramps as you get older.  I never had cramps growing up, but now at 31 years old I do.
I think is so interesting  how the pads vs tampons discussion is different in different cultures. In Brazil the majority of women wear pads and there's not a lot of tampons options
My period actually got a lot better with age! I used to have a really heavy flow, fainting, cramps, breakouts. Now it's a non-event. Light flow, maybe a bit of cramping. I'm so glad I grew out of that intense stage.
Yes Ingrid 🙌🏽You're the reason I first felt empowered about periods 2 years ago and made me really interested in helping women and girls get access to period products. Thank you for continuing to speak about this!!
Has anybody tried a menstrual cup? Just the size of them alone scares me
I like pads too!! Thank you! <3
Thank you for this video ❤️
Awesome video and discussion about periods. I appreciate how much you try to have valid and important discussions with the community. Periods affect everyone. This helps. Thank you.
So glad you are openly talking about periods. I'm 54 btw and menopausal.
This video would be amazing to show kids in school. You speak about a topic that sooo many shy away from but you speak it in a manner that makes everyone feel comfortable and confident.
“they last for 6 hours which is like an entire day” 🧐
I HIGHLY recommend these pads!!!! I was looking for an organic alternative and came across these. The over night pads are my fav, they have like this wing action going on towards the butt area & they are sooo comfy, no worries about leaks either!!
Have you ever gotten your magnesium levels checked? I used to have cramps that were so painful, I'd black out from the pain. I started taking magnesium (it was lower), and between that and the Diva Cup, I don't even feel inconvenienced by my period at all. It's been life changing! Even with normal magnesium levels, people still find magnesium to be helpful.
I've worn a tampon less than 10 times in my life. I'm 24 and I'm just now exploring using tampons. I have always preferred pads and there's nothing wrong with that!
I'm 24 and I remember when I used to hate starting my periods but now for some weird reason I love starting my period. This video was absolutely amazing and drinking water or drinking tea will help with cramps as well. Love you Ingrid! 💕


My brother is transgender (Used To Be My Sister) I'm very supportive of him and there is sometimes where his pheromones don't work or he forgets to take them and he starts his period...I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this information. 😬✌
Thank you for being a pad advocate!!
Is this going to be a monthly thing where you talk about periods? Because I really like it that you are breaking a taboo! Not only that I find the videos very interesting 🤗
I was hoping you’d make a period video soon! Today was my lucky day 😎 #endperiodstigma
I realise that this video was probably a brand deal, however, it's such a shame that you didn't mention cups or period pants.
Just tried to order some stuff from Rael and it seems like a lot is sold out! Hopefully they get things back in stock.
The first time I had my period I used a pad and was horrified when I realized that the blood would flow to the back when I layed down thereby staining my pajamas. I slept that night sitting up and was really upset in the morning. 

My mom showed me a trick to help me deal with this problem and I've been using it ever since. I've always wondered if any other women have had this issue and if they've dealt with it the same way I have for the past nine years. 🤔 

I know most people wear tampons, but I am just more comfortable with pads. If anyone else if a pillow fan, and deal with the issue mentioned above, how do you manage to not stain your clothes? 

I've heard of people just using a longer pad but it's never enough.
Super thoughtful information packed video. Thank you for talking about periods on your channel. It’s something so many people experience and every one is different. Its so important to not stigmatize our bodies for doing body things. 💜
I noticed the changes in mine from my 20s, 30s and now that I'm 40. I loved this! Thank you for making this!! I hate that it's so taboo to talk about it when it is natural and we can't control it without medical intervention.  You are so sweet and seem so sincere in your content and videos. Love you Ingrid!
I personally like to keep my period info to myself and not talk to men or boys about it and believe it’s an intimate, personal thing for each person who deals with it. So I don’t really agree with Ingrid, but I respect her opinions and thoughts and anyone else who feels that it should be talked about openly :)
This is a really awesome podcast on pelvic health!! She talks about what causes pain with sex, periods, etc., and that we shouldn't be experiencing that...ever. Not even cramps. 🤯There are simple solutions and this is a facet of women's healthcare that has totally been withheld from us. Seeing a pelvic health specialist should be as normal as seeing an OBGYN. https://open.spotify.com/episode/4nOXAk4AiwZNfZVHURy8Gx?si=vAyslL96Sxi238FDD4tlnA
I don't like tampons too and I find pads are more comfortable and easy for me. Btw, I am going to try reusable pad for the first time, hope this will change my life, because I want to be more earth-friendly
My periods have definitely changed over time and after both of my pregnancies. When I was a teenager I would have cramps and diarrhea and it was about a moderate flow. Now I am almost 26 years old and i have breast pain, headaches, horrible cramps for the first couple days of my period and a heavy flow for the first couple days and then it kinda diminishes. I used to be all hush hush about my period when i was younger but now i dont really care. Everyone knows girls get their period and its just a part of life.
i havent watched your videos for about 6 years and you havent aged a year 😍
Notification squad!!! 💕
Excuse me: any gender can have a period?
Ingrid thank you so much for this video! I love the real talk and the awesome product recommendations. I’m so excited to get my Rael package-- fingers crossed the heating pads come before my period does xo
I'm getting my IUD removed next month and I am SO not looking forward to my period coming back. I used to get the worst cramps and back aches. My hubby and I are trying to get pregnant, so hopefully that happens quickly.
I love you for hating tampons too! 😂 I’ve tried a millions times over and pads are just what I like and that’s it!
I loved the video and its inclusiveness! In the spirit of inclusiveness, I wanted to mention that the term “vegetable” can be derogatory and ableist. The point you’re making about needing to rest is a good one but I think there are ways to make it without the hurt and history of that term. ❤️
I am waiting to get my regular period back after having a baby and I have to say, I miss her! My whole body feels a kind of relief during that time in my cycle; a refresher🌜🌝🌛🌟
I am 26 and I totally relate to my period being completely different than it was a decade ago. This past year it has all changed it’s more of an “experience” before the onset and after. Mentally it has been an adjustment and I have been getting used to how to cope with it.
I can relate to a lot of points. I went from "I wouldn't even notice I have period if not that bit of blood" to "it's first day of my period and I am unable to can". It's annoying sometimes, but it makes me respect my body more. I also never silence the conversation and try to spread the positive outlook on menstruation. My husband moved from being embarrassed when I asked to buy tampons to being 100% comfortable with the concept of period and I am so thankful for that. His embarrassment came as a surprise to me, because we are very open with each other. His shame really hurt me first, but according to him, this shame came from an old stereotype that he formed back in school, and one open conversation, giving just one little thought was enough to understand how irrational it is, he just didn't have a chance to talk about it. So communicating is extremely  important. I can not imagine being silent or embarrassed about menstruation anymore, and your videos helped with that a lot.
Ingrid! Love your videos so much!
Thank you so so so much for talking about gender. Thank you.
Love this. I've discovered so many new things about my period, and my husband actually helped me notice a pattern that I had not noticed before which is that a week before my period I get migraines. I've suffered from migraines my whole life, but hormonal migraines are newer to me, as in the last five years. 
I am love discovering new products that help me manage my period. Love Thinx underwear and I've tried a menstrual cup which sometimes get lazy to clean with boiling water so i use pads and tampons sometimes. There are so many new great ways to manage our periods.
I love you Ingrid but I just wanted to point out to you that it would have been nicer if you had acknowledged your privilege around having so many choices when it comes to managing your period. Many people still don't, for example, many women in India don't even get to use pads and use rotating wash cloths instead which they wash every day to replace the one which they used earlier. I am sure you will take this comment in the utmost positive light. Much love xoxo
Oh Ingrid I wish I had these videos whenI was younger.  I struggled to understand my period and was so ashamed of something that is so natural.  I'm glad this generation can embrace their periods.  Thanks for sharing!! :)
Hope they will have zero waste options in the future :)
I really appreciate the conversation about your period changing. I used to have zero emotional or mental effects during my period but now for the week leading up to my period I feel extremely anxious and have times of deep depression. Because I hadn't been affected in this way before, it took me a long time to realize what was going on and I had no idea what to do. Had it been more common knowledge that your period can change so much over time, I may have been able to manage my changes earlier on. Great video
I also stared mine at 15 and I don't hear of many girls who start that late. I've also always preferred pads too.
My estranged mother told me and my sister about our periods when we were each 7 years old; my sister is 6 years older than me so it wasn’t a group talk. She skimmed the surface but, what she told both of us is, “Periods are dirty. You NEVER speak about them to men, even your father or step-dad. If you feel ill just deal with it on your own. Never ask for them to buy you pads. You come to me.” So, we did just that. I got my period at 12...November 1994 right before Thanksgiving break, when a stomach bug was going around, and I thought I caught it because I was cramping, then I had pink tinged toilet paper after peeing... By then my sister had moved out after she and mother had a huge fight, and I was unknowingly about to be kicked out myself. In SC back then, kids were automatically granted to the mother, and they had to live then until 12. “Ironically” she chose to fight us (we always fought, as she didn’t want either of us) after that mark, and kick us out. 

I’m in a Bible Belt area. Here it is well thought that a woman’s period is dirty because the Bible says it is. Mother was a staunch supporter of that belief, as most are here. Times have changed here but, periods are still hush-hush.  Pads are the only thing you can use. The only thing allowed in your vagina is your husband......I remember vividly while cleaning my room, she came in and saw the insert to a box of tampons. She was fit to be tied! She asked where it came from, and I told her my sisters friend that stayed the night. She asked if I looked at it, I lied, and said not to because there were “dirty photos in it”, the diagrams of the instructions. She chewed out my sister for allowing her friend to bring smut in the house, and for her to NEVER try tampons as they take your virginity.  The next period I had after being kicked out I bought a box and used them to spite her! 😂  

I hated them. So back to pads it was. I had to buy my own things at the convenience store near the house with lunch money I saved because I didn’t want to make my father mad for asking him to buy them. I just hoped he didn’t see me buying them or one of the store clerks to tell him what I bought.

I’m trying to get passed that idea but, I’m still quiet about it. I feel it’s my body, and not everyone’s business. Yet, I don’t want to feel ashamed anymore about it. Thankfully my sister is very open about with my nieces. They’ll tell you point-blank what they’re dealing with, no matter whom is in the listening area. 😂 ♥️
I’m lucky that I’m dating someone who allows me to talk openly about having a period and what goes on with me.
I was really lucky to have a great year 7 teacher who taught us about periods. He was so enthusiastic about the subject and told us how fascinating the cycle is so the classes really fed off his enthusiasm! He made a really awkward and embarrassing subject, super engaging and normal.
You were literally the first public person I ever knew who used pads.  You made me not feel so alone when it seemed everyone else used tampons. I appreciate that you are so open. Also, you look super cute in this video. Striped t shirts are my fave look. 💕
I just got to the part where you’re talking about bringing cis men and boys into the conversation. My husband and sons are very much a part of my and my 3 daughter’s periods. They even help take care of us!
Well I never have period why???? I'm a boy
You can't be 30... omg!
Great Video once again Ingrid. I always enjoy you chats. I am one who just supports everyone’s right to choose what they like best and to be proud of it! NO shade or shame whatsoever. Personally I am not a fan of pads but I used them when I first got it. Then I went to Miami for vacation and my aunt showed me how to use a tampon so I could swim! I never went back to pads. I actually noticed one very important difference when I use tampons. I used to suffer with bad cramps and once changing to tampons the cramps literally disappeared!! I have no idea why I never asked or researched it. My guess is that it’s bc the blood doesn’t have to flow out through the body, it’s just absorbed right inside. I will always wear panty liners to be safe and protect panties from possible stains but pads made me feel insecure. They soak up the blood outside of the body and then it’s just sitting there for a sometimes random period of time. I just personally didn’t like that. But to each her own! My husband is amazing w me and our 4 daughters!! He will proudly buy tampons and pads for us. I am so grateful that he is very open and loving about the topic. I remember asking him to grab some last minute and I said “if you’d rather me go get them I can!” He responded surprised “no way it’s a natural thing why wouldn’t I get them for you!” I still believe that God gives multiple daughters to the Dads who can really handle them and be compassionate. Thanks Ingrid have a fabulous wkend doll!! ~Miranda
I was very glad when you brought up the whole tampons vs. pads, and how people in your life, and in many others lives, shame people who wear pads. I have four older sisters, and the oldest always used to make the typical “diaper” jokes/comments, and as a young girl who got her period it made me feel like I was gross for my choice, so much so that I would buy tampons to make it seem like I used them, and bought pads in secret. I tried the other option, and it just wasn’t for me! Thank you for opening up that topic, because it made me feel a whole lot better about it. I’m 24, have had my period for half of my life now, and I should not be ashamed to use the products and care for myself the way I chose! Thank you, Ingrid 💕
Love this kind of videos, and YES everyone should be interested and informed about period even MEN, I remember back in elementary my teacher ask all the boys to go out of the classroom so she could talk about period to all the girls 😕😕🤷🏻‍♀️
LOVE U INGRID FROM MEXICO 🇲🇽❤️
You are 30 😮 you dont look.it. xx
YES YES YESSSSS
I am now using menstruation panties (and sometimes a cup) - this was the most comfortable period I ever had as well as I had no waste, no irritation... It's such a sustainable option maybe u wanna check out shethinx (international) or kora mikino (Germany/Europe) if you are interested in such a thing - I love it! I also love what they are doing for women and menstruating people as well as making it a topic for everybody.
From 11 years to 50 something.  Not much pain. An Advil and good to go
This video is right on time 🙈
What are pads? I only know pillows now. ;)
I remember we had a tampon and pad talk at school in grade 6 or 7. And the boys thought It was hilarious how big the tampons got in water. Then they started throwing them at each other. They didn't care what they were for. That's one of my favorite sex ed memories lol
I'm quite honest and open about my period now and it doesn't bother me so much, however ngl it still kinda grosses me out haha :')
I think people should feel free to control their periods With whatever product they want to without judgment. I think it’s perfectly fine and not dirty at all that you choose to use pads. However, I personally use tampons like many other people, and I don’t think it’s fair to make others bad for using tampons. You wouldn’t want someone to give you a hard time about using pads, so don’t be a hypocrite. One method is not better than another. 

That’s not really directed at Ingrid but more of the people in these comments.
i literally feel like my period has been the same for the last ten years lol
It's do good to see someone recognize that there are trans guys like me who get their period, since we are brought up in a society in which everyone thinks that it's only women and we're all taught that from a young age. So thanks, nice video, I love how open you are.
I’m glad you’re talking about this. It really helps the stigma for people that get periods. As an nb person, I really appreciated the neutral language around it :) great video. Also, I hate tampons so I’m glad to see someone else that likes pads too.
Turned 30 this year too! 30 flirty and thriving
Ingrid I love watching your period videos, specially when I'm on my period, so I think I will have to re watch this video next month, hahaha.
I just hit the 10 year mark for my period and boy do I wish it was still as painless as when it started. In the past few years, I ended up developing the dysmenorrhea that runs on my mom's side of the family and it leaves me completely out of commission for 2-3 days every month from the pain. If all men got periods, I'm positive there would already be an effective treatment for it, but that's a rant for another day 😂
also why does every movie reference to tampons all the time. celebs only talk about tampons, never about pads. everyone has to wear pads at night unless you're willing to wake up at 2am to change a tampon. I've never understood the pad stigma but its so true?
I had my first period when i was 11, now i am 23 and i still think is gross hahahah' I know its normal and natural, but i think its gross haha' Funny how culture change from country to country. I live in Brasil, and here its more common to use pads than tampons haha' Here a lot of girls are afraid of using tampons. Loved this video. I love when you make these type of videos, talking about life <3
My bf and I have only fought 3 times since we started dating and the first two times were both 2 days before my period came. We were both very hangry. And when we make up we always say that our cycles are synced up because we notice that his emotions tend to go down with mine. Probably because we spend so much time together that we are picking up on what the other person is feeling without realizing.
team pads
Great video Ingrid. I'll show it to my daughter or son one day :).
Menstrual cup?
I had my period when I was 9 years....
BTW...your make up looks great. You look glowing
such great praxis ingrid ily
awe girl ,  you are bold !
Thank you :)
I have 30 also!
I am the same with the pad comment
Ingrid my period hasn't came in over 3 months. I'm a lesbian so I know I'm not pregnant. My Dr put me on progesterone but I had complications with the medication and had to stop it. I'm so worried and stressed out. Do u have any words of advice?
I got my first period on my 12th birthday. It was a scary experience and what was worse is none of my friends had any pads on them. When I asked they looked at me in shock because I didnt ask for a tampon. Ive tried various tampons over the last 16 years and I always go back to pads.Thank You for being so open about using them.
I have PCOS and have only really had regular periods for the past 2 years since my gyn finally diagnosed me. I'm 28 now I first got my period at 13 and it was just never regular. I went to the gynecologist first at 17 and they just thought it was bc I was young and they hadn't regulated yet. So they gave me birth control pills. I stopped taking them about a year later and then would have no period for like a year then bleed for over a month a very heavy period. So for me now that things are finally regular I talk about my period all the time, I never used to experience cramps before and so this was new to me. I really didnt want to go back on birth control (I'm a lesbian so I dont need it) so my gyn did some blood tests and found out I'm also insulin resistant and I take medication for that and that's what finally got my period regulated.
Anyone else on their period rn??
Ingrid, I love how you’re so open about discussing your periods and how they’ve changed over the years. When I first got my period 14 years ago (I’m 25 now), they were very heavy and I had painful cramps. As I’ve gotten older, they’ve gotten regular and a lot less painful (I’m on the pill, so that could be why). Thanks for ending the stigma surrounding periods/female bodily functions.
I’m 30 also, and I’m getting to this point in my life where I get sad thinking about a time when I won’t get my period anymore. I’m not saying I necessarily enjoy it, but it’s just this thing that represents an important stage of womanhood to me that when it’s gone, I’ll miss that time in my life.
My cramps aren't bad since I am on birth control and take Tylenol I use to stay in bed the first whole day but I talk to my doctor and they help me. listen to other women about their period help me with mine
So helpful,for me my period is preety drastically different than it was before... Before the only thing I could use to contain my blood were pads... because that would affect my virginity... Based on what my family , culture and time told me at the time. We all know or should know that is not the case and that the term "virginity " can be a whole conversation within itself. 
Been a subscriber for years... love you keep bringing topics like this it is actually helpful.  :) take care
This is not my first time to hear that, but I'm always surprised when I come across the fact that people in America mainly use tampons. I live in Europe, Serbia, and almost all the girls my age (I'm 18) have never used a tampon, they'd rather avoid swimming and other activities in water than to wear one. It's interesting to see how here where I live, the things you said people were talking about pads apply to tampons and I'm the one trying to explain how they are not dirty or gross.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve never been ashamed of wearing pads. I got really grossed out and uncomfortable about inserting a tampon.
I'am new
Its ok
This is cute, but just wait til you’re 40+! You period may be shorter but then you have cramps for 10+ days before you actually get it, then when you do, you bleed like you killed a small animal! Not to mention the immense mood swings! Peri-menopause is the absolute worst! I have ALWAYS hated my period as it has never served me any purpose other than a monthly inconvenience. I can’t wait for it to be over!
Women (definition: adult human females) are the only ones who experience menstruation. One cannot have periods without a uterus, which is part of a female reproductive system. It's sexist and dishonest to deny this fact when for years women have suffered discrimination and mistreatment because we get periods and we've been deemed "dirty" and "over emotional", etc. because of them. I know Ingrid doesn't mean any harm, but when you make statements like "all genders get periods" it erases the sex-based oppression women have faced for centuries under patriarchy. It's important to protect our language and our biology to come together as women and fight for our rights as biological females.
Yo
So, basically this was just a giant advertisement for the brand Rael.
Drop dairy and you won't have a single cramp again in your life :) that's my "then and now" and so many people have been talking about it. There are loads of scientific evidence about that.
You posted this the day I started my period! Haha
WTF YOURE 30 HOLY CRAP YOU LOOK GOOD?!?!??
Hey Ingrid
Im a pads person too! I used to feel like everyone around me was using tampons but just didnt like them, so I embraced my pad loving life! 😊
OMG. Love you Ingrid, but another period vlog is  making me feel like I'm 12 years old again. This feels like an infor commercial for Rael. I mean in this age girls are getting their periods a lot younger. My twin sisters know all about their periods--- how it effects their minds and bodies and the various products they can use while on their periods. Just my opinion, but the majority of your audience probably is past the "awakening."  This content just isn't interesting or informative. I've watched you since the beginning and I think it would be cool for you to do a couple of vlogs regarding how you've grown as a lesbian woman? How or if you've had to deal with discrimination, being both a woman of color and gay? The art of forgiveness-----  have you mastered this or are you still struggling. These are things my little queer sisters look up to you for a non-bias understanding . Thanks Ingrid!
Everybody tell me "why don't you use tampons ?!" ... because I just want to use pads and that's it, using pads is NOT dirty
I started my period really young at 10 years old. I remember people telling me pads were gross. I couldn’t get that tampon up there at the time. Lol. I mean tampons are just as gross when u think about. U are holding all that in your body. Let’s just say it’s all unpleasant. Lol
I always thought it a curse.   Still do.  Ablation that’s the ticket!
Eeewww les 🤮🤮🤮🤮
You’re slowly getting canceled Ingrid
knowing that only you are in charge of how you manage it was such a big lesson for me!! I used pads up until a couple years ago (I hated them but was pretty uneducated about my own body and tampons terrified me) and I had a boyfriend at the time who thought it was ~so weird~ that I used pads bc they were “for like, 12 year olds” and I was 23. screw that guy for a lot of reasons but mostly that one
Is there a reason you no longer brush your teeth?
Republican men think periods are so dirty and disgusting that they don't even want to hear the word 'period'. Many Republican men I know make their wives/girlfriends sleep on the couch away from them when they have their period! Yes, I'm being serious...
Yea periods are normal bodily function. So isn’t urination and bowel movements. That’s doesn’t mean that it’s always ok to talk about those openly anywhere. Not everyone wants to hear about any of your bodily functions. Guy or girl. You should still try to be considerate that maybe you’re making ppl uncomfortable and ask before bringing it up. Maybe they had a traumatic experience and you might cause a trigger. It’s selfish to assume because you’re okay with it everyone else should be too. No one should HAVE to be feel the same way you do about things. We are all different people.
You lost me when you said not only women have periods
Don't know if you'll see this but after watching this video it is something I want to share. I have been watching you for so long. Probably starting early in high school and this week I finished my junior year of undergrad. I have definitely given into the new type of mindless/chatter content here on Youtube, but there is nothing I appreciate more than you showing your growth, evolution, and maturation through your content and the little lessons of wisdom that come with it. I suppose I just wanted to express my gratitude for continuing to upload genuine and refreshing content. It makes me sad to see that other creators feel discouraged by what youtube is today. I hope to pick up one of your reading recommendations and will definitely listen to that podcast. Learning to value female friendships and have honest conversations about death is something that I have also been faced with recently. Watching this video, I felt comforted and experienced it as catching up with an old friend. Thank you always and so much. Stream of consciousness over lol.
You are the OG of favourites!! Everyone grew up watching these!
LOL I was wondering why Tayto was sitting SO STILL in the background 😂😂😂 then I realised
OMG, is that Ingrid Nilsen or Maia Mitchell !!! They look like twins !!!
That’s nuts I was hoping you uploaded something about nice refreshing, light makeup and skincare.... same wavelength
I will definitely check out that Ted Talk. I’ve lost many people in my life and currently, my mother is dying. Grief never leaves you. It lessens, but it can come back to you unexpectedly. 💕 Thank you for another great video! I appreciate your work.

Edit: I watched the Ted Talk. Thank you for recommending it. I really needed to hear what she said. 💕
Thank you, I needed a reminder that summer is actually coming.
Watching this while it rains like crazy and is 10c in London. What’s summer?
Thank you for being you, Ingrid. You are more than surface and we appreciate it. xx
I love how you started the video with a cold drink = summer vibes 💕🙌🌸🌷☀️
Thank you for sharing about that TED talk! This year marks the 10th year of my dad being gone. He was diagnosed with Mesothelioma when I was 17, and he passed when I was 19. Everything you said, and what I'm sure the TED talk says, describes everything I've felt and captures what I always say that there is no moving on, only moving forward and becoming use to the loss. No one ever seems to understand that and for the past 10 years I still feel so alone. 


Thank you all the other amazing recs, and thanks for being you.
Hi Ingrid, if you would like  to talk  about how  to handle losing  a loved  person ( / a family member) I would  highly  appreciate a video about that.  Thank you for the great content.  Best wishes!
You are legit one woman who I look up to so much. THANK YOU for being you and making everyone here feel loved.
Summer hasn't even started yet? 🙈
What you were saying about grief was beautiful, I’m going to watch that now. Grief, for me, is like a wave; it will always come and go, sometimes it’s soft and easy to manage, sometimes it slams you in the chest, but it’s also a natural part of the world. And important.
Back from the gym, face mask on my face, and Olaplex in my hair... bring on the favorites!
Isn’t it still spring??
I thought the pillow behind you was actually Tayto and I was so confused as to how he was staying so still😂 I’m dumb :/
I loved this video and obviously you! Your current content is amazing, please keep going!!
Ahhhh !!!! A favorites video! It’s been too long!!! Been a fan for 4 years now and I still love all your content :3 Thank you for being you :3
I took a break from this video just to watch Nora and she is amazing. Thank you for sharing!
How old is she?
ANYONE
Love you Ingrid! Also i love love love Tayto!!! He’s so adorable oh my God!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You are just darling!  I'm 48 and love watching your videos.  You a just a joy to watch and give great advice and recommendations!  Lovely.
i also love the bold type! and it actually is based on the former editor-in-chief of cosmopolitan haha
You are the queen of favorites, Ingrid!
It's literally snowing here in Edmonton 🇨🇦 today lmao
THANK YOU for sharing that TED Talk! My dad also died and my experience with people's reactions to that information is pretty much identical. It's always helpful to listen to someone who isn't afraid to go there because grief is a part of us that's so hard to understand.
Ah, the "text me when you get home" part choked me up. I always think of that as a substitute for "I love you".
I have to say, i LOVE every remendation that you do! I have taken notes of those books because they samed so interesting! You're the best! x
Ingrid, I've been watching your videos for a long time. I love how your channel has evolved over the years. Loving the fresh minimalistic makeup. It's refreshing
Yay! Your videos are perfect to unwind from the day. Your positivity and content are awesome.
I seek relationships with people.  Not relationships based on gender, race, religion, etc.
Liane Moriarty is by far my favorite author! Her books are so intriguing.
Fellow Nora super fan here! We can be weird together. ☺️
always love your favorite videos 🙌🏻💗
Glowing in all the ways! ✨💖
Ingrid doing summer favorites video. Meanwhile in finland, it was snowing today. 
Summer where are you!! ;(
I love Ted Talks. Thanks for suggesting one :) . By the way, I love Liane Moriarty as well! She's great
I got into The Bold Type very recently so I'm only on season 1. I just watched the episode where Jayne and Kat offer to be Sutton's safety net last night though and FEELS. I love them.


This all sounded great and I will for sure check out that TED talk. In the meantime, I have a question - is there are picture of Tayto on a pillow behind you? I was like... it looks like him but.. flat?
My mom died when I was 10 and I still deal with it (I’m 27 now.) it’s not something I ever expect to go away, but I do think dealing with it will get easier as I develop the tools and practices to work through my grief.
finally someone talking about gentleman jack!! it's so good!!
Thanks for sharing that TedTalk. My dad also died when I was 17 (almost 3 years ago), and I appreciate your open sharing about your loss and how to deal with it and move forward. I would love to see a video dedicated to talking about loss too.
I loved the book favorites and how you summarized each one of them! Hopefully I’ll read some of them during my summer break❤️
I LOVE INGRID SO MUCH!! She’s such an inspiration to small youtubers!
Gentleman Jack doesn’t come out till late May in Australia!! I’m so excited 😍 especially to see a show centred around a butch lesbian in the 1800s. Anne was a badass
My college English teacher published a book and I haven’t gotten the change to read it all but seems like a good read: What It mean to write by Adrian McKerracher !! ✨✨✨
Loved this video! I’m a huge fan of the Bold Type and just added all those books to my amazon cart!
I have used this brand in the past and it really worked great on my skin.  My skin in yellow (make-up) and very very oily (moisturizer).  I have a hard time finding products.   Great video and great product review.
The packaging on the makeup products is so cute!
You remind me of Mia Mitchell ❤
I've been contemplating those Laura Mercier lipsticks for years... love those colors!
I thought it was real life Tayto,back there 😂
Laura Mercier just sent me some of those lipsticks to try out and I’m even more excited to test them now that I know you love them!
Truly, Madly, Guilty is a serious page turner! Hope you love it 💛
Ingrid thanks so much for the Ted T. I’m newly back to YouTube. That suggestion was really appreciated! Love your channel. All things feminine 💕💕
You're so right about loss, Ingrid. No one ever want to get deep with you about it and it's borderline a taboo topic to even mention or discuss. Along with releasing the stigma of so many other issues, death needs to be included in that seeing as, like you said, we're all going to experience it and people need to be there to listen, support and uplift those dealing with or coping with it! <3
Nice, but I don't really get summer favourites at the beginning of May 🤔 especially when you talk about books that you already read or shows you watched, how are they summer faves when it's not even summer yet 😆 good video anyway, just the title is a bit confusing in my opinion  🙂
I’m here specially for the books! 🤓
OMG i agree with you so much about the glossier highlighters, i really regret getting it, what a waste of money
I also love the  Grief Cast podcast
Urgh when you started talking about the ted talk and grief, it really got me
My mom died 6 years ago now. It was right before i turned 23 
An its true i will never get over it
Everyone needs a mom
Just.... right in the feels 
Thank you, i will definitely be watching that
I love Gentleman Jack!! 😊
Tayto pillow😭❤️❤️
I flipping love Nora!!! Such real and open discussion about grief that typically doesn't happen in our society. I was drawn to it because I lost my dad 18 years ago. Her podcast is also amazing!
Have you seen Transparent? I finally watched it. Such a great show. It has that same "life essence" as like a "Six Feet Under". xo
always waiting for your videos! also just a huge tip especially if skin cancer is a concern definitely switch to mineral sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens are TOXIC and can increase you chance!!! just look it up and do some research and  you’ll be shocked!!
Loved this one 💕
I always add your book recommendations to my amazon wish list, if they're not already there or I haven't yet read them.  I, too, LOVE to read and have a book in my purse, just in case.  I'm going to watch Nora McInerny's Ted talk.  My dad died when I was 7 and more than 25 years later, I can safely say that I have never "gotten over it".
FIRST :D
um, it's not summer yet in NYC...
Yaaay 💖
more like spring favorites...
Nice video just subscribed to your channel.
I’ve been following you since 2013 and I don’t usually leave comments for people, but I just wanted to say Thank you. I have taken so many recommendations from you over the years and have never regretted it once. Your reviews and suggestions are bang on. You are awesome! ☺️ Thank you for being who you are...
Hi Ingrid!  I just want to say thank you for talking about your dad in this video the way you did. My dad died when I was 13, and the 8th anniversary of that day was last week. It brought a lot of the stuff that I've been dealing with since to the forefront of my mind and I get choked up whenever I try to vocalize it, so I usually don't. I've been thinking a lot about how I feel like I can't really talk to anyone about it since I should be "over" it by now, and then you spoke directly to that. I feel so much better having someone acknowledge that it's natural not to be over it. Thank you <3
Truly Madly Guilty was a great book! I love her as well :) I’ve read What Alice Forgot too but I wanna read more of her books!!
I lost my brother in 2015. Nothing has changed in 4 years😥 you are so right♥️ it gets easier but fundamentally it doesn't change, there is no "getting over" or "closure" at all.
❤️
My Dad has been gone for 15yrs! I still think I have got to call Dad and tell him——-!? And then you remember . . . you can’t! I doubt I’ll ever stop wanting call and tell him things!  As ALWAYS! GREAT Video💄✌🏼🤣
hiiiiiiiiiii h r u dear m tara from jaisalmer rajasthan
My dad died when I was 17 as well (11 years ago) and its nice to hear from another person with a similar experience. I still dream about my dad, miss my dad, and get reminded of him almost daily. Sometimes I feel like I should be "over it" but then I stop myself from thinking that way cause of course a big loss like that doesn't just disappear from your life or thoughts. Anyway, I'll have to check out that Ted talk.
Hi, new friend very good video
Summer? 🤔
You look like the girl from the movie last summer I think on Netflix
I read What Alice Forgot and Husband’s Secret on your recommendation from awhile ago and loved them! I think now I’ve read all her books except Hypnotist’s Love Story. Truly Madly Guilty was probably my least favorite of all of hers but I still liked it! Enjoy!
I'm a trans guy, but I'm not out to my family and if I was I don't think they'd let me cut my hair, or dress in a more masculine way, or get a binder, so your videos help me to sort of be able to deal with being forced into a feminine community. It's really great to see a feminine girl in the LGBTQ+ community, if that makes sense, because a lot of lesbians are less feminine. Anyways that was confusing sorry... I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
I love you Ingrid and first like ♥️💗😊
Есть здесь русские??) cool video
Hey Ingrid
Summer is almost 2months away... 😜
Your teeth looks so stained. Maybe it's the lipstick. Bad lipstick color ingrid 🤦‍♀️
I hope you get shot one day
Is there any chance you will change your hairstyle any time soon? I know you love it. I don't (sorry) and that's why i dont enjoy your videos anymore  (sorry) :(.
I'm pretty much out of my Boy Brow and looking to try something new! Which brow gels are you loving right now?
I feel like i’m going back in time with one of your make up tutorials 😂
I love how carefree this video was.  Not staged, scripted or directed like they have kind of felt lately. This one was like the good old days. I love how much you’re maturing and growing, but I also love when you’re most candid like this ❤️ Hoping you go back to vlogging again someday.
"I'm not one to wear a ton of makeup" oh how times have changed lol
I 100% loved the sound effects (including the ones from Tayto) and the candid nature of this tutorial!
THIS is why I subscribed to you years ago! Please bring more of this kind of content back!
I know this really isn't much different from your normal videos, but it felt a little less controlled, and an element of your personality came through that I've missed. Almost the feeling of having an old friend back. You've felt quite inaccessible in your videos, and getting to feel 'connected' to you through this platform is what drew me to you nearly a decade ago. Really love your videos, and I respect your privacy and evolution. Just thought I'd share. 💕
Loved this video and your classic bright lip! You should do a "Favorite Lip Products" video or lip colors for every season :)
That lip color is so pretty 💕 great for summer
I love the simple tutorials you do that don’t require a certain eye shape (hooded or not, almond or round, etc.) or 15 different palettes that are beyond a lot of smaller budgets. Thank you! This look is so pretty and doable!
YASSSS gridmonster is back !!! I misss nuggo appearances so much :(
Yesss perfect timing! I just had a baby in January and will be going back to work on Monday, so I need a quick routine like this in my life 😊👍
Reminiscent of missglamorazzi spring makeup vids. I miss when we were all about makeup
I am sure everybody got a peek at the more carefree Ingrid in this video after a long long time. I loved every second of it.  Please keep them coming, because I just realised that I miss them and there's no replacement for you.
P.S. - that's exactly the kind of makeup I do these days. Definitely going to add a cream highlighter to the mix now.
I loved the touch of goofiness in this video. 💕
You have such a calming aura <3
Tom Ford brow gel(?) is the BEST. Even as the tube runs low, the formula still goes strong and doesn't crackle or fade toward the end.
Just realised I have been watching your videos for so long!  Mmmmmm just needed to say that! Thanks Ingrid! 💗
never thought i was going to love this video as much as i did 💚
A good eyebrow recommendation is... make me brow by essence xx
You are glowing! So pretty!!
This was a lovely video to watch. I really do need to watch u more as u are such a sweet girl & so refreshing. I think I'm just overwhelmed with the big beauty guru's on YouTube lately 🤔 xx
I LOVE INGRID !!! i’ve been watching her from the start and finally started my own channel!!
I’ve been loving all of your content lately! It’s so genuine and authentic :)
Ohhhhh the LM tinted moisturiser is a staple in my foundation wardrobe <3 
hahahaha. Dish soap though. ;D had me cracking up
Can you make a video about what you eat on a daily basis, pleasee ? 
By the way, I'm obsessed with that lip colour 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Such a lovely video Ingrid! It was so calming and informative. I am so glad you’re still killing it with youtube. When I watch your content, I always feel better and more confident. Thank you for doing what you do✨💕
So freaking beautiful 😍😍
I really love these types of videos! Your personality shines bright.
I love this makeup tutorial! You should do more ✨
Brow gel recommendation: Thrive Causemetics Instant-Fix Semi-Permanent Eyebrow Gel !!!
I really miss ur makeup videos ingrid!!😁
You had me repeating that "dish soap" sentence out loud with you and going through the same repetition and amazement of how hard it was for me too lol!
This video made my dog start whining 🤦🏽‍♂️ what excellent guard dogs
This was delightful. Thanks for keeping the bloopers!
Your voice is always so soothing ❤️
So pretty! I love the music too 😊
Loving the muted coral lip!
Loved how natural and funny you were in this vid! ❤️
Your make up tutorials are still a fav to watch. ❤
Beautycounter makes an awesome brow gel also from one Laura Mercia fan to another the beautycounter tint skin is BOMB!
Loved this video, so fun with the bloopers😊
This gave me OG missglamorazzi vibes! Love it!
Love your videos! Would love to see an apartment tour or GRWM!
Ingrid..I love your videos and feels very bad when people start commenting that your videos are not interesting anymore..but you are a very beautiful person inside out...I love you..don’t stop uploading videos because of few comments...there are genuine admirers of you throughout world..keep up the good work and we are all there with you..my first ever comment on any channel till date and only for you..
I am interested in the Highlight Stick, but have a fairer complexion, would you still go with the Pinkie color or the Startle color?
I love your hair clip!! Where did you get it? 😍😘
Is there something going on with her teeth or is my screen off on colour or quality?
Ugh Ingrid you’ve always been one of my fav youtubers! I’ve been watching you literally since I got my channel 10 years ago! You’re amazing ❤️
Who else tried saying “I used dish soap to wash my beauty blender” and realized it is actually quite difficult 😅
This tutorial just made me so happy!!!!
loved this one! Ingrid could you do a video with outfits for spring or summer in the city as you did a few years back!? 🙏🏽🙏🏽pretty please
I’d never complete all theses steps in just 5 mins!!
I like your face honestly that i cannot watch your videos sometimes
Love this look...so easy and pretty
I wish I could use the the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, but they don't make a shade light enough for me.  They start at a darker range!  I do love the eyeshadow stick though, that is my go to.
Really pretty 😊 how do you do the curls on your hair? I have the moment also short hair and don’t really know how to style it 😕
Wow, I miss your more beauty related videos! Minimal makeup and you look wonderful (although you look great without it too). I’m glad to hear your recs, too. We don’t hear them as much anymore 😞
Ingrid, I've watched you for several years now. You have taught me so much about makeup. I have truly learned how to enhance my natural beauty instead of over covering up. I have also learned to love taking care of my skin. Thanks for all the great tutorials and please keep them coming!
I love your new haircut! 100 times better!!!!
Wish I could do all that in 5 min!
How is your hair cut so that it looks fabulous parted in the middle or slightly off to the side?? What is your secret? (Seriously, I'm curious to know, as I'm trying to achieve your fabulous look when I get my hair cut!)
you really do look gorgeous in this look
Such a lovely video, Ingrid! xx
You are so beautiful.
Honestly your skin is so beautiful that you don't need to put makeup at all but you can do that just as tutorial not to enhance your beauty cause it is already naturally enhanced.
Loved this both as a makeup tutorial and also has a fun chatty video! 💗
Ingrid, I would love to see you try some Supergoop products! I currently use their mineral sunscreen and I’m OBSESSED. I would love to see someone else try their other products! Like their CC cream or makeup setting spray! I trust your opinion and would love to know if it’s worth the purchase!
Have you thought about going for a pixie? You have a perfect face shape for any haircut.
This is giving me old school youtube missglamorazzi vibes and i love it.
This turned out so cute!
E.U. has banned around 1400 ingredients from personal care products, and the U.S. has banned a measly 30.
Let’s discuss this
You are beautiful 🌸
The lip color is pretty. Wonderful tutorial.
I love this look easy to follow .
Ughh love this! Reminds me of your old videos!
Great video Ingrid. I love the lip color.
Your skin looks good Ingrid :)
Thumbs up ..done!!!!!♥️
Missed you!
I love this look!
I loved this video!!
Your haircut 😍😍
so fresh ingrid!!!!
So pretty!
❤️
I love your lips
😘❤️😘❤️😘👍
Such beautiful colors!
Nice one!
😘😘😘😘
Great look! But just a tip for anyone who is concerned with wrinkles - try to relax your face while putting on mascara :)
Can you test plastic free make up? Like lip and cheek tints, mascara, etc
Awesome
A lot of comments below pretty much say " liked this video bc its like the old videos"...which means your audience isn't enjoying you lately.   That's what I got out of it
Could you try Whole Foods makeup brands?
Hey Ingrid
It was so fun to watch this w fun sound effect
2:15 without lip coulor you have no upper lip...
I couldn’t believe the amount of potentially harmful ingredients that were in both high-end and drugstore beauty products. As my ingredient research continued, it was even more alarming when I found out that these products contained some ingredients that had been banned from our food.

Omg what happen to your teeth???? They look like brownish nos white 😱😱😱😱
Could you talk about clean green beauty on your channel?
What happened to your teeth?
this is so wholesome and beautiful, I'm in love
"grinch paws"
I just aww'd out loud!
This is how a sponsorship video should be done!
This is the SWEETEST thing I have ever seen. I love you even more for this.  Also, I need a Pomeranian, stat.
CUTEST VIDEO EVER💗
sending love to u and Tayto, from México!
That scene at the end when you two were on the couch made me tear up. 😭🥰 You can feel the love through the screen. 💕
I literally looked like he started smiling, when you said you loved him!😍
Cuteness overload❤❤❤
I love Tayto
You've honestly seemed happier since you've gotten Tayto☺.
I love your content, Ingrid. So wholesome, positive, light, and beautiful...it really speaks volumes about your character. Haha your dog's little howl is so cute!!
Why did I cry towards the end omg too cute 😢
Ahhh my heart is bursting!! I just loved this! What a precious Tayto 💛
Ingrid this was so beautiful! What a wonderful way to celebrate little Tayto and the bond you share.
Am I the only Irish person who read this and thought she meant the crisps? 🇮🇪
This is so sweet! I’ve been watching you for years and I have to ask— does Nugget still live with you? I miss him!
I miss nugget so much please go home to visit him 😭❤️
what a great video, i was emotional the whole way through. perfect sponsorship, perfect pup; what a great story! i'm so glad you two found each other. xoxo from massachusetts
Hands down, your best video. It just reminded me of my relationship with my special pup. I actually cried while watching this because the feeling these beautiful friends brings us is unlike any other 💛 Tayto is a lucky little fellow.
Adorable. I'm gonna go hug my cat now.
Thanks for sharing this love letter. Lots of love to both of you.
Tayto is an Irish Snack Company
What a sweetie!!!!!!! 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️ the dog shelters should show this video as an add for adoption
Omg I totally died at the Grinch Paws thing!!!!! They really do look like Grinch hands 😂😂😂😂☠️
This was so cute wow 😭💗 my heart
I always wondered what happened to Nugget
You are such a thoughtful patience person. Would have never thought of the silicone mat. What a great story. Thanks for sharing.
Ingrid, you're meant to demark sponsored content.
Who wouldn't love Tayto, he's so beautiful and full of spunk! I really enjoyed seeing him and I can see he loves you right back.
Awww, this was so cute! Keep up the wonderful work , Ingrid!😊💕
OMG I love him soooo much!!  His Grinch paws are just the best!! ='D  It's so sad to hear how scared he was of bowls and such!!  Poor buddy. <3
"I just can't believe I get to be his human" had me crying. I love my Tonka and and I know how you feel <3

Thank you, It made my life
This was incredibly sweet 💕  can feel the love from both of you for each other. 👩 🐕 ♥️
What happened to nugget?

Oh my god, your dog Tayto is so adorable! 😊😁👍


I think I might cry during this video lol, adorable! 😭😭😭
I cried. So much love in this video <3
You DO know that Tayto is Northern Ireland's famous brand of crisps (potato chips)?!!!!
OH MY GOSH! I love this video Ingrid! I have a rescue too and can't imagine my life without her. Tayto looks incredibly happy in the city♥️

This is the sweetest freaking thing ever and omg I needed this today and now I just wanna hug Tayto
Grinch toes are my favorite!
I adore you more than ever for making this video, LOL! He is one really stinkin cute fur baby <3
That baby howl made my day! ☺️
This is so cute!! 😭❤️❤️
i loveeee my poms grinchy feet😭😍
Aww Ingrid, this is so sweet!  Tayto is darling!  I feel the same way about my dog.
This is toooooo cute and I love his grinch paws 🐾
Omg this is so adorable!!
Just beautiful 😍
Awww! This is the cutest video ever! U love Tayto like I love my Chihuahua Cinnamon. He is my world!
This broke my heart since my rescue cat just passed away recently after so many happy years with me. She struggled with anxiety and food as well and everything you said I feel so deep in my heart. It's just amazing when the right human finds a pet... I love it.
I don't have a dog, or even a desire to get one (def a cat person) but I still loved this video. :)
Awww !! Tayto is so adorable !!! is melt my heart !!
Such a cute video lots of  love to you both ❤️
What a beautiful video! Thank you for sharing more with us about Tayto! I've had two rescue dogs, and I also find it so deeply meaningful to watch them heal and become themselves, and the courage and insight they've given me for my own healing and growth.
Your dog eats better than I do.
Awe I love this so much!!
This is such a sweet video ! ♥️
Omg! I have a pom too and she always has grinch paws! Thought I was the only one that called it that 😂
Aw I love Tayto! He’s so cute! He seems like such a lovable dog! I’m so happy you rescued him! I love your story with Tayto
What happened to Nugget? Did you get bored with him? Moved on to a new pet? 😒
Just came from that Bill Gates interview you did. I gotta say... You look kinda sickly nowadays. Did you lose a lot of weight? You looked most gorgeous and healthy in the time of that video.
This is a piece of heaven! MY FAVORITE VIDEO SO FAR! Tayto is so lucky to have you!
This was such a sweet video, Ingrid!! Pets are truly the heart and soul of human lives! They just complete us and fulfill us in so many ways!! xo <3
Tayto is so adorable! Love this video! 🥰🐶
Awww, this made me tear up and hug my Bootsie girl closer. Doggos are the best.
Omg he’s soooo cute it looks like he’s smiling, I’m so glad you’ve rescued him.
What a munchkin!!!! Love this
Your videos always my day and your videos inspire me to keep making my videos and trying my best even though I’m pretty new to this and only have 2k!
Sweetest video ever I cried
we really don’t deserve dogs 😍😩
As an Irish girl, I also love Tayto
112.00 for my two dogs every two weeks 😳😳😳
he is adorable.  I have  a pom  and he is so darn cute.  My pom howls too and we always laugh when he does.
Awww this was so sweet 💕
Omg this is the cutest video! Tayto is soooooo cute omg omg omg he is so adorable <3 cant count how many "aww"s i gave out lol
I LOVE YOU TAYTO❤️
This was so sweet!! Your friendship is so wholesome. How come he had anxiety around meal time? I don’t own a dog so I’m a little clueless about these things
The content I'm interested in thank you
Super adorable!!! 💕
this video is the purest thing I've seen in a while
Tayto is Bae-to
Awww the end when he's rubbing his head on yours 🥰
Omg! I'm legit tearing up from how adorable this is! Tayto's personality reminds me so much of my dog! He has grinch paws too no matter what! He's also a very nervous dog too and although he's not afraid of bowls he's afraid of boxes, yoga mats and balls lol. <3 Now please excuse me while I go hug my pup :)
This is adorable.
What a cute little guy.😊❤❤❤
this is the tayto content the people asked for
Awwwww he so cute. and happy
Aaaaawww adorable!!!
Obviously a ad but it’s not posted anywhere, it only says sponsored video in description 😒
I love your Farmer's Dog commercial! It is cute and sweet!
Beautiful dog 😍😍😍😍😍
I have a pomoranien who is also a rescue. I will do everything for her. She has just gotten both her legs opration.
this is so wholesome and cute
Ingrid this is so pure
My dad has worked for tayto for 30 years. I love tayto crisp sandwiches. I even love when they brought out tayto chocolate
6:45 so cute 😭
Your dog is so cute!
OMG 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I miss my labrador ❤
Love this video! My dog shares all of his idiosyncrasies!! ALL. Including the grinch paws and bowl phobia. I ordered the food. I hope it works for Coco too! Greetings Tayto!
Woof woof woof woof, aaaaaaaaooooooooooo.

Woof woof woof woof woof.
What breed is he? So cute 😍
This is why Ingrid Nilsen is the best. She Loves the people (animals) in her life <3
Another sponsored video. As soon as she said this is a very special video, I knew... 😩 Ingrid, can we just see the real video for once?
omg im crying. my dog also has anxiety and is the same with food. we have to put it directly on the ground and make sure the room is silent or he will run and hide. I've tried a mat before, but it had a lip around the edge, I'm definitely going to try a silicone mat like this one! I loved hearing Taytos story!
Rescued animals are so amazing. Their happiness is their way of showing gratitude. I have four rescue animals and they're the kindest, most loving fur babies. If you have some love to give rescue a cat or dog from a shelter. You won't regret it.
Marbles also afraid of bowls lol
i had a pom for 10 years who looked so much like yours. she passed at 10 years old due to some kind of throat cancer. worst day of my life. tayto is so adorable and lucky to have you. and vise versa. Also, welcome to NYC ;)
👋🐶😍
I’m here for this dog content
Ver este anuncio con la base del tema (secreto) cover  Estela Trujillo...... TEMAZO!!!!
Taytooooo ,what a cutie!!!
Stop! I'm going to cry! I have a pomeranian that will be 16 years old next month! He's been with me since I was 13 and has been with me for all my biggest life moments. He even moved states with me twice. He's the love of my life and I couldn't imagine being without him.
We love you Tayto!
dog contents always ftw
Nice to see an exclusive video for Tayto Nilsen 😊😊😊
I teared up a few times... yeah you could say I’m a dog person.
Wow where’s your letter to nugget huh?
I’M CRYING💛💛💛💛
I love this!!! Who are the 35 people that don’t love this!?
He is so sweet 💕💕💕💕
Haha OMG tayto is so freaking cute his little tongue sticking out.
He's so adorable
hahaha so cute!!! love this video! love tayto tooo :)
Is tayto named after Irish tayto crisps?
BEST.VIDEO.EVER.
I love this
So cute 😍
Crying cause I need a dog in my life so bad 💕💕💕💕💕
i cried
Jenna Marbles dog, Marbles, is also afraid of bowls! This phenomena is clearly more widespread than is discussed!!
He’s so cuuuute
This is just so sweet. I have to say I teared up thinking about how he blossomed in your care and how he obviously had some trauma in his past! So glad you have him. My mom adopted a rabbit that was raised to be sold for meat and had had multiple previous owners. When she got her, Clover (the rabbit) was too afraid to let any of us come near her at all.  Now she absolutely loves being petted and will even let us pick her up. It’s so heart warming to see. Thank you for doing this video! I wish the farmers dog had a “the farmers cat” for my cat lol. He’s a very finicky eater.
beautiful
I loved Nugget.
So cute!! Bringing a dog into the family is seriously the best way to learn about yourself. When you can learn to embrace all the weird quirks about another creature, you develop empathy and learn how reinforcement and trusting relationships and patience are the best ways to change behavior for the better. There are always solutions to little problems, but it’s on us to find them. The dogs are just trying to figure out how to live in our world. I find it so important to meet them halfway. This includes exercise, enrichment, good nutrition, and kind training. Since Tayto seems to like the mat, you might want to try the LickiMat. My dogs love them! They’re like silicone potholders with grooves and when I smear food on them, the dogs spend 10+ minutes licking the food out of the grooves. This is great for mental stimulation. Licking tends to be super soothing for anxious dogs too! Both my dogs love them
Where is nugget ☹️
He is so cute😍😍😍😍
Ugh so damn adorbs
Wheres nugget 🙁
❤️❤️❤️
♥️♥️♥️
There aren't many Youtube videos that I'd go back and rewatch but this one made the cut.
My god I’m crying. I love my dog so much and tayto is so cute !
Awe🐾♥️
wtf is the dog named after crisps
Tayto!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕👍👍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍😍🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
So cute
Do you still visit Nugget when you see your mom?
More Tayto videos!!!!!!!
brb crying
Where is nugget?:/
This is beautiful! 😍 but extending our love to all animals is even more awesome
so cute!!
Ingrid, would you be able to do a video on pet ownership/adoption? I think a lot of people don't know the amount of work it takes and it would be nice to hear it from someone who has a dog (and had a cat as well!)
omg that made me cry, that was so sweet, sooo happy for you and tayto. I hope you will consider veganism, animal rights, living in alignment with your values, however you want to put it.... it is who we all are at our core. Thank you for promoting animal adoption and saving sweet tayto. have a lovely weekend! xo
.
This is literally the most ridiculous video I’ve ever seen from you. You’re a grown woman, not a kindergartner.... I’m a pet lover too but I’m not gonna write a love letter about a dog. This is just a “creative idea” for a sponsored video... so all in all, you’re only writing this letter for money... so I guess you’re actually pretty smart, even though this love letter idea is stupid.
When these are exactly the things you need to hear... 💕
Thank ingrid I really needed this video today 💕
MUCH needed video 😘. I put so much pressure on myself and self-sabotage/hate and I need to love myself more in order to thrive and flourish!
I love how real and unique your videos are and you inspire me to keep making videos even though i only have 1k subscribers!
this could not have come at a more perfect time... i've been having SUCH a hard time recently and it's hard to see through that... thank you
Can you please make a video on dealing with envy or jealousy? It would be great😃
im very proud of you and thank you for your knowledge, keep it up girl!!!
I needed this today, was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Thanks Ingrid <3
Ughh Ingrid!!! Somehow you always know what exactly to say! You’re so passionate about the things you talk about, and it makes you really relatable because you hit the right things when talking about or explaining specific subjects. You’re a versatile speaker. That’s really my favorite thing about you. 🖤
I am Miho from Japan!I have been watching your videos for few years for learning things and learning English because your English is very beautiful and clear,also I can learn so many things about life from you.I really appreciate that I found you!!Thank you so much!! ;)
Timing is so weird...I’m currently curled up on my couch feeling completely empty of emotions (not a good sign, right? Haha)..then I saw your instastory about this video. Thank you.
BEST TIMING TO BE ONLINE! Love you so much ❤️❤️
Today was the best day for you to post this for me! I had possibly the worst day/week and was struggling to not beat myself up over it
This video is wonderful, I wrote all of this down. Thank you for sharing Ingrid❤️
self-love is easy on good days but on hard days, it does take a lot of effort
Love, love, love your videos now. You are so relevant. Thank you for such quality content.
I cried through this whole damn video. I desperately need to practice these things. I cannot tell you how freaking much I admire you. I am going to try some of these. I realize I do not treat myself well, but I want to change. Thank you, Ingrid. ❤️
Yesterday was a really rough day for me, and I was really hard on myself. The negative energy is exhausting but ultimately, difficult to let go of, so the entire day I felt weighed down. But I’m so grateful that you have made this video and released it today! The timing is so perfect, and your message is so comforting. These practices are exactly what I needed and am going to run off to practice. Thank you, Ingrid! ♥️
This video was totally needed,  thank you Ingrid. Can't wait for more videos!
so true. should focus more on the victories i believe not the victories that other people value. simple words but truly a good vid! thanks ingrid
This could not have come on a better day. Thank you.
You are really the wonder, miracle. I love you 💕 Thanks for advice! 
P.S. Hi from Russia ☺️
i remember miss glamorrazzi ❤ 2014 - 2015 was a magical year
can you please do a video on getting older and how to deal with that? i find it so hard
A few years ago my boyfriend at the time had to work on my birthday so I decided to go to the movies by myself. I saw a comedy and wow was it liberating to enjoy my own company. I'm now married but I still go on semi-regular solo dates.
Sei bellissima  Ingrid Nilsen 🌼🌼🌼🌈🌈🌈
This video came at the perfect time for me. Thank you, Ingrid!
My dog had to be put down today. My 21st birthday was yesterday which makes it so much harder 💔 but this video made me feel like maybe things could be okay again, so thank you Ingrid ❤
Every video you put out lately has taught me something new and incredibly valuable! Thank you so much for putting that kind of content into the world. You’re honest, thoughtful energy is something I always look forward to!
I'm saving this video so I can keep coming back to it. There is something inspiring, soothing and uplifting about it, and that's what's really needed on really hard days.
This felt very real and genuine, which is refreshing for a video on this topic. I think that you acknowledging your struggles and at the same time acknowledging that you’re trying really helped. Good video!
Thank you for making this video! <3 Listening to you, I already feel better about myself
This was a beautiful video. Thank you so much for making it ❤️
Love the frequent uploads, Ingrid!😊💕
“Your energy is your most important resource” <— this really spoke to me. Thank you ❤️
I think I failed my APUSH test today, so this video is much needed. Love u ingrid!
This video is so beautiful and necessary, I’m working hard on loving myself and this video is extremely helpful. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH, INGRID! ♥️

I love this type of content so real and inspiring. Please do more 😘
Ah Ingrid you’re such a special blessing to this world!❤️
Thank you! 💕
I really needed this today. ☺️
Wow, I was just needing a video like this today and so glad that I was able to see this in my subscription box!
I love this style of video. This is exactly the type of mindfulness/self-help/self-love content I like to see: these concepts made real and tangible so they can be easily implemented in my own life. Thanks, Ingrid! ❤️
I loved this video and it reminded me of the awesome content from your podcast, I miss that a lot! ❤️
Thank you for this video I needed to hear this especially I been feeling overwhelmed  lately and I'm trying to get back on track an Truly Love Myself one day at a time ..

I found this video hugely helpful, and I'm going to save it to a playlist for later. Thank you so much for sharing 💜
Thank you so much for this video! Exactly what I needed right now!!!
Thank you! Very helpfull video. It sounds like common sense, then again, it's not common practice. Thanks for reminding me! Love it!
it's a constant battle in my head with self love... back and forth  and always a work in progress
I need your wisdom, BE MY MOTHER
thank you for posting this video, I am working on coming back from a bad month and this video offered good advice :D
Thanks, Ingrid, knew I followed you for a reason. My mindset has instantly changed my mindset (literally with these tips).
There's so much out for their self love thats so abstract and not practical or relatable and you made it so simple, easy. Thank you. I really needed this
im literally in my 2nd week to Artist Way! Watching this video is really a sign for me to pat myself in the back and continue. Thanks Ingrid!
Love this video. So helpful ❤️Xx

U must be turning to physic. Physic turn to all of these. Your dad is around u he wants to connect with u. Quiet your mind. Lots of love to you x
I love those channels where they make self love videos not just hauls. We’re just facing too much pressure and anxiety in today’s society
Thank you - I ended up pausing the vid here and there so I could do a couple of these immediately and I feel so much better and more like myself. Sending you much love and light, dear. xx
I miss you, Ingrid! Thank you for always being here even when I haven’t. I love you girl. I hope I meet you one day!
Love these real tangible tips!! Very hard some days to get out of the rut in your head.
I needed this video 💜 thank you Ingrid
Watching on my self care Sunday. Much needed
Hey Ingrid! I just want to say that I can see how much thought you have put into these tips, and how you really mean what you say. Personally, those tips really resonated with me and I hope to remember them in the future! So... basically just want to say that I think your video is great and I really value what you say :)
you are such a beautiful person inside and out, ingrid! i love how you've grown over the years and i am very thankful that you share your story with us :)
All of the info from this video was so, so relevant to how I’m feeling right now. Thank you 💗
This is honestly the perfect time for this video. I've been in a bad place for a few days now and this was so good to hear and I'm hoping thanks to this video I will be able to get back to my usual, happy me. Love your videos so much! 💞
Ingrid, I really needed this! I love you so much!
Love these videos from you! Love from Israel ❤️
You’re such a lovely woman. Thank you for this video 💜 there’s a lot of us that need this.
Healthy relationship habits video??? Thankful for your videos <33
1. This is my favorite content from you, ever. I feel like this, and social issues (equality, diversity, women, LGBTQIA+), is where you REALLY shine. Like, literally. Your eyes sparkle a bit more when you talk to us about the issues close to your heart.
2. This was some serious food for thought. I realized that I need to generate more victories in my life, so that's going to be something I'm going to do more actively. Girl, you da best.
I love how your videos put good into the world and try to make a difference. It's so refreshing after seeing haul after haul and beauty routine after beauty routine. I love how even when you do haul videos or routines, you do them in a way that's wholesome and not materialistic! Keep it up sista!  :)
I whole heartedly recommend taking a course in mindful self-compassion. It really helped me to open my heart to all the parts of me I struggle to embrace ... one gentle step at a time.
That was awesome, thank you veeery much! 🌷
癌でしたか・・新保は背骨3度手術しましたが、Front Feet Swimming でほゞ完治。FFS若返りが期待出来ますから是非試してください！新保ism
Great video. Thank you! 😘
I always want to watch her videos. But it takes her sooo long to get to her point. So many pauses and so many unnecessary “philosophisizing”. She is great though. Just.so.slow.
I don't know how you do it Ingrid, but you always post self care/love videos at times when I need them most. thank you
So helpful. Thank you 😊
Ingrid. I adore you. I am always so blown away by your concise thoughts and your beautiful delivery. Love the "taking yourself on dates" idea no matter whether you are in a relationship or not. I find I do this when I travel but need to incorporate this in everyday life. ❤️ Sending you so much love.
Inspiring video, Ingrid. Thank you
ILY
I really appreciate this video so much, I can’t wait to try some of these out! ❤️
I love this video, much needed, you have no idea <3 Thank you <3
I’ve been looking for real, tangible steps to cultivate self-love. This is so helpful. Thank you!
Self compassion is a struggle for me still.
I loved this video because I can relate. Very uplifting to know there are easy tools all around us. Sometimes just starting is the hardest part. I struggle with negative self-talk and am working on it also.
Listening to u calm my nerves. I love u Ingrid.
Ingrid please do a video on your journey or experience with therapy and psychology. I have a complicated situation that I know I can’t fix on my own, by talking to friends and family, it’s been on for years. For the stigma around mental health and psychology and psychiatry I have avoided going but I have come to terms with it and just need a little push
I feel like I need to watch this video every day, because right now, every day feels like a hard day. Thank you Ingrid!
I really needed this tonight. Thanks Ingrid 💜
Levain cookies and a walk through Central Park sounds like an awesome self love date!
I didn't know how much I needed this... I've been in and out of a depressive episode over the course of the last few months and I really needed ideas of how to love myself during the depression.
what i needed today, thank you so so much Ingrid
Ingrid, I have been a subscriber for years and I truly love how your channel has evolved, and I can honestly say that I love your videos now more than ever. I needed this video so much today, so thank you for putting this out into the world. Please don't stop making videos like this, you add SUCH value to the YouTube community.
Hi, I’ve been watching your videos for a long time and wondering if you gonna vlog or shoot videos outside sometimes? Mostly sit down and talk videos and want to see you outside your room sometimes. Hope I’m not too direct but this is my honest opinion/question. Thank you!!
you remind me of emilia clarke
this video was such perfect timing for the headspace i’m in rn thank you ingrid <3
love your hair cut by the way.
How good was that cookie tho =-O
Loved this video Ingrid 🌸 the people pleaser in me needed this. I think often the self love videos or ideas are too ambiguous, but you talk from your own experience and give examples and exercises which are different though helpful. Definitely going to try some out. Thank you and have an amazing day 🧡
Every time I fall way too far and feel hopeless, I find myself coming to your channel and watching videos such as this even if they may not directly relate to the underlying issues I am facing. It's been 3 years now that I have been doing this.  These videos have such a positive and refreshing energy to them that I suppose they have become my "falling back on" thing. I can depend on them to calm me down, help me untangle my turbulent mind. Your voice is so soft and gentle that it adds to the calm vibe. Watching videos like this from you is so refreshing that I can only describe it as "soul-cleansing." Thank you, Ingrid. Much love. <3
I'm in a relationship now in my life. Do you have any advice if this person could be the one? Could you make your video for your thoughts?
That's it, I am taking myself on dates!!! #everythingsucksrightnow
Really needed this today. Thanks ❤️❤️
You are getting less views but you are getting much better Ingrid, thank you for these kinda videos. Unfortunately majority of people want to see gossip/make up/ or easy watching videos but this is the real deal, and watching this is self love for me. This gets me quality information and I love it. Thank you again, loves 💕🌸
You know I'm subscribe to your channel i even not see your videos
this is so practical, thank you
THANK YOU!!!!! You’re not alone! I also felt like a lot of, “love yourself” quotes, photos, etc were so vague! Or if they weren’t vague they had ideas like doing a face mask for self care or going for a walk. While those are great ideas and baby steps towards caring for yourself - in a way it doesn’t get to the root of where that love stems from. I am saving this! Thank you thank you thank you!
I will appreciate you If there are subtitles in the video
Ingrid♡♡♡♡I love you♡♡♡Please do a perfume collection next please
Love this! ❤️
your videos are fantastic, rich in content to give inspiration to face everyday life
You are so right.
You have such great content on your channel, but this video, by far, has been the best video I’ve watched.  This was a much needed self love action for me, because I realized watching this to learn more about self love was loving on me. Thank you, Ingrid.
Love love this 😍💜💜
Thank you for the reminder, Ingrid. We all have challenging days so building the toolkits to help us react in ways that doesn’t take energy away from us is so important. Celebrate the wins (big or small) and practice gratefulness.
yasss.. love thyself!
Hi Ingrid. This video fits perfectly well into my life right now and I am so happy I decided to spend those 8 minutes listening to real advice, things that you've decided to share with everybody. Thank you so much for that. I am also really inspired by how your channel and your content has changed over the past couple of years. I really feel that now every time I watch your videos it is like listening to a real person (that must sound weird). Hope you're having a good weekend!
So timely❤️
love this #moreselflove 🙌🏻🙈
Thank you 💕
Love and appreciate the direction your channel has taken
I love your second tip! I was recently re-listening to the episode of LWL when you mention not wanting to work with a brand that didn't practice what they preached because it would mean betraying your ideals. This is such a powerful way to think because it means aligning yourself with who you really want to be. There's less of a disparity between your real self and your ideal self.
The thing with saying yes and no is it can be tricky, if you are depressive (clinically) what will help you won't be something you would want to say yes to
Hi Ingrid, did you end up bringing your car to NYC with you? (:
I’ve had this video saved in my watch later playlist for a day where I really needed to hear this message. This video was such a good reminder of how far I have come in my own mental health and self love journey. The last few days I have fallen into old patterns, but this video really helped me this morning to get out of bed and do those small acts that help me. Thank you so much Ingrid 💕
You look like Maia Mitchell 😱
LOVE videos like this xoxo
I would love to see a video expanding more on the idea of getting in touch with your inner child. I've been on that journey recently, and I don't think people talk about it enough. I think being out of touch with my inner child is a huge reason why I don't think of myself as creative. Thoughts?
thank u cutiee😍
Ingrid.. Please.. You are so much better than this.. I really dont want to see you gone from youtube but if u keep doing what u are doing now u’ll eventually probably will and i really dont want that to happen.. u used to be so inspiring, creative n happy n i know u still are but somtehing really hold u back n i hope u will lose that ‘something’ very very soon.. i love you so much ingrid n i really want to see u even more successful because u really deserve it.. much love..
Thank you! ♥️
Dear Ingrid, Hi! I watch you for over 3 years now, and i see how you have grown as a person, as a women. How you change, and make changes around you and inside. I just wanted to thank you for making videos and being here as you are. I wish you a lot of love for yourself and this world and please don`t stop making videos that help and develop people!!! WIth Love from Belarus!
I love how you include your own personal goals and thoughts and affirmations, it's such a nice touch especially when we put Youtubers on this pedestal like they don't have the same struggles and insecurities we all have! And it says a lot that you're willing to be vulnerable like that in front of so many people. Thanks for being who you are Ingrid, we love you!
❤️
❤️
Thank you!
Where can I get that shirt?
Ingrid is like a big sister who gives good advice and inspires you and you can look up to her!
please write a book
i just want to share a lil victory of mine... so i was like really sad today and it hasn't come to my mind even once to cut,it used to be one of the first things that would come to my mind.And after 4  months being clean it's the first time that happened so yeah....
Very good suggestions. 😊❤
Levain chocolate chip cookies are all sorts of self love
I have seriously needed a video like this. Thank you Ingrid for being so vulnerable with us, and teaching us how to liberate ourselves from our inner saboteurs.
YES thank you! I resonated deeply about the part about personal victories vs perceived victories. So often the world around me thinks I am at a high, where I am actually at a low and the other way around. Or they might think "Wow she is doing an internship at this really amazing company!" and I actually feel much more happy and proud about the fact, that I had the guts to apply and be vulnerable to rejection. I hope you get the point that I am trying to get across. I write in a gratitude journal and keep also track of all my personal victories, as little as they may seem at first glance. That is very important to me because most of the time people won't notice these and won't know how important it was to me and so that is my way to acknowledge myself. Examples for my personal victories are: hoovering my whole apartment every Sunday,  going grocery shopping and preparing wonderful wholesome meals for myself, telling a friend about a new gallery exhibition and asking her to come with me, going to a restaurant on my own etc.
Love this video!
I feel like it’s hard to love myself cuz I’m like genuinely really ugly :(. And it’s just hard watching all these really beautiful, talented people saying love yourself. Because I’m like “well that’s easy for you to say!”
I’m always depressed it’s hard for me to love myself 😭
I really needed this.. I’ll try, no promises though. Honestly, I don’t know how others can think these sound easy, I’m not even in a really negative space and they feel overwhelming and difficult. 😔
What happened to nugget
Just can't believe you would any negative thoughts about yourself
Video suggestion! Since summer is coming, a lot of people are going to be making some major moves. Can you please post a video on your moving/packing tips for cross country moves? Thanks you’re the best!

After reading some of your insecurities, I wanted to discuss your need to be relevant. I’m assuming this is because of your online community started to dwindle after the last few years. I could be wrong, it could be due to a lot of other things but if it is hear me out. Your content has changed a lot, for the better. Your online presences may be less but you are actually putting quality content and in turn you have quality followers. Instead of falling into trends, you are producing content that betters yourself and your followers, and your videos have spurred a lot of self growth for me, like learning how to stand up for myself. While you might not be relevant in YouTube standards, a lot of quality people aren’t, and the people that are currently relevant won’t be in a few years. You promote change while others promote superficial content.

Hi Ingrid, I love the evolution you’re taking focusing on a more sustainable lifestyle. It is a different direction from your earlier years and I think is a great reflection that you can always start to change and not just be stuck in an ultra consumeristic loop, you can be happier when you shop less and when you shop to be more mindful with what you buy. I’ve been watching your videos for years and have undertaking the same change of direction myself. Keep doing what your doing it’s great : )
I’ve been watching your channel for years and I love your evolving vibe. I think you’re really maturing and coming into your own. 

Can I suggest you start doing videos focused on experiences? Maybe an “Ingrid Tries Something New” series? You could take a ceramics class, or go to a rock climbing gym, or learn how to make pasta, etc. The possibilities are endless.
I’m so glad you are taking a conscious stance in shopping in general. So many of the long-time Youtubers did not evolve with their audiences and I just grew out of their rut.
Great video, but here’s the thing with thread up...That Old Navy jumpsuit was 25$ second hand.  I could buy it new in store on the clearance rack for 8$.
I so feel you on being more fearless with clothes as you get older. I've always loved fashion, but now I pretty much only care about how what I'm wearing makes me feel and not about what other people might think of it. Awesome feeling.
I thought it was so refreshing that she wasn’t flashing all the high end brands that she was pairing with the thrifted finds. I could tell it was an intentional choice and I totally love how un-materialistic she has become esp. in this society.
Thank you, Ingrid! Your videos are always so great and positive :)
Your energy is so positive and radiant ❤️ Makes me happy to just be able to be a part of that!
I love that second hand shopping is becoming more popular! Yay for the environment✨💓
I buy regularly from ThredUP, like Ingrid I have a list of things I want and I have saved searches and I frequently check for those items. I highly recommend it! Most of the things I’ve gotten looked brand new and never worn. My suggestion with thredUP is to buy from brands that you already know how they fit you, and order up a size in some styles (you don’t know if it was washed and dried). If Madewell doesn’t fit you in the store when new, it’s not going to fit you secondhand and you’ll be disappointed. I also research each piece of clothing before I buy it to see if I can find pictures online of people wearing them so I can see how they fit. A lot of people complain about the price on thredUP, but you have to remember that it’s a consignment site with expensive clothing. So for example, the frye boots I bought used were $100 but that’s a third of the price they would be New and they looked like they had barely been worn!  Frye is going to be an expensive brand even when used.
Loving the frequent uploads lately, Ingrid! Keep up the wonderful work as always!😊💕
Can I just say, I find so much joy in watching your style! The idea that less frivolous spending actually taps you into a more "personally styled" wardrobe is so key, and you do it so well! I would love to hear how you think your style has evolved since you moved to New York!
Love that one of the non-profits they work with is Girls Inc! I teach a domestic violence prevention program (among other similar outreach programs) for them and it makes such a huge difference to the girls.  We also collect business clothing for the high school girls and gift them interview outfits when they start looking for internships and for college admission interviews.
Love all these outfits, and love thredUP! <3 

Please do a hair tutorial! I love your hair in this.
I have that Loft romper! I’ve had it for years and I love it. Solid choice!! 😂❤️
Her voice is so relaxing 😌
Honestly, I’ve never had success on Thread Up. I use Vinted regularly and find way better items on there. I’m willing to dig to find the gold on Vinted, which is why I think I like it the best. It’s also the most affordable. Poshmark is good too to find specific items you’re looking for like items from a specific brand and style, but I don’t use it as regularly.

Thought I’d share in case anyone was interested.
I’ve been interested in looking at thredUP!! I’ve really been trying to buy less fast fashion this year, and buy less in general, and it has felt so good! But when I do need to buy, I’m trying to be very selective
Second hand is my thing 😎 
These r some great finds ~ esp your tea dress. ❤️❤️❤️ is perfect with those sleeves👌
Your CC isn’t working on your videos 😞
I really enjoyed this video, great looks for affordable prices!!! Can you please take 2 minutes and share the lip colors that you wear here!! You are so well put together!
You're gorgeous!!! Which is the model of the Nike shoes?!
So good to see you looking more glam and spruced up. LOVE how you've styled these (especially the first two 😍)
Is ThredUP international?
I'm so in love with that first outfit! And insanely jealous of your beautiful apartment. I live in NY and girl I know the apartment hunting struggle. Hope you're doing great, keep up the great videos!
It makes me so happy when you upload Ingrid! I loved this video ❤️
I've probably been watching your channel for a while now, I'm kind of obsessed (ahhh help me!) I love how open you are and I love your personality! I love you so much Ingrid! I'm glad that I subscribed to your channel! Can't wait to see you become one of most famous people ever!
Have a good day, Ingrid! 
Xoxo, Divya💕
these conscious shopping videos are my favourite videos you make! i purchased some skirts on thredup following this video - thanks for the inspo :)
Thanks Ingrid! Your voice is so relaxing and love your positive vibes :)
So classy, so fun! So ingrid.💛✨
I literally need to up the speed on all her videos cause she talks so DAMN SLOW LMAO
More clothes/fashion videos. You have great style. This video was fun! 🧡💛💚
Yay! Really enjoyed this video from you. :-)
I’ve been binging your “Ingrid Dishes” segments on Pop Sugar, and I wish you would do more cooking videos! I love watching them and want to try all of them! You have a knack for cooking, and I’m always looking for new recipes that my husband will enjoy.
Lol uh oh. Now I'm on thredUP when I should be working...
Love you Ingrid! PS . IDK why during the 2nd outfit I just got the random idea that your walking out of frame look a like a lot to the wey The Grinch walks lol
Hey Ingrid! I love this video! You are so cute! I would LOOOVE if you could include the makeup you used! It looks so great! THANKS!!😘
I love this journey you've been on Ingrid, and the 30% discount!
You look gorgeous today! Greetings from Italy 🇮🇹
I literally love all of these outfits, so cute nd comfy!
Yes!!!!!! Love this!!!! Please do more videos like the shop your closet vids from a couple years ago!!
Aww! The star sweater reminds me of baby ingrid during the early days of vlogmas! 😊
I love the yellow dress❤️😍looks beautiful
i particualry was so excited by your shoes, and especially your white pointy flats... those could be very harmful if you kick somebody...
 even though some guys would love to try it...hehehe
LOVE those red belt buckle flats!!!
I'm living for how excited Ingrid is about the dealz she got
I love your make up! What are you wearing?
Can you do more videos like this please!
That was so much fun to watch! Colors really do look good on you, Ingrid! / I really enjoyed the whole concept of this video. If you are wondering if you should make more videos like this one, I am sure many of us would be happy to see them ! xx
thank you for showing a wider range of price points in your thrifting this time!! i always enjoyed your previous ones, but it's just nice to see you wearing old navy haha.
I NEED that jacket!!! <3
Thank you Ingrid! I love this!!!
Thanks for this opportunity to try ThreadUp at a discount Ingrid.  Unfortunately, when I filled my cart and tried to check out, it would not accept my order because they didn't accept my Canadian postal code.  Help! :)
I never find such cute things on there! This gives me hope lol. You look amazing in those outfits. I died over the first three 😍
I have that jumpsuit already and I love it!
One thing that I worry about when secondhand shopping is if I wear my new thrifted clothing, will I bump into the previous owners? 😂😂 maybe it’s just my social anxiety
Wish they ship to Switzerland! Can you please feedback to them? :)
This video was so well done! I love the mix of thriving tips with the styling ideas ❤️. I will have to try Thred Up because I want to get into thrifting. I just hate digging through all the clothes in person.
been waiting 2 years for just a fashion video
Sooo many good buys, OMG! :D <3
That floral jumpsuit is so so cute 😍😍
I have a crush on you ingrid. I love you. Much love from Peru
These are all SO my style!!! Love this
Thank you .. just checked out ThredUp and found some fun items.
I buy nearly all my clothing (and many other things) thrifted and half of the reason beside reusing, uniqueness and quality is because it’s economical. So though I love the reusing nature of this, man, a great deal is still paying $45 ?? 😧😧
I CANNOT GET OVER how much I love that you are a YouTuber that switched from hauls of new clothes to second hand shopping. I know there are youtubers that started their channels second hand, and the youtubers that bought new clothes and still do it.. but you've exposed way more people by going from one to the other!! Props to you.
I can't stand how "stinkin" cute you are :DDD
Great pieces!  I especially love the dress with the puffy touching sleeves!
U r sooooo cute and adorable. :(💛💛💛
Thank you for this! I’ve recently been learning about ethical and sustainable clothing buying options, so this video came at the perfect time for me. 💕 Also, I just love that for all the years I’ve watched you, you’ve embraced your adorable, quirky self.
Every Pieces of you choosed that so perfect on you, i love it all.
Your intro was way to long, we get it you second hand shopped on thread up, a 4 minute intro is redundant!
I LOVE that Old Navy jumpsuit! The way you styled it actually reminds me of an outfit I wore obsessively as an early teen so I'm now filled with so much nostalgia! :) You've inspired me to find that jumpsuit (or a similar one) so I can recreate that outfit, with my current, more "grown-up" style.
I LOVE thredUP! It's like all the fun of thrift shopping but I'm on my couch drinking wine instead of spending a day going to a bunch of different shops.
Love it ! Thanks Ingrid.
I love the Koral leggings and outfit 5!! So cute, casual and comfy!! 3 of my favorite style hits!
Love these outfit ideas videos, I did a vid like this on my channel and I will definitely do more ❤️❤️❤️
Love the outfits ideas💕💕💕
I have the dress version of the jumpsuit you bought
thredUP does't ship to the UK. :(  Are there any other sites you recommend that do ship to the UK?
Ingrid, I love your springy videos!
These outfits are all so cute and you inspire me to keep making videos even though I only have 1k!
We love a sustainable Queen!!!
love you but i hate thredup
you did restyling and second hand videos? did i miss them? lol
Yay more second hand videos!!!!
Idk why this sponsorship seemed fake. You're really not into the clothes.
Ingrid, how does one contact your business?
I quite like this one.
The word favourite is so disturbing, you said it like zillion times..
Love Thred Up. I’m lucky to be just a couple of miles from their PA warehouse, so they have a small retail store there!
❤️
What foundation are you wearing???
Clothes are still expensive D:
I love Thredup!
💖💖💖👍
I honestly never liked second hand shopping because I found the stores disorganized and stuff everywhere opposed to a retail store where they have all the same shirts on the same hooks, etc. I am trying to be more sustainable and have started going back into secondhand shops and I just had to learn patience to be in there!
Minute 8:16 😹😹😍😍😍😍 you’re so stinking cute!!!!!
love this video!!
Hi everyone 🙂🙂🙂🙂
I’ve heard about this brand so much but they don’t deliver to England! Devastated haha
The yellow dress suits you so well!
😊👍
Amazing video! Your recent content about style and clothing has been so inspiring and I'm so glad to see you talking about the environmental side too! And also your happiness just shines through and that makes the videos so nice to watch!
😘😘😘
The yellow dress !!!! 😍
No konečně něco jiného než ta neustálá kosmetika. Chci trendy 2019 styl. Díky
I have frye boots in  very good condition size 7 that I’m going to list in Poshmark shop @aneema under $90, Madewell and other nice brands like Madewell, free people, Topshop check it out.
Hey Ingrid can you do an update video and how its been since you came out lesbian on youtube and how things have been with your faith too etc. Also how can straight people like myself help in this process:) thanks!:)
Alguém do Brazilian
Cute 🥰
Love this idea for a video. The clothes seem quite expensive for second hand though!
I thought you said on your Instagram stories that you weren’t buying more clothes.
All of your shoes are weird.... not really wearable
Very cute clothes. I do hope you shave your legs though. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I deleted the instagram app a few days ago. I feel more productive now and don't procrastinate by watching memes all day when I'm bored, instead I try to do something that's gonna give me value in life. It felt empty at the beginning but after some time I got used to it. On rare occasions I might log in on the ig website so see what's up, but overall I think its a great way of trying to learn to stay out of social media.
just delete FB and IG. I've never been happier.
I completely deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. My life is much better without all of the "brain-cluttering" of social media. Youtube can also be toxic of course, but I use it carefully.
I am so sad that so many people are not watching her videos :( she has nearly 4 million subs but only 70k views per video
I love these tips! I've been trying to monitor my screen time on the phone and set alarms to remind myself to get off and do something else!
Ok not gonna lie.. I always think of spring cleaning as literally cleaning my house.. but like it makes more sense to do it to my devices as well.. so glad I watched this 🖤
YES! I love this! I have clinical depression, and one thing that really keeps me in a downward cycle is clutter...whether it’s physical clutter in my space, or a cluttered iPad. 
I also find notifications anxiety producing, so I have those turned off except for iMessage or FaceTime which only I have my kids, my husband and my dad on. I’m ALWAYS available for them. 
As far as social media, I have Facebook for a very small number of family and friends (less than 25 people) and I have Instagram for a very small, carefully curated number of people I enjoy following. I try to make sure the people I follow bring light, happiness and positivity into my life. Since I’ve really cleaned out my digital space and social media I’ve found my anxiety and depression is a lot more manageable because I’m filling my brain with positivity. 
I also like your idea of scheduling time for certain digital activities. I’m current in trying to establish a daily routine/schedule and this was on my list! 
Thank you for your content. I learn so much from you and it’s nice to have someone who sees some things the way I do...it helps me not feel so alone. 💕
This is so good. I was just talking with some mid-twenties girls my age and I truly believe Instagram, and other social media outlets can be such a thief of joy. When I am feeling myself experiencing negative thoughts (especially comparing my life and self to others), I altogether delete the app and give my mind a break. I read a book, listen to old music, or find something that makes me happy. With so much negativity out there, you can find so much peace when you just disconnect.
I am curious how you deal (have dealt) with fomo, you may have touched on in it in this video and I missed it. I know doing more things outside, without involving your phone so much does help. But in those, slower moments (especially, if you are somewhere by yourself and are wanting to avoid human interaction due to low social energy levels -- I'm an introvert so I definitely use my phone to avoid socializing when I need to), how do you combat the fomo that does arise from not checking or looking at your favorite social media accounts? I do feel I put too much weight on some accounts, expecting them to always help me feel better or inspire me. It's a difficult avenue to navigate sometimes when you do feel that at least with a few accounts, you want to keep up with what they're doing or working on because you feel that you are 'somewhat' friends with them and want to support them. I guess it is a form of letting go, and reevaluating what's actually important enough in the grand scheme of things for your life to spend so much time checking up on people you don't really know in real life.


Anyway, thank you for making this video and doing this spring cleaning series! This year has felt very different for me and from the beginning of it I have been wanting to purge a lot of bad habits and practices as well as material things that have not aided in a healthy lifestyle. As well as continuing to try to pay more attention and be more intentional about the life I live, what I do with it, as well as what and who I bring into it and what I use and how much of it I use. So thank you! Videos like these are very helpful and motivating!
Love your energy! Thanks for the information. I've been learning how to better hone in on this in my own social media and this definitely is helpful.
Really appreciated all the thought you've put in this video, Ingrid! I love that your content reflects the choices you've made -- it's substantial, meaningful, while all still being creative :) Side note, I just deleted about 7 apps from my phone and it was the best feeling ever, haha.
I haven’t had three social media platforms for nearly 2 years now and oh my GOODNESS it has thankfully helped me with my depression.... like drastically . 
Thank you for this video it gave me complete reassurance on my own thoughts towards social media and how I SHOULD properly utilize them.
Such a good topic.  You make very interesting points here Ingrid! I 'm obsessed  with your haircut by the way, so cute!
I’ve been working on implementing a lot of these things in my life over the last month and it’s been helping me a lot but you’ve added some other tips that I definitely need to work on as well especially being there for everyone 24/7
I live in this super strict hostel where they collect our phones at around 8 pm in the evening. Though most people including me have 2 phones, one to submit, one to keep, I have tried submitting my phone on a few days and it felt great. Makes me feel free and independent. Watching your video makes me want to submit my phone every evening and not depend so much on it. Thanks, In. 💛
From all the lifestyle / beauty influencers I follow, Ingrid you have grown the most and shown so much resilience that the average person cannot imagine having. Your content is evolved and mature and beyond just being a walking human ad and I want to let you know how much I appreciate that.
I only have an Instagram, I deleted my Facebook a year and a half ago and honestly couldn’t be happier. I don’t compare myself to other people’s posts featuring cherry picked details of their lives, I’m not tempted to stalk exes (we’ve all done it), and I don’t see people spread and believe outright false information. I only keep an Instagram to see photos of my friend’s and sister’s kids. I also turned off notifications on my personal phone. I have a work phone that has to be on all the time because I work on-call. Close friends and family have that number in case of emergency. I wish I didn’t have to keep my phone on a night, but people have to be able to reach me 24/7 most weeks for work reasons.
Stopped watching this video to do something creative now. You're good, Ingrid!

Your advice is always so actionable and clear! Thanks for the tips. 🙏🏼
I spend to much time on YouTube but it's my drug, I'm lost without it! 😭😭😭


I still get out and hangout with family though! 😁👍
Ingrid, I love your message of connectivity to the world and yourself. I love being connected to the world around me more than social media...because then when I do choose to hop on for a bit, I feel connected there, rather than mindless! Loved this video and the thoughtfulness it carries. Being mindfully loving towards yourself can be scary sometimes...or a lot of the time. But I'm finding the world doesn't end when you choose to connect to yourself as you are; it only gets brighter! ✨
Being away of social media make u relax and not comparing yourself and pressure yourself ...it happens even indirectly
I normally don't share videos but I had to share this one. Maybe some friends need these tips. I just turned off my IG/FB/YT notifications. I think this is going to help me a lot. All the time I see a notification, I want to look what it is and I stop the work I was doing. The bedroom rule is really hard for me. I check my phone before sleeping and when I wake up. However, I don't think I would like to change that, at least for now hehe 
Thank you for the video. It was very helpful and inspiring.
can you do an updated glossier video? they came out with new products and i really liked your last review
Goals. Is this why you don’t respond on Marco Polo anymore? 😂
Can you do a spring clean montage video Please!!!!!!!
just deleted a LOAD of apps from my phone after watching this. hopefully I can start using my time more productively. Even when it comes down to non-productive things like Netflix I have a tendency to scroll through Facebook or Instagram and not really pay attention in the first place. Recently started crocheting instead. Far better to have something creative as a distraction than just another half an hour wasted looking at IG stories.
I've been watching your channel for several years now. Thank you for making such genuine, positive content! This video was very inspirational and a great reminder to focus on what matters most.
I am working on reducing my screen time as well and this is so helpful! 
I love how your content has changed as you grow and as I feel that YouTube is less and less relative to the life I want to have I still love watching your videos 💞
I was just thinking about how to have a "social media cleanse" if you will because of how much social media takes over my life and comprises the time I use. This is so important to understand now! Thanks so much for making the amazing content you do 💛
OMG I NEEDED THIS VIDEO!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Luv u ingrid. This was just what i needed. Mucho amor from Puerto Rico ❤️❤️❤️
Watching you for over 8 years and you’re at your peak! Love your content 😇
You articulated these things so well. Thank you for sharing your practices and thoughts! xx
Support to independent and against the current thinking 💭 A life examined and analysed is worth living!
This is an amazing and helpful video! My screen time is way too high and I really need to reevaluate my dependency with my phone :(((
This video is much appreciated. Our sanity will be improved if we take these steps. Thank you Ingrid. ☀️🌿
Bless your sweet, beautiful, intentional heart. I appreciate you!
I’ve been slowly implementing all her tips over the past year and they really do work!! I feel more productive and honestly happier
Thank you it was really helpful.I feel exactly the same way. Thank you for talking you are an inspiration!
Needed this! Thank you for your consistently inspiring content Ingrid
This is something I definitely have started doing over the past few months. I don't something unless it's something I 💯 agree with or love. Thank you!
Your videos are so qualitative and thoughtful!!!😍😍😍 Thank you, this is what I need rn!
Thank you , this video it's very benefic for me
❤❤❤
i love your content so much! always makes me think or question and learn more about myself, in both small and big ways
I want your vlogs!!! I love your vids so much♥
Ooh! I've been recently thinking about my relationship to social media since I noticed that I was using it as a coping mechanism for loneliness. Thanks for this video! :)
Fewer viewers but those of us still left genuinely care and are interested ❤️
Social media is so powerful. As powerful of a tool as it is, we shouldn't waste our lives spending hours on social media. Thanks for sharing!
When you spoke about this previously I meant to ask you about emergency calls and texts. I know you keep your phone out of the bedroom, but what about those times when people need to reach you for emergencies. Do you worry about missing those calls/txts. I’ve considered taking on this practice, but the thought of missing a call that could be life or death scares me. What are your thoughts on this?
Thank you. This video is very useful for me now!  Well, more realistic life.
Love these tips, Ingrid!! ❤️
Thank you for this, Ingrid. I have been stuck in a funk - completely uninspired and I find myself drowning my sorrows away through the mindless distraction of social media. I'm truly loving your content lately! I've been subscribed to you since your MissGlamorazzi days and it's so refreshing to see how much you've grown throughout the years. Thank you for the inspiration! <3
Love how mindful you are of so many topics and how you are moving into a more intentional vs passive life! You made great points and definitely inspired me to so some phone de-cluttering and overthink some of my mindless habits.
I need tips on how to use it more !! The grass is always greener lol
I used to want to buy so many products and felt satisfied with the number. But recently I rather have a limited amount of true favorites than 100+ average cosmetics/ clothing / bags that I can’t use up or love.
So I am glad that someone almost my age has shifted kinda same way and showing how great it is.
Thank you Ingrid♥️♥️
Please please pleeeease Give us your makeup/skin care routine! You look amazing
I really needed this. Thankyou sooo much Ingrid!!<3
I love the idea of using social media in an active way
to all this girly girls out there I think you might like yay youtube channel
I needed this video. Thank you.
Great video, Ingrid! I especially like the ideas of putting positive boundaries in order to share meaningful things which we actually care about and of using social media actively! 
I've been trying to implement these ideas in my own life and even though it's still a work in progress I gotta say I feel so much better!

I strongly believe that social media and internet in general are such an amazing tool that our generation can use for incredible, empowering and useful things (even entertaiment on a certain level) and it would be pretty stupid to consider them evil, but we have to be really careful about not losing our humanity. I think this video is really important because, as you said, this is not about perfection but about questioning our habits and what actually fulfills us and makes us human.
Social media are a tool and have to stay like this: I think the limit is crossed when we disconnect from real life and live a virtual life that does not actually gives us anything valuable and, even worse, makes us run away from our actual problems or discomfortable situations.
I love this video, I have been struggling with screen time these are some good tips
This is such a great video. Being more intentional overall is what I’m working on right now, and this definitely helps
Love this message! Thank you ❤️
i actually just decided yesterday that i wanted to start using my phone less haha! thank you for this video!
This is a really nice video, talking about a big problem in the modern world. It is the first time in a while I have watched your videos, but I am so happy that I watched this one. Hope you are well!
Yes! Just what we need to hear for our overall wellness and beauty. 🤗🙏
I gave up instagram, twitter, and snapchat for Lent, and it has changed my life!
I always feel like I get something positive out of your videos and come away (trying) to act in a more thoughtful way 💛
im super glad you have the privelege to do this, but a lot of spoonie and differently abled people really dont have a choice but to get our human interaction through the internet, what tips would you give for us?
Truely inspiring thx Ingrid 💕
The feeling of being stuck and down whilst getting in a hole of social media is something I really relate to. I have never heard anyone else talk about it in this way and I totally agree. As someone that struggles with depression, it can be all to easy to get sucked in and not deal with thoughts/emotions.
Thank you for this! I bought a book called The Power is Habit to start retraining my brain to not only rely on my phone for entertainment. This video came at a really good time for me 😊 love you girl!
I was just telling friends last night that I’ve been using social media less!! (With the exception of some occasional YouTube :) )
I for sure need to work on this!
I really love your deep videos! I deleted my social media 1,5 years ago. Since the I’m feeling so “free” and calm. For me it works, I don’t need social media. Also I have an App on my phone that tracks my screen time. It’s very helpful to be aware of the time (sometimes literally hours) we waste online. Now I try to be more in the presence, live in the moment. Live is so much more than a picture you can post and get a like. Actually it’s more precious and valuable when you have moments just with yourself and noone knows  about it.

Please stay as you are and make more videos that make us viewers reflect their behavior. Love that you use your reach to spread this kind of content💕
I just want to say that this is why I subscribed to you. This kind of content is what I love
Great video thank you ❤️❤️❤️ 
Happy weekend
You are a really big inspiration and role model for me at the moment :)
loving this thoughtful and mature content!!! 😍😍😍
Too bad my corporate job emails/calls/texts me 24/7, and clients message me all hours for my photography business! My phone is literally my life line for my income 😓
But we do learn new things from social media as well.
One youtuber that has always been unproblematic
Love this so much!! Xx
Love this video. I love the direction your content is going! <3 Growing with each other.
I’d rather use more social media
This week specifically I became very conscious about the ridiculous amount of time I spend on my phone so this video comes at the perfect time
this was such a incredible and helpful
omg she's small, shes cute, talks like a middle aged woman, and has crazy eyes. marry me? 😭
I've been doing all of these things for a while now and I find it really valuable and rewarding! I still have social media, but I definitely don't use it as often or I use it intentionally. If I find myself wasting time, I log off.
Really love this video! Have felt drawn in 2019 to really disconnect from social media & technology in certain areas. ❤️
❤️ love your videos, Ingrid. You are such a light! 💜
I would highly recommend reading Make Time by Jake Knapp! It describes exactly what you’re talking about here, which is awesome 👏 and a great read.
I've been noticing more and more how addicted I am to social media. It becomes difficult to resist checking it, so I deleted Instagram and Twitter apps from my phone and just check them on my computer a couple times a day instead of several times an hour. The difference is incredible. It's especially jarring to see the way it affects children. They are literally addicted. I can't wait for the anti-screen revolution.
You are a lovely human, Ingrid. xoxxo
Thats so true❤️ sometimes i dont want a smartphone anymore...
i dont use any social media besides youtube, and although sometimes i feel a bit isolated, it’s honestly quite freeing. allows me to focus on what I want to more!
I spend about 7(!) hours a day in social networks and so on. In general my real life is full of events&meetings, I have a range of goals to achieve. Nevertheless, I started to feel that I do things in real life in order to share them online. My online life became more important which can't but disappoint me. The worst feeling ever:( but i'll try to deal with it using your advice. Thank you for this video and sharing your experience♥️
Posted 21 seconds ago woah
I've been thinking about my phone usage a lot lately. I live with my partner and often after dinner we will sit on the couch together just scrolling for up to an hour. It's awful. I'm very interested in this idea of using social media actively. I'm not exactly sure what it means but I will do more research!
Where’s your phone cover from? ♥️
I was used to be swiping, posting and looking through social media 24/7 but recently I've change that and it make me feel different and good about it. But since I started working, I found out that I'm using my phone to not look that I'm lonely and really just to avoid connecting with people surrounding me, especially at work. I rather looking down than up. This video teach me one thing or two, I will try to change and take a different direction. ily 💗
Aka STOP WATCHING YA VIDEOS CUZ THEY ARE TOO ADICTIVE. LOVE SOCIAL MEDIA
I turned off all notifications except for the essentials. That's a step.
I Loved the tips, I Loved the video❤
I had a huge sense of relief when I understood that 99.9% of the notifications (text, email, bank, social media etc)  are not urgent and that they don't need my full atention at all times. Instead, I've blocked one hour every day to go through my apps, bank account etc
Such an inspiration ☀️
I think whatsapp is the worst because i get too overwhelmed by friends collegegues etc
please never stop youtubing because many of your videos are thoughtful. this video makes me thinking of deleting facebook.. etc..
Great video and much needed in today’s world
The "no tech im the bedroom" is a very good idea. My sleep schedule was ruined for years of being always stimulated by technology in bed or even watching television. Earlier this year I took all the technology out of my room. I still miss it, but I think it's working.
Hi Ingrid! I completely understand you. I deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts about a year ago and I feel way better. You don't realise until you actually give it a try with an open mind. I enjoy my life much more without it just because I focus better in real-life experiences than in my "digital" life.
Love these tips!
Yes girl! One of my new year’s resolutions was no technology after 9 pm. That gives me a two hour window from 9 pm - 11 pm before bed to read, spend time with my partner and my pets, have a bath, etc. It’s really relaxing and has helped me both fall asleep easier and stay asleep throughout the night. I charge my tech in the living room and don’t look at it until I’m out the door to work! Absolutely life changing.
I love this content.
I love this content.
I really really love this and I appreciate how thought-provoking it was. 
I was never aware of the stress and pressure put on me by social media AND my digital life until a few months ago. when I realized the pressure existed, it was like a weight was lifted from me and ever since then, I've been working on ways to help myself by using devices less and in smarter ways. these ideas and tips are really important to spread to more people since most people don't even know that this is a problem in their life that they may WANT to "spring clean".
I’m so early wow
Ingrid why you don’t use ear wears and nail polishes
Less social media? Can’t relate.
Ahh! I loved this video! I’ve been really trying to lessen the “tech addiction” and I really appreciate having the people I seek out online work towards creating content that’s worth my time, rather than continuously posting to keep my attention. It’s far more enjoyable to carve out time every week to sit down and watch your videos than it is to scroll and endlessly consume! Thank you so much for this and for caring more about what you put out than having my eyes on it.
Ingrid this video is so inspiring to me. As a Realtor, I'm constantly on the phone and worried about if I'm missing out on a client calling and needing me. Sometimes I just have to turn my phone off and leave it in my car (like today) just so I don't feel tempted to continually look at it. Its a challenge!
Thank you =)
I had been home from work for two hours and realised I hadn't properly taken my eyes off a screen. I was in the bath, scrolling, and came across this video. Shamed myself into putting my phone down and I enjoyed a bit of me time properly. Thank you. It will be a long process but I'm hoping to break this addiction.
I enjoy parts of this, but I think it’s a specific privilege to be able to completely disconnect at night. If you have kids or people in your life who are medically fragile you need to be able to be reachable at all times because emergencies happen much of the time. 

I do love the active vs passive time on social media and turning off notifications for the elective stuff on my phone!
Thanks a lot for this amazing video! You really made me think more clearly about this subject. I’m struggling with this "problem" since a few months and I felt like, no one on social media talks about that and in real live not at all. 
I turned off my notifications since already a year and it was the best decision I made to get a little bit more out of the social media world. I don’t want to be completely offline and not use any social networks anymore, but I want to use it more activity, like you said. And I think, you made me huge strong relating to that. Social media is amazing, it really has a lot of good sides, but it blocks me still (even if I have turned off my notifications) so many times, from being productive. Ans every one, who knows me, even just a bit, I love being productive and that just makes me feel sooo much better. 
In our society, you mostly (especially in Germany) get judged, if you started doing anything new or if you decided for yourself and your own health, to stop doing something. I think that really sad, because that’s not the way, to achieve better solutions. 
Thanks a lot, Ingrid!
i need to know how to do this makeup look in a tutorial.ha!
I absolutely adore your content Ingrid. I feel (weirdly) that I’ve grown up with you. I used to love all your hauls when I was 18-19 and now as a 24 year old, I feel like you give me so much adulting advice in this new technology world and in life in general. 
I appreciate you and your growth 🌟
I so admire how you’ve changed over the years. It’s incredible how true you are being to yourself and you’re a true role model for women of all ages. You’ve seemingly found this inner peace and love that REALLY shines through and makes me so happy to watch your videos. Love you!
I gave up social media for lent. I’m not religious but, some catholic habits die hard. I’ve found these last couple weeks to be very freeing. The first few days were hard, I missed that dopamine hit I got from checking my phone. But, like you said, I was using it passively and not intentionally. I know some could say this is also a social media platform but, I only have YouTube playing when I’m getting ready in the morning. And, I only comment when I feel like I have something to say to the creator. Thank you for posting this. I think it’s time we all use social media more thoughtfully and intentionally.
I'm super proud of your evolution, Ingrid :)
I did this a while ago but I muted everyone I knew personally (on instagram, both stories & posts. any other site I never followed those people) because it made me feel terrible about myself and extremely uncomfortable. And oh my lord, best decision I've ever made. I felt so much more comfortable when I went through instagram. And then I started muting stories for a lot of people because it bugs me to see all the stories i haven't watched and it quickly became an excessive waste of time. I don't post a lot anymore either just because I have nothing I want to document. I talk to my friends a lot online and run a community so deleting apps isn't something I really can or want to do but I do try to be mindful of when I'm falling down a hole. (twitter is a bad place for me so I've tried very hard to limit how much time I go on twitter. Same with the explore page on instagram)
Hi Ingrid, how are you?
I love this so much
I was having a crap day, feeling down and sorry for myself and this video turned my day around. I think I’ve been spending too much time on my phone and this video has shifted my perspective. I hope you continue to make content like this in the future. Thanks Ingrid!
Ingrid, I really appreciate you making this video because using social media too much is something I struggle with and it’s such a time suck for me. Your advice is really helpful and I liked hearing how you’ve been able to implement these changes in your life. Thank you ❤️
Great video Ingrid!
love u ingrid
I'm trying to spend less money so I recently deleted all the delivery apps on my phone and it feels great!
Very very helpful
❤️
Isn’t this an oxymoron? Isn’t You Tube just one more app taking up ones time? Wake up people! It’s ALL a distraction.
I have a question for either Ingrid or anyone reading this! How do I stop getting frustrated with my boyfriend using his phone all the time? I feel like it stresses me out because I know that when I’m always on my phone that I’m not fully present but he doesn’t see it that way. I have trouble letting go of things that he does for himself that I don’t agree with for myself because I feel like they’re affecting him the way they’re affecting me but logically I know that what works for one does not work for everyone. Thanks :)
💖💖💖
This is so helpful - thank you Ingrid. Implementing some of these tips after experiencing a downward spiral of horrible feelings while scrolling and more mindless scrolling. I have a bad habit of looking at my phone right before going to sleep and that's something I'm going to change this week.
I need this
I unfollowed a lot of IG accounts that I followed for no reason, unfriended people on Facebook I actually wasn't friends with, and unsubscribed from YT channels I never watch and it has cut my phone time down a bunch. I like seeing just what I want to see instead of hundreds of things I continually skipped over!
Such good content. I just came back to social media after giving it up for lent. I learned so much about myself during that break. I completely agree that you don’t have to share everything & it has taken me a long time to learn that as well. I think I was worried that if I didn’t then people would think I was boring. Either way - thank you for your meaningful videos. I’ve been watching your channel since 2011ish and it’s been a delight to watch you grow. Thanks, Ingrid!
I love the face you make in your thumbnail. It really does prove that you have thought about and 'created' this video's content as opposed to simply making a face everyone else is also pulling as their thumbnails. Most people will pull the dramatically-surprised face with a lot of hashtags or colorful subheadings on it. Or they pull the extatically smiling face which you see on so many videos that it has just become boring and unrelated to the content, really. So thumbs up for you, Ingrid. Thanks for another great video! :)
I’m trying to like this as many times as I can! I’ve been using all these strategies for about 6 weeks now and it’s been HUGE! Thank you for this, Ingrid! I’m curious to know what kind of alarm clock you use without your phone in your room. Do you also eliminate TVs from your bedroom? Does Netflix count? Lol
Ilysm , Ingrid!🤗💞
Hey Ingrid, I reckon you would love the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport if you haven't read it already! It's about basically everything you've talked about in this video, but there's a really interesting history and psychology element to it as well :)
I’m going to start deleting apps right now and see if I feel any less cluttered. 🙏
My daughter is so like Ingrid. She is also not allowed to take a phone and a laptop in the bedroom. She is only 5 years old ;)
You look like that hot Australian actor.. In orange is the new black
I have been using Facebook since it started, way back in 2004 and I quit Facebook in November of last year. Simply because I was no longer regularly using it. It used to be a big part of my life and the easiest way to keep in touch with most of my friends. I don't know how long it's been but maybe in the recent 1-2 years, I have noticed myself just straying away from Facebook. I think it's annoying how now everyone is using it, it's become strangely toxic. So I decided to fight back the system and delete it altogether. Ingrid, you have no idea how cathartic it felt to just deactivate my account without turning back. I have been Facebook free since then. While yes I do miss the group messages and FB invites but unless someone reaches out (which rarely anyone does because they complain I'm not on it), I don't mind the quietness. I don't miss it. I have also recently started spring cleaning my 'followers' on IG. You know what I've also noticed? Using IG less & less, including when I go on my breaks at work. I tuck my phone away, listen to music and just admire my surroundings. It's become my new life approach and I am more appreciative of just putting my phone away and looking up from my screen. I love this video and I just had to post something as soon as I saw the title (and I hardly post!)! Keep making great content whenever you can! :)
Am I the only straight guy who watches this channel?
Lovin’ that thumbnail. Ya u go sis!
Hey Ingrid
her hair like that reminds me of the poop emoji. not flattering unfortunately.
"Like" if you remember the old "what's in my bathroom" video.
Can I just say, I don't know how you got the sound to be this good in a bathroom!
I love videos like this! Cleaning and organizing videos are something I will watch for hours on end! 🤣🤣 💕
I honestly don’t understand how you use up all of this product so fast, that’s one in depth skin care routine!
Super loved this video! Feels so old school YouTube which is really catching my attention lately! Also, the editing was A+ 💙💙
Love this video! I don't know why but it kind of reminds me of your old videos for some reason. ❤️
:: Nooooooooo!! You can’t put coffee grounds down the drain omg literally the worst thing you can do 🚫🚫🚫 Switch to salt and sugar, does the job without the expensive plumbing fiasco ✔️
I love your channel so much and you motivate me to keep making videos even though I’m new to youtube and don’t have many subscribers💓
I just bought the frank body coffee scrub at ulta yesterday! I used it last night and I am obsessed! <3
your videos are always so cleansing and inspiring, they always make me want to put myself first and respect my space if that makes sense!! love u <33
I was about to ask about your lipstick when you mentioned it 😁 it's gooooorgeous, and looks stunning on you!
Hi Ingrid!
Mix the nimrah face pack with rose water instead of regular water for better results.
Love from India ❤
I've been loving the frequent uploads so much from you lately , Ingrid. Keep up the wonderful work as always girl! Stay smiling!😊💗
I don’t think there are even enough hours in the day to use all those products.  Maybe not even in a week.
Awesome, Do you recommend and CHEAP but GOOD products for beginners to skincare? (You guys in the comments can pitch in too if you'd like)
I want to point out that it is so so good you use up all the products instead of switching them out and throwing them away!💘
You should do more of the skincare videos😍😍😍😍
I'm already loving this series!!!
You should seriously try Honie Crushed products if you like Frank Body
Love this series Ingrid, can't wait for the next one ❤️
Would love some more makeup tutorials and skincare routine videos ☺️✌🏼⭐️🌸
I tried your code for the scrubs but they didn’t work :(
You use some really interesting products I've never seen before,  Looking into them!  :)
Already absolutely loving this spring cleaning series! Exited to see the rest of it!! 💕
I am on the Spring cleaning spree too, so your videos couldn't have come at a better time. I did my beauty, makeup, most of digital.. and some real cleaning of doors, windows and bathroom. Excited for next video!
Yasss I love this! Thank you 🙏
Where is the cleaning tho
A regular person can’t afford to have that many skin care products
What is happening with your teeth?  I m worried
Loved the video!  I always wanted to watch a five minute body scrub commercial. Thx
I LOVE all the sweet chef serums! The beet one is my favorite right now!
Wow!! Very good to see Kama Ayurveda in your collection 😃
I'm Iranian. We celebrate nowruz in spring and before that we clean all the house😬.I didn't know that other people in other countries do this too
pink dior lip product? reminds me of when you used to always wear sari pink back in like 2012. i have been around for like 7 years now, jesus christ.
super excited for more of these videos!
I really wish you would go cruelty free.
I’m laughing so hard at the Chantecaille. 

“BYE.”
LOVE the idea behind this series! I love your skincare videos most, and I always appreciate your honesty. I missed seeing these kinds of videos on your channel, and judging from the other comments here, I’m glad I’m not the only one who missed them. Thanks for sharing, Ingrid! And yes, that lipstick looks so lovely on you! ☺️
Love the descriptions of the products you use for spring. Helpful. Thank you!
I really love the idea behind this video! I love the message of cleaning/organizing/simplifying/reducing with all the mini skincare product reviews!
Im going to WE day next week and I'm so excited to see you! Today I found out I'm going and I looked at the people coming list. I saw you and looked you up, now I think you are one of my favorite youtubers and I'm so excited to see you!!
I like how 80% of the products you use, are from Eastern Countries. Like South Korea, Japan, & even India! So Cool! Really enjoyed this type of format, very informative. :D
where are the bathroom cup/shelves from?? theyre so cute!
There’s a lot of fragrance in these products, I’d recommend looking up the dangers of fragrance and lack of jurisdiction on what goes into personal care products. It’s really scary.
So motivating and helpful!! Thanks Ingrid! ❤️
I love your polka-dot socks, so do you change all your products every season or something? I'm kind of new here! 😅
Love the way you filmed this.. what you're taking out and what you're replacing it with!
That arm is going to be reeeeeeally raw if she keeps using exfoliating products on the same area. 😂
That serum that you love that is super expensive is at Sephora for like less than half the price. I think it’s $130.
can you do a review/update on the Sweet Chef products? I really want to know what you think of them!!
Ingrid, I love your videos. My question is how do you budget your skincare purchase. Just wondering! Thanks for the videos
holy shit u use soo many skincare products i would get so overwhelmed
Like you , i adore beauty products :) Bisous !
Love this idea for a series!
So happy to be in your routine year round, Ingrid! 💘💘
I feel like almost all of these products would give me contact dermatitis. #sensitiveskin
Shelfie goals! 😍💜
love these types of videos! 😍👌🏼
Ugh your New York apartment 😍 goals one day.  I live in a shoebox way uptown hahaha. Love your videos Ingrid!
You have got incredible knowlwdge in this video.
You are so inspiring ❤️
Do you find that the coffee scrubs clog your drain?
This video was so satisfying. I need to start my spring cleaning RIGHT NOW. 10:00 Friday night!! Big things are happening
idk Ingrid, I just love this video!!!
Can you do a video on body acne?
How old are you? You look like 20 to me and for that reason I don't think you need to use all that cosmetics...
Where are your shower bucket shelves from?! Love them!
yay💛💛
Who's erica?
i enjoyed this so muchhh
I use some of these products in my own skincare routine and absolutely agree with your opinions! Maybe we have the same skintype. But videos like these make it hard to trust your opinions on sponsored videos (especially with Simple Skincare) since they're from a different price point and don't appear anywhere in your daily routine. I'm all for influencers partnering with a brand they love and would use regarless of sponsorship. But recommending Simple Skincare when your bathroom is filled with these types of products is laughable at best.
Loved this video :D
I Loved the video❤
Thanks for the Make p:rem sunscreen suggestion! I HATE the smell of regular sunscreen, and I find that a lot of moisturizers with high SPF still have the faintest sunscreen odor. But not the Make p:rem, I use the body sunscreen on my face and body, and I love it!
ingrid is so LA lmfao, the way she says maharaja..... im indian
💜✨
Why do you look like my form tutor in school lOl
where is that makeup blush makeup bag from :D?
I am shocked that you- such a kind hearted and wonderful person wouldn’t choose to go cruelty free? A lot of the products already are, and you would only have to cut out some things I don’t get why you wouldn’t make that change.
I know only 2% will see thattt😍 ❤️ 




Your gonna have great luck for 2019 łïké this comment and šùbśćríbê to me to activate.
pray for the New Zealand victims 💔💔
Cute 💛💛 I just posted a clean with me video as well on a CRAZY SNOW DAY!!! ❄❄❄
I can’t wait for the next video!!
Love that vase, I’m pretty sure it’s WestElm. I’ve thought about buying it a million times.
wow kama ayurveda
Ingrid, I used to watch you so much when I was younger. Now that I am older I have started my own channel. Thank you for inspiring me!
Very interesting to me how you're a feminist and anti-patriarchy, yet you're promoting a company (Frank Body) whose product descriptions are spoken from a womanizing man's (Frank) vantage point, sexualizing women, saying things like "Guess what? You'll be naked in a minute" and constantly calling women "babes"... it just seems extremely hypocritical.
What in the advertisement...
Wow.... you use A LOT of stuff. How do you know what works and what doesn't if you use so many things at the same time???? 
Also, how come you started talking in that weird voice that kourney kardashian uses.
How do you keep your shelves in the cabinet clean? My glass shelves get sooo dusty and it’s a daily annoyance for me, cause I don’t want to take everything off of them every day to clean.. 😒
Your teeth? Why are they like that all of a sudden.. are you a smoker?
Love spring cleaning videos. It's amazing how much in the home can get neglected with regular cleaning routines.
Cruelty free????
How do you use so many skincare products at once? Putting that much on your face at once can’t be healthy, plus most of the products contain fragrance. Ladies! You don’t need this many products to look beautiful.😂🤣
YOUR SO BEAUTIFUL AHHHHHHHH I LOVE YOU SO MUCH INGRID <<<<<<<<33333333333
So...basically you're just switching products :) not really cleaning anything :) kinda bs
Hey Ingrid
bruh too many expensive products that I've never heard of (????)
Cant be bothered to watch it if its not cruelty free
I painted that picture of nugget for you in 2013 and I can’t believe you still have it! That’s amazing and just made my life.
Ingrid, I have to say I'm so happy that you are starting to open up a little bit to us again. I felt that for a while you shied away alot from sharing which is why you introducing Erica to us and showing us your work space really gave me the old classic Ingrid content that I missed so much. I think it's that hint of personal touch that I liked. Thank you.
I really love how youtubers from 7-9 years ago are sharing their creative spaces and you can see the sentimental items from their career. It tells a lot about how they value their subscribers and the achievements they have pursued. 

Personally at my desk jobs I never felt like decorating my area to much because I was worried about becoming too comfortable and having to leave. But now I feel like when you personalize your space with sentimental items it can be more of an encouragement and creative inspiration. I don’t have a desk job now but I love my work and enjoy making my home spaces feel comfortable and creative. 

Love your space Ingrid, thank you for sharing!
I'm so curious how you make up your budget for your lifestyle in NYC. I've seen a lot of people posting how astronomical rent is in the city, so hopefully you can do a video on how you tackle your finances!
It's perfect, Ingrid! You inspire me to live, to work, to dress up and to be happy 💖
I 100% relate to never feeling like your living space is “done.” I’ve been putting off filming an apartment tour for weeks because I feel like it’s not “ready” yet, but I’ll probably never feel like it’s ready, so I should just embrace that and make the video!
i still remember you having your dad's paintings in your blue bedroom in your um's home all those years ago. wow, i've been around for a while.
Off topic, but I got my Jo Malone Ingrid’s Perfect Pair solid fragrance in the mail yesterday! I would have never put those fragrances together but I love it. People in my office have been asking me what fragrance I’m wearing all day because it’s the perfect balance of spicy and feminine. I bought 2 so I could keep one at home and one at work! Had to snag 2 before they sold out...
Thanks for the tour, Ingrid! Love your creativity. 💕
Can I ask what happened to nugget? haven't seen him in any of ur vids recently :(
You actually seem to happy lately. Feels like you have found Your Place here in life. I'm really happy for you and kind of proud that you are half Norwegian ^^ Love from Norway <3
I really liked this video. Also...Pusheen is life. 😉💕
Ingrid, you're a badass ALWAYS. Happy International Women's Day!!!! Thank you for always being an impressively real, powerful boss-woman!!! ❤️ 🧡 💛
I love your desk, especially the highlights on your shelf! 🐱❤️
Love how you've organized the space! How much space does the folded bed/mattress take up and how do you store it?
Lovely space!! Sweet little additions. And I want more videos with Tayto. He's precious!
Oh my gosh. You are so cute. 😍

Also, it looks great.
that foldable bed is dope! is it comfortable?
This is so satisfying to look at! 🖤
Please do a book collection video!!! 😍🙏🏼
How do i smell you through my phone?

Edit: you have an essence of flowerbomb
WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING TO ALEXA, MY ALEXA WENT OFF AND STARTED TELLING ME WHATS UP
Perfectly functional and personal space! Love the room.
Office looks amazing
That bed was the mic drop lol. Love it
random memory but i'll never forget walking around the mall in my town and seeing your face on a poster for Bare Minerals! i was so excited to see you working with a company i loved as well as getting recognition for all your hard work <3
Came for some home office/guest room inspo but love love love your highlights. So personable and inspiring =)
How beatiful your office, Happy woman's day, i loved the video❤
Ah I love your office tours😍
i hope you are doing okay ingrid, you look a bit more brighter if that makes sense, thank you for sharing your life with us💜
Love the office/guest room set up! Your wallpaper was a genius idea. I can't wait to have my own space so I can customize my wall as well.
will you election in Thailand too?
 may I ask?


coming soon on 24 March 2019
Thanks for the tour! You have been such an inspiring figure for me over the last couple of years, and I still enjoy watching your videos and getting motivation from you just as much as I used to back in 2016. Sending love!
Nice to see Nugget again at least in a painting & photo.
So great to see you like that Ingrid 😍 I can see you feel good and happy , plus you look stunning girl and the room is GOALS
This video was great. I love the simplicity of your space. It’s not all “done up” or “forced,” it’s a sweet space that pays homage to some really good memories of yours. Thanks for sharing this, and I miss seeing you open up to us. I know I love it ❤️
I love this space, it's really beautiful, and the bed looks so amazing!!
I love your style, Ingrid! Especially the sleek work space and the wallpaper. I love the idea of the easy wallpaper!
This space is brilliant! Love how functional and beautiful this is. You have decorated it so well! Thanks for sharing the links to all the items ☺️ I’m now considering the folding bed alternative to a daybed for the office room. Curious, what are the dimensions of the room? It’s great how you have space between the desk area and bed.
Loved this video. I always find you're videos really relaxing.
I love your love for Hedwig. It's my all time favorite show and I've seen it way too many times. Are you going to any of the Origin of Love concerts in NYC in June?
Omg I was just watching an old episode of family guy on tv (s14 ep17) and they were mentioning YouTubers at the end and said your name! I loved it ❤️
Thanks for sharing this space with us, it looks so pretty! Love that you’ve made it for you with things you enjoy 😊 Also, how adorable is Tayto slowly crawling under the bed 😂😍
You always inspire me, thank you!
I love your vídeos! I can see the struggle that you have gone through and you have come out of them a much better person.. It's amazing.
Thanks so much for sharing! <3 The L Word :) Where did you get your rug?
Wow I got so much inspiration from this video!! My partner and I work from home a lot (this is a recent developement) and we definitely need an office update that works for two people. 

Much love from Texas!!
Love this office tour and seeing the pics of nugget! I miss him so!
This bed is such a great idea! I'd love to have my own office one day, it looks like it can boost productivity and creativity :)
As soon as you said Alexa my Alexa went crazy 🤣
You did such a great job with this space!
You were one of the very first youtubers I subscribed to waaayyyyy waaayyy back when. I occasionally stop by and it's like hearing from an old friend. 
I hope your life is filled with happiness ♡
Office space/guest bedroom goals 💛
I love your office, and I love how much it feels like you. You clearly put a lot of thought into it from so many angles, and it works!
What a nice space, well done Ingrid! :)
First time watching your channel, and I can't wait to see what you have in store, but right now I'm watching your office tour, which is awesome, love it by the way! 😁👍


Your dog is adorable! 😊
I've always loved your decor style. I  especially liked the old cameras on display.
That Tayters is so flipping cute! Also, love the whole space and how that bed really feels like an actual bed.
Your vid helps me feel calm again after a long week.
Tayto is so cute!! Lol 
And I Love the office Ingrid!! Well done!! ❤️😎👍🏼😊
the 'mint' chairs look grey lol
I don’t understand why you don’t just leave the bed up all the time? It looks great and there seems to be plenty of room to move around.
That bed set up is genius!! Taking notes
😍❤️
Really nice office space/guest room, Ingrid :) You did amazing job with it :) I can see how it inspires people to redecorate their own space :) I, personally, fell in love with the temporary bed <3 It looks better than my actual bed :D
I died with the Shane veladora omg I need.. I love
Love the space! Cozy and personal. I’m Collecting items from memorable times until I can decorate. 👍
Your office is beautiful. I’m trying to create my own office/spare room and this gives me hope it can be done.
Hi Ingrid
I really like your shirt! :)
Love the space! Also, am I the only person who's Alexa started speaking when Ingrid said "Hey Alexa?" It freaked me out!
I'm so glad you did a tour of this room! I've been waiting to see it all put together after following your Insta stories. It's beautiful! I actually love it with the bed there. It looks so cozy and inviting.
Hi
Nice video. :D
I really love how functional this tiny room is!
Shane 😍 ugh I love Carmen
Great office space. Love your haircut and dog 😁😁😁
How you integrated the bed is so neat! It looks very inviting for guests, although not being permanent. 👌By the way... Tayto is so cute.... My dog also has a big love for cozy carpets. 😅❤️🐕
Hi Ingrid I hope to see video of how you spent your night after work. Thank you Candy from Singapore.😘
tato's yawn stretch made me scream in glee
I thought Maia Mitchell made a YouTube channel for a second lmao
I’ve been watching your videos since I was 13 and gradually noticed a change in your aesthetic over the years. I always feel like I never quite know where I sit in the ‘style world’ and am constantly trying to marginalise myself within one and stick with it. You always remind me that as people grow and evolve, so does their personal aesthetic and that’s okay and normal!
seriously the highlight for me was all the Pusheen :)
Yes to more apartment tours! :D <3
The office is pinterest perfect!
super cosy office right there! #goals
Every time I watch Ingrid’s videos, I already know I will have a good day! Like she just puts me in in The best positive mood❤️❤️❤️Ingrid hope you see this!! Love you!!
Wow what a great space!!
Shane ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ also wearing the same necklace right now! Estée's collection is just perfect! ❤️
Wow... I was blown away when you whipped out that bed set up! Awesome!!!
That wallpaper though!! 😍😍😍❤
Loving your home! And your T-shirt is supercute:) :*
Like the ditalis and see the creative Environment
Well , my appartement is smaller than your office ! XD !
Room tour?
love the use of small spaces
This is amazing
Love the Estee Lalonde necklace!
why the dog is always wearing a harness ?
I'm the first one
I really need to smell that candle now lol
The wallpaper issssss sooooo cute!
@Ingrid Nilsen So, on the topic of the L Word, who do you think killed Jenny Schecter?
Love the lip color on you it really looks good.
Alexa STOP!!!! xD
A very nice office tour  loved it.
In the beginning of the video when you where talking about your space never being vinished, it reminded me of English rock singer-songwriter Florence Welch saying her apartment was like an living organism that she tends to (Video: My Place, Florence Welch on Nowness). Her apartment even has a cute british garden by it that Florence likes to meditate in.
but..where is that rug from?
♡♡😍♡♡
where's nugget?
oops a little lipstick stain on your teeth in the intro there.....
God I hate long intros lol
love your office
I LOVE TAYTO
Did you install yourself?
Such a lovely bright room! Would love to know which books you have stacked on the shelves (if thats ok? I am just nosey and as a book lover I am always looking for new reads) xxx
HERE FOR TATER TOT
Nice video, cute office!
Your office is beautiful! I am so impressed by people who manage to NOT be constantly surrounded by ginormous pile of papers they have not yet dealt with.
Hillary <33333
Ilysm , Ingrid!🤗💕
Loved ur New Office! 💻
Office dream
I love West elm
I make paper cranes when I’m upset too!
Can someone click on that thumb ? I don't know what does happen when it gets clicked
I love how you displayed your camera & lens in your office. It’s such unique & cool way to show how far you’ve come in your career.
Where is nugget?
Where is nugget?
Hey Ingrid
Is there something off with her teeth??
I can't blame tayto for liking that rug, it looks so comfy!!! Have you considered getting a day bed instead? Having somewhere cosy to sit could be a nice addition, it could also double as somewhere to sit when you film and it would save you having to assemble the bed all the time (Not that it looked too difficult)
So positive and bright 💕
It's ugly like yoooooooooouuuuuuuuuu
Yesss girl NYC has done you good! I love the office space! Is it sketchy to ask what borough/village you’re in or recommend? I’m looking to move there when I leave college and I just love your place and the vibe you’re giving lately
❤️❤️❤️Shane❤️❤️❤️
Your dad’s painting is beautiful ❤️
OMG that flashback almost made me cry LOL. Congratulations! This is amazing! <3
just realised how long ive been subscribed for!! congratulations ingrid!! ❤️
Congratulations Ingrid! I’ve watched your videos for years and it’s been so inspiring to see your journey to become  the mature, confident #girlboss today! This product also looks fantastic 😍
So excited for you!! ☺️🙌 yay!!!
Ingrid! It’s already sold out! I’m sad I couldn’t snag one, but that’s so exciting!! Congratulations!!
Congrats on this incredible partnership, Ingrid! 👏🎉 The clips you shared were a wonderful walk down memory lane... I've been a viewer of yours for 6 of your 9 years on YouTube and am thrilled to see you partner with such an elegant, great quality brand!
i love the fragrances, but they do NOT last on me or most ppl i know.
I remember picking up my first Jo Malone peony and blush suede because I have watch your videos and you've been raving about Jo malone. Congrats Ingrid ❤
Ahh that flashback!! I have been watching your videos since 2010! Crazy! Congrats on the collab! Super excited to try it!
Wow! Happy for you! I would love to buy if Jo Malone was cruelty free. Unfortunately they are not. Maybe you could talk to them. ;) xo
I’ve been watching you for YEARS! That flashback is so endearing. Well deserved and congrats, girl! 🍾🥂🥳
Congrats!! Tried to purchase on the link you sent but doesn't work as redirects to my country, shame as would love to support you as ive been looking for solid perfumes,  i only have 1 from lush atm, i will get one from jo malone but they would never know its it's because of you 💚😘
Congratulations! I've just discovered Orange Blossom goes very well with Honeysuckle and Davana...
So exciting Ingrid!! But hello, 9 YEARS OF AMAZING HAIR 😂❤️❤️❤️
So exciting!! Congratulations!❤️
Congratulations Ingrid! It so good to see that you are doing a collaboration that you truly advocated of, so much better than those other youtubers who does collaboration just for business. That’s why I love you so much. I was wondering Speaking of being 30s, a lot of us who followed you from the beginning have also grown to this very controversial age group. Can you do a video something like: lessons you learned in your 30s?? Love you, support you always!
Congrats to you, Ingrid, on such a wonderful accomplishment and collaboration!! You are the true epitome of classy!! Your growth is so beautiful and inspiring!! Much love and many blessings to you!! xo <3
Love both of these scents and absolutely love the new way of presenting and packaging them! It's already sold out so going to have to wait but that's so amazing for you Ingrid, congratulations!
I’m so excited for this product but is already sold out. Will be re-stocked?
My two favorite jo malone scents and it's sold out already 😭
Eeeeeeeeeeppppppp!!!!
OMG 9 years?! That means I started watching your videos 8-9 years ago!!! 😮

Congratulations 🥳✨✨✨
What is the necklace you're wearing please!!
Holy Crap! Jo Malone Collab! I can remember everytime you spoke about the brand. So happy for you!
I just ordered it! I’ve never tried Jo Malone London or solid perfume so I’m super excited to try them both together! Love your passion and hope I love the fragrances 🤗
Loved this!!! The flashbacks, the mini travel/process vlog, and jo Malone!! Great job Ingrid!
You haven't aged a bit since I first started watching you!
Congrats! So exciting! 😍✨👏

Congratulations! 😘🤗 I totally understand your love for Jo Malone and your choice! We use the same combination for very similar reasons sooooo coool ! Congratulations Ingrid from the bottom of my heart ❤️ great taste 😘
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!
Omg Ingrid this is so exciting! I learned about Jo Malone from watching your videos when you first started!! 💕💕💕
The moment she revealed that U CAN USE THE SCENTS SEPARATELY OMG i died 😭😭😭 AND I CANNOT BUY IT WHYYYY😭😭😭❤️
I wanna purchase one but I'm not sure if it can be shipped internationally
OMG Ingrid this is SO exciting!! My birthday is tomorrow.  I just might have to splurge and get this for myself, I've always wanted a Jo Malone fragrance because you really have always spoken SO highly of them!!
That is amazing. Definally checking it out. Great alternative to rollerball perfume but more versatile.
Omg this sounds so good!! I wanna try this palette, they are the best!! ☺️
Congratulations!! big fan :) also want to know where is your sweater from? I love the beautiful neckline <3
Yessss my signature scent is wood sage and sea salt 🥰 so excited and happy for youuu
AMAZING! So happy for you Ingrid!! :)
Flashback omg... I started youtube videos with you, neeed three times to see my memories with your flashback ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is so awesome! Congrats! I love that little reel you showed over all those years. :D
So so excited and happy for you. And do think I’ve been watching you for as long as you’ve been talking about them on your channel 😁😱
THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!! CONGRATULATIONS INGRID! WE LOVE YOU!
Your happiness and excitement radiate through the screen! I have goosebumps! Congrats, Ingrid :)
THAT IS NUTS!  I first purchased Jo Malone after seeing you recommend it, and those two scents are my favorite ones that I have on my dresser now!
I am SO excited for you, Ingrid.  This must be THE dream collaboration for you!
omg!!! so excited for you!! and you were such a baby in 2009  <3 hehehe you "did not look like you" XD
Just got mine today :) First experience with Jo Malone and I love the scents
Hi Ingrid, can you share where your necklace is from?
I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU! ❤ That is such a cool experience, Ingrid, and you shouldn't feel bad about being so hyped about it. Also, that's a really cool perfume pallet. I love how user friendly that design is.
I am so so happy for you.  Wood Sage and Sea Salt is my signature scent.  I travel a lot so this combo will be perfect 💜
I have worn this Jo Malone combination for years! I love how Wood Sage and Sea Salt is the perfect partner to so many of the Jo Malone fragrances. And how perfect that your partner wears it! Congrats!
So sad it doesn’t ship to Hong Kong😢
I want it so badly
This is awesome! Love both scents.. your videos are one of the reasons i bought my first Jo Malone fragrance ever since wood sage and sea salt has been my signature scent! I pair it with orange blossom or BlackBerry and bay
Congratulations Ingrid!! ❤️
Congrats, I know how much you love them!
Timer Warner building is 15 blocks from my UWS apt, yay! Congrats! So excited for you! xx
I love all the flashbacks!!
Got mine!!! Peony and blush has become my signature scent as well and I can’t wait to have it in a solid form. Congratulations on this collab!
so proud of you Ingrid sad that I cant buy it in Germany
This is amazing, congrats Ingrid!!:) I definitely know how much you love Jo Malone fragrances, I think you are the reason Why  Peony & Blush Suede is the only JML scent I can name instantly:D
Joe Malone London you couldn’t have picked a better person to collaborate with! She’s super humble and overall amazing! you can have all my money!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
This is so perfect! My personal fragrance is Nectarine Blossom and Honey. But since I have the huge bottle, I cannot bring it with me when I travel. This is so convenient! Thanks for creating this.
OMG!!! I so so so sooo love Jo Malone scents!!! And it really is disappointing to know that it has only few exposures of it here in Youtube so thank you for doing this and please keep it coming 😁
Congratulations!!!! I love this product idea too 😍
I originally just decided to go for the energetic pallet that has the zesty lime basil & mandarin and the blackberry & bay scents because it is a little more my style. But then I read on their website that your palette goes with those scents too so I ordered both! I’m  So excited to get these palettes in the mail! I didn’t know I needed it until I saw this video, and realized how much more convenient a solid fragrance is. It was exactly what I had been looking for! Now I will have a bunch of scent combinations to chose from!
Aww, Go Ingrid! Cheers to you!
Wow Ingrid, this is so cool!! Well done!! 👏🏼 I almost teared up, when I saw the videos from years ago...I remember you from that age... It's incredible how far you've come girl 🙌🏼😍😌 WELL FRICKIN DONE 😁💕
Wow can’t believe I’ve been watching you for 9 years! You turned me on to jo Malone. I’m so happy for you!! ❤️❤️
Congratulations Ingrid! 💗🎉🎈
I didn’t expect myself to be tearing up towards the end of this video....but I am glad that I found you years ago and being able to grow up with you over the years, thank you for always being so genuine, and Congratulations Ingrid!
Congratulations Ingrid! So happy for you 🌸
Big congrats Ingrid! May u know it will ship oversea as i cannot find info (yet)? Love u from ur mother’s land
This is great news Ingrid you deserve every bit of it. Congrats! And I absolutely love the products reviewed by you. Several of such branded products I also found on coupon website like Kiindly with some great discounts on them. Much power to you!
Ingrid! Long time subscriber here! ILYSM! So proud of you! Do you know if this will be available internationally i live in Mexico and I soooo want it!
Im so excited that u love jo malone too🤗🤗🤗
Congratulations! Very happy for you!
Omg, this time lapse made me just realize, I have been following your channel for six years! Time flies, I still continue to enjoy the content you post, thank you!
I’ve never tried their products before and always wanted to!! What’s the best scent for men? If someone knows lol thanks! :) and Ingrid so proud of you!!! ❤️❤️🎉🎉
Congratulations, Ingrid! 😊 Question, can you choose your own combo? I personally like to combine blackberry and bay and nectarine blossom and honey
Congrats! Not joking that’s the  only two bottles I have from Jo Malone 💕
What an incredible journey that I've followed along with you for the past 8 or 9 years (silently).  You are the reason why I tried Jo Malone for the first time with Peony & Blush Suede being my signature scent and has continued being the only cologne I have worn for the past 5+ years.

I am so happy and proud of you, Ingrid.  Wish you the best xx.
This collab is like the most exclusive collab I’ve seen on YouTube! I don’t think I’ve seen any other youtubers collab with them!! How amazing! Congrats xx
So cool :-). I love Jo Malone and I'm so bumped, that they are testing on innocent animals, so I don't buy their products anymore. It's a shame :-(. But no fragurance is worth torturing animals.
sooo excited for you! also love the scents together - been meaning to purchase Jo Malone for a few years now (knowing you've loved it forever)..so happy I can't wait to get my hands on Ingrid Nilsen's Perfect Pair!
Congrats Ingrid!! 😍❤️
Omg wood sage n sea salt is my signature winter fragrance 💗💗
This is amazing!! Congratulations on the partnership.
Wow congrats 👯‍♂️👯‍♀️❤
Omg..did you say India!!! Miss my country..hope you have fun
Wow this is amazing! I love Jo Malone fragrances!
Omg this is totally awesome!! I need to have this in my purse, always!! I love Jo Malone. 💛💛💛
congrats！love it！
It's sold out!
OMG these are literally my two favorite scents!
Congrats 🎊🍾🎉🎈 this is amazing 👍🏻👍🏻
Also what a coincidence I’ve just research review of Earl Grey& Cucumber then i came across your video 😍 and yes i have a bottle of Wood sage &Sea Salt myself❤️
So proud of you!!! This is such a cool thing!!! 💗💗💗
Tried out these candles because of you! So excited about this collaboration!
congrats, Ingrid! it's so nice to see your hard work over the years pay off and it's really cool to see you so genuinely happy!
haha the feels when you watched for 10 years
So proud and happy for you! What lip color are you wearing? Can't find it in the description.
Congratulations Ingrid!!! What a perfect collaboration! 💕
Hope that Jo Malone would sell this in the Philippines! 🙏🏻❤️
So cool! Is Jo Malone a cruelty free company?
Totally would've bought it if it hadn't sold out. Kinda bummed. 😕
I already have these two!  I am going to try the combo. Ty ♡
So so happy for you! I’ve always thought of you everytime I’ve ever seen Peony and Blush suede mentioned anywhere by anyone, I’m SO excited to get your scent palette and explore it for myself! I’ve watched you since the beginning and your videos have carried me through some dark and difficult times in my life, I think just knowing it’s your scent will give it an added layer of comfort and happiness for me. Love you Ingrid! ♥️
Congratulations Ingrid, this is so well deserved! You definitely were the first person to introduce me to Jo Malone years & years ago
I love your honesty in your videos!! you are such an inspiration. you've actually inspired me to start being more confident with my videos on YouTube ! #notificationsquad lil small YouTuber here
Congratulations!  Will this product be available in London?
YASSS!!!! This makes me so excited! I’ve been listening to you talk about them for so long I ended up getting a sample from Sephora of Wood Sage and Sea Salt months ago and fell in love with it and now it’s part of your collaboration! So excited to order this! <3
It only ships to the US 😭
What is up with your teeth the past while. They look so stained
Omg this is awesome! Congrats Ingrid!  <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 I really want to purchase it but it's only available in the states
Yaaaay!!! I love Jo Malone. Congrats
So exciting!  You introduced me to the scent years ago and I waited a long time to invest in a bottle. I finally bought one when I got engaged and wore it for all the important events in that season (dress shopping, bridal showers, engagement pictures). I then of course wore it for our wedding and now almost every day since. I’ve tied so many happy memories and and moments to it, so thank you! I can’t wait to try this pallet when it hopefully come back in stock! Congratulations!!
So proud of you Ingrid! Love you!
Nahh sis this ain't it. Your channel is kind of dead. It's in the past lol
OMG! 2010 Ingrid!! That's when I started watching your videos & getting into makeup! ♥
So proud of you! Cannot wait to try the palette out :)
It's already sold out :(
It’s a pity it’s not owned by Jo anymore, Estée Lauder really screwed her. Congrats all the same 😊
It's inspiring to see you so excited about this! It's clear that this was a huge passion project for you, and I can only imagine your sense of accomplishment and fulfillment about seeing it come to life. Also, working on a fragrance project just sounds so awesome and creative and fun! Happy for you :)
9 years and you legit haven't aged one bit 😳
Congratulations, Ingrid ♡
Congratulations, Ingrid ♡
I bought my favorite scent Nectarine Blossom & Honey from Jo Malone recently, and I got 2 samples: Peony Blush Suede and Wood sage & Sea Salt! I didn't get to buy your product but it's just like I did! I am so excited for this, congratulations!!
Congrats!! This is huge and wonderful!!
Love this! I'm a huge fan of wood sage and sea salt. I combine it with wild bluebell. So I'm excited to try your palette--ive never smelled peony and blushes suede. Is the solid perfume line limited edition?
Congratulations!  So cute to see the old clips of you.
Holy sh*t , the main reason ive continued to watch you for like 8 years is because my go to scent is also peonie and blush swede and recently wood sage and sea salt ! What the hell im sooooo excited ive never thought to layer them. Wow insane ingrid it just amazing !
I got a sample of Jo Malone and am dying to sample ALL the other scents. Congratulations on your collaboration.
Omg miss glam baby in the blue room so young
this is so special! congrats!
I bought mine! Can’t wait for its arrival!
wood sage and sea salt with blackberry and bay is my favourite combination of scents!
Holy moly, you were the first person to mention Jo Malone to me and you really turned me onto Peony and Blush. I have still yet to buy a full size though
ARE YOU KIDDING!!!???  WOW! Congrats!!!!  So excited!!  I adore BOTH Wood Sage and Sea Salt and Peony and Blush Suede separate as well as together, and cant wait to try these solids!!!  Couldnt be happier for you!
Fantastic! Congratulations, Ingrid
I'm in shock. She's already 30? I thought she's the same age as me. Whoah. 😮
Love Jo Malone perfumes. I have two sitting on my dresser right now. Congrats!🎉
Hi ingrid. Im.in australia and tried to click on the link but cant find the product. Id love to purchase one.
The beginning where you go through all the years, somehow made me emotional. Especially for people that have been there for 9 years they know how it feels! Congratulations Ingrid, you deserve it!
Wow congrats. I actually had never heard of Jo Malone until you talked about it on your channel when I first started watching. I went to Nordstrom the next day to smell the scents that you talked about. I also remember you talk about the candles as well i believe. this is so great!
Congratulations!!🌺
I need this to arrive in Australia already !
Loved the montage! 😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
i just placed an order .... can't wait
Really happy to hear that.  I started keeping a look out since I saw mentions of it on ur channel
Jo Malone is inconsistent with the longevity of their fragrances. It smells good but I'm disappointed at some of my purchases. They just don't last.
This collab feels so right !!!!! 😘
the two fragrances you chose (won't spoil!) are actually the first two Jo Malone perfumes I bought! They are my absolute fav :)
I’m so happy for you Ingrid!!!
Congratulations what a milestone 💞
What is the necklace you're wearing? It's beautiful!!
I’m so happy for you!!!’ Omg!!!!!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤
that was a nostalgia bomb just dropped on me
so happy for you!
I would have never heard of Joe Malone if it wasn’t for you!!
Congrats, Ingrid!
I just tried to buy this and I realized that it’s not available anymore 😭
So excited for you!  I was with friends yesterday and somehow we talked about Youtube. It just so happened that we were just walking by a Jo Malone store, and I told them, "oh and this is Ingrid's favorite."  Told them also that when I went to London a few years back, I got a Peony and Blush Suede just because it's your favorite.
SO PROUD OF YOU INGRID :D!
Omg its sold out!
That’s my scent combination! I have both bottles and spritz on before I walk out the door!! This is so cool!
I’m so excited for you!!!
Omg they restock it everyone....
Love jo Malone and love Ingrid! Yayyyy!
Congratulations!! I'm so happy that you got the opportunity to collaborate with a brand that you truly love. These two scents are my favorites from Jo Malone too! I've never tried them together....I think mainly because of Jo Malone's fragrance recommendations online. It's too bad I missed this due to work. Boo Hoo.
Is there a way to just buy one perfume instead of both?
Congrats 🙌🙌
Congrats Ingrid👌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🌸🌸🌸🌸
Congratulations 💖💖🎉💖💖
Congrats Ingrid!
Congrats Ingrid!!!
so proud!
Congratulations- such a lovely product! Will it be available to anyone outside the US?
Congrats ingrid!!
Is that gonna be available outside the us too?
Anyone else watch the white dot? 😂
Congratulations Ingrid!!! 
I enjoyed this video and I can’t wait to choose my fragrance from Jo Malone. I’ve been wanting to try the line for 3 years now and today is the day I’m heading to Neiman Marcus to check out which one is my absolute favorite and will become one of my scents.
Estée’s necklace :)
So happy for you Ingrid! I couldn’t think of anyone else to have such partnership with Jo Malone. Just placed my order from Brazil and I wouldn’t think twice to support you! You deserve such recognition and you must celebrate this for many years!
Is this only available in the U.S. ???
Is this cruelty free ?!
I read some comments that say it’s not !!!
Please discuss with them !!!
This is not ok if that is the case !!!
Congratulations Ingrid xoxo
Sold out?  :(
so it is sold out ... does that mean it is gone forever?
Congretss too  this colebration
3:06 whoa! she looks like Megan Markle!
Anyone knows what necklace is from at the beginning of the video? So cute! Thanks.
can't wait !!!
I’m crying because it’s sold out and i can’t get one for myself 😭😭😭😭😭 Ingrid, i’m so happy for you but don’t let me be sad!
SOLD OUT 😢
It's sold out!;(
that one lady is not looking so happy.......
Congratulations ❤️ Can’t wait to try it out
This is a dream!!!!!
I would defo buy if they were cruelty free 😞
So thrilled for you, Ingrid!! Congratulations on this well deserved partnership. I'll never forget when I met you many years ago & you smelled like Peony and Blush Suede. I've always been a fragrance person, but I can't seem to stick with one signature scent bc I love too many haha. However, Wood Sage and Sea Salt is one of my go-to's, especially since moving to Florida. I just purchased your palette - cannot wait for it to arrive!!
I went to look at it online and it's sold out already
Congrts Ingrid how cool! I loooove JoMalone to me is such a fancy and elegant brand!
Iconic colaboration
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How awesome!!
omg congrats
Congrats!!!
Jo Malone does animal testing.
Congratulations!
What necklace are you wearing? It’s really pretty.
Congratulations Ingrid
Amazing!
Ingrid has changed in appearance so much in the last year or two, I hope the women she's in a relationship with isn't trying to change her, but sadly it looks that way :/
Congrats!
Ilysm , Ingrid!🤗💕
happy for you
I want it!
Is this pallet still available?
crying at that nine year flashback! Congratulations, Ingrid!
Congratulationssss Ingriiid
Omg congrats! Everything you recommend I love! 
Are there any other stores that sell joe Malone London?
bought peony and blush this summer finally and LOVE it! my fiance loves when i wear it. thanks for introducing us to it!
Jo Mallon
Omg I'm so proud of you ❤️ I've been in your family for years and it's nice to see you come this far 😊
3:05 those Asians just sit there and use their mobile phone when it's time to talk to each other lol
Honestly, I shave when I want to and if I don’t want to; then I don’t.
Can we let people live lol 
Do what you want and don’t judge the person next to you 
I shave sometimes as a man cuz I feel like it lol 
I think woman should be able to do the same
I stopped regularly shaving about 2.5 years ago. For me, I always hated shaving because it was time consuming and caused irritation especially in my underarms. I stopped because one day a guy I had been casually seeing made a comment about the fact that he was a man, and therefore didn’t have to shave his legs. At the time I had several “hippie” friends that I admired a lot that didn’t shave, and I took offense to what he said. At that point I stopped shaving out of protest. I have been shocked by how much support I’ve received. Most people don’t care. My boyfriend doesn’t care, my female friends say “I wish I could do that,” and my male friends applaud me for it. Most people admire that I’ve made the choice, and I usually don’t bring it up anymore because it’s not something I think about much. At the beginning, I was afraid of how people would react, that people might give me disgusted looks, but no one did. I still wear things to cover up sometimes when I’m feeling insecure, but I think that’s okay. There are other days in the summer where I will wear shorts and a tank top, proudly. Usually people don’t even notice because my hair is not very dark. Sometimes I trim the underarms and the pubic hair so that it doesn’t peak out, as mine will grow and grow. But never too short because it gets uncomfortable for me. I think the most important thing to remember is that it IS a cosmetic practice, and should be treated with the same level of freedom. Not everyone wears makeup, and that’s fine. Not everyone shaves, and that should be fine too. If you want to do it occasionally, for aesthetic reasons, do it! It’s YOUR choice. If you change your mind and decide you’re more comfortable shaving, that’s FINE! It should be optional. Same goes for eyebrows. Sometimes I pluck, sometimes I don’t. Most people couldn’t care less.
"But just letting you know I'm a real human being..." This is one of the many reasons why I appreciate you, what you represent and stand for, and your content.  You are a real human being and your honesty and transparency is such a respectable quality. Thank you for making videos like this. <3
I would love to see an update video about your experiences during the summer! I only feel pressure to shave when I know my legs or underarms will be exposed, and it's so silly, but I don't know if I could step out of the house in shorts without shaving. I wish we lived in a society where women's body hair wasn't taboo :/
I shave when I feel like it. Which is usually only in the summer when it’s hot outside.
I just turned 13 so I just started getting body hair recently. I was (and still am) uncomfortable and immediately I wanted to get rid of it. Watching this video made me feel a little better about it and right now since I’m overall uncomfortable about pretty much uncertainty with my entire body, a little bit of comfort goes a long way. 
Thank you so much, 
Savannah ❤️❤️❤️
I honestly don’t care when people don’t remove body hair. Like, you do you boo! Haha! For me, I enjoy this part of my self-care routine. Just like how I just enjoy putting on a facemask, a bubble bath, and whatnot. My husband shaved his underarms because he is super sweaty there, just like me! Haha! When he does not shave there, the sweat gets trapped and it causes a big rash. I deal with the same thing. But oh well. We’ll live (probably)! 😂
I really don't understand why this is such a controversial topic. Just like many other things, this should be a person's own choice. If you want to wear makeup, then do, and if you don't, then don't. It should be the same with this. Maybe it's because I have blonde body hair, but I seriously don't see why it should be removed, especially arm hair, but I definitely respect people who feel like they do want to get rid of it.
I love this! I have dark body hair and I’ve been extremely embarrassed of my inner thigh area. I hate summer so much and I never wear shorts. I don’t even wear swimsuits anymore because my hair is just so dark that even if I shaved the night before you can see it the next day. I hate that we as women have to shave just so we can feel ourselves, in reality ourselves are hairy humans for a reason. You go Ingrid! I hate shaving with a passion. I love winter so I can hide away.
I do shave but I love seeing women who don’t shave. I find it inspirational and one day I’ll build the confidence to join you! Go Ingrid!!!
Fully support women making choices about what to do with their own bodies. Don’t see why it should concern others so much to the point of anger
Just a little TMI, I’ve always loved when a woman embraced their pubic hair. I remember when I was younger & in my first girl relationship I was put down for my hair & even made fun of by my partner at the time and other family members!! I was always so ashamed. But now, not only do I embrace body hair, at the same time I’m supportive of ether direction. ☺️
What's missing from the conversation is facial hair. Still stigmatized and no one wants to talk about it.
Those girls who say they do it for themselves, would they do it if there was nobody else in the world except them?
I stopped shaving on a regular basis because It is such a lengthy process  (especially as an indian woman with super thick hair) I found that overtime I just stopped caring. When I got into a relationship a year ago I was scared I'd be judged by my man so I started shaving everyday again but honestly when I asked him he said he didn't even care so now I'm at a point again where I shave whenever the hell I want. I wish this was something that people didn't get judged for.
I found this video very interesting especially the history part. I had some of the same feelings when I stopped wearing bras everyday about 2 years ago, but now it feels really normal and Nobody is actually looking that closely at your bod anyway!
For me it's interesting that female body hair would be associated with a bad odour. In my experience this is not something I ever hear men expressing concern about - whether it be their own hair or other men's. Odour around men's body hair is also not something I, or any of the women I know, be concerned about. I think this shows how the influence of historical and societal norms and fashions is ever prevalent in people's minds. I loved this video Ingrid and thought everything you said was super interesting - thank you for making it xx
Can you share how you navigate around showing your armpit hair in formal/professional settings? Personally, i think that would the biggest mental barrier to bypass - as in, I'm afraid that others would perceive me to be unprofessional/unkempt because of the way I choose to not shave, along with the indirect impact of such perceptions on other aspects of my career (i.e. taken seriously; promotions etc). Any thoughts you have to share about this?
As a man, I always liked underarm hair on women.
I absolutely love this video, I stopped shaving my leg hair a few years back because I was sick of the razor burn and then the itchy-ness that happens the day after when the stubble starts. I started shaving again just recently and still absolutely hate doing it for the exact same reasons but I felt so judged by anyone who saw my legs (including even my dr.) that I felt the pressure to start again! This video is much needed and like I said I love it 🥰 😍
shaving is not a hygiene thing. if it was everybody would be expected to do it, not only woman. i personally don't shave because i hate the feeling and summer is hard because everything you do that challenges traditional femininity and women not conforming to gender expectations is met with so much judgment, but i still think it's more comfortable to me than shaving, even though my body hair is super dark and noticeable. 


about pubic hair in particular i always liked it. i started having body hair at a young age and shaving it makes me feel like a child. it feels wrong, my body hasn't looked like this since i was a tween and i'm a grown ass woman, so trying to replicate this creeps me out. the idea that we have to be hairless is probably the most disturbing beauty standard out there
Thank you for making such an important video, Ingrid! For me, I hate the process of shaving my legs. It is a costly, timely, and uncomfortable experience! However, the social norms that exist in our society is what makes it so hard for the act of not shaving as a woman to be so difficult. We need to have these conversations in an effort to normalize a woman's choice not to shave. Thank you for being a constant advocate for these critical issues <3 I aspire to do this in my career too, someday!
I commend you on growing out your body hair, but I could never! 
(in my country accent)
I have hyperhydrosis and body hair and sweating isn't a good look or smell 🤭
I think it's a personal choice. If you are happy then more power to you. Personally I hate to see body hair, more underarms and legs than anything else. I could never not shave but as I say it's a personal choice and I never judge others for their choices xxx
I'm 22 and haven't shaved my legs since I was 16 and shave my underarms only when I want to. For those of you speaking about 'by that logic you shouldn't touch your eyebrows' IT IS ABOUT CHOICE its about women having the choice to decide how it makes them feel, look and exist without anyone's honest opinion but their own. As Ingrid has pointed out, there is a long oppressive history of body hair on women. Thank you Ingrid for being a public figure that is open about this and thanks for sharing your growth (literally) so publicly without shame xxx
Listen. I’m musty, my body hair holds odor & I LIVE for smelling fresh. If you’re not a sweaty/tart person, then great. But for me, this wouldn’t be an option under the best case scenario 😂
It’s awesome  that you’re  living your life unapologetically. You’re a true leader. 💓
That's great!  I shave my underarms and legs kinda regularly, but it usually turns out to be once a month if that.  I have grown it out all the way before to see if I wanted body hair.  It didn't bother me, but I realized I like smooth pits and legs sometimes too.  I used to be pressured to shave my pubic hair by an ex.  When I started dating my now husband I said, I'm not shaving that any more, take it or leave it.  He said it was my body to do so as I pleased.  No more itchy or infected razor burn bumps for me!
The history part was so interesting ! Thanks for sharing your journey and discussing about it. I do prefer shaving when it comes to my own body, but I totally respect my friends and other women that don't. Whether you shave or not, it's all good. 
 Have a nice day everyone !
This is really informative and beautifully composed. Well done, Ingrid!
I think a lot of "normal" women like me, remove hair whenever we feel like it and leave it for a prolonged amount of time. I don't feel compulsion to do it but I dunno 🤷🏽‍♀️
I don’t regularly remove my body hair anymore. But I was pressured to by a lot of my friends in middle school and high school. It was actually a really positive experience with a man that made me think twice about the whole thing. I was in a local community play, and a few of the older girls were having a conversation about how gross it was that other girls didn’t shave when wearing shorts or sleeveless shirts (we were changing in and out of costumes in front of each other, so those sorts of conversations just sort of popped up now and then). A guy in his mid-twenties passed by and overheard what we were talking about and said that he actually thought it was cool for girls not to remove their body hair, because it showed that they were more confident and comfortable with themselves. I was really shocked (you know, because of patriarchal indoctrination) but really happy. I’d always been made to feel ashamed about body hair, but here a GUY (gasp) was saying that he actually liked it. 

That was a really positive moment that’s always stuck with me when it comes to this topic. He probably didn’t even know how much his words would help me NOW as a grown woman, let alone a young girl who was struggling with her self-esteem. Thanks again, random guy ❤️
Omg so happy you're talking about this! Never clicked a video so fast. I've been on my own journey with my body hair as well. I've been struggling with my arm pit hair and how I feel about it, but I know right now I want to have it and explore how it feels having it. I thought many of the things mentioned in this video, and I'm still struggling with some of them. Feeling like body hair would make me dirty, masculine, unhygenic, that I was shaving for me but then I began to question that, realizing society taught me that shaving it feels good. I became curious how it could feel being comfortable in my natural state. So far, so good, but still a little uncomfortable lol. I've also been very curious about maintenance options! Please keep us posted with your trimming experiments!!
I absolutely love this video.  Thank you for making it.  I feel the same way about my body hair.  I only trim. Thank you so much for helping break the stereotype.
I find this interesting. I love what you’re doing and encouraging other women to maybe try this as well. I hope one day it will be more normalized. Great video.
using small scissors to trip pubic hair works very well 😊
Actually !!! I don't shave/ wax my underarm all that often unless I wear something that shows my underarm. HOWEVER, I am an active person, and I NOTICED, that I tend to smell MORE when its longer hair... LOL and I had REALLY long hair. So to that note, its just depends on how one sweat :)
GO INGRID GO. normalize our bodies!!!!! unapologetic feminism!!!! i love it!
I've noticed that I smell less with more body hair. I think it's because when you sweat, the hair pulls the bacteria away from your body.
Lastly, I apologize for multiple posts...... Research how Sophia Loren was treated by Americans whom were disgusted  by her armpit hair in big movies, and how she was treated by those in her hometown in Italy when she shaved to “become American”. It’s crazy. Americans didn’t like her with it, Italian men didn’t like her without it. (This is going by my research decades ago. If any Italians know differently please don’t hate me. 😂 ♥️)
I love how you address topics we don’t tend to talk about much. Thanks!
Most of men have body hair but they don't smell why should we ? I don't understand why this is an issue for some people
I don't want to offend anyone but I find that body hair varies according to race. My family is Brazilian, indigenous (Amazonian) and African and we don't have much body hair. My Asian friends don't have much body hair but my European and Middle Eastern friends have a lot of body hair. I don't know if anyone else has seen differences according to race/ethnicity. I'm sure it varies from group to group.
I've so enjoyed seeing you blossom and flourish over the years <3
great to hear more conversation about this! I haven't shaved my legs in over a decade and shave my armpits maybe once or twice a year, usually for a wedding or when I'm wearing a bathing suit. lately though I haven't shaved at all and went to the hot springs for a day with my dark (and honestly kind of long) asian hair in my armpits showing. I actually even stopped using deodorant after using a lot of natural ones for years and having a bad reaction to one, so I think about my armpit hair even less on a daily basis. (I didn't realize some asian ethnicities have a gene thing where you don't get body odor? I don't think I do, but who knows.) like ingrid I'm kind of nervous about summer ... I've noticed that I sometimes cover it up or just shave it. but I'd like to change that this year!
I'm still a bit torn about my body hair sometimes. I have neurodermitis so shaving irritates my skin so much it can cause rashes and stuff, so that's (supposed to be) competely off the table. I trim my body hair usually but when I go partying or do a dance recital I shave my pits. I then get angry at myself for feeling the need to do so. I'm not "skinny, conventionally attractive" so I feel like if I'm heavier than is deemed okay in our society and also don't shave I will just draw so many negative reactions on to me and I don't think I could handle that at the moment. So,well, maybe one day I'm more self-assured but right now I'm still on a journey. Thanks so much for the video though <3 It helped me to maybe become a bit more "brave" myself :)
Ingrid! This was such an inspiring video to watch. I've been struggling with wanting to stop shaving for years. Every time I shave (armpits, legs, pubic hair), my skin breaks out. I get itchy, eczema, and razor burn up the wazoo! I tried everything--waxing, hypoallergenic shaving cream, extra blades in my razors before I stepped back and thought to myself: "Wait, I should listen to my body and what it's trying to tell me." It hates any form of hair removal, and is letting me know it very loudly. I stopped shaving at first to let the burning dwindle down. Ever since (about a month ago) my skin has cleared up beautifully and I have a little more than stubble on my legs and armpits. It's wonderful and humbling realization to step back and ask yourself "why am I spending so much time, energy and M O N E Y on something that clearly isn't good for my body." Keep rockin ya beautiful natural self!
I'm so glad you included historical context! It's impossible to completely separate personal choice from societal norms (esp when they're so strictly adhered to). It's so interesting to me how many people attempt to defend their choice to shave. You can acknowledge that its expected of you and still choose to do it...
Hey Ingrid, i just wanted to let you know how proud we are of you. I started watching you way back when you were dating Luke and haging out with Joe Graceffa, you evolved so much from that beauty youtuber to revealling your trueself and raising awareness to important matters. You are using your plataform to change and impact many lives
Thank you for making this video ingrid! This is such an important thing to address. Personally I haven't been shaving my armpits for about 6 years now because there's no point in shaving and I find it a very empowering statement. However, I sometimes notice being anxious about it in summer so I totally feel you there. Also: I've met quite a few people who find my body hair very attractive; I guess you just come across as very confident and happy with your body which many people find sexy regardless of whether you're thin/shaved etc. Looking forward to hearing more about your experience! Xx
Love this!

I’ve ALWAYS been very lazy with my body hair. I was a lifeguard when I was a teen, and even wearing shorts regularly at work didn’t make me remove it regularly. Now, I often force people to look at how long my leg hairs are and they are always fascinated because they’d never noticed 😂😂 (when I say ‘they’ I mean girls - guys are always more ‘ew’ but idgaf). I do still use hair removal cream, but only at the start of school holidays (I’m a teacher). It feels like a luxurious treat 😂 public hair wise, you can get bikini trimmers and in fact that’s all I use even in the holidays - on the shortest possible setting. My skin is then much less irritated and I get much less ingrown hair on my bikini line.

I will say though, that I am VERY lucky to be pretty fair haired? My head hair and under arm hair is light brown. Pubes are a little darker, but my leg hair is mostly blonde. When I tan I look kinda sparkly because they reflect the light 😂😂
i don’t ever really watch youtube that much and initially i was just gonna check to see if there’s anything interesting before i moved on over to netflix. i clicked on your video (usually with yt videos i sort of skip everything just enough so i get the general idea) and i was completely hooked! i watched the entire vid which is something i never really do! how do you do it??
Love it! Keep doing what you feel is best for your body.
Just out of curiosity, why do YOU want body hair? Don’t think you addressed it in the video. What do you like about it?
I only remove underarm hair because it's not time consuming and it's the only area where my skin doesn't get irritated. I think it's everyone's own choice whether or not one removes body hair. After all, it's natural :D
Thank you for this video, Ingrid! This definitely is something that needs to be more talked about. For me, I epilate my underarms when I want to. I don't shave my legs or my arms because I like the way it looks plus the arm and leg hair keeps me warm (as I get cold very easily!)
Yay! So proud to see women unashamed of their body hair 💛💛💛
My ex constantly pointed out my body hair, to the point where I was shaving/waxing/etc. all the time for him just so he wouldn't point it out. It's made me so self-conscious, even after we broke up.
Personal choice. I just find it gross not to shave. More power to you!
Ёбнулась совсем
You look just like the mom from the original Santa Clause
That negative list is how I see body hair, this won't change.
Yes Ingrid! The way we change these norms is by talking about them and questioning our own thoughts. You are making a positive difference!
I'm just gonna come right out and say it; sex feels better ( for me and my partner) when their is zero pubic hair. So, it's a sensory thing not a fashion one.
As far as odor, I live in a very humid climate in summer. There are 2 places in the body that we have Apocrine glands, the armpits and the groin. These glands produce odor. Humidity increases the odor where these glands are located regardless of hair being there or not. Native deodorant which is non-aluminum based has worked.great for me. In both areas. Just in the crease of the groin...never near any sensitive pink parts! Hope that helps some folks.
It's so fab and inspiring that you are talking about this!! I've always been intrigued by growing out body hair, and I've definitely become a lot more relaxed about it as I've grown older x
WHOO!! LOL I haven't shaved anything for the past 4 months , it has been snowing and hella cold so there's no reason to shave it haha
Does that include your brows?
Thank you so much for bringing such a complex topic forward! You're the best.
so..will you let your moustache grow too??
I trim my downstairs with a trimmer. Husband always wanted bald... but I don't,  so he can deal with it.
I used to think body hair was gross, but as I got older I realized how big of an issue I was making it when it’s really a non issue. I shave regularly, but if I miss a few days (or a week) here and there it doesn’t bother me. I’ve dated men and women. I’ve dated girls who shave and girls who don’t. Either way, it doesn’t bother me. I love the person, their choice of grooming doesn’t affect that and I don’t care either way.
Ingrid if you haven't read the book  "Girls will be girls" by Emer O Toole I think you would love it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject. It also has a great list of literature.
I'm so about this movement! Really inspires me to do the same! Thanks Ingrid!
In fact I think shaving is for "my self" first. its make me feel clean and fresh :)
but I wondering  why anybody need to think so deep in every thing!!
How does pubic hair and wearing a swimsuit work?!
I applaud you Ingrid! This is part of a larger issue of society pressuring women and girls to conform to pornographic patriarchal beauty standards. And it is very infantilizing and pedofilic that we are supposed to look like little girls when we are grown women!

I'll leave this quote here that speaks to this:
"Not one part of a woman’s body is left untouched or unaltered, no feature or extremity is spared the art or pain of improvement: Hair is dyed, lacquered, straightened, permanented, eyebrows are plucked, pencilled, dyed, eyes are lined, mascara’d, shadowed, lashes are curled or false. From head to toe every feature of a woman’s face, every section of her body is subject to modification and alteration." - Andrea Dworkin
I love that you actually have your own mixed feelings. I appreciate that greatly!!!
I trim by using hair cutting scissors.
Never tried a buzzer, ik some gay men use it.
I think it comes down to preference?
#GirlsSupportingGirls
Power to you, girl! I’ve been growing my eyebrows out for several months now and although it’s a small step, I think it’s a step in the right direction.
Wow! This was such a well done video. I hardly gave shaving a second thought but wow there is so much baggage with it. Thank you for being brave enough to make a video about it and sharing your journey, otherwise people like me wouldn't have figured it out on our own.
So inspiring, I love this and have been trying to be more comfortable and confident in what happens naturally with my body. Thank you 💕💕💕
Shaving it reduces the bad smell, i think it is part of being clean person, not a personal thing.
I live in the Caribbean (Dominican Republic)  that means summer ALL YEAR LONG so, body  hair is not an option for us, sometimes I wish to shave even my head when is hot!
I really love that you're sharing your journey. I stopped shaving a few years ago and I still have these feelings sometimes, especially in summer. Good luck ♥️
I don't shave because I have sensitive skin and bad eczema. I've had moments in the past when the eczema under my armpits was very raw and painful. I don't think having armpit hair is more unhygienic than that to be completely honest.


I really loved the video. It was very thoughtful and honest.
Thank you for speaking out on this topic! Your videos are such high quality. It is evident a lot of thought has been put in! ❤️
Amazing Amazing Amazing. I never comment but had to say well done for using your platform to talk about this!
What a refreshing perspective. You are so honest and thoughtful when approaching topics like these. Thank you for the high quality content!
Hello Ingrid, I just wanted to say that your so beautiful and whatever you do to accept yourself helps so many with confidence, you’ve always been helpful for me and I love all your videos Xx I hope to meet you one day because you are so inspirational and wouldn’t feel as confident without your videos,
Thank you for being such a great person and also always being so true to yourself and for being sweet x❤️❤️lots of love
Needed this. Thank you Ingrid ❤️
Thank you for this. I would love to be able to do this for myself one day and you really inspire me start trying! ❤
When are you starting a podcast? 
I love your energy and voice
Thoughts on pubic hair possibly showing in swimwear?
The difference between beauty standards for man and women are insane. The list for women goes on goes on.. things women need to do in order to feel or to be feminine.

Respect for filming this!! Thanks you for opening up about a controversial topic xx
Lovely video. Personally, I do remove my body hair but your point of view is beautiful, thank you for sharing.❤
Thanks for sharing your experience! I watched your video whilst shaving... I felt like I needed to stop half way through 😉
gurllllll!!! All the power to you!!! 💪💪💪
I’d argue deodorant is also optional and not “natural”.
I loved this! really interesting & super important
I would love to see an update as the hotter months are coming! Thanks Ingrid!
Yeeesss! Thank you for making this <3
Thank you for this video ! ❤
You are always inspiring! Thanks for this video Ingrid💕
For me leg hair is extremely uncomfortable under tight pants. So, I shave it. I shave my armpits every now and then, especially if I notice a more intense scent. I only trim my pubes, as shaving it causes ingrown hair and discomfort. Trimming helps with period management (internal protection). I still shave it once in a while, because I love the feeling of smooth skin. But I always regret it the morning after🙈
OMG YES. So happy for you, sister!
I got so much interesting fun facts from this video! You go, you!<3
Thank you for this important and brave video!
I always love your videos, but I think this one is my favorite one in a long time. You're awesome, keep it up!
Ingrid! Thank you! It's so important to talk about this. Everyone should feel comfortable in their body and not feel like they're being judged.
For my OWN personal preference, I like to shave it! I do it for myself because it makes me feel comfortable :) I like to shave it because it makes myself feel sleek. 
I think it’s so beautiful that you have the self love and respect to do whatever YOU want, and not what everyone else wants. Body hair is natural! It should really stay as PERSONAL preference. ❤️
I'm totally late to this video, but this is a topic very close to my heart. Personally, I don't shave regularly—probably only once a year (or less). My body hair doesn't bother me in any way. In fact, I feel more comfortable with it around—it just feels very strange to have hairless legs, underarms and, well, other parts. In my years of experience, my odour does not change with or without body hair, but my skin is a whole lot more vulnerable without it (especially the legs). To me, not shaving isn't exactly this huge statement; I'm just very lazy about it and it doesn't bother me at all. Also, I believe that if we're born with it, it probably serves some sort of purpose and I don't like to tamper much with nature.

No one asked, but I hope this can be helpful for someone.
Love this topic!!! It's awesome to see more women talking about body hair in a positive way! Also those vintage ads were so fascinating!
I feel so happy when I see another woman that doesn’t shave... it is like we have a connection of hair acceptance awesomeness....👯‍♂️💃🏽🧝🏽‍♀️🦸🏻‍♀️
I think you should do what you feel comfortable with. Personally when I see underarm hair I just think- ‘man’. But that’s because we’re not used to seeing it. I will probably still feel that smooth skin is feminine and pretty and I’ll stick with that.
I learned one thing about this video...I’m old. 😂😳 You go girl. 🙌🏼
I thought she had this video up before lol déjà vu?!
I don't even know why this is a thing.
❤ ~ 100% a personal choice ~ ❤
Well now I can really be your photo and video king lol great deals! Just tell yourself if a shave I must take 3 inches off those mini skirts you have at the alterations getting primed👍💕👍💕👍❤️
Before I even watch, I hope your answer is: because I don’t want to and don’t have to!
When I stopped shaving, I was surprised by how many compliments I received from other women. I’d be in the grocery store, reaching for the peanut butter, and someone would go, “yas girl!” It’s empowering. I also teach at the undergraduate level and the response has been good from my students, which I was initially worried about. I use a beard trimmer to trim my armpit hair— works great.
No worries, you're still so lovable and feminine.. 😍🤗💎
I am allll about free to be you and me. What makes you happy is what makes you happy and that’s awesome. But I just have to say, a period with pubic hair is so much messier. And smellier! I can’t be the only one who feels this way.
😭 never knew it was possible for you to be moore perfect. 🥰
Thank you for making this video! I loved learning about the background history on body hair. So insightful and interesting!!
I love you speaking your truth! Empowering women 🙏 can you do a follow up video of your journey in summer? would love to her thought ❤️ keep up your good work.
I work at Walmart and we keep ALL of our razors in makeup ! Just thought you’d like that 🙂
Love it! Well done! I hate the pressure and judgement around body hair 💛✨
Not removing my body hair, particularly my armpit hair, has been a 5 year long journey for me. I have thick dark Indian hair which stands out because I'm so pale. The amount of shit I've gotten from relatives and other women is insane. I'm still not comfortable having my armpit hair show in day to day clothes but I have gotten over the hurdle of wearing swimmers. Its all baby steps
You have hair on your head, why not anywhere else?! Just your choice! 🤗
Thank you so much for this video. This needs to be talked about and I think you did a really good job providing your perspective on it. I am pretty much on the same journey and I feel you about summer time. I am nervous too. Hopefully we can find ways to own it!
Yes, yes, yes to all of this Ingrid. I've faced similar reactions and thoughts regarding body hair, saying it's disgusting, dirty, or that I'll never find a husband with body hair (as if that's my life's sole purpose). I recently went to a concert and wore a tank top with a cardigan over it. Initially, I was concerned if it got too hot or my cardigan slipped off of my shoulders when I lifted my arms up that people would see my armpit hair. When the concert started, that was the farthest thought from my mind because I was having such a great time. I'm concerned about the summer as well, but hopefully I'll get to the place that whether I decide to shave then or not, it will be my choice. You're the best!
I'm so happy that you decided to upload this video! It's so important and more people need to be aware of these things. I stopped shaving in 2014 but in 2015 when I started uni I was judged a lot more. I wish that I knew what to say to people who shame me or ask me why I don't shave. Now I just don't really care, and neither does my boyfriend!
buy a beard trimmer! i know they’re aimed at the male market - but i bought one to keep my bush tamed and it works great! it has different length settings so you can play around : - )
All the support for summer time. It could be difficult but we have your back! <3
This is a great video Ingrid, thank you so much ! I'm really glad to see more videos on that topic every now and then, even though I feel there still is a long way to go...But anyway let's keep it positive ! You go girl !
I'm nervous about summer too, because I'm moving to a new place where it's always summer. But TBH I've realised that most people don't even notice! But I have encountered all different reactions, as you talked about .
Don't we live in a weird world if a woman who leaves her body natural becomes a controversy and we think of her decision as a "journey"? I love that you are so honest and clear about this, but at the same time I hope that one day, this type of thing won't have to be a topic anymore. For now though: thank you for raising it, because we have some way to go in this department.
I have to admit this was a very informative video.  I know in other cultures women body hair is perfectly ok.  Thank you for sharing Ingrid.  You gave me something to think about.
Keep it going for the summer!!! I'll subscribe when I see an update over the summer 🙌🏻
Girl, get yourself a Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor for your lady bits. It's a cheap and reliable trimmer and it's way easier than messing around with scissors! ;)
Perfection is you 💖💜💙
Damn you've changed a lot since I saw your coming out video
So happy to see a content creator apply critical thinking to beauty standards for women. I am impressed that you have taken the time to reflect on your personal beauty standards and understand how they have been affected by societal pressure and stigma. Thank you for being so responsible and informative with your platform! <3
i’ve been following you for soooo long and it’s so fun to see how you’re consistently growing and becoming more self aware/ loving yourself outwardly more. it’s so inspiring!! thank you for sharing your life & thoughts 💕💕💕
So informative, Thank You!!!
Just started. Really excited for this video.
so interesting, thank you for sharing!!
I found that my own initial reaction to you talking about the empowerment you experienced when you stopped shaving was immediately defensive. When I finally stopped these thoughts and truly listened to you and what you said, I felt myself let go of my own judgments and open up to new ideas. I always considered myself as progressive and supportive of women who don't shave, but I clearly still experience some kind of prejudice if I'm defensive of my choice to shave. While I don't shave often, I do enjoy smooth legs, I'm not gonna lie. But I do it for me, and that's ok. And all those who choose to shave or not shave are beautiful. Thank you for the opportunity for my own self-reflection and growth, and for continuing to educate people in a positive and compassionate way. I always say that your first thought is your programming, and your second thought is who you are. Deprogramming takes time, and you are helping so many people like myself to overcome society's effect on us. You are so wonderful Ingrid, much love! <3
I don’t care what anyone does with their body hair just don’t be angry that some people aren’t into it.
Thank you for making this video. You are so cool
thank you for speaking out about this! apart from its removal, i feel like body hair isn't talked about much, and if it is, it's talked about negatively.
thanks for all the knowledge!
Wow, you are so woke! I’m so inspired about how intune you are with yourself and how you question things about yourself like this. Especially when it’s so something that we don’t even question as a society like you explained, and I’m glad you put the history in cause that was super interesting! This is a great discussion and I’m really thankful you made this video. What an eye opener
LOVE THIS 💞✨💯
I hope you do another video updating us how the summer goes! When I first saw your Instagram post I decided to follow you on your journey. I've gone a little back and forth on the topic. But one day I know I'll give it a full 100%. Inspiring and informative video! :) <3
Ingrid, hope you don't take this negatively but what happened to your teeth? You used to have such white beautiful teeth and now they look like you just haven't had a cleaning in along time, don't mean to make you feel bad, just concerned as it can denote a health problem.
Yeah!!! 
Keep your body hair!!! 

I’m proud of you!! 

You look amazing with or without body hair. 

I actually wish that more women were like you and are brave enough to grow it out.
yes! thank you so much 💛💛💛
This is so important 💕💕💕👏🏼 You’re really brave🌷
Great stuff.  Thanks for posting.
You're fantastic! I feel inspired to try this too! An update of how it's going once summer is here would be awesome:)
Thank you for speaking out on topics like this and using your platform to have these important conversations!! You’re a great role model to young people!
Just a little editing feedback. This video seemed to have lots of cuts in the dialogue that became a bit distracting, from my perspective. Hopefully this is helpful!
I mean I'm a guy and I love shaving my legs 🤷‍♂️
I am proud of you for making this video because I know I would be very nervous about making it so I applaud you Ingrid. You're truly an inspiration
"it's been a GROWING experience"
Yoooo I was so excited to see you quote a GWS professor! I'm currently a gender and women's studies student at UCLA and a fellow body hair non-shaver, haha.
Thanks a lot for this video Ingrid, it's very interesting !
Everything - "All Natural"  = Super Sexy and Beautiful.  No Hollywood / No Brazilian ( however ) Do whatever makes You Feel Comfortable . . .Its your Body.
I got laser hair removal last year and I never looked back it literally changed my life
Yeah, I continue to be itchy even past the stubble phase lol! But, I have very thick/coarse hair & a lot of it, so I'm sure it varies depending on the person.
Thanks for the historic part.
If you had coarser or darker hair, i’m not convinced you’d be doing this. You’ve described the hair on your legs as “downey” and “soft” which is fine. If you had different type of body hair i think you’d have a different opinion. For example if you had lots of natural facial hair or a really dark leg hair, i doubt you’d happily be talking about your positive journey with embracing the hair.
Samson shaved off his hair and lost his strength.  Today, most men never shave the hair from their armpits or pubic area, but most western women do.  I think it disempowers us.  It keeps us looking like little girls, instead of the women that we are.
This is so so good, Ingrid! I love watching your constantly evolving curiosity; the way you are always thinking critically about your world! Such a role positive role model❤️
I've never shaved in my life and don't plan on doing it ;)
Thank you for this.
Ingrid, I have found that lady's trimmers work well for trimming any part.
You do you girl💗✨💗 love it!
Absolutely love this video! The cultural/historical context is fascinating. Would love to see more videos like this! <3
I really like this video and think it's something more people should be talking about. I'd be interested to know though how, if at all, you think your experience has differed from others being a gay woman?
I love that you made this video. I have been thinking about growing my body hair out for awhile. I have always hated how it felt like women only do it because society somewhere along the way decided it was the norm. My gf thinks it's gross but I find it kind of empowering. Thank you so much for sharing. Can't wait to see how your thoughts on this are once the weather is warm and you're dressing for Spring/Summer.
Ingrid, I just want to flood you with love and support!! I'm so happy to see you go through this content being brave, but real. I'm a grad student at ASU, so you also got me really interested in taking a class from Dr. Breanne Fahs! Thank you!! ❤️ 🧡 💛
Honestly I only keep up with shaving is in the spring and summer
You'll be fine! I know exactly what you're going through. I stopped shaving for all the  same reasons. It's so liberating! I waxed one last time before growing everything out. The hair grows thinner and time passes.
I absolutely love this video. Thanks for bringing up this very important discussion. <3 We need to ask ouselves why we do things, there's nothing wrong with whatever you decide afterwards, but let's just think about it.
I prefer to shave because it physically feels better to me - winter is difficult though because it’s cold and I always have goosebumps... 

But if someone chooses not to shave... who cares! You can be clean and fuzzy!
I just trim my hair with scissors. I haven’t tried using clippers because I feel like I would take it too far. When using scissors you can be very strategic about it. Love this video!
I don't think I heard this addressed in your video... what are your thoughts on facial hair?
Love that you went into the history of this ♡
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for talking about that!
I adore your curiosity and passion for learning and exploring new things ! Such a breathe of fresh air !!!! Keep it up! Your are one in a million ... never change !
It baffles me that people care about what OTHERS to do THEIR body. As if they get have a say in what a complete stranger chooses to do.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! Your openness is wonderful, Ingrid
love this video! body hair doesn't even phase me anymore. since starting roller derby i know so many people across all sorts of sexuality and gender spectrums and so many people don't shave!  when i first stopped shaving i was really self-conscious of lifting my arms or wearing tank tops. but now i can skate around the track waving with my arms high at a public game!
I love how thoughtful you are! It’s always a joy to listen.
I hope you know what an inspiration you are. I love it. I personally shave still. But I don’t mind it on others. In fact I think it can look so badass. Respect ♥️
If you’re interested in trimming just use trimmers. When you get some they will have different guard options for how much you want to trim off 😊
Love everything about this video!
I'm so proud of you for this.
Thank you for doing research. I'm wondering if you would make the same sort of video in defense of your choice of menstruation products? At some point, people wont freak out about peoples personal choice if we stop asking for everyone's opinion! You do you... and I find people stop talking about it when you dont invite it.
You do you girl but it's just not for me. 
I'm very cold natured and hair on the body and cold air is a no go lol 😂
Trimming would be a good idea just for comfort reasons. My boyfriend trims his arm pit hair! I was suprised because I'd never seen a guy to that before haha.
For pubic hair I like using a clippers with a certain length of guard that you prefer.
thank u so much for such an open discussion about body hair !!!! i try to shave as little as possible bc i love how fierce my body hair makes me feel, but sometimes i dont wanna show up to work (everybody except me is in their 40's loll) and that be the main talk of the day. Anyways, i love my body hair a lot body hair rules <3
If I feel like shaving I will but when I'm just chillen for a few weeks it's no big deal. It doesn't bother my husband at all so it's kinda like whatever. 
I don't find it dirty at all when I don't shave because at the same time most men don't shave at all and they are able to keep clean.. ya know. 
But I do like the way my skin feels when I do shave.
The razors in my dollar General are right next to the makeup
I don’t like the way it feels or looks so I shave. Personal preference. I’ve never related to having hair as a hygiene issue.
Omg my situation is just like yours Ingrid
yeah! living for body hair and feeling good in my own body as it is naturally
I had no idea that this topic is so divisive! I stopped shaving my body hair months ago after asking myself why I was doing it, even though I hated the entire process. The answer was because I assumed it was expected of me, and that wasn't enough for me to keep at it. The people in my life couldn't care less about what the state of my body hair is, so I never really stopped to think about what people outside my circle might think. That being said, I'm not gonna start shaving again. I've come to love the way I look au naturale and I've saved so much time/money lol


As far as trimming goes, beard scissors are the best! They're small and agile enough so you can get into most hard to reach areas. Just remember to be super careful with pubic hair. I use a tapered barber's comb when I trim to get an even length and protect my soft fleshy bits. I dread to think what a stray snip would feel like down there. 😰
As a tall girl, I hate shaving my legs (or really any part of my body). Its honestly to time consuming and it doesn't bother me either way.
Loved this video! As a personal experience I tried to shave my pubic hair to conform to social standards but never felt comfortable. Eventually I decided to shave only only on the parts closest to my legs and trim the rest of it and I'm loving the look and the feel of having nicely looking hair! BTW having a lot less itchy feelings and discomfort since having my hair back!
I have quite a lot of body hair and I used to shave, for at least once a week as the hair traps my sweats. Then I realise shaving is bad for my skin (like redness and other sensitive reactions). When it comes to shaving the underarm and pubic hair, it leads to a ton of problems too. After shaving, those areas get significant odour, they get really itchy as well. Turns out underarm hair and pubic hair is there to prevent germs from growing and creating a barrier between the outside environment (or garments) and our fragile bare skin. A bit of hair is good. To keep it hygienic, I just trim it from time to time with a pair of scissors (keep it short and fresh without destroying the whole 'ecosystem' in these areas).
Can't relate to any of this because I never have any armpit hair and I'm 27. I feel very weird and different from other people. Is it normal to not having armpit hair??
It’s a texture thing for me. I like feeling smooth. Lol It does also make me feel more well kept and clean and aesthetically, I like no hair except on my head and eyebrows. 😆But more power to anyone that wants body hair!
I love how honest you are about this :)
Absolutely love how you gave us that brief history of body hair!

I was excited to do the “no shave” thing after watching Raw Alignement’s video about it(last year).
Then, the bf I got a few months later commented on my leg hair by saying “It’s longer than mine!”. 
I caved and began to shave again.

When Freelee began her “club”, I got excited about it, but got put off by how strict she was on people doing it “for the right reasons”, so I deemed it as a trend I didn’t want to be a part of.

Now, I’m in full support of people embracing their true selves and accept that different people have different approaches to it and that’s fine! As long as I remain true to myself.

I hardly second-guess myself anymore because it gives me more time to focus on  things!
ingrid, i find body hair fascinating. my first year of college i had to do a 10 page paper. my instructor suggested i do something that i was curious about. i decided to do my topic on female body hair.  one of the things i found interesting was that during world war II body hair removal became widely popularized. this is because the soldiers would use panty hose as masks. in return there was a shortage in panty hose back home. likewise, the women were informed to remove their body hair, because there was nothing to cover their legs. pretty interesting stuff if you ask me!! 

thanks so much,
    emma
I love the fact that you shed a light on this rather delicate topic. Thank you! You help people understand this thing about body hair better, to find out whether they really want to remove it or are they just under the influence of society. Plus, I REALLY appreciate that you included the history aspect! I as a nerd loved it ❤
Yes, thank you!
Sometimes in summer, I trim, but when you trim your hair gets really stubbly and scratchy so use baby powder
Also I would love for you to update a video about summer and people’s reactions if any and what you do to make yourself comfortable
I just adored this video! It's such an interesting and divisive topic, I'm a shaver but thanks for making me question myself on this. Maybe it's time to ditch the razor....!
I’m so grateful for your videos, I really learn and grow a lot by following you 💗 You bring a lot of value to my life
I am curious, are you planning to wear bathing suits with your pubic hair grown out? I think it’s awesome either way, just curious!
Does anyone know that scene in Outlander (it's either in the book or movie I can't remember) and Jamie was appalled that Claire waxed all her bodyhair off? He said it wasn't natural to have NO hair anywhere but then he got used to it 😂😂
You can totally use scissor for the V, I never shave the V I only wax and if I’m not waxing then I just trim it with small pair of scissors
I would love if you did a video on trimming options once you figure it out!
Why is everyone making a connection to hygene? I have never felt or believe that shaving has anything to do with hygene, and neither has anyone i know. Is this an american thing? (as in american retailers portraying it that way) And out of curiousness: those of you who feel like not shaving is less (feels less) hygenic, how do you feel about men shaving? Do you expect and tell men to shave to or just women?
I have found cuticle scissors work well for trimming pubic hair.
so many youtubers that I have to watch at 2x speed x) people be talking as slow as harry styles
Kudos to you for exploring what your are most comfortable with! 
I think it should be completely up to the person and what they are comfortable with. I hate that shaving for women is taboo and that people judge you because you don't shave or decide to keep your body hair at different lengths as opposed to completely getting rid of it.
Wow this is great - I actually went through a very similar process, questioning the real root of my actions when I shaved and knowing deep down that the reason I was doing it wasn't actually for the 'smoothness' but because, like every other girl/woman I felt very very pressured to do it. It began to occur to me the strangeness of reaching puberty and then suddenly removing everything which is so natural and normal. I also started to question myself whilst in a fairly toxic relationship where my boyfriend would tell me to shave a lot etc... I now feel way more comfortable and content with my body as a result of not shaving, more me. I love seeing these stories online, it makes the whole thing more norma and hopefully encourages others to at least question the choices they make! xxx
I would consider myself pro-removal but now that I have watched this I want to think about the reasons why. Thanks!
I think leg hair would be hardest for people to accept. The armpit hair seems to be a bit of a trend and is also easily hidden by keeping your arms down. There are some women who have very light leg hair and it might even be cute, or at least inoffensive on them, but for myself the hair is sparse and sticks straight out and if I've gone maybe 2 weeks without shaving it I feel like it looks pretty gross on me.
yay body hair!!!!!! I'm glad u went on this journey w urself!!! i think knowing what ur body looks like with hair is a really great thing, whether or not u shave it off afterwards. i love my body hair and it always makes me feel like i have more ownership over my body in general! <3
This was so interesting... thanks Ingrid as always 💕 great and thoughtful content 👍I personally do shave as I feel better in myself to do it but this made me think... and actually my boyfriend is a professional cyclist and fully shaves his body too! (to do with cleaning injuries, the gear they wear and comfort etc.) Which is unusual for guys I feel so there's all sorts out there which I love! Big hugs babe 😘 xx
This made me think.... Please do a video like this about facial hair!
Good to hear you stand up for yourself and that you are happy! That’s all that matters after all! 😘
I wish your videos were available when I was younger. Thank you so much, everyday I learn to accept my body better & better from your videos 😘💕
I'm pretty lucky that I never have to shave. I feel ok with people's leg and underarm hair but if it's overly excessive especially armpit hair and starts smelling then I feel icky and either avoid them or make a very very brief interaction with them.
You are so well spoken! I really loved the mini history lesson about women's hair because it's something I've wondered about but never took the time to actually research. Everyone should be able to feel empowered to do what they want with their body and you're a great example of that. :)
Trim the top by putting a comb or pick to guide where you want to trim (like to hold/guide the length) brush from skin to the length desired, hold comb and and use scissors ✂️ or clippers trim up against the comb.. BE SUPER CAREFUL! Hard to explain In text
Many times I want to comment and feel dumb 😂 but here it goes to trimming our body hair
I've been growing out my body hair along with you just to see how I feel about it also (I've been curious before), and it's also been fine for me with the cold here in NYC right now, but next week I'll be in Florida on beaches, etc. with my sister for spring break so I'm pretty nervous about that. (both bc of just having the hair, and how my sister will react)... lol
Ironic how the ad the appeared before this video was for a hair removal tool 😄
I quit shaving about a year ago. I'm full on natural and completely comfortable with it. My husband says "comfortable is sexy" which I totally agree with. Dresses and tank tops... That's a little nerve wracking. I'm right there with you. I'm proud to hear you talk about it and the way you present it is awesome. Thanks!
To me it is a personal choice, I always hate shaving my body hair because I get really bad razer burns and it hurts so much.
yes ingrid! i’m so happy for you. and i’m glad you brought up the male gaze and how shaving is not actually hygienic. i stopped shaving 1.5 years ago and have found it so empowering.
If it were socially acceptable for women to have body hair, I would never shave or wax again! I find fair removal to be such a nuisance. You are so brave! Love it!  ♥️ ♥️ ♥️
You go girl 💪 I only shave My armpits and only when I want to do it. Mostly in the summertimes ❤️
That goat quote literally had me cackling. I mean it’s sad bro was so caught up in women’s body hair, but the way he said it cracked me up 🐐 😂
What about eyebrows, will you just let them grow out of shape too?
This is a very well done video!
Ingrid I think you are amazing. It’s such an interesting topic and so provocative for a lot of people, so well done for investigating your own feelings on it. Really interesting video and I’m really proud of you xx
I always shave my armpits I like having no hair there. Now my legs and nether regions  I leave until the weather gets better. And then I will shave the rest of it.
I liked this video. I don't understand why people are making any kind of deal out of this though. I don't even notice girls that don't shave and couldn't care less. I personally do because I like the feeling 🤷‍♀️
I see this is a really big deal for some people. Shaving or not shaving was a personal choice growing up and after becoming an adult and nobody cared one way or the other.
I stopped shaving gradually over years (I never shaved in winter anyway), but I haven't shaved AT ALL for a while now. The only thing I worry about is the hair that shows from the sides of a bikini when your at the beach. I do not know what to do about it and I am not confortable doing nothing, though at the same time I don't wanna do anything like that for others. This is definetely not the only uncomfortable situation with respect to body hair I've experienced, but it's the most disturbing for me (I'm getting used to the rest of them).
But I hate that I tend to show less skin now that I don't shave my hear, and I long for a time when I feel confortable showing any quantity of skin I feel like showing without even thinking about the hair.
Thanks for the video, it's a very important topic to talk about.
Loved the history part of this video!
I stopped shaving cuz im too lazy 😂😂
I trust you are exploring options about trimming and maintaining the hair we choose to have. Could you do a video on what you’ve found for armpit and pubic hair maintenance?! Thanks Ingrid!
And, whatever you figure out about yourself and others, it’s perfectly ok to have your genuine feelings.  Even if, in the past, you loathed it and thought it disgusting.  It’s not the healthiest way to feel or be but it’s genuine.  I hope you can find your perfect happy medium with this issue, the same way you break down and sort out other ideas you hold dear.

I’ve always been in the same camp you used to be...but not thinking hair disgusting, but I love to shave and do it every day in my shower.  I feel better after I shave and I don’t think it’s based in shame...I just really want to shave.  You’re such a good judge of yourself and each time you believe something you don’t want to believe, you sort it out for your own personal relationship with your body.  That’s awesome.
Honestly my armpit hair has scared the life out of me when I mistakened it for a spider 🥴
yesss 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I love the normalization of women's body hair
My shaving caused ingrown hairs and stubble rash. The itching was unbearable but I carried on for years. It was my husband in the end that said why do you bother. So I stopped best decision ever. Good for you 🙌🏼💗
Such a well done video!
As someone who doesn’t really shave cause I’m not really that hairy 😂 I really don’t care. Do you sis❤️✨
This was a very cool video! I enjoyed hearing the historical aspect as well as your personal experiences and honesty about your concerns moving into summer! I think it's cool that you're sharing your experience and inviting women to think about their relationship with their bodies / body hair. Rock on girly :)
I would never go to work with bare, unshaken legs... I'm so disappointed that I feel that way.
I made this desicion 4 years ago and i feel better with me
If I didn't do ballet and diving then I would grow out my body hair. But everyday I am in a swimsuit and a leotard and I feel really uncomfortable with even a little stubble showing anywhere. I wish I could be more free about it.
Body hair is just not a topic I have that many feelings about. Like shave if you want to and don't shave if you don't want to. I don't feel any differently whether I shave or if I'm hairy. Sometimes I'm too lazy to shave and sometimes I like shaving because it makes me feel more put together
I’m totally planning on doing a video similar to this with my story! I personally use trimmers lol!! It makes life easier! That way I don’t feel like a bush 😂😂. Appreciate that u posted this with your large platform bc it’s 50/50 if people get mad at you for it , at least that’s what I’ve found in real life! Thanks for this.
I’ll never forget when icarly said ‘what kind of woman doesn’t shave her pits’ abt that kesha girl djdj 😔 I thought I could trust her
I HATE shaving! But I will continue to shave my legs and pits. Just feel cleaner. 🤷‍♀️
Sometimes I shave frequently sometimes I don't shave for months, depends on what else I'm focusing on
I've stopped shaving around the end of last summer but I would shave if I was going out in public and I'm now nervous of not shaving when going out in public since it's getting warmer.
I too am not shaving just because I want to see what my body hair is like but I'm curious what your experience is with facial hair and whether you still remove facial hair or how to become more confident with facial hair?
You are 100 percent right Ingrid! Being a hairy girl has always been difficult for me. I was made fun of a lot and some people still point out the fact that I don't always shave as something terrible. I've had a lot of conversations with my friends about the topic and they get very heated. At the end of the day though I know that other people judgement is not what we should be focusing on and that's why I'll keep doing what I do and embracing my hary body 😊
Just wanted to add to the supportive side of the internet! I too am going through my own journey with body hair. Not sure if it's the same for you, but for me it's closely tied to my queer identity. Love ya!
I agree with you on this. It’s all about social pressure. I do it in summer because of this, otherwise I wouldn’t do it at all. In winter I just trim with one of my boyfriends old trimmers.
Well done. Honestly I am a swimmer and I have found it comfortable for me, my boundaries and so forth to shave or trim body hair, not because others have said to. When I don't train I don't trim or shave because I'm lazy.
I don't remove my hair and i haven't done for years, i think hair is a natural part of the human body and am all about being natural, my husband doesn't mind it either.
I stopped shaving when I noticed that razor bumps and burns are way worse than stubble. Also after I had a child I became more enamored with the amazing body I have because it allowed me to birth a human being! My concept of beauty has really evolved and so has my thought process, having armpit hair doesn’t make me less beautiful, I would rather focus on bringing out so much inner beauty that no one gives a rats ass about armpit hair!
Really though, like who is your therapist and can I have her number?!? I love that you're exploring this and are SO self-aware! xoxo
This needs to go viral. But then you’d have to deal with all the awfuls. Nevermind then. This is spectacular information and you’ve presented it so clearly and concisely
Did you see the show Broad City? I think it’s the first time I saw women’s armpit hair being shown on screen naturally! Cheers to that! Cheers to ilana! She rocks that! It’s when I realise it’s a topic that we need to be liberated. I also saw ur ig post on body hair which I think it’s extremely brave and inspiring for you to talk about:)
Been growing out my body hair too, love feeling free. The misconception I hate the most is that girls think that having body hair is unsanitary.
I think it's very personal and everybody's decision. But when you have so many subscribers you need to be careful do not promote such experience as most of the people are not ready for this change.
I have the opinion that each person should do what they feel comfortable with.  I don’t care if others shave or don’t.  For me personally, I have sensory issues with hair and cannot stand how it feels, I even keep my hair on my head very short as well.
As someone who doesnt shave and hasn't for 3 years solidly this video makes me feel not so alone!!
Thank you for this. I have struggled for YEARS with hating my body hair. I’ve had stress dreams before going to the beach in which I had body hair that was visible. I used to shave every day- sometimes even twice a day- because of this crippling disgust and fear of my body hair and what people would say if they saw it. 

But ever since you started this journey I have been inspired to try and embrace my body hair more too. I’m nowhere close to your comfort level yet (and that’s okay, every person is different) but I no longer shave every day. I think the longest I’ve gone so far is about two and a half weeks, which for me is.... astounding. 

It’s been difficult learning to accept something that, for 29 years I’ve been told to hate, but I’m getting there. Baby steps are still steps. 

So thanks, Ingrid. Thank you for being willing to share your experience with this and inspiring others to be more conscious of WHY we shave.
I’ve always felt like I’ve had way more body hair than most girls
I feel like you should do whatever you feel comfortable doing . It’s your body!!!
I’m completely fine with growing my body hair, I used to be very anxious about my arm hair (some people would point it out to me) so I actually had been waxing it. Now I don’t because I believe it is my body and I can do whatever I want with it. If I want to shave my legs I will. Both me and my boyfriend are ok with body hair. I really appreciate your video.
I have been a fan of Ingrid for years and years. I can even recall my favorite video of hers from I would say, 2013??, a spring time get ready with me. I would watch it over and over because it was so good! I am all for women doing what makes them feel good and empowered, but I can’t help notice something. After watching Ingrid grow and develop as a person, to me, it almost seems as though personal appearance to her is becoming less important. This is not meant to be negative or hateful in  anyway but as I watch her videos and scroll past her Instagram posts I see that the focus on makeup and even teeth whitening has become less and less. It is interesting to me that in her old videos these two things were so important to her. Who am I to say that they are not anymore, I don’t personally know her, but I do think that it is interesting that her ideas on those small aspects changed so much that she is hardly recognizable to me anymore. I don’t know, just an observation. Love this message and video though! Keep doing you girl!
Relationship to body hair? You have way too much time on your hands *
I don’t want to see your underarm hair. All of your adjectives are accurate. Disgusting and unhygienic. But you may have a man or find a man who doesn’t care. And, your feelings and his tolerance are all that matters.
Will you ever go back to shaving?
I love this, good for you
OMG toxic boyfriend !!
I  stopped shaving My legs regularly almost 2 years ago, i asked My husband about it and he said that why would he care about My leg hair? He doesnt shave His so why should i. I shave them when i myself feel like i want to, same with My armpit hair (and other hair). Do what makes you feel comfortable! 💐
I have been on this journey for the past year or so and I have had the some of the same anxieties. I was at a job interview and wore and ankle pant and didn’t shave and that’s when I knew, my body hair is me and that’s okay! 

Once in a while I’ll do a little trim, but just like a haircut on your head I feel that’s important! 

Thank you so much for making this video and using your platform to normalize such NORMAL things. We women need this! ❤️
I don’t feel clean myself If I don’t remove body hair🤨 I feel I don’t finish something
You kinda look like Lea Salonga.
I hate my under arm hair and pubic hair bc i do really feel dirty with it. I sweat quite a bit, so I do feel it more with the hair and, as a woman, I hate pubic hair SPECIALLY when I am on my period but just the overall going to the bathroom is really uncomfortable with body hair for me. That's the reason I'm thinking on having laser removal.
I’m a guy but I pretty much shave my entire body honestly I just like how soft my skin feels but I don’t mind if other people have body hair
While I agree with all of this, I think people worry about smell when it comes to hygiene because scientifically, you get body odour when bacteria comes into contact with hair follicles. So I think a lot of it also comes from removing hair to reduce smell.
I'm really looking forward to seeing more on your journey!  I've also been exploring my relationship with body hair, but as someone who grows naturally dark hair and loves dresses and shorts, lost my nerve quickly and shaved.  I haven't let it grow out long enough to decide if I prefer shaving or not.  Please post more about this topic :)
This is such a fantastic video. I hope more people come across this.
Bring The Bush Back 🍑🎄
I havent shaved my legs in 2 years and just started letting my underarm hair grow! It feels much better and I love looking at my body the way it is.
Why is this a thing? SHAVE. It’s not hard and no one wants to smell you...
Good for you Indrid! I don't shave my pits either, and I haven't gotten any complaints. The people who don't like it aren't allowed to be fully intimate with me.
Yayy, such an amazing important video! I haven't shaved my legs in about 3 or 4 years and I really prefer the look, but I do get some bad shitty comments, even from family mostly. :/ But good for you, Ingrid, nice for you! <3 <3 <3
This shouldn't be such an issue. Do what you want. We women always have to have drama. I could care less about who shaves and who doesn't. 
Really Ingrid, do your thing and stop stressing, there are bigger things in the world to worry about.
I'm really glad you're doing this. People are now beginning to talk about the detrimental effect of advertising, and influencers like you are effectively being the conscientious counter-advertising.
I use tiny clippers, like beard trimmer size, to trim my armpit hair and pubic hair. Stopped shaving my armpits several years ago.
I wish you luck in this journey of yours, especially when it comes to summer!
Just know that if you decide to shave during the summer months, it doesn't mean you have failed, or have conformed to "the norm" of what women's beauty standards are. In the end, all that matters is that you are happy. And if wearing certain pieces of clothing make you uncomfortable, then you should listen do whatever you think is best.

My personal experience: the only part that I always keep shaved is my underarms. We're all made differently, and I've discovered that for me I tend to sweat a lot there. So I've tried shaving and not shaving, while keeping everything else the same to see what happens. Turns out that my antiperspirant works a lot better when it has full coverage of the skin, with minimal hairs. Also, the hairs tended to wick the moisture up, causing longer dry times for my shirts.
As for the other parts of my body, I shave for fun, or when I feel like it. I see it as putting on makeup to feel good or sexy.
i love this video. thanks a lot
Good for you, Ingrid! Stigma against women's body hair is enormous.
i'm so glad you made this video and people are having this conversation, it was so informative and you can see the work you put in. i think every woman should try it for a while just in the winter to see what it feels like. when i started shaving in my teens i would stop every winter bc i only wore longsleeves and didn't wear skirts and i just didn't feel the need to. i've never done it in the summer unfortunately i care too much about what other people think but maybe someday?
Great video Ingrid <3
Also I wish you’d post this video on Instagram so I can put it on my stories! I wish everyone would watch this.
I have body hair and trim it occasionally lmao (underarms and pubic). I just use scissors bc it’s the easiest. I’ve found deodorant can get clumped sometimes in long underarm hair so I trim it occasionally and I’ve also found it’s nice to trim pubic hair when on my period). 
It’s so great to see someone talk about this stuff!! Love you Ingrid!
I have not shaved my legs in probably three years. I was pregnant and I honestly didn’t want to shave since I was not happy with my pregnancy. My daughter is 16 months now and I still haven’t. I’m single but if a guy can’t deal with any of my body hair 🖕🏼them. And I live in Wisconsin so in the winter tits COLD so it’s a warmth!!!!
Very interesting video.  I myself am on a similar journey. I basically don't shave during cold seasons but I really wonder what's going to happen next summer, how am I going to feel, will i be comfortable enough to keep my bodyhair as it is.  It's a work in progress, I guess.
Long message that likely no one will read (TW: sexual abuse):
Its so important to look at how body hair may impact someone who has experienced trauma.
Shaving body hair may be a way to cope with trauma, especially if, say, they experienced sexual abuse from someone with the same sex organs- i.e. if a person with a vagina is assaulted by another person with a vagina who did not shave, they may feel more comfortable shaving so that their sex organs look different (or vice versa). Someone may also not shave because that is an added "barrier" because we view that as "gross" often times in our society. 

What we may view as a social issue, many may view as something so much deeper. Bodies, identities, and feeling safe in one's body often impacts what we do to our bodies. Let's remember this while we are considering something a cosmetic issue- it may be much more for someone else. 

This has been your friendly reminder from your local mental health professional ;)
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 yes
Thank you for sharing this. I stopped shaving my arms early last year and I bleached my arm hair once since. I am still not 100% ok with my arm hair and sometimes feel like others can see it and judge me for it. I just hope that at some point I will finally be comfortable with it and not care what others think of it.
I get what women mean when saying "i do it for me", but it's still BS in my opinion. If nobody else in the world was shaving their body hair then you wouldn't randomly wake up one day like "oh, i think i'm going to do something for myself today and shave my pits!" Like, no. You might not be doing it to please a specific person in your life, but if society wasn't doing it, you wouldn't either. ((all "you"s are general))
Ingrid, you do you boo boo. I don't care who does what to their own body, it's. your. own. body. you know? Who am I to ask you to conform to what today's beauty standards say is beautiful? It's natural. I personally like to keep up with my underarm and leg hair, simply because it itches, even when it's fully grown. But like I said, you do you. I'm sure things will turn out great for you. Best of luck on your new journey! 😊❤
I think the younger generation is challenging the common norms between men and women. I think waxing places like European wax Center and Unikwax might downsize in the future as more younger women are challenging social norms. Everyone should do themselves. Remember....an original is worth more.
i stopped shaving my legs about 2 years ago. it's like a weight lifted off my shoulders. although, i think i'm lucky because i'm ginger so it's not as evident that i have leg hair.
i stopped shaving because i got laser hair removal.
I shave my legs maybe every 2 weeks in the summer, in the winter maybe once every 2 months. The pits it's whenever it gets long like every 1-2 weeks. I just let the private hairs do their thing, and use the gillette trim style trimmer for physical comfort in that area. I keep my private hairs because I know it's healthier for my vag, which gets unhealthy easily anyways. Always looking out for my vag, & being at peace with my hairs!
She and Maia Mitchell could be sisters
I have always had pubic hair, I feel very uncomfortable without it, but there are definitely trimmers made for women. I have the Schlick hydro trim style, it has a razor on one end and a trimmer on the other- personally I love it so I would recommend it for sure!
I support you and your journey!!! 🖤🖤🖤
I let my leg & pit & nether region hair grow for weeks and then shave because it gets super long lmao. I don’t like when it gets caught on clothing when working out. So it’s like whatever I’m feeling.
When I was younger I DEFINITELY didn’t like my body hair showing much because I was in ballet and that shows through tights and ballet is all about clean lines it was a no go. 🤗🤪 SO, now that that’s not my world anymore...I just go with the flow. 
I don’t know if it the hair adds extra warmth for me in the winter but I made myself believe that somehow and it makes me shave less?! Hahahha. It’s fun to know I’m not the only one who has thought about this in detail.
As always a loyal subbie, I love you and your honesty. Xoxo ~Dolly
gotta braid it.
Thank youuuu for this video! It was so educational! I don’t shave my body hair, I honestly feel cleaner when I don’t. I haven’t been shaving for about 3 years now!
I think i just prefer hairless for ME n my body. But at times I dont shave my legs for a couple of days. I think it all boils dwn to wat u feel comfy in and dont let others influence  ur decisions. *of coz positive vibes only.
You are fantastic. Gives me something to think about....decisions to come.
Thanks for this!!!
its just so shocking that in this superficial  perfect instagramable world something completely normal like body hair is even a topic to talk about. don't we have real problems in the world? in earlier times people died of fighting for human rights. nowaydays you are a rebel if you show your unshaved armpits....
As someone who is pretty set in my own opinions about body hair for myself, I still loved this video and learning about the history behind these trends. Would love more videos like this!!
Hair is hair it doesn't bother me at all I have never been bothered by my hair I am super sensitive to razors so I would rather have hair and not but breaking out!
I haven’t shaved my legs since September and honestly I’m really loving it! I’m also nervous for summer but seeing how angry people are in the comments over women choosing what they do with their bodies makes me even more determined to stick with it. Thanks for speaking about your journey xx
Ive never felt pressure to shave. I honestly have fully grown hair everywhere but my armpits. I personally sweat quite a bit from my armpits. On the level where I can't wait tight long sleeves or short sleeves. I just realize that I do honestly sweat more when it gets more grown out. So. I shave it! Don't know why people care so much.
Its crazy that people think body hair smells but hair on your head doesn’t smell😂🤦🏻‍♀️.
Im a 22 senior chemistry student and I dont shave! I feel the most judgement when I tell my lady friends this ahh. Im just as clean as the next person I just have more hair yet people think that is gross for some reason? I think my hair is very feminine, we grow hair differently than men and in different places
Thanks for making this video and sharing your experience. Couldn't have been easy. I like the way you went back in time and gave a history rather than just saying "Ï stopped shaving". Don't think I am quite at that same spot that you are at. I actually like shaving and like the process and how it makes me feel but I might decide to stop one day. Good luck on your journey! :)
because its hella more comfortable i mean
Thank you for making this. Definitely a struggle I’d like to explore. There is so much subconscious shame with body hair we don’t even realize why we do it or why we think we like to be hairless.
Defensive people in the comments, she mentions you at 8:16.
This is brilliant! I remember being 13 and not sort off realising the norm was to shave when I did have the realisation and realised all my classmates were I immediately went to the bathroom and shaved every inch of my body! It’s crazy to think that the reason I was doing this as a thirteen year old was for cosmetic reasons when I was the only one viewing my body. I think sex Ed classes should make it apparent that shaving is not nesscecary but optional.
U were on we day Tacoma wermt u??
I am on the same journey as well, but as I live in thesouth hemisphere, is summer here! I thought that I would find it difficult to handle, but in fact I found out that nobody but me has to feel good about my body, so I just went with the (internal) flow. I think that not only hair logically is a synonym of youth (grandmas do not have hair anymore!) but, if you are healthy, they are shiny and soft, which is nice. Personally, my hair used to grow from night to morning or viceversa (really), so the itchy part was just at the beginning of the process whereas it used to be EVERYDAY. What others think may seem the issue for ppl who find it gross, but an empowered woman is way more attractive, and if one accepts the whole being is when one is the most.
Did ya'll even watch the video? Ur comments are pretty well explained through watching what Ingrid has to say. Aaaannnd if you KNEW what this video would be and knew you would hate it why even watch tbh???
Do you still pluck or wax your eyebrows though?
I have raised this topic many times with people in my life too as I believe it to be deeply unfair that women are expected to go through such extra lengths that are both time consuming and uncomfortable in order to just appear what is perceived as normal. I wish with all my heart that women could all come together and make this a permanent change. Thank you for speaking about this on your platform. I am grateful and it has spurred me on to try keeping my hair this year too. X
This has nothing to do with the topic but have you ever consider combing your hair with the line to one side, sorry if this makes no sense, I’m not sure how to translate my thoughts into English! Instead of having your hair line in the middle try a bit to one side, I believe you would look very cute!! 😊 just a bit of something!
Sorry but I don’t really want to see anyone’s hairy arm pits
I’ve always Shaved/ waxed since I was 12. I just thought it was ugly and I loveeee smooth legs and armpits. 
When it comes to pubic hair I was always BALD. 
But then I dated someone whom did not enjoy the baldness and he asked me to please let it grow. 
It was at that point that I was like “oh this is not so bad” and now that I’m not with that person anymore I have “the guilt” that I have to keep it bald BUT I DONT WANT TO lol like yes bald bikini line but I want hairrrrrrr on the top. my current partner doesn’t dig it so I feel stuck. UGH  I still shave my armpits and legs tho I appreciate those being smooth.
I love this topic because I always thought body hair was awful, but then I kept finding that the guys I dated never even cared and I realized I don't have to meet all the idealized beauty standards to be acceptable :)
you're so pretty
For the last two weeks I always forgot or didn’t feel like shaving my legs and my boyfriend and I had a good laugh about how I almost have as much hair as him 😁 He actually really enjoyed stroking my leg hair 😁
it’s not that deep. everyone should just do what they personally feel like doing. it’s your own business and no one else’s.
Good for you. Not for me. People should be able to do what ever they want with their bodies
I have really dark, thick and long hair. As I was a teenager classmates used to laugh at me, because I didn’t shave. Then I came home and cried. My mom bought me a razor so I could shave. Only then I felt socially excepted.
Until today I kept on razing. Meanwhile because I like the feeling of smooth legs and it looks nicer than long thick black hair growing profusely all over my legs and in my armpits. I feel more comfortable and “cleaner” because there is just skin, not hair. If I would grow out my leg-hair you wouldn’t even see skin, just hair:D
It’s not that I’m not confident with myself and my body. I think it’s just a Routine you keep on going without questioning it.
So...that’s my story. I really admire your confidence about body hair. I really appreciate your videos. I like women being comfortable and speak up about these touchy topics.
Great video! I still shave my legs because I just really like it, but I stopped shaving my armpits and pubic hair. It was especially like liberating to stop shaving my armpits, as I had a lot of problems with the razor irritating my skin.
Have you heard of the song "Map of Tazmania"? It talks about hair and not shaving in a positive light.
Ingrid, I loved this so much. I feel like I can't really put into words how mich this resonated with me, but just know it did. I'm on a very similar journey as well, so you are not alone. Also, let a girl know when you figure out trimming. Can't quite figure that one out yet, lol. But I would love to hear about updates when summer comes around. That's something I also still have nervous feelings about, even though I am pretty open about not shaving. The one time I did wear a shirt where you could see my armpit hair, I got quite a lot of negative remarks, so I am v nervous to attempt it again.

Keep being you! Once again, this video was just so freaking good <3
You are a brave soul! I salute you for having consolidated a position in life where you are strong enough to question essential questions of femininity and identity! Go you!
Thanks for sharing your story. I shave occasionally, but mostly I use a trimmer (a bikini one) and I love it especially for my pubic region, as I never shave there, my skin is too sensitive. Even if I wax, or use a removal cream, I end up with razor burns -_- so I just trim and honestly no one has said anything, looked now there with disgust, etc when I'm in a bathing suit. If that helps your fears any.

I am still shaving my legs and underarms in the summer though, but I'm thinking of doing the same for my underarms and just doing the trim. I wear lots of linen pants and maxi dresses so on those days I won't shave, but I'm still unsure about the days I wear shorts. The thing I try to keep telling myself to get over the fear is: men do it all the time and we don't care. But we shall see how my summer goes ;)
I like being hairless cause I like they way it feels and look, i don’t do it for men or for society beauty standards of women and I get extremely annoyed with women who feel everything they do is in order to please a man or society, if your not doing it for yourself first and foremost then you need to re-evaluate your life, what I do with my body is to make me happy not a man or society, some women are genetically blessed where they don’t really have to shave cause they don’t have body hair and just have pubic hair which I feel you don’t have to shave and while I also feel you don’t have to shave pubic hair, I don’t like either and prefer to shave it but I shave pubic hair as much as body hair cause I’m extremely sensitive in those areas and break out and get ingrown hairs really badly so I don’t shave that as much and more so just groom it so it’s not too out of control lol but if it was up to me, I’d rather be completely hairless cause that’s what I prefer but again I don’t care whether a woman shaves or not nor do I think they should be made to feel like they have too, as long as your taking care of your hygiene that’s all that ultimately matters, do what makes you happy men and society be damned, if they don’t like it, that’s their problem find you a significant other who won’t care and still love you just the same
Trimming is cool, but can you explore the stigma of female leg hair? coming from an openly gay cig male feminist ❤️
I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want to shave. It is in fact a cleanliness situation, lice is definitely still very much an issue and always will be. I just don’t get your reason which is fine. I feel like any trend people can create or find, that goes against the “norm” people will do it.
By the same logic, you should also stop doing your eyebrows... 😬
The point about razors belonging in the beauty section was a cool point I hadn’t ever thought about. Personally I don’t think shaving should be a ‘feminine’ thing. I think guys should shave their underarms & legs too. #equality
This was a great video to watch. i really started to think about WHY i like shaving, WHY do i shave? do i even WANT to shave? though, to me, i find it part of my self-care process and i enjoy the feeling, you've given me the thought that i dont HAVE to do it if i ever feel like i dont want to for a bit.
You always have some thought provoking and fun topics to get us thinking.Your underarm hair is lovely. I'm pretty over shaving my lady bits and legs. But the pits I can't get over that prickly stage. It is like my biggest pet peeve to have the prickly under there. It makes me want to throw up like nails on a chalk board. Much love Ingrid!!!!💟
My straight guy perspective- I fully respect an individual woman’s choice to go against social norms, in this case growing out armpit hair. Just like I fully respect an individual man’s choice against social norms to wear skirts in public, every human being has the right to choice! 

Having said that, do I find women’s armpit hair attractive? Absolutely not! What a turn off... Sure, i get it’s my own social programming. But I have the right to feel that way while respecting the choice.
Your body your choice :) Who cares about traditional social expectations for women and hair
STOP MAKING It A THING IT IS NOT !!! It’s gross disgusting even for men .. idc women men in between it’s still disgusting !!!!!!! Please shave no one wants smelly sweaty people at the gym
I love that you do this. I wanna do it so badly but at places like the gym... im already uncomfortable. Do you wear just a sports bra at the gym or put on a shirt to hide your under arm hair?
Awesome video! Thank you for talking about this!  I agree, you should be able to choose what to do with your body hair without feeling judged.  I'm pretty hairy on my arms and back. I have tried waxing but my skin breaks out in rashes so instead for summer or special occasions I will dye my arm and back hair. As far as my privates it depends on how I'm feeling. I tend to sweat a lot and hold odor in my armpits so I will shave there.  As far as pubic hair goes, I only trim and shape.
Btw... letting your grey hair show is also very controversial for women. People think you are lazy and letting yourself go.. You wouldn't believe how hard I was judged for not dying my grey hair.  After 5 years I finally dyed it because I chose to. I've learned to not care what others think anymore. People will always judge. What's most important is that you love yourself and are happy with your choices.
Thanks again!  Sending you lots of love! 💜
I just hate that people act like if you hate your body hair it's because of outside influence. NO. I dont hate my hair because of men or because of anyone else. I just think personally on me its yuck. I dont like how it feels, it gets in the way, it's dark and grows uncontrollably and I just dont like it. My thoughts only not anyone else's opinion.
Don't, men shave daily due to social norms aswell?
Right on brave one! I would rub my teenage shaved legs for prickles .  Now everything is downy soft.  I still have shaving scars grrr
I did the Broadway tour of Cabaret and when the choreographer told me all the girls couldn't shave our armpits, I was mortified. A month in though, it was so incredibly freeing. Being able to be the way we are made and not hiding certain parts of ourselves was truly liberating.
I don’t really shave my legs during winter and my boyfriend doesn’t mind at all and it doesn’t bother me but I struggle with underarms as I’ve shaved for so many years that the hair is very thick so it’s irritating when it starts to grow! I regret starting to shave things as the fine hair probably wouldn’t be noticeable now!
I feel like i might be going against the grain here, but really? I hate to say it but WHO CARES? I mean, girl, I'm all about doing whatever brings me joy (which Prickly pits are definitely NOT it) . But i feel like the only reason women are even willing to talk about this is because a few influential women, models etc. Are speaking out about their pits and pubs and growing them out and then making a controversial reveal on social media. I swear when one does it a million follow and then "say" they have always been against it. or why sexualize shaving? Why make it about gender..... my gosh. Same old song and dance. Shave, don't shave but why make a massive deal about it?
I am naturally quite a hairy person 😂 i gotta it from my dad i guess hahaha and in secondary sch i would get comments abt my my arm hair because its dark and obvious. It did make me feel conscious of it after that but i didnd do anything about it till about 21 when I started working. I still find it such a hassle to remove arm hair but do it anyway... when you think about it, its just body hair and why should we have to remove it when its really such a natural thing 😕
yeees! i have been thinking about this topic a lot lately and questioning why i really remove my body hair.  and i realized that i dont know any woman personally who doesnt, even women that don't like to wear make up and don't care too much about their physical appearence in other ascpects. and that almost everyone started when they were like 13 (including me) which to me is such a creepy thought. we already feel pressured into this when we're little girls! 
i feel like in the last couple of years there has been a lot of talk about self love and feeling comfortable in your own skin and that we should feel pretty without makeup which is all very nice and important but almost no one talks about body hair. even though the same principles apply. we should be able to feel pretty even though we have body hair everywhere but  no one i know  feels comfortable with body hair. so thank you so much ingrid for using your platform to share your experience on such an important topic!
Do you Ingrid! 👍
yay, go you!!!
Who cares? Good God. People are so self-centered nowadays that they post videos talking about why they stopped shaving 😂 People need to stop being so focused on themselves. Goodness.
Ingrid, you are so real and I so appreciate it. I personally like shaving and I have never felt like I am pressured to, but there have been a couple instances where I have but I also just in general like the feeling of having shaved legs and armpits so stopping shaving is something I have never really thought about. I so appreciate that you are doing this for yourself and I recognize that so many people have had the thoughts that you have and it's amazing that you are refusing to conform to what society and other people tell us is acceptable in terms of shaving. I love you so much!
I grew out my body hair last summer and I got sooo many looks, questions and comments, even after I had waxed it again. It’s shocking that how another person “keeps” their body is so controversial. It was hard, but honestly I haven’t regretted it, it was a good experience and I’m more relaxed with my body hair now. It did show me however, just how deeply rooted those social norms still are. 

Ingrid, thank you for often bringing up these topics that noone else talks about, I love that you’re starting the conversation in the YouTube community, the beauty part of it especially.
Aslong as the person is very happy with either shaving or not, that's the matter, dont let people judge, I shave when I feel the need not when I want to
I use scissors for pubic hair and my armpits! I keep a pair in my bathroom for my pubic hair and disinfect them after. I don’t want it all there, but shaving is itchy and sometimes painful for me! I do shave my arms and legs because I love that feeling on fabric. Thanks for talking about this! People comment on my armpits a lot, but oh well 🤷🏽‍♀️ That’s some sensitive skin.
What happened to your teeth?
You could shave for the summer and then be a fuzzy bear for the rest of the year! Haha!
Perfect timing. I have an ingrown hair in my armpit and it hurts super bad. I usually shave my armpits regularly just because when I've gone months without shaving, it seems slightly more sweaty and u comfortable but the ingrown hair issue is super inconvenient and I might suffer through the occasional sweat. I usually also keep pubic hair because of hygiene. I've found it to be more unhygienic to shave pubic hair and it leads to higher regularity of UTIs. I trim with a male electric razor (trust me, I've tried almost everything) and it's pretty quick and easy when it gets out of hand. I have a safety razor (shout out to low waste) for my legs because I purely like to occasionally have smooth legs. That's completely a personal preference and I have no problem either way with body hair. I have found so many people that DO have a problem with my body hair and it's very confusing because ????? They don't have to touch me or even look at me. Thanks for making this video and sharing your journey!
I've recently stopped shaving as well ( or almost at least) and I find that I like it a lot more. I grew out my armpit hair and then shaved it once and found myself wishing for it to grow back immediately. I do like having shaved legs but I now haven't done it in months. And it feels good. But I am like you where it's winter and I'm not sure how I will feel in the summer. 
If you find a good way of trimming the hair please share because the few times I've done it, it has not worked out as the hair gets cut straight off and won't have that soft pointy tip, it will get really itchy but I would like to shorten the hair once in while.
But thank you for sharing this 😊
I never thought about razors being in the hygiene isle versus the cosmetic isle. It really makes shaving seem like a necessity and not an option. I can't believe I didn't notice it sooner! Ugh I REALLY hate that! I also think it's interesting that men become "manlier" when they let their hair grow out, and women are put in that box as well. Even though we're a different sex, society doesn't see women with body hair as feminine as women without; we become "manlier" as well. 

As far as trimming goes, I like to use clippers. I don't keep my body hair quite as long as yours, but I use clippers on my armpits and pubic hair. It's SO easy and quick! I like that it makes my body hair such an afterthought because of how quickly I can do it and how few times I feel the need to do it. 

What advice would you give to someone who, like yourself, doesn't want to shave, but their partner is pretty in with societal norms?
All I can say is: first world problems. 🙄
So interesting and digged trough! :)
lol my bf just broke up with me because he saw I was growing out my armpit hair and called me a disgusting slob... i'm like nice CYA
I shave about once a week in the summer time (legs and underarms). The rest of the year I only shave if that area will be exposed. As I've gotten older I definitely care a lot less than I did. My husband doesn't care either, and I personally think it's important to think of your SO when making these choice. Even then though, it's only a consideration and your happiness should come first.
Love your honesty
Let me first say, I have no negative feelings about body hair or not shaving, BUT: as a microbiologist, I must correct the false information. More bacteria lives within a hair covered area, than that same area, free of hair. It's science. Therefore, shaving is not only cosmetic, it's also HYGIENIC.
Thank you so much for talking about this! I feel much more comfortable and less stressed when I’m letting my body hair grow. It’s one less thing to think about. For some reason I haven’t made the leap to letting my armpit hair grow - I don’t know why! I’m gonna reflect on that. 🤔
I really appreciate you making this video and adding so much historical as well as personal thought into it. I do think shaving and doing something like wearing makeup is a personal choice. Having said that, as someone who does both of those things, I actively think about why I "want" to and what is influencing me to do so, even subconsciously. It's a complicated topic and I appreciate you adding input to it. I'd love to hear your thoughts about this regarding makeup vs shaving!!!
YES GO GIRL
I definitely DEFINITELY notice getting stinky faster. As for my legs, I usually don't care unless I m being intentional about having it shaved. I do wax my mustache, eyebrows, and armpits and I like it better that way. I am not gonna police other people's hair though.
Can you do a video about why you no longer take care of your teeth?
So I actually grew out my leg hair next summer and it was an interesting experience. First off, my leg hair is dark and dense, so, yes, people can definitely see it. The thigh part is naturally a little less hairy, but the lower part was very visible. I also did shave the inner thigh (pubic) hair part, because I did feel uncomfortable about it showing when I was wearing a bathing suit. I should also say that I live in Germany.
The reactions were diverse. Most of my friends were very supportive and accepted it with no problem. The one issue I had, that also pissed me off the most, was that my mom commented on it. She said, it didn't look nice and just couldn't understand why I was doing it. We had a huge argument that ended with me crying on my bed and being comforted by my brother (who didn't care or didn't comment on it either).
Later on, my mom and I talked it out, but it was scary to see my mom, who usually is very open and accepting about many liberal issues, be so closed-minded and actually bullying me (even if it wasn't really her intention to hurt me). Actually, after out talk, she was very proud of me being confident enough to not care what other people thought about it.

Anyway, coming back to this winter, when I also decided to not shave any part of my body anymore. I quit shaving my armpits, complete leg and pubic hair. That was also when I got together with my boyfriend, who, upon seeing me naked for the first time, really didn't care at all. The one thing I do, is trim my armpit and pubic hair, just because it's a little more comfortable for me.
I hope I'll keep doing this when summer comes around, but I just want you to know that if you're having doubts about shaving, because you're scared of what other people might think, just try it out. I think it definitely made me more confident and made me worry less about what other people think of me.
The people that truly love you, won't care what you look like!
I go extended periods of not shaving, but I feel best when I am shaved. I hate long pubic hair, it can make bathroom trips messier especially during shark week, when my leg hair grows out it snags on my pants (but I don't shave above the knee, my chunky thighs are just hard to shave and the hair is fine there) and especially with winter my armpits don't really matter and I find them easiest to shave. Lately I've noticed one or two reoccurring dark chin hairs on my face and I hate them. When I tweeze them they're tough to tug on, really set in there. A normal person probably wouldn't notice them but I hate looking at them.
You are amazing. I am on the same journey and have very similar feelings, keep asking if the anxiety and desire to shave comes form myself or from imposed beauty standards. I am leaning more towards the latest one lol!! Also wondering about the summer. Anyways, amazing reflective message and love how you are trying to stay present, for me trying to live in the eternal present moment is what had shed some light on those type of topics, you start witnessing more “yourself”   BTW now that you are in NYC highly recommend the school of practical philosophy, look it up! Is very interesting :).
I admire you Ingrid, you are so brave! I’m thinking a lot about this lately and trying to figure out what I want to do for myself. Thank you for this encouraging video, summer will come.. and go! You’ll be fine! :)
I feel like this whole thing is reaching so far lol like you’re trying to discover your feelings and ‘culture’ but having hairy armpits?
This is really interesting! I personally am ambivalent towards my own body hair but nervous about other people seeing it and being rude so I tend to leave it in winter then shave in summer.  I have very light fine hair that seems to stop growing after about 3 weeks so I guess it’s not as scary for me as it might be for others! I do think it’s important for it to become normalised though so we have a real choice with no judgement either way
I am growing out my underarm hair because I freaking want to! I quit shaving my pubic hair a year ago and still shave my legs. I don't personally like leaving hair on my legs because it's uncomfortable. Loved this vid!!
Love this!!
I think in Egypt removing body hair wasn´t gendered, so it was something both men and women did. Shaving/depitaling is not just a product of men imposing a beauty standard on women. It is actually not any crazier than any other cultural  trend.
Sorry but I can never imagine myself growing body hair 🤭 I just love the feeling of smooth hairless skin 😬
I’m glad you brought up this subject. I have a tough time with subject. I have very sensitive skin. 
I do not shave in the winter.  I do shave in the summer.  But that is on a need to basis. If I’m not wearing shorts 
I may skip it . If no one can sees  it who cares.  
Thanks Beth
Shaving is annoying. You should try waxing or sugaring.
truthfully i dont mind the hair but just keep it maintained and hopefully you dont have second thoughts about facial hair. anyway if you are looking for a hair trimmer i recommend a ceramic blade trimmer like "brio" or "manscaped."  i know its made for men but who cares.
There’s absolutely no benefit of having armpit hair or leg hair! 0. we’re not living in the wild. Pubic hair questionable for health reasons, but the rest of the hair is absolutely useless!
Tbh I saw the thumbnail and thought "oh here we go, another girl growing out her hair for attention" but I watched it and found your reasons for wanting to explore having body hair are great! Personally I have very light coloured body hair so genuinely forget to shave, but I do notice that if it gets too long it feels uncomfortable so it's a balance :)
This video helped me feel less alone. I am currently growing out my body hair (everywhere) and I, too, am nervous for summer. It's fine in the winter but I know that I will have to reach a point to where it is exposed and that scares me. We'll brave the judgment together Ingrid! <3
You go, girl! It gets less nerve wracking over time! I started growing out my under arm hair in December of 2015. On occasion, I’ll trim it with scissors, because I still like some length on it, but there are times I want it a little more groomed- like for certain jobs I’ve had.
People truly do have huge reactions. In the end I just brush it off because why do you care what I do with my body? It has no validity in my life. The only time I get a little anxious about it is when I’m dating someone new, but the people worth my time and attention have either said nothing or have said positive things. A lot of my friends who were iffy on the idea of it have since lightened their opinions on it too. I feel like I’m doing the world a service by softening everyone up to these sorts of things.
I live in Florida, and love when I see another woman walking around with a bit of pit hair! Over the years it’s gotten more common. It feels like we’re in some sort of special club.
You go girl!
I mean you do you. And this may sound mean not trying to be ......but it feels like this pseudo intellectual thing.
Thank you Ingrid for this! I stopped shaving more than two years ago. I don't want to shave, first because it has always been an issue for my skin, I've got even dermatitis from shaving. I can't tell how painful it was! But I still struggle with showing my legs with hair... we've been literally brainwashed. Thank you for bringing more awareness in women's life!
I am a waxer. I see body hair all day and it doesn’t bother me one bit. However, women who come in with full on bushes (I’m talking haven’t shaved in 6 months to a year) ALWAYS have a strong odor. No matter what anyone says, hair traps odor. I experience this every day. Clients who come back after their first wax day “oh my gosh I feel so much cleaner and have much less odor”. So I would at least recommend trimming. (Just for Brazilian and underarm area where we tend to sweat) . Let everything else grow wild if you wish to do so 😊
Yeah you quoting Romans who were an overly sexualized culture where it was encouraged to be promiscuous.
This is an amazing video. Thank you. Women and men should have equality with body hair standards.
''Why I stopped shaving'' - because that's what lesbians do...
First of all,  thanks to bring this to the table. The fact that you are sharing your journey with us and being honest about what you used to think is super valuable. I haven't shaved in more than half a year and it's been amazing. Last year for my birthday I asked my dad for laser hair removal and now my legs and armpits are as hairy as they want to be. I've been hairy under my comfy winter clothes but also wearing shorts all summer long at a summer camp and haven't felt more liberated that this.  Happy to see more people it's letting themselves feeling this way. Thank you much <3
This seems like a very touchy subject but as long as people understand we do whatever we want with our bodies and they respect that, it shouldn't be. I had laser done in my mustache, armpit, half leg and bikini.  I did it because I see it from the point of stopping skin infections from the razors and ingrown hairs, and also because I got a pretty sweet deal.  Now, the hair comes back but its so thin and soft that I don't even bother trimming it if I notice it. One thing that I noticed after months was how it had changed my approach to having sexy time with my boyfriend; it should not matter but we all know you want to feel sexy to your partner and even when he never bothered it bothered me. Now I can be more spontaneous because there is here but it is so thin and soft that goes unnoticed and it has changed the flow of our relationship a lot. 

I feel the problem comes from our response to male opinion. And I get it, we want to feel desired by men. But my boyfriend also shaves his pubic hair (because it makes him feel comfortable) and I find amusing and frustrating that people don't police on his decision. This is a patriarchal subject that comes from everyone trying to decide what is best for a woman. So we should just let the woman decide and stop the discussion there.
To be perfectly honest - I prefer the look of clean shaven; on myself and on other women. I just like the look of soft skin more than I do the look of hair. That said, I don't like putting in the work - at all.
Ingrid, you have absolutely no idea how much I admire you. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us, I know how difficult that can be. I have a big issue with body hair, if I don't shave it I feel extremely uncomfortable and dirty and I can't get anything done because it's in the back of my head annoying me through the day. I've tried at least four times to stop shaving (specially my legs due to my hair growing up extremely fast) but I've failed each and every time. I'll keep trying of course and I won't stop until the day I feel fine with my body hair in general.
😳😵😲
i grew up so poor we couldn't afford to use disposable razors all the time so i just eventually stopped a couple years ago(to the dismay of the other women and men in my family). people will say all they want but it rarely bothers me anymore. saved a lot of money too, you really don't realize how much money you spend on things you don't need til you stop paying for it.
That was a really one-sided history. What about all the decades, countries, and cultures that embraced body hair? It's not completely taboo. It's not revolutionary to keep body hair.
this was really interesting
I remember when you posted this on instagram, people were so mad calling you unhygienic and gross and smelly like people were so triggered! And that’s exactly why you need to keep talking about, to normalize it. Because most of these negative comments were coming from women, we’ve been so trained to believe that female body hair is gross and unsanitary, when it is no different from male body hair
Why do women who don't shave always feel the need to let the world know?
Ingrid is like a cute little grandma 👵🏼 ❤️
I absolutely love this! I stopped shaving my leg hair about a year ago - at first, I did it as a challenge, but now, I love my leg hair and don’t want to shave it off. I love that you are doing it, too, as it makes me feel better and comfortable about my choice. Sometimes, I get scared or self concious about my body hair, but knowing that you are doing it too makes me feel more brave :)
Start with maxi dresses for the summer :)
She's just trying to show how society has shamed women for having body hair and the fact that it's a normal thing that we have. That being said, we all have our own preferences. Also someone who truly cares about you won't care about your body hair
peak white feminism
Great content 👏🏼
I stopped shaving this time last year and, while it was an odd adjustment both physically and emotionally, I am happy to say I'm never going back! Women deserve to spend more time on lasting self-cultivation and less time working towards beauty standards that we won't have a chance of embodying in a few decades.
Love this!
I personally don't like my body hair, but lately if I have some leg hair that I grow before I wax it, I still wear short skirts and just let it go and I became a lot more cool with it. I really appreciate you sharing this and doing only what you want with your body! This is so important that you posted this!
Girl you’ve gotten really weird lol
Very good, respectful and interesting video.
This past year I have been on this journey with body hair too. During winter all was fine, and now that it is summer y have been shaving but intermitently, I usually shave when I know I will already be out of my confort zone so as not to add "what will they think of my hair?" to the useless thoughts. I guess my confidence will keep growing and will eventually not care about that even when I am putting myseld out there. On a daily basis, I am fine wearing shorts and having a some hair show.
I love this!
I’m too lazy to remove my body hair, but  I wish I feel comfortable showing it in public. I always avoid raising my arms in the subway but sometimes I forget it and I feel soooo embarrased😭
What's with the sad dramtmatic music Jesus Christ get a life it's not that deep
Men and women have been removing hair since ancient times. Also there are women who don't like their male partner's hair either, so I know men who feel pressured to remove their body hair (especially chest, back, pubic, and facial hair). Personally, I love the all natural look, but don't want it for myself if that makes sense.
I do shave my armpits, because I actually do smell worse. It almost feels like the sweat is penetrating the hairs because no matter how well I wash (daily) and what kind of soap I use, it just gets smelly and it gets worse the longer the hair.
I only shave my armpit hair only when im gonna wear sleeveless. Nope i dont wear deo and i dont have body odor. I leave my arms and leg hair alone. And last i trim my pubic hair by only lightly shaving not to the extent of the roots.
WHO ELSE LOVES HER VIDEOS💓






 
Omg... so over this 🙄
My body doesnt like when i shave. it causes so much irritation so i try not to shave. i do shave but its rare
have hair don't care    xoxo
I really appreciate that you are even having this conversation with yourself! People keep or get rid of their hair for so many different reasons and they are all personal! I personally do not shave (and haven't for about 5-6 years) because my skin is so incredibly sensitive. Even if I do all the right steps and am careful, I will always get some sort of razor burn or rash. The grow back period is always uncomfortable and a lot of the times painful for me so it's not even it worth. (it's the same for waxing just on a bit of a smaller scale) I am lucky that when I was experimenting with body hair I had a community of people that were so encouraging and body positive that it was easy to feel accepted and feel comfortable with it, but it wasn't for another year or two that i felt comfortable being in shorts and tank tops, or even bikinis without feeling self conscious. It's a journey!
I don’t normally comment on your videos but I will say that it is important to do what you feel is best for you. I don’t like body hair on certain aspects of my body because it attracts odor and frankly, some men could benefit from doing the same. I don’t think it has anything to do with gender but hormones. I think the very idea of “hating” one’s own body because it’s hairy or whatever else is a bit outlandish. We are indeed mammals but just like we don’t need our molars, we don’t need everything that naturally occurs on our bodies it’s just evolution, something that once aided us in surviving certain climates and to prevent us from having certain illnesses. 

Let’s not make this something that’s life changing like the diva cup or simply not wearing a bra. It’s not that big of a deal.
Body hair is kinda disgustang :P
“How to be relevant”
Great topic! I prefer hairless underarms usually when I’m wearing something sleeveless but I prefer plucking instead. Otherwise, it really depends. I sweat easily and I live in a humid tropical clinate so having smoother underarms really tones down the BO for me.

As for the rest of the hair on my body, I really don’t have an issue with it growing. Sometimes I’ll shave my legs when I feel like it. But it’s not something mandatory for me even when I’m wearing clothes that show off my legs. Pubic hair, I trim every once in awhile. Never tried Brazilian or any form of waxing in that region.
The girls who said their boyfriends and husbands make them feel bad about having body hair makes me so sad. Men are so disappointing, wow.
Ingrid, this is something that I have never extensively thought about, so thank you for making it. With ANY social norms coming into question, I think that the journey can sound familiar for those of us who step outside of the box and ask: why is this the norm? Am I going to go along with this social preference? Why are the people in my life so defensive about this?!  <- this question in particular baffled me when I decided to steer towards a plant-based diet. I can't wait to see how this journey unfolds for you into the warmer months. I admire your willingness to explore this!
Ingrid thinks that she single handedly will change the course of history and make everyone love bushes in their pits and groin lol. Ingrid you can enjoy your stanky pits, but that’s not something women will ever want!
Funny enough, since the mid of October I’ve stopped shaving my armpits which is the longest I’ve ever gone. I didn’t do it as a resistance act. I really just didn’t see the point in shaving during the winters. But this was the longest iver ever held out on shaving my armpits so I was fascinated in observing its growth. Now, in March my hairs are long and soft and I am genuinely so happy seeing them! And the thought of summer approaching gives me conflicted feelings because I was planning on shaving starting summertime but now I’m not sure if I want to. I want to not care what others think of me and MY BODY HAIR but after decades of thinking otherwise, it’s hard to suddenly change other night (or in this case, 4.5 months). 
I wasn’t sure how this video was going to be, I was wondering if it was going to be berating. It wasn’t. At least to me it wasn’t. I enjoyed hearing another women’s struggle with growing it out and then realizing summer is ahead. 
🙄 The struggles man.
Hi Ingrid! I’m so glad to see that you’re going through this journey. I think it’s fantastic to see another woman questioning beauty ideals in this way. 
I myself stopped shaving or removing any body hair when I was 15 years old (I had started at 12). 
One day I just realised that I was shaving only because I thought I was supposed to and not because I actually wanted to. Now I’m 27 and I love my body hair, I actually think it’s pretty sexy. 
I take confidence in the idea that, if I wasn’t supposed to have body hair it just wouldn’t grow.  
You said you’re worried about the summer and having your body hair showing. From my many years of experience people barely ever notice and if they do notice, no one has never not once said anything to me about it. And remember, I was hairy in high school! It never came up as a problem. I do sometimes catch people staring at my legs, but they never acknowledge it. I just think ‘if they feel weird about it, it’s their issue, not mine.’ 
Just FYI, my body hair is a lot longer and more noticeable than yours is right now. ;)
Good luck on your hairy journey! I hope one day you feel as comfortable about it as I do.
Good for you. Everyone should embrace whether they want body hair or not. I personally must have my underarms shaved, even if I go a few days without I notice that I do have more odor there whereas normally I have no problems with that. So that's cool you haven't had that problem! I shave my legs maybe weekly during the winter and more in the summer but i love the feeling of shaved legs especially under sheets haha. Pubic hair, honestly I don't usually shave that either. I do 100% trim though, but when I have shaved I get lots of bumps and rashes. So ouch no thanks! I have a friend who does not shave anything at all and when she explained her point of view on it i was kind of grossed out in the beginning. But the more i thought about it the more I realized that that reaction is solely because of shaving being a social norm and expected of women. So kudos to you for doing what makes you feel best.
Omg I have so much to say and I never comment on videos. Firstly HELL YES. I went through a very similar journey. I'm 23, in a relationship and do not shave my armpits. And I feel so sexy and feminine as a girl with armpit hair. Don't know why, but I do. And I love that. I also stopped shaving down there and only wax my bikini line. Again, I think that's HOT. My legs for some reason have been the hardest to stop. When I see my hairy legs I just think they look masculine and still shave them. Would love to get to a point where I don't care but also LOVE that I can choose to shave one part of my body and choose to never shave other parts. I have so much love and respect for women who don't shave. Going against the norm and feeling uncomfortable at first is the ONLY way to create change in the way see perceive body hair on woman. Thank you so much Ingrid for sharing this. You are amazing!
To much philosophy over body hair.
I haven’t shaved anything in a really long time. I have light body hair that’s thin so I really don’t feel the need to shave. I don’t really have any difference in body odor. As far as down there odor, that’s what vagasil wipes are for! :)
I use a beard trimmer with a guard to keep things the length I want. 
I have been on a journey to grow out my armpit hair as well. I did last year until I was in target and I was so embarrassed about lifting my arms I couldn’t buy anything. I just went home and shaved my arm pits. I have found it’s easier to avoid chemicals if there is some hair in my arm pits. I just use coconut oil to help keep down the bacteria and let the hair do the rest. I can’t do that if there is no hair. I still shave my legs if I want to be sexy for my husband, which tells me I still have a ways to go in feeling comfortable with my own hair. But I don’t want to ever buy razors again.
Omg I went through the same stuff!! Best option I found for trimming are the battery operated trimmers on the other end of a razer. It's a good size and easy to use. I use the razer end to clean up my bikini line in the summer only and I don't do my legs and I trim my underarms and pubic hair.
no more shaving, as she says wearing her makeup lolll but really so then, we could say the same about makeup. Eh, I’ve always treated shaving nonchalantly anyway, and never has anyone cared. I shave sometimes when I feel like, just like when I only Sometimes wear makeup when i feel like it and sometimes i don’t bc i dont feel like it. (And they usually only occur on the same rare occasions.) Especially thru graduate school, i could go months without either of those things simply bc it was never a priority nor something i had time to even think about. I don’t think people actually care in real life, people on the internet just hide behind a screen and their own insecurities.
I find myself watching this and just thinking... "Really?" Is this all you have to think about? "My feelings" towards body hair. My personal feelings about my body hair. This is the research Ive done on body hair. I go to bed at night thinking about my body hair. Im nervous about summer time because my body hair. LOL whhhhaaaattttt??? Girl, people have full time jobs, mortgages, child support, making ends meet, loved ones over seas, addiction. Like real life issues. Problems. And your biggest problem is trying to convince yourself you want body hair. If you want it fine, but lets please not make think a life altering thing. This deep meaningful issue. Your loved ones are probably not disgusted by the hair, they are probably just like.....really?  Get a life girl.
I used tweezer when removing under arm hair. I told my husband why do women need to remove their armpit hair when men are not required to do it and no one will judge them. But at the end of the day i still tweezer my armpit hair.
To each their own and what someone does with their body is their own prerogative 👍🏻 I find myself not caring about growing out armpit hair, I almost forget about it. However, I love the feeling of smooth legs so I shave my legs, as well as some of my pubic hair but not all of it. Again, it’s just something I enjoy.
Perfect example of how everyone has different experiences with body hair and how it’s entirely personal based on preference. My experience wasn’t the same. when I grew out my hair I was extremely smelly no matter how much I washed. My hair seems to hold oder. No matter how much I let it grow out, it was extremely itchy rubbing against my clothes on my legs and under arms. It got to the point of extreme pain with ingrown hair and it pulling on my underwear where I was in physical pain trying to sit. These are the reasons why I remove my hair, for personal comfort. Everyone should be able to experience their body hair with out fear of judgment. It’s important to do what’s right for you, not everyone else. Thank you Ingrid! Always a pleasure watching your videos <3
Yikes
One time i went to the beach whith my legs natural is a chaleng but feel great
I shave because its comfortable. I do it mainly for comfort! I don't understand how you think growing out your armpit hair, pubic hair, leg hair is comfortable, but you do you! :)
💛💛💛💛💛
I think what you did is really great people, especially woman, should be totally free to choose if they want to keep their body hair or not without judgment from anyone else. Im really glad that my husband is totally fine with body hair on me as sometimes I go through periods of time when I shave and sometimes I dont at all.
So she’ll be wearing shorts and dresses with butch hairy legs?. Nice! 😖
I participated in No Shave January this year, and that month was by far the longest I went without shaving my armpits and legs. I initially wanted to extend the No Shave to the pubic area, my belly, and my arms and fingers as well, but that was just too much for me. I'm so freaking dark and bushy; I've only ever seen exactly one woman with the same amount of body hair as I have, and that was on YouTube. So yeah, I just couldn't deal with the overly bushy pubes. It was unhygienic for me to grow it out THAT long. As for my belly, I absolutely hate the sight of my hairy belly. No one but me ever sees it, but I personally hate it so much that I have to remove it. As for my arms and fingers, I'm extremely self-conscious about the hair I have there. I couldn't let it grow out, and plus, I think it looks very odd and way too masculine for me (who is very feminine-presenting and is of a very delicate body type). It just doesn't fit me.
Anyway, I did successfully grow out my armpit hair and leg hair for the first time. Yay! I didn't hate it. I think my legs didn't look very pretty (again, too masculine for my body type), but I was surprisingly fine with my armpits. But it was also very satisfying to remove it all again after the month was over. I just prefer the smooth look and the smooth feel. I'm not sure I want to grow it out again, as shaving it all off took soooo long. I will, however, likely not shave as often anymore as I used to: Maybe twice a week is a fair deal. I used to do it every single day in the summer and every two days in the winter.
Its funny but I didnt feel bad about body hair until my mom told me I had to shave. Kind of interesting to see connections within history and fashion, but also how its passed down through families because of this. Honestly I like shaving, I love the way it feels and I take that time to check in with myself and have the time to let my mind wonder. Came to some great conclusions while shaving hahah
to each their own ya know? I prefer myself shaved and smooth because that's how I feel most beautiful but sometimes I'm sick or on my period so I don't shave for like 5 days and that's okay too. Do what makes you feel good
Loving you. Thank you for being so open and honest. I have been fully comfortable with showing my hairy legs for years now, but I am still working on the confidence to wear tank tops with my hairy arm pits. It is so weird how society molds us. I’m rooting for you and for all of us who still feel the need to shave, pluck, wax and hide a part of ourselves SOLELY for the sake of others opinions. 💗
She looks like Willy Wonka
LOVE THIS!
Personally, I haven’t shaved my legs for nearly 2 years. Sometimes I feel self conscious about it, maybe 2% of the time. 
I don’t know why, but I still shave my pits. Haven’t been able to shake that social norm. 
Pubic hair, I previously had had laser, so it’s thinner but there’s still plenty of it. I use a trimmer. Sometimes a swim suit is awkward. I have shaved the sides from time to time in the summer. But left the bulk of it. 
SO SO PROUD OF YOU FOR SHARING THIS. It couldn’t have been easy, but it’s great that someone so public and influential on young people can start a conversation like this!
Thank you for the vid Ingrid! I get so angry towards (mostly) men saying that body hair on girls is 'so gross' and that women always have to be smooth everywhere (one male friend of mine says this often and it really pisses me off), because it's unattractive, off-putting , a turn-off and/or dirty/unsanitizing. Their view on body hair is totally formed by the media and modern advertising/fashion and pornography industries. If body hair on women was just as normal as it is on men, this whole discussion wouldn't even exist.


I don't hate my body hair, I can let it stay put the whole winter; I don't care. Only in summer I will make an effort and that's purely because of the 'norm' and me feeling insecure having hair in public. I hate hair removal, it's tedious. My hair grows insanely fast, is dark, thick and I have a sensitive skin which gives me irritation in whatever way I try to remove it (or let it do it for me). That's the only thing I hate about summer. Winter for the win!


Again, thanks for putting this topic out there!!
i started growing my leg hair out 2.5 years ago (at 17) and haven't shaved it since, i do sometimes feel societal pressure in the summer but with time i have managed to still wear dresses and feel comfortable in my body. my armpits are a different story, i have tried several times but always disliked the feeling of hair there. i am currently trying again and it's going well so far, we'll see if i stick with it this time :) thank you for your open and honest video, i have felt many of the same feelings as you!
why I disliked thi video, do you even have to ask?
Relationship to body hair? Omg so dramatic.
I don’t understand the USE of schaving
Seriosly You dont any topics for your channel anymore and you just talk about hair. Omg disgusting srsly
So proud of you @Ingred Nilsen! Such a hard move for many, I think people underestimate it. I'm not there yet and still personally like what I look like shaved more and cover up if I'm hairy in summer, but maybe one day! The history has definitely made me think. You can do it in summer! We believe in you and you're really making a positive difference here in the world from something that seems small.
I've been experiencing a lot of what you're talking about! I prefer to keep my body hair, but trim it in the parts of my body that it grows thicker, and sometimes lighten the color of the hair in my legs and arms. Shaving it completely makes me extremely itchy. I still have situations that I'll use clothing that reveals it, and makes me uncomfortable and apprehensive for the reaction of others, specially living in Brazil, where it's such a huge cultural feature, and also warm whether all the time. It's definitely a process, and I hope it comes to a day when I am fully okay with it, despite of the length or color. Meanwhile I discovered some stuff that I never thought about, since I have always shaven. Like the feeling of the wind in my leg hair, it's crazy to me that I'm just now getting that sensation, and men had it all along!
you used to be cool. what a shame
This!!! ❤️ I stopped shaving about two years ago. After letting my hair start to grow out I didn’t wanna get rid of it anymore. It started with my armpits, and then slowly made my way to growing out my eyebrows, then upper lip, then legs....  at first I felt really insecure about it. 
Most women I know who don’t shave only wear long pants/long dresses, and if they’re going to wear anything else they’ll shave.  And being non-white means people treat you different and assume you don’t understand the social culture here etc. 

It’s so rare to see women with dark, thick leg hair in public. Which is why I knew I had to do it! I was inspired by others and I knew that other people would only have the confidence to do it if they see it’s possible.  
I do definitely get stared at sometimes, but it’s all about being brave. After a while you won’t be insecure about it anymore. Cos f**k what strangers think. I’m less insecure than when I did shave, no need to worry about stubble or pubic area or buying razors and stuff. No need to waste shower time and water. More time to just look after yourself!
But I totally understand how scary it can be for many people. That was me for a long time. There’s no pressure to shave if it makes you uncomfortable or you don’t think you’d like to stop. But know that the option is there and totally fine if you don’t want to shave, it’s worth trying x

PS: it’s so much better for my eczema!
Too bad trich has taken the best of me 😕 although I’m getting much better.
those summer nerves are real
I shave everything else except my underarms. I find it really uncomfortable because my hair grows super fast, so if I shaved my armpits in the morning it would be spiky and uncomfortable by night. Other than that I just love the soft smooth feeling everywhere else. There is a certain shame I feel if I wear a dress with stubble on my legs, let alone full on hair. I just feel like people are assuming so much about me because of that and so I shave it so that doesn’t happen. Shouldn’t feel that way, but that’s what most of us have been raised to feel.
Interesting video :) I'm deffo in camp 'you do you' for basically everything tbh (unless murder) 

Thought on the razors in 'hygiene' isle - both men and women use them; i would assume that it started out as a 'shave for hygiene' and razor companies probably can't be bothered to rebrand them to 'aesthetic'. Also, there's not a 'men's beauty' section so why would they bother moving it? It would make sense to move women's razors to beauty as they have the pink tax which isn't as glaringly obvious in a diff section to men's razors. 

My theory on why it's in hygiene is thus: young men have traditionally been clean shaven (Roman) = respectable until VERY recently. the rise of the hipster and designer beards and stubble has become the new norm and you can still present a very tidy looking face to appear professional. I remember when I was little thinking beards were very much disgusting and gross; imagining trapped food in there saved for later etc. Now I immediately associate a man bun and a well kept beard with 'knobhead' (interesting reaction to dissect in my own time) but it's not one of 'ew dirty'. 

Just some off the cuff thoughts; I'm not saying having razors in hygiene is necessarily right, but I can see why it's there and there's some interesting diffs on body hair between the traditional genders.
this is too funny, i'm kinda doing a similar thing. i always get lazy and don't shave as much in the winter, but this time over my school break i just straight up didn't do it and then i kept not doing it, and now i'm kind of curious to see how i feel about it. i had similar (though not quite as negative) feelings about body hair. i don't know how long i'll keep it up, but for now, it's working for me. (the winter thing is a big factor, i'm curious to see how i'll feel in a few months). rock on ingrid, it's awesome to hear more women talk about this.
💖
Love this!
so i shave pretty frequently both my legs and pubes. however, if i don't shave my legs because i didn't have time or whatnot i don't really care. With my pubic hair, if i don't shave it i do feel more self-concious about it. i used to shave most of it before i met my boyfriend. He doesn't like the look of bald genitals, so i started growing them out (he didn't force me, i choose to do it). I still shave a little my bikini line and just groom them every now and then. with regards to trimming down the hair that i always keep, i do trim it with scissors, i feel like a smurf if i don't. but yes! scissors all the way. 

Now for my armpits, i pluck the hairs out (guilty pleasure), but lately i haven't had much time to do that with work so i haven't been doing it, i do feel a bit self-conscious when wearing tank tops but oh well. o try to not think too much about it.
Ok, I LOVE that you are talking about this!!!! Such an important issue! It makes me so happy to see women having conversations about this topic! Honestly, I haven't shaved my legs for 5 months and it does not bother me at all. It's winter, so I don't care since I'm wearing pants every day. BUT...I do want to challenge myself to change my mindset on body hair in the summer months. I think that will be a little more of a challenge for me, but also an important learning/growing experience.
I am very comfortable with leg and pubic hair when no one but me (or my bf who's used to it) gets to see it but have never grown out my underarm hair... I kind of want to try it because it's strange that I have NO IDEA what my underarm hair would like if I left it alone for over a week. Also I am terrified, like visceral reaction terrified, of going out in public with my dark hairy legs. I wish I wasn't but also don't want to be personally responsible for fighting societal expectations of women on all fronts all of the time, so shaving it is for me.
When you feel comfortable with your hair, life gets easier .I think that means this issue is big. Thank you for talking about it. 
I don't shave my body hair at all in winter and I shave it when I feel like doing it in summer, which ends up to be like once or twice. haha This is the way I find the easiest and comfortable. I go naked and enjoy hot springs with my body hair! No one seems to be care, or maybe someone does, but I just don't notice.  There are many right choices out there. It's more fun when we get to know and respect other right choices :) I'm looking forward to your new videos!
As a WOC, I have very thick and dark body hair. growing up, especially in middle school, my classmates started shaving, talking about how gross they felt with so much hair on their bodies (even when the hair was very light, barely visible and quite thin). They treated it like something that was just part of growing up, like driving and getting a job. I hated wearing shorts, i hated wearing tank tops, and swimming for high school gym class was a nightmare. I’m finally at a point in my life where I’m more comfortable with my body hair but I still have a long way to go. Thank you for posting this video and your additional sources in the description, it makes this journey a lot easier! 💖
I always shave my calves and shins and my underarms. I don't shave my thighs except on my tattoos because the hair there is so blond it's white and it's very thin. I used to shave my pubic hair when I was younger however it always itched the day after and I would get razor burns and ingrown hairs like crazy. Honestly thinking about shaving my pubic hair just makes me feel itchy. I just trim it shortly every week or so. But I do this because of personal feelings. I don't like the way long pubic hair feels up against underwear so I keep it short. I honestly don't think anybody should be shaving their pubic region bald, it's there for a reason.
I love you for this. About the same time this video came out I stopped shaving my arm pits as well. I am human too and my fear for my leg hair is real. I like the feeling of them being shaved bc, unlike u my hair on my legs, now from having shaved them my whole life, is black and prickly. Maybe I should think about bleaching it and doing routine sugar, exfoliant scrubs to get the same effect <3
I stopped shaving my arm pits 6 months ago when I used a natural deodorant and got a really bad allergic reaction. Once my pits heal, I was honestly kind of lazy to shave. I’m confident with or without body hair
i'm thinking of growing out my armpit hair as well! i already don't shave my legs in the winter, but for some reason underarm hair is harder to accept. my dad hates the fact that my legs are hairy, so i can't even imagine what he would say if he saw that i had underarm hair. i'm scared of people's reactions, but i figured that growing my underarm hair out now would be the best time since it's winter. excited to be on this journey with you! it will definitely be a process to overcome the internalized disgust i have towards my own body hair, but i want to learn how to appreciate my body in its natural state <3
I stop shaving every time I go to jail.  It's a nice refresher and after it grows to a certain length you feel a sense of accomplishment.  It's almost like a competition with yourself, like how long can I grow this shit?
Ingrid, not trying to undermine the importance of this video or your personal experience. But my initial reaction...... hope this makes someone laugh, balls smell bad. Association by genitals I guess, that is what popped into my head. I was imagining what I would do if someone with any gender identity told me that body hair was related to odor..... and I just went straight to balls. Maybe that's me being defensive, maybe it's a double standard, maybe I have just experienced weird balls. Anyways, love you bye.
It’s part of a lot of people’s hygiene routine. It’s just like how you always have makeup or your hair done for events, etc. so it’s not completely crazy for people to think it’s unkempt for you to not do it, because every other hygiene/beauty routine step is just the same
I quit shaving this year and I love it. Of course there were times before I wouldn't shave every day but I was pretty ritualistic with it. I had no desire to do it but didn't want to be seen as gross and dirty mainly by men. I had to really examine my feelings on this and why it made me feel so unnatural to be in my very natural state that I truly loved. It seems silly now to even think I let it bother me so much! But this is what happens in a society obsessed with female "beauty" which is truly just control and consumerism.
I’ve been growing out my body hair for the past couple of months, too. I’ve never liked shaving but always did it anyway because it was expected of me as a woman. Then I just stopped. It’s really nice not to have to shave anymore and deal with the stubble! My partner doesn’t mind either.
But I’m also really really nervous about summer 😔 I only recently moved to a new city for university, so I don’t have any close friends yet I feel completely comfortable around. I don’t want them to think I’m gross or something.. I personally don’t feel that I am but who knows what their opinions are about female body hair 😟 I don’t know if I’ll be confident enough to keep my body hair when summer comes... anyone else in a similar situation?
100% vote for a trimmer. I don't shave mine because I get horrible ingorwn hairs, but I do trim on occasion. Seriously not keen on putting scissors anywhere near my lady bits 😂
I love this video so much. My skin is super sensative and no matter what method of shaving i've tried i always break out and itch. Trying again and again has been such a waste of time and money for me. Once I started going to an arts highschool i saw a lot of women (feminine and masculine) with body hair and they looked confident and great and they were completely accepted. Seeing that made me want to try it because I never shaved because I wanted to, only because i felt a societal pressure to. I began shaving my legs in late elementary school when i had felt ashamed of my hair when comparing myself to other girls. Even since then shaving has been painful for me, and i just don't think it's worth it for me. I'm so glad more women are embracing body hair because it has been hard for me, but videos like this really help out.
As a guy, I do not care either way if a woman or a man shaves, and I just shave my face or trim my beard if I grow one. The only time I have cut my armpit hair was pre-surgery, and then it was done by a nurse.
Do people still even shave? Razors are horrible. Just get laser treatment and you will be done  with hair forever
OKAY WTF HAPPENED TO YOUR TEETH
You’re my hero❤️
I shaved my legs in HS because I was occasionally teased if I didn't. After I got out of HS I literally didn't shave anything for YEARS because I hated shaving, and also I really didn't want to be doing something because society said so. Since I live in the PCNW it is easy to not shave and not have people notice. I got really into yoga, and was going to classes regularly a few years ago and noticed that other women gave me really odd looks because of my body hair. So I sort of had a reverse experience- and explored shaving. Admittedly this was partly because of how I felt people looked at me in yoga. It didn't take long for me to realize I hate shaving my armpits, I feel like I am stinkier and sweatier without armpit hair, and also it's just a weird-hard area to shave successfully? I equally enjoy freshly shaved legs as I do fully grown out legs, but dislike stubble-y legs. So I usually shave my legs in the summer/spring. 
As for my pubic hair I shaved it once, and also hated that experience. I am happy to trim it as needed.
omg am i the only one who thinks she kinda looks like kourtney kardashian ?
🤭🤦🏻‍♀️
I shave it in the summer, not so bothered in the winter. If someone said I HAD to, I'd let it grow and plait it in the summer just to annoy them haha.
I have a wierd relationship with body hair.... I will go for months without shaving if I know no one will see it and I'm comfortable with my own hair but when the summer rolls around and I'm wearing different clothes or if I'm about to see a guy then I have to shave otherwise I'll worry what other people will think and I'll convince myself that it's disgusting.
Yesss, I’m in the exact same place right now. Super happy with my body hair, super nervous for my first Southern California summer with it all hanging out. How do I even wear a bathing suit without grossing out everyone around me? Time will tell, I guess. LOL!
I think razors are in the hygiene aisle because they’re typically sued in the shower / bathroom.
At home I wear sports bras and shorts and I'm fine with it. I'm pale but with dark African hair so when I'm outside I feel that I'll be judged as not feminine if I have body hair particularly because other aspects of me are less traditionally feminine. Hair shouldn't feminine or masculine but I find that the people who see my body hair are my intimate people and I've invited them to see it. Like your friends coming over and you're in your PJs. You don't want the public to see you like that but if you've allowed someone to see something about you which is less "done" then I'm ok with it because you've let someone into your space
I stopped shaving a couple years ago, when I took acne medication that made my skin really fragile. I felt ashamed of my body hair for a really long time, but still i didn’t start to shave even when I was off the meds. I simply knew that I didn’t want to shave, I liked my hair even if I was ashamed of it at the same time. So what I wanted to say was that seeing you talking about it and embracing it, makes me feel more validated and less alone. So thank you.
I really think this is a very interesting topic and it is one that I'm concerned about. I think that it is so sexist that women are brainwashed since a very young age about having to shave to be good enough. I wish that no women feel the pressure to shave just for what other people may say or think about her. We should be free to choose whatever we want to do with our body without he influence of stupid ads among many stuff. Obviously, if someone wants to shave that's more than OK as well. I have to say that I currently shaved my body because I do not feel confident enough to stop doing it, but if I feel no pressure by the media I will not shave my body. To me, it's great that each time more women are not shaving and are doing what they really want to do with their bodies. Ingrid as well as other women are an inspiration for others. I really enjoyed the video.
Thank you for being so open about body hair! I come from the stance of "you do you." I'm sharing TMI, but in the winter I let my hair do its own thing, and trim up when things get unruly. I've actually been lucky and never had any of my partners complain (even the ones who are were fashion oriented and all about the clean shave), and some even loved it! I'm proud of you for being so open about body hair. It's crazy how hair can be so controversial, because it literally doesn't hurt anyone.... or does it....? Thank you again Ingrid for normalizing things that should already be normal!
to be honest i've really never shaved any hair on my body - except for 3 months ago i had to shaved my armpits hair for the first time ever (i'm 22) bcs of some reasons (but i won't bother shaving if it wasn't for that reason), and now it grows back and i won't bother shaving it again soon haha. i've been keeping it a secret though bcs yes, i feel embarrassed at times. i don't know that it is part of body positivity thing when i've literally been having this mindset all my life. i don't shave NOT bcs i'm too lazy to do so or that i don't take care of my body but i feel like it's a part of our body and must serves some purposes there for the benefit. and yes, i've been called out bcs i have hairy legs by boys but once again, i'm just too blessed to not care about those things as i feel like what my parents has told me about loving every part of your body is way stronger and has become my shield. so, love yourself and your body by listening to them and do what makes you comfortable in your own skin.
I shave my pubes 1nce a wk. Like if you do the same! I dont have much hair and it grows straight so ingrown isnt much of an issue...just my preference
Perhaps since body hair has been consistently considered distasteful throughout history, it is just one of those things that is not aesthetically attractive, like acne or aging. Also, your interest in trimming implies that body hair fine, but only to a certain length/ density. I know you are still experimenting with this issue, so I’m not trying to nitpick, just broaden the conversation.
Naturally, I have arm, armpit, leg and pubic hair and its the darker, heavier kind. I don't shave that much because I am lazy and don't feel like going thru the itchiness of wearing certain clothes due to shaving. For my pubic hair, I started to use scissors to trim as low as possible. I don't support fully removing pubic hair, because pubic hair is there for our body's protective defense.
❤️

I really enjoyed hearing about your experience. I recently got very upset because my high school friends (men and women) were blasting this woman for her arm pit hair and I defended her and everyone was shocked. I then brought it up to my college girlfriends, who are much more liberal and accepting, and they supported me for having an opinion but still totally disagreed. I was so shocked because I didn’t realize not everyone felt the way I do, which is the “your body your choice” type of view. I think it’s totally empowering to not conform to social norms.
There are great bikini trimmers sold by the razers! They come with a guard so you can change the length of the trim. This might be TMI, but i usually trim mine over a garbage can for easy cleanup - I used to do it into the toilet but it's so hard to clean all the little hairs after!
I haven't shaved my legs in about thirteen years and i only shave my underarms when I go to the gyno...and I admit it's to avoid the judgy vibe I fear but I don't think she'd care. All my body hair is blond and very soft ... My husband used to ask me why I bothered. I said it was for him...he said that he didn't care one way or the other, so I stopped thinking he'd change his mind. He didn't. I feel very blessed I didn't marry a man who only values a woman based on others views of her beauty.
Yes!!! All of this!!! I love having armpit hair and I honestly feel weird without public hair. I'm all about looking like a grown woman. It's not gross and it's not smelly. Stop policing what women's bodies should look like and get a life!
i completely stopped shaving my body hair a few years ago, and it took me until last summer to be fully confident in wearing what i want. i understand that it may be slightly different for you being in the public eye, but for me i went out and to my surprise... no-one has said anything to me! i feel like when you're out in public, people aren't paying as close attention to you as you think, and even if they do notice, 99% of people wouldn't dare to actually say something to a stranger on the street. which is fine by me, people can think what they want, as long as they leave me alone. it's so amazing to see someone like you as an online role model talk about this topic <3
I'm torn about this. I have really coarse black body hair and as I don't sunbathe I'm kinda pale. I'm not as paranoid as I used to be, like, I no longer freak out if I missed some hairs on my legs or haven't shaved my armpits for a while even in summer. But even in the winter (also known as full on Chewbacca season rrrrrr), if my legs hair grows too long, it will kinda start hurting when it chafes against the fabric of my clothes. I usually epilate my legs(as well as arms and stomach, sigh). As for pubic hair, I like to trim, but not shave. If I could get rid of my femmestache permanently, I'd be thrilled... 
In my teens I overheard some dude around the same age going at it with his friends about refusing to go through with relations because the girl "had a huge bush", my only thought was that he'd probably have a hard time to adjust in life.
My experience is a bit different I Am hairier than the average person. I can put grown men to shame with the amount of hair I have. If I shave in the morning by the evening my stubble is coming in. I have gone months to years without shaving and it does make a difference in my body. My armpit produces more sweat when it has hair and I start to get an odor faster than when I’m shaven. I get more odor in my pubic area AND armpits when it’s hairy. It doesn’t itch when it starts to grow it starts to itch once it’s past an inch same for my legs and pubs. When I can practically braid my hair in my body my skin gets dry and itchy which is why I shave and wax. Not constantly cuz again my hair grows fast but I let my hairs do its thing for about 3 weeks before I remove. So for my body removal of hair every now and then is a must.
YES INGRID
Being a young girl with plenty of body hair has been an extremely transformative and fulfilling experience, I wear lots of dresses and tank tops that show it off as I live in a really warm climate, and once you get past knowing that other people are going to see it no matter what, it's hardly a second thought. It actually makes me laugh now when I see people, adult men in particular, giving me dirty looks. My life, my body, my happiness.
I don't shave, but feel so much social paranoia about it. It's frustrating! Why should women feel so ashamed?
men and women who dislike this, sit down. I can relate with this video so hard, like feeling you need to shave when you go to the nail salon because I have hair on my legs or even making sure I always have parts of my body waxed. This should be a persons own choice, if you want to do it, if you don't want to you should not feel any less of a beautiful human.
I never comment on videos but I have to this time. I stopped shaving back in October. I've been called disgusting by so many people and when I go to defend myself or inform them, I'm labeled as rude or mean. My husband loves my leg hair. It's super soft. However, I live in Florida and winter is already over. I'm scared and nervous about being out and about in shorts. I'm used to getting looks because I'm bald so I expect them to be more. My "loved ones" have had a hard time with it as well, but I feel like that's on them, not me. I'm beautiful with or without hair. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for openly talking about this and personal issues and for being unapologetically yourself.
I’m feeling the same way about summer as you are. I’ve been fairly confident with my body hair when it’s all covered up in the winter, but I can’t picture myself being brave enough to expose it all in the summer, especially because I just started a new office job and I don’t want my coworkers to judge me. And I hate that I care so much about what others think, but I know they would all gossip about me behind my back
Idc what people do with their body. Live your life. But my arm pit hair irritates my skin more than shaving does when i dont shave for a few days and my pubic region hair gets caught in the fabric of underwear. I assusme tmi is out the window for these comments so sorry if you feel weird but its true. I get frequent UTI's and i have to wear thinner cotton underwear which leads some some hair getting caught and hurting. My legs... meh. I go weeks without bc my hair is thin and blonde. My husband doesn't even notice if i dont. I do it bc 1. I like the way i look and 2. Bc my sensitive skin gets irritated if i dont. Bottom line... ppl should mind their own business. If you dont go to bed with that person at night why do you care so much LOL thats how i see it.
I would rather not have itchy legs, sweaty armpits, and period blood clots stuck in public hair.
Honestly, I don't care what other people choose to do. You do you, it's a personal choice. I don't see why it's so controversial. Personally I feel smoother and cleaner and less itchy when I shave but in the winter I am often lazy. It happens. What I don't like is when women get mad at men for not being into it. Like, a man is not sexist if he doesn't want to date a woman with body hair. Some men won't care, some will. It's personal preference, not sexism. So no man is saying women don't have the right to do this, of course they do. But they don't have pretend to be into it or find it attractive.
So, I get it (the frustration of feeling like you’re expected to be hairless from the nose down) but at the same time, I enjoy being hairless in some areas (legs and underarms especially). I only very occasionally do extra extra hair maintenance  like stomach hair and even sometimes trimming my arm hairs, plus facial/neck hair... then I get incredibly itchy legs from shaving in the winter so now I only shave once a week. I dont know. I’m not completely against hair removal, but my reasons for shaving aren’t because I feel dirty or pressured. Mostly I just like how I feel.
I only shave when I want to and I always feel pretty comfortable with myself when I have body hair. And I’m always really confused when people call me out for it, it’s natural!!
Ingrid thank you so much! You have been making such great content lately and this video is so awesome. I am an 18 year old and I stopped shaving when I came into high school. Although I love my body hair and I like myself better with it, I still feel judged sometimes and pressured to remove it like everyone else. Its so crazy how people seem to turn my body hair into a political statement, it's really just a personal choice! A great point you made about razors being sold in the hygiene section instead of beauty, I had never thought of that, but it says a lot. I have had a similar experience as you when talking to my friends, especially women, about shaving. People get extremely defensive, which can be surprising because I am not trying to force anyone to do as I do, but people often seem to feel attacked when I talk about how liberated I feel by not shaving. Anyway, thank you so much for making this, you always manage to challenge your own and other people's views in a great way?
Thank you for sharing your experience and perspective! I personally shave armpits and legs, but only when I know they will be visible. I used to live in a cold climate where most of the year, this was a non issue, but now living in Florida, where it’s hot all the time and I would likely wear tanks and shorts more, I find myself struggling for the first time with showing body hair. Right now I’m at an in between phase where I only shave armpits and lower legs, since my upper leg hair is lighter and not very noticeable. I’m interested to see how my journey and acceptance of others viewing my body hair progresses, but for now I am just allowing myself to do what makes me feel comfortable in my own skin. If you feel so inclined, I would love to hear a summer update on your experience with your body hair and how exposing it to the public eye is for you. It’s your choice what you decide to share (obviously) but as someone who deals with this aspect constantly, I would be very interested to hear another honest perspective!
I love this video
I like that you stressed heavily that this was a JOURNEY you went on to discover your feelings about body hair. Every girl should be able to look beneath expectations to figure out why they're shaving, and then decide from  that  point on if they want to continue shaving for just personal preference reasons. I, for example, shave mostly because I wear skinny jeans and leggings, so having it rub up against long leg hair is a horrible feeling for me! LOL I shave underarms because I think it creates a smoother,  less messy surface for deodorant application, which is important to me. (I trim the p-region for similar reasons of just overall "neatness" and less "busyness" down there if you get my drift, not because I'm in any relationship.) 

I don't judge a man or woman for how much body hair they have, but I also think it's worth noting that there are certain things we are just not attracted to. Some are not attracted to a woman with very hair armpits, or a man with an extremely hairy chest, for example. Some people don't even really like beards on men. But if a man loves his thick bushy beard and wants to keep it, that's his choice. I think it should just be a question of preference for everyone, not something that determines how lazy/smelly/weird you are.
I LOVE not shaving!! I'm not sure if its because it feels rebellious or if it because it makes me feel like a WOMAN rather than a girl <3 

probably both tho....
We are all different.. I hatee body hair. It makes me feel itchy if I dont shave and just not good. But I dont care if others don’t shave.
grose....
Believe or not, shaving underarms constantly can increase the chance of breast cancer.
For me, I dont care if you shave or not, it doesn't bother me. In the winter, I hardly (maybe 1 or 2x out of the 4-5 months) shave my legs. As for my under arms, sometimes I can let it grow out but because I don't have a sense of smell I feel/think scent gets "stuck" in the hair. Even if I shower and use deodorant, I cant trust that either, So I shave under my arms frequently.
I hate my body hair.  Don’t care what anyone thinks. Not anyone’s business and I’d be glad to tell anyone to stay out of my face
Preach it sister! I really appreciate how deeply you went into the history of body hair and shaving!


I stopped shaving about a year and a half ago and I'm not planning on going back to shaving any time soon. For me it was partly a health thing because I get really bad eczema and when I shaved, it got worse and when I didn't shave it got worse, so I wanted to see whether getting passed the stubble phase would help the irritation (spoiler alert, for me it did) but also, feeling comfortable in my own body.


The times I was tempted to shave where when I started a new job, when I went to a wedding and when I went to the beach. The thing I realised was that any time I was tempted to shave was because I was worried about what other people would think of me, not about how I felt about me, and I wanted to be comfortable in my own skin. If I ever start shaving again, I want it to be my choice, not an obligation!
I'm too lazy to shave regularly. I have a weird sensory thing where the scratching of the hair under my arms and between my calves and ankles freaks me out and irritates my skin. I'm Mexican and Lebanese so I have a lot of hair everywhere else.
That better then women who  stoped shaving her moustaches.
In my opinion, its simply not THAT big of a deal. There’s no need to shame women for not shaving.
I totally know the feeling of people getting disgusted when they see some body hair on you... I personally like shaving my whole body hair but we all, at some point, have to let the hair grow a little in order to shave it again, and I have had to see my own family's disgusted faces while my hair was trying to grow +  people question my facial hair which its just a little darker I dont even have too much😂... cant imagine how hard it could be to someone who wants to keep they body hair... It would be awesome if society at some point accept the reality of "all humans have body hair and its natural".
several gynecologists have told me that it's better to not shave. and personally I've had so many issues when trying to shave my pubic area that it is in no way worth it. for other parts, I shave my armpits when it gets uncomfortable, which is once or twice a month, and for legs I mostly just shave in the summer and I put in the minimum effort, along the lines of "what will no longer draw attention". I think people should really stop thinking about it as a necessity, develop their actual personal relation to it and do what makes them feel most comfortable. but of course, society also influences our personal relationship to our bodies, so ... good luck everyone lol
I trim everything with a mustache trimmer when I feel like it and don’t shave anything. I am Asian and don’t have much hair to begin with though.
I def don’t care whether I have body hair or not. I’ve gone 3 months with out shaving everything. The only thing I shave maybe once or twice every two weeks is my arm pits cause it physically bugs me when it’s too long. I will admit after not shaving for a few months, shaving everything is one of my favorite feelings still. Just makes me feel so confident. Idk why. But I def wouldn’t shave just cause a date or something hahaha
Thank you for this video! When you posted about body hair initially, I rolled my eyes and though “oh greaaaat....” but you actually sparked such an epiphany for
me that has caused me to go on my own body hair journey!!! I, like so many women, have been conditioned to despise this NATURAL part of our body and growth. I’m enjoying exploring growing body hair, and giving myself the time to process. And I’m also nervous about summer!!! We can do it. ❤️
🙈
Haha in the winter i dont shave either. My ex never cared about it & im single now so its no problem. Summer is when the game begins :/
I don't really shave much in the colder months. I will shave under my arms but very rarely shave my legs even though I go to hydro with the kids I support at the school. I think everyone is going to be looking at the kids not my legs, plus my leg hair isn't that dark x
I stopped shaving when I was in a relationship with a woman who didn't as well, and since then I've felt like there is no need to shave - if any partners/friends have a problem with it, then I wouldn't want to be with them anyway. And wearing tank tops and more revealing clothing was also a real challenge for me, sometimes still is. The social pressure is so hard that I do rarely shave in the summer, or when I have to go to a very fancy event and wear a sleeveless dress. I really hope that the attitude towards this is changing and also women will stop judging other women, because I think that's the most hurtful thing for me.
These people need help.
This video is what happens when you run out of real problems in your life. You call growing hair “a journey”.
Thanks for posting this video. I rarely remove my body hair, and I secretly find it completely ridiculous that people do. I'll shave my underarms if I'm going swimming or something, but that is 100% about making other people feel comfortable. My body hair doesn't bother me one little bit. In general, I care a lot about what people think, so I'd be embarrassed if someone commented about me not shaving, but just within myself, I don't care about body hair at all - on myself or other people. I think it's a normal part of being a human. You've made me feel a lot more confident about my choice. I feel now that I'm equipped to have conversations with people about it. I can stop hiding the fact that I think removing body hair is unnecessary.
I hate shaving my legs! It just feels like such a chore! I have to shave my armpit though. I’m not that brave yet. Lol!
I think our Mum's generation and older are stuck in the past. I also can't talk to the older woman in my family, I'm made to feel dirty and weird, like I'm the only one in the world who likes having body hair. Even friends my own age are freaked out. I don't shave my armpits or lower legs in the winter but I do in the summer or when they'll be on show. I wish I didn't but I don't feel confident enough not to yet. I only ever trim my public hair with nail scissors when it gets a bit long and unruly, so that it doesn't hang out of my swimwear. Thank you for being so inspirational. One day when I grow up (I'm 27) I want to be like you. X
I stopped shaving years ago because I wanted to exercise my right to choose. I don’t think it’s right for other people to tell us what do with our bodies. I also don’t think we should allow other people’s opinions to force us to do anything, especially not shaving which is costly and time consuming. I often feel uncomfortable and sometimes think my body hair is gross but I would rather have my body hair because it is natural and I don’t see a valid reason to shave.
Love It
What about facial hair?
As a feminist, I'm not sure how I feel about shaving my own body hair. Of course, I have been socialized to feel cleaner when I shave, so I've always done it. But I also grow my hair long, because many women do that, and I love wearing makeup, because it makes me feel pretty (and therefore I conform to social norms and expectations). I guess what I want to know is, how is this different from any other beauty standard or expectation? Of course, every human should be able to do what they want to their own body, but I have noticed special attention given to discussions surrounding body hair.
Last night my boyfriend and I were talking about body hair and I talked about how it made me uncomfortable for me to have it. The thing that spoke volumes for me is him saying whether or not I shaved he’s still gonna want me and he’s still gonna be attracted to me. He’s the first male I’ve met that has said that to me. Others in the past have been like yeah you don’t shave I’m not touching you. So I’d essentially feel shamed into shaving, but with my boyfriend now, I don’t have to worry about it because he doesn’t care and that makes me feel so good. I do shave occasionally I just don’t do it regularly because honestly it’s time consuming and I have sensitive skin. I get razor burn easily. When it does come down to it though it’s my body and obviously my choice but it’s nice to know that I’m with someone who’s like so what? It’s just hair.
Have you changed your mind about the Billie's razor campaign? I think that brand normalizes body hair. What an amazing step that a razor company actually has women showing that they do have body hair.
Thanks Ingrid for making this video. For me, i opted to have my underarms hair lasered off cause i sweat a lot and live in a tropical country which makes me sweat more but my legs and other areas are waxed whenever i feel like it. I wear dresses, skirts or shorts even with unwaxed/unshaved legs. Before, i always make sure to be at the salon every month to have my body hair waxed then i realized i was wasting a ton of money. Do you, ladies and gents. It’s your body. Take care of it the best way you know how.
I find that I had a similar aversion to body hair when I was younger, I shaved my arms for swimming and then it stuck for awhile. Then I gradually grew back my arm hair and nowadays, I grow my body hair out for a week or so and then shave it. I find my skin is better and less raw all the time on my legs and armpits from shaving all the time. The only hitch I think I would feel without shaving is my pubic area in bathingsuits. Mine grows pretty far down and because I was a swimmer for 10 years, I think I link that still with being unkempt. Proud of you, Ingrid! Thanks for sharing and I think this is an incredible topic to bring to light!
I stopped shaving several months ago for the same reasons and as summer is approaching I'm experiencing similar jitters. I think I can gain confidence with my underarms and leg hair, but I'm not sure what to do about pubic hair. I love wearing shorts and swimsuits, but with those items pubic hair will be on full display. Have you (or anyone else) put any thought into this? I'd love to hear other's experiences and suggestions haha
And if you are so comfortable as you say with hair on your armpits why are you always covering them? Kept me thinking....
Also, ironic that I saw the other day someone refer to mowing lawns as a mass brainwashing of every American as something we HAVE to do and take pride in, and I find it funny that it’s the same way with our “personal lawns”!
oh wow
I've never really subscribed to the social norm of shaving every part of my body hair. I've just shaved my legs whenever I felt like doing it, and most of the time I don't. My husband doesn't care one way or another if I'm shaved or not. It was defiantly something that would not be compromised on my part because I have never wanted or cared if I shaved regularly and if my partner would have a problem with that, I wouldn't be happy in the relationship. As for pubic, I rarely shave my pubic hair and I don't like doing it and the only times I have was for other people, or because someone said it was gross to have it, so I didn't keep doing it. I do trim it, however, with hair cutting scissors. The only area I semi-regular shave is under my arms, that I also don't do as often as most people but I do find that the only reason I do is that I'm worried about what other people think of it. My leg hair doesn't bother me I don't care if people see it or care what they think about it, but when it comes to my underarms I will shave it anytime I wear something that reveals it. Though I find if I shave often under my arms I start to get large cysts and become VERY irritated and I stop shaving until it goes away. On other women I do think, oh that's gross at first but I am normally quick to realign that thought and change it to thinking more positive by saying that it's their body, not mine but I do see that as even problematic and I do need to realign that thought as well because it's still not switching my negative thought on the body hair. I'm going to rethink how I view body hair on myself and other women. While leg hair has never bothered me, I defiantly have a poor view on armpit hair that needs to be realigned. Thank you for this video.
😍😍
🤮
I remove hair when I feel like doing so. And I really don't care to hide it. I go to the gym, I wear shorts or dresses or tank tops. The only place where I regularly get a Brazilian wax is my pubic area, because with the friction (underwear/jeans/etc), it gets SERIOUSLY itchy. But the rest of my body is completely fine and I actually like my body hair. It's very soft
i hate body hair  i have unwanted hair on my back it should be on my head i dont like baldness on the head i want hair there at the moment i do have unwanted hair elsewhere ii just dont have the energy to remove it personal issues..my opinion though if you like the hair  your choice right ? dosen´t matter what other people thinks about your body hair
The only comments I have ever gotten from strangers about my body hair have been positive. Mostly from women saying they wish they were brave enough or had a job where they "could do it".  People may have negative thoughts, but don't share them. I think most people don't even really notice. So do what you want! Life is too short to be a slave to other people's opinions.
I never shaved before but now I do because everyone finds it disgusting and dirty even though it's not, and anytime I go out I wear jackets, no matter how hot it is outside, I never wear skirts or dresses anymore too, the bullying got to me, lol. I'm sure if no one said anything and just kept their mouth shut I wouldn't have felt this way. Oh well.
There is nothing wrong with having body hair. I have found nothing from a scientific standpoint that says removing hair is a healthier way to live and I’m lazy so I don’t do it. I use a trimmer every month or so just because it’s easier for me to keep clean. But as far as a regular basis..,totally removing body hair is for the birds lol
And your legs?
I will never judge any women for their body hair or lack of it! You do you. That being said, I have tried (sometimes for months) to let my body hair grow because I thought it was the more "feminist" thing to do. It just isnt for me. My hair is very coarse, I find it hot and itchy and distracting. I absolutely hate the feeling of pubic hair against underwear, the longer the hair the worse it is for me. I'm a dancer, and the feeling of my leg hair poking through my tights annoys me. I dont like the way the peach fuzz on the sides of my face clings to my makeup and sweat when dancing and exercising. I also missed the act of shaving in the shower. I find it so therapeutic and relaxing to wind down at the end of the day. As long as it isn't hurting anyone, to each their own! I dont get why this is so controversial at all. I would love recommendations for less wasteful hair removal methods though! I do tweeze parts of the downstairs area, but the legs and underarms are way too big for that.
Thank you! I’ve been curious why as of recently to! Since I met my fiancé since he’s a little older mentioned rite away that he would rather me have hair. So I tried it because I never let it grow at all before. Once I had our son I gave up on shaving my legs because as a mom I have way les time and now I’m really curious about having armpit hair lol it’s been 4-5 days no shaving. I really just like the idea of just waking up and going like men do. I spend every moment between baby fussing so if I find time to myself I don’t want to be doing hair chores. Please let me know how it goes with darker hair!
I don’t shave regularly. I hate shaving. I only shave a few times a year.
I’m not gonna and act like I’m for it, I simply find it nasty myself.. but you do you.. :)
I feel like I am in a great place where I only remove body hair when I want to for me. I tend to keep my underarms fairly smooth because I find hair there to be a little bit itchy, and I like the way my deodorant rolls on with clean shaved arms. my legs I basically shave totally sporadically. I don't like my leg hair to get too long cause it sort of tickles, so usually like once a month, I'll shave it off. When it comes to public hair I just trim a little cause I get AWFUL ingrown hairs down there, and just find shaving and the regrowing process to be such an awful pain. When I first started dating my husband, he asked me to shave down there and I tried it a couple times before being like, NO WAY. He was very chill about it and now says it doesn't matter to him at all.
I shave my legs below my knees more in the winter than the summer.  I love my wool tights but learned the hard way that leg hair will get caught in the fibers and then it rips out at the worst moment usually painfully.  So my options were to shave or give up my woolens (if I didnt want to continue the surprise tights waxing).  I could never give up my woolens in the winter but I just dont bother in the summer most of the time.  My underarms do get very itchy and uncomfortable and it only gets worse the longer I go so that I do once a week but it takes next to no time cause I'm not worried about how it looks just how it feels.
Yes!!!! I love this video so much, I have been following your journey and really enjoying it!  I haven't shaved my legs in probably 4 months, and I am really toying with the idea of not shaving at all this summer, because why??  Also, as far as trimming goes, I think that it goes along with maintenance, which is a different side of caring for your body.  I trim my pubic hair, mostly because it's annoying during my period when it's really long, especially because I use pads.  So I don't think there's any shame in "trimming" because it is you choosing what you want your hair to be like, just like the hair on your head.
When my armpit hair gets long, it starts to curl, so I just take scissors and trim it a little. I don’t shave cause I like the hair!
I am completely aware of the fact that I wax (I think it's a cultural thing, in my country the normal thing is waxing not shaving) because the societal beauty standard is for women to not have body hair. I'm pretty much aware of the fact that most, if not all, my beauty ideals are defined by society. Maybe if I lived in the classic greek era I would appreciate my little body fat or my strong nose, but sadly I live in a time that doesn't value that. I think what bothers people is accepting this, accepting the fact that they like trends because they are made to subconsciously like them. I personally don't care for body hair, but I do feel prettier when I don't have it. I am lucky to have the resources to have had most of my hair lasered off and the rest I wax. It's fine, it doesn't really bother me that much, but I'm not about to pretend that I chose to like this, it is clearly determined by the society that surrounds me.
Every time i consider not shaving for a while, i get to that itchy phase and just absolutely cannot stand it, so i end up shaving.
Really interesting topic. I definitely think, the society pushes women to shave cause it's seen as normal, cause we have to be feminine, soft... And it's boring. Even my boyfriend kind of pushed me to shave
I’m so glad this come up in my recommenced so I could unsubscribe to her <3
Honestly, everyone should do whatever they want with their body. I hate body hair. But it's just me, I don't pretend everybody have to do the same as me just because I don't like it. Surely not shaving could be as clean as doing it... So, nobody have to explain anything to anybody, just do whatever they  like.
Girl.
I shave because if I don't I feel gross
QUEEN!
Because... cultural norms.
Don’t know why i feel like crying after watching this video. We are approaching year 2020 and yet, we - women still need to justify our feelings of having our own hair to be shown in the public. Sigh ... nevertheless we need someone like you to start campaigning :) all the best Ingrid !!!
armpit hair needs to be shaved, tbh. for both men and women. it makes everyone smell worse. everything else doesnt matter
Hey!  I decided to stop shaving a few years ago.  I never liked to, and my skin doesn't really like it.  I trim my hair with clippers, like the kind the hair dresser uses for buzz cuts and the like--sometimes i'll even use one of the guards (but i've deff used scissors before too, haha!).  Honestly i think i feel more shame/apprehension about my leg hair than i do my armpits?  idk why.  I don't have visible hair on my thighs--i never shaved them, so the hair remained super blonde and fine, but my lower leg, and armpit, hair is another story.  it's dark and gets pretty long, and isn't cute and scraggly like you see on women's empowerment illustrations.  And it almost grows in stages?  like there's some hairs that grow in fast and dark, and then some hairs that don't show up for like 6 weeks and aren't as thick or dark.  What's up with that??  I tend to not like it as much once all the hair is grown in and dark.  I haven't figured out why yet, but probably societal.  So i do shave my legs once or twice a year to maintain their cute scraggly soft hair, instead of thick soft hair, haha.  I also haven't figured out how i'll feel in an intimate setting.  I think it would have to be a conversation i had with a partner, about how we both choose to groom our hair and if there's anything the other would prefer and why.   Anyway, thank you so much for talking about this and being open about your feelings, even though it's stupid that you should have to.  gosh, sorry this comment is like 5 comments in one 😅
I think the porn industry is also responsible somewhat for pubic hair trends. In the 70s no one shaved Down there.. and now.. the girls are completely bare and bleached lol
Shaving and waxing makes us feel good about our selves that’s why majority of females do that. ( we are not doing it to please or satisfy anyone, we are not doing it to fit into standards or society) . It simply Makes us feel more beautiful, confident and clean ( there is nothing wrong with that) .
People always say it smells more if you have hair. That's completely false. The body is naturally efficient. The hair is there for a reason so you using a razor to shave is not going to make you more clean. People need to stop making their preferences seem like anything more than just that. Preferences. Not better, not worse, not cleaner.
I’m not very hairy naturally, I haven’t shaved my legs in years no one notices and my friends that know only do because I told them. lol I don’t think it is gross but it’s culture I guess.
Interesting video. A friend of mine dated a French man for a while and he mentioned that he thought it was strange how some American women shaved their pubic hair. He was actually turned off by no pubic hair because adults are supposed to have pubic hair. Hair-less private parts are normal on children so why would some adults want their private parts to resemble those of young pre-pubescent children? I always thought that was funny and thought provoking.
Frankly I noticed I really do remove my body hair due to social pressure. I feel if I don’t remove my visible body hair others will not view me as feminine or beautiful. Especially when I have a significant other in my life I always place more pressure on keeping myself bare. Mostly because I know the other person might find it gross. It’s tiring to keep up with hair removal to be honest, and I wish I had the guts to just let it be.
I found that when I would shave my armpits I would smell worse than when I had armpit hair because the deodorant would sweat off very easily whereas having the hair helps hold on to the deodorant much longer, but I personally don't keep it trimmed. I live in Michigan, so I let my leg hairs grow out in the winter time and keep in shaved in the summer time. As far as pubic hair goes, I only shave for special occasions because of the itchiness when it grows back, but otherwise I just keep it trimmed with scissors.
It’s recommended in some religions to remove hair from areas that are not always exposed to air as  apart of personal hygiene and to prevent moist and bacterial and fungal growing !! I think removing underarm and pubic hair is healthy ! Idont care about social opinions ,, thats what i believe
Pubic hair is the only body hair that I can remotely keep. It also has to be trimmed. Armpit hair and leg hair removal is definitely preferable in my case. However, I applaud women who can keep leg and armpit hair.
I don’t hate body hair I don’t think it’s dirty, it’s just uncomfortable with some clothes for me. my partner don’t mind when I go weeks without shaving.
I haven’t waxed my armpits in like 3 months and honestly is so liberating, no one sees my armpits and I don’t really care to see it so I feel really free and weirdly I don’t sweat as much as I did or maybe I just don’t feel it, I don’t know if I’m going to wax them in the summer but right now I actually feel empowered
I went through chemotherapy last year and because of that, my skin became VERY sensitive.  I had to stop any type of hair removal because my skin would react horribly.  It's been over a year now, and I still haven't removed any hair.  I'm sure my skin is fine now, but...well...I just don't care anymore.  It's just not important to me to have hairless skin :) It's sad that we have such strong feelings about body hair on women (and now on men.)  Back in the '70's hairy men were sexy...now hair on men doesn't seem to be as popular.  Anyway...I'm glad I stopped shaving.
I've pretty much gone through the same journey in the past year. I have grown to love my body hair. I have not shave in over 9 months now but I did invest in a body trimmer which I use on my pubic, armpit and leg  hair when it gets too long and uneven. For me what help me to embrace my body hair is to keep it uniform. The same way I prefer the hair on my head to be even and trim, I like the same for body hair. Here are some great body hair trimmers you can try, I like them both but I prefer the one advertise for men: Philips Norelco Bodygroomer BG5025/49 - skin friendly, showerproof, back and body hair shaver and trimmer 
Philips SatinShave Advanced Women’s Electric Shaver, Cordless Wet and Dry Use, 4 Accessories (BRL140) 
Hi Ingrid thank you for sharing your experience:) I shave almost everyday and I hate it bc I feel like hair is natural and should be embraced :) I think it’s awesome  when people don’t shave. I don’t judge no one for having hair like I said it’s natural to each their own. I personally want to get laser but I feel like I’d only do it to follow a social norm
I have hair all over my body. I stopped shaving my legs a couple of years ago because I became lazy and never started again . After I stopped I used to always think are people going to judge me and think eww that looks gross? I still think that at times even after so much time has passed and I wish I could stop and just fully accept my hairy legs. I still wear shorts out in public though because I think it would be ridiculous to restrict my myself to only long pants just because I have hairy legs. I live in South Florida, so summer and long pants are not a good combo.  I think the main reasons why I used to worry what others thought about my body hair and still do sometimes is because being hairless is seen by society as something that a woman should do to look good, and because people online can be very judgmental when others talk about how they don't shave, or post pictures on social media of their hairy legs, armpits, etc. What if removing body hair had never been a thing at any point in time is still wasn't? Then no one would care about women being hairy because it would just be considered normal by society instead of something that's gross. People would just think "Hey, women are humans and humans have body hair, it's natural". I have also stopped shaving my pits for a while in the past, but have now started again for personal reasons (but for me, not anyone else). I sometimes trim "down there" a little bit if I feel like it (again, for me), and I do shave the hair on my upper lip, but that's it. I've also never done anything with my eyebrows either. Luckily I've never heard anyone say anything to me about my hairy legs. Maybe they genuinely didn't care, or they were just keeping quite, who knows. Anyway, if you prefer to shave, cool, if not, that's ok too. Do it for yourself though, not for others :).
No. Just no.
Thank you for this video Ingrid! It takes so much courage to post a video like this on the web as unfortunately topics such as this that draw attention to the stigma associated with gender norms, can very easily be targets of toxic call-outs. Furthermore, I have to say I really admire your decision to grow out your body hair, even if it's temporary. As I was watching this video, I reflected on my own struggles with body hair. Growing up, I recall being teased by classmates about my body hair. Unfortunately, my vulnerable adolescent self wasn't strong enough to ignore these hate comments, I immediately summited to society's expectations of women and began to either hide my body hair or experiment in hair removal. I think body hair has become such a taboo in our society that despite acknowledging how ridiculous it is for women to view their own body hair with such negative connotations, we can't help but continue to remove our hair in fear of judgment from others. However, I think videos like this are crucial because it makes us more aware of how common issues like this are. I commend you for that. 
Recently, I read two articles which shed light on the importance of addressing the stigma around body hair. I found them very insightful and inspiring. I think you might too. 
  
 


Sending love from Canada!
Dont cut your hair
That's cool.
I haven't shaved my leg hair in so long bc I hate doing it, I hate the feeling of it growing back, and mine grows back so quickly it doesn't feel worth it. However, I still feel like it is so ugly, and as such I am really conflicted about whether I want to shave it for events this summer (like a holiday, or my uni formal) like I did last summer. this vid helped me decide once and for all that I'm going to do what I want to do in the moment! Thanks ingrid :)
Yup I shave every day and so glad I do. What is the point of letting hair grow? It’s not feminine, it looks horrible there is nothing appealing about body hair. Just because something is “natural” doesn’t mean it’s the most appropriate thing to do.
I have a very strong dislike towards body hair on women. This much, that it even turns my stomach just looking at it. I know I am brain washed by media and I would never tell a women to remove her body hair just to please me. I actually think it is pretty cool that they do their own thing regardless of societal standards. My internal reaction is my problem and not theirs. I do not like how I feel and tried many times to change this but was never successful. Maybe as a lesbian it is easier to fight this stereotype of a hairless female. I hope the next generation of women, won't be as brainwashed as I am.
So I still shave my armpits and legs, but I have completely stopped shaving my pubic hair. I will never shave it again. I still wanted a kind of “put together” and “cleaner” feeling, for lack of a better word, so I opted for trimming! I literally went down to Walmart and bought a men’s electric hair trimmer and I use the smallest clip. Works like a charm and it’s so much easier and more comfortable than shaving!
I find this topic super interesting because it's so strangely controversial. I don't shave, I never have and likely never will. I do trim some things but I started to do that because it's what I wanted and I knew it would make me more comfortable. But what's funny to me is I remember people around me making fun of other girls not shaving their legs and whenever I said something about the fact that I don't shave either their excuse was always "Oh well, you're blonde and so is your leg hair so it doesn't matter." Which stuck with me for a moment, it's how I justified it for a little while. And then I realized how absolutely idiotic that is and I wish I would've told those people off. It's hair, not some weird fungus that's going to eat you alive if it looks at you. My view on body hair is this - I don't care what you wanna do with it, just don't be a jerk to others if they don't do the exact same as you.
My beautician and mom and teacher think im weird for saying i dont want to permanently remove my leg and armpit hair. (I personally dislike facial and pubic hair so i do remove those) i just feel that i want to be able to go back to it. Change my body however i want. I like seeing hair on me sometimes and when i dont i can always shave it. No one gets a say on it but me. And i think women should be free to decide too. I know girls who hate waxing but do it anyway because society pressures us to. That has to change
I epilate. I hate shaving and would prefer being hairy than shaving. Having said that, I much prefer epilating than having hair on my legs and underarms (I trim my bikini - no brazilian for me - was never keen on having my nether regions look close to a child's). I'm very aware that this is completely due to society and its beauty standards but I love having hairless underarms and legs. It makes me feel really good so I don't think I could go back to being hairy all the time. If it was more acceptable to be hairy, I might let my hair grow a bit longer but I think I would still epilate on a regular basis.
I stopped shaving my armpits because they were constantly irritated due to shaving, and I’ve actually found that not shaving is more hygienic for me. My skin doesn’t get irritated and I don’t get ingrown hairs. Having hair also helps prevent chaffing because it prevents your bare skin from rubbing directly on other areas of skin. I would never go back to shaving, having hair is sooooo much more comfortable.
I shave occasionally when im wearing shorts or dresses out, but 90% of the time i just dont want to spend the time doing it, and my legs in particular get extremely sensitive and irritated if i shave too regularly. I can honestly say it makes 0 difference in my cleanliness or smell bc i shower daily, use deodorant, lotions, and perfume. I've never understood people who think that not shaving makes a woman dirty because all the men in my life who dont shave are clean (seeing as they also shower and look after themselves) Body hair is such a polarizing topic, i'd never spent much time thinking about it but from the comments on this video just.. wow, a lot to wonder about because the misconceptions are crazy
You stopped shaving for the same reason some men start full body shaving. Because you're probably not Heterosexual. Lesbians don't usually mind a hairy women. Gay men don't usually mind and delicate, soft to the touch man. Straight men are not usually into hairy women, and straight women are not usually into delicate, soft to the touch, men. LGB folks are into different things than Hetero folks. In the end, people should be allowed to be themselves, and be attracted to who and what they're attracted to. For someone to shame men for desiring a hairless, smooth to the touch woman is just as nonsensical and someone shaming people who desire hairy, rough women. Everyone should be allows to like what they like. Not just gays and lesbians. It's okay for hetero men to be into smooth women. It's dishonest and cowardice to claim that men's natural sexual desires in women is somehow flawed or negative somehow.

I’ve never shave my leg hair become I didn’t learn to and my mom didn’t tell me I had to and the hair on my leg is barely noticeable. I only remove my armpit hair I use a hair remover cream instead of shaving though I only do it because I feel uncomfortable especially thinking that people would say something if they see I have hair there.
In the 90’s when Where Have All The Cowboys Gone first made it’s way to my rural South Carolina town all the cheerleaders and popular kids were playing it. Then the album came out with Paula Cole on a swing. Her nakedness wasn’t the topic of conversations........It was her armpit hair! The same kids that liked her before now didn’t because it was “gross”. The internet was still new here, was until 1999, so few knew what she looked like before then. I’m sure Ask Jeeves had countless searches for her. 😂
While men get to show off with their body hair from head to toe especially during the summer when they just go and put on their shorts. They don't even have to bother to think if their legs are shaved or not. Why can't we have the same luxury!!?? Why are we not allowed to wear our body hair the same way? Why do you have to be nervous about summer and short dresses? Honestly, body hair pisses me off!!
😳😬
I have no issues with body hair if anything I shave because I don't like the feeling of it and when I have been really lazy (which happens at max every few months resulting in not shaving for at least a month) I get super itchy at least in public region and I will itch so much that I cause myself to bleed so. Only reasons I personally haven't and probably won't stop shaving
seriously EWW. stop with this crap
Lastly, Ingrid is completely dishonest about her claim that she isn't telling anyone that they are doing something bad, and therefore their negative response to her speaking on this is absurd. Only she does by bashing "the male gaze", and discussing it as if only men, specifically heterosexual men, have "the gaze", and then insinuates that it's always negative. It's not negative to find some attractive.
Body hair + sweat = stinky odour. Sure you can use deodorant and wash but you can’t do that in the middle of day while walking around town in 35c+ degree weather. Everyone can do whatever they like, I personally find it gross. I also feel much more comfortable in the summer when I shave my pubic hair. Again, hair plus sweat equals stinky odour.
I shave usually everyday or every other day. I had been made fun of when I was 7 because I have really dark hair naturally since I’m Hispanic. I started shaving when I was 8 because I wore jeans even in the summer because I hated it and my parents finally let me. I still shave very often to this day. I just feel better when I do. For intimacy I like it and I just don’t like the feel of hair on me. Don’t come at me I just find it odd when women don’t but I think it’s just cause I’ve never seen women not shave or if I have I thought it was  gross. But I think everyone has their right to choose what they do to their own bodies and listening to your views kinda makes me see it in a different perspective. I don’t think it’s gross now just still odd to me 🤷🏻‍♀️
If you hate shaving and don’t care how you look with having body hair grown out, then don’t shave! As for me I like everything smooth and it makes me feel more clean (even though it’s not). Just because you shave doesn’t mean it has to do with prejudice or sexism. Whatever makes you happy!
The message of shaving is: women, in their natural form, are gross. Also, "let's oppress women and instill in their mind that they are naturally disgusting, let's make them waste their time with these petty things, this way they will bettoo distracted by "beauty standards" instead of raising their head and see the conditions in which they're living" ;)
I used to only shave my legs when I chose to. I shaved my armpits for my deodorant to apply nicer... But now I HAVE to shave my face because of hirsutism. It is extremely unfeminine, so to feel feminine again I shave all the time.
Shave for yourself girl. It doesn’t need to be for anyone else. Do things for you. For you.
i only shave when i have pe at school because i have to wear shorts and i’m scared that people would make fun of me because my hair is very dark
I get rid of hair whenever I want there are times when I do and times where I don’t for a long period of time. I don’t hate body hair I’m totally fine with it and currently I’m growing out my armpit hair. If you want to you can it’s your body it’s totally up to you and your choice
I feel like body hair should never make you feel anxious - during winter when I'm covered up, I let nature do its thing snd shave only when it takes my fancy - but in the summer having hairy legs or armpits would make me not feel my best so I shave regularly out of free will. I don't see the point in forcing yourself to keep the hair in the summer just to make a feminist point. To me, hairy legs in shorts just looks ugly and unkempt.
I completely understand where you are coming from. I don’t specifically mind if women leave their body hairs. For myself, I don’t like the combination of short dresses/shorts and hairy legs. It’s just a visual discrepancy that bugs me. I’m aware that it is something trained on by society in the sense of: it’s not feminine to wear short dresses and have hairy legs. Still, I’ll go on shaving my legs...pubic hair is a bit different in my opinion. It’s not on show publicly. I can deal with some pubic hair, as long as I can trim it.
It's been a long time since I disliked a video. Yuck. Bless your heart. Thanks
OHH but I wanted to let you know my views on the opposite!! When I was younger, I only thought I needed to shave my UNDERARM! THAT IS IT. And when I found out people shaved their AMRS. IM LIKE WHAHHHHHHAHHAHA The feezy. LOL I thought it was STRANGE> GROSS that PPL shaved their arm! Isn't that crazy! That was when I was younger, LATER I found out SO MANY PPL SHAVED THEIR ARMS! And I was like OH i guess its a thing people do? So then it was not as gross, and kinda just grew up lol. TO STOP THINKING THINGS ARE GROSS! Anyhow. As for my legs, i think its different, since my leg hairs are so.. hmmmm clear! like very light, its kinda hard to see unless you look close so I didn't really have a problem when I wore shorts etc in public, but then I don't know if I would feel different if I had DARKER hair that stands out. Also, I still shave for weddings or what not cuz I like the smooth look :) lol
I do and do not let my body hair grow.  Facial and pubic is only when I want to cause I dont give a shit about it. My armpits I rarely shave but I also dont wear sleeveless tops unless I'm at home or wearing like a cardigan. That isn't due to the hair but something else. My legs on the other hand, I go from waxing to shaving to letting it grow it's a fucking rollercoaster of emotions with my leg hair. I dont care if it grows but then I do and don't want other people to see it. It's a battle that intensifies in the summer. When I see other women with it it's an internal battle of you go girl and that kinda looks gross.i have to talk to myself and berate myself about it. Body hair acceptance is a constant up and down for me.
I only shave my legs in summer because I want to look cute in shorts. BTW, female razors suck. I hate how they make female items more "delicate" and expensive than males items. I use a man's razor because they actually work for my thick hair.
Like most American boys by the time I was 11 years old or so I'd had it drilled into my head that ALL girls were "supposed to shave to be attractive and acceptable". What many girls don't realize is: Just like they get it put into their minds that they are supposed to shave, us guys get the same brainwashing as well and yes it IS brainwashing going under the more politically correct and acceptable term of "social conditioning" which I totally refuse to recognize. For me though that all changed the summer I was 13. Some buddies and I were down at a river beach and an older girl perhaps 18-20 years old came on the beach and put her towel down about 30 feet away. She took off her tee shirt revealing a bikini top and 2 incredibly thick dark hairy armpits. It was the first time I had ever seen a female with underarm hair and while my buddies were either laughing or getting grossed out, I was standing there experiencing the biggest, quickest and most powerful sexual arousal I had ever had to that point in my life. Sorry if this is a bit explicit but there's no other way of honestly telling it. To this day I don't know why or how...and I have never cared.. but something just clicked open in my brain and has stayed open to this day. From that point on I KNEW that I would forever be committed to dating girls who kept their body hair natural and have definitely done so. I just think it looks more natural, certainly more mature, and yes attractive and sexy and it also gives a girl a certain uniqueness. I think it makes a girl look so much more like an adult instead of a child which in my view is what shaving does. During my teens and up to my mid 20's or so, female body hair was strictly a powerful sexual turn on for me and still is but as I got older I started appreciating much more the social non-sexual aspect of it. Just the courage, confidence and intelligence it took and still takes for a female to make that decision whatever her personal reasons for doing so are. To not shave body hair and then go out in public wearing a halter top and shorts is for me an awesome display of non conformity which I will always admire and appreciate and totally support. This is a great video and I certainly hope you stick to your beliefs. In the last few years many females of all ages and backgrounds are ceasing this useless and unhealthy body "standard" and it is not a moment to soon. I really hope and believe that someday soon it will be the "norm" rather than the exception. And for those of you who think and/or say I am "objectifying" or "fetishizing"....grow up get real and educate yourself. We all have our trigger points and if they are used in a mature, respectful and healthy way, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that....Period
Love your honesty in this video, Ingrid. I shave my body hair because I feel unfeminine if I don't, which I hate because I know it is only because of society. I think it is awesome when women stop shaving. This conversation reminds me of a moment when I was in fifth grade. I was not allowed to shave yet and one day I was wearing cropped pants and my leg hair was exposed. This boy sitting next to me noticed and asked if I'd "ever heard of a razor before." It was really embarrassing, but there was another boy on the other side of me who stuck up for me. Kudos to him. I don't like to wear shorts without shaving my legs because I'm afraid people are going to think it is disgusting since I have dark leg hair. I commend you for taking this journey.
It’s pretty normal to not shave our legs where I live so i never had a problem with that and I’ve never shaved my legs. It’s completely fine whether we choose to shave or not to shave I’ve never received any judgemental looks
I have gone months without shaving my legs and I’m not embarrassed to wear a dress. My boyfriend doesn’t care and I just care really what other people (aka women) think. It has taught me to love my natural beauty and I feel more comfortable in my own skin. 

I’m Hispanic and older generations don’t really shave their legs where I’m from. So my mom never shaved her legs and was weird to me that it was considered “gross” to not shave their legs when I was in middle school.
Why don't u shave for the summer! !!!
I don't care who you are or what you say....this is gross...women can empower themselves in other ways. I am sorry...I buy into the whole "Women should shave" thing. My boyfriend would die if I told him I was just never shaving again. I shave when I want. Sometimes that is every three days sometimes it is once every 2 weeks. It just depends.
My only problem with body hair is armpit hair. Women, men, it grosses me out. Maybe that’s something I need to get over, but there’s something about seeing tiny hairs poking out like spider legs from someone’s armpits that is just gross to me.
Quoting gender studies. Wow. Men shave too. It’s not such a big deal.
I do it only when i have to swim and summer
I don’t care if people have body hair or not, but it pisses me off most when other women or men talk down to women who decide to not completely remove their pubic hair. There’s such a societal standard that you need to be completely bare now, and that’s just not the case for everyone 🤷🏽‍♀️ especially cuz men out here want women sucking their dicks all directions, with their hair. Yet when’s it’s women, the duty can’t be done unless she’s bare. Like okay then, go suck your own dick babe 💀
I rarely shave my legs in winter but I like the feeling now and then when it’s smooth and soft. I agree with you. It’s not itchy on my legs at all. With armpits for me it’s a little different. I do adjust my outfit to my armpit hair. I shave it when I know I’ll wear tank tops or something similar. And I’ll wear something long when I know I haven’t shaved it. Don’t really feel bad or smelly or dirty about it tbh. I guess it’s just society screaming inside my head that that’s the way to be socially accepted. Sometimes it does itch but not that often. That’s the only two body parts I shave. I’ve never touched my arms with anything when it comes to shaving even though they’re pretty long. They’re blond though and I don’t feel uncomfortable. Also, i don’t want to feel the need to shave them regularly because once I start shaving the hair it will slightly change its structure and feeling. Pubic hair is a whole different story for me. I used start with just trimming with scissors then I tried hair removal lotion (total fail)  and then shaving. That escalated quickly with acne and let me tell you THAT WAS ITCHY. So I finally went to waxing and I’m doing that now regularly. The main reason I do it on a routine is so the hair keeps getting thinner and im regularly confronted with the pain. I notice that if I skip a month or two I get very anxious because waxing isn’t fun 😂😂 I don’t ever shave it in between though, because that would mean the hair would grow back thicker which equals more pain. When I do skip a month, i just trim it and I’m okay with it but I do have to say that it itches now and then when it reaches a certain length. Also when the stubbles are growing out of the skin in the beginning it’s a war zone of pimples, ingrown hair and redness (though only 1/3 as bad as when I shaved). Really want to try out laser hair removal because my pubic hair actually bothers me. Not bc of my bf or bc it’s dirty or unhygienic or whatever, simply because I find it very uncomfortably itchy and it gives a feeling of uneasiness. Any experience with laser hair removal down there, anyone?
So many people in the comments are saying how they don't care anymore and shave whenever they want to. I WISH. If i were to wear shorts everyday then I need to shave my legs everyday (the calves only, I wax thighs) but I have STAWBERRY LEGS and it's dotty and I think it's gross ugh, I want to just wax my calves which I have before but I can only wax once a month so during a lot of that time my hair would have grown, so I'm stuck to shaving
Very interesting discussion! Personally I got my pubic hair lasered a few years ago because that’s how I like it, I also did a few laser sessions on my underarms so I only have a bit of growth so I don’t really shave that. I also stopped shaving my legs like 4 years ago because I didn’t enjoy it and I don’t really care. Every woman should be entitled to do whatever they want with their bodies regardless of society and other people’s opinions
Truly, lastly, this video is another addition to the pattern of specific groups of people who have their own specific beliefs, wrongly and in a nonsensical way, enforcing their values on other group. Lesbians and Bisexual women are attracted to different things that Heterosexual men are in women. Just because you like body hair on women, doesn't mean Hetero men are suppose to be like you and like it too. That's dumb. Like what you like, but stop that nonsensical enforcement of whats normal for you, on others.
I’m sorry but as a woman, I feel gross with body hair... I feel manly.. I want to feel soft, smooth, pamperd. I’m not doing it because society told me too... I’m doing it for ME.. when I feel stuble on my legs.. it’s gross... not to say that you hav to shave.. it a preference. But if anything do it for you, not because society says you can or can’t.
I don't shave when I feel like it, I shave as soon as the hair starts going cray cray and it's because I'm a sweaty person who sweats even more with hair, which isn't anything to do with gender and everything to do with biology. What I don't understand is why it's so 'bad' for women to be viewed as these hairless, porcelain dolls while men are viewed as hairy and ruggedly handsome. I actually like that stereotype that society enforces because men are more attracted to my softness and I'm attracted to their ruggedness. Sure, if those aren't your sexual preferences then you do you but just because I shave doesn't mean I'm being oppressed by misogynistic societal norms as feminists like to say, while also claiming to support women's right to choose lol
I shave my legs maybe once a  month (or longer) but do my armpits more regularly. Sometimes, a week or so will have gone past and I wont realise that my armpit hair has grown back. It really doesn't bother me. I actually love having leg hair and embracing it. I do have blonde hair, so my leg hairs are considerably less prominent. I've asked my boyfriend before what he thinks of it (not that it would change my position) but he said he honestly doesn't think about it or even consider it. He would never decide to not be sexually involved with me because I have body hair nor does he think it's gross. I just have long leg hair most of the time, and he accepts that thats how it is. It's really a freeing thing allowing yourself to make decisions about your body hair and period based on your perceptions of self, rathe than perceptions of society.
I remember first realizing that women didn’t have to shave when I started to get into Amanda Palmer of the Dresden Dolls. Her outlook was always, ‘I shave if I feel like it, and typically I don’t feel like it.’ A few years back I was reading the Outlander novels and the main character decides to shave her armpits or something and her husband is like ‘what??? Why did you do that? That’s so weird.’ I would always apologize to whatever dude I was dating when my legs weren’t super smooth and they’d always be like ‘what? Oh whatever I don’t care.’ And now that I’m in love with a woman, I get it. Neither of us enjoy shaved pubes, thankfully, and legs and armpits we shave when we feel like it, which is sometimes. It feels really freeing and natural to make our own decisions about it, and it’s astounding how little either of us actually care one way or the other.
I love how people make not shaving their armpits such a big deal. Like it’s so “life changing” and “eye opening”. It’s just hair, if you wanna have stinky armpits, by all means! Nobody cares.
I hope this starts a revolution! If it was more acceptable in our culture to have hair I would be ELATED to lay off shaving anything. It’s sad to do something so often because of what other people think rather than what I care about. Shaving happens because if I don’t, I become self conscious. People will think I’m gross for having long leg hair, armpit hair, etc. but do I like doing it so often? No. Love this video. You’re the true queen.
Wow I never realized what a polarizing topic body hair was! Honestly I am naturally blonde so my body hair is very light to begin with but I've never put much importance on shaving. I do it when I feel like it, when a razor happens to be handy and I have the time I guess haha. I rock armpit hair and tank tops and bikinis all summer, I get pedicures with really hairy legs. I just haven't ever cared and only had a vague passing thought that other people might care. Which is kind of weird because I'm not exactly someone who is overly confident and doesn't care what people think. Actually my ex used to say my legs were softer when I didn't shave lol. However, when it comes to the bikini area I do wax or use a trimmer because it gets very uncomfortable and gets pulled when I cross my legs, etc. I also don't like that period blood gets in it when I use pads. So I guess I'm all over the place lol.
I found this video on YouTube of a lady explaining why she stopped shaving and that encouraged me to stop doing it a few months ago. The scary thing for me is that I wear tank top to fitness classes and so I still shave my armpits because the hair is dark. I don’t shave my legs, even when wearing capri legging to exercise classes and no one has noticed (probably because it is blond compared to my armpit hair). I am just afraid of summer like you are Ingrid. I never in my life shaved my pubic hair because I never learned it was a thing and so I thought the hair was normal. I agree that women should do what they want to THEIR body and not listen to what others think. Maybe one day I will stop shaving my armpits, but I am still nervous. I am lazy to shave so there is an excuse and also I am starting to like body hair more than before.
I think people (at least in the Midwest) equate body hair with men, and men just naturally sweat or smell not so great more than women do, so to some people that means hair equals smelly. I personally just do whatever I feel like. I don’t shave my legs hardly at all, and pubic and armpit hair is just whatever I feel like doing. I’m not sure if this is truly my feminist ideology, or if I just got lucky with genes that made me blonde with really fine body hair. Part of me thinks I’d have a very different experience if I had very dark or course hair. My boyfriend used to be really freaked out by body hair on women, but now that I’ve been just doing me with my body hair, he’s gotten so much more open and actually likes it on me because he can tell that I’m more comfortable when I don’t shave all the time. I make my body hair choices for me, but it’s still great to have support from loved ones. It’s just funny that I get more support for having body hair from my boyfriend than my female friends.
Im just not shaving my legs since the hair has grown really long and thick and it would be quite a challenge to do it. But the thing is im just ok with this hair, i even like it, i find it cute. Sadly for most people it's disgusting. I wonder why? Why  be disgusted by your own body? It's a natural thing, it's your hair, it grows where it should grow. I just don't get it.
I forget to shave and honestly am just too lazy sometimes. I work in a business environment where I am dressed in skirts almost daily and my unshaven legs are exposed to the world! I get a little uncomfortable when I think about it, but also it's my body so who cares! Nobody has ever pointed it out except for me.. I do, however, feel sexiest when I am clean shaven. It reminds me of that Sex and the City episode where the girls get brazilian waxes for the first time and express that they feel like 'walking sex'
Sick 🤮🤣
Im a natural blonde and i have blonde hair on my legs. Never shaved them and u cant even see them. Only under the sun they start darkening a little bit. But if i shave them they gonna be darker. So im never gonna do that. Im 22 :)
I feel like the more we talk about it the bigger deal it becomes. Everyone should just do what they want and accept each other for however they choose to be.
I’m 17 and I really don’t like shaving, but I can’t bring myself to stop bc I know everyone close to me is very close minded when it comes to shaving (especially my parents and grandparents) but also I end up feeling bad when I shave bc I know I’m just complying to the norm. Ughh it’s so stressful
Real women don’t shave
I haven’t shaved in over almost a year... only because I’m trying to go plastic free. As my hair grew I became more fond of my hair. Although today I noticed that I still feel ashamed about my hair on my legs. I do trim my pubic and armpits. I feel empowered that more women are letting themselves be free. I am nervous about my legs during the summer :/
what about plucking your eyebrows?
Im ok with both.  I hate to shave but i do like once a month or when i feel like to.  I do shave my pubic hair because that area is very humid and often have discharge ( not yeast infection or bacteria.. just my body always produce discharge) so i feel can get more messy and smelly if i dont trim down or shave but i dont fo it daily.. my legs... i only do it if i have to.. but i don't know why some girls ir guys feel like girls have to shave to be girly...
I have high testosterone so, I have chest hair, a thick “happy trail”, chin hair, really thick peach fuzz on my face, and society has said I’m less of a female because of it. I will shave my “beard” or the black hair on my neck under my chin (it is typically 1” long and patchy), and pluck my “wild hairs” when my depression gets the better of me but, that’s rare.  I also don’t shave my legs. I haven’t in 5 years. I don’t wear shorts as I’m fairly modest and wear only pants to my ankles year around so summer doesn’t bother me. I don’t shave my feet. I trim my armpit hair only because I feel like society has taught me to; I last shaved them a month ago. I’ve never shaved my arms. I don’t shave pubic hair, as it was horribly itchy when I did as a teen. I don’t pluck my brows either.  I’m perfectly fine with my body hair. It’s society that has gotten into my, and others, thoughts. It’s time for  on  to stop interfering with daily life. ♥️
use a trimmer veet has one for woman in my  country i do it for my pubic hair because without hair i feel naked and like a 12 year old i shave legs and underarms bacause i like it more on me.
go shave
Be careful not to go to the other extreme! I'd say, if it makes you feel even a little bit uncomfortable in the summer when wearing dresses, then shave. It shouldn't be a big deal in my opinion, it's just nice to know for yourself that you're okay both ways :)
Yay!
who cares who shaves and who doesn't? it seems that in the us and Europe it is customary to inflate the usual problems to the size of the world scale. shaving or not is your personal choice .
imagine being THIS out of ideas for content... lol
I remember in middle school when I wore a dress with un shaved legs this boy made fun of me. From then on I was so ashamed of it and shave my legs. I'm sure I would've kept wearing dresses with hairy legs if no one said I looked gross lol  Really makes you think
I know this is TMI, but as a fellow lesbian, I prefer much less pubic hair on my women( in the past it was various women, now its just my wife).  If I'm going down south, I like my wife to be clean shaven.  IMHO, its cleaner and easier to get get to the naughty bits. LOL.
And everyone has a "gaze". There is the "Male Gaze" and the "Female Gaze" > Lesbian's "Gaze" and other women, so this idea that only Heterosexual men have a "Gaze", or that women rarely ever have a "Gaze", is dishonest, cowardice, and devoid of reality. Ingrid Nilsen, Just embrace your inner lesbian and stop pretending that it's men that your deeply into. Many lesbians love a hairy woman, so no need to worry about their sexual desires.
I think to an extent body hair grooming does have to do with cleanliness. The reason in the food industry has workers put up their hair and have nets for beards because it’s you know gross to have one’s hair in your food. My own opinion I prefer to not have body hair since I feel cleaner. When beards grow very long they can look unruly. But what ever floats your boat.
I stopped shaving my armpits because the skin there is very sensitive for me and shaving would leave me with painful rashes....and the reaction from other women was really disappointing to me. Family members were saying it was disgusting and freaky. I really don't see the big deal.
this is not new for me. im 13 years old and ive always had hair. like one time when i was 10 ( i was a stupid kid that was oblivious to social standards) i went to sea world with hairy legs. and even if i shaved my arms and legs, i have hair on my buttcheecks, lower back, stomach, neck and other areas. i hate shaving so i will just wax my arms and legs and stop there.
I use men’s beard scissors for trimming my body hair. They’re the perfect size and work super well! Great video. 💕
Most people that say "I shave for myself" wouldn't be able to go out without shaving. So, there's that
People will be so quick to say she’s being a feminazi or some crap but like it’s literally just a human topic and it’s interesting as hell. Like it becomes something I don’t even notice, I just don’t wear shorts if I haven’t shaved or I won’t lift up my arms, but like those little things aren’t things that you should have to do. This history and the placement of razors was so interesting because it obviously has  influenced society in ways we never think of.
Ya know it’s weird that we have body hair anyway. At 63 I don’t shave my legs anymore cause who cares. Stopped shaving pubic area. I think I will stop arm pits see how it is. Back in the 60’s we didn’t shave so let’s stop and enjoy what nature gave us. Great video! I don’t like the few dark hairs on my upper lip that started in my late fifties! Think I will continue waxing them though not very often anyway!
In terms of options, I have a friend who buzzes their underarms and legs. I shave my legs and arms about once a month because I'm comfortable with it up to that length. For pubic hair I trim it with those silver-colored cosmetic scissors because they're sharp enough and easy to clean. Body-odor wise, I use deodorant marketed towards men because it's made to go over body hair, where some deodorants marketed towards women are intended for a smooth surface.
Hi Ingrid! 👋 When you said, “I’m a real human being, and I’m nervous for summer” it made me lol for real. 😁 Did you notice in your research that some religions also regulate body hair? While that might not affect u personally, it probably reinforces cultural perceptions both for (Sikhism) and against (Islam). It might be an interesting angle to further pursue this topic, since faith is a huge influence on the world population.
I’m lazy about shaving, and only really shave my pits and my legs. I’ve actually always been told we have body hair FOR hygeine reasons, because it keeps things from getting into delicate areas. Don’t know if that’s actually true for all areas but I like to think hair exists for a reason.... Occasionally I’ll shave my fuzz on my lip and a little in the pubic area but not too much because it irritates my skin. My pubic hair only makes me feel gross over my period but I also know it catches a lot of my blood or discharge and keeps it from moving around my nethers even more. I keep my arm hair because it’s light in color and no one ever told me to shave it growing up; no one seems to care about that. It’s not like it keeps growing longer and longer; eventually it just stops. In the winter I never shave my legs because I can wear tights or I’m wearing pants. However when I walk around my house pants-less my vents are at the floor and it blows my hair, or I can feel it brush against the other leg’s hair, and that’s usually when I decide to shave it. My pit hair is so sparse and it’s such a quick fix that i just shave without even thinking about it; I feel like applying cream deodorant would be too messy with longer hair. 

I really appreciate you taking the educational/historical approach and sharing your own struggle with accepting it. People are going to criticize anything they don’t also do or agree with, but you’ve never been one to shy away from the tough stuff and that’s admirable for sure.
Dear god. People think way too much into things. If you feel disgusted by your own hair, why is that a big deal if you shave it? I can understand you wanting to "challenge" yourself (and I guess "social norms"?) but I don't get why its such a big deal if you DON'T shave. It's not a journey, and I disagree with having "a relationship" with body hair. You either shave or you don't, you feel happier to shave or you don't. If you want to have it, do your thing. If you're scared about summer, then shave! I don't understand. History is history. Are we now saying the layout of stores are offensive? Razors in the "hygiene" section, or maybe it's just the toiletries section. Who cares.
I personally love shaving/waxing and that’s what makes me feel good but power to any one who feels the same or different!! your body isn’t anyone else’s concern
I fell victim to the need to remove all of the hair on my body for a long time. I had my ahhaa moment a few years back. I've been in a serious relationship since 2012 and was regularly shaving & getting Brazilian waxes (which adds up to A LOT of money... amiright ladies?) Then one day in around 2016 I didn't have the money to get a wax so I pushed back my appointment. Two weeks later when I was supposed to go back I was bleeding so I pushed the appointment back again. It was about a week or so later that my boyfriend noticed what he now so lovingly refers to as "the bush" and he just looked at me and I said "I like this, why do you always shave it off?" I was SHOOK! I had spent YEARS of my life believing that men wouldn't want to be with me if I had this "disgusting body hair" and it turns out the complete opposite was true! From there I slowly stopped shaving my legs and armpits out of sheer laziness and when that didn't bother him either I felt so stupid for ever doing anything I did't want to do just because I thought someone would not accept me for it. I know not every person is lucky enough to meet such open minded partners who just want you to be happy with yourself but it was def. a pivotal moment in my journey of self love. I just wanted to share my story and send some love to all you ladies & gents out there whether you're rocking some body hair or not (:
Gross
Can you explain why you cut your hair and keep your brows groomed but you don't shave? Gross
No ones saying you have to shave your hair. Just dont be offended when there are people who find it repulsive. Everyone is allowed to have their own standards. Why be salty when people don’t like it and try to pull the "empowerment" card? It really isn’t that deep. Shave if you want to, don’t shave if you don’t. 🤷‍♀️
Well my armpits gets really stinky with too much hair so for me it is really part of hygiene 
But I never shaved them, after shaving hair becomes very dark and spiky, I prefer epilation
I believe what is most interesting is not why shaving or not. You do what you want: it's your body, it's your life. And, if you want to persuade people how beautiful it is and it feels let your hairs grow, good luck with that. What is really interesting is how the heck some people think that this is so interesting and publicly engage for or against. Yet, at the end of the day, you scored your 200K hits, and that's what matters, doesn't it?
🤢🤢🤢🤮
Why do you think not shaving is such an achievement? I don't understand. People don't mind what you do or don't. If you think they do, or if a small proportion of them does and it affects you, you may have a complex. And, really, if your problem is body hair, you are quite privileged, dear.
You can still be a real human being and remove the hair, its just human's nature since years and years. 
I don't understand what being open minded has to do with your underarm hair. 
When you start denying human nature once, you will just continue to deny all human other natures subsequently, hence this result!
Personally as a woman, I think feminine body hair is gross. But if you want to have hairy bits that’s your prerogative 👍🏻
YES yes yes!!!! I love this!!! Stay true <3
Imagine a guy making a video about why he stopped shaving his balls.
Hey Ingrid
o.o
I’m just going to say it...I don’t get why women want hair everywhere? I love when my body is freshly shaved and smooth. My partner appreciates it as well. I’m ok with people if they don’t want to shave, but I’m going to be honest...society has set the standard for hygiene for women and I don’t think that’s ever going to change. If you see women in public with underarm or leg hair they are judged. I know it’s not right but they are. It doesn’t take much to shave so I feel the benefits far outweigh the negatives...which I don’t see any negatives to shaving.
You do you girl :) but I could never do this. I have really sensitive skin and shave my legs once every 2-3 weeks. When I apply body lotion to my legs with a good amount of hair my legs feel so sticky...the equivalent of not washing out conditioner from your hair in the shower. I hate that feeling so I stopped applying body lotion to the point where the skin under the hair on my legs was getting really dry. Now I let my leg hair grow into the prickly stage and then I shave again. For me it's not about hygiene or following "fashion" it's all about my personal skin needs and what makes me physically feel comfortable.
But honestly, who cares?
Hey Ingrid, 
Honest question. If this is how you feel about body hair then would the same principles apply to showering?
Ahhhhh !! Lol I feel it’s so strange for a woman to have hair like this. If this is what u like then U go girl. I would be so embarrassed to wear that shirt in case people in public see it lol
Ingrid you are very brave! I don’t think I’ll ever be able to grow out my natural body hair, but that’s a cool idea to do one day for myself(:
Ew
With a name like Ingrid you should definitely have hair under your arms.
IMO.....leg hair on women isn’t nice. Underarm hair is fine.
Seriously armpit hair is gross either on women or men you all should shave
You are weird and neurotic
American 😪
It's disgusting  Honesty  Feel nausea 🤢🤮😵
It’s time to get a big girl job
Leave it to Ingrid to think “not shaving” is something unique she’s doing. As someone who was teased hard care bc my arm hair was dark I learned very quickly that your biology is normal. Humans have hair for a reason and if you choose to shave it good for you and if you don’t that’s fine too. Nothing new here move along.
Wow this channel is low now on views .... time to reinvent yourself
Its really disgusting to see armpit and pubic hair 🤮🤢🤢 even if it’s natural, what’s wrong with being clean and soft ? You people in the next few years will encourage peeing in public and you’ll say “ Oh ! Its a natural thing you should not be ashamed of , its part of our body “ !! These are disgusting things you don’t need to show it to people
PSA:
I’m a guy, please shave your effing under arms. I’d tell the same to my little girl
It’s not a big deal Ingrid. If you don’t want to shave, don’t shave. I don’t understand the long drawn out video over something so simple.
you sound so dumb....lack of video topics??? lol
I am all about growth and developing yourself but uhm bodyhair......NO! No hippie lifestyle for me :/
Eugh. Gross! It's the hair bear bunch
Your mustache is beginning to show, nice. How about ur eyebrows?
Shaving is being clean. You are just being stupid and putting this with "beauty". Shaving doesn't keep the smell in. You need to shave just like brushing your teeth. Please stop teaching these young girls the wrong things.
Thats just nasty and repulsive I cant handle men who dont shave their pits but now women !!!  The odor from sweat is caused by bacteria and the bacteria can multiply in the damp area of armpit hair shaving the armpits results in less space for bacteria to breed and increased effectiveness from your deodorant products .. there are thousands of scientific proof that shaving armpit hair reduces sweat and odor !!! The fuck is wrong with you people 🤮🤢
Can you make a video about books you’re currently reading, podcasts you’re binging, Netflix shows you are loving, and youtubers you can’t get enough of?
That “BOSS” necklace though
"I hope wherever you are, you are staying warm for winter" - lol I'm in Australia, it's the middle of summer and I have ice cubes down my pants
Thanks for this, Ingrid. I'm laying under a blanket shivering while watching this. The cold weather must be stopped!
We're so happy to call you a belifer, Ingrid! 💘💘
Because of you i tried Joe Malone’s honeysuckle and Davana and i love it. I got sooo many compliments when i went out. My uber driver, some guy at the bar, lots of guys. Thanks! 😀😀
Ingrid you look so happy and glowy and well rested! 💓 love your product recommendations.
Yay I've been needing this.
We are loving keeping your lips kissu-ble with this treasure! We can't wait to see what favs you have in store once it gets a little warmer! 💜
Sending some hugs from Austria to NYC 😊 it's just brilliant to see how happy you are in your new home
Aww you're so cute!! That haircut suits you so much! You'd look beautiful anyway, but wow, I just opened this and <3
Your appearance has changed exponentially over the past 5 years
When you can’t afford anything Ingrid likes anymore 😭😭😭
I can definitely attest to the necessity of Lanolips as a fellow New Yorker, also subject to the extreme weather fluctuations and dryness haha. Although- I read that the umbrella is coated in Teflon, which is something to be wary of ( highly recommend the Netflix documentary "the devil we know" to learn more about the ecological impact/impact on human health if you're into environmentalism- it's truly astonishing). I'm happy you're acclimating well to your new home and embracing the nooks and crannies this city has to offer^-^
Love the "BOSS" necklace! Where did you get it?
does your face ever feel sensitized? because tatcha & belif have fragrance in most if not all of their products, and i'm scared to try any lol
Yasss, I love wearing jackets with several pockets aka jacket purse, especially while traveling! ;)
Wanted that jacket then I realized it was $440.00 wow..... wish I could get it tho!! It’s pretty cute & looks warm!
I want that coat so bad!! I'm from Toronto Canada and that's a coat I need!
You need way more belif in your life. The moisture bomb, aqua bomb, witch hazel toner 🙌
Such a comprehensive video!! Love all the products and items!! Thank you, Ingrid! <3
Shiiiii I need that jacket. GIMME THE POCKETS
sounds like there is a cat purring next to your mic.
Ingrid. You gotta tell us where that necklace is from!!!
Long underwear is a must when it’s -20 out
Teflon is terrible for the environment!!!!
bag balm is the original lanolips and has existed for over 100 years. plus it's way cheaper.
Wow, I love how often you have been uploading lately , Ingrid! Keep up the wonderful work as always girl. Stay smiling and much love!🤗💕
For the wool layering- I want to get the tights and top but how does it work when indoors? I’ll probably wear them under a pair of jeans and a sweater but I dont want to overheat inside 😰
you should try heat tech by uniqlo i love it more than smart wool, the socks are softer and warmer!
That pocket-loving thing is so relatable! I got so mad every time when I find out my jackets or coats don't come with any pockets!
i watch tati a lot and no shade to her but it’s nice hearing someone appreciate fragrance in their products. and at first i didn’t find that black jacket that special but all the pockets really sold me lol
I absolutely love your enthusiasm about pockets. 
Also, I agree. Woman’s clothing could always do with more pockets.
Just in the nick of time! I have been needing a super moisturizing mask and this is a price I feel happy about. 😁👐
Haha When Ingrid said "Moisture cocoon" it cracked me up. I, too, love sleeping in a moisture cocoon, Ingrid!!!
Such a great video!  Love your positive energy!
The belif sleep mask sounds exactly like what I need! Thanks for all the tips and products in this video!
LOVE the Boss necklace girl!! ❤ hehe, much love from the UK x
Hey Ingrid!I love everything you do and represent. No matter who is on the other side of the screen, you are a great inspiration to all. Being happy is a decision and fighting for the true identity of each one is essential. Much love from Argentina!
Stop scrolling for a sec ✋






I make music btw. Tell me what u think 💯
Ingrid's videos are so calming <3
I loved this!! Now I need to go buy a pair of long underwear!
You’ve sold me on that jacket. I moved to Seattle almost two years ago and I still don’t have a nice, thick, water-repellant coat. Definitely adding this to my list!
Lovely products! But then, I knew you would go for only the best. I also came across a few great winter care products at the coupon website Kiindly. Waiting for your next review!
Wait, wait, wait, hold on - silk long underwear?? Tell me more, please, I missed that....!
Thanks for this video, Ingrid! You seem so happy lately, it's wonderful to see :)
OMG I'm all about that "jacket-purse" life too! It's so handy when you don't want to carry a purse or backpack!
maaan where was this video when I was in New York three weeks ago lol. I have noted everything for next time. Still loving the content. 🥰
Smartwool socks for the win.
‘Jacket Purse ‘ was so funny 😂! ❤️ from NY too!
Girl your skin looks so good! 💞
The Belif sleeping mask is my current favorite right now! It feels like you're dipping your finger in jelly and the smell is delish :)
i Didn't kno what dry skin was until I Lived in The midwest. I didn't know what summer rain was all about until I moved to New England.
"here I am again, and this one is MINE" you guys are so cute
I love Briogeo now because of you!
Your voice is so relaxing 😌
I love Belif products! My skin is normally super oily and I love using their Aqua bomb moisturizer year round and their eye cream. Now that it’s winter time my skin is really dry and I recently discovered their sleeping mask at Sephora. I got a sample and I’ve been wanting to buy it but I keep second guessing myself and now I think you just confirmed that I need it in my life!
You can add an essential oil to your fragrance free body lotion to make it smell nice :)
Love this. I was only saying this week that I wished my dress had pockets. 🙃 and I’m with you on the wool socks - essential. ☺️
I love that necklace! Where is it from??
your hair looks so tamed..😬
The room you're in looks so pretty.
moisture cocoon tutorial?? :)
Smartwool is seriously the best!!!
:D
Was interested in Necessaire but disappointed to see palm oil as the first ingredient.
Love it <3
Way to find an article of women's clothing that actually has a pockets, and pockets large enough to put something in! The lack of (useful) pockets is so annoying! Especially in hiking/outdoor clothing where you need pockets to hold things like a knife, your phone, snacks, a gps etc... Then when you look at the mens clothing, they're full of pockets and they're good size!
I definitely need to try some of these products out!!
This is sooo useful thank you 😊
I love your necklace 🥰🥰
Hi Ingrid!
You and Maia Mitchell are like twins!
yes for a beauty fridge tour !
I feel like "snug/snogg" (I have no idea how you write it ^^) is a typical Ingrid expression ^^
Woa a black umbrella that folds up and down :O
everything is black yes me, all day every day
I’d love to see you partner with a menstrual cup company especially with the attention you’ve personally brought to the pink tax ✌🏽
I love belief, and these kinds of videos!
Love the clothes part❤️
“PAHHHH KETTTTS”
“We love pockets!” Hahahaha so true! 😂😂
Really love love love your jacket it is simply awesome
Love Jo Malone for some self care pampering!
I love how practical your videos are now. I feel like the gayer I get the more practical I become so your videos really resonate with me these days lol
Hi Ingrid! Could you maybe do a nighttime/morning routine please? Thanks!
The body scrib, jacket, and umbrella look awesome.  Have a great day.
How can someone so lovely?? She's exremely lovable.. 😍😍🤗🤗
okay this is a really dumb question, but if you wear long underwear like in this video, you still need to wear normal underwear underneath it too right?
Ingrid's new vidB-)
Ingrid !!!!!!!💕
I see the hair is still with us...
she still friends with eileen? idk how to spell her name
Pocket envy
I have the same umbrella!
Vaseline literally has no scent lol
Hi
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Another sponsored video
@ingridnilsen i would have messaged you but I have sent you messages in the past on Instagram and i know you wont see it! 
Im saying this out of love but when was your last dental visit? Ive noticed your smile has changed quite a lot lately, probably due to some really significant staining or interproximal cavities that may be going on. I just cant tell exactly what is going on that well from your videos or pictures but I've been in dentistry for 12 years  and just wanted to point it out because it's a very noticeable differencd to me - please dont ignore and just stay on top of it! ❤️
Ingrid, you used to have the whitest teeth!!!!! I remember thinking how does she get her teeth that white!
to all those girly girls out there I think you might like my YouTube channel
She s like me i like too wear much black clothings
ILY INGRID TY
Hey Ingrid
I just wanna say is that I’m looking forward to the day when I do become as a Lesbian.

But not just yet not until I actually kiss a male for the first time.
You are doing only sit down videos. Making money but with less effort. 👎🏿
love this collaboration. thank you for shining a light on these important discrepancies!! hopefully we can come together, learn, & find ways to empower women around the world.
Love what Ingrid is doing with her channel! Great, meaningful content.
Thanks to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, I was able to attend an early college high school where I met my now husband. We both graduated with bachelors degrees by age 20. I just finished my masters program at 23. My brother got his PharmD at 22.  🙌🏻🙌🏻 They do a lot for education.
This is v important! So exciting how you got to sit and talk to Melinda Gates! True honor💛
WOAH this video is MAJOR!!!!!
Melinda Gates is so down to earth! I'm so thankful that I got to meet her and Bill as a Gates Millennium Scholar! :)
Ingrid, I am so proud of you! You are so well spoken and professional when conducting these interviews! You were made for this!
Very upsetting fact is that women are still neglected when it comes to medical science. There is some serious lack of research funding when it comes to illnesses that affect mostly women. More money is invested in research of male baldness than ME/CFS, an illness where 75 percent of sufferers are women. Take autoimmune diseases, endometriosis, migraine... There is one type of hernia where 90 percent of cases are women. I tried to find an image of it but almost all of them were of male anatomy.
I remember that interview you had with President Obama and how he was surprised about the luxury tax on period products! It’s so cool that some states have removed it and others are in the process of doing it! This was an amazing video 👏🏻
If more people were like the Bill and Melinda the world would be a better place. I highly recommend the book "The most good you can do " by Peter Singer if you want to make a difference
Great vid Ingrid! X
Love from Bangladesh!!!! <3
I'm just obsessed with your vidoes 
Love your accent and style and offcourse your haircut ❤️😍
INGRID! You're such a girl boss. This is honestly such a cool video. Thank you.
This is so great and so needed!!
This was such an amazing and insightful video, Ingrid!! Thank you for sharing such knowledge with us all!! You truly do radiate such a wealth of information and hopefulness! 💛👏🏼
Ingrid, so proud of you! Love the content you're bringing to your channel this year. Love the open conversation you had with Melinda. So badass. ♡
Love this video!!!!
You are so smart and an immense inspiration for many out there like myself ! Always looking forward to your intellectual videos! Thank you !!!!
This is amazing, I can’t believe it doesn’t have more views!
The ending of this video is so powerful, Ingrid. Lovely video. 💕
What a thoughtful and informative video! Love the way your channel is progressing and bring important issues to the light! Always remain an optimist 💕
Ingrid, you are a great interviewer and such a positive influencer. Your words are powerful and meaningful. Thank you for what you do!
Love this! Thank you Ingrid and Melinda for this interview!
I learned a lot. I love this kind of content. It means a lot. Thank you for your using your platform wisely. I have so much respect for you.
Something you would know, having been close with Hannah Hart, is her motto “Practice Reckless Optimism”.  I feel like looking for the good in people in the face of all this hatred being spewed is reckless and subversive.  As someone posted to Amanda Palmer’s Instagram, “kindness is punk rock”.
yesss Ingrid what a baddie making moves with the luxury tax
Great interview; very informative. 👍🏼
But don't digital literacy problems (especially with women) in those parts of the world also stem from a lot of their cultures being male dominated?
Wow, I teared up a bit when you said you had actually caused the luxury tax to be taken off period products for several states. Well done, Ingrid.
I appreciate both of you
They discussed many interesting topics I haven't thought of before. I'm glad you shed a light on  the topic that I wasn't aware of.
Wish there was more of an emphasis on the harsh realities of poor working class women in the global south, how damaging capitalism has been in their lives and how patriarchy AND capitalism work together to oppress working class women of color.
Love of the Worlds thanks Ingrid Nilsen u re a good inspiration
Shout to your mom for continuing her education 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💃💃💃💃
Thank you, Ingrid and Melinda for this collaboration!
What a lovely lady! :) So many people make assumptions based off of their wealth when in reality they are very genuine and kind individuals who give generously.  Thanks for this great interview!
You are such a breath of fresh air on the internet and truly a gift to your viewers 💕👍🏼
"From our friend... WARREN BUFFET"
Well done!! This is such an achievement .
Great video ❤️ you look beautiful btw
Aww congrats to your mom!! You go girl!
Cool interview! :D <3
Loving your content!!
I am so happy I watched until the very end! Well done Ingrid!
Super interesting to watch!
The 3 carrot ring!
Ingrid, you are actually the first YouTuber I subscribed to many, many moons ago. Just wanted to share that I am so thankful your content has evolved with your age. It is so refreshing in a space where 26 year olds are producing the same content from their teen years. I appreciate that you’re using your platform to inform and educate. YouTube needs a lot more of this content for the mature viewer. Keep it up!👍🏼
Here's to refusing despair x
This is such an important video to make and you are so talented and are really helping women by doing what you are. Ingrid you are a huge motivation and inspiration
Ingrid you are so inspiring!
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO OF ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME
how tf did u get melinda gates on here
Thank you. I needed to hear your message of optimism so badly. I am an empath and I suffer from debilitating depression. While I objectively know my mental illness is caused by brain chemistry, it tends to get the best of me mostly because of all the pain and hurt I see, hear and feel in the world.  I needed to hear that optimism is not naivety, but positivity. Acknowledge the bad, and then look for the good. Ingrid, I don’t know if you believe in God, but I do, and I believe He put you in my path to teach me how to be more thoughtful, more optimistic and more myself. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 💕
👏👍❤️
You still make videos? Damn I thought this channel was deadddddd
Amazing!!!
Ingird- you are just soooo goood!
Like your channel
Love this!
Did you get more money ?
Love this♥️♥️
BLEH
Why doesn’t Melinda run for President?  The Democrats have a bunch of monkeys that will do as they are told. This is going to lead to Trumps re-election.
4 are stupid questions
:-)
DATA IS SEXIST
66k people participated in Ingrid’s survey, but only 14k people in two days cared to come watch the video? I have followed and loved Ingrid for years, and it really bums me out how this channel is getting forgotten 😢
Wonderful wonderful video!!!
lol ingrid butchered this interview
tax the wealthy is all I say.
interviewing someone whose family who is accused of supporting population control through vaccines, gmo food and planned parenthood makes you look like a puppet
Really love how this channel evolved! I have been watching for years, probably since her first year... Her more "minimalistic approach" to fashion, makeup, life style, is not only modern but light to the soul. I have stopped watching most youtubers for the over consumerist and fame focus videos. This content is definitely reflecting her viewers and her aging beautifully.
Pleeeaaase do more NYC videos! I'm thinking of visiting there this year or next
yes yes yes to the series! QUEER PLACES
I love this!! I want to bring a future gf to NYC! I’d also like to say that I came out to my mom a couple of weeks ago, and it was so nerve wracking. Watching your videos, like the coming out video, has helped me come to terms with it. I’m so thankful for you 🥰
yes please a nyc guide series would be amazing! i live in London but when I visit i love to go to non touristy things and experience the real new york city. Thanks for the tips Ingrid!
better wouldbe if you would take us to that places with camera and not just talk, also do more videos wih nyc like, vlogs, not just inside
You always look so beautiful. Awesome ideas 👍
I really love how often you have been uploading lately , Ingrid. Keep up the wonderful work with everything as always girl!🤗💕
I don’t know if I’ve ever been this early - I love this video and really want to check these things out next time I’m in NYC even though I’m single af!
Your hair is adorable! I loveeeee going to the high line in nyc for a date. It’s chill and you have a beautiful view 💞
groupmuse sounds so wonderful! 💕🎶
...also definitely keeping these in mind for when i visit nyc 🥰🗽
You seem so much happier in nyc. Love that.
Loved this video! Could you make more videos about NYC?
Literally moved to New York a week ago and my boyfriend visits in a week! This video was perfect!!
Yes to more NYC videos!! I'm currently away for school but I find that I have more appreciation and awareness for the city whenever I do return during breaks! Even hearing about NYC related things make me feel connected to home. Thank you for your videos throughout the years, and I'm so happy that you've found the place where you feel most at home!
The midi insightful, wholesome youtuber ever!! Where my small YouTuber squad at?? Let's support each other loves 💕💕💕
WOW Ingrid, you must have read my mind. I can't wait to try out these ideas. THANK YOU! <3
I adored this! I would absolutely love if you continued the series, especially one on coffee stops as you mentioned! Maybe another on healthy/vegan places or pizza places if you have any experience with that! 💓
I don’t even live in New York and I would love a New York series !!!
This makes me wanna visit New York again!<3 Hugs from Norway!:D<3
Cool video, you're the only YouTuber I set the speed to 1.75 though. Not trying to dis, jus an observation
Thanks for this video! It is really useful! ❤ xo!
Yes, please make more of this videos. They are really helpfull. Love from Argentina!
As a classical musician who has done many groupmuses in the Bay Area and beyond, they are lovely! I'm so glad you mentioned it! Let's keep Groupmuse alive! <3
Absolutely love this piece of content Ingrid. It's different and refreshing. I would LOVE to sign up to one of the Muse Groups. Let me see is there is one in Mumbai.
 Thank you for this valuable content! 💞
I would seriously love if you did more New York videos! That sounds so fun to watch! 
Thanks for your content, Ingrid. I always love watching your stuff 💛
Awesome, thanks for the tips. ;) Would love a video on queer places in NYC.
I love how your channel has changed for the last few months. I love every content of yours. I'm watching them multiple times. Thank you for your amazing content!
I REALLY NEEDED THIS!! 😩❤️👌 Thanks 🙏
The activities sound amazing.  Please do series with stuff you are loving at moment in New York City.
I found you through the suggested videos. First your videos are very informative. I just started a YouTube Channel so I am definitely doing my research. Thanks For your help. Keep it up! Just Subscribed.
More NYC videos please! It's my favorite city and I visit often. Ps I've been addicted to your videos lately 👍🏼
Ingrid, watching your content makes my heart full and warm and wonderfully content and curious. I am going to NYC for a business trip later this month (my first time in NYC!) and really looking forward to fitting some of these ideas into my time there. Love to see you glow with joy when speaking about NYC!! Makes me incredibly excited for my trip!! <3
I'd love to hear more about New York from you! My best friend and I are planning out first trip there this spring/summer and we really want to see more than tourist destinations. They're fun for a while but after a few days you've kind of seen them all 🤷🏼‍♀️
I love your videos ♥️💖 and yes! Please do more videos about NYC. Totally. X, Hila.
Please do this series!! I think it would be so much fun, especially since you're so passionate about ny
Please do a series in New York City! I've lived in NY for so long and your series would totally help when I need inspiration~
this is amazing Ingrid, thank you so much! Im a flight attendant and I go alot to New York so I will try all of those things!
As a fellow New Yorker I LOVE this type of content and finding new things to do!
Thank you for this video! I would have loved it even more if you could have included some footage for each idea
this is such an awesome video idea me and my partner will definitely be checking some of these places out thank you!!!
Hi Ingrid! I’ve been watching for years😊
This was such a wonderful video! I have been meaning on planning a trip to NYC and this was so helpful!! Thank you Ingrid!!
You look so cute! Love your sweater and makeup! ❤️
Thanks for talking about NY! I LOVE IT
Yes, I'd definitely watch that series! I really want to make it to New York within the next year and I love learning about the city.
Omfg thank god you made this vid... I lived in NY my entire life and I had no idea of what to do thats different for valentines day
Love the NYC series idea! I'm there in April and will be going on your suggestions!
Do more videos like this! I would love one on best Tea houses, & I love the ideas of the best queer places as well.
More videos like that preferably by may time when I visit! All of the places are going on my list :) thank you
This is great! I’m moving to New York in a little over a month and I loved these tips to help the city feel less daunting. Could you do a video on tips for making friends in NYC?
More NYC things you love for sure! Loved this!
Love the NYC videos ,, thanks for sharing,, look forward to more
I’ve been watching your videos for some years now❤️ and I still love your channel ❤️
Yes do a video of your favorite coffee shops in New York please!!
Yessss New York series! Always love hearing other people’s faves.
My favorite date spot is Veniero's pastries in the East Village :)
Ingrid! Thank you for this unique collection of NYC finds. I love NYC with all my heart and love visiting there to appreciate the non-touristy shops and restaurants. I'll be adding your picks to my wish list. I've come to NYC every year of my life but never solo and am excited to possibly visit on my first solo trip! I'd love to hear any advice you have traveling solo to NYC. Thank you! Happy Valentine's!
love love the way you approach youtube gurl <3
Thank you for the recommendation and I’m definitely checking them out.
I would definitely be interested in just cool places in NYC. I would like to see bookstores, coffee shops, etc.
Yes please! Would love to hear more about good, queer spots in nyc. Being a queer woman, finding queer spaces in other  cities is something I love to explore-somewhere I know will feel safe when being in an unknown town for the first time.
Did you do something differently to your hair?
Ahh these places sound so lovely!!
cough park slope does NOT represent most of Brooklyn
I love your mindful, calming approach. I’ve been watching you since the beginning! Your are the only YouTuber that I have watched consistently since the early days of YouTube
Yes 🙌 I would love to see more NYC videos! 🗽
Ingrid! 
I would LOVE a NYC series. Travelling in June from Melbourne for my 30th birthday. Would love tips about your beloved city! X
Yesss please ! I’m going to NYC in May and all of your recommendations are SO welcome!
Would love a video on queer places you’ve found in NYC 😀
Omg Ingrid, I live in nyc and host groupmuse I love it too. Let me know if you want to swing by. Would love to have you
Thanks for doing this.  I just moved to NYC 8 months ago and I love discovering new and fun places.  I'm so in love with this city and absolutely grateful to be living my dream of living here.  Please do more of these! :)
I absolutely loved this video! I’d love to hear all of your New York recommendations!
This is so great! Thank you Ingrid!
First 💖💕👍
Yes! Would love more NYC recommendations :)
I would love a NYC series! I love seeing the different parts of New York that aren’t well known or you can only know or experience if you lived there!
Would love a series of these sort of videos for sure! Also maybe vlog style videos of you exploring new places in NY could be fun too!
Have lived in NYC my entire life, honestly this video is clearly catered to the hipsters increasing the rent. NYC is becoming almost impossible to live in anymore because of this. Yes come see the really Brooklyn people being forced out of their homes daily.
Love this idea. ❤️😎
part 2!!
I want to visit NYC again soon! Thank you for your recommendations! Definitely another video like this!
Great suggestions for activities. Also; YES, please do tell me where I can get a decent cup of coffee in NYC. I have not had much luck so far... Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
This makeup and hairstyle makes you look 67 years old
Your hair is just amazing 😍
I love the idea of going for a walking tour where you live! That is such a lovely way to keep interested in your city. It's always the first thing I do when I'm visiting a new place if I can find a good one but it's never occurred to me to do one at home. Thanks for the tip :)
Thank you for sharing. Ingrid, I started watching your videos when you came out and let me tell you that your channel  is one of the only ones i always come back to, i know you went through a lot of changes but this content is really amazing, very honest and your kindness really shows. This is what makes youtube worth it, really. Here for the next 10 years!
I feel like we're gonna need a tour of Ingrid's impressive sweater collection sometime soon
Why this hair. WHY.
I love these unique ideas! I will definitely check out the tours and restaurants next time I’m in NYC!
Yessss more NYC lists and stories!!
Very interesting!  Thanks for the ideas.
More NYC videos and vlogs! Going to a concert next month and spending a week. We've already seen the touristy parts and now we wanna do something special
I haven't watched you in a long time and I'm confused......... Are you sick? You look really different and that's aside for getting older. 😶👀
A video of coffee house places would be SO appreciated! I like to go to them a lot on weekends to do some work, as I have seen many, maaaany people do also. If you could fit one of these videos in, it would be great! And if you DO get to do one, thank you in advance <3
Give some love to Staten Island!!! That Borough is A GEM
I just moved to NYC! so definitely want to see more NYC videos! :D
I’m subscribed to Ingrid but her videos never show up on my feed :(
Of course to the series!!!! I am living in NY and there are tons of places and things that I don’t know about. I love the fact that you explored it in a very unique and interesting ways
Go to the Transit Museum! It's a really cool place. I bet you'd like it!
Would love to see a NYC series of videos:) My husband and I adore New York, it’s our favorite city to visit!
sofar is similar to groupmuse, just different music ;)
I've been going to some concerts where you get to know the other people in attendance.  For niche music genres in particular areas, it's a big help.  One show was at an old 1800's theater on the Harvard campus.  Another was the City Winery in Boston's North End, where you sit down, and have dinner with other people as you listen to that night's musical guest (the night that I went, it was Tommy Emmanuel, an Aussie musician who is often seen as the best acoustic guitarist in the world).
You could go to food court in flushing too, or walk through roosevelt Ave and try the food, or go to a jazz bar in Harlem or city island for some fresh seafood.
Good video! As a New Yorker though you should come to Queens. There’s so many beautiful sites and delicious eateries in the borough :)
YES! More info about NYC please :) I'm going in July and that would be so helpful to get advice from a local.
Would LOVE a New York series!!!
Love your videos ❤️
I would love to see NYC guides in vlog style videos where you go there and take your camera and show us your favorite places/things to do in nyc!
Hi Ingrid, I'd like to see your favorite food truck / street food spots in NYC. Thanks!
The girl in the show good trouble reminds me of you a ton! Do u agree?
Yes to the NYC series!!!! 🗽💝
I go to Gotham archery all the time.  Let’s go!
Absolutely loved this! I live in LA and my boyfriend's in NYC, so I always resonated with your bicoastal life (before you moved to NYC officially). We're always looking for new things to do in the city so I can't wait to check these all out next month when I'm back there!!! I'd like to echo some comments below and say that I'd love some more NYC videos :)
More NYC suggestions please!
Love, love, LOVE videos like this!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
💙💙💙💙
Omg please do more NY related videos!!
Please do more videos like this
my girlfriend is moving to nyc soon so im definitely gonna send her this!! this video is very cute and yes to the queer places seriess!!!!!!
I really really want to go on a NYC date, that's the dream.
Lord Farquaad it you!
Love this video ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
to all those girly girls out there I think you might like my youtube channel
you could also do favourite places in other countries that you've visited, ie. favourite/most authentic restaurant in Paris
Hopefully I will live in New York one day!🙏🏼 God bless America!
Yes, best places to visit. I.e. organic food places (healthy), walking tours, safe areas to visit. When is the best time to walk there?? June? July? Enjoyed this video;).
had to watch this at the speed 1.75...
Not queer. But I love your queer content!
I love your sweater :)
Yes please more!
Do live in Park Slope or somewhere around Atlantic Ave? 🤔 I’m sure you won’t answer that but I BET you do because I did live there and the fact that you know about Al Di La then you must!
2:36 Farts 🤣
walking on the highlines is amazing too
coffee & queer nyc places please!!!!
Ingrid, I can tell you LOVE NYC!  Groupmuse sounds wonderful! My family loves to go to local concerts with our symphony, here, in Salisbury, N.C.  You mentioned that that was how music was originally performed. I remember when I was reading a biography about Albert Einstein,  the book talked about how he would go visit homes to play his violin with his other friends who played various instruments. How about that? I guess it was kind of like their version of a jam session!  ;)
♥️ this!!
I lived in NYC (east & west village, park slope, cobble hill) for almost 10 years and loved it. Towards the end of my time there my partner and I discovered Contra Dancing and fell in love with it. In fact, we hired some of the band players and caller for the Friday portion of our wedding and it was an amazing way for people to mingle, laugh, and be silly. Totally recommend trying out Contra Dancing. They have it in Park Slope!
i live in manhattan on UES and stumbled upon one of my favorite places in the city on a walk with my friend. we were walking down central park and saw the cooper hewitt museum and decided to give it a try. SO WORTH IT. we have the met, the whitney, guggenheim, but no one ever tells you about the wonder that is the cooper hewitt! it's a design museum and perfect for people that like interactive, fun exhibits. they're exhibits that cater to all of your senses and you can easily spend hours there. there's even a cafe with a GORGEOUS courtyard that's perfect for hanging on nicer days. my favorite hidden gem in our city!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I live in NY but not NYC ❤️
Yes to NY series!!!! Bookstores....coffee stores!! :-)
I loved this!!
More NYC inspired videos!
:)
Love your videos!
Thanks for sharing about Groupmuse! I’ll have to try it out. Just wanted to share that if you like listening to live music in intimate spaces, you should also look into SoFarSounds. It has a similar concept and is available in cities all around the world.
Mmm, Al Di La is a block away from my apartment but I've never been (I'm one of those locals you see lmfao). If you're ever feeling more casual, a block in the opposite direction of the barclays center is La Villa with the best Baked Ziti everrrr
Im obsessed with your New York videos!!!
Video 👌👍
more more more!!!
Something simular as the groupmuse is sofersounds.. It has concerts in peoples homes or garages or any place people can think of.. You can even organise one yourself.
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii dear its tara
Love ❤️
Please more NYC
Queer places please!
All the NY videos please ❤️
queer places please!
what’s goin on with your hair girl? you look like a grandma
great video!
To comendo ticolé é deeee melancia
Passinho do cocô
Hi, Ingrid! Could you speak faster? I speed up to 1.5 but still feel it is a lil bit slow.
Is it just me or are your teeth starting to get a bit stained ):
Cu
Your content now is so wonderful. I've just subscribed. There is so much talk about youtube channels dying, but it's clear that yours is growing: growing in maturity, depth, spirituality, positivity, all of which are so much more important than mindless views <3 these views are ones which have sparked thoughts, joy, reflection!
Love that your videos aren’t following a trend. You really have a unique channel and a emotional message with every video including your journey
Love the book videos!
Hi Ingrid, thank you so much for this wonderful list of recommendations! I just thought you would like to know that Eileen Myles now prefers they/them pronouns. I recently went to a reading where they referred to themselves as a “they/them lesbian” 🙂
I adore A Little a Princess!! My favorite movie from my childhood. The depths of emotions and circumstances hit me so hard to this day!
LOVED this video! It was such a creative way to share the love that's buzzing around this time of year
I love you and how often you have been uploading lately , Ingrid. Keep up the wonderful work with everything as always girl!🤗💕
This pink lipstick looks beautiful on you ❤
I've been loving your videos so much lately and I'm so super excited about you're going to share with us this year! I felt like this was such a cute and original idea for a video, and as a lover of love stories I'm so beyond happy for these new recommendations! 💕
Ingrid! I love when you talk about books. I've been watching this vid repeatedly. I'm in love with your content these days! Thank you Ingrid!
Are you on Goodreads?
I hope to find these books in France 🇫🇷 ❤️
this is the wholesome content i subscribed for
The Handmaiden (2016)
Who else is super excited for Valentine’s Day?
Love this! will you do more videos about books you've read? id love to know what non-fiction you've read that you like
I have been loving your content so much Ingrid! Keep it up :)
Pride and prejudice was beautiful honestly
The "Together for four decades, married four years" article was so beautiful. Thank you for showing that to me! Reading about that couple and their words about each other made my heart swell and swoon.
I love your YT channel I just subbed and you should keep up the good work
Yes! I will totally be watching Pride and Prejudice again soon. Thanks for the book and poem recommendations🌷✨
I love the modern love podcast!! I also recommend Terrible Thanks For Asking (not always about love per se, but really good as well)! 😊
How can you be so perfect 💙💜💗
Hey Ingrid! You should check out Unmarriageable by Soniah Kamal. The tagline of the novel is "Pride & Prejudice in Pakistan" and it came out last month. It's a very fun read! Thank you for the wonderful recommendations!
Love this! This year I’m focusing on positivity and acknowledging all the love I have in my life and this was perfect ❤️ MORE LOVE TO THE PEOPLE
It's cool, it's cool! But I just noticed a thing, I don't give a single damn anymore about Valentine's Day at all now. Thank you for reminding me that. 👍
I love this video so much! Please make a part 2 if you have anymore :)
I adore A Little Princess. Both the book and the film are great (also recommend The Secret Garden by the same author)
Did you ever watch The Secret Garden movie? Also done around the time of Little Princess. Highly recommend!!!!
I recently bought a copy of A Little Princess and have also been eyeing the movie on Netflix, and your recommendation has definitely given me a reason to check them out soon! 💕 I loved the Secret Garden as a child, so I have high expectations 😊
I love your simple makeup! So pretty! And I LOVE Ingrid book videos!!!
As many others have said, I have been truly loving your content lately. It is meaningful and thoughtful. What a unique youtube channel with so much to offer. Thanks Ingrid!
Who doesn't love pride and prejudice! The ultimate romance story ❤️
Loved this, Ingrid! Will definitely be checking out that Podcast!
thank you so much! you are so wonderful, you have grown so much~ ♥
I have been subscribed to you for probably years now and it’s truly inspiring to see you come into your own as a person and an artist 💖
Pride & Prejudice 1995 version is my favourite tv series (book adaptation) ever. I rewatch it once a year and I never get bored of their story.
I will have a look at your recommendation because I have to admit all of them were new to me apart from Pride&Prejudice.
You should check out the book "Love is a Mixtape" by Robb Sheffield
#N0TIFICATI0NSQUAD!!!!!!!!!
A little princess is one of my all time favorite movies. I always watch it when I’m in the mood for a good cry😊
I love "A Little Princess"!!! <3
I love the modern love podcast Ingrid!!!!! It's amazing.
Omg I love the miniseries!! Used to watch it when we were sick as kids on VHS haha which is like 6 tapes btw also loooovee The little princess just watched it again the other day and was literally sobbing
Really interesting video! Is saw on a bookstore the first book you talked about but in french cause I'm French and I really wanted to buy it. I will someday and the other things you talk about look so inspiring and joyful!
Ahh I love this video!! Please do a series of your fav books 💗
A Little Princess was one of my favorite childhood memory.
I really love your videos! Just love your honesty and gentle vibe and how positive they feel! I've added these books to my To-Read list, can't wait to read Modern Lovers!
This is a WONDERFUL video idea! Love it!
Ingrid! You look so beautiful in this video! I love that bright lipstick!
I know you loved Dear Sugars, and since they are now done :( I was thinking you might love my new fave advice podcast. It is called han and matt know it all. And it is an advice podcast where they also discuss other advise collumns
Loved this, Ingrid!
Ingrid this I’m so glad what you said about Modern Lovers because the description of the book on amazon doesn’t tell you about the lesbian couple,  and tho I was intrigued about the book thinking that it was all straight couples turned me away from it. Now days I prefer to consume lgbtq content more than no lgbtq at all.
I love the little princess. Also I can't wait to read that book.
I am SO excited to put these on my list!!! What a lovely video idea, thank you Ingrid!
oooo definitely going to check out the Walt Whitman poem! 😍
If any of you like fantasy trilogies and the star crossed lovers theme, i highly recommend "the winner's curse" trilogy by marie rutkoski.
You mentioned two of my favorite things ever. The BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice which is perfection! I have a two dvds of it because I wore one of them out from watching it so much. And A Little Princess! That movie is my childhood, I love everything about and when she starts screaming “Papa!” Ans she’s being carried away 😭 it cuts me so deep in my heart. I’m going to have to rewatch that film now.
You're one of the best women I've ever met ♥
Try Will You Marry Me by Unee!
Have you read "The Museum of Modern Love"?
Sending you good vibes!
Who doesn't love a love story?
I love how you talk slowly and put your thoughts into words. So often, people talk with "umms" and "you know" and you lose the actual point they are trying to make. When you talk, I can feel all the emotions that you are feeling and every thought is so well put together :)
this is such a cute idea and I'll make sure to check these recommendations out!
I’m so excited to check out your recommendations! I haven’t seen a little princess in ages!!
Oh God! A little princess was such a favourite of mine! A really really great movie!
Walt Whitman is also a gay literary icon!
One of my favorite weed movies also is Romeo And Juliet.
46th view!!
A Little Princess ♥️
You’re awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have been loving the fosters on Netflix. The Adams fosters know how to love. They are two women who love each other and have adopted four different kids to make a family. They teach about love, family, loving you no matter who you love because there adopted son is gay they treat him no differently. They teach forgiveness, second changes, and something I want someday  is the  love for each  other no matter what life thoughs at them. Go watch.
I love this so much! I tried to see if jerry mahoney was on the internet to see how his kids were doing and it's so cool to see that he writes books for kids and his kids are so much older now! I also have modern lovers and this is motivating me to finish it <3
I love the little princess!!!!
Great vidéo Ingrid !
Omg A Little Princess! Such an absolutely precious movie. Everyone should see it!
Hey Ingrid
Look at how many views ur getting these days oh god. You used to be such a big deal what happened??
I think you've genuinely come in to your own as a creator, and your intentional, soft, quiet content is so important. So many youtubers, with their high energy and screaming, make for an exhausting watching experience(now granted, I love me a high energy vid). But I love the grace of this. It makes me happy to have watched you grow.
I realized in 2018, at age 31, that I was living a life I didn't want, becoming a person I didn't want to be, and that I didn't know what my purpose was in life. It was a very painful year for me and I ended up quitting my job, moving across the country, and essentially starting over. I had to let go of an idea I had of myself and learn to define myself without thinking about wealth, power, status, labels, material things, etc. I never thought I was chasing the wrong things until I realized that I wasn't really living my life, but enduring it.
Love these deeper video, Ingrid. You have a powerful voice, can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you! 😘
Letting go of friendships that were very one-sided. It was tough because I would think about the times when I was so close to that person and it would drive me to try and keep the friendship alive, but sometimes things don't work out and that's ok.
Hey Ingrid! Thank you for sharing with us 💓
One of the habits I left in 2018 is hating my flaws and imperfections
You're such a lady boss. Thank you for making content that actually matters. 

Honestly, I've let go of the "beauty community" on YouTube and on all other social media. I stopped watching and following a lot of the old YouTubers that I used to really enjoy. I did this because I genuinely think that it's healthier to live my life without surrounding myself with product placements. I found myself longing for material things that I actually don't care about and wishing I had lifestyles that I actually don't want.

You're the only former "beauty guru" that I still follow, because you're authentic, and I appreciate you.
The alcohol one was super interesting and insightful. It’s almost like it’s used (for some people) as a crutch to be more relaxed and outgoing, but you’re actually preventing yourself from making true strides towards self improvement and genuine connection. Love this video!
I LOVE how thoughtful your content has been lately! This was such an interesting video to watch. I've also been trying to shift my perspective on working out-- I'm trying to run more because I want to be strong and healthy and energetic, and I'm trying to leave my physical appearance completely out of my running goals. This is a great video and I really enjoyed hearing about your experience and perspective! (also, side note, I LOVE that lip color on you!!!)
I’m Japanese. I’m high school student and now have been studying English for the entrance examination for university school.Your English pronounce is very clearly for me and it’s useful for my study. I’m cheering for you!!
You are so genuine and I love your transition to an intentional being!!! ♥️ Thank you for sharing!
I significantly downsized how many people I follow on social media. I found myself just scrolling through my feed, not really paying attention to the posts. I now follow only people I want to keep up with, and it has actually had a bigger impact than I expected it to!
Ingrid, I’ve been loving your videos recently. It’s so nice when you get really real and honest. Please keep up the amazing work💕💕
In 2018 I left behind the belief that I’m “not a morning person” and started getting up at 5am to go to the gym and have breakfast and pamper myself in the mornings. Turns out I love it and I actually am a morning person and I was missing out all those years I thought I “needed” to stay up late and sleep until the last possible minute before rushing out the door.
who else gets excited when she uploadeds💓🙋🙋🙋







Btw I also make videos 
My goal this year is 10k💓
thanks for encouraging us all to think more critically about our habits, ingrid! ❤️
i let go of bottling up my feelings in 2018. i think from a young age, women (and men, hello toxic masculinity) are taught to put their feelings aside for fear of appearing weak or inconveniencing others. i had a big aha moment after a breakup in 2018 when i realized what a significant negative impact this habit has had on my relationships of all types. i’ve committed myself to expressing my feelings about the words or actions of those that i care about in order to avoid toxic resentment and passive aggression. it’s already served me well this year.
I love how thoughtful your content has been recently, it feels like a really comfortable space for reflection and I’ve really been enjoying it!
I’ve been watching you for so long and seeing your journey has been amazing. You’re such a wise soul! I’d love to see a q and a with a twist - old
Questions you have previously answered and have a different answer for now.
Thank you for being so vulnerable, Ingrid! In 2018, I started to let go of my fear of having really difficult conversations with people I love. I'm naturally someone who HATES conflict, and I used to think that one disagreement was a death sentence for a relationship. I'm slowly accepting that disagreements and difficult conversations are a natural part of relationships, and sometimes working through them can actually make your relationships stronger. <3
Thank you for sharing a deeper side of you today. It took a lot of courage❤️🙏
I'm 41 and finally let go of everyone else's drama, I mean this in a way that If something comes up in conversation about someone  or something that I know I always say something positive to revert the conversation
Please please make a video with tips on how to deal with social anxiety!! That was such a helpful introduction and I’d love for you to go into more depth
Heyyy Ingrid we miss you
Who agree with me
Hi Ingrid! i am never the type to comment on videos but i just felt spurred to do so when watching this. When I was younger, I was always subscribed to you but I have never felt more engaged and more connected to your content than I do now. 

I love how genuine and how well curated your videos are. I feel like I am talking to a long time friend or older sister haha

Anyways, thank you so much for the wonderful content as of late!! (of course, your content is always wonderful!)
oh girl do i need this
Learning not to beat myself up over friendships that were toxic and at the bottom of it, based on sexism. I used to think I should have done something more or I said the wrong thing, or I took things too personally  but sometimes people are not compatible in perspective or personality.
Ilysm , Ingrid! You have always been such an inspiration. Keep up the wonderful work!🤗💕
I totally see the value and wisdom of her point with the whole alcohol in social situations thing! I do just want to add that for some people, it actually really can be a good thing. I know there have been times where I’ve had the chance to connect deeper than ever before with a friend or colleague because we both were drinking a little and our inhibitions were lower. The self awareness she mentions when it comes to that is very important though- make sure you have a healthy relationship with the substance just generally use discretion and moderation. But also don’t feel like just because there was alcohol involved that the connection you were able to make was any less real or any less of a victory
In 2018, I realized that self-love is extremely important. Love is sometimes something you need to give yourself rather than expecting others to love you because how you treat yourself reflects on how others perceive you. For instance, I am trying not to use negative self talk as a conversation starter or in a lull of a conversation. Instead, I ask people more questions about their lives and when asked  about myself I don’t talk about what I can’t do/or I am bad at. Don’t get me wrong, I still admit when I am wrong and if I have faults, because I am still self aware. My saying of 2019 is “fake it until you make it” I will tell myself that I’m being my best self, then I will be my best self.
Love this Ingrid!
These videos are always so so inspirational! I love it
I’m still working on it but I’m letting go of negative self talk
A few years ago, I was living in my car. I had fallen victim to the idea that the pursuit of my “dreams” should take priority over everything else. Eventually I realized that that was foolish and began working full time while going to school full time. 2018 was filled with 7 day, 90 hour work weeks. I missed my anniversary, I worked through illness, put myself in the hospital, and became severely depressed. 2019 I made a commitment to peruse peace and made the decision to leave my job for more flexible, part time position. It’s terrifying, as I’m always afraid of ending back at square one, but it’s what is right for me right now.
Loving your calm energy 😌 This video is so great, because you seem so grounded. You really seem like you genuinely feel these things and enjoy the changes you’ve made 👏💛
i let go of...my job! it was a position i could no longer grow mentally or spiritually in, so i left. thanks for sharing your journey soul sister <3
I really really love your video for many years 
The part you mentioned in your social event and asking questions remind of what my therapist told me. \^.^/ 
And, I went to see therapy because I listened to your prodcast. 
Love you.
Proud of you Ingrid! I loved your article in R29 too <3
I’ve been starting to not drink at social events either, i rather be aware of my surroundings and be able to enjoy my night instead of ruining it lol.
I have ABSOLUTELY LOVED this video ❤️ I was so inspired by it, thank you for posting it! 😊
This is such a beautiful and honest video💖 Thank you so much for sharing💕
Your thoughts on conversations and setting intention with new introductions/conversations is do refreshing!  Definitely going to try this! Thank you as always for being so open 🙏❤️
I HIGHLY recommend the podcast called "Food Psych" for anyone that resonated with Ingrid's message about our thought processes in connection with food and body movement! This podcast discusses the repercussions of diet culture in American society, and it is VERY helpful in healing the relationship between mind/body/food! :D
'Outside of work, what do you care about?'...Love this question! This will definitely stick with me and I will for sure use this in future conversations! Great video! xx
In 2018, I stopped working with businesses that I didnt agree with their morals! Took awhile but I feel much better where I spend my $$.
I liked the video even before watching 😂only because you look so pretty and lovely 😊❤️😝
Great Video, Ingrid! I love how you are developing into a even more awesome person video by video. Been following you since years and it is just amazing<3
Hello Ingrid!
Great that in beauty industry someone(You🙏🕊❤) raise awareness about this! 
Spiritual awakening 🙏🕊❤
I LOVED what you said about being grounded in social situations. I've been thinking about that for a couple days and how I overthink everything I say and then feel embarrased afterwards. It's exhausting and it feels like I'm never happy after a social situation because of how much I think about everything I did or said. You put all those feelings into words and they make so much sense. Thank you. I hope I can become more confident about it in the near future. Hugs!! ❤
I had to let go of thinking/worrying about every single thing I eat... and that if I don't exercise one day its not going to hurt me. Now, I eat without thinking about what I'm eating and only exercise when I feel up to it or ready. I also let go hiding my true self and now I live my life without caring what others think of me, like my passion for the arts or being gay. Life is so much more better when you don't care what people think of you, or what you think of you. Thank you for this video, Ingrid. I've been watching you since 2010-2011. You are very inspiring. Thank you. :) <3
This was so positive and thoughtful Ingrid! Absolutely love your content ❤️
Girl!  I have been watching your channel for years and years, and I have to say, I LOVE how your content has changed, shifted, and become more thoughtful and responsible.  I feel like we're both on the same path and trajectory.

Thank you for using your platform responsibly and being a good role model.  Get it, girl! <3
This is probably my  favorite video you've ever made. I've been watching you since I was a teenager and now that I am in my mid-twenties, these concepts are the  kinds of things I am most interested in talking and thinking about. Thank you!
Girl, you have no idea of how much I relate to everything you're sharing. I really understand you. ❤️
I actually really liked this video! Thank you for sharing, Ingrid. The one thing I keep thinking of is getting over FOMO and truly savoring my alone time. I've become a bit of a recluse, but it truly feels good right now. And I'm not bummed or feeling like I missed out on anything either.
Oh my goodness, I can relate to this video soooo much. I am in the process of letting go those same exact habits, and I started that in the latter half of 2018. It's been a really eye opening experience. One habit I'd like to let go of in 2019 is not relying so heavily on technology to be my "pacifier." Thanks for continuing to make beautiful and meaningful content Ingrid!
Such a great video! For me, its definitely letting go of grudges.
I've been making a conscious effort to not have my guard up all of the time and to be more genuine with how I speak to people and how I'm feeling!
I am impressed by the way you look at life Ingrid.We should all be this mature..it would make our every day life better and more enjoyable!<3
yessss living for uplifting videos like these <3
This is wonderful and valuable. I have discovered in 2018 that it is ok not to always be working or stressing about tasks. That I can relax and enjoy time without having to be productive. Thank you for a wonderful video
this is a great video. lovely. i have been making similar changes recently :)
In 2018, I left the habit of doing everything by myself, to accept help or reach for it when I need it. I accept others into my life.
I let go of not doing things that i want to do because other people might judge me :)
Each one of these resonated with me personally! Thank you for sharing such thoughtful content
Love this. Progress, not perfection.
Thank you so much for talking about social anxiety! I feel like as we get older it's something that gets way less acceptable to talk about but it's something that I really struggle with - especially as more work-related events have come into my life.
I let go of people, jobs, ideas, that dont serve me positively or bring value to my life. I'm 26, and I feel like I've been slowly progressing, especially in the last year, into the person Im supposed to be 😊
I let go of Twitter, Instagram and Facebook consume so much of my time. Now when I'm with a friend or even just relaxing on my own, I turn off my phone and allow myself to be fully present in the moment. It has been life changing!
I've been a LONG time subscriber and I must say that in the last few months, you've produced some of the best content on your channel. I love how much more thoughtful and intentional you have become and your content really speaks for itself. 😌🙏🏻 

Thank you for this 💓
So relatable! Thanks for sharing your life with us ❤️
You have evolved and learned so much the last year! :* <3
I've let go of letting money be the source of my problems. I feel blessed for such a great support system who want nothing but the best for me. So now I'm motivated to excel in school for once in my life and get that graduate degree not only to make my loved ones proud but to feel like I really deserve it.
Thank you ingrid! this has been so helpful, especially when dealing with generalized anxiety.. social settings are very nerve-racking for me too. And I definitely can't drink alcohol to "calm nerves" b/c it makes me sick. Can't wait to see what you post next! <3
May your 2019 be filled with good health, wealth, happiness, and exciting opportunities!
I relate to all of this. It's good to keep learning to love things about yourself, and to continue learning from your "mistakes". One habit I've learned to let go is letting anxiety hold me back. I am now trying to recognise and be okay with it, and transforming it into excitement instead!
I'm doing dry January and going out has been really interesting.  I find that I am more present and less groggy on Sat/Sun mornings. However, by 9 o'clock, I get a little annoyed at everyone else's drunkenness. And I leave. 

I'm curious to know how you keep meaningful conversations going with people who are mostly likely having alcoholic beverages.
This is such an amazing video and you are building a beautiful community!
I let go of feeling like I have to keep in contact with people if they're negatively impacting my mebtal health. It was really hard, as we all feel like you just have to put up with family regardless of how they act. But in the end, I'm the only one who can take control of my mental health, so tgat was one thing I just had to let go of in order to give myself my best chance 💚
Ingrid. Love this video!!! 

I let go of: 
1. The idea that live was going to fall into my lap. 
2. The idea that I didn’t deserve to be healthy and love my body 
3. Buying new clothes (only thrifted) 
4. Binge drinking
I love seeing how other people are growing! And I love how intentional you are being in everything.
I gave up binge drinking and now rarely touch alcohol. It’s really cool to know you’re also facing social situations without a drink. It’s been five months for me now which I had thought was impossible. Not all my problems are solved, but it’s at least getting off the hamster wheel, and finding forward IS a direction open to me ❤️
I am in the process of letting go of my regrets from the past. It’s refreshing to be able to focus on what makes me happy in this current moment.
Your wisdom is so powerful😍
thank you so much ingrid, you are so helpful
Maybe it's not for 2018, but I started to stop (implicitly) asking for approvals from other people, like my family, friends, boss, etc last month.
Happy 30th year Ingrid.
I really enjoyed your perspective on engaging in social situations without alcohol. I too am an anxious person who often uses alcohol to feel more comfortable in those situations, I will certainly begin trying to go without it.
Really relatable video, thank you Ingrid. Would love to see another more in depth video about you discussing social situations (e.g. other strategies you have and some of your other experiences).
I've been working on being ok with things not being the super over the top fairy tale I wanted them to be but instead being more realistic so I can have better quality in what I do get. (specifically in my wedding planning and home searching)
Hi Ingrid, 

Thank you for sharing this amazing video. One thing I let go off in 2018 is living up to the idea that I had to always look like I knew the answer to everything. That it was okay to not have all the answers and that sometimes not knowing what to do can lead to great things.
I loved this - especially the idea of eliminating mindless shopping. Love your sweater!
Happy birthday, Ingrid!! Xo
hearing you talk about listening to learn more about others instead of worrying about yourself really encourages me to do the same. love you Ingrid 💞
Most of the time when I do shop I do ask myself "Do I need this or what can use it for".
I just did a video about letting go of fear. I find that fear is at the bottom of a lot of the things we are unwilling to let go of, whatever that may be. It keeps us from enjoying life. I also did a declutter of my bedroom and feel SO much better.
I am trying to reduce my shopping this year also. Hope it went well. Great talking from you. Feel same about shopping and workout especially.
Love this video. You are very wise. My life has changed so much in the past 5 years since getting MS. I have let go of sooooo much, all for the better & it is all helping in so many ways. 😉
Thank you Ingrid. This year I came to a realization with myself and want to just reach for who I am really am . I’m so glad you uploaded this because it had just help me with some more clarity on my journey.
Happy birthday! I love this kind of content from you. I've let go of the habit of self-destructive thoughts. <3
I love these types of videos from you, Ingrid! My 2018 had a lot of downs including the death of an immediate family member, and it made me feel like I needed to cling to whatever I felt was good in my life, even if it wasn't. But then I had a moment of realization where I was keeping a lot of physical things and people around me that were making my life a lot worse instead of helping me heal. Learning to let those things go and those friendships move on helped so much. Life lessons are so weird when they hit you out of nowhere, but they always seem to come at the perfect time.
These were great habits to let go of! Especially the part about not having a drink in a social setting. I know far too many 20 something-year-olds (my age) who are alcoholics because they use alcohol as a social lubricant. Many of them can't have a good time or good conversation sober because of how dependent they are on alcohol!  

I learned how to be better in social situations by giving up this idea that everyone in the room is looking at me. I dropped the habit of being hyperfocused on myself and started embracing the "what can I learn from this" mentality. Most people are not looking at you or judging you intensely....they are also just as worried about how you think of them. Instead of focusing on myself, I think "what could I learn from this stranger?" and "what stories do they have or knowledge can they pass on to me?" The hardest part is breaking the ice, but most people are very eager to talk about themselves and share things with you. I love the "outside of work what do you care about?" question!

I also dropped the habit of thinking "one day I will be confident." You can be confident any day...it really truly is all in your head and the only thing stopping you from believing that is yourself.
Very nice video 😉 I personnally let go of taking the majority of my decisions with my mind and reason and what I "should" or "should not do" and instead follow my heart and my intuition. Big life change that has transformed my life 😊
Thank you, Ingrid! Your videos are very calming and reassuring... it's like you are giving us all a hug and saying that it will all be OK! With all the social media telling us to do things, to buy things, to keep going, to try this and also that... you remind us that sometimes we don't need to do anything, we just need to have a break, to stop for a moment and think about what we really want and who we are
I also recognized that I was trying to fill a void within myself with "things."  This year I am working on "admiring not acquiring" and like you said only spending money on things I love.
It's been so lovely to witness you growing and changing over the years. Old Ingrid was also fab but I always finish your videos feeling comfortable with my own instincts and blissfully free of any angst that I need to buy something or look better on the outside.
I let go of watching youtubers that are vapid and brought nothing but drama and an icky feelings into my life. I now like to watch youtube videos that somehow better my life and help me grow as a person.
One of the things I really made an effort to stop doing was complaining to others about arguments in my relationship. I would find that often when I would recount things to others their opinions and perspectives would overshadow my own and if I had already moved on from the argument it would bring it up again. By doing this it's truly allowed me to rectify the issue with my SO and avoid having things resurface that were already dealt with.
You are killing it with the great content, Ingrid! <3 <3 <3
Ingrid dear, you are easily one of the most inspiring person in this world! ♥️
I loved the points you were making towards the end of the video - I'm TERRIBLE at conversations with new people.  Thanks for some tips!
You’ve become my favorite content creater in less than two videos... 😍
I love you and I'm so proud of you
Thank you for sharing something genuinely insightful and thought provoking. I have found many 'motivational' videos by majority of youtubers to be very generic - not inspiring or helping me contemplate on how to truly better my life. You are very in tune with your own self, and it truly does inspire me to better myself as well. :) Best.
I’ve been a long time subscriber and I have to say, you have matured so much! And I don’t say that in a bad way meaning you weren’t mature, but I’m loving your unique content. You’re so insightful! Do you recommend any books or activities that will help people “find themselves”? I guess, we all get so busy with our day to day activities that it’s hard to do that and sometimes have guidance is helpful. Thank you for creating such wonderful and thoughtful content! ❤️
Great video Ingrid. I too have stopped mindlessly shopping and my friends recognize the importance as well.
I really loved this video Ingrid❤
I would greatly appreciate if you would make a video specifically about how to talk to people and ask better questions.  You've touched on this topic in this video but I personally need a lot more help in his area.  Thank you!
Wow, what a role model you are for establishing coping mechanisms and not just giving into anxiety and fears. Thank you so much for sharing, this is inspiring!
I loved this video, Ingrid! I feel anxious in a lot of social situations and stress over what to say and whether or not I'm interesting enough or smart enough to hold my own in conversations. The mindset shifts and questions you shared in this video are wonderful, practical tips that I will definitely incorporate in my life. It gives me hope that although I cannot "cure" my anxiety, there are realistic things I can do to feel grounded and capable in stressful social situations.  Thanks so much for sharing!!
Another refreshing video. Thank you, Ingrid for your commitment to bringing us thoughtful videos that legitimately add value to our lives. For me, I am learning to let go of toxic relationships. About a year ago, I heard someone say, "You don't have to be friends with people you don't like." This was stunning to me and confusing. Despite that, it was attractive, so I explored that. After some soul searching and reflection, I made the decision to step away from several friendships. It was really hard. I celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend with a brunch with friends. As I sat there at the table and looked around I was so deeply humbled as I enjoyed the reward for my hard work. Each and every person there is someone who I feel one hundred percent relationally safe and supported with one hundred percent of the time. It was awesome and totally worth the work and discomfort. To anyone out there struggling with friends and debating on whether or not to let go and move on, I really encourage you to access your average mental health before and after spending time with that person. We all deserve to have friends that support and love us unconditionally.
would love to see a staple wardrobe video with different ways to style your go to pieces!
I've learn the same things as you!! I've learn to stop worrying all the time about what my friends think of me and other people. True friends will love you just the way you are. If the conversation doesn't come naturally, don't force yourself, just be yourself <3
What you said about social anxiety was so relatable and so helpful! I'm definitely going to think of those things the next time I'm in a new social situation. :) Something I left behind in 2018 was eating unhealthily and eating desserts every weekend. I've embraced a much healthier lifestyle, which also includes working out regularly!
Similar to you I have learned to spend less frivolously and am saving more than I ever have in my life.
This video came at an exceptional time, Ingrid. Thank you! I hadn’t given this much thought, but after watching your video, you have inspired me to really think. Not about how I would look if I did something, but how I would feel. Not about how I would look after working out, but the accomplishment I would feel; not about how I would look after eating that comfort food, but how I would feel; not about how I would look when I stay firm in what I believe, but how been genuine and having integrity in myself would make me feel...
I love this concept.
In 2018, I was forced to stand up for myself a lot, even if it meant losing important people in my life. I used to be terrified of that. So in 2019, I’m leaving behind any guilt or bitterness that resulted after I stood up for myself. I don’t have to try and mend those friendships. I know in my core being and soul that I did what was right for me. I don’t have to feel bad about cutting out people who actively stood against me or feel bitter that they did so anymore. I’m leaving them behind, and I will no longer feel shameful about my decision. It feels SO good to write that out!
I also love these tips on sober conversing. This topic is something that I've been thinking about a lot in the last couple weeks and had a similar discussion with one of my best girlfriends last week. Thanks for sharing your tips, insights and your shift for more mindfulness! I'm trying to leave my insecurities controlling my actions in 2018.
Please stop that monotone eeeee at the end of each sentence. It’s really distracting.  😭
Does anyone know the name of the "Something Kitchen" channel or book she is referring to when talking about healthy approaches to exercise?  I would love to look into them further. :)
I absolutely love love love this video, and I think what you had to say in it was exactly what I needed to hear. You not only pointed out new things to me but you also reiterated the habit I told myself I was let go in 2018. I am just tired of constantly feeling sorry for myself because I wasn't born with what I think a "perfect body" is. Everybody is perfect, and the habit that I want to let go of is working out and eating health for vanity reasons. I want to take care of my body to simply just be healthy, because being motivated by vanity reasons is not healthy for your mind.

 Ingrid, thank you for the raw and inspiring content you have been creating. I can't wait to be further inspired by you, and what you have to say, in the future. Keep being 100% you!
Hi Ingrid! I think this video is something I needed to hear today. I had a quick question and possible video request, but how do you build good habits? I know you spoke about letting go over habits you didn't want to keep but I was curious to how you motivate and keep yourself on track with developing new beneficial habits.
Love love love this! Thank you!
PLEASE STOP MAKING VIDEOS! YOURE EXTREMELY IRRELEVANT AND WONT EVEN MAKE ANY REAL TALK VIDEOS. JUST AFTER SPONSORS ALWAYS
I no longer worry about having an important job that has alot of money attached to it. My energy goes into new experiences and being a great foster mom with a lovely animal rescue.
In 2018 I realized that for years, I had been subconsciously taking on responsibility for my friends' feelings...I have always been a good listener and I love when my friends open up to me. But whether positive or negative, I was letting the ups and downs of their lives consume me to a point of mental anguish unlike anything I had ever experienced in a friendship. So I took a big step back and committed myself to staying at a distance when I knew that the things they were sharing with me might be too much for me to handle. And I changed the way I responded to those friends, remaining compassionate but without allowing their situations to weigh so heavily on me. I found the balance between separating myself from their problems and still being supportive when they needed me. In one case it resulted in the end of a close friendship that had lasted for 8 years (which was heartbreaking but necessary), and in other cases I've made existing friendships much stronger and healthier! Others' burdens are not mine to bear.
I just want to say: Thank you <3
I've recently started watching your videos again because I feel that our values and morals have realigned 😊 I loved everything you shared in this video and really appreciate your mindfulness and kindheartedness. I really feel like you are speaking directly to me when you say certain things
buying shitloads of skincare. I want to use up all the things I already own first.
I too have let go of drinking alcohol (entirely; not just in social situations). It started with me choosing to take a step back since I noticed that once my fitness has weakened, drinking somehow made how I felt worse. Then I noticed that other than the occasional drink after a long day was no longer taking the edge off, and what remained was drinking for "the social side of it." Figured if some people who i choose to hang out with Need  a drink In Order to relax with friends, then maybe it isn't for me, and if they are true friends, they'll want to hang out or keep in touch without the necessity of the buffer of a drink or so. Also started to date a Muslim who asked me to stop drinking alcohol past a certain point in our relationship. My initial thought was to push back and pick up drinking again, but eventually I tapered off to no alcohol whatsoever. I must say that I am much more comfortable with myself and my surroundings because of all this.

Next, I would like to stop smoking cigarettes for similar reasons and of course the health aspects.

I loved this video because it aided me to think it's okay to go your own way and not compromise for others. I have always been into personal growth, and listening to one's evolving needs. And dropping things aren't always a miss, but rather an opportunity to realize what else is out there for self fulfillment and discarding whatever doesn't serve me any longer.  

The current update is that, looking back, I have been able to unconsciously replace has-beens with things that are enjoyable and fulfilling.
I am more fit now through other enjoyable. Also, while I do still have friends, socialization is not in my list of priorities right now, and I am at peace with that. 

And I plan to continue to replace as I find fit for the moment.
I’ve let go of doing everything to please my family. As a senior in high school there is so much pressure to be what your parents want and I’ve spent most of my life trying to do that. My mom has a plan for me and it isn’t me. She actually passed away in December and it broke my heart. I’ve done so much reflecting and this finally allowed me to truly be myself because I know that she’ll be proud of me no matter what. I felt like I had to go to college, but after talking to my dad I came to the conclusion that I’m not ready. It’s not the path I want to go down yet. Now, I’m doing a teaching program in Thailand and Vietnam from June to February. Thank you for this beautiful video Ingrid! Inspiring as always!
I wish I wasn’t so scared and and self conscious and had such low self esteem. I wish I started sooner on my journey to self love. All those nights I spent in my room crying about how I looked, I wasted my time and youth being upset about not being or looking good enough. I wish lost weight. It would’ve help my confidence. I would’ve spent less time worrying about how I look. I’m still very young but I regret so much. I wish I would’ve told myself to hold the people I love closer. 
I have so much to say.
Hey Ingrid! Not sure if you'll see this but I have a question. Did you ever see a therapist or psychologist to help with your anxiety or did you just find these tools that help you on your own? I've had social anxiety all my life and now I'm 30 and trying to tackle this to live a more fulfilling life.
So I used to be terrified of conflict and of talking to new people, I'm an only child which isn't really something that lends to a lot of practice with social situations as a kid. 
I've started experimenting with different ways to get involved in other people's lives, and I even asked a friend in my class on a date. Steps in the right direction, I'd say.
I just love you Ingrid. I did the same thing this past year with the social anxiety. I “let go” of my insecurities surrounding making new friends and became more of a YES person when people invited me places. I ended up finding not one but two amazing groups of women to connect with.

I really enjoy your content. I always have. I’ve been a subscriber for a long long time! You’ve really grown to be someone I truly admire & I hope one day our paths cross.
I let go of negative thoughts: negative self-talk, envy and resentment.  I didn't know why I carried all that around when it doesn't serve me one bit!
ingrid this video is AMAZING and im coming to these realizations myself after confronting all of my childhood trauma. I just had a life changing experience at Kripalu, a yoga retreat in western MA and I think you would love it. I highly recommend. they touch on almost all of what you talked about in a community of like minded people. https://kripalu.org/
Something that I think I naturally let go of in the past year is the need to always be around people. I'm very much an extrovert and I've always put my self worth and value in what other people thought of me and how many people wanted to hang out with me. So, the habit I gained is learning to enjoy time by myself and being ok with not always being busy and surrounded by people. Thank you for this thoughtful, insightful video!
This is great! I completely agree about movement. It’s something I’ve been thinking a lot about recently and trying to restructure my thinking and intentions. I can’t find Caras Kitchen - am I looking up the right name/spelling? Thank you for sharing this video!
You’ve always been like a mentor to me, Ingrid. Even down to skincare. But this made me really want to think about the things that are important to me.  Thank you for offering really important perspective on things that most of us don’t think about. I appreciate you ❤️
Letting go of the idea that I am in complete control of everything
I love it your channel ♥♥
Ingrid, I would love for you to make a video focusing on ways you take care of yourself! This is something I struggle with daily, as I find myself constantly neglecting my own needs. I'd love to hear your advice :)
Letting go of anything that doesn't make me genuinely happy.
loved this ingrid ❤️
I let go of a toxic friendship. She was my best friend for several years but it got to the point where she was taking advantage of me. It was costing me a lot of my sanity trying to maintain the friendship while she kept hurting me over and over, so I just let it go. It sucked at first because she was my only close friend that lives in the same city as me, but it was the best decision and I'm getting better and building relationships with new people.
This was very enlightening. You're very well spoken!
I learnt to let go of doubting and hating myself for whatever went wrong in my 7-year relationship with my ex.
I totally agree that change is incremental and happens when you are patient and committed. In 2018 I let go of my dependence on other people to make me happy. I've been much more mindful of what things bring me joy and learning how to be more present in the moment and affirm that I am capable of doing what I need for myself. It's been a tough year and lesson to learn but I feel a lot better moving forward in 2019. Loving the thoughtful content, and really happy to hear how positive and mindful your 2018 was.
I totally need this💞
Oh I love your videos! It just keeps me going and leading to a right path. In 20128 i graduated and realized that life is more than a worry and overthinking. I am proud of me and through the year i read abour 50 books that helped me change the way I look at my life and listened a lot of podcasts. This year I decided to stop shopping because I am gratefull to be able to have what I have and be what I am but those material things sometimes get me boxed in a way that I feel pressured and that I have to have that to present myself better. So I am looking foward to this year and I know that it will be the best! Love you and your videos just keep that way! Lots of love from Croatia.
Ingrid I love listening to every thing you have to say ❤️
I let go of hurrying the process of healing. I have a lot of healing to do and I will get there. I hope
Happy 30th Birthday Ingrid.
Thank you, Ingrid! What an inspiring video. Your list mirrors mine in a lot of ways, probably bc I recently turned 30 and resolved to leave lots of habits in my 20s. Things like: accepting myself as a constant work in progress, challenging my self- judgmental voice, and being grateful for what my body can do instead of criticizing its parts and appearance. Thank you again, happy belated birthday, and keep shining that light! ☀️
I’ve also let go of mindless shopping. Instead of looking to shopping for comfort and rewarding myself with it constantly, I took up drawing and painting. I love letting my creative juices flow. It’s actually much more fulfilling and better for my finances. Haha 😀
The habit I've worked towards breaking is eating things that taste great but I know for a fact make me feel terrible
Sorry I have had to unsubscribe..no longer interests me unfortunately!
I’m letting go of feeling bad about not being able to do something. Whether it’s not feeling well enough to go to a social event, or workout... I’m focusing on allowing myself the space to heal. I loved this video and all of the thought put into your videos and life lately. Keep it up.
Love this ❤️❤️ 2018 was a weird year for me, but in 2019 I’m focusing on really getting to know myself better and stopping my habit of ignoring my emotions! I used to be SUPER emotional and in tune with myself but I’ve become so blocked off to what I’m feeling and experiencing. 2019 is going to be about feeling again.
yes THIS!!! moved to a new city recently and trying to make friends, so i completely get what you're saying about the awkward new conversations....
I let go of negative self talk and could see what a huge difference that made in just 2 months of working to be more encouraging and positive in how I speak to myself. If I wouldn't say it to my best friend I will no longer say it to myself. Huge mind shift there made a much bigger impact far sooner than I could have anticipated and has definitely put me on a better path :)
I love your videos about mindfulness. I think what I learned to let go of is staying in some sort of position because it's comfortable even though it's affecting you in a bad way.  I quit a job for the first time in my life, I really liked my job, but it affected my physical health constantly (preschoolers) to the point where being sick all the time was affecting my mental and emotional health. The director of the school was straight forward saying it'll take three school years to gain immunity to the germs and I just couldn't take the idea of feeling like that physically, mentally, and emotionally for that long.
I lost my dad in October 2018 (unexpectedly due to West Nile virus). He was my best friend. So, one thing that I noticed that changed about myself or my “habit” that I let go of was constant shopping. I wasn’t shopping everyday or anything like that. But like you mentioned in the video, I only starting to buy things that I really wanted. I began to transfer that energy to experiences and spending time with others. I’ve noticed myself less attached to material items and have parted ways with lots of my personal belongings that I hadn’t used or felt excited about anymore. Great video, Ingrid. :)
Hi Ingrid. I just want to say this - I've been watching your videos from the very beginning. Your audience might be smaller one nowadays, but you content is so important! It's something you should be very proud of.
I let go of letting other people define who I was, particularly my parents. I’m 25 and I was scared of branching out of my shell of who I made myself be for other people. It’s been absolutely freeing to let go of that person and actually be who I was inside on the outside
One habit i want to leave behind is over thinking. I have successfully achieved it 70% so far. I am trying to just go with the flow and not over think every situation. I always end up in a messed up mind state.
Ingrid, I have been following you for years now (I think the first video I've seen was with your roommate in college!) and I love to see your content changing to deeper topics. I want to let go of hiding my "real" self, my thoughts and personal beliefs and want to stop enduring things I don't like. This is not easy but I'll try:)
You should do a Jan favorites video for 2019☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
I needed to watch this
yes thank you.. Alcohol does not help Anxiety it HURTS!!! Alcohol is a depressant!!!!  I really really really wish ppl would see this. I see other Big youtubers talk about how bad their Anxiety  is and  then I see them drink. And I write comments telling them hey stop drinking it will help SOOOOO much but they continue drinking and they are actually making their anxiety WORSE in the long run ... So Thank you for this!!
Thank you for this video, Ingrid! It inspired me to take out my journal and make a list of habits to ditch that no longer serve me :) As always, you are an inspiration and a breath of fresh air. Something I am desperately trying to let go of is my negative self-talk... work in progress ;)
I am working very diligently on no longer taking on the roll of being the “fixer”. It is no longer my “job” to try to make everyone in my life happy. People must work on the own stuff and commit to their own changes.  I have stopped taking on the sadness of other people. I can empathize and offer quiet comfort, but, I no longer allow their moods to impact mine negatively.
So happy to watch this :) I feel like 2018 was the year when I realized I had to let go of things I can't change. 2019 has been about implementing these changes, but also not punishing myself (to use your phrase) when I fall short.


One thing that's helped has been improv. I've been taking classes since last July, and it's helped me feel better about the awkward moments because you'll find the fun part of a scene. Improv has helped me ignore the thoughts vying for my attention and focus on what's important. It's also helped me find something I love doing :)
These are the videos I love!
Hi Ingrid! I loved this video idea so much! In 2018, I stopped biting my nails. Now, that might seem like a simple little thing at first, but to me, biting my nails symbolizes my anxiety, and a coping mechanism for stress and nervousness that I had had for over ten years. Thank you so much for sharing these things with us, your voice and thoughts are so powerful and loaded with wisdom, I deeply enjoy watching your videos, every day more and more. Sending love from Argentina!
I love this video Ingrid! Something I've left behind in 2018 is people pleasing and it feels really good. I pretty much stopped this towards the last half of 2018 and I'm feeling much happier about my life!
It is definitely a work in progress, but this year i want to let go of negativity. I want to try not to get myself involved in drama and most of the time it isnt even mine to begin with. I want to get back to being the happy person I used to be because i lost myself somewhere along the way.
This was a really great video!! - Keep the mindless shopping in mind when you're promoting sponsored products i.e. things we don't really need, but brands are paying you to "influence" us to buy it. I understand it's part of your job, but just keep that in mind.
I love what you said about drinking in social situations. I had very similar thoughts lately. Where I come from it's always frowned upon when you drink alone, but I do enjoy a nice glass of wine after a very hectic day. On the other hand it's absolutely accepted to drink a ton as soon as there's people around. But I had so many situations in the last months where I drank on social occasions and afterwards felt ashamed for things I'd said and such. So for my birthday party this year I bought non-alcoholic beverages for myself that still were kinda festive. And I had the best night. Also I could see how the people that were drinking were making a fool of themselves as the night progressed...That was quite eye-opening.
Preach girl!
Thanks for sharing this, Ingrid! In 2018 I let go of shying away from things where there’s a hard conversation in between where you are and where you want to/think you deserve to be, specifically around money.
I really used to feel bad when people judged me, or someone said something mean.. I would dwell upon it and be miserable for days until recently I read this book called “Inner Engineering “ by Sadhguru. Happiness is within yourself, one should not give others the privilege of making you sad or happy, it’s you who has that power and only you decide what you want to be.. and 2019 has brought that insight in me, me and only me uses that knob to set where I want to be.
actively trying to not let change scare me
Hey Ingrid can you do a video about living in nyc with your puppy where he sleeps in the apartment, what parks you recommend in the city ? What food you feed him. Thanks
This year, I want to let go of being hard on myself, and I want to replace that habit with reassuring myself that I'm always doing the best that I can. Towards the end of last year, I stopped being so materialistic and instead turned towards spirituality during hard times. That was one of the best things that I have ever done for myself. Actually I think it was Ingrid that informed me through another video about how extremely wasteful the fashion industry is. And as far as I'm concerned, buying the "next big thing" of ANYTHING never lead to long term happiness for me. Search for your happiness on the inside, not out 🙏💞
This was so helpful! Specifically on how you deal with anxiety in large social settings. I am so happy to hear your words on shifting your focus onto others as a solution to anxiety, but also as a way to just be more present and thoughtful. Last year was the first I’ve ever really understood that I deal with anxiety, so I’m going to use 2019 as my trial year to figure out what works best for me - meditation, openly talking about my anxiety when it hits, your method of focusing on others rather than myself, and just drinking water!! So far that’s my list of effective habits, but I’m excited to refine it!
I've been trying to let go of how I imagine things are going to be and how hard I try to make them the way I want when it is clearly not going to happen. This has been saving me a lot of stress. I'm also trying to let go of who I imagine myself to be, who I envisioned I would be and accept who I actually am. For example, I always imagined myself being in politics or activism but it mostly emotionally destroys me rather than ever being productive so I have to kind of let that go or find a way to transform how I participate. Instead of sharing my opinions on the internet or in a bar debate (which just upsets me in the end), I want to try to do more positive things, like donating money or I don't know what. I'm still figuring this all out though! Love your vids Ingrid :)
2018 was the year I let go of being walked all over at work. I'm speaking up when something is wrong. I'm speaking up when I see someone ELSE being walked all over. I'm speaking up when something doesn't make sense. It's a huge shift for me!
Hi Ingrid ! I realized I don't watch your videos anymore cause I preferred when there was no "talking to the camera during all the video"... Do you plan on doing videos like you did before ? More "scenes", more something else than you talking to the camera during 12 min... That's just my opinion but I needed to share it with you :)
I loved your advice on social situations! I’m gonna be using the outside of work question because I feel like it’s such a thoughtful question to ask without being awkward or prying. In 2018 and into 2019 I want to let go of drinking alcohol just because other people around me are. I’ve never been a big fan of drinking it’s never really been for me but I’ve found more and more that I feel pressured to drink if others are as well. Not that many people are pressuring me to drink, my closest friends are understanding but I want to let go of the idea that I need to be into drinking to seem normal. It’s okay to not be into drinking and you don’t need to have any other reasons other than you don’t want to to not drink. I’m 20 and everybody seems to be drinking around me and I just need to learn to be okay with not wanting to and being sure with my decisions
I loved this video! One thing that I want to let go of in 2019 is not feeling obligated to have someone tag along with me if I want to see a new movie or if I want to try a new restaurant. I want to try exploring certain experiences on my own and not rely on people so much for when I want to try something new :)
THANKS FOR SHARING THIS
I quit smoking. It's been 8 months and I don't even miss it. I don't crave it anymore
I totally get what you mean about exercise! Ive recently restarted going to the gym, and this time I totally changed my mental attitude to it. This time I enjoy it more and actually want to go rather than feeling likeI should go and feeling guilty when I dont.
Please let go of taking so slowly
I need to stop the mindless shopping... I want to invest in memories and experiences instead
Please tell me where the sweater is from?
I relate to the mindlessly shopping 😬
So helpful ❤️
In 2018 and still working on it in 2019 I have made a conscious effort to stop comparing myself to “super moms” on social media.  They seem to have it all together with the matching outfits, home made cookies and all of the extra curricular activities.  I never felt like I was doing enough until I had an ahah moment.  Instead of looking at what all these moms are doing on social media why don’t I get off social media and do something with/for my kids.  Simple but life changing.
I really appreciate this video because I’ve been going through a lot of rethinking and learning about myself lately.. one thing I chose to let go of in 2019 has been not feeling obliged to explain my decisions to everyone who asks.. in that way, to be unapologetically where I want to be in every moment. It’s been working out all right so far.. and has saved me a lot of time to do things that I enjoy :)
Who else thinks she is so underrated
I am letting go of fear. Fear of flaws, fear of doing things wrong (whatever wrong means), fear of not being good enough to even TRY something. I realized over the past few years how incredibly concerned I was to plan how to do things in the future. Most of the time I would not even start doing anything at all. Or I would literally force myself to do things with such perfection that it would literally give me anxiety. So instead of planning excessively and holding myself to unrealistic standards, I just try DO IT. I give it my best, I try things out, and I am not ashamed to fail. ❤️
lol so you didn't even drink and just decided to have full anxiety just for the thrill that's wild girl
I love watching your growth! What I let go of this year is assigning blame to anyone or anything besides myself for my thoughts, and thus, my feelings. Noone has the power of my mind but myself. This has been incredibly empowering for me. The podcast "Unfuck your brain" has been life-changing for me, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
Glad that you shifted your content, I know it's hard since you already had a following. I'm also being more conscious about what I consume and waste. Buying things can bring so much joy specially when influencers/media are perpetuating the mindset of consumerism. Eventually you realize that things turn into clutter and what's the joy of that? I have always felt guilty about not doing enough for nature so now I'm being proactive about it!
I no longer keep Instagram on my phone. So much time in 2018 was spend mindlessly scrolling, therefore after NYE I deleted the app and only go on every once in a while to see my friends posts. I went on a 2 week trip to Hawaii and only shared a picture because I was proud of the moment I captured, not because I wanted to brag about travelling... may sound ridiculous to say that aloud but I think a lot of us only (subconsciously) share to boast or appear good enough ... stepping back has enabled me to reset my viewpoint ...
Love this video!
Excellent, excellent video!!! I support everything you said. I had to leave the youtube beauty community because I developed a shopping addiction and always felt so horrible I couldn't afford a constant stream of new makeup, shoes, clothes, and $80 candles.  I actually felt like a failure because I wasn't keeping up. I found the self empowerment community and never looked back! I'm now training to be a licensed professional counselor and am so excited you are posting conscious content like this.  I am transforming my relationship to food this year. I'm super busy and really beat myself up for not eating perfectly all the time. That has got to change! Thanks again Ingrid!
🧐🧐
I have been watching your videos for a while now and I think we are so similar in many ways. All the things you mentioned in this video, I have also done or will do. When you were talking about exercise, I have also used it as punishment to look like someone else and I also been on many diets to be skinny and not gain weight. It made me mentally stressed that in October, I started listening to my body as to what it wanted and I now to exercise for fun. I mostly do workout classes and the instructor says that we have to workout before the holidays so we can eat the food, but I now just ignore her.  It is so freeing.
I will be 25 in two months and so many changes have been going on since the start of this new year. I went to NYC during Christmas time and I came back home a completely different person. I met this person up there that made me realize I was not really living the life I wanted or dreamed of. It was an eye opening experience and the change is awkward and uncomfortable but I know it’s part of this journey called life. I have decided to live a minimalistic life and it is a hard thing to do when you’re used  to shopping literally every weekend. I’m incorporating self-care, reading more books, journaling, drinking more water, and really trying to discover who I really am. Thank you Ingrid for allowing us to reflect on our thoughts with your good words of advice.    P.S. please start a podcast
3rd viewer!!
talk faster
Sorry I am learning English and I can't understand all things that she said. Anyone can help me. Did she said she needn't work out ? or she like working out or not ? Thank you so much ! <3
Any small you tubers  wanna be friends and support each other ??💕💕💕
Hey Ingrid
2018 is long over stop looking back and think forward.
This sounded so fake lol. Almost like she’s in denial.
You should send all your empty containers to www.terracycle.com where they’ll recycle it for you! I’ve learned that a lot of cosmetics containers don’t actually get recycled bc it’s made of mixed materials or not cleaned out properly so it just ends up in the landfill. For non-California residents you can drop it off at any Origins counter too! I do this all the time when I go to the mall.
The Ordinary has a Niacinamide and Zinc product that's only $5!!
A YouTube OG 🥰
Love this video! I am blown away at how many creams/serums you go through in a year! I've gone through maybe 2
Have you ever considered trying The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% instead of the Glossier serum? The active ingredients are identical and it is a lot cheaper.
How do you use up so many creams and essences in a year? I can use up 2 to 3 at most!
Yes I loved that you put prices! Please do a video or answer how do you know what products to put in the refrigerator and what's in yours?
How can you tell which skincare products work if you’re using so many?
Hi Ingrid, take a look at The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - 30ml! It’s only $6 and it may be as good as the serum you are already using but for WAAAAAAY cheaper!
I LOVED that you brought them to New York with you. I really appreciate that you do them annually rather than monthly because it's something I look forward to. Back when everyone was doing monthly empties I just didn't watch them. It's also really easy to tell what products are your favorites since you have multiples, especially with the Glossier Super Pure. I did just get the Simple Sleeping Cream since my face is so dry it overproduces oil and I am really loving it right now. I haven't tried it during the daytime yet, so thanks for the suggestion! I've been using the Differen for Oil Control, which is genuinely the most mattifying moisturizer I have ever used, but I'm definitely going to try the Simple during the day this weekend.
This is a lovely video and I absolutely love you as a youtuber but i think it would be lovely to see more low waste products or recyclable products! This really puts into perspective how much waste is produced through the beauty industry!
So many empties, thank you for giving a mini review on each item!!
Hey Ingrid! Great vid, I would love a little recap at the end or on insta stories about how many of each thing in a category you went through or separate them out before hand like all body lotions together, then serums/oil etc. Over all really enjoyed this though!
Jeez people give her a break, her youtube channel is a beauty and lifestyle channel, it’s her job to review products.
Just because she’s got a big following doesn’t mean she’s responsible for all of your actions. She’s one person and only human, she shouldn’t have to bear that weight and doesn’t deserve all this criticism. 
I agree; the entire human race should think about their actions when it comes to the use of plastic, but I bet all of us find it difficult to really stick to that ethos because the world revolves around capitalism and capitalism doesn’t care about the environment. Basically just don’t be so harsh. She has feelings too.
Not sure if there is a natural deodorant out there that truly excels at being an antiperspirant but Native is definitely, hands down, the best natural deodorant I've tried. Available online or at Target and the scents are great!
Can’t a lot of this be recycled though? Doesn’t all have to end up in a landfill. Great video, lots of ideas of new things to try!
You should try Cerave Moisturizing Cream in the tub for a face moisturizer. Save so much money and its way more effective than all the bs they put in serums and face products.
My sister gave me the Tacha water cream for christmas. I use it pretty much every day. The same with the hydrating spray.
I wonder what I'm doing wrong. I'm using my serums daily but I manage to use two a year maybe. Seven Glossier Super Pures? How? And it's the same size as my serum! How? What I'm doing wrong?
This is always so helpful for me.  It lets people know which products you go back to and it also shows which things didn’t stick with you.  
Schmidt’s is still the best for me.  I do best with the charcoal one.
when a girl spends 17 minutes going through her products and guys be like water and soap
Empties videos are my favorite
In this video: a million expensive things.
I’m surprised that the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizers aren’t in your empties. You seem to use them in most of your videos
Good natural anti-perspirant = Primal Pit Paste. IDK why more ppl haven't discovered it!
Thank you for putting all of the prices up with the product names ❤️!!! Nothing is worse that seeing your fave YouTuber talk about a product and instantly wanting it only to look it up and find that it’s one million dollars.
$3429+ in products (yes, i did try to add it all up, but probably missed a few things)
wow.
Omg so many empties!! You just made my day :)
Why don’t you try the The Ordinary Niacinamide+Zinc Serum instead of the Glossier? It‘s cheaper and it helped my skin a lot!:)
Liked how you included the prices, but would’ve liked it better if you collected the items before, got a bit repetitive but it also showed that you really like the products
The niacinamide serum by The Ordinary is waaaaay cheaper and works for my acne!
Dang. Usually I get a bit annoyed about how cosmetics and skincare are much cheaper in America, but dang Simple skincare is SO much more expensive in the US than the UK. those facewipes are about £3.99 or less in the UK (about $3).
I used the Glossier Super Pure as well and it really helped to clear up my skin but I switched to the Ordinary's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  product because it costs $5.90 for 30 mL! It works exactly the same as the Glossier product did for me.
I look forward to this video every year! You give off such a positive and calming energy that honestly makes me smile. So crazy to see how much one can go through in a year, now I'm curious what it would look like for me
Nice one 👍💖💕
If all Beauty gurus started watching Dr Dray.... 🤨🤔🙊🤦
Not to be critical, but how much product are you using? Maybe I am not using enough, but one tub of moisturizer takes me six/seven months to go through. Serum takes even longer.
The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1% is my favorite serum and I believe it works the same at the Glossier one. It is only cheaper and bigger. <3
I love these videos and find it disappointing to see how many people are commenting just about the plastic packaging she’s used. She doesn’t have anything to do with what the companies choose to package their products in and I don’t think she should have to choose what’s best for her skin based on a few brands out there that have more environmentally friendly packaging. All we can each do is our best and recycle and make good choices for ourselves but I don’t think anyone should be pointing out things in others to this extent... Take that energy and go tell the makers of your favorite products you are unhappy with all the plastic!
Y'all I'm pretty sure she paid more in skincare than I paid in rent this year so
It's insane how much skincare you go through in a year! It takes me over a year to use up ONE serum lol. No wonder your skin has been looking freaking amazing!
I just went through my empties of 2018:
- 3 Lush Ultrabland
- 2 Lush Angel on Bare Skin
- 1 Bottle of Jojoba Oil
- a few bottles of Shampoo
- a bottle Dr Bronners all purpose soap 
That‘s it! 🤗
Ilysm , Ingrid! Keep up the great work!🤗💕
You put the ounces... AND the price?!  You’re an angel 😍 love ya girl!
How many face creams, serums and oils can one person use up in a year?! I can´t wrap my head around the amount you used. I use a cream, a serum and a faceoil every day and I used up one oil, two serums and four tubes of face cream in one year. How can anyone put that much product on just one face???
Love your empties videos so much-- I've been anticipating it all month! I think empties videos are beauty "hauls" done right. We get to see what products you completely used and formed an opinion on, and you get to reflect upon your product usage and be more conscious when you shop in the upcoming year. My skincare routine is not too elaborate, and I don't get to buy many new products to test out, but I still think my year's empties pile would be big too! Anyone who watches your channel should know that you care about the environment and consumerism, and frankly I think it's pretty unfair to ask you to not use any products in plastic. 🤷 Because of you I've been trying to use up the products I have and only buy new products when I have a specific skincare need. Thanks Ingrid! 💖
I agree the IGK pink clay dry shampoo can be a little so-so, but the IGK First Class Detox Dry Shampoo is amazing! It's my "1 day too far" savior and it does add a good amount of texture while still being movable (sometimes texture + oil = helmet).
Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts on Moisturizing Bomb, Ingrid! 💕💕
You should really do a video differentiating between the moisturizers! 
So many of them, I don't even know where to begin.
this was amazing, @IngridNilsen. Thank you!
Did she get invisalign? No hate, just noticed that your teeth look different & I was wondering!
THANK YOU for putting the prices on here!
Has anyone seen the soap and glory shampoo ANYWHERE?? I tried it years ago from a discount bin, LOVED it, and never saw it again. I can see why- maybe it’s the last thing people would be looking at from a brand like that. But it was so good for my hair!
Love this video and we're so glad you enjoyed our masks! : )
Jimminy Christmas! 😻😻😻😻 how long did it take to film this video? Thank you for including prices with each product 🤙🏻🙌🏼
I love the Alaffia Coconut deodorant Lavender & Charcoal! Try it♥️❗️
Would love a skincare 101 video ☺️✌🏼⭐️🧖🏼‍♀️
Keep making all of these amazing videos! You’re one of my favourite youtubers ❤️ from Australia xx
Try The Ordinary, way better and cheaper than Glossier :)
Ingrid could you please make some video about tips how to handle anxiety? ☺ you used to make these types of videos where you also showed different clips e.g. of you driving etc. Thank you 💜
Can u please review the glossier super pure vs the ordinary zinc and niacinamide ? Love u lots 😻
I’ve finally developed a skincare routine and hair care routine. These videos are helpful to find products that I can purchase and use!😊
Loved this video including all the mini-reviews in between! 💜
I've been in the market for a good moisturizer lately. This may have helped.  Thanks, Ingrid!

hello products
Love your videos Ingrid!! I feel like were friends when your talking to me 😊 taking notes during this.... watch out bank account! 😂😂😂
i have been looking for a good natural/aluminum free deodorant for. the longest time. the one that ive found that works the best is the primal pit paste brand. only one that reduces my sweat and onion girl smell
New teeth?
Love all your videos Ingrid! You’ve made me feel so much more confident in trying to really help my skin, which is my goal for this year 🤞🏻 I was wondering if you’ve tried any of the Pixi beauty products or anything from Osea Malibu?
Loved the video thanx for sharing💖
Looked forward to this video since last year and was not disappointed! Why is it so satisfying to finish a product? Lol
yo, shouts out to the editor for this video 👏🏻great job
Oh, too much products... I got confused 🤷‍♀️
Soft and dry is a deoderant thats aluminim free and a clear gel. Protects your clothing and keeps sweat away 👍🏼 i found it at walmart
Love empties videos 💕 & I also love skincare!
Anyone ever watch these videos and feel the urge to go to Target/Sephora and try the products?
i look forward to this video every january from you lol
Your skincare products cost more than my wardrobe damn
I think I should try the Glossier serum, it’s clearly good!  :p
Try the Native deodorant it's Fantastic!!
OMG，I’ve been waiting for this ever since you said you moved all these from Ca to NY! Hahahaha 💜💜💜🤗🤗🤗 thanks girl
I like how you put the prices of everything on the screen.
Have you tried the ordinary niacinamide and zinc serum? I’m also addicted to the glossier one and I’m wondering if the ordinary one measures up
Could you do a video on your favorites from all these products??
Love this! & you! 💛
guys ingrid has said over and over and over again she doesn't like the ordinary niacinamide serum, just sayin!
Great editing to this video. Thanks for putting the product name on the screen.
Would you recommend the tatcha water cream or the essence? I can only splurge for one right now 😊 I already have the rice enzyme powder and I love love love it!
All of these products are quite diverse 
Sure it’s a lot, but most are moisturizers, which can be used often
Others are masks, which are one use only
Makeup wipes, makeup, soap, shampoo, hair products
They’re diverse and not that bad 
Yeesh 😓
Wow I have no idea how you got through all of those products in a year but I guess that’s why your skin is so much better than mine haha!
i was waiting for this! ♥ thanks ingrid
Ingrid!!!!!! This favorites video gave me life and will hurt my pockets bc there are so many things I want to give a try! 😁
Loved this video!! I would love to see the products that you didn’t finish bc they didn’t work for you video!
OMG that same thing happens to me with the belief cream?! I wonder why?
I LOVE your empties videos! They're the only ones I enjoy watching to the end - quick reviews and honest feedback :) Please do it again for 2019!
you should try out the ordinary niacinamide serum! it’s the same ingredients as the glossier one but literally 5$!! it’s my fav
Certain Dri roll-on. It' s not organic and so on, it's rather opposite. But it DOES work if you follow the instruction!  You just don't sweat. And you better follow or you will be in great discomfort!
I found nars eyelid primer through your video many, many years ago and its still the only one that works for me!
This is super cool, thanks Ingrid!
if i ever see another glossier super pure in my life i'll immidiately call out the death of capitalism or of myself
Milk and honeys deo keeps my sweat at bay!
For antiperspirants: I absolutely adore the Fresh Sugar deodorant/antiperspirant, as well as the Kiehl's superbly efficient antiperspirant/deodorant!
Did they discontinue Plumpify? I can't find it anywhere!
I myself have the same struggle but I would like know how you used up so many different kind of moisturizers. I mean I have several moisturizers on my cabinet at a time but sometimes I just feel safe to use one single moisturizer. How do you go through different moisturizers? Do you finish one and open another or do you switch between them everyday?
I always want to find the best moisturizer for my skin but then it takes quite some courage to try new things...
Hi Ingrid! Have you tried the ordinarys version of that glossier serum? Same ingridients for a fraction of the price!
Where do you get your Plumpify mascara? I can't find it anywhere in stores and it was my fave (because of you)! cries
is it weird to think about your body / skin absorbing a random cocktail of all those products in one year?
would recommend The Ordinary's niacinamide/zinc serum--it's less than $10 and pretty much an exact dupe.
For an antiperspirant I like the Tom's brand, but you have to make sure you get the right one, some are just deodorants. I suggest the men's North Woods scent or the women's Coconut Lavender scent.
Have you tried the Belif Aqua Bomb? I think it’s as good, if not, better than the Tatcha Water Cream!
Your voice is soo soothing. Thank you.
Loved this video! U are so lovely <3
You went through so many moisturizers!!! ...now I feel like I’m probably not moisturizing enough.
Oh man it would drive me crazy to keep all those empty containers for a full year.
have you tried Myro deodorant? it’s a refillable, recyclable natural deodorant. Softer at room temp than I’m used to, but I’m sold! 💛
Ingrid! You should look into not using makeup wipes anymore or at least phasing them out. They really pile up in landfills and there are reusable options that work just as well!
Mitchum deodorant's are antiperspirant and smell AMAZING!
For antiperspirants, my favourite is Borotalco. It's really effective for me, since I'm a super sweater as well. It neutralizes any unpleasant smells and keeps my shirts dry! It also has a great, mild scent (I use the Original, cause I don't take strong smells too well, they make me feel nauseous).
Have you ever used any Aveda products? They have a large skin care line.
amazing video idea, loved it so much! x
The bumble and bumble dry shampoo was recommended by my hair dresser and recommended just using it once a month just to give it a good cleanse and follow with a moisturizing conditioner 😊
So many products! That's too bad you presented them at the beginning of new year, cause you can't say too much about all of them.
Do you even know what drug store price means?
This is the video I wait for every year!!
Is it weird that I get so excited to see your garbage? 😹
Love you, but the products you use are way too expensive for most of us! miss your videos using things that are more affordable and easy to find!
Love all your videos everytime. Ingrid, please make a video for people who want to visit NYC. What to do and where to spend or eat etc everything. I am from India and nyc has been on my list from long but for solo travelling it feels little stressful for me
I'm surprised by your experience with Monsieur Big....I have had mine for months and it's ahhhh-mazing. However it's not the waterproof formula
A really good antiperspirant is Certain Dri! I have always had such a big problem with sweating, like I wouldn't even be able to wear gray shirts ever. It's a roll on, and I use it every day after showering. I'll then use a deodorant over it just because Certain Dri is unscented. After a few weeks, I've found I can go a few days between using it too! 😊
All those products mean nothing for anti aging if you don't use sunscreen on a daily basis
I feel like I’m pretty good at doing my skincare routines but I don’t think I realized someone could have so many empties lol.. damn girl uses products like crazy
Just use a bentonite clay mask on your armpits and then switch to a completely zero waste diy deodorant! Your bodies natural chemistry will work with the deodorant and it should keep the sweat away :)
Weird. All of youtubers love Soap&Glory scent but I really dislike it. It smells like window washer sometimes :(
Wait! I was the one that commented on your “What’s In My Bathroom Cabinet” video and I TOTALLY got the Bare Minerals Eternalixir because you recommended it to me! 😱🤗 Haha you were right, it’s an amazing product... I love mixing a drop of it with my moisturizer in the morning and my skin looks extra healthy and luminous all day long because of it. So thank you again for the awesome recommendation 👌❤️
i live for this video every year!
Yayyyyyyy so excited for this 🙌🙌🙌🙌
LOVE these videos! Watched with my best girlfriends at a birthday sleepover while we did masks. I highly recommend the kopari deodorant. I didn’t like Smidts either.
I can tell you like Tacha 🤣 I’m tempted to try their stuff!
I actually read that oils really absorb the UV rays, so not good to use during the day :/
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
what fragrance did she mention?
Why am I watching someone’s trash at 3 am? 🤔
Hi lovely I was wondering what you think about the tatcha vitamin c serum versus the drunk elephant one? I’m nearly out of my current vitamin c and want to try a new one. I was wondering which one you like most? Xxxxx
Try looking on the ordinary for a comparable serum to the glossier. Way cheaper and larger bottle!
This really brought into perspective how much waste we create every year. I’m pretty certain I don’t use that much, but who actually knows 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

A really cool bit of information that I saw on Facebook is that wildlife rescues apparently can use washed mascara wands to help with medical care and cleaning of wildlife animals.

The address is:

One of my favorite videos
Lafes deodorant is really good, found at Whole Foods
I know it was probably just a typo, but the Schmidt’s deodorant is actually around $7-10, not $38. Just letting people know so they don’t write it off as too expensive lol. Great empties, I love your empties videos, they’re so satisfying 😍😍😍
Try NATIVE deodorant-  you can get it online

There’s something different about your teeth?
Hiiiii I love youuuu
L'Occitane stores recycle all hair care/lotion bottles! Plus, you get 10% off when you bring things in to recycle. Origins counters (including at Macy's) will recycle all cosmetics packaging (lipstick tubes, mascara wands etc). Also, MAC and Lush take back containers from their own brand! Thank you for saying in the comments that you're thinking about the impact of plastic on our world -- I'm trying to do better, too!
Did anyone sum all the empties?
Hi Ingrid, do you prefer the tatcha essence or fresh kambucha essence?
Hi! What lipstick are you wearing here? I love it on you!
Love the Tatcha Water Cream
*ANYONE ELSE LOVE THESE VIDEOS?!
I really really like your videos.
Ingrid is HARDCORE into skincare and uses products religiously. Watch a skincare routine of hers if you’d like to see how many products she uses!
Obviously it’s very expensive and not for everyone, but clearly she uses them throughly and is not wasting them
IF YOU'RE SICK OF SEEING PACKAGING WASTE, DOWN VOTE THIS VIDEO AND ALL OTHER EMPTIES VIDEO'S TO SHOW IT'S NOT OKAY!!!!
Honest to god. I really like Ingrid, and her content. And the level of having shit together that she has. Is like through the roof. But am I the only one who feel almost step-ford wife-ish with her sometimes? Like she’s almost too perfect. Like intimidating, I have no idea why I feel that way. I really respect her, but feel like I could not talk to her because I feel like if I cuss, or say something out of place, she’s hate me. I know this is super off topic, and truly not meant as an insult at all but just that I have a love hate with her channel. Mostly just respect and intimidation, and fear. Lol. I have no idea why. I’m sorry I just had to get that off my chest. Please no one get mad, I’m really not trying to be rude. Just an observation
So many people commenting on how wasteful Ingrid's use of products are. It's literally her job to try out products! And if she's using them all up, I don't think it's wasteful. Plus, we don't know what she does with them after filming. For all we know she could take them all for recycling.
Holy cow you spend a crap ton of money on your face.... I can’t even afford half the products you have bought. 😳
Really wanna try the tatcha products now haha it also would be fun if you shared data like top used brand top used product etc!
Obsessed with this sweater
Kinda wish you would've showed us the empty jars w the lids off as you talked about it so we could see how deep the bottoms go, sometimes product jars are a lot more shallower than they appear.
Hi Ingrid, I absolutely  love all your videos, how you give qll the info in 2 sentences. You've mentioned antiperspirants, any luck in finding q good one. I've been using sport talc by Mennen for 15 years and never had any problems, but unfortunately it is discontinued. Tried almost each and every antiperspirant, ordered quite a few, read rewies, etc., nothing even close to thet one. Please, let me know if you find anything really good for NY humid summers. Thanks
Yessss!
* ask the audience
Ingrid, I love and trust your skincare advice so much. I can tell you're really educated and have made a point to learn about the subject for the sake of your skin. I have been avidly following your skincare routines since that two-part video you did eons ago in your bathroom with the BeFine scrub hahaha. I have a similar skin type to you and my winter skin is feeling so dry! I would love to see an updated video with the products you're currently using because it seems like you use quite a few steps! 😘😘😘
that’s a lot of plastic...
your budget is clearly large enough to afford products that are more eco-friendly, so i hope you will consider that this year. the planet needs beauty influencers like you to show the products that are good for it.
Think I will try a few!
What’s up with her teeth?
I use the Schmidt’s deodorant in the jar. Works way better than the stick.
I like her blush. Do anybody knows what blush is she using here?
Too much plastic!! Too many face wipes and sheet masks going into our land fills. I recently discovered no waste products they're life changing. Face cloths, reusable cotton rounds shampoo bars, diy deoderant etc. I love that she sticks up for women's rights, I'd like to see her stick up for the environment too.
I love watching these videos each year!
Take your empties to Credo so that they can have them recycled properly and you can earn points! I promise you’ll fall in love with that clean beauty mecca!
Loveeeee tatcha
holy crap how
Total: $3496.53, yikes
Ingrid, have you tried Laneige instead of Tatcha? Trying to understand why the water cream feels so "worth it"??
💍💍💍💍
ingrid's born on my bday!!!! Feb 2!!!
i think this video shows why your views are down (i liked it though). i know, you matured a lot. i've been watching you since 2012, where you used far more available products, drugstore, affordable. we saw outfit videos and tags. i know, youtube has changed, you have, too, but i kinda think a lot of us miss -not the old ingrid - but what we loved about the channel, the relatability and inspiration. lots of love, dear.
I'm obsessed with your empties I always get excited when you post. You have inspired me to do empties on my channl
Great video!
I saw the price of the Tatcha sheet masks, $95 for 20, and I got really excited! However when I checked the website it’s actually $95 for 4 ☹️ Might want to fix that typo!!
If you want to look into a niacinamide and zinc serum that's a lot cheaper, and actually a more pure quality than the Glossier Super Pure, look into The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc serum! I found it to be so much more effective than the Glossier one!
Consumerism at its finest.
Hi Ingrid!❤️
to all those girly girls out there I think you might like my YouTube channel
I really think you’re going to look back at this in horror in a couple years. Idk I’m just really surprised to see you buy into consumerism this much. It’s so materialistic and wasteful. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with buying nice products and treating yourself every now and then but this is on a whole different level. I’ve followed you for years and years and I’ve seen how much you’ve changed over the years (for the good!) but it’s obvious you still have some work to do (don’t we all?!) I just thought you were living a bit more minimalistic than this. Idk I guess I just expected more from you. I know you’re always working on yourself and no ones perfect. You’re usually just so mindful and self aware. I guess this is a blind spot for you. I challenge you to be more mindful about what you buy this year.
2912 dollars 💸
Ingrid i love youuùu
How on earth are you getting through that many products in just ONE year??? Seems very wasteful to me, especially considering all of that plastic packaging.
This comment section is toxic, no pun intended.
Not only is the amount of products you use so excessive, the cost and waste produced from all of this is so not worth it.  I can’t imagine needing this much stuff but you do you.
Hey Ingrid
3k for skin care and bunch of plastic 🤦🏻‍♀️
Complains about paying $30 for .5 oz, but pays $55 for 1oz... 

How do you go through so much per year??? Holy hell
This will probably be lost in the comments but this is a really great opportunity to think about the amount of waste you’re producing. A lot of this packaging is not recyclable and will end up in a landfill. Please consider the environment with all your choices!
This is a lot of waste, didn’t you talk about sustainability in one of your videos? It would be nice if you promoted that more you definitely can afford it
How do you feel about becoming irrelevant?
Can you do a video about the benefits of short hair? When you just started, you had long hair, but your hair has gotten shorter over the years.
wow... so much plastic, waste and unnecessary packaging. it has seriously become just ‘spend spend spend’ with you. honestly, it makes me sick, ingrid... i have been following you for years because and have continued to do so because i always felt i could relate to you, but i don’t know how much longer i can. you truly don’t care about the earth and environment we live in, and it clearly shows. who seriously needs that much stuff? who seriously needs that much stuff for their skin ALONE!? if this is how much only you use, then imagine how much waste there must be all together with all the thousands of online ‘beauty gurus’ out there who make empties videos and promote excessive consumption such as this. you have such a huge following, so i can’t understand why you wouldn’t use this platform to inform your viewers about more eco-friendly and low-plastic products they could try. think of our planet. think of the animals. think outside the square. im sorry, but this is just downright greedy...
You only show expensive products!!!! Not cool
Love the video but please put music in the background!
I feel like your content has become a lot more genuine, personal, about growth and lifestyle. It's not as mainstream as before, and that's a good thing. We don't need more people to clickbait and fuel materialism, consumerism, etc (no shade though!) But what's popular isn't the best content at all, keep doing you!
I appreciate how transparent and genuine this video is - thank you for sharing such personal moments of your year, it feels really nice to see how much you trust your viewers with these intimate thoughts and feelings! I've been watching you for a few years now and I have to say that your content has always made me feel more at peace during times of confusion. Thank you for sharing your creative mind with us in this community, it's inspired me so much as a woman. I am really happy to see you challenging yourself and giving yourself room to grow. Thank you for inspiring so many people, Ingrid! I hope you can have a great year of reflection and growth this year. Also I hope that you and Erica have many more amazing, beautiful moments together <3 Love you!
I’ve been watching you for years, way way longer than I’ve been on YouTube. You’ve created things I’ve loved, things I didn’t feel strongly about, and things that annoyed me at times, much like a close friend can trigger all those feelings. But I have always, always believed that you are a kind, intelligent and strong person and I’ve loved seeing your growth. Even though we’re of similar ages, I feel that you are a role model for me. Thank you for speaking up about your hardships so candidly, you’re setting a great example for us all.
My word this year is “intention.” I’ve been really frustrated with life and 2018 was a really difficult year for me. So I am taking a page out of your book and choosing to do things with intention. I want to live life on my terms and choose everything with intention. From the small things to the big things, I want to live life and stop letting life live me. ❤️
I’m watching your videos since the beginning. I just wanna tell you you’re a beautiful person and I genuinely care for you. Thanks for jet again a pure and honest video. ❤️
I met Ingrid a few years ago and she’s just such a good role model. I started a makeup, style, haul, etc channel because when I met her she told me too! So Ingrid you rock and keep being you!
Ingrid thank you SO much for talking about the feeling of losing subscribers and your views being lower leading to feeling unlovable or not enough. I’m struggling with the exact same thing right now and it was so helpful to hear that someone I admire so much and have been following for like ten years feels the same way sometimes. We love and support you!!!
I love how calm and collected you are!!
Loved the video, I will admit I have been a subscriber for a 5+ years and over the last 2 years my viewing of your videos has gone down.  For me I have two modes of viewing.  One for the content, one for the person.  I think for me over the last few years your channel has got more niche.  You have moved away from the mainstream beauty to something more you.  The consequence is connecting to less people.  I now only select your videos when the title appeals to me, instead of viewing all content.  I don't think that is a bad thing, it is just a change.  But then my interests have changed from mainstream to more niche, I now know what I like.  And that is not always the same as everything you post.  Some of the videos I loved were your apartment decoration, apartment tours, declutters, morning, night, pamper routines.  But keep posting, keep being creative, and you will grow again I have no doubt.
Ingrid, I’m glad you can see the less views etc. as just a part of the whole journey as I sincerely want to thank you for sharing who you truly are with the world - it is inspirational. You’re not afraid to openly care which is unfortunately very rare and the way you live with intention and love is beautiful. I think I share these same traits but I’ve been scared to openly share them with others as it isn’t the norm but you’re inspiring me with every video regardless of the topic - thank you so much for your generosity and genuine heart. I hope 2019 is incredible for you x
Ingrid, or her staff, please can you think about interacting with your viewers. I have rarely seen you comment back etc on videos and that had always been disappointing
Haha a high should have been NOT pooping your pants while interviewing bill gates
I'm more interested in your new content than I was in your past. Although you may have lost followers, that doesn't mean you aren't gaining new ones that are more aligned with who you are now! Looking forward to what you create this year.. hoping to see more about career development, navigating opportunities and creative endeavors, and content related to women finding their ground and embracing it. Maybe a couple cooking videos too ;) I would also love to hear more about your relationship with Erica, I understand why you want to keep it private but she seems to have a ton of knowledge and strength (google!!) behind her that I know would be super inspiring. 

My intention in 2019 is to take more risks career wise and to stop doubting my worth and value.
I love the idea of a word of the year, and I think mine this year will be Strength. I want to work on my physical Strength, my emotional Strength. I want to use kindness and positivity as Strength. we can do this!
Hey Ingrid! I'm so happy for you and all that youve worked through in 2018! I love the word of the year concept and have adopted it this year as well. I used to do YouTube and gained a small amount of traction and then took time away when life got hard in 2017. Since then I've continuously wanted to start again, thought up new ideas, filmed videos, and never put them out. That has been frustrating for me! But at the end of last year I realized I wasn't creating with intention and when I was, I didn't do anything about it. SO my word of the year is release! To put into the world the things I dream up and want to see come to fruition. Happy 2019! Thanks for sharing your life <3
Nice one, love you 💖💖💕
10 years later, still my favourite youtuber <3
My word for 2019 would be “truth” which is the word of my  whole life, actually, but which represents the direction I want my inner self to take for this year.
I love how honest you are in this video but it's crazy to me that you can have 3.4 million subscribers and still feel irrelevant and like no one wants to watch you. That's insane to me. Social media is a crazy thing. You can't base your self worth on your numbers. I think maybe you've lost subscribers because you've changed so much since you first started YouTube (I think for the better! I mean I remember when you did a video on guy approved date outfits! 😂) and maybe your some of your subscribers haven't changed with you so they don't have as much in common anymore so they're choosing to watch other people instead. I think a lot of people our age aren't watching as much YouTube anymore and the younger crowd that is watching a lot of YouTube are watching people like Tana Mongeau and Emma Chamberlain. I have been with you since you were in college and wearing head to toe Abercrombie and I don't plan on going anywhere!
I really like the idea of a word of the year. 
I have always been a New Years resolution kinda of girl. But inevitably, I don’t follow through and feel like a failure. However, last year instead of resolutions I made just 1 goal...to read (or listen to an audiobook of) a biography of all the presidents of The United States. And I accomplished it! The sense of pride I had was life changing. So this year, I made goals to accomplish by the end of the year...for example, instead of “exercise daily and eat healthy”, I put “I will focus on my health (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual).” This way, as long as I’m doing SOMETHING each day to be better than I was the day before, I will feel like I’m succeeding. Instead of starting at the top where there’s no where to go but down, I’m starting at the bottom (where frankly I’ve lived for way too long) and moving forward each day toward a better, healthier, more satisfied and intentional me. 
My overarching idea for this year (now, thanks to you, my word of the year) is GROWTH. I’m 42, I have 2 sons, 3 daughters and one daughter-in-law (2 of whom I homeschool), a husband and aging, ailing parents that I help care for. This year, I intend to focus on growing into who I am meant to be. Not who I think others want me to be. 
Ingrid, I’ve watched you for many years...probably 8 or 9, and of all the Youtubers I follow, I get more inspiration from you and your content than any other. Thank you for putting yourself out there so people like me have someone to look up to. I appreciate you. 💕
Your videos are always so relaxing and enjoyable!! My word of the year for 2019 is growth, as I'm trying to focus on my mental health and to cultivate my passions
Do not stop with what you're doin coz ur content is always entertaining. Please make a travel vlog featuring The Philippines.
This is why I’ve been following you for so long! 🌻
Looking forward to seeing you create what you really enjoy in 2019. ❤️

My goal for this year is " Progress, not perfection. " 

My Mum is very sick and I know that I won't suddenly have a rocket up my arse and achieve all my goals this year, but I'd love to set the foundations and take baby steps towards them. :)
Watching this video I'm realizing I don't know much about your life at all... but I love hearing about it! I think people watch less when they feel a youtuber is too guarded with their viewers. Just food for thought. I loved this video! 💜
I don’t think Ingrid gets the credit she deserves on youtube. So proud of you!!!
Ingrid, I’ve been a follower for a very long time. I remember watching for your videos every single day. I have to admit that my viewing has been very selective as of late. I tried to think of why that may be to be constructive and helpful! I think it’s because I feel like you’re not as passionate about making the videos you have been or not truly enjoying yourself. That little moment after you went through your lows where you laughed and were acting goofy reminded me of your silly and wonderful self that I always remember seeing. I would say try not to put content out there just to get it out there. Make sure at the end of the day you’re producing videos that make you truly happy and excited to put on YouTube. You are so authentic as a person and I miss seeing YOU! I’m a huge mental health advocate and want you to be the happiest you can be. You deserve it! 😊❤️
Love this. I can totally relate to your story about your aunt. I went through a very similar situation with my uncle this year and hearing you talk about the emotions and feelings that come up after you loose someone, really hit home. Thanks so much for sharing and keep your head up ❤️
I really respect your raw honesty, it’s so refreshing to see someone so genuine. 
I don’t have a word for 2019, but I do have a quote to keep in mind: “Live less out of habit and more out of intent.” 🌱✨
My word this year is “development.” I want to develop healthy habits into my life by reading more, learning a new skill and honing my craft of choreography. Let’s go, 2019!
Hi, Ingrid. I actually subscribed back to you last year after a little break and appreciate your content very much. I love your honesty and authenticity. Keep up the good work :) My word for 2019 is going to be "discovery" since I am a bit lost at the moment. Lots of love from Slovakia :) <3
Hi Ingrid, I’m so sorry to hear how low you felt when losing views and subscribers. I don’t think it’s personal at all. I think you’re so intelligent and I love how much intention you pack into your life, it’s so inspiring. This was such a vulnerable video, thank you. I teared up when you did 💕 all the best for this year xx
I realised the other day I have been subscribed to this channel for 6-7 years. I find your most recent content just as lovely and if not more inspirational. As a long term subscriber your growth and journey has been wonderful to watch, keep going :)
ingrid, you're the unicorn of youtube influencers! to me, no one else is kind, genuine, and humble as you :') wishing you the best 2019!
My word is courage! I need to fight my anxiety. I'm getting my undergrad degree this spring, and next autumn I'm (hopefully) doing a student exchange in Central Europe.
Really enjoyed hearing you reflect on 2018, both the good and bad. Cheers to an even better 2019
No hate at all, but did she do something different with her teeth? I’m just curious. Great video, Ingrid. 😊
I love your videos, watching them makes me feel calm and relaxed. All the best to you in 2019!
Ingrid, I have been watching you since the beginning of your youtube journey and you have always been one of my favorite youtubers! It has been so amazing to watch your growth and I have learned so much from you and your videos. You seem so much happier and inspired to learn and the more I watch you, the more I fall in love with you. You make me smile and it makes me happy seeing you happy. Sending blessings for 2019!
This was great! I really appreciate you opening up and taking about all of this. My intention for 2019 is: Care. Care for myself, others and my space. ❤️
Just saw you (and Erica!- y'all are so cute) on the street in Chelsea and was reminded about how much I've enjoyed growing up watching you. thanks for always keeping it real :)
I think my word for 2019 is going to be “discovery”. It’s a year that I know is going to bring a lot of changes and investigation through the process. Thank you for an amazing reflection and down to earth video!
Just wanted to say, that you're one of the few people I still watch here on youtube. I feel like you've grown and that you're quite candid about your values and who you are as a person. This video was really nice, open and reminded me of why I enjoy your content so much.
my word for the year 2018 was "awareness" and it definitely was something that was in my head all year long. 
2019 my motto for you is: just do it. :)
Thank you so much for being so honest in sharing with us. You are such an inspiration and i can’t wait for you to conquer 2019 on and off this platform ❤️
it‘s such a blessing, that you share everything so open! ❤️Thank you!
Thank you for sharing. Thank you for being vulnerable. You inspire so many, including me. ❤
Have been watching your vids on and off for 6 years. Keep going and never stop! Youve got this!
This video was lovely, Ingrid! <3 Powerful lows and amazing highs! Keep going, you wonderful soul! <3
Love your videos!  My wife and I celebrate 13 years together and our baby boy will be one this year!  Love that you are such a public figure and out and proud!  Keep up the amazing work!
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS ❤️ my word for 2019 is confidence :)
Your vulnerability is both soothing and inspiring. Love it. 💕
And also: Our birthdays are on the exact same day, February 2nd! And I'm exactly ten years younger than you.  I can't believe time goes by so quickly.
Don't be discouraged by the drop in followers etc.! We're still here 😉
Love you, 
Anne 💋
Anne
Wow I've never been this early to a video

My word for 2019 will be communicate
I’m happy that you’re happy with your gf Ingrid. It warmed my heart to see you get so emotional about it. Queer woman of color unite!🏳️‍🌈💕
I also know that feeling of a healthy relationship, where you know that the love is real and genuine. I’m so happy for you Ingrid, ahhhhhh❤️
Thanks for letting us in on your reflection on 2018!  I really resonated with what you said about the feeling of being wrapped in love - you deserve it.  My word for 2019 is "surrender."  I spend so much time fighting reality, so I'm striving to find more ease through the act of surrender.  Thanks for posting such thoughtful content!
Thank you for this amazing video ❤️
You are so articulate and genuine, Ingrid. Please keep speaking your truth- it makes us feel so connected to you!! Much love xoxox
I loved listening to your year's experiences. I teared up when you talked about your partner. My word of the year is Breathe. I'm using it to center myself when I leave the presence of the moment; to come back to it and be here now.
I have loved watching you frow as a person and become who you want to be over the years. Your videos have had a huge positive impact on my own life and I am deeply thankful for that <3
This video is so refreshingly honest. Thank you. It really felt like I was chatting with a close friend
How you talk about your girlfriend is how I hope a partner talks about me someday. #goals 😍😭
My word of the year is “balance”. I want to achieve balance of mind, body, and spirit. My health has not been well and it’s important to me to get to a better place. I also want to work on balancing work and life. Thank you for sharing your word and this video 🙏🏼
I think my word of 2019 will be acceptance, to accept who I am, and accept things that have happened in the past particularly disagreements with family and be able to move on from them
My word for 2019 is Patience. 

Patience in looking for a better job after getting my degree and years of being underpaid and undervalued, patience in waiting out till I get my bonus and increment before I tender my notice. Patience in waiting for the boy to propose, and patience in starting my new projects.

It took me this long to finally watch this video. But better late than never :)
I have experienced a similar feeling lately, feeling not worthy, looked down upon, and not loved... Sometimes the world can just be so harsh on us. I have cried, I have lost sleep, and tried (and tried really hard) to be positive and focused on the things I love, the people that matter to me and be kind, mercilessly kind. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason, this is the life I am destined to experience and to make something beautiful out of it, which in turn will be my story. I am glad we are in this journey together :)
i'm so happy for you being in such a loving relationship <3
Loved hearing about your year, Ingrid! Thank you for sharing! Also, I didn't realize your birthday was Feb. 2nd! We have the same birthday!!!
It's always a pleasure to listen to you, Ingrid! Much love to you xx
I’m always a fan of you since 2011!!! I’ll forever support you and the content you make. It’s the trueness and vulnerability in you that I found very inspiring. Love you!!! ❤️
My word of 2019 is “nourish” - my body, my soul, my relationships ✨
love you as usual Ingrid <3 My intention word for New Year : shinyyyy
This might be cheesy but my one-word intention of word of the year is "intentional". I'm trying to live my life more deliberately. So far I think I'm doing a good job. 💕
I watch your videos for a long time and it’s incredible how your channel evolved, I’m so amazed how you did it and put some boundaries on your personal life. My word for 2019 is ‘fearless’.
Love your videos so much! Such an amazing role model ❤️
Im a new sub and i will say that i have really enjoyed your vlogs! I know vlogging isnt your favorite thing but i do enjoy those! Also, just your content in general is very soothing and i find that helpful in dealing with my anxiety and depression. Keep up the amazing work!
My word is achieve 
Thank you Ingrid!
I wouldn't usually watch these types of videos, but with you it's different! You speak your truth so eloquently and talk about things we can all relate to on some level. I've followed you for close to ten years now (wow! that's crazy!) and you have been such a sweet and comforting presence throughout that time. Thank you for creating content through the ups and downs, in followers and otherwise.
IVE NEVER BEEN SO EARLY!! love u :)
Hi Ingrid. Where did you get your grey sweater with the pink hearts from your last video? Long time subscriber! Love you!
It's so good and useful to reflect. :) I made a video of my Highs and Lows, as well. :3
You are so wonderful Ingrid! You have grown so much! I enjoy your lovely spirit! Thank you!!
this is such a beautiful concept. i think i'll be taking a page from your book and choosing the word commit for this year. i have a lot of personal and professional goals right now, and i've been struggling to remain motivated to take steps towards those goals because i'm kind of afraid of starting this new chapter in my life. but i'm going to commit and take those steps and be the best me i can be this year <3
My word for 2019 is abundance. This year I'm making a point to slowly ease my way out of finding happiness in the external, & commit to finding happiness from within. Anytime I begin looking for happiness outside of myself (i.e. SHOPPING), I begin repeating the word abundance in my mind, for true happiness cannot be found within the material but only within the self <3 sending light to all for 2019~
Ingrid I love you and your videos. My word for 2019 is "happiness" and "growth".
my high was when thank u, next dropped
my low was when this one dude curved me after talking for 2 months
Great video! My word this year is Accept !
You are by far my favourite Youtuber Ingrid! ❤️
2018, for me: saying goodbye
your content has changed so much since I started watching in 2013.  I don't watch your videos as much anymore but everyone changes and you're finding a new audience.  You'll be ok.
I love how after you said your lows you felt so relieved✨ me when this year ended, literally. Also so good that u acknowledged your highs and lows and decided to not give up on youtube. I feel like we need more ingrids on here right about now🙌🏽🙌🏽
So proud of the person you grew into Ingrid!

I love you.☺️💖✨

Congratulations on your ten years anniversary on youtube!🤗👏🌈💕✨

I'll keep looking forward to the inspiring contents you create in 2019 too!

Wish you a great and fulfilling year!👍🌸💖✨😄
i am so happy you found your person. you gave me chills when you were talking about love and that just gave me so much hope <3
hi, l get to know you from another  YouTuber, I think you are a beautiful girl😘
you are SO pure, love this!!!
oh and my word for 2019 is growth! ❤️
My word: Becoming! This is the year I graduate college, the year I’m leaving a full time position I’ve been miserable in, and the year I seek out peace. I want to become the person I’ve been working towards by stepping into the role I’ve established and worked towards and enjoy every moment of it.
I think I'll steal your word from 2018 and pick "commit". Thank you for sharing your wonderful growth. It's inspiring!
Congratulations on your 10th year with youtube. I've only been watching you for two years and I love your channel.
Thanks for this beautiful video Ingrid! My word for the year is passion
I think bring back sense of self 2019! such a cool idea and is so interactive in my opinion 😄
2018 was a rough one for me, 2019 has been real rough so far.
I am always rooting for you and love growing up along with you. Hahah I turned 29 this year!! So unreal. 🖤
I have a feeling 2019 has potential to be an AMAZING year! 
Yesss to listening to our deeper selves! 
I feel like my word for this year is: persevere ☺️
My word for 2019 is Thrive. There are so many things that I would like to accomplish this year and beyond. 2018 was a hard year for me and I lost a lot of my motivation. I want to thrive in certain areas of my life and be happy.
my word of 2019 is "persist". a lot of the goals i set for myself are potentially going to be really hard and take loads of effort to accomplish, but i don't want to let that stop me from persisting and achieving the goals i set for myself.
Congratulations on your one year anniversary! My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years and we’re still in the closet. Not that it bothers us but I wonder what it feels like being in love in the open.. ♥️
The line about you want it but you're not sure of you're going to get it. That's so relatable. :-) thanks for this video.
My word for 2019 is ‘Changeable’
Ingrid you are a beautiful soul. I loved this video. My word of the year is “commitment”
Ingrid I’ve been watching you since 2010 when I had just turned 18 and started university. It was a turbulent time in my life, academically, emotionally and both my relationships and mental health were in the worst state they had been in. When I faced a time with few people to turn to and having lost a lot of my zest for life, I found your videos and found a lot of solace in such a warm, kind person on my screen. You reignited my love of makeup and style and by starting to take care of my outside again, it helped me to take of the inside. I’ve kept watching since then and have grown through my 20s with you. Now approaching 27, you are one of the few creators I still watch and look forward to your videos. I listened to ladies who lunch on my commute to work and it made the Tube journeys go that little bit faster. I appreciate your style and grace, but above all your empathy and genuine compassion for others.

I’m not sure if you’ll see this, but you have had a profound impact on my life and thank you for continuing to be part of it. I’m very pleased to say I am the happiest I’ve ever been, in my dream career, with a fabulous group of girlfriends and wrapped up in the biggest love of my life. All the best for 2019 - L xx

P.s. almost forgot! My word of the year is thrive.
My word for 2019 is transformation, because I need it in every area of my life. I think your videos will help me with that. (--:
My word for 2019 is "balance"
I've been following you since 2014. I'm proud of the way you have grown and shown up in your one authentic way. Hugs!
I've been watching you for 8 years Ingrid and you truly feel like one of my friends :) I love how open you are and I will continue to watch no matter what content you create! So excited for you and your new chapter! (starting mine too - I move to New York City in a week ah!)
Oh I loved this! I've been subbed to you since 2012 and I feel as tho I've grown w u! 2018 was horrible. I was thrown under the bus by a coworker I thought was my friend, almost got fired, and had so many health issues come out of nowhere. So for 2019 im focusing on healing. Healing my relationships, and my mind, body, and soul. ✌🏽
If you want a tip, the reason why I unsubscribed is the lack of vulnerability. You're a good person, have great style and taste. But what I missed out is a connection to the real you. It feels like there is a facade between you and your audience. Share more things with us. Don't be so vague when you tell us stories. Either share the inside of your apartment or find another environment that you can share fully with us when making videos. The part where you spoke of your girlfriend is finally a little slice of realness. Please bring more of that to your videos. Less platitudes, more personal.
Hi Ingrid! I've been following you for a long long time, and I adore your content. It's so refreshing to see someone on youtube acknowledge the trajectory of their channel in a non-depressing way. Your word of the year thing reminds me a lot of the concept of yearly themes, which is something CGP Grey and Myke Hurley came up with in their podcast Cortex. I would highly recommend you give the yearly-themes related episodes a listen, as they are two people who are quite reflective and diligent about their lives, and it has helped me a lot when it comes to living an intentional, purposeful life. Love you to bits, so proud of you for everything!
I watch you all the time, you are a doll love you,you are always real, that’s why I watch YouTube videos to connect with people, and I think if everyone speaks their mind or is able to do so we will really change the 🌎 👏👏👏👏
Thank you so much for sharing your highs and lows of last year. I always appreciate how thoughtful and honest your content is. My word for the year is bravery. I hold myself back in a lot of ways because I’m afraid or things feel hard and I’m done with it. I want to show up, I want to be vulnerable, and give myself room to step into who I am, even if that means falling down along the way. 💛
Hi Ingrid, I don't often comment on videos, but I have to for this. When you mentioned you noticed your views had dropped and how that made you feel. I burst into tears as it was so relatable to me of how much we feel unloved and unappreciated when certain things change. However,  it is important to acknowledge that those feelings are not true. I have been following you for many years and I love you so much. Though I found myself not watching you as much I as I did before, whenever I have time to relax with watching Youtube videos, I often reach out to your channel and see what you are up to. I'm inspired by your creativity and who you are as a person. Keep doing what you love and remember you are loved and cared for. Love from Sydney <3
This was a beautiful video Ingrid ❤️ Especially the tribute to your aunt ❤️ Thank you for your bravery in talking about that experience. Love you and your channel ❤️
HAPPY... I just want to work on being happy
Ingrid, here's wishing you very healthy, successful and full of love 2019. God bless you and I really wish that all the negatives of 2018 stay away from you this year. ❤️
Thank you for just being you!! Your newer videos are my absolutely favorite of yours. I’ve grown up with you and it’s awesome to watch you grow too. ♥️
When you started to talk about you and Erica, I got teary too 💕
My word for 2019 is confidence :)
This is a beautiful video. Bravo Ingrid. You'll figure out your professional future, slowly and steadily, but also, change and decision making is perpetual so.. I guess enjoy the adventure :) congratulations for all what you have achieved.
By the way, my favourite videos this pas Year were the book related ones, the ones about the move, the ones about women's health and feminism, and your travel self-care essentials. 

<3
It’s normal sometimes not to always feel at your best, but we love you the way you are, you’re so sweet! keep going !!!
Thank you for this video! I really respect your vulnerability with the lows and sharing your highs! For 2019, I think my word’s going to be FIERCE.
Happy for you, making your dreams come true and finding true love. I just realized that Erica slightly resembles Linda Evangelista. You guys are a beautiful couple! xo - I'm going to use the word commit too. Thanks!
I LEGIT CRIED WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ERICA!
Love this I think my word will be focus. I need to focus more on health more on my business more and things that I want to do in my life.
Ingrid you are so loved and admired. You were my introduction to YouTube. I have been following you for years and you have given me so much.  I have gained so much confidence from watching your videos as I face life's challenges. You are loved by many people all over the world. You and many other amazing women helped me face leaving an abusive relationship and set out on my own. Standing on my own two feet. And your breast cancer series ment so much being a survivor myself. I love your word reflection.  Mine is peace. Just being at peace  and taking it one step at a time . Your an amazing woman. All the best to you and Erica. Many hugs 💕
Hello Ingrid, I just wanted to tell you, that I really enjoy your content, you have been creating the last months. Some years ago I enjoyed your haul videos, but turning 36 years (Feb 3rd by the way 😉), I appreciate everything you do now, much more. So thank you for that! 🙏🏼 All the best for you in 2019! My word is "growth". Regards from Germany! Love, Ingrid (yes, we share a name)
I LOVE LOVE LOVED this. So tremendously. Thank you for sharing yourself with us :) I feel like you're a good friend somehow without ever meeting you in person! <3
she's so genuine and pure, damn girl! an inspo for my channel <3
I always forget you're in the city now, but I get excited all over again each time I remember. Can't wait for the next time I see you. Gotta give you a great big hug!!
I just wanted to drop in & say that as someone who’s been following your journey for a long time, the care & effort you put into everything you do does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. So proud of you & all you do to help others. Lots of love!
your followers may have dropped, but your content has improved so much, to me it is so much more valuable and you have helped me SO much by opening up the past year, you have no idea - i feel like your real and personal moments and videos are just that much better
My word for 2019 is reconciliation. I  would like to spend this year really working on myself and reconciling with my past and understand that what's done is done and that I need to move forward in life. I want to spend this year really working through my mental health issues. I would also like to spend this year grieving and moving on from losing my father last year.
Been watching for years and you’re still one of my favourites. Love these honest videos. I really love January as a time for reflection. I think my word for 2019 is “grow”. It has a lot of different personal meanings to me, thanks for the inspiration! 💕
🖐🏻 you increased 1 new follower this year 
its me 😜
I am a subscriber and have loved your videos for a long time, so i mean this constructively. You say your job feels personal, but in a way your content stopped being personal. I'm sure you had your reasons to do so, but i think people sort of felt shut out compared to how much you let them in previously. This video to me is the first in a while (at least that I've watched) that felt open and honest, like chatting with a good friend. Looking forward to the content you continue to create! :)
:) :) :)  you've done so much for me. Thanks!!!
My word for the year is Joy. After having a couple of very difficult years, due to family illnesses, I feel the need to lift the cloud of sorrow off and bring more light and joy into my life.
HELLO, I'm new here! SO yeah, your channel is now one of the ones ill probably watch... so AYE you got a new follower
The people who are left watching are all of us who really love ya though! 😉☺️
Who else loves her videos 








Btw I also make videos
I'm your subscriber since 2012 and have never missed any of your videos. You have evolved and always tried to be a better version of yourself. You have inspired me a lot. Keep doing what you love and I'm trying to do so as well.
Been watching your videos for years, and I'm so happy of the YOU you have become and I'm so happy to see that you're in a good place, doing what you love. I especially respect your honesty when it comes to using social media. Love how you took time for yourself and as much as I love seeing your updates here and on Instagram, I'm really happy that you do you. Wish you all the best in 2019! <3
I'm obsessed with your jumper! It looks so cozy and delicious :)
My word for the year is courage.
You were the first YouTube beauty person I watched. My daughters showed me YouTube and the rest is history. I learned a lot and found some of my favorite products I got from watching you. Try some of the new drugstore products. I trust your opinion.
My word for 2019 is appreciate 😊
I’ve just decided to resign from work. I haven’t enjoyed it for a long time, but now I had enough. Though I don’t have a new one at the moment. I’m feeling extremely brave, and scared. But you are so inspiering and wise. ❤️ / Maria in Sweden
This was so spiritually honest and beautiful.. so happy for you Ingrid and you inspire me so much!
My word is consistence for 2019.
My word for 2019 is: Growth. I want to do things and surround myself with people that support that very thing in my life.
Hi Ingrid, I'm Ben and I'm French. Thank you so muuuuuch for helping me to improve my English level. I love you <3 <3 <3
Hi Ingrid! My word for the year is adventure. I definitely would like to just enjoy a bit more and put myself out there. I also feel like your content is changing and developing alongside you and it's great to witness! You're gonna have a great year!
Ingrid, you are always such an inspiration. Thank you!
I’m sorry to hear that you were dealing with those dark emotions and anxiety. Just know that you are one of my inspirations and I love watching your videos. You are wise beyond years. You feel like an older sister to me. I know others can relate. Love you, Ingrid, and happy new year!💜
Ingrid, I've been watching you probably since year 1 or 2 and I will say you have grown SO much in the last decade and I have grown up with you from middle school to college and now as a 20 something figuring out my way. I am so so proud of and i know it's hard sometimes but YOU should be proud of yourself. I hope you know that and I think where you are now is amazing. I don't know you personally but it really has been so wonderful to see your growth and now you're in my home city of NYC and can't wait to see what you have to give. Keep going and growing!
I have been subscribed to you since 2011 and seeing you grow over the years has been a joy. I wish you the best.
Ingrid, I love how honest this video is especially about your professional life. I’m one of the newer viewers, I think I started watching your videos around the time of your coming out video. I noticed there would sometimes be criticism of how you changed, which, as someone new, I couldn’t see. I’m saying this to tell you that you still come off relatable, calm, eloquent, kind — and human! It’s why I subscribed and stuck around so far. Keep it going!
Your video spreads love❤️
Always so drawn to your raw authenticity Ingrid. Sending you all the positive vibes for 2019. Thanks for sharing your high's and low's of 2018. xx
Really great reminder of your 2018 year. Wish you the best
My word is free. I want to free myself of the toxic burdens I struggled with in 2018 and to be free of the things that no longer be my joy. But also to be free to be who I want to be.
I've also been feeling really down about my work on social media this past year. I've been at the same subscriber count for about 6 months and my were very quickly declining. There were many times that I just broke down because I felt very similarly to you. It will get better Ingrid. We love you.
The bill gates story made me laugh out loud and empathize. As someone with chronic stomach issues it was nice to hear a story that i could relate to in ways and also find humor.
you are so beautiful and so amazing definitely a role model
Ingrid I love your videos, I think life shows us when we need to evolve and made a new start. This doesn't mean that you need to closed a chapter, you maybe just need to growth in a different way. Youtube has been a fount of different oportunities for so many, but it is not the only way to conect with your audience. I think  that youtube it is also getting repetitive and that it is maibe for a more ligth audience, but the audience that it is looking for a more deep content rarely look in to youtube, at least for getting that kind of information. You growthed and evolved a lot, in a good way, and I don't think that you are failing in youtube, I think that you are growing bigger than what this plattaform have to offer for you.
My high.... I got to travel to ncy. Low... I pooped my pants and panicked so got lost...nothing like honesty in a beautifully shit situation 💩
My commitment for 2019 is to love myself. So Love is the word.  And you are brave   It is hard to let yourself be vulnerable to be in a loving relationship
I am picking Creativity! For the word of 2019.
I can't believe it's been 10 years since you started making videos! I started watching your videos in 2010 and it has been so delightful to see all the ways you've grown, both as a person and a content creator. Your authenticity has always shined in your videos and it's been so wonderful to see someone I can relate to sharing their journey. So proud of all the stuff you've accomplished and can't wait to see what you do in the new year!
Thanks for sharing! Sorry you almost pooped your pants! <3
2019: COMPLETE Finish school, books, small projects, all the things that are milestones towards the next step in goals!
Omg Ingrid I never realised that we have the same birthday! I’ll be 23 on the 2nd of February ❤️
I may have to stay with your word, Committment. One main reason is because of my health issues. I need to make better decisions on food choices and need to commit to working out and moving around more.
Amazing video! My word is education. I am starting grad school after an almost 2 year break. I am excited to continue my journey in school and my career!
You’re my favorite YouTuber because of how genuine you are and I just love how you speak and express yourself freely. Do you think you would be able to do a video on how to express yourself freely and get your thoughts clear and organized so that one can voice them aloud?
LOVE this video babe!
Ingrid you are so inspiring in your vulnerability and I am beyond happy for you and Erica <3
been watching since the beginning Ingrid... love Love LOVE your authenticity! thank you for talking about things most people shy away from, you are bringing awareness and are a source of guidance especially to young girls out there! You keep doing you! 🙌🏻
This is the first time I try this. Since I've always had trouble with this, this year I want to, Commit as well. Commit ☺️
My word for 2019 is "let go". loved this video
Aww Ingrid, I love you! I've been with you from the beginning.  I watched every single one of your videos. You inspire me so much! I always love the way you carry yourself. Big hug from me to you. Take care.
My word of 2019 is «  Heal ». ❤️ love your channel and your authenticity.
I wish I could met you because I have the feeling that we could be best friends!! Thank you so much for sharing your life which makes me feel that I'm not the only one who go through all this things!
2018 was a rough one. A major burn-out, followed by the end of my relationship and moving out. But in December I got a new job and I just moved in my very own house with my dog. So my word for 2019 is gratefulness. 
Also, I love love love your videos and Instagram stories and posts. You always make me feel better when I'm having a hard day. So thank you for that. HAVE A GREAT YEAR PEOPLE
I loved this video so much Ingrid.
I absolutely love everything about this.
I hadn't thought about having a word of the year. I guess my word of the year is conscious. Whether that is being in the moment and less glued to my phone, what I'm eating or consumption of plastic and the effect that has on the world around me.
You are amazing. I’ve watched your videos from the beginning, when I was only 13 years old. I am now 23. You have inspired thousands of young women to follow their dreams. Thank you for being you, Ingrid. I love your content.
I have been watching your videos for years and years and love how you and your content have evolved! I feel like your videos are more honest, authentic and beautiful than ever and I‘m excited to see where you‘ll take us in the upcoming years!
My word of the year is self-love. <3
I LOVE the changes that you've made to your content over the past couple of years. It seems like you're making videos that are much more true to who you are, and are about topics that really interest you, rather than what you think should be popular. To me, it feels really genuine, and I have fallen back in love with all of your content after taking a break for a little bit, which is so nice - it feels like coming home! I hope that you're loving your own content as much as I am!! <3
Hey Ingrid! Thanks for this video. It’s crazy to hear you say that it’s been 10 years on YouTube for you - I’ve been watching your videos since about that time when you hadn’t even told us your real name yet (going by Cam) and you were answering questions on that platform I forget the name of.

You are still an inspirational person for me to this day and thanks for continuing to make videos! ❤️

With that being said, my word for 2019 is patience. Patience with myself, with others and with my career aspirations.
My word of 2019: flexibility. Moving through a period of anxiety and ED recovery (both of which inherently come with inflexibility), graduating with my PhD and moving to a new place for a career that I don’t even know yet, also turning 30, learning how to listen to myself and honor my intuition. Also, doing a lot more yoga and joyful movement. All those require different types of flexibility and I’m really aiming for that this year. 💜
Ingrid, you say such wise and thoughtful things in your videos. id love to see more self help/self improvement videos that focus on the mind and emotions and thoughts if you feel called to make them. i think many of us could benefit from your advice and deep thoughtfulness ❤❤
My word is patience. To be patient in others, in myself and the process.
My word for 2019 is mindful.  I want to be more mindful in all areas of my life.  From my health to my spending, I just want to be aware and purposeful.
So proud of you!
I had also actually chosen to have a word for 2019 this year, since I frequently felt that my resolutions were causing me more stress than motivation. My word for 2019 is BEAUTY. It might initially sound shallow, but it means a lot to me. Having been in a very dark place for the past couple of years, I noticed that one of the few times I was able to lift myself out of anxiety and depression was when I was appreciating beauty in some form, whether it be looking out over an ocean sunset or drinking from a from a dainty vintage teacup. In 2019, I want to be more purposeful and intentional about this form of self-care, seeking beauty to heal my soul. <3
My word for 2019 is connection. Connection to my body, my spirituality, my friends, my family, my community, my passions, etc
My word for 2019 is explore. I want to explore more of myself and my place in the world around me!
My word for 2019 is confront as I will be starting to look for a new job and I need to confront the fears I have of meeting new people and just to then take control of what I want to do with my life. Love the video Ingrid.
My word for 2019 is execution. These are almost make it or break it times for me in my life so i need to execute to hit my goals for the year.
Keep up the awesome work Ingrid! I’ve loved the way your videos have evolved and become so mature. You’ve spoken on some topics that could make people uncomfortable - but those that are willing to lean in to the discomfort will continue to support you in your work/life journey ❤️
I think viewers can move away for completely natural, not personal reasons.  Some of the people I’ve subscribed to have become so affluent that I can no longer relate or people have just simply grown and changed.  It’s natural.
my word is Luck, good luck specifically
I have been taking Ali Edward’s One Little Course for the last three years. I love the monthly prompts that it gives me. My word this year is begin.
Can you still do an apartment tour? Looks so beautiful:):)
C o n s i s t e n c y ⚡️
Actually I didn’t watch you for a long time, but now you are one of my favorite youtubers. I am gratefull that you are here, being honest and smart, helping me as well. Thank you so much. I often think that I am the only one dealing with stuff and feeling alone. But you are there for me (and everyone ofcourse haha)! Thank you!
my word for 2019 is experience. I've spent a lot of my life afraid to experience things because of judgement or uncertainty or unknowns, but this year all i want to do is experience life. maybe drink a little too much, kiss more people, dance too late into the night, take a risk at work, let myself love and be loved. i could not be more excited :)
You are SO lovable 💚💚
My word is “empathy”. Towards me and others.
I'm not crying you're crying! 😭
Gosh I’m so proud of you. I’ve followed you since 2010. I feel like I’ve grown up with you. So excited for your 10 year journey. You are still the most thoughtful genuine person I’ve continued to know here on YouTube.
Thank you for putting yourself out there in your video. It means a lot to hear how life has been for you in the last year, with all its ups and downs. My word of the year is “discover”. I feel I’m never done discovering and learning and it keeps me optimistic, even when I’m feeling cynical. 😊
You have always been known for ignoring comments
Now after soo much your videos and years of this channel, it is natural that you grow up and have this education for someone else, probably clients I believe, and it is okei... I have my own studio and also have good little youtube channel and lost my public, but have so much activity, new jobs and actions but not filming them... love you ❤️
My word for the year is Patience. It’s a challenge for me, my husband and I work in the same place and we just recently were married. As I entered into 2019, I wanted to reflect a peaceful soul and a joyful patient heart. 

Ingrid, You were my very first Youtuber that I ever subscribed too. Your channel and videos are unique and special, just like you are. Don’t loose heart, you’re still making a difference.
I've followed you since almost the very beginning. I'm about the same age as you and feel we've both grown together even though I've never met you. Last year was one of the worst of my life so far and really felt I lost myself. That's why my word of the year in 2019 is Focus. Can't wait for what's to come.
So happy for you❤️
I’ve been watching you for 9 years now (2010!!) and I love watching you grow into the inspiring person you are. I hope to run into you and Tayto in NYC someday. Thank you for being you, Ingrid 🖤
I had travellers diarrhea too after a trip to Mexico. I had no idea what it was at first. I had extreme pain for 12-24 hours before it hit. It was terrible and humbling for sure
I really like you and I respect you. I'm 22yo, so I'm much younger than you, but when I turn to your age, I wanna be a person like you. and I think I have some similarities with you. I like to take time for myself, I like to do something improving myself. and my dream is to live in NY!!! hehe
Now, I have many things I wanna change about myself. Sometimes I don't like myself. But your videos make me feel like I can change with my own effort and I can achieve who I wanna be.
Thank you for inspiring me, and I'm looking forward to other coming videos!
Oh Ingrid Bless you.  You continue to inspire and uplift all of us.  Thank you.   My word is commitment.   I've weathered some ups downs and all arounds....   but it's time for me to step up to the plate for me and my kids, and to start living , whether it be on a small way.  Take care and God bless
Great video! Thanks for sharing your experiences and feelings. ❤️
I've picked a word or words of the year for the last several years and it has been a wonderful way to go through the year. This year, I have two words. They are EXPAND and CONNECTION. If you would like to go even deeper, I can recommend the "Unravel Your Year" workbook by Susannah Conway. She's a British blogger and the workbook is completely free.
Enjoy your sunday! Love, Julia
i am so so so happy for you and Erica <3
Why WHY would you include diarrhoea?!
Don't be upset Ingrid! If anything many of your viewers (like me) are a similar age to you and suddenly find themselves more busy. I use to watch soooooo much YouTube but I've been planning my wedding and figuring out career stuff with family responsibilities so leisure time has cut down but I try to watch when I can!
My word for the year : bravery. 
I’m not the type of person who tasks risk. And I’m 24 years old. I don’t want to waste my youth being scared of what can go wrong and just be brave and go for it!
100% here for you. 100% here for this content.
Ingrid, you NEED to know! YouTube is such a better space with you here. This is coming from a long time viewer/follower who is sticking with you in 2019! You have inspired me in so many ways, I even mentioned a video of yours on my blog recently. As someone who is also looking to inspire others, my word for this year is content. <3
My word for 2019 is love xx
my word is love for this year.....thank you for the lovely videoooo
Excited to welcome you to the 30 club! Reflection is the most apropos word for this age. Though there are still plenty of obstacles and hardships I am personally facing, I’ve never been more reflective and at peace with who I am and truly understanding myself enough to know how to face these challenges with (less) fear than I’ve felt before. ❤️❤️❤️
Just keep making what you want to put out into the world. My advice as a viewer is to ignore the mainstream/ overdone ‘content trends’ that every influencer does. Its annoying. I really like how genuine you are and I think you should try and let go of subscriber counting, because im sure your hard work and awesome personality will stand the long road✨
My word is Balance, and I just wanted to say that, Ingrid, I absolutely love your channel and the content you produce. It brings me so much joy and comfort to see these videos. I have learned a lot from you, as I am sure others have as well. Thank you for being open and unapologetic with your videos; that is something that is quite rare to see in other youtubers and influencers. It is also so great to see you looking so happy and content with your life. It gives me a lot of motivation for improving and learning about myself. I am looking forward to the content you bring in 2019!!! Lots of love ♥️👏🏼☺️
Ingrid! I met you the other day at the Whitney. I was embarrassing and weird but I love you! I hope you have an amazing year. I’ll be here watching❤️
Remember that YouTube consumers that haven’t used their accounts in awhile are automatically unsubscribed from channels, so that could answer a lot. I really enjoyed hearing about your year and I’m so happy to see your growth!!! I’ve been a long time viewer and religiously listened to your and Cat’s podcast. You have helped me with so much and I’m really grateful for your videos!
My word for 2019: Growth
I am so so happy for you! You seem very content and that’s wonderful! My word of the year is ‘Powerful’ — I have lived my life in fear and trepidation that I couldn’t succeed. And that’s not what I want 2019 to be about.
my word is: fearless!
Hi! Love your videos
I think my word (Never done this before but this video made me want to do it now Thank You Ingrid!!) would be Change and Commit like your's was last year. So much has changed in my life and I have never experienced Change this much before. I want to workout and be healthy, change my mindset in a positive way, and just accepting things even though I wish that something didn't happen. Lol :) thank you Ingrid for sharing your highs and lows of 2018!! this really helped open up my mind a lot more.
Thank you again for your inspiration! I’ve decided that my phrase of the year is going to be “Let Go.” Let go of my fears, let go of my regrets, let go of over analyzing everything, let go of allowing myself true happiness. I hope that if I keep this phrase in the back of my mind, it will allow me to grow and be the best person, wife and mother that I was meant to be!
My word for 2019 is GO. In 2018 I was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure due to excessive emotional stress, weight, and lack of exercise. As you can imagine, I was pretty depressed, and wasn’t sure I even wanted to go on. One of my requirements for recovery was to go to cardiac rehab. While there, I met the most encouraging friend, who continued to tell me to keep going each time I wanted to quit. He pushed me further than I could have ever thought possible. In that time, I have lost 70 lbs, walked in my first 5K, and almost completely healed my heart. So my word for 2019 is GO, to remind me to keep going whenever I feel like quitting, to go after my dreams, because I have learned that great achievement comes from hard work. To GO means to leave situations and things that are not healthy or helpful to my well-being. GO means to Go For It! Live life to the fullest, Creating the life I want and need.
I thought the next video was going to be a year long empties :(
My 2019 word is integrity
My word is kindness. For myself and for all beings.
My word of the year is: Organize. The last two years of my life have been a whirlwind of grieving and gratitude, with a huge dash of opportunity. Only now that life has calmed down have I started to deal with the chaos left behind. I organically started around New Year’s, with a goal of having 75% done by the end of this year.  Each day I want to do something for: the mind, the body, and the soul, and oddly enough my first project - reducing the amount of clothes I have - does just that.
As someone who has just come back to your channel I can definitely say that my leaving wasn't because of you. I went through a very bad year (second half 2017 - halfway through 2018) and one of the ways I dealed with a my depression was to make my social media/youtube more compact. I only followed a couple of booktubers and stepped away from everyone else. Now that I'm feeling better, I'm slowly catching up with everyone. I know this may come across as incredibly selfish but that's just what I had to do. So sorry. I'm glad to be catching up with you. You seem to have changed things up quite a bit. Also very happy to find out you have a girlfriend now and are living in New York :) I'm so happy for you!!
As i was listening to you say share your word Challenge just screamed at me. An i think the reason for that is i have gotten quite comfortable with certain things in my life, my job mainly. An i need to challenge myself this year and take more risks. I need to try and if i fail embrace it. This will be a very challenging year, no bun intended😋
I love your sweater and pink lipstick look 🤗🤗🤗🤗
I think a reason for why you lose views and followers is that other youtubers are giving away everything and there is so much more drama with them, while you keep your private life private
Heal - that's my word of the year. I had cancer last year and now I want to heal. Not just my health, but my mind, my soul, my self confidence, my strength and to do things that are good for me. I always was willing to let myself be the one that suffered or the one that got hurt and now I'm going to take care of me and heal the little girl inside me and learn to be strong and become the best self I an be.
To live authentically
my word of the year is "begin." it is inspired by this video and also by a quote in amy poehler's Yes Please: "You do it because the doing of it is the thing. The doing is the thing. The talking and worrying and thinking is not the thing."
so this year, having just graduated from college, moved to a new city and started a new job, i will not choose to fret over my choices and my future. i will choose to BEGIN them.
I actually chose a word of the year a couple of weeks back as I got inspired by AmandaRachLee, specifically by one of the pages from her bullet journal. She didn't emphasise that page in any way (it was just a little quote she put there) but the idea of using a word to sum up what you want the year ahead of you be like spoke to me.
So I chose "kindness".
My anxiety and trust issues cause a wall to appear in front of me whenever there is a potential of me connecting to people. Because of that wall people often see me as arrogant and unapproachable. (it's just so easy to make a disgusted face when you're uncomfortable so they read it as "leave me alone". The real challenge is allowing yourself to be vulnerable and open.) I've been pushing away others for decades. I've been told to my face that I'm unlikable.
While I know I can't control people's perception of me and that you can't really be liked by everyone, I realised I want to do better and actually show others I don't hate their guts. I want to show them in reality I care about their feelings and problems very much.
So I've been trying to be kinder to those surrounding me. I've been smiling more and giving off some positive energy to those who might need it. I've been fiercely supporting my old friends and making room for new ones. To be honest, my world became a little bit brighter already because of that approach.
And I also have been trying to be kind to myself. That's even more difficult sometimes, but maybe it'll stick after a while? Who knows.
So yeah. 2019 is a year of kindness for me.
This reminds me of that girl with a zillion viewers and she left and did this same type of video. You should leave and go live your life in private. You seem like you struggle way too much.
I'm about your age (30) and have been following you since about 2011/12 and have grown with you. Your content now feels more mature and to me actually a lot more real than the videos from 7 years ago would feel to me now. So I think it's an age thing. What probably happened is, that you lost your teenage girl audience, because you just don't cater to that age group anymore. Also Youtube has become part of your job, so what we see here is your professional self, still you, but the professional side, while your private self is reserved for your friends and family... Just keep doing what you're doing <3 Meditate, do some exercise, not for fitness, but for mental clarity, go to therapy and just remind yourself that nothing external has the power to determine your self worth!
Hmmm.. I don't have a word for this year and I'm not sure if I will come up with one. But I suppose if I generalize what it is that my goals are for this year it would be ambition -but again not my word fty. But I am excited for this year because I feel like I have a clearer plan of where I want to take my life. And everything else I want to endeavor... It's exciting. :)
I've been watching you since you started (10 years ago!!!) We are the same age and I feel like I've grown up with you. Your channel this past year, more than ever, has been such a genuine and true reflection of the women you've grown to become. Your interests have grown and morphed as mine have, from makeup & beauty to issues like women's health and self acceptance/self care. I'm proud to have been a loyal subscriber all these years. Keep up the great work & the great content... I know the best is yet to come!
My new year's resolution is to be weird again. Adulthood is confusing, and I've tried to be "adulty". But along with that I've lost part of what makes me me. I want to be unapologetically  me this year. :)
First! :)
My word is: selfcare
I love the change in your videos - so much more down to earth and relatable and not just consumerism (which while not being a bad thing isnt the be all end all of the world).  I also love the word of the year idea, I think mine would be either change or preparedness this year.  Cause I'm getting married in December, my fiancee is graduating Vet Med School in May and just passed their boards, we are planning on moving (not far just to a better apartment) once they get a job - hoping for one very close to where we are now - but will definitely still be in this state!!!  And I'm working on doing better with keeping up the housework cause I had gotten sloppy and with really getting rid of and consolidating what I have because I know there are things in my dresser that I havent worn in years because I either  cant get to it or it doesnt fit or I just no longer like it, it doesnt fit my style anymore.
I love you!!!!!
Hi Ingrid, I'm pretty sure I've never commented on a video before, but I feel compelled to let you know of the impact you've had on me as a viewer. I've been following you since day one and it's been pretty cool to essentially grow up with you. I remember watching you in my early 20s and feeling so grateful that you spoke about your struggle with acne so openly as that was a huge challenge in my life at the time -- both physically and emotionally. When you showed your bare face with acne and scars, that was revolutionary to me at the time and had a profound impact on me. And now I'm 30, I've also been through some really hard times, but I'm out on the other side now and I'm a different person than I was -- I'm now married with a toddler and even though your life is very different from mine, somehow I feel like we've both transitioned into adults in a similar way -- I'm focused on self-growth and continuing to be introspective, accepting my anxiety and other mental health struggles, I'm combatting my perfectionist tendencies, and I'm embracing minimalism. I also steered away from beauty for a while to focus on loving and accepting myself as I am, but I've come back to it with a new lens recently, so I like how you sprinkle in skincare and beauty videos as well. Anyway, all this to say that I love the direction your channel has gone, and I'm really glad you aren't giving up despite the lower views. I truly appreciate you as such an authentic personality online. It's so strange to feel like I connect with someone I've never actually met, but alas here we are! So I hope you'll keep going in the direction that feels authentic to you because that really shines through. Thanks for all that you do <3
I feel like a lot has been happening for you the last couple of years Ingrid. You are very strong and you've kept going through all of it which is unbelievable. I'm not sure you realize this. Nonetheless, viewers can feel the shakiness and uncertainty just as much as you do.
I love your content Ingrid. I feel like I’ve been growing in a lot of ways over the last 5 years and your ch has always been here for my highs and lows. I have unfollowed pretty much all of the creators that didn’t suite my lifestyle anymore. I only wanted to keep content that was about quality not quantity, your Ch was at the top of my list. In my bullet journal my intent is to move forward. I spent a lot of time last year reflecting as healing and this year I felt ready to move forward and let the past just be in the past. So excited to see where life takes you this year! Cheers to 2018 and a fantastic 2019
Ok I am in love with this new Ingrid. Although your videos may not be as how you started, you yourself are changing and evolving and that’s absolutely okay. You are also at an age where you can inspire and touch so many people’s lives and I feel that you are realizing that! I’m so excited for you Ingrid!
Really love the idea of a word for the year, and I'm not much of an NY resolution person, but this idea really resonates with me. Decided that my word will be "FOCUS". Having taken a year off of school and being off now for 6 months with 6 more months to go, I think I have realized that getting myself to focus, whether thats on a task I'm doing or just the present moment when doing something mundane like driving or walking, actually makes me feel more whole, connected within myself, and just mentally better. I guess sort of like mindfulness, but in an everyday sort of way rather than a concerted time for meditation during the day? Anyways, thank you for sharing your reflections on your last year and this wonderful idea to set an intention for the coming year. "Focus" just feels right to me. :)
My word for 2019 is “believe”.  I picked this word because the thing I find myself struggling with lately is really believing in my own abilities and worth. In the past when something exciting happens, like landing the a job I want, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m somehow an imposter who got where I am on a fluke. I’m trying to stop cutting myself down with doubt and believe in my abilities to go after the life and opportunities that I want and believe that I achieved my goals because I AM capable, not because I somehow bamboozled someone else into thinking I’m capable.
Girl did you eat blueberries before you filmed this?...
When I thought about my word of the year, ‘change’ immediately popped into my head. I’m going to move in with my boyfriend (= change of house and town), and I’ve decided to look for another job. I’m unhappy with my current situation, and I’m gonna change this and turn my frown upside down! Let’s go 2019, I’m ready!
My word of the year is WORK. I want to remove the negativity I associate with this word.... I want to take pride in my intellect and give my goals a chance this year. I've always been petrified of failure so I don't think I'm living to my full potential. I just want to work towards something I can be proud of this year. It can be anything - fitness, art, my medical degree haha. I just feel like I haven't been working on anything recently just coasting through life....
My word of the year is gratefulness
YouTube isn’t a meritocracy. I feel like as you’ve been making more and more IMPORTANT content, you’re losing a lot of those “lowest common denominator” content consumers, and that’s totally ok. I love that you’re talking about things like sustainability, equality, mindfulness etc now, but lots of people just want to watch mindless trash.
My word is self-love)
Loved it ❤️
To be resilient
My word for this year is kindness. Being more kind to myself, when I mess up or lose my way. Being more kind to others, when they hurt me without malicious intent or when they let me down. Being more kind to the environment, by reducing my wasteful intake and increasing my recycling and reusing of materials.
Resilience is my year’s word motto.
You'll probably never see this comment, but just in case you do. . .I suffer from severe depression and sometimes when it's too bad to handle. I get on YouTube and I watch you. Your sweet spirit is so calming to me. You matter, Ingrid. I probably would not be here if you weren't.
Love this!
Growth!
❤️
Hey Ingrid, would love to see your morning and evening routines- those were some of my favorite videos in the past!
My word is "adventure"! I'm heading out on a 6 month internship in Vietnam at the end of February, and definitely want to be able to push myself out of my comfort zone and really delve into a new culture and context. To me "adventure" also embodies embracing the unknown and committing myself to being open to new experiences and opportunities, especially as once I return home I'll be looking for employment and new possibilities.
February 2nd is my sister’s birthday too 😊
Girl, I’ve been following since the beginning and my views have gone down a lot the past few years. We are about the same age so i have grown with you but I, like you, turning 30, with my own life changes. Hence, the less views. I moved to Hawaii, I got married and settled into a new stable job. I have grown into my own, just like you have and sometimes our likings align and sometimes they don’t (& that’s ok) and sometimes I’m just a busy adult doing adult things now. And I’m sure that’s the same for a lot of the viewers who have grown with you. We are just growing up but we still love you and are proud of you!
My word of the year is dream. For so long I have had to put my dreams aside and now I am paying attention to my dreams.
Rooted :)
My word for 2019 is believe. Believe in myself, believe in other people and believe in fate xo
Persistence!
To be honest a couple years back unsubscribed mostly because in all honesty, your videos, to me, have become a giant yawn. I did resubscribe this year because a few videos have intrigued me.. but even this video is a giant yawn :( I’m glad you found your highs and lows but.. this is tiring.
Hey Ingrid! I’m a long time viewer of yours and I’ve seen you go through so many ups and down and so much growth over the last ten years. I’m exactly 2 months older than you, so I just turned 30 and my word of the year is optimism. I have gone through some really hard times and this year, my goal is to look through the hard times to all the silver linings. Look at my struggles and see growth opportunities. 

Thank you for continuing to make videos. You’re the best!
Eloquence ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fearless!
❤️❤️❤️
Ilysm , Ingrid!🤗💕
Hapiness

Strive
Ingrid you are one of my favorite people. I’ve loved seeing how you’ve evolved and grown into your true and best self. Your content continually challenges me to think critically about my life. My word for this year is “Intentional”. I’m tired of watching time pass me by and not using it wisely. This does not mean I want to be busy all the time, but rather intentional of how I use it. The times I’ve felt most relaxed recently is when I intentionally allot myself time to focus on doing just that. I want to incorporate more mindfulness and intentional living in my dad to day
Patience
Balance
Your girlfriend she looks like Luke Cornard boo. HONESTLY!!!
My word is enjoy
change
Thrive
Consistency
Evolve
Consolidation
Mindful
Acceptance
Dedicate.
❤️💙💚💛💜❤️💙💚💛💜❤️💙💚💛💜❤️💙💚💛💜
I had not noticed any drop in subscribers, but I never look at those numbers!  I don't think your real followers ever think about that at all <3 If anything, I have REALLY enjoyed your videos this past year because they have been less "haul / sponsored / beauty" and more personal, more like... something I feel I could really get something out of! :) Thank you!
Hey Ingrid
Her teeth have become bad over the years 😶
?
Hey! The reason is you are losing followers because you are not providing good content. You need to have good content. People like you. They genuinely do. However the videos you are providing arent good enough. Thats the reason.
I’m sorry your channel is dying, I’ve followed you you’re entire journey but I really think you need to stop making generic videos, they have no substance
Not hating.... but you speak in monotone. There’s a sound you make at the end of sentences that can get annoying. This is your job so just some conservative criticism here..
Love the new graphics in the video! Can't wait to see what you have planned for this year ❤️
The new minimal graphics were just the cutest!!!! Really glad you had a nice holiday break!
Ingrid is so timeless , like remember her from miss glamorazi. Pure perfection
So so so happy Ingrid! I love your recs. You’re always unbiased unlike a lot of youtubers so I can trust what you’re advocating for. Not just product wise but lifestyle/book/clothing wise. So happy to have you back and I hope you enjoyed your break. It was well deserved. 💓
I remember your 2013 favorites video and thats how I first heard of the 1975! I immediately looked them up after watching and they have been my fav band since!!!!! thank u !
can u add prices too next time please?
Happy New Year, Ingrid! Love the new editing style. Hope 2019 brings a lot of good things your way
Where is your sweater from!? ❤️
When you said “$300” I literally had to pause the video and think about my life 😂 dang
The graphics were soooooo cute!!! I also love your favourites videos, thanks for making another one 💛
1. Am I the only one who thought that the Tatcha pearl eye cream looked like a fancy poke ball? 

2. First thing my eyes went to, your eyes Ingrid. The eyeliner really makes your eyes pop. You look beautiful with it (and without it, duh!)
I look forward to this video every year!!!!!
$300 for skincare is a scam. Don't fall for it! It probably cost the company like $10 to make especially if you know how cheap hyaluronic acid is.
I love the new graphics! Happy 2019 🎉
I like the little graphics that you added in. 💕
For anyone dealing with a dry/itchy scalp, I recommend the t/sal shampoo. It's unscented, gentle, and cheap. It really exfoliates the scalp without stripping your hair.
I'm so excited for this!! Your videos are always amazing and I love that sweater!! 💖💜
I’ve been watching for almost a decade! Love your growth and you !!💗💗💗
Looking forward to your videos for 2019! And I did very much appreciate your heart shirt
Whatever eye look you are wearing looks so pretty! Could you do a tutorial with it?
also, what color lipstick are you wearing? It perfectly matches your sweater!
Yesss so excited for this video! Tell me all the things, Ingrid!!! (And happy new year 💕)
Love this video a lot! Really enjoyed the small effects you incorporated to show us detail. I’m sure your 2019 videos will be awesome.....just like the rest you always put out. Can’t wait to see the empties one soon!
All these 10 years I have followed so many youtubers. But no one could ever replace you. The moment I am on my YouTube it has to be you. I still watch your oldest videos at times. Love you 💕
thanks for sharing your favorites!! great to see you back. looking forward to more videos!!
Happy New Year  Ingrid your smile makes me happy
I remember back in the day you would always use the Kiel’s avocado eye cream 😊
Love your videos! You deserve all the followers in the world you work so hard girl :)
Who else loves Ingrid's videos🙋🏼‍♀️
I love your videos but these days I find that almost all your products are very expensive still I watch it. But it would be nice if you do some affordable ones too.
You’re too cute, making me laugh. Thanks.
I’m really  hurt reading comments that people leave you. You are a lovely young woman, you have always had a huge heart, i started watching you 10 years ago and again i am hurt by what people are saying, as if you were suppose to stay the exact same person forever. I think everyone comes to a point where things become mundane. Everyone in their career goes through this. I will always love your content and you as a person, i feel like you are relatable and you look stunning. ❤️
I am loving your favorites of 2018 💗💗💗💗
Ingrid, where is your sweatshirt from? It's so cute :)
Love your edits around our treasures! Wishing you beautiful bright under eyes and a silky-smooth canvas all year long! 💜
absolutely love the lil cute graphic work!! As usual, I love your favorites! <3 Looking forward to more content from you in 2019! :)
These alwayssss throw me back to the missglamourazzi Days (phew, I hope I spelled that right 😂) I always loveddd your recommendations! 😍
Really great video Ingrid! I love the new editing style 😄
I love your personality. You are such a joy and always brighten up my day! (:
Been waiting so long for this. It's nice to see you back!
Love the fun, cute graphics! ✨✨✨ Thanks for all the helpful recommendations - I always get so many great product tips from your favorite videos. 🌈
Ingrid, I loved the cute drawing edits on the close ups of the products, subtle cute touch, but I noticed. <3
Love your sweater.  Where did you get it .😍
Never use anything ever that burns or tingles! That means it’s damaging your skin! 
As for a great hyaluronic serum try Paula’s Choice. Their products are superb!
Happy New Year and all the best in 2019 Ingrid!! 

I’d love to see a favourite books, podcasts and/or apps video.

... and where is that adorable heart sweater from??!!!
Where did you get your sweater??? I LOVE IT!
I just adore your Favorites videos!! keep it up girl! We love you 🐥
The cute graphics 😍
Great video! Love the mix of affordable and splurge products.
I love this background setting wow. The graphics were cute too!
Such a great video to start the year! Can’t wait for more videos this year from you Ingrid!! 😊
Subscribed years ago because you liked doughnuts as much as me but girl,  your channel is unrelatable. You made a video against consummerism not long ago and yet everything you recommend is super expensive. Not all of us make 2k a month, some are lucky if they reach 1k.
Happy 2019 Ingrid! I'm so excited for the upcoming content: you've been doing an amazing job on this channel and it's so interesting and inspiring to see how much your content has changed and grown up (and improved) with you :)
Btw, I really like the new little graphics! And I also appreciate the extensive descriptions, xx
Love the video Ingrid - really well edited, I can see that you had some help with that. What is the camera that you use please as the quality of your videos is always amazing?
happy new year ingrid!! i've been watching you since 2012 and it's amazing to see you hitting all these milestones :)
have you ever tried the Vichy Mineral 89 hyaluronic serum?  Might be a good dupe for Sturm.  xoxo
Thanks for the recommendations! Will definitely be trying some of these products 😊
What are your favorite books of the year?
Who else wants ALL OF THESE products now 🙈🙋🏻‍♀️
Love the new graphics/animations!
Love your makeup! You make me smile!! Thanks
Hi Ingrid, thank you for sharing your favourites. I took notes 😂
I was scrolling through your channel the other day... May I suggest that you try again purple liner? I still cannot get over how amazing your eyes look in that colour!
You're glowing! It's been so... heart-warming (?) to watch the evolution of your channel over time. I cannot always relate to the beauty content, mostly because I'm broke. But, you know, student life. 
I wish you all the best for 2019 <3
I can't stop looking at your beautiful eye makeup! 😍
Hi Ingrid, where's your jumper from and what about your foundation!!! xxx
Does any one know how old is Ingrid. She looks so young and beautiful.
Thanks for posting this - lots of things I want to try out now :) you seem very refreshed after your end of year break, btw!
Just wondering if you'll do a non-makeup/skincare favorites video of 2018 (for books, films, lifestyle items, etc). Looking forward to the new content! xo
Oml!!! Im sorta a new subscriber and i love your shirt, where did you get it?  Also im interested to try some of the products you mentioned
Loved the video <3 I just realized that I didn't have your notification bell on, so I wasn't getting all of your videos
Why are you so pretty?!!!! But seriously your shirt and lip is over the top! Love ya! Have a great weekend!!
4:27 Ingrid: This looks like a makeup product... Me: It looks like a poké ball!
A 2019 best books video!
For those of you who are more fair/light skinned, the NARSissist Wanted 1 pallet is really great too and has some lighter colors!
I’ve been having the same problem this winter with itchy scalp!! My go-to product is just  a tiny drop of tea tree essential oil on the spots that itch the most. IT WORKS! Pretty affordable too since you can use tea tree essential oils for a lot of other things...
I loved the editing— the graphics and leaving in some of the less planned parts. Ingrid you rock
Such cute editing! Love you Ingrid!
Ingrid, I've been subscribed to your channel since high school (I'm a college graduate now.) I have to say that I always keep coming back to you because you're so down to earth and the lifestyle/beauty/home products that you recommend are always great. A lot of the other youtubers who I watched in high school have changed by only using over $100+ products which isn't rational for someone like me who is barely out of college and at my first 8-hour Mon-Fri job. A lot of the time those $100+ products aren't better than something like the Soap and Glory body butter and I appreciate how you also see that. I love seeing how you and your channel have grown and I know I can always count on your channel to tell me what's a investment in beauty/lifestyle to make. Thank you for being real. Sending love from California ❤️❤️❤️
Hi Ingrid!! What shade do you use in RMS un cover up? :)
Love the cute graphics and editing of this video! Happy new year :)
Hi Ingrid, I was wondering If you could make a video about some of your favorite books, you've said that you read a lot, so I'm curious so as to know what kind of books you like reading. 
Btw, I love the peace that you inspire; as an introvert I love when people are peaceful and transmit that quiet energy. Greetings from Mexico.  💕
Great video Ingrid. You showed some pretty good stuff that i want to try especially the fresh kombucha product. Happy New year. I cant wait to see what 2019 brings you.
I love this video! The editing is amazing and also I missed seeing you in pink :) I think it looks super fresh on you! I’m a loooong loooong time subscriber since your super long hair days 😄
What is your current favorite natural deodorant? Also love you so much you are incredible!
Watching you brings back the OG beauty guru vibes ! Can’t wait to try out some new products that may work for me!
So excited your very first product is packaging free! Right on ❤️❤️❤️
I saved this video to watch for a rough day. Today my family had to put down our dog (my aunt &uncle’s dog) who I love and feel so loved by. I said goodbye to him today and my heart is broken. 💔 I am glad he won’t be scared or in pain anymore. 
Thank you for your videos as always, they bring me joy even in the darkest of times. About to rewatch the video while taking a much needed bubble bath.
have you tried Vichy 89 ? it also is with hyaluronic acid and I am loving this, and great price point aswell :-)
Thanks! What's your favorite tea?
Thank god for this ~shorter~ best of beauty round up!!!!
Great video! I love the little sketch/graphic edits like the flowers and the dots. Really added a nice touch
Love your posts!! I so wish that I could afford the Dr.Strum HA serum! Maybe one day 😪 Is there a more affordable HA serum that you would recommend in the meantime? Thank you and I hope 2019 is going well so far ☺️
Your editing is on point! 💕
Such a pro and love the background :)
PLEASE do a tutorial on your video editing!
I wish you would include more affordable options in your videos. I like the new graphics in the videos though
Love watching your Favorites videos!
Love this and your haircut!!!! 😍😁
Needed this
Your favourite recommendations have always been my fave - I trust your opinion so much Ingrid xo
Ever thought about growing out your hair and donating it? I ask because I know you have never dyed it :) much love!
Loved this! Did you save your 2018 empties for a video?
Really liked the little extra animations with products! ❤️
You should try the Paulas Choice Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It is SOOO good...and a little less pricey ;)
Loved your reviews Ingrid. Best wishes for a great new year!!!🤗
YESSS MY FAVE OG YOUTUBER AND SHE STILL DOES ORIGINAL VIDEOS LIKE FAVORITES. THANK YOU FOR LOVING US AND STILL STAYING TO YOUR ROOTS I LOVE YOU INGRID <3 <3 :CCC
You're amazing, Ingrid! Thank you to you and your team for taking the time to making this video :)
Love the graphics, Ingrid!
Love the editing!!
Cool, less than 40 views!
I laughed out loud a couple times during this video! I’ve definitely experienced the “questioning” phase while filming 😂
Happy New year. 
Have you tried ‘ paulas choice hyaluronic acid booster’. I Think it is very good.
Missed you! ❤️ love this and I’m going to try to of these so thanks!
Your skin looks amazing so this video was definitely wanted! <3
Love how your lipstick matches your shirt 💖
I’m really going to have to 👀 look into the shampoo as a guy w/ kinky textured hair I need something that doesn’t dry out my hair.
Where is your sweater from Ingrid??? I love it.  Thanks!!!! xoxo
It makes me joyously happy that I've been watching you since I was like twelve, and you have consistently remained one of my favorite YouTubers for the past eight years. You're honest, you're funny, you're real. Ingrid you're just...you're a real one.
i support to your channel i sub you keep it up and rock on
For the past few winters I have experienced very dry and itchy scalp, and as consequence, have tried almost all shampoos I could.
This year I realized the reason this happens to me is because of my shower temperature, so I wash my hair before I bathe, with lukewarm water. My scalp has been so much better with the itchiness!!
Love your graphics!
the animations are so cute! love your skincare recs always
I love the new graphics. They’re so cute 💜
You laugh contagiously. 😊
Could you share what folding bed you have in your background ? And the headboard please!
I love how you mentioned the NARcisist blush palette and the lancome lipstick. They have been my staples but no one ever really mentions them.
Editing was so cute!
This was great, the animation/graphics made it greater!!! Miss these videos, Ingrid!!!!
Hi Ingrid! Hope that you are having an amazing day. As I was listening that you have videos prepared for this year and that you are turning 30, I just thought that I have been watching your videos since I was 17. That's almost 7 years. And If you are reading this and I can let you know just 1 thing is that I TOTALLY LOVE the woman that you became. It has been such a joy to grow up together in some kind of way. I would love to see a video talking about your growing experience and how your evolution from your beggining in YouTube 10 years ago was and where you are right now. Muchos abrazos!
Loved the illustrations 😍😍😍
Is it weird that your voice is so soothing to me? Love your videos!
This editing 😂😂😂
I’ve been with you all 10 years and still feel so connected to you. Largely because I bought and loved so many of your recommendations from the time I was in middle school ❤️ I still have my original almost-gone NYC sunny bronzer 😂😭 anyone else?!
Loved the video and editing! so soothing!
Yucky yucky soap and glory stuff full of perfume.
You are looking good girl ❤️
Happy new year Ingrid ☺️ I started watching your videos in 2012 and literally learned everything about makeup from you! I also flew to LA and you had a meetup at The Grove in 2014 and it was so awesome meeting you. I just wanted to thank you and let you know that your videos always bring me such a good mood! Love from Finland 💙
You are such a beauty💕
What shade of the pearl do you use??? I really wanna purchase but don’t know which shade
yay turning 30 buddies! ❤️
ingrid can you please bring back you hungry healthy happy series in 2019 i still to this day love to make you spring salad recipe you made in your first episode of the series (and the green dream smoothie)
I love the pekee and juju bars, they are so amazing!!! no one talks abt them, but they are amazing
I cannot thank you enough for the Scalp Revival recommendation. I have heard other people say it was great, but once you said it, I knewI needed to try it. I have tried so many things for my scalp, it is AWFUL, and this is like straight up magic. Life saver!
I miss the days where your favorites were affordable to regular people.
Ilysm , Ingrid!🤗💕
what happened to your teeth?  hope all is good xx
Loved this video and you are so funny 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️💕💯🤙🏻💟 ps how is Nugget? Does he get along with Tayto?
Love the graphics!
DANG you're turning 30!!!! and i'm not too far behind you! time is so freaking fast haha what the heck! i love you ingrid! i would love to meet you some day! <3 T_T
Did you have a favorite eyeliner?
Ingrid are your teeth ok? They look so different to me. I know I'm not the only one thats noticed a difference.
Love the illustrations!
Do you use a ring light?
Hey Ingrid! I got the body builder after you did you review video, but it makes my hair really sticky. Do you have any more detailed tips on how to use it? I think I may be using it wrong!
Loved the little doodles! Hope you’ve had a great new year!
I wish people would stop promoting brands that test their products on animals :( Like Lancome and Fresh.. Maybe if enough people called those brands out on that they would make a change in their testing policies. Unfortunately they see it as too high of a cost to pull out of countries that require it by law like China.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi Ingrid :). Where is your sweater from?
Happy new year!😊🤗
I love how concise and short this video was (especially with it being a yearly roundup) but I was not a fan of the illustrations over and around the products. It was super distracting and made it difficult to see the actual products and swatches.
There’s an actress that looks almost exactly like you
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!
Hello Ingrid!! 

It is so nice to hear your voice again. I was wondering if you could consider reviewing the filling products / brands: Teke bar from Drunk Elephant, the Violet-C Serum from Tatcha, BareMinerals Blemish Rescue Powder, Prose custom hair products, Kate Somerville Eradikate or something similar. And also your favorite products from Too Cool for School. 

I also just wanted to say how much I appreciate your videos and who you are as a person. It has only been a year and a half since I found your channel, but I truly don’t know what I would do without it. This has given me so much knowledge, perspective, and refuge.

I love your thought process and how thoughtful you are, and also how thorough and helpful your videos are. The product related ones, and just the ones about developing as a human and livin life. I’m an INFJ, almost the same to your INTJ and I feel like I also just love how someone else out there can think in a very similar way to me, but who I also learn so much from. Thank you so much for sharing so much of yourself.
Lm caviar sticks are bomb
Ingrid: “why I almost completely stopped shopping”

Also Ingrid: here’s a bunch of crap you need to buy because a lot of these people sponsored me.

Lol, you really can’t have it both ways. Speaking out against consumerism and materialism but shilling products for a living. You don’t make sense.
Where you bought this jumper ?
Wow i havent seen Ingrid with eyeliner on in so long
Does the glossier lash slick hold your curl? I have stick straight lashes
Linda ❤
Your teeth look dirty or stained. Is it just my phone?
Love all these so much 😍😍😍😍
WOO missed you!
I used to use that simple water boost moisturizer, but after a while it started to irritate my sensitive skin :( too bad cause i liked it
Where is your sweater from?
No to be rude but why does your teeth look dirty
Happy new year ❤️
LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! 😘
2nd
YESSSS
Your top is so cute where did u get it?
Just saw your review on collagen. Don't know how your channel turned on my feed but here I am. You asked about other reviews that we want to see or know about. Collagen vs. Biotin pills, biotin pills broke my skin out sometimes but did help my hair grow longer. I was wondering would just taking collagen would be better? Have you ever taken Dr Berg vinegar pills for digestion again you may not have any digestion problems so it's just a question. Have you ever taken black seed oil if so what do you think? New subbie, you seem interesting and not a know it all, annoying  type of You Tuber.
Love your hair!
how does she edit her videos?
Why you so cuuuuuuuute ❤️
Cute editing!
What cleared your acne
Cute illustrations!
Please do an empties soon! I’m dying for it!
hi Ingrid my name is Lauren and my birthday is....February 21 and i am a huge fan.
5th 😀
who would dislike this video
Hey Ingrid
I’ve always been a fan of the Tea Tree Special Shampoo and Conditioner. Recently I’ve discovered the scalp treatment and it’s magic. You use it as a scalp mask and rinse it out. I have problems with dermatitis on my scalp and it’s made a HUGE difference.
I never knew I needed this video until I watched it! Thank you Ingrid for such a great, informative video! 💛
I really miss this kind of content from you. 😞
Cute sweater!
Hey Ingrid. Can I ask what you use on your teeth? 😊
I have somewhat my year life goal is to realign myself with God... so much is going on with my life right now i just have Go back to basic and really Find what is important in my life 😭😭Love 2019 looking forward to it
You’re very nice lady. You have gorgeous feet miss.
I like u but you getting a bit boring  talking about care products  talk about your love life or something
“Ingredients”? More like “INGRIDients” am I right?
Would have been nice to see you bite into them to see the gooey inside bit
Ingrid this camera is soooo awesome! Also this sweater 😍😍 Girl you are a chocolate chunk if the world were a cookie. Don't let anyone tell you you're only a chip. 😂 Thanks for always spreading your positivity with the world 🍪
A very nice and cozy vid, but I was really surprised to see that you didn’t try them or even break one open so that we could see the inside? Usually in cooking videos people try the food. However it definitely looks delicious so I will have to try this recipe and I loved your kind words at the end. Wishing you a happy holiday season, Ingrid! Lots of love xx
Dang I needed to see the gooey inside 😭
Girl, pick up a cookie scooper - it's life changing!
The camera quality of this video is amazing!
Omg this was exactly what I needed! Thanks for sharing :)
tried this recipe and they're in the over as we speak!! will keep you guys updated! 😍
Missy from Daily Bumps makes this recipe idk why you need to dissolve the baking soda with water?!?!...cinnamon gives it a kick and(I use)orange 🍊 flavoring it's so good!cake flour makes them fluffy and bread flour makes them flatter,always better to cool the dough any cookie dough chilled batter is better...these are a awesome cookie and you did a great job,love your sweater.❣️✨🎄🎅🏼🤶
Rudolph on your sweater 😂 so cute!  You are so organized and poised Always!!!!
Thank you for mentioning that Christmas can be hard on some of us.  My husband passed away last year, and I don't feel I belong anywhere anymore...even with family.  Merry Christmas to you!
I love your sweater ❤️
Love, love, LOVE your sweater, Ingrid! Wonderful recipe, thank you :)  Happy Holidays!  Xoxo
I’m going to make this right now! Will you be going to Thailand again anytime soon?!
I was making this cookie recipe and 1/2 cup of butter wasn't enough. I did everything the way you did, what am I doing wrong
I just came here from family guy 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Ooooh i love the idea of adding cinnamon, i love cinnamon lol
I tried these and they are divine! Great recipe, thanks for sharing 👌
I made this today and my whole family loved it. Thank you Ingrid! 😘
YUM sign me up for a dozen of these please!
I'm literally only here because Family Guy day for a shout-out
Excellent vid! Love the idea of adding almond extract 😍 Now I'm sorry if I'm out of line here but, what the heck do you do for a living girl? Bc that is a beautiful kitchen with supreme equipment haha. Definitely envious. I'm a new sub so I have no clue what your career is. Do you do YouTube full time? Sorry for asking if you've already made a vid about this topic before..
Is the white sugar granulated or caster sugar?
Merry Christmas Ingrid 💖. Enjoy your Holidays ♡
Tried them..would go lighter on the almond extract for my taste 😖
This camera quality is to die for ❤️
Thank you Ingrid!😄🌸💕🌈✨

I enjoyed watching vlogmas so much!!

Merry christmas and happy new year!🤗💖

See you next year! 😄👋💕✨
love the sea salt twist, never thought of that YUM..and i need that sweater :)

Merry Christmas, Ingrid! 💓 much love from the Philippines! Enjoy your holidays!
We're doing baked goods for gifts this year and these are perfect! Thanks for sharing :)
I've actually been binging on your old cooking videos back when you were on popsugar so this was a nice treat for me to see you make a cooking video again.
Those cookies look so yummy! Merry Christmas, Ingrid!! 😊💙

Hey Ingrid you are rocking in YouTube I was wondering if you could do a collaboration with Hannah Hart
Ilysm , Ingrid!🥰💕

You didn’t even eat them on camera!! That’s the best part!

Chocolate Chip Cookies are my favourite cookies
Love ya girl! Also I love chocolate chip cookies!!!
this looks like such a simple yet delicious recipe for chocolate chip cookies, love the quality of this video ingrid! <3

p.s, try using a ice cream scooper to scoop out the dough onto the baking sheet; this will help the cookies become puffy and soft :p
definitely gonna try this out!
i love you ingrid!
Just made these and they are DELICIOUS!
ur so precious
love the sweather
Hi Ingrid N.I  was curious to find out who created Vlogmas and your name came up. You started its inception was in 2011, and now it is a phenomenon!   I do not celebrate the holidays, but I thought this was interesting!
wow i need right now!!
I love u!!
‪any small youtubers want to support each other? 💓 we post frequently!‬
i love your sweater ❤
someone make these and tell me how it goes
Hope u too have a great hollyday and a great new year
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, Ingrid! You always have such great recipes! Do you have any recommendations for almond extract substitutes for people with nut allergies?
Hey Ingrid thank you so much for this video, the cookies look fantastic! May I ask how long you stir the butter and sugar together for? I use a hand mixer and put it on low but it never looked creamy and consistent like yours. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas!
I spent all day yesterday making my mom's ( gone and missed dearly) butter cookies and sugar cookies and today is icing day. I had the flour situation yesterday and learned my lesson about putting in small amts. of flour at a time. Merry Christmas to you and Erica and those you love..
Happy Holidays Ingrid!!!!!!  My family is soooooooooooo supportive
Ilove you so much
Those cookies look so good 😊
Love a good chocolate chip cookie!
