Bold of you to assume I own airpods
Your ears wouldn't hear broke
Next vid: Can airpods prevent pregnancy?
The voice in this video is 17 percent gayer than usual
Then you wouldn’t be able to hear anything
Your ears become immune to people who lack monetary funds
Watching this even though I don’t have airpods lol
WELL
RIP my 90% of friend's ears then ._.
Everyone: airpods



Me: the 1 dollar headphones from a 99 cent store
You would have the ability to flex 24/7
WHAT?!?? I CAN’T HEAR YOU!
What if you could only hear this video with AirPods®?
*Watches Video*

* Slowly takes off Airpods *
What is the point of this premiere thing? if you have the video just post it
who else turned their sound down when hearing loss was mentioned?
What happens if you ran out of ideas:
You will be able to flex a lot





About your hearing loss
AsapScience : It could cause permantant hearing loss!
Me : yall hear sum'n?
Can't relate I have wired airpods ✌🏻
I've wondered this for a while. Thanks for this video. I'll never see  airpods the same way aftet that story. 🤢
you wouldn’t be able to hear broke
Please make a video about Deja vu
I will never take off my airpods.




Because I haven't any airpods :/
Airpod: works

Stomach acid: Am I a JokE tO yOu?!
Airpods and head phones are for weaklings. 
That why I use the classic ones Aka: strings on cans
may i request a video on how to cope with the fact that you're definitely going to be deaf by 50 because i've received some bad news
Why do I always come across AirPod videos while wearing them
Human Being: Exist

Airpod Ears: I smell B R O K E
Can you get abs with laughing?
3:25 you said trains in Sweden 🇸🇪 and then you colored some white and blue flag?
next time speak louder please,I can't hear you!!!!!
"What if YOU never took off your Air Pods"

Me: "I don't have Air Pods an broke" 

:(
How to know the number of decibels your headphones produce?
am i the only one who turn the volume down a bit during the video?
"Those aren't earpods..." -Mitch
"They are now..." Greg puts hands over wires

😂😂😂😂😂😂 Why is this so funny?
WAX buildup!! 🤪🤢🤭👂
 Hearing loss! 👂
I never wear earphones or headphones because they are uncomfortable...
Spongebob panting: I can’t her you

Air pods: what
Makes a video about air pods
uses wired headphones*
Uh oh!! I fall asleep every night while listening to music
They really be hyping like that
They'd fall out with a bad design like that.
Can you make a video about the reaction with crushed vitamin b6 in icing making it glow under black light?
I produce too much ear wax obviously
When I don’t use q-tips the wax literally falls out
The best part of the video was when he says he's Android user for life, he definitely knows what's best. Cheers to that 😎✌💚
Then you would look like the richest most Gucciest man alive.
Someone in my class said they lower the effects of cancer... Obviously someone called him stupid immediately after 😂
What would if you never airpods?
I just remembered about this channel 1 year and a half later, why haven't I received any notifications of you uploading videos?
Totally like mitch and android for life
7 hours of week? I thought 7 hours per day! Damn! :(
I can just picture someone watching this with earbuds in 😂
Can you explain to us the science of fasting? That would b gr8
5:02 He Is FlExInG oN uS wItH hIs AiRpOd StRaPs 😂
Watching this with airpods 
Actually no, with the cheap ones from tiger 
Just wanted to feel cool for a second
What would happen if you stopped talking?
I'm convinced that Asap Science made this video to flex their own airpods
I literally never take out my headphones. Idk. Lol
2 nights ago I slept with my air pods in 😂. While typing this one of them died 💀
Airpods can be used by android users too! It’s bluetooth not appletooth!
i sleep with AirPods..

uh I either sleep with my face in the pillow or with my mask on
so i think I’m safe
I just let it go and watch other videos
I have AirPods with strings...
AsapScience: Hello fellow kids
I usually put my headphones either on top of my ears, on my shoulder, or on the table
When you had headphones and take them out after watching this cause
This is not accurate because air pods do not seal the ear like in ear headphones do so infection and moisture humidity changes will not occur
Can't happen if you dont have earpods
Well, I have fake AirPods. They were $27. And they’re not very good. Lol
Watching this video with airpods on, which I've been wearing for a while now. Wish me luck
Where’s the other dude? I miss him, he’s better imo 👍🏼
Holy shit .. i wear headphones 10 to 14 hours a day .. and this for the last 9 years.
Doesn't this apply to any earburds or headphones?
I’ve been gaming using headphones for about 9 years now and my hearing is good ?  I’ll say just low your volume < and let one ear breath at a time take breaks
You wouldn’t be able to speak broke ever again
Who else is wearing AirPods while watching this
Is anybody wearing Airpods while watching this video?Just me?
No one:
asapSCIENCE:
what if you never took off your airpods
i have my wireless headphones on for hours a day... im screwed
I don't use Q-tips, my ear wax just drops out of my ear in small flakes.
oh no he cant heae us
Don't have airpods but still watching this video.
I’m so triggered by this video 🤣 I kept using q tips/cotton swabs/ear buds whatever you wanna call them, in my ears & developed 2 ear infections in both ears, so I essentially had 4 infections at once. I lost quite a lot of hearing during that period and I’m still recovering 😭🤣 DONT USE THEM GUYS!!!!
Earwax build is caused by a number of factors.
I was watching these with my airpods😭😭
You can take my q-tips from my cold dead hands
Damnnn listening to this with earphones on at max volume :/
Now I'm scared. I listen to entire 2hour streams continuously throughout the day with earphones on. Am I gonna go deaf ?
Funny that you’re talking about AirPods, because I actually am
I’d be in my coffin, wearing those AirPods
Bone conduction for the win, just sayin😉
auctualy the middle ear since the shíts never go that far into your ears. i have small "cute boy" ears so no its not like they stay in.
im actually watching this with earphones bc im broke af
Uhm

Im sorry. EarPods is NOT my style 😐
Bold of you to assume I have AirPods
Broke bois have airpods.
Real bois have beats or skullcandy
Meh I break my earbuds/headphones too quickly to have this happen. I've always a but paranoid about stuff like this. My suspicions were only confirmed when my science teacher talked about this. Now I don't use earbuds or headphones unless for class
So just keep the sound down to less then half to keep my hearing good?
Galaxy Bud: Am I a joke to you?
I can understand how belly buttons are made,but how are innies and outies made?
Lol. I guess ASAP Science is running out of ideas. 
-Guys what do we talk about this time
silence 
looks around and sees someone wearing AirPods
-What about AirPods?!!!!
-Okay..... i like it so far.... What about them?!
-What if you...... never took them..... off.
-I LOVE IT YOURE HIRED!!!!!!!!!
WATCHIGNG: 2:28


leaves right after
Who else is watching with airpods in?
The first thing I thought about was Mildred Montag and her seashells 🤔
Are use Q-tips out of the shower!
Wait people take off AirPods?
Who else is watching this while wearing air pods
What about the effects of radiation on the brain for having the AirPods in?
Too late. Got  permanent beep in my ears since 1 month
watching this with my AirPods on 
After 5 minutes : okay I’ve to get this off my ear or else imma get an infection
Actually at 85 db or higher you should have hearing protection.
But how much hearing loss would occur?


15%?


I could live with that
Yeyy,somebody on youtube is android for life
#androidforlife
No one: 

No one in the universe:

ASAP Science: What if you kept your AirPods in your ears Forever
Next if you left over the ear hearing protection on when you sleep, or all the time.
Listening with AirPods right now 😂
“Keep the volume LOWER! than 75%”
...
puts down the volume
You would be able to flex 24/7.
Now I never want to wear headphones again! 😂
Galaxy buds* thanks
Weird way to flex on us
My one rule is that my headphones no matter what must stay at 30% or lower at all times
And then you get Sweden’s flag wrong
I don’t like how this video sounds gayer than normal
Why are my ears starting to hurt? This is literally the first video I'm watching today.
Perhaps it's the nocebo effect
I don't have airpods, so duh
Dude I sleep with them every night don’t tell me this :(
I have wired headphones and I don’t put the in my ear I hand them over my ears the I turn it up to top volume and you are still the only person  who can hear
Baby driver seemed to have no problem at all...
I sleep with my air pods in every night, never swallowed mine lol
2:35 i was not prepared for that ringing
watching these on my airpods
Who else is wearing air pods while watching this
* Immediately Reduces Volume *
Switches to watching Porn Muted
Ear buds have never fit properly in my ears. No matter how hard I try, they're ready to pop out. I recently got a pair that have an extra part that fits into the outer folds of your ear and they're amazing! Whenever I see air pods, I think "how do they not fall out?!"
I would die cuz I wouldn’t head anything
Please don’t say hypothet- situat-
Hey Apple air pods ain't in small town Saskatchewan yet so don't assume
“If SmElLs LiKe BrOkE iN hErE”
I wear my earbuds on full volume 16 hours a day... oops 😂
i would become kind of concerning if your airpods were dangling our of your ears
I love the video but I think you mispronounced cochlea?
"YouTube's Algorithm ignites"
I watch this video with my AirPod (I only have one I lost the other)
I've got Misophonia and pretty much live in headphones, soooo I guess I'll go deaf eventually.
Greg's voice over was great 😂 had me laughing a few times
I’m too broke to watch this
This is how you know they are running out of ideas😂
Wear my hearing aids all day (take m off at night) and that isn’t a problem they have to be cleaned tough so if you would still occasionally take your AirPods out to clean them and you wouldn’t have them fall of sleeping which is kinda likely there should be no problem
Why specifically airpods WeirdChamp
Always wearing Air Pods.

...honk, honk.
5:00 I love Android
I’m wearing airpods while watching this
4:59 because I am android user for life
AsapSCIENCE is running out of ideas
Watching with AirPods. Yeah.






Wait I mean FakePods...
First of all what are airpods
In this hypothet situaysh...🤣
I kept lowering the volume during the video 😅
Is it better to use speakers than earbuds/headphones??
I just watched your science style video and I got curious and wanted to ask you guys to make if you could make a video about your vocal ranges or about the larynx or vocal box which ever you would perfer and explain how it works.
Devices should tell you how loud the sound really is like wtf is 50% volume? 50% of what??? How are we supposed to look after our ears w o this info
I'm sure the US has an Empire-related random equivalent for decibels.
Watching this with my AirPods
The thumbnail made me feel so damn uncomfortable 😷😷
Can you talk about what goes on when you get the stomach virus
2:30 well thank god i dont wear those
Earphones in general or just airpods then specifically lol
uwu what's this?


Oh no..
This wouldn't be a problem for me bc I don't own one hehe
3:30
Sweden gang
Do an apple vs android please!
Nah, all my hearing loss is from a metronome
Thanks for the tip. Wait, where’s my AirPods?
Only use Airpods with the exclusive wire accessory




They are called 
Asapscience with the relevant important questions 👌🏼👌🏼
I would be great if you guys could teach biology chemistry and physics cause I have tests and don’t understand from anyone due to me having the attention span of a squirrel
Raise your hand if don't even have a airpod!!
i used to listen to sound from my computer at halfway full volume about 2 years ago. my bro told me it was gonna cause hearing loss. he suggested i keep it at 1/3 full. i got used to it quickly. thanks bro.


annnd. i sleep with my earpods (not airpods) on. what happens if you do? is there risk of being strangled? sometimes i wake up with them wrapped very weakly around my neck, but thats uncommon. 


also. if i happened to swallow a airpod,,,, it wouldnt go well for me. i have diahrea constipation so that thing is gonna be in there for awhile. speakin of which, I VOW TO NEVER TOUCH SOMEONES AIRPODS. because. who knows, they may have swallowed it
I don't have Airpods. My old wired headphones are good enough for me. Besides, I'm team Android, more of a reason not to get them.
This video was made just for them to flex their airpods.
Can you do a video about sickle cell disease please
He has air pods on, HE CAN'T HEAR US!
Who’s listening with their AirPods 🙋🏼‍♀️
Q-tips cause earwax in the same way that Kleenex causes colds.
I wouldnt hear my wife in bed and would get divorced eventually. Also i wouldnt hear broke
Did you just say hypothet situage
you guys should do one on blue light
Love that as time goes on you are more confident at portraying more of your own personalities into these factual videos! Love you both
Next video: how much money would be lost if everyone destroyed their James Charles palette 



You all know we're gonna need it
yeah umm if i shitted an airpod out im giving that shit to a lab to fully disinfect
can someone tell me a summary cuz i can’t turn on my sound rn
I’m disliking because you premiered it. Waste my time
Apple: faster charging so you can keep your AirPods in all day

ASAP science: I’m about to end this mans whole career
Why would i wear them in the first place ?
Headphones are better for me
who were using airpods while listening to this?
Answer: You become a highly skilled getaway driver and Kevin "don't touch me there" Spacey calls you baby in a totally none creep way....
you wouldn't even notice because they don't cancel out any noise
I have always wondered what would happen if I kept my air pods in forever?
When you spoke about tinnitus,  the beep you played is exactly the kind i get and i just winced lol
i think they just wanted to flex the fact that they had airpods through out the cudeo
That thumbnail has put me off earphones forever
is Greg, James Charles brother, oh sorry i mean sister
A question the whole world wants to know. What if you never took your air pods? 

Do yall not have other good science questions ??
AirPods don’t run iOS, you can still use them with any device that has Bluetooth 😂
Airpods work with Android now
Starts the video with headphones on.
Slowly takes them out by the end of the video.
RIP: Arthur Morgan
3:26 That is not a swedish flag on the train
Now this is the scientific and educational content I subscribed for
So I found a full set of ipods with a protective case too, randomly lying on the street. Jealous? 😂
no thanks ill keep my galaxy buds in
Who lowered there sound on your earbuds while watching this video?
broke boy lmao I can just buy apple hearingaids when they come out
What about the radiation side effects of airpods. Are they harmful ?
i’m watching this video using my airpods 💀🤷🏻‍♂️
Lol ever since I learned about how headphones/earphones like maybe a week ever since I got headphones for the first time I never used them again,lol
Hehe i lowered the volume when I mentioned 75%
Bold of you to assume I use apple
I always have my volume on 1 or 2 little boxes the max it gets to is 4
the way he said good 😂 4:12
I highly doubt that airpods will reach soundlevels of 139 decibels thats more than a starting jet
And in generel some information given in this video leave me questioning your sources 

The production of more ear wax than usual can be triggered by earplugs for some people so i dont get why you deny that
I dont wear airpods anymore cause i broke it while left in my points pocket and throw into laundry
AirPods actually work really well with Android.
Nice explantion  and nice drawings...sir....🙏👍
Who else is watching with AirPods
What if I never took off my AirPods? Well, they’d fall out 5 seconds later even if I’m sitting perfectly still. They simply don’t fit me, which is why I don’t own them. I know I’m not the only one because my twin brother has the same problem. He does own AirPods but has to 3D print his own ear hooks to keep them on.

When Apple first revealed the design used in the AirPod when they announced the EarPods they claimed that they had scanned 3D models of thousands of ears and scientifically engineered them to be the perfect shape to fit the most ears. Somehow, they missed my perfectly normal-looking ears even though they still fit my friend and his entire family who don’t seem to have any ear lobes.

I first realized this when my friend got a Game Boy in 1989 and the bundled earbuds did not stay in my ears at all. I figured it was a problem for a lot of people which is why almost everything included proper headphones or wrap-around/behind-the-head “sports” headphones. While earbuds remained an option for people who could use them, virtually no major consumer device other than the Game Boy bundled them... until Apple got away with bundling them with the original iPod. After that, the floodgates opened and everyone started doing it. No doubt, it was cheaper.

I remember articles about ear hook accessories for your iPod where the reviewer would often start out saying “ear buds are fine as long as you are sitting down” while they go on to promote the hooks as a solution only needed for joggers and the like. This actually angered me as I was being forced to use them that day (radio headset at work) and already had to re-insert the bud over 100 times during my shift.
0:15 who else checked to see if your phones charger was magically plugged in 😂🤣

Hey yea don't be stupid I have tinnitus and it's not good and because sometime I have one ear bud In at one time its worse on the right but both are not as bad as the video shows. It's good to be taking breaks sometimes, because it can become worse.
What if women never got there periods? And what if humans layed eggs instead of giving live birth?
Android for life, f yes! Perfect union for celluliods 😍💖🤳🏼
All I took from this is the fact hat you said not to use Q tips!! What else are they use for?!  I’m still not gonna stop using them for that reason.
Talks about podcast, new episode hasn't been out in over a month...
Watches with Airpods- oh wait I'm poor
Using my AirPods while watching this 🤪🤪
Wired Earphones >>>>>>> AirPods
#TeamAndroid4Life
What about Galaxy Buds? Is it the same?

You heard Mitch! Android Army unite!
Would be nice to see a video on Tinnitus
James Charles climbs into bed with u like to undo😭
I listen to music every day with more than 12hrs a day with a volume of 20%... so I can hear what’s happening around me. I also listen to music when I sleep with a volume of 5% of volume. I tend to sleep faster when listening to music and waking up early. 🙂👌🏼👊🏼
So convenience you upload this video right after i got my airpods :(
Air pods help me not talk to randoms
I personally feel that the "character" you put into your videos is kinda weird and kinda distracts instead of adds any value to your videos. I would be delighted if you worked on it or removed it completely.
a lot more personality in the commentary in this video from past ones ive watched lol
Why did you have to specify AirPods. Wouldnt the same be true for all forms of ear buds?
"science"
lmaooo
Wait, when u refer to headphones, do u refer to on-ear headphones too?
I mostly listen with my headphones because I watch tv shows like BrBa on Netflix, my family shouldn’t suppose to hear or watch somebody fu*** in a tv show. I am really careful about it lol
I think using the premiere function is not that great for your likes.. I mean the video hasnt even started but already has 135 dislikes.
watching these with my airpods 💀
That picture of an infection with EarPods on it...that made me cringe so much that I can no longer use them without crying.Thx asapscience
First 





Is what people who aren't first say
Did you just assume our earphones type?
Can you write songs to help with revision??? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
I really never take off my earphone till I go to sleep
Why do you mention hearing loss and not tinnitus which is far more debilitating?
pulls out earphones and exits video
Ayyyy back to my fave format!
Oof an air pod out the urethra that must hurt
Rip for the people who loose their AirPods on the street
u guys r digusting talkin about how offical research sponsored by the big concerns is a proof for vaccinations to be legit HAHA , ur videos a nice bunch of naivitiy and gullibility - enjoy growing up
Anyone else listening on AirPods?
Not good enough to flex anymore.
So, TLDR working in shitty open office settings will make you go deaf, due to excessive headphone use to drown out all the sounds of collaboration. Got it 👍🏾🔥
Qtips cause ear wax? No, it can push wax deeper causing a block but 👂🏽 wax naturally occurs in ear.  So yes, if you never took out your AirPods to clean out your 👂🏽, there will be a lot of wax built up 🍯.
The AirPods have nothing to do with working in tech. I have never heard about that stereotype anywhere but this.
I never take my AirPods out really but It doesn’t mean I’m always listening to something.. is that bad for my ears? 🤣 also when I do listen I always have it on really low volume so is that fine? Thx 🙏
Never actually seen anybody use those wireless ear-pods.
I feel like the ASAP science guys get gayer every episode 😂
Then you would never be able to speak broke again
That moment when the only reason you bought earpods was for sleeping
I was listening to this with AirPods in 😂
Shit, i listen to music to fall asleep, often the playlist goes on for hours://
I have my earphones in like 2-hours a day.
Make a video about deja vu I saw this in the comments btw 💯
The ultimate flex
How many people just wanted to see what would happened but does not actually own airpods 🙋‍♂️
Well you need to charge them
I don’t get the hype around them.They’re literally only $150 trust me if you have a phone you can sure as hell afford them
7hr a week and I can lose hearing! listen to music 12-15hours a day
watches with AirPods
Hey did u know airpods can give people cancer I've never noticed that
Who else took their AirPods out 😂
listening to this with my airpods
AirPod owners can’t afford the wire
Could you make a video about what would actually happen if half of the life in the universe just vanished? (Questions that popped into my head during Endgame haha)
Who else hasn't AirPods
Comment "Here"
lol who is watching this video
with AirPods? No? Just me? Ok.
Lmao, surveying people leaving a train station on how long they listen to headphones? Anyone else see a problem with this methodology?
I'm embarrassed by how stupid you sound for saying ears don't make ear wax until you put cotton swabs in them. 😭 Ear wax is basically ear sweat that keeps particles out, like snot or tears. Humans had varying degrees of ear wax long before Q-tips existed.
1:25 -TOTALLY NOT TRUE.

there's some space in the big 'speaker' long, latitudinal(or just vertical) hole, and the longitudinal(or just horizontal) small hole that sound comes out of, which sends the 'vibration' which actually can cause the waxes in your ear to fell into it. You can see it on your airpod(you could prove me wrong if you don't have 'any' wax or germ on there even if you wore it and never cleaned it for at least half year). Check it out once in 3 month or so; there is definitely a wax buildup. Ear wax can build up till your outer ear, which I keep it very clean to prevent the pimples and stuff. Especially, if you have a hair long enough to touch your ear, you might wanna clean up your airpod once in a while.

That is, of course, if you want to maintain your Airpod clean(even on the surface there will be dusts and pollen, viruses and bacterium  from outside, so it's actually important to clean your earphones, but they usually don't cause any disease, thanks to your tympanic membranes. Although, try not to share your earphone/airpods with your friend too much; germs that was already on your ear is fine but it's unhygienic to share some germs each other with your friend.)

So, there's an actual possibility to inner-ear infection and allergic reaction on tympanic membrane which would also cause hearing problem. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS. And make sure to clean it up with alcohol before you put it back on your ear.



Suck on this, pesudo-scientists. 'Constantly having Airpods on your ear' is basically a matter of the rate of the infection buildup. I mean, sure. People wash ears when they shower. But ear wax builds up in airpod; which contains both germs and humidity which is perfect petri dish for bacterium, viruses, and other micro-organisms.

You've contradicted your own video by talking about infection. Clearly, you never actually got a proper education in medicine. Therefore, talking about a partial knowledge that you googled off? NOT COOL. You should feel shameful for even identifying yourselves as 'scientists' let alone 'researchers'.

C+, at best.
They would electrocute you in the shower
You could get Galaxy Buds for better sound quality and a better appearance...
That charge sound made me confused
You couldn’t hear us

You have AirPods in
Thank God I have Android
Now I’m scared I ate my AirPods cuz they’ve been missing for a while thanks Greg and Mitch smfh💀😂
Way nonstandard english sitch' you got gurin' on here.
Trying to be more vulgar over time? It's working; you're managing to muddy the important work of science communication.
Hey,  I have a question. Are headphones better for your health than earphones?
The moment when you thought 2:35 was your own ear ringing. 😂😅
I always have my AirPods in... please don’t do this to me.
I want to know if the internet could actually break???
That was the Finish flag at 3:33 🤔
Nobody:

ASAPScience: WHAT IF YOU NEVER TOOK OFF YOUR AIRPODS?
I learn more stuff on his channel then on any of my chemistry, physics or biology classes xD
I much rather wear over ear headphones because my problem with things like earbuds and air pods is that they easily fall out of my ears because of how having cerebral palsy affects the muscles in my body from my left side to have spasticity also known as hypertonia.
Ah! So good not to have Airpods
I LOVE YOUR HANDWRITING
Soo if taking things in and out of ears causes earwax, do earbuds cause earwax? The music kind, AirPods with cords
Rich kids be like my music at 💯 percent
Lmao who watched this with AirPods on 😂🤯
What's that sonny? Holds up ear trumpet.
Glad I still didnt buy them
literally me
Yea!! Android for life!!!
You could wear AirPods for like a day and just get the people you talk to, to call you so you can hear them.



Right..?



🤔, I may just be stupid.
Anyone else keep turning the volume down while watching this?😂
They will run out of battery
me, watching this with my airpods on
My headphones are set to 2% volume LOL
What about EMF radiation from bluetooth devices
Lol I already have hearing lost 😂🤣🤣🤣 🙂🙂🙂
I wouldn’t be able to flex on the haters
2:25 me: watches with earphones in
5:00 galaxy buds 4 life bro
4:48 "no, because I'm android for life" my boy!! Woop! woop!
AsapScience, the truck’s coming. Oh my god they have AirPods in. They can’t hear us. Oh my god.
Bold of you to assume I actually have enough money to buy airpods
I don't believe that ear wax wouldn't build up on the ear buds if you never took them out. Cerumen is excreted by the modified sebaceous glands in our ear canal walls. It naturally moves outward out of the ear canal and falls out carrying dust and debris with it. If the wax is constantly produced and naturally migrates outward and falls out, blocking the canal off with an ear bud will clearly impede the wax and cause a buildup. You are right about not using Q-tips in the ear canal; they push wax backwards. Our body wants the ear wax to move outward and fall out, so having a Q-tip pushing that wax back in is what causes a buildup that eventually needs to be removed by a professional.

That's why I found a Bluetooth speaker for my laptop because I was always wearing headphones and they were giving me headaches damn you quiet laptop speakers
Is it just me or do these videos continually get gayer
My ears actually get incredibly waxy when I take my headphones off and the only thing that fixes it is a q-tip (or two.) Explain that.
Is there a difference in how ear buds and over the ear headphones affect one's hearing?
Nobody:
AsapSCIENCE:
Ty for making me realized i listen to music too much
I never listen to music with headphones if I'm home because why would I? Only when I'm outside
wait but does this apply to all headphones or just airpods?
I can't hear you
Airpods are gross and low quality. I use skull candy hesh 3 headphones. They're great. I'd recommend anything from Sony and beats (by Dr. Dre.)
Lol, how many of you hearing this with your earphones?😂
I wear my earphones almost 24/7, I even sleep with them in. I'm scared to watch this
Asapscience is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Simple you would be one of the youngest flexers of the century.
Who else turned down their pods?
I've been out of the loop. What's this buzz over Airpods? I have only ever seen the memes.
Oh no I pretty much have my headphones in from when I wake up to when I go to sleep
I used to hate everything mac due to their closed system and extreme programmed obsolescence. Then my boyfriend had to buy a mac computer for his programming jobs. Now we hate mac even more.
E A R P O D S ®
Sorry but I will continue to use a tips, can't stand people with wax in their ears. I use a tips every day with no sign of wax build up or loss of hearing
Me listening music with airpods : I can do this all day
Airpods : I am about to end this man's whole career
This made me self-conscious because I'm watching the video using AirPods
Thought this was going to be very different
Android 4 ever! Anti Apple prople Assemble!
please make less severe-looking thumbnails
Ever since I got my air pods.. the tv has to be turned way upp...  i'm 17
What if I had AirPods?
As some people watch with AirPods on😂
0:56 how tf did he figure out it worked!?!?! Know what, I don't wanna know.
I wear my headphones almost all day long. My hearing is not what it used to be :3
Life noggin
Transduuuuuuuuceeer!😂
Yeah im fu*kd now
Now we can eat airpod
If you never took them off, you would never understand what is a real pair of headphones. And that you overpaid a glorified cheap pair just because it was branded and true wireless.
Lol, I hate headphones for the most part. My ears ring all the damn time, but my fault. I used to love loud car stereos, always driving around at at least 145db..
Except for eating and pooping my airpods.. I've done most of this. Well.. RIP my ears
Not even a minute in and its already too much for me
Some medics say that it may cause hearing loss because our ears have gases and it can also cause brain damage... but that's just a theory, a HEALTH theory!
1:18 Yep, I turned off the video after that 😂
I listen my music at like 2 (like 2 blocs)
the sound effects were so cute, loving it!
Who else took the headphones out of their ears after watching this video or during the video XD
Airpods are dumb. I'd rather get a good pair of Studio Headphones. They cost the same amount and sound way better.
Every time i hear something about how earbuds can result to hearing loss i feel horrible because i use earbuds everyday and I listen to music a LOT 😓
Bluetooth uses lossy audio compression, so say goodbye to flac quality sound if you do decide to go jackless.
sorry, i don’t speak deaf
Just started listening to loud music in 2017 and I’m 15
Im sorry i dont speak broke
What volume should I stay under when listening to music?
hearing through galaxy buds...
Oh no.... I listen to 10 hours a day with earphones... 😬
Who is wearing AirPods right now
Are u kidding me.
Android for life 💪😆
I didn’t even know AirPod were considered a status symbol. I just liked the Apple EarPods and wanted wireless ones lol
I’m using them right now... 😂
0:58 Also still 41% charged ...
Who needs AirPods when you have Minecraft
what about over the ear headphones? I wear them practically all day. Whether its to listen to music, watch videos or play games. Even going to work means wearing a headset all day for my job. I can't get away from them. I would say i spend probably 70% of my day wearing some sort of headphone.
They would be absorbed into your body tissue, permanently increasing your clout level
Well shit... i use headphones most of the day
Damn I use EarPods for less than 5 hours and I don’t use them everyday
#androidarmy
In my opinion, the subjects that they are choosing recently are getting worse.
0:57 ... love this sentence out of context. XD X'P
Android is my life
You miss the Bluetooth thing.
Yo yo-yo I love it at the beginning countdown 3 2 1
Hey this is a science channel. 
Any Brits out here who just sat their first Biology exam?
anyone else turn down the volume of your headphones after watching this video?
Yeah Android for life!!
Mate Samsung galaxy buds all the way screw iCrap.
And here I am
Watching this video using airpods
I’m a big fan, suggestions for videos PLS. Hormone replacement for men opinion piece (i have pituitary issues), Nootropics to treat legitimate memory problems, good/bad thoughts ?
Yes q-tips cause ear wax, so before q-tips were invented ear wax did not exist. It's kind of like how murder didn't exist before guns and violent video games
Things that cost $150 don't make you look rich. Otherwise everyone with any smartphone is rich
Sound Effects? New thing! I don't like it though.
I don’t have airpods. But I always  have my earbuds in, I t helps me stay cool and sometimes helps hmh anxiety. It’s weird tho. Because whenever i take them off the real world sounds weird
Do you want Cybermen? Because this is how you get Cybermen...
Thoroughly enjoyed Greg presenting
Is it bad that in wearing airpods while watching this. Weird flex but ok
• watches while wearing regular ear buds• I feel inferior
who watched this with airpods ? 😂
I soak q-tips in alcohol to clean out my ears. I know its risky but it works. Whenever my ears start to feel gross i just do my thing and it works everytime lol
You guys have no wires on your airpods? Pfft. BROKE. Can't even afford the wires. 🙄
Gregs sassy voice throughout this is prime
This channel has become literal trash
I listen to music for like 7 hours a day RiP
I don't worry because I can't even buy these things.
As I put my AirPods on
* Watches with AirPods *
This is slightly random,  but I feel that I am prone to ear infections, could q-tips cause them?👂
the first asapscience video ive ever downvoted :(
Haha a boy in my class use his AirPod every day on full volume. We say that he need to stop but he never does so the hearing loss will come soon
I don't know what it was about this video but the excessive digression really irritated me. Almost as much as the idiotic design of airpods.
In another video, could you guys possibly discuss if Bluetooth can negatively impact someone’s long term health? Such as air pods or other Bluetooth headphones and how they could have an effect on the brain?
I threw my AirPods away by accident :(
you're so funny lol
Can you do a video on the amount of psychological damage done to the brain if you spend a lot of your time alone. (even if you have many people in you family)
I'm 14 years old and I spend most of my time alone and I would like to know if can damage the brain. 
Thank you 
p.s. I love watching your videos, they help me to learn a lot of science.
Glad I don't have headphones.
best outta the mob
You wont be able to hear the ignorance of conspiracy theorist, duh
I spend a good amount of time at work with my big ol' puffy headphone on.  I'm sure my ears are going to be ruined in a few years.
AsapScience can you make more videos? Oh no they have AirPods in they can’t hear us!
It sounds like there should be more serious warnings for headphones in using them safely. I mostly listen to something while out, like an hour long walk, but also sometimes the duration of work.
3:21 well that's swedish people for ya
RE the first 5 seconds of your video - I've yet to see a single person who owns a pair...
Hah, you think they're airtight at all? Clearly you forget they were cast in an alien's ear.
What about the radiation from wireless earphones? Couldn’t cause at least some kind of harmful mutation?
Then again I loathe apple and I refuse to buy anything from them so unless they come from Android I would not get them
Paranoia levels go up
bold of you to assume i own an airpod
People are here leaving comments before that video is even on 😂
where's my JKN fam at LOL
Say what you will, I use Q-tips, but it's because my earwax gets very bad. So it's kind of needed for me.
Air pods are bad for you done
Wait I can't hear anything.
Ambient noise is on galaxy buds bois! Looks like we are good!
Cheers to your ears! I don't think I'd ever buy airpods. I'd be sure to lose one a year like I lose winter gloves.
...Oops 🤷‍♀️
ok im scared to use mine now
More of a knitpick but in the explaining of the video-sake, I would have prefered if the host wasn't squeezing any slang comments or unneccesary add-ons
Damn, that thumbnail was just gruesome
Gamers wear headsets for almost 7 hours a day in one sitting and then can go on to use AirPods or headphones after
Watching this via AirPods!
I barely sleep withthem
Joke’s on you, I don’t have airpods
Y'all are seriously running out of content
Your bank account will be soon empty. Airpods prevent you from hearing your money leaving your bank account, bECauSe yOu dOn'T sPeaK bRoKe.
5:00 Then the galaxy buds are for you.
Shouldnt it be took out ?
Ha, I own samsung galaxy buds
I like my regular headphones
3:30 hey! that cross on the flag is supposed to be yellow! jk i'm not offended. just a sidenote :)
Lol airpods as a status symbol! 😂
Don’t use q-tips?! What!!!! So there’s a way for my ears to not have earwax if I don’t use q-tips? Why I haven’t heard this before 😭
You sound gayer then I remember
the battery also causes radiation which directly hits the brain.
People with EarPods on for a week:SoRrY I DoNt SpEaK bRoKe
wierless charging is ineficient
I can't hear this video I have airpods
ANDROID FOR LIFE!!! 💯💯💯
its better to put bluetooth in ur ear
Asking the real questions here
Android fo lyfe 😂👍
AirPods doesn’t fit my ears gang where u at
Well then you will not be able to hear anyone, not becuase of the ear damage but the fact that u have airpods!
they wouldn't charge?
him:brain stem


me:...optic nerve...
This guy sounds Soooo guy
You would be deaf from broke
It will run out of battery duhhh.
I..





Don’t own AirPods.....


😑
Jokes on you! I don’t own AirPods 🤑
tbh....the question of mine is....did the guy who ate the earpod still really used it in his ear....?
Soo as long as you listen on a proper decibel level, over the ear noise cancelling headphones are a far superior option beyond any bud forms?
I was listening to this with headphones while watching this...
watching this with my airpods
He clean it to see if it worked. Brah the person is one nasty mothafucka.
This guy talks like James Charles
Its my birthday next week and I asked AirPods but I dont know if i still want them.
Woah I actually just thought about this
He accidentally swallowed AirPods, then you get TGF purposely swallowing them...
they arent common in europe
A lot of people already probably said this but im watching this while wearing airpods.
Who else watched this with AirPods?
1:15 How can Q-tips cause ear wax? The ear wax was there first. Also, I know people who don't use Q-tips and I will never borrow my headphones to them ever again because they look like my Q-tips after not using them for a long time. I love Q-tips and I will use them until I am old and grey.
Dont need this kind of negativity in my life
Who else is watching with AirPods?
Thanks this was really good advice.
Greg is too much. :)
Nice drawing.....
I don’t wear any headphones/air pods
When is Season 2 of Sidenote podcast?
earwax happens whether or not you stick things in your ear...
not a fan of the extra annotation on certain words (i can't think of a better word than extraness) like at 2:50. I feel like it takes away from the content as it's quite distracting. Also what happened to Greg narrating
I haven’t left anything in my ear for a week obviously, but i have an ear infection and saying that i realize i probably should have kept that to myself
making up information just for views
2:34 is it only me or anyone else heard a high pitch note....
&What if you would never take off galaxy buds* , they are super confortable
How do you charge the airpods in your ears
You would definitely bleed?
And I am watching this using airpods
The ultimate flex
2:27 I took out my AirPods
Wait, if you keep ur AirPods in ur head, then don’t u just not put music on?
This happened to me and i am worried. Is it permanent?
Who else is watching this video while wearing airpods? 😂
I now have a fear of AirPods. Thanks!
Who has AirPods 
I
V
Watched this with AirPods
Godd!!! I'm scared now
Disliked for saying, "Hypothet' Situat'..." Actually made me consider suicide.
Guys I have tinnitus (18 years old) trust me don't listen to music with high volume. Now when I'm listenting to music with headphones the volumes is around 50%
Seeing this video on a phone that is cheaper than  earpods ...😅 Anyone else...
i like your voice and i am super turned on
Who else watched this with AirPods in?
i understand this

but teenagers love to have their music really loud
trust me
Lest we forget its Bluetooth. Only one pod receives from the device and transmits to the other pod. Or right through the brain. Maybe that’ll be in an upcoming video, but I doubt brain damage beats top trending
Lmao I'm a Swede and I can relate
anyone else turn down the volume of this video after
You must be really running out of ideas
Stop with all the side jokes in the video
As if I didn't already hate them.
I am on the same zone
😔
2:05 Brilliant plugin easy clap
that outro was adorable lmao
I can't even where air pods my ears are to small
Android gang where you at?
Ehhhh who needs air pods when u have rose gold beats solo3 wireless 😆 but air pods cheaper tho
For answer go to 4:32
I was had headphones on while i watched this
Good job at mentioning tinnitus. 🙄
I already heard about the guy who swallowed his AirPod
Would you use an AirPod that had been through the digestive system?
Look I won’t be awake to watch sadly, but just wanted to say, do you want cybermen? Because that’s how you get cybermen.
2:35 am I the only one that heard that high pitched sound???
Who else here is #androidforever cause I know I am!
W H A T!
Air pods are the new Tidepods
Remember when ASPCA science use to be about things that actually matter? Now it's about air pods. Cool...
Then I'd be bullied by normal people that doesn't think they're entitled to anything..
What if you don't have airpods?
I cant hear you,you too broke for me
I have wireless Headphones not Earphones
Was this video sponsored by Apple? I think headphones and/or earbuds would have been a better term to use.
I don't use air pods and I use my earbuds twice a week for short time periods.
but i legit never remove them
Swear to god at like 0:14, I had to double take at my apple crap xD
Does this work on earphones too or just AirPods?
This comment section:
99% airpod memes
1% others
In a way, infection.
i can’t keep earbuds in for more than five minutes without my ears feeling like they’re going to fall off
Listening on my AirPods lol
Okay i thought this was going to be a little boring vid but the narrator really made it one of the best asap science episodes 😂
lol worth it
This kid at my school purposely ate an airpod and it wasn't even his
You can still use airpods even if you have an android, you would just fall In to the category of not as broke as non airpod users but more broke than airpod iPhone users.
You don't take off AirPods, you take them out. xD
I think my mom has an ear infection from her broken beats, this isn’t a joke.
So her ear is swelling up and this one spot has a bunch of bumps on it, her beats have no cushion so the bumps under the cushion swells her ear.
She says her ear feels really bad. Any chance it’s something from the beats?
#androidsforlife 




Go ahead kill me
You can use airpods on android. But android users have their own version
airpods are not cool
Have they done a study about whether more people switch to earphones because of hearing loss rather than losing hearing from earphones?
Was this just a video without audio?
This all applies to any earbuds
well my hears should be fine because my ears are too small to fit airpods or headphones and it hurts to wear them 😂
Android can still use airpods...
I can't even afford to buy a Iphone
Anybody else listen to this with air pods in?
Who else watched this with airpods lmao
Meanwhile here i am wearing headphones for 12+ hours a day and i get over sensitive ears instead.
Before this i didn't want air pods, now, no chance i will get them at all.
0:15 I thought my iPhone got plugged in
The only one I ever see with Airpods is that one kid in school.
First things first, I wanna just say I love you guys. Explaining science in relatable ways isn't hard. I like this channel because it explains science easily and the videos are almost calming. That's why I generally disliked how this video the voicing was more exciting. Don't get me wrong, you guys are funny and Im a huge fan of the second channel, but I just feel like this channel should be more serious.
You can use airpods with androids
Next video how does asmr work?
You'll be a virgin forever if you don't.
love watching this with my airpods lol
So you’re telling me a man swallowed an AirPod and shit it out and it still worked?
You could never hear us.
Wow I were my beats the entire day at school home sleep and any were I go
I would literally lose those before I got them home .
im just over here like caca poopoo
I prefer how your earlier videos are than this one
I wear earbuds to sleep....
your ears would be blocked from the voices of poor people
What you just did with those few words.. don't do that anymore.
the moment I thought I was early but there's like 100 over comments ...
And that's how bill gates got rich
Am I sensing a lack of ideas?
Still got my wire 😋
I wear headphones for my job all day, I work in a factory and it’s required for us to wear sound protection, and I use noice cancelling headphones which allows me to listen to music for 11 hours a day. Am I gonna lose my hearing?😂🤷🏻‍♀️
Android for life mofo
Is that james charles's voice lol
Listening to this video with Airpods on feels very strange
This is why I am all about the wired headphone life ✌🏼
I shouldn‘t watch this with airpods in my ears😂
2:46 ahbossed
imagine eating an airpod and continuing to use it
And I never used an earphone ever again... but for another reason, the samsung earphone I'm using is too thick, my ears hurt after using it for a while (I've never had this issue before)!
such an apple ad
i use Samsung ear buds.. much better quality and wireless charging
Please do what if we drank juice instead of 2 Litres of water per day. Apparently juice still counts as water intake but I can't imagine its good for you to only drink juice? Or maybe it's fine?
It's a pity there aren't many earbud headphones these days. In-ear 'phones irritate my eardrums, and I find on-ear and over-ear 'phones unwieldy. The most popular earbuds—AirPods and EarPods, ofc—sound crappy imho. The best ones I could get were the JBL T205 (my current one) and Sony STH30.
A Q-Tip with Alcohol takes care of any Ear bacteria or Ear infections.
Who the hell listens to their headphones above 75%? That's just way too loud to be comfortable.
This guy talks a bit too gayly
What if I put it at 74 percent
Shameless plug😂
hell yeah bro android for life
broke has left the chat
hi there! just a small [possible] correction..  do not transducers operate in either direction? (example a speaker becoming a mic or a motor becoming a genny (dynamo)?  I think you meant to say your ears are more of a transmuxer rather than a transducer  (since the ears can't produce sound from impulses from the brain)? of course, I can be completely incorrect here..
*listens to video with AirPods
What about brain tumors
Apple is accelerating wireless charging?
Android for life❤️
Who else is wearing air pods while seeing this video?
Get new background music?
I watched this video with AirPods in
hypebeasts have joined the chat
literally sitting here with my AirPods on
OH NO THEY GOT AIRPODS ON!!
wAIT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO CLEAN MY EARS WITH OTHER THAN Q TIPS
“What if” lol
Watching this where airpods
What would happen if someone was exposed to no sound for a week. Would their hearing stay the same or would it be better?
I dont have airpods
It says stats at 5 not 5:1
Ugh the eardrum burst sound effect made me shudder 🤢
I guess i have to take them off now :/
Lol you’re Hilarious in this!!!!
they’d run out of battery?
nothing about EMF??? disappointing.
Hypoyhec situashhhh
I listened to this video with airpods
I usually only wear them when I go outside.  Eventually,  I do get tired of having them in my ear. Sometimes silence is nice.
Whos watching this with airpods on?🤪
What other weighted dB are there?
Yo sometimes you can’t hear your music on 75% or less. Like on an aeroplane.
Whos listening to this with ear pods
damn this is alarming
U would feel fancy all the time!
What do u do if your phone drops ? Oop
Who else is listening on their AirPods right now?
Fucks up with the intro
But first I need to sell my kidneys.
Ran out of idea huh lol.
#TeamAndriod
I am still going to use airpods 😏
Minecrsft Boots
I would skin my own sister alive to own a pair of airpods.
Ive never even seen or heard of airpods :/
I wonder if wearing earphones causes itching in the intern ear
your ears wont hear broke
haha i'm gonna try listening to nothing but shoegaze and noise rock/noise pop for a month and see if I get tinnitus
I don't have airpods.
Awesome and informative video
ok cool but airpods are earphones not headphones....
Airpods gang?
I like the other guys voiceover better.
WHAT IF YOU NEVER WEAR AIRPODS
Nothing because I don't buy garbage technology
0:15 I  thought that was my phone😂
So, me being poor will save my ears?
I’ll be the coolest deaf person though
Yeah but at least I’m not BROKE
A$ap science
Can't be worse than not taking out your contact's Right RIGHT? ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
I ain't rich
WAIT😶😶😶😶 ....AIRPOD COMES OUT FROM ANUS 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Who is this new guy?
The change in voice makes the video seem weird to me
I listened to this with AirPods...
Forgot to mention the radiation dangers of them
watches video on an android
Who else watching this video with earphone
Never thought that toothbrushes can be so dangerous.
at least ill never smell broke.
Android  4 LIFE!!!!
I’m getting AirPods soon :)
Turns volume down
This made my ears cringe, if that makes any sense
i wrote this comment the second this video premiered i feel proud
But i cannot afford airpods :(
272 airpods uses disliked this video, because their fragile ego is about as easy to break as them.
The funny thing im wearing them while im watching right now....
The funny thing im wearing them while im watching right now....
So TGF shat out their AirPods ahahahahaha
Wait... you guys actually take them off?
🌚 now my ears feel weird 🌚
0:17 i thought my phone got unplugged
airpods are sheep signals
You wouldn’t hear broke
Listening this with airpods
1:18 
WHY.
Can you do a video explaining what happens when you only use 1 ear bud for 8+ hours in the same ear everyday?
Once the battery dies they will become use less
Not a fan of the off topic commentary, unnecessary shortening of words, and zany sound effects.
read the motherboard article "airpods are a tragedy" and spread the message. those ridiculous things are evil incarnated and make you look irritating.
3:23 I think we all know someone like that.
#android4life
im listining to this video with airpods.
I missed it
takes airpods off
a late night snack for sure
The names... all Latin names... god...
wait did that guy poop it out and stuck it back into his ears?
This is basically what i do tho, i do clean them every 2 weeks
So...Who is still using earpods?
Lol androids can use airpods
I have Galaxy buds 😎
Why am I the only one who hates airpods?
Looks like I better start learning sign language.
some kids already know the answer...
Still can't believe that people use those airpods it just looks silly
That charging sound made me check my battery bar
Sorry i didnt hear this video i had my airpods in
7 hours per week is 1 hour per day, if you are awake 16 hours, you get like 4 min for each hour.
Is there a way to ‘heal’ your ear and make your hearing better or are you just screwed for life?
I bet some of my friends will be happy to see this video 😂😂
how do you wash your ears then? any recommendations
Android users unite!!!!
my mom better not see this video
Am i the only watching with airpods?
I've never turned up my music above the fifth lowest setting. It's physically painful above that I don't know how everyone does it
You had me at hypothet situ-aysh!
My son has never used Q-tips he is three he has so much earwax I really don’t think that that’s true
I smell broke
I've never seen these AirPods.
I don’t know why you wouldn’t but ok lol
Im sure that a lot of them are fake airpods
good thing I’m too broke to own any
POOR PEOPLE HAVE LEFT THE CHAT
Soooo are headphones ok?
Don't own airpods just regular headphones, but I've been finding that I do use headphones probably too much, yet for some reason I find that things that used to be fine are now too loud. The tv I turn down to the annoyance of family, my phone is on absolute minimum to produce sound and I still want to make it quieter. I wonder why that is or if i should be worried
You would get cancer
android here too!  f the airpods!
What about gaming headphones
Yayyy
Who here is watching with headphones
Powerbeats pro ad?
How do you eat a airpod
I don't like this thumbnail 😲
What about over ear headphones?
When is sidenote coming back
😂😂😂😂😂
#ad
You guys are running out of ideas
I’m too broke dude...
Sponsored by Apple
Who else is watching with airpods?
People really out here paying more money for less of the product smh
Beats headphones are better.
I kinda did this and it ended very badly
Your talent is wasted
you get surprise yeeted
What do your mean don't use q tips what are we supposed to use
I miss when you guys just stuck to the science the jokes don’t really land
I use them at 25 to 50 % also u can AirPods on Samsung
Why this much hyping?
Why wouldn’t you ever take them off? Eww.
live chat lit rn
That’s why beats solo 3 is the thing!!
You guys should talk about the environmental impact of airpods. They can’t be repaired so they’re likely to end in a landfill at the end of their life, wasting materials
pffff, airpods? what are those?
you would be deaf, dum dum, DUUUH
Android master race
Welp I’m deft
takes off her airpods
That was really great
They need to stick to the science lingo
this is just bull***t
... how do you get it from your ear... to your mouth
This is an ad
I wonder who has AirPods on right now while listening to this.
watches in airpods well crap
Jabra elite better
I just love music to much
HumanPods
what about normal earphones with the wires?
Sorry but ear wax is not made from taking things in and out of your ears... its something that your body generates and is naturally moved by the skin and hairs within your ear canal. Everyone is different though so the AMOUNT that people produce is different, sometimes even between their own two ears!
Sorry, what did you say?
😂😂😂
I can’t hear you
Yeah I do see this shit everywhere hope they get lost
Is it the same for headphones? I mean... You are not actually inserting it into your ears, so i guess infection will not be a problem?  But i guess you'll still be experiencing hearing loss... Right?
Android for life!
video around tinnitus next time?
please stop making worthless videos :/
Hate whoever voiced this
Yumilicious!
Why does it feel so nice when you are wearing headphones then your ears get hot but then all the air comes to them? Also I can't even get ear pods to stay in my ears and I never wear headphones so, No hearing loss warning for me!
Who’s listening to this with AirPods?
Get fake airpods on wish for 4 bucks
Who else is watching this with AirPods
Bizzare screeching at 1:55
they wouldn’t fall out
I’m watching with AirPods!!
That’s why my ears always ring
They don't fall out
Premiere in 4 mins
What's with the sound effects?
Only The supreme can like this comment. Or who has airpods. Well im wearing it now. Me no spoke no broke.
I am a little confused, you kept switching between the name of headphones and earphones and I am wondering if the booth affect the ears in the same way? One touches your ear and the the other is spaced out with less noise pollution due to a seal around the ear.
wopwop sweden
What happened to the other guy?
Jabra gang here
what' up with all the awkward infections
I disliked this because i don't like the way you talk about things. stop it, please.
what about bluetooth signals ?
welp ima stop going to sleep with my airpods on cause i don’t wanna accidentally eat it
What if money didn't exist
I’m watching this while wearing AirPods
I mean. The lithium battery dies within a year and it’s irreplaceable so....
Kids think airpods are so expensive because their parents only give them like $10 a week. If you can afford an iphone, airpods are cheap in comparison. They're about as much as any other quality headphones on the market rn.
Will air pod cause cancer?
Sorry, cant hear br- anything
What?
Is headsets any better?
I can’t get the darn things to stay in my ears! It’s always been a problem with any earbud-type item, so I’m a headphone user. I do wear them a lot, but I live in New York, so a lot of the time I’m not even listening to anything—I just don’t want people to talk to me on the street. :P
watches this with airpods in
I am super attached to mine and yeah I have gotten 2 ear infections and multiple little sores from keeping them in too much. I am doing better in the past six months after I went on a short headphone detox but this info should really be more widely known so a dumb teenager (me) never spends 10+ hours a day with airpods in.
you eat them
The infection thing is true, I have left my headphones in at night a lot, and I have gotten swollen areas that when pushed against hard enough released pus and contaminated liquid. It’s disgusting.
Who is watching this video with earpods on and volume at 1 cause it hurts your ears?
Is this an ad?
Don't try this at home kids!...or anywhere
Your ears would oof
.I.
This video is trying so hard to be relevant
RICH PEOPLE PROBLEMS!
You’ll be as cool as 0 kelvin
Great video guys.. Thanks
Who's watching with Airpods ?
What would happen if you never had airpods to put on in the first place?
Airpods look stupid.
I'm 15,639th person to watch this..... so proud
I slept listening to music on  earpords last week and when I woke, I heard random words that whole day
Who’s watching this while wearing Airpods?
My ear buds arnt like the white ones  there black and have rubber
Dislike for "hypothet situashe"
Hi
Hi
I don't like cancer buds
Cringe
What does asap mean
I do not care what people say, Airpods are sooooooo ugly
death
0:48
I’m watching this with my AirPods
When did he get so sassy?
Who’s else is watching this with AirPods
I Have A Question For You Guys Why is the poop of a bird White in Colour where as the other animals may have yellowish shade
Who else is watching this with airpods?
Who is watching this with AirPods?
They look stupid no offence
nasty
I’m sitting here watching this with AirPods in my ears
Who’s also watching this video with airpods in ?
Sorry but the arbitrary shortening of words is cringey
Cant you use normal English?
Who is this guy where are the other guys?
Countdown
I heard something about the Bluetooth radiation of airpods being able to cause cancer... Is that true? Plz help
They would die...
Gayest video ive seen in a while.
Some of these sound effects you guys used was cringey tbh. It sounded like you got them off a free website or something.
the airpods would die and you wouldn’t be able to hear music anymore. None of this would happen because the battery life is around 3 hours or less
Ohh
How did the airpod go from ear to mouth???
EWWWW DISGUSTING but lit
Such a f@ggy voice
Lol
ear wax is produced when objects are put in and out of your ear... seriously? ear wax is constantly produced by your ears. If you don't try to use anything to remove it it will simply fall out of your ears in tiny tiny bits. Block the ear canal and where will this wax go to huh?
This video sucks!!!
Ja!
Hey dude, don't swallow your Air Pods!
oH nO, hE cAn'T hEaR uS, He HaS aIr PoDs In!

EDIT: Thank you, Mitch! I'm on Android too!
who’s watching this with their ears?
Ay I’m rich
You’d go deaf
So glad I am watching this video without using a headset/airpods.  I love Android.  lol
I HATE APPLE DEAL WITH IT
You should do one on EMF radiation given off by these types of headphones/airbuds (wireless)
#androidsquad
Ew
Transddduucer
ios sucks
My friend gave me AirPods for my birthday I don’t even use them lol
Just cut off apple ear bud cords and you have air pods (that don't work)
So... You can eat AirPods and have them come out completely fine?!

Now that’s a high-quality product!
Why not Galaxy buds
Sut up
I’m in the 17-25%😅 In my defense, it’s because of work.
Hearing loss or killing myself? Hmmm... 

Yeah, I'll keep listening to music I love and watch videos I like.
I bet u lije the word anus
When you realize you can’t afford AirPods
Future video idea: EXPLAIN PLASMA PLEASEEE
Airpods sucks.  Theres cheaper better quality headphones with better sound, longer lasting and still wireless!
If your never took airpods out of your ears it's charging will get low
Haha airpods SUCK!!! I use Bluetooth gamer headphones with big ear cushions.
I see this is why valve is using air for their new headphones for the index
Why are people disliking or liking before the video is premiered? This is why reviews cannot be taken seriously. Watch before you share your misguided opinions...
Who’s watching this with AirPods? 🤔🤔🤔
Good content but why are you narrating like that? This ain't the Disney Channel...
EW ANDROID
Hmmmmmmm.....THATS WHAT A LIZARD WOULD SAY!!!!1!!
Coincidences: exists
Shane Dawson: must be the illuminati
That vídeo is a conspiracy against conspiracies, so watch out
Conspiracy theory: we are being brainwashed by conspiracy theories
Coincidence: exists

This video was made by the illuminati shadow lizard people. Stay woke.
0:15 his hat looks suspiciously like the logo of illuminati 🤔🤔😱
7/11 was part time job
I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but behind these guys there are a bunch of maps. I think this is a sign they want to dominate the world...
Broke: lizard people are controlling America
Woke: Lizard people are controlling America, but mole men are controlling Russia, as part of an intergalactic proxy war
This video could be a conspiracy itself. It persuades me to not believe in conspiracy theories and that’s what the GOVERNMENT WANTS!!!

This doesn't dismiss the fact that conspiracies are real things that actually happen.

Sure, far-fetched conspiracies are harmful. But the word "conspiracy theory" has become dismissive. Someone could make a logical deduction from facts, but all someone has to do is call it a "conspiracy theory" and said person loses all credibility.

There's two different ways of looking at this problem.
Plot Twist: ASAP Science landed on the moon in 1869

Me: Coincidence !!!!!!! I THINK NOT!!!!!
"This video is sponsored by your government."
But hey, thats just a theory, a CONSPIRACY THEORY!!!
I do think that conspiracy theories can be dangerous especially antivax. You should not believe things without solid evidence most of the time. But to play devils advocate some of these theories (very rarely) are actually true. For example MK ULTRA started off as a conspiracy theory and was later proven true. This makes it hard to know what to believe for many people. Still though I would also like to say I have gotten plenty of vaccines and I'm still fine so please don't believe the antivax theories.
Sounds like a conspiracy to convince us there's no conspiracy. I'm on to you!!!
Me * feels dumb *
Dog *exists *
Also me “ Ha I’m smarter than youu”
There are conspiracy theories that are not harmful, but interesting and worth discussions! Like aliens, I love watching everything related with that topic!
I feel like the Stranger Things theme should have been played in the intro  XD
I love how as I'm watching this there's a Shane Dawson Conspiracy theory video underneath 😂
Imma watch that later
People have nothing better to do , including me .
*sees thumbnail*
Me: is that Bill Cipher?!
Is this a conspiracy on conspiracy theory?
As someone with several conditions that are sensitive to certain sounds and lights I did not enjoy the intro including the ASAPscience wiggle bit. By time the video started proper I felt a bit nauseous and as if a seed of a migraine has been planted. 
Just one of your long-time viewers expressing his opinion on the opening! I still love your vids.
(edit: Oh, I also kind of miss the old format of the whiteboard and disembodied hand with you chaps popping up IRL at the end cards XD still personal preference just so you know what one of your audience thinks <3 )

I picked heads. Damn I'm dumb
oh yes, just toss conspiracies to the side and never take a closer look at them, they are just for loons. Its not like the government would ever spy on journalists and pay them off to publish propaganda... oh wait operation mockingbird turned out to be real. Ha well some loons think a big company is trying to suppress the fact their product causes life threatening cancer... huh well, in the 1950's tobacco companies did just that.  well only idiots would believe the CIA was capturing people and trying to mind control them... oh, MK-ULTRA did just that... 


This video should have mentioned that it's wise to actually look into the research that conspiracy's claim before just dismissing them. Vaccines have a proven track record and are one of the most important scientific/medical discoveries leading to uncountable lives saved, and no scientific study has linked them with autism. You can measure the CO2 concentration in the air and we have plenty of studies showing how CO2 can trap heat in our atmosphere.
What about the Muelllar conspiracy theory. That the voting matchines were hacked.
.what about  conspiracy theories that turned out to be true.
Intelligent people know that the news has blatantly lied to them on multiple occasions.  



Conspiracies continue conspiring
Hello to ASAP science 
Me: watch’s video
whispers this video is sponsored by the USA government 
Me: wait wat 
Keep searching for truth folks.
This video is fundamentally wrong as per the message being sent, apart from the scientific explanations. 
A little premise, no, I'm not an Antivaxxer, I don't believe in Reptilians, Illuminati ecc.
I just think that we should never let our guard down, which means that we should always be critical about what we are reading, because behind journals and the press there is money, so basically people with power and as a consequence there might be interests to protect. Corruption, also, plays a big role and it's not as irrelevant as you might expect in well developed countries.  
I just want everybody to remind that, yes, taking everything we are told as true is not the solution, but this holds true even if we are taking in consideration the most reliable sources, because we are not living in a perfect world where everything works perfectly and where we are always being told the whole unfiltered story . 
Always re-elaborate, interpret, think and criticize what you are reading.
Maybe the head of YouTube or the government told ASAP science to make this video so people would more likely disbelieve in  conspiracie theory’s😱😱
You two are part of the problem. You haven't debunked anything.
But this video doesn't address the fact that some Conspiracy Theories are blatantly true!
It just blindly assumes ALL are false.
Well I mean  this is a dumb question because like all theories there's a possibility that it's true. Also it's foolish to think everything is just what seems.
4:12 conspiracy theory #517: dopamine is actually the Illuminati reprogramming your brain🤔
So these were just conspiracy theories of conspiracy theories, nice.

Amazing video by the way🙃
The real question is ,how much were you paid by 23andme ???
finshes watching video about conspiracy theories

Ad for Energy Healing starts
My conspiracy theory is that Shane Dawson is a robot
Conspiracies were created by the Illuminati to make us question everything instead of actually getting anything done, thus halting our progress and making it easier for them to control us.
Why should anyone believe you fools when you literally push the government's beliefs?

Can you make your videos more scientific and less politically biased? Regards, a scientist.
The Earth is a cube. I believe in this. 






A joke
It's worth to add, that some conspiracy theories actually turn out to be true. Conspiracy theories aren't necessarily per default bad, but they sure can be.
"WE" fall for conspiracy theories???? Speak for yourself!
Alex Jones and Paul J. Watson are Triggered!
If you don't feel the need to question beyond what you are told you're far from being a scientist
The illuminati is a triangle, pyramids are also triangles there is also a triangle on the dollar bill
The government is using triangles to spy on us
Some conspiracies were true, but, they had evidences for it.. not youtube videos as "proofs". LOL
WHAT HAPPENED TO CAM AND EMILY FROM THAT ONE VIDEO??!!!??????  AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT REMEMBERS that???
Just ask yourself questions dont trust 100% what the media says
I love a good conspiracy theory! 😁👍
I think the boys were at KOLKATA (INDIA) see at the back.. 
3:39
Fantastic video, well done :-)
My dad went to get almond milk a couple days ago didn’t come back.
1) just an increase of dopamine does not help us understand how it works
2) what happened to your mic
3) 6:00 science rarely proves. It disproves, it's a totally fundamental principle, that doesn't seem reflected
4) 5:05 why... why the intonation and melodramatic facial expression... it's so distracting
You said global warming is real, well I say Chuck-E-Cheese Pizza is recycled, change my mind.
Right.... But the earth REALLY IS FLAT!!
A video talking about conspiracy theories.... that looks like a conspiracy theory against conspiracies :'D It's:
1. Finding patterns (on how conspiracies are designed)
2. Talking about how big social media is spreading these conspiracies for their own benefit.


This is so meta


(I'm joking - I appreciate all AsapSCIENCE videos <3)
I don't believe in any conspiracy theories...





(Only exception:game theory)
The reason people believe in conspiracies is simple, it gives them a sense of identity and Community with the people who also believe it. It also makes them feel in the know which is attractive especially to people who don't know very much.. It's really that simple.
  I don't buy into the safer option theory, that doesn't fit the reason why people stick with these things. It's more deeply psychological than just instinct

That said, there are many real conspiracies out there. Thousands of them. But people don't want to hear about the little ones they want to talk about aliens and moon landings because it's more exciting.
 ( and.... I used to believe in some of them, but I have also had at least two different videos made about me showing my face supposedly shapeshifting into a reptilian. It's a long story but I was teasing somebody who thought I was an Illuminati agent and they took it way too seriously)
Because a lot of them turn out to be "conspiracy facts"
Why aren't the top YouTube videos being recommended videos like "bringing a typewriter to class" and "Phineas and Ferb in Japanese"? 🤔🤔🤔
I think there's a balance there because yeah, you shouldn't just blindly believe something because it COULD make sense but also you shouldn't blindly believe that EVERY theory is wrong. I think you just need to look at the data and decide for yourself what to believe. Most conspiracy theories are probably wrong but there could be some data in some of them to take into account but not necessarily believe the conclusion that they came up with. There's a balance of thinking outside the box and blindly believing everything you hear (whether for the theory or against it)
Love the idea 💡 of the  video 🎥 so much BIG FAN FROM SAUDI ARABIA 🇸🇦

5:31 Sooo...... what you’re saying is that the measles outbreaks have nothing to do with the (known) weekly influx of thousands of illegal immigrants from 3rd world countries at our southern border. Give me a break, wake up people. 

There’s obviously bias shown in this video. Guaranteed ASAP Science has some sort of ties to George Soros or the Democratic Party.
You guys forgot to mention that some conspiracy's are true
A major culprit is the mainstream media. They're responsible for anti-vax and other awful conspiracies. Their lust for views has made them untrustworthy and they poison even science they report on.


Distrust in the mainstream media is the main catalyst for a lot of people. When the media is wrong or intentionally misconstrued something for views they encourage people to find alternative sources. Global warming is heavily supported by mainstream media so its legitimacy is tainted by "technically not lying" political hit pieces, opinionated talking points on a channel that is supposed to be a source of information and other tactics.  Getting rid of sources of conspiracy theories enables rules and laws that may eventually impede the truth eventually or even oppress people while also not fixing a damn thing and legitimizing the conspiracy theory. 


Not to mention how political science can be. "problematic studies" are often suppressed, stopped or anyone who looks into them are kicked out of society. Science is no longer trustable due to a growing gatekeeping force that has a specific agenda. There will always be conspiracies but building trust and weeding out the biased in mainstream media and science ensures that the conspiracies will grow out of control.
Ok and how tf do i know that this isn't a conspiracy theory
1:05 sounds like the opening of the space-time Vsause 3 video
I totally feel like the government is hiding aliens 😂💁👽👾🧞‍♀️🛸
What about the MKUltra Project? And the Gulf of Tonkin Incident? They were both wacky conspiracy theories before, and as it turns out, they were all true. Not coincidentally, they were both related to horrifying war crimes committed by the US. When it comes to historical facts, but the evidences are potentially classified (I'm thinking of the 9/11 attacks, for example, and the sketchy explanations that followed it), you can't treat any doubt to it as a conspiracy theory, and dismiss the doubt. If there is even a small chance that your own government allowed such a crime to happen, you have to investigate it to the bones.


Calling it a "conspiracy" and dismissing the doubt as a joke is just stupid.
Theory: what if you are saying this so we stop believing the truth.
OK I am late to the convo here, but feel it is worth noting the big missing thing in this.


The reason conspiracy theories work, is because there is historical conspiracies littering the entire existence of civilization.


Since humans started organizing in hierarchical societies there have been conspiracies. They are an ever present FACT of human life. 



It is a massive disservice to everyone to just out of hand dismiss conspiracies. Because they haven't gone away due to us being alive at this time. There are still conspiracies, and even popular opinion is often a conspiracy theory. For example, the official 911 story is a conspiracy theory. Time and time again people will plot for their own benefit against the rest of us. Corporations are constantly conspiring against their consumers to make higher profits.


What has changed is how conspiracies and those who research them are branded as completely insane for researching them. While yes, some conspiracy theories are absurd there are still a lot of theories that are not out of reasonable thinking.


For example, back in the early 90's. I was called a conspiracy theorist for telling people about Climate Change. At that time it was considered fringe and not enough scientific data. Now it is common knowledge. 



But now I am considered a conspiracy theorist because of legitimate concerns about vaccines. Not that they cause autism, but that over 4 billion dollars has been paid out by the US government for people injured and killed due to vaccines. Vaccine supporters don't want to admit there are legitimate concerns about vaccines. They want to blanket stereotype people as idiot anti-vaxxers. But they have not done the due diligence to discover there really is issues.


I don't call myself a conspiracy theorist, but a conspiracy researcher. I do more debunking of idiot conspiracies than promoting legit conspiracies. But the reality is there is real conspiracies out there. The orthodoxy and powers that be just have gotten better at placating the masses into disbelieving when the conspiracies are unveiled.
Conspiracy theory would not exist if it was not based on truth. And truth is always hidden in thick layer of shadows.
"Maybe a thank goodness moment, this video came at #InMyLife" 😉 ✌️❤️
So YouTube demonitizes videos and places “truth bars” on videos. Who is watching the watchmen? Free speech platform?
Not saying the Chuck e cheese one is definitely real....but if all those pictures are legitimate then it's totally possible.
GREAT VIDEO! Hahaha, I LOVE the eye roll!!! "OBVIOUSLYYYYY"
From a sample of 111 most recent conspiracy videos .
 Ten u. s. links were found  in 77 of them..with 66% of those having a view count  that contained either a  prime number or were divisible by 2 and sometimes 3.
 Many had comments that showed a bias to the consonant "Q" and a lot featured cats being cute.


Conclusion - possible manipulation of figures by the New World Order disguised as random coincidences
- Simple science folks !!
The study continues.
      ;-)
Conspiracy theories have traction because so called authorities fail to answer peoples question and concerns about certain events or people , just take a look at the impossible 911 commission report I would like to see ASAP science agree with that report using science .
buildings don't fall at near free fall speed if there is intact structure below .
Let's do a video on propaganda . conditioning and manipulation ruining the world .
There is a huge difference between critical thinking and being taken for a ride by a you tuber .
Wanna end the vaccine debate nationalize all vaccines remove them from the profit motive as it is the drug companies and government collusion that people don't trust .
What if Asap Science is manipulating us to believe that conspiracy theories manipulate us and this video is a conspiracy theory about conspiracy theories?
So asapscience, I definitely said tails for the fourth flip.
nobody:
Shane: must be illuminati
Mitch: 50% of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory
UFOs: Allow us to introduce ourselves
Maybe if our politicians, big pharma and media didn't have such a shocking track record of immoral behavior people wouldn't seek to formulate alternative truths.

Also, talking about "emotionally charged misinformation' then showing segments of vice "news" really isn't supporting your "unbiased" research.
Shane Dawson has left the chat





I’m sorry
This was really good content!  Worth the wait :)
I looked in the recommended after watching this video to find a ton of clickbait titles about “mysterious islands” and stuff like that.

Just sayin...
Most of them are a symptom of depression.
AsapSCIENCE telling us all about the conspiracy theory conspiracy lol.
A conspiracy theory about conspiracy theories
William Shakespeare was a pseudonym for multiple writers who were unable to write under their own name for political or sexist reasons. 
That is my one conspiracy theory.

Creators: Uploads entertaining conspiracy theory video
YouTube: We don't do that here
i love this crossover!!! please more 😍
4.9 billion years ago, in a dark volume of "infinite" space, there was a big bang. Particles of matter and anti-matter collided and the remaining matter particles were compressed together with gravity to create the planet we walk on, the sun, other stars in the sky, and other countless things in the universe. Okay?

Now, imagine you're standing in an open field, and a tornado forms. You cannot escape it, the only way to get rid of it is to let the tornado S U C C you up, and spit you back out at the top. Anything that goes into a tornado normally cannot escape the pull, and is always spat out somewhere in another point in space at a different time.

So... what if BLACK HOLES worked the same way? Only... the other end of the black hole isn't in the universe we know of, but in a parallel universe. The matter being deconstructed by the black hole in universe one, is being spat out and re-constructed into new matter in universe two; The other end of the black hole--that scientists know nothing about (yet)--is creating another "big bang" cycle like the one we ultimately originated from 4.9 billion years ago.


I want my royalties if my theory is correct... 500 years from now when humans develop the technology to actually jump into a black hole and survive the violent spaghettification to tell the story back home.

good to know

damn
I believe in so many conspiracies omg I'm so dumb
“Studies have shown that more than 50% of Americans…”

Me: hahah, silly Americans, o no güey?
5:05 Honestly, you don’t deserve a dog
This is orderly to the chaos of our believes to the conspiracy this is a theory
The only theory I believe in are THATS JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY.
I liked conspiracies as a kid as well. they play into emotional patterns of that are similar to how you feel (like powerlessness and insecurity), but in the end, they are the ultimate emotional test out there. 


I've found that conspiracies that make me feel bad (for example global warming) are not to be paid much attention to, because they feel bad (things that feel bad is your indicator that your perception is off about it). however, there are a lot of conspiracies that also turn out to be true as well -- and for me those have a slightly different feeling to them. they feel like they are right, and then afterward, if I think about the consequences of that conspiracy, again I might feel bad,  but it's not really bad. my perception of the consequences are what is causing the bad feeling.


so, there are (for me) two phases to the emotional response to a conspiracy which I've noticed: the feeling whether the conspiracy is valid, and then the feeling that comes as a response to my perception of the consequences.

---


for example, vaccines are causing autism. to me, it feels likely, but I see that as a good thing, because I don't perceive autism as a bad thing. I think the common perception that autism is a bad thing causes a lot of emotional distress, because they're perceiving the natural evolution of the human species as something unwanted -- instead of perceiving the reason why the evolution is beneficial (who knows, maybe autism people may be really really really good at creating things with a brain interface :P)


another example is global warming: to me it feels kinda valid. the idea that humans are causing it feels invalid, and the idea that carbon is causing it also feels invalid. next, the perceived consequence of that global warming is this huge threat that we're powerless to stop feels quite bad because it plays right into the emotion of powerlessness that most people have. instead, we should welcome the changing environment of our planet and find a way exist in an environment which is changing. it's sort of like puberty for the planet. it would be just as difficult to try and reverse the effects of puberty on a person
Y'all threw some serious shade in this video. God dang.
Simulation theory??? Elon musk has said there is a one in a billion change this is reality . I don't know whether I believe most conspiracies . But even still I think it's good to have an open mind and also to think about what's going on around us and not just believe what we are told. They are also fun 😂😂
5:00 He flashes the white supremacist symbol 👌. Woke generation is gonna be so pissed and call for a ban on this account 😂 🙀❄️
We have a second Blue Short Kid In Asap Science!!! The YOUTUBE ALGORITHM!!
9/11 was no conspiracy theory, it was a false flag attack, by the united states.
I'm not the conspiracy type. I think, comprehend, decide for myself. I developed an idea about a subject that turned out to be a conspiracy theory. So, for all intents and purposes i'm a conspiracy theorist.

The edit was a swipe typing mistake. Don't get conspiratorial about it... 🙂
Y2K Is a theory and my dad's friend's grandfather who spent about 30000 on generators, fuel for years, water and food for years just to find out it didn't happen
The government paid you for this huh
The flaw in conspiracies is that they are all focused on the u.s.a.
mainstream media has been pushing a conspiracy theory for years :|
It's scary how early I am! (I'm like two hours late tbh 😂😅
avril lavigne has definitely been replaced by a body double. the facts are right there people
2:25
I wanted to point something out because I came to a realization that I was hoping maybe if I share it it will help others come to that conclusion as well. I used to be of the opinion that despite the fact that previous coin flips have no bearing on what your current coin flip's chances are, you could still take the picture as a whole and realize that if you were to flip a coin 4 times, the chance of all 4 landing heads would be 1 in 16, so it is somewhat unlikely that you would get a quadruple head coin flip, and thus the 4th flip still has a higher probability of landing tails. 

However, this line of thinking neglects to consider that every single outcome of 4 coin flips has the same chance as landing 4 heads, so heads, tails, tails, heads has the same chance (1 in 16) as 4 heads (or 4 tails for that matter), so flipping a coin 4 times and landing 4 heads has the same chance (1 in 16) of occurring as flipping a coin 4 times and landing 3 heads and a tails (also 1 in 16 chance), so a 4th tails landing is just as likely to occur as a 4th heads landing, netting out to 50/50 once again.
My gut reaction to Shane Dawson has always been ugh. Now I know why. He spreads rumors, lies & misinformation. What a creep.
I thought YouTube banned any conspiracy videos. 
Why isn't it mistakenly banning this one?
Everyone says Alex Jones is conspiracy theory’s but  what about bohemian grove

Imo conspiracy theories are great writing and creativity fuel, and in the same vein so are phenomena like deja vu and the Mandela effect.
This video was so ussless im scare about future of yt
Yea great let a company decide what you see and don't rather then an algorithm that just picks what you want to see. Great idea sure that won't backfire
Love you AsapSCIENCE! nic vid as always
What?  You think conspiracy theories are something new?  People are inventing totally baseless explanations for everything that exists every minute of every day.  "All politicians are corrupt" is the leading conspiracy theory of the day and it's been around for thousands of years before YouTube was even dreamed of.  Conspiracy theories are what people do when they don't know what the hell they're talking about--which is probably most of the time.
The 50% statistic is pretty legit. I personally believe that Amelia Earhart was abducted by aliens.

But what if the conspiracy theory is true? Please comment!
CONSPIRACY THEORY a term invented if I can that but definitely coined by the C I A    and implemented to DELETE PUBLIC INTEREST in the anomalies in the narrative and media propaganda owned by a handful of super rich and powerful people.
This is done by REPETITION  by the media and is obvious once one's eyes have been opened. Tragic for the well being of society.
Absolutely moronic.








With love!
When i thought conspiracies couldn’t be proved by science 😂
It was Adam Smith who said that if you see two businessmen speaking then they're conspiring against the public. 
There is also a joke in Britain that what you call conspiracies, MP's call lunch.

It has got to the point where if you try to show how people in power are making secret decisions for nefarious reasons that you are dismissed as being some raving conspiracy theorist who is no different to a man obsessed with alien puppeteers. This is a regrettable trend.
I think don't believe in medical or global warming theories but I don't know what's going on with time travel and the moon stuff
can you do a video on scientific tips for learning a language?
11th commemttt
You guys did a great job with this one!
I'll watch things like this and YouTube will recommend me travel videos
Step 1: Collect underpants.
Step 2:
Step 3: Profit.
Is it okay for me to be circumcised because im only 11
some conspiracies have come true so just keep an open mind
Why do I see Bill Cipher in the thumbnail?
To call it a conspiracy theory undermines the definition of conspiracy alone
Make a video about Deja Vu!
what if all these theories weren’t going to happen in the first place and Shane just gave them these genius ideas to actually do it... and then later we say we were right about the theories even though we weren’t and it was Shane’s public videos that pulled the trigger to this 😱😱😱😱🤔🤔🤔🤔🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐


Oh no
Patriarchy theory is one good example.

Here's how you know a conspiracy theory, check for yourself.
If it cannot be proven, aka "not even false" it's one if it involves a conspiracy.
If it's contradictory, aka "not even false" and it involves a conspiracy it's one.
If it goes against observable evidence, aka "provably false" and it involves a conspiracy then it's one.
If it relies on "gut feelings", "claims of authority", "emotional appeal" and other falacies besides it involving a conspiracy then it's one.
2:47 here I was 30 seconds ago thinking I was so smart
What defines an opaque object, and how do humans translate opacity to our eyes? I've really been thinking about that for a long time.
Preface: Not trying to tell you how to run your channel and don't wish to ever do so. This stuff takes a lot of work for you and I appreciate the effort that goes into it! That being said:


I kind of miss when AsapScience was more animation and explanation than more references to pop culture or getting an ego boost from recognizing yourself as more intelligent than you dog. The cutesy attitude detracts from the informational standing of the video in my opinion. I may be unique in this observation, but wanted to share because that's what comment sections are for.


By any means, I've loved this channel for YEARS and love to see the continued success it's been. Still plan to watch new videos as they come out. :) All the best! <3
I absolutely disagree with coin example, from basic statistics, the chance of getting heads for the 4th time in a row is 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5, that is getting heads on the first throw AND on the second AND on the third AND on four, which is clearly lower than the complementary (1 - p) of getting tails. Nothing related to conspiracy theories.
Not relevant to the video, but where did Greg get his glasses? 👀
prob is, just because something is labelled a conspiracy theory doesn't make it unworthy of investigation. The ancient civilizations stuff in particular can present very compelling arguments if you take the time to look beyond the "aliens" meme. You just never know until you look at it with an open mind...
I really liked the way you started this video it was really engrossing. I feel like you guys took this up a notch. 

Though I do find it interesting that you are always giving statistics on America and not Canada. As an American, I agree that America is strife with conspiracy theories, I am surrounded by them everyday. 

You quoted the anti-vac theory and the disbelief in climate change. But, honestly, most Americans avoid those topics on a day to day basis because people get angry ... and nobody wants yet another blood bath ... The most common conspiracy theories that get around without a fist fight or a pulled gun are:

1. Expiration dates on products are prematurely dated by big companies to get you to throw away old product you may have and get you to go buy more. 

2. During Halloween you must check all of your children’s candy to make sure that there are no injection holes or razor blades present.

3. Big brother is watching (the belief that the government is watching and recording everything we do - which is further perpetuated by the marketing algorithm sharing between Facebook, Amazon and Google)

The scariest conspiracy theories aren’t the ones people argue passionately about... they are the more pervasive ones that everybody believes without question....
they work because they're true haha sheeple, this video can't possibly be worth the watch
Stevie wonder isn’t blind.
And this is why we have an epidemic of measles in NYC. *headdesk*
I completely understand the dangers behind misinformation conspiracy theories, but I think discouraging them in general presents a dangerous mindset to hold. What happens to freedom of speech and expression if you condemn all talk of conspiracies? What about conspiracy theories that have actual evidence and merit behind them, such as the oligarchical nature of capitalist governments, who have been shown in studies to only take input from constituents instead of citizens, and almost promote wealth disparity?
Or the ideas behind policies like the wars on drugs and terror, which were constructed for ulterior motives such as radicalization or profit agendas?
Something like "follow the evidence, follow the money, double check your sources, and think critically" would be better than "conspiracies are dangerous". That sounds really emotionally exploitative to my ears.
Anthropological climate change is supported by at least 11 separate studies in the past two decades, denying it is supported by strawmen and gas companies, so conspiracy dismissed. 
America creates artificial enemies to polarize the masses to depose regimes and steal resources is supported by: the middle East and South America have oil, oil is a very sought after resource, and wars are almost always motivated by resource or monetary accrual, so conspiracy not dismissed.
I'm not saying conspiracies shouldn't be debunked when they're held together by nothing but a few artificial strings, but there are some out there that I could very easily see being suppressed for no other reason than that it serves a multibillion dollar profit saving agenda.
I think aliens - life in some far place in the universe isn't just conspiracy theory, it's seriously science theory... Einstein believed this, Hawking believed this and i'm believing too
Stories don't have to be true to be believed. They just have to be told. And I tell that one a lot
Conspiracy theories give me something spooky and odd to believe I love them
Conspiracy theory : that brain at 1:56 has the mouth on the incorrect side...




Or does it 
:o
I think it's the opposite, most people are quick to say that conspiracies are fake without being able to confirm it. I think it's healthy to questions things and not believe everything you're told.
i loved the music and editing for this video!!!
I like the biological explanation. Still does not mean that some things touted now as conspiracy theories my not have some truth.
So what you're saying is that because I don't fall for the BS conspiracy theories like Dawson's im too trusting?
1:48 ok oops you step on it it bites you now you're dead  too much information for my brain
Good video, but the next one should be: "Conspiracy theories that turned out to be true."
Very interesting, there are also a lot of social factors helping spread conspiracy theories: if I live in an environment where everyone believes to a conspiracy theory, I am brought to believe it to be accepted in that environment.
Moreover, as it has just been said, a conspiracy theory gives me something to believe and a sense to lots of things that has no sense or meaning at all  and this  is more comforting. It is more comforting that someone obscure and very powerful controls  your life(Gods or obscure societies are the same in lots of aspects)than the fact that your life depends also on random events.
It is more comforting believe that JFK has been killed by a conspiracy instead of a mad man( Reagan was almost like to be killed like Kennedy but since he wasn’t there’s no such conspiracy on him).
Eventually believe in a conspiracy gives you the emotion of being part of the 1% who knows all, the sensation of being different from all the other people around you, in summary, the sensation of being unique and not one of 7 billion people in the world.
What motivates one to ostracise a belief as a “conspiracy”. An effective tactic nonetheless.
This is also a conspiracy theory😂😂
Okay, in all seriousness, he sounds a little different in this, and the music is definitely different, it's not just stylistic, someone is probably behind this
Got my unfollow for this one keep going sheeples...
cosponsor, this video have been made by vsauce
Plot twist: WE ARE ALL LIZARDS AND THE THINGS WE THINK ARE LIZARDS ARE ALIENS
But the cuts don't line up!
It doesn’t matter whether people believe in global warming or not when they still drive SUVs and use lots of electricity. But I guess they’re WoKe
You’re just working for the man
Conspiracy the-
clicks
The only conspiracy theory I've ever believed in (aside from a general mistrust of governments) was that the Hillsborough Disaster was caused by police negligence and abuse of power, and subsequently covered up  by the UK police forces.

Eventually, 27 years after the event, the inquest into the disaster proved the conspiracy to be real, so that was gratifying. I can only imagine what it meant to the families of the 96

I guess what I'm saying is that I think a big part of the appeal of conspiracy theories is that conspiracies do actually exists, and those in power very often  want to lie to and manipulate the public. I don't know if I'll ever really be able to understand the thought process behind the really batshit ones, though...
I have an alternative view = conspiracy theory
OMGThat  is EVERYTHING (3:10)
Conspiracies are entertaining to listen to, but believing in most of them is a bit of a stretch. Some are just crackpot.
Some things are true and some are not. Truth is nobody cares until it directly effects them.
I love how the editing style was directly taken from Shane without even trying to hide it
A conspiracy is a misdeed involving more than one person.
A theory is a plausible explanation for something.
Of course those performing the misdeeds want to dissuade you from finding them out.
You need to clarify global warming.  The "hoax" is not claiming it isn't happening, but the causes of it.  There is differences in ideas and the science behind the impact humans really have with global warming.


The earth NATURALLY cycles between warming and cooling trends.  The argument, is the speed of this and if humans are impacting the speed of these cycles.
There's a difference between conspiracy theories like the Flat Earth an actual conspiracies like 911
Global warming is a conspiracy theory
I know that each coin flip would have equal chance of being heads or tails, but is it really that counterintuitive  to expect the fourth spin to be tails ? Not because the previous flips will affect the next outcome but because ,collectively, it isnt likely? In my mind Its like getting stung by a bee today and tomorrow not worrying about getting stung again because I was stung yesterday so the odds of getting stung again today are low...  Is there a name for this kind of probability?
Not falling for the conspiracies essentially means that we have to fall for what the mainstream media is feeding is.
But calling a theory a conspiracy theory, does not make it less likely to be true. Yes some theories are pretty stupid... But some theories that has been doomed as fiction and nonsense like the UFO conspiracy theory, has showen to be not so unlikely after all.
the script was written so we like the video, at the end we’re all being controlled to like something
Well I've been hella depressed with no free dopamine and I believe some theories,
I definitely did fall for that 3 penny trend lol but honestly I think I just like conspiracies bc my ravenclaw brain just loves the process of solving mysteries
I saw shane. I clicked.
Conspiracy theorys are simply theories about a conspiracy. Not a bad thing. What you mean are crackpot conspiracy theories, which is scarily common, but thankfully enough aren't under the influence.
🤣they are watching 🤣
JK 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ok but can u explain why girls fall for it more than boys? Or why does it have a bigger affect on bi/trans ppl. Im a straight boy not trans but some of my friends are and ive noticed that they react more and kinda believe them more.
 For example a girl thats a friend believes the earth is flat.
My bi cousin thinks the moon landing was faked.
My bi cousins gf believes both
My friend thats a straight non trans boy doesnt believe in either so the same as me
Wow..beautiful
Demonitizing a video out of spite is a conspiracy.
i don't think i actually believe in any conspiracy theories but damn do i love to learn about them
WHY DOESN'T THE PIZZA MATCH UP? I want to know the real answer though.
Why do you have a map of Kolkata hanging on your wall?
3:05 😂😂😂😂😂 i am cryinnnnnnngggg
What about the Mandela effect
Idc what you say. The chuckie cheese one is real. I had a friend who used to work there and she told me to never eat there because they didn't always make fresh pizzas at her location. 

Hard pass
... Watch every conspiracy theorie is real 


BRUH
This video is a CONSPIRACY THEORY
I use to go down the rabbit hole from 9/11 to The Annunaki you name it but one day I started researching Quantum physics and things like string theory mainstream science is more crazy than any conspiracy theory in the world FACTS.... confirmation bias will wreak havoc on the ill informed
Maybe antivaxers are the way the Earth have to impulse natural selection. 
Because we are saving everyone and some people choose to go away...
The only problem is how affects other people.
‘Reality is stranger than fiction’ . Wake up people this is the matrix
We ought to encourage critical thinking, rather than trying to censor information.
Nice try illuminati I know you made this.
Ask David Wilcock about Space Nazis
How do you just discredit all conspiracy theories.
Alex Jones doesn't think the same
they’re working for the government
Howabout we talk about the real reason the government doesn’t?
lmao the comments 😂
I see what you're donig there 😆
“Literally compared to me you’re so dumb” made my day
4:57 "Falling for a conspiracy theory doesn't mean that you are stupid"

Yeah, thinking that the earth is flat and that global warming is just a hoax ain't stupid
Podcast gang we been knew 😂
what's the song for the intro?
It's simple. 
Shit happens.  
If you believe then do something. 
Other than that then go eat one. 
Their theory in it self is like most.. 
It's more towards BS
2:50  If a given coin had given several heads in a row on subsequent flips, I would suggest there might be more than 50/50 for heads the next time, as that particular coin might not be a "fair coin" - it could very well be bent or have a bulge in it somewhere.
Liking the new format!
Is the map behind you of KOLKATA INDIA?
Can you do a video on if you can actually die of heart break ? 
My great grandma past and 2 months later so did my great grandpa. We all say it’s due heartbreak
The real problem here is that today anything can be called a ''conspiracy theory'' and easily be dismissed from the public view like the whole ''pizza gate'' thing.
OMG your Right! I have 6 videos of  those videos
I see shane dawson  i click  😌
are aliens a conspiracy theory? 

is God and all religions conspiracy theories?

I'm curious what you guys think because sometimes I feel like these are exempt just because they are widely accepted
OMG 😲 JB IS A LIZARD!
Damn Greg, why are you so savage to your dog? What did it ever do to you?
Not sure if this is a conspiracy video against conspiracy videos.. but also a conspiracy video in itself...
Tea served with science! :)
Why was this so good?!
"This video was sponsored by the powers that be"
The real reason religion works
TL;DR:  "Conspiracy theories are absolutely nothing to worry about and are always based on flimsy evidence.  You should trust us because we claim to be experts in SCIENCE!"
0:29, don't u mean the queen?
Global warming is a hoax. The planet has been heating up and cooling down for millions of years and at much higher rates of change than currently seen. Now let me ask you a question? What happens if climate scientists come out and say it's not an issue. Guess what? They're out of their job and essentially sacked themselves! Why would any government fund something that's not an issue. Everyone is capable of overemphasising some things and under-emphasising other things to protect their livelihoods and jobs.
I say that global warming exists but I call bs on it being mainly from carbon dioxide. It could also be from increased solar activity, but carbon dioxide isn't the main issue
This video reminds me of 2012 for some reason
Climate change is more of a threat than there not being climate change. Even if vaccines did cause autism, viruses like polio are more threatening. If someone was afraid of threats, I would think they would believe what's worse whether it was a conspiracy or not. But maybe has something to do with personal judgement about what's better or worse.
The first video I thought of was the conspiracy video about how the victims of school shootings in florida were “crisis actors”

This world can be so sick and vile
I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but it's interesting to hear about them
Video would be better if you guys stop switching from talking
So basically with the right words, and Techne you can convince anybody to believe it.
I'm early , I'm shook , I'm happy I came early for asap science aka my love
Belief and knowledge are partners not rivals.
I agree with most of it but some conspiracy theories are true

Like the banking elite control of the money. Look at the gold and dollar relationship
If a coin comes up heads 3 times in a row... I'm going to assume that the next one is heads, because it's increasingly likely it's a 2-headed coin... ;)
This is gobbledygook
Conspiracy theories are due to the fact that we the people don’t trust our own government. It’s a way of not trusting authority. When people don’t trust something, they think of alternatives to situations and events that could
Possibly occur.
All conspiracy have a core of truth. it gets crazy once your imagination fills the lack of evidence with more insane claims. If you think there's a conspiracy, stick to the visible evidence, don't make it up, it will make you crazy lol. There' are not coincidences, unless you are a nobody, with not connections to do a red flag event, and then it happens, that s unexplained.....no resource to be a future producer from your bedroom.
Aluminati confirm...
I'm doing my research paper on conspiracy theories and their effectiveness - this couldn't have come in better time. Thanks!
Putin Putin Putin 

I see Russians everywhere

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
grab your tinfoil hats everyone!
When you see something enough times if you have questions do research don't assume just read and read and read all in the attempt to gain understanding
Watching this to improve my theories
It's weird that y'all say that because I listen to Twenty One Pilots on YouTube and the algorithm recommended those exact videos to me. However, I did not watch them as I am a person of curiosity, but I can tell pretty well if something is made up or false
Doritos is shaped like the pyramid .
I love the tone of this one xD
Why not create conspiracy theories based on the truth?
I love this new video style please do more!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!11
How do they define a conspiracy theory ?
Casually planting that climate stuff in there and fully condemning one side of the debate...
I mean yeah your right about how misinformation is a problem but I want YouTube to recommend me videos I think are entertaining even if they are conspiracy theories
Guys, I'm not supposed to say my opinion but I think they've been cloned. Better call shane. (Jk haha... or am I?)
Alright, who ever wrote that intro music at 1:00 has been listening to a lot of Einstein on the Beach or just Philip Glass in general, because I have been listening to a lot of Glass recently for my music history final that I had this morning lol.
They just busted a conspiracy on us.
I disagree.  Intelligent people who constantly question the world around them and consistently apply the scientific method, rarely fall victim to conspiracy theories.  On the other hand, people who are unable to accept logical conclusions or are unwilling to debate, tend to fall to conclusions of the conspiratorial nature.

TL;DR
Dumb people believe in conspiracies, smart people make their own decisions based on facts.
I'd really like to know logic behind "falling for conspiracy theories does not mean you're stupid"!
You didn't bring any possible mechanism up for that you just declared.
The lizard one 







lOLOLOlOLolOloL
The government paid asapscience to make this cover up video
They’re only conspiracy theories until they’re not
Those painting are done by individuals... just saying.
I’m sorry but I love Greg’s glasses 😂 and the video ❤️
I love this. Very well put. Thank you for this. Watching at 12:30 AM. Philippines.
Let's talk about the pizza recycling.
I work at a restaurant, I wash dishes, I'm 15 years old get €2,95 an hour really sad.
Now regularly the chef's come to me and say can you put the cold sauce from the plates and bowls back into the pan so we can serve it again, I was really disgusted about it so I didn't do it (they didn't notice) and then at the end of the evening they just put the sauces in the pans back into the freezer with alot of other things. They just re-use everything that's still good. Not surprised if it happens at more restaurants, and be aware it might be recycled food!!
YouTube algorithms is the new conspiracy theory
Yall teach me more than school
Scientific consensus proves global warming sense when does consensus determine science! Global Warming is a Conspiracy Theory.
Your usual video style is much, MUCH better
Im glad you made this video
WHY WAS THE CONDUCTOR EDIT SO GOOD
i guess you're right , everything in the world is exactly the way it seems and no one would ever lie to you ..
İts 1:50am why am i watching this
Admit it! Conspiracy theories are cool af!!
This conspiracy theory is lacking in creativity. Is that your best?
Shane Dawson wants to know your location
Conspiracy Facts are supported by evidence. Ever heard of the word?
The biggest conspiracy is that life is a simulation. Wake up John! Don't let them fool you any longer!
they are working with the government for sure
They have NASA mug on the background they must be part of the ILLUMINOYTY!oneone11
Eddie Bravo has joined the chat
ASAP HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE GOVERNMENT, DONT BELIEVE A WORD THEY SAY
Melted beams don't fuel airplane steel.
WTC7 is a conspiracy theory.  The “we decided to pull it” theory.  Do you want to talk about that?
I think the content of this video is totally valid, however remember this: The existence of the NSA (No Such Agency lol) was a 'conspiracy theory' for a looong time. The idea that some powerful people might get together and plan something in secret is not ridiculous. It happens all the time.
For some reason, Asapscience videos have the best comment sections
Do a video that explains why the pizza doesnt line up
Really?  What kind of knucklehead gets an ego boost thinking about how dumb the dog is?
Science! **mic drop**
why, you ask?
#IgnoranceEmpowerment
2:12 Also known as a form of confirmation bias.
Would OCD Increase belief in conspiracy theories?
Climate change isn’t global warming
Keep on question society, totally fine
Conspiracy theory is an idiots phrase used to excuse their inability to question anything out of fear of being wrong or sticking out. If you research its conception you would figure it out. Or just think about what it is. Which is just another way of saying figuring out or researching other people's figuring out what groups of other people are doing amd why regardless of what they themselves claim. As if groups of people never lied before right?????

If it was the same thing about individuals it would be called a theory. The difference between a conspiracy theory and a theory is nothing at all. Seriously this channel is for boot licking tools made by one. Ofcoase many theories are wrong. No fkn shit sherlock!!!!! Seriously youre a moron.
As im watching this im naked and im sitting and im clenching my cheeks
So um, probability is a conspiracy theory...cool. I mean what are the odds you will flip 4 heads in a row...or 5, or 6...
Woah I'm early
Do one on Mendela effect pls🙏🙏
how to make conspiracy theories:
step 1:put circles at videos and/or photos
step 2:say"this is not normal"
Very interesting but still the problem remains. Conspiracy theories are causing a lot of trouble in the world
Be careful when you try to discredit a celebrity by making her or him foolish. Using an ad hominem charge is not a valid argument. You could have said that they don't have any expertise in that field ( knowledge, degrees etc). Would you have tell Tesla his work on electricity was non sens because he was a weirdo with his bird.... Otherwise good video.
Did you believe the Trump/Russia hoax?
I was at my local Hospital a few weeks ago and I'm telling you there is something fishy going on with the nursing department. I think they purposely try to keep patients they like longer. I'm telling you they slipped me extra medication. IM NOT CRAZY. Also I think one of the nurses was on to me so from that point forward all the other nurses would turn on the alarm on my bed.
the 'erath' is flat.
Thank you! I literally was just saying today that I find conspiracy theories interesting because I am curious why people believe them and like to keep an open mind to why people think the way they do
Most of thoses conspiracies been still proven years later ...
Kolkata 🙌🙌
The only conspiracy theory I believe in is JFK's assassination and even then I believe it was Oswald that fired the shots.
I think this video is a conspiracy..lol
Please make a video on "what happens when a bone breaks...and heals?"
Secure team
Ooo someone in the comments recommended something nice! Explore some explanations to Deja Vu 😁
Some conspiracy theories are fine to believe, still false, but not harmful. Some are harmful and need changing.
I'm curious to know the YouTube's definition of "borderline content" ...
YouTube literally had a conspiracy theory video suggested right next to this video
Here's a conspiracy theory North is South and South is North
Magnetic fields work out North in South but the earth's magnetic field works out South in North
Heeeey leave dogs alone!! >:(
"
falling for conspiracy theories does not mean that you are stupid"


Yes it does.
Can you do the science of food?
Can the next video be on sleep paralysis
They work because they’re true
The real reason conspiracy theories work: because some of them have been/are true.
This episode is sponsored by: REDACTED
I love this kind of video format
Shane wins a Streamy and gets a video all about his video in one week lol
You have no real facts backing up your opinion.
My conspiracy theory is that unintentional or not in any bipartisan system both sides will work together to make their sepperation irrational and ultimately. impossible to breach for mutual goals.
But mark zuckerberg is an alien for sure
Here a good one : America had a Coup at the beginning of this century. 💃
No wonder y I believe in conspiracy theories cuz im nervous all time and have load of dopamine in my brain
Just like the "conspiracy" that the government is collecting data on you. Hummmm talk to Snowden about that. Just like building number 7 free fall is normal and no need to investigate. Just like no news about Fukushima. No worries, keep shopping
Funny because it is provable that bankers control the world.
We are a very smart animal. Some smarter than others.
Why tf would I not constantly question my government? They have power over me and my life and the money to keep that power. Think about all the other things people wrote off as crazy conspiracy theories, that actually ended up being true;
Project Paper Clip
The Gov poisoning alcohol during prohibition
MK Ultra
GayBomb Experiments 
The Nayirah’s Testimony Hoax
And the list goes on, and on, and on. Why trust a group that manipulates you so much? Why not look for patterns and hidden meanings? Why not question everything? If theres even a little bit of a chance your life is a government made lie why not put in the research and time to figure it out?
Idk maybe it can be harmful but sometimes the good outweighs the bad.
But why do you have to make it creepy?! I want to watch but its 1am here and I'm alone in the dark 😕
The real title of this videos should be "Why religion and other forms of non-secular worship work"
The Bible is the most believed conspiracy of all human existence
Ignorance but mostly fear. No wonder how some conspiracy theories believers are more susceptible to feelings rather than facts (i.e. Anti-Vax moms).
Greg only got a dog to make fun of it
Umm I would say it would be heads. Anyone else? 2:50
I don’t care what anybody says. That Chuck E Cheese reused pizza theory must be true!
Lots of conspiracies turned out to be true, so don't stop questioning and don't just believe everything you're told.
Wouldn't global warming deniers and anti vax be doing the opposite of safe than sorry and against evolution?
Soooo Anxiety??......
Loved the intro!
Ok vax dont cause autism, sure but why do they have mercury in them...like everything that doesn't agree w/ the official narrative is a conspiracy theorist. If a person says "you don't know they're doing..." But if you follow patterns to see that you're right then they say it doesn't apply to everything...smh
bo idea what the heck you are talking about
Skepticism is a fine line between believing and denial 🤔
they didn’t mention the ramsey theory or pareidolia
Everything is related ti dopamine these days. - this was conspiracy theory, or was it? Bum bum buuum
Vaccines cause global warming
I hope social media companies and youtube find a solution to handle these things in countries like India too.
In India most of the conspiracy theories, pseudoscience stuff and misinformation is spread in local languages. And we have a huge problem here. Social media and YouTube is aggravating this in a very big way.
WHo is here after the story😂
2:50 jojo siwa in the right corner
First
They are saying that conspiracy theories are fake and we should not believe them but what if they know they are true and want to hide the truth 🤔😮
I'm doing a project on conspiracy theories I school right now.
You know what, the fact that YouTube is putting those Wikipedia pages under conspiracy theories would probably just make those people believe the theory even more because "ohhhoho they're trying to change my mind this theory MUST be true"
In my opinion the problem is that even scientific papers are research where always influenced by the sponsor or funding party. This was done with oil, sugar and other research. This is what hurts the belief in science.
No mention of the Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory, I see.
Conspiracies occur all the time. Every surprise birthday party is a conspiracy. Go look up the definition of "conspiracy". It is normal and expected within the stock market. The term "conspiracy theory" was coined and created by the CIA, and that in itself is another one of those true conspiracies. This term "conspiracy theory" is used to discredit people who expose conspiracies by the ruling class. I will remind you, that conspiracies are normal and you have probably been involved in several conspiracies in your life. Like I said, every surprise birthday party is a conspiracy. Trying to keep the presents you bought for your kids for Christmas a secret while working with your husband/wife who is working with you to keep the secret from the kids, is a conspiracy. Everything that is classified information, is a conspiracy. When that classified information gets released by whistle blowers, the government often labels those whistle blowers as "conspiracy theorists". 

Don't buy the hype.
2:31 That s the sound you hear when you get a question correct on mathswatch
I believe in science so i dont believe in conspiracies im a smart boii
Most Conspiracy theories are made just for fun but mostly for misinformation. There is truth but it has to be found beneath the veil of Isis and this is not a conspiracy.
I just gained all my brain cells back
It’s great that I have ADHD so my dopamine doesn’t work good.
Wow early.
Can you guys make a video of scientific way to make true friends? I need it please :(
watching this with tinfoil on my head
This video was sponsored by the CIA.
DISAPIONTING VIDEO HERE! :  (
   Your now the oposite of Robin Hood.. Helping out the rich and hurting the poor.
     SHAME
DOn't forget that they use the worst bias ever: ANY evidence against the theory is plated evidence. EVERY SINGLE ONE.
The editing looks like Shane's videos😂
That's no conspiracy, justin is a lizard.
3:11 why does that photoshop lol so real I’m dead
Jet fuel melting steal beams isnt conspiracy its science
I hate conspiracy theory. Sometimes it is really nonsense, like flat earth or fake moon. Oooh. I think it is fooling us. 💫🤯😵🤮
This viedeo is designed to make you think  it's unnecessary and ridiculous to look at topics from different angles  and to stop you from examine someone's statement and building your own opinion and think critically about the "main stream media assumptions". Not every "non mainstream" or rare assumption is ridiculous and wrong  because there is no known "proof" for the big masses, think about it 💭
This was recommended to me 😂
It’s not misinformation. Its that we’re not getting enough information and things don’t add up. Many conspiracies I believe are true. Some are a bit of a stretch but all have some truth to it. The world revolves around an illusion itself, money. Thats all people want. Conspiracies don’t seem irrational. They make you smart if anything imo.
Is anyone going to bring up the statistics of the quarters?

they work because they are real sometimes, while everyone says you are coocoo, ones the information is out, they just shut theyre mouth
Conspiracy theories are like a new kind of virus. a very dangerous one
I spent a solid few weeks binge watching conspiracy theories by bright insight I'd tell myself that it was for fun, no way would I believe in advanced ancient civilizations and if I did it was harmless but sure enough I started to feel paranoid that I was being lied to which then made the antivax stuff I'm plauged with in my parenting groups seem more likely, I started to second guess getting my son his upcoming vacations
So I went on a YouTube detox only watching actual educational videos and wiggles with my son now only a small part of me belives  in atlantis and we have kept to his vaccination schedule
This seems like a theory that you guys have conspired together on...
Its not just crazy conspiracy's anymore... shit's getting real.
So you mention the 50/50 chance with the coin flip being heads or tails, and correlate that with illusory pattern perception? So you completely disregard the law of large numbers?...either your coin is heads on both sides, or a logical assessment would be to expect tails. You flip a coin 100 times and probability says that you'll get heads 50 times and tails 50 times. Again no disagreement that each individual flip is a 50/50 chance (technically 51/49 but we won't get that deep) on heads/tails, but 3 heads in a row absolutely increases the statistical probability of tails on the subsequent flip. Because now we aren't looking at it as ONE flip, we are looking at 4 flips and we can plug in the answers for 1, 2, and 3; we have more information with which to build a hypothesis. I'll go with the 62% chance of the 4th flip being tails, because math is on my side. Come on guys...its called science and you failed in this description. You have to be able to take things to extremes and for them to be true. Say you flip a real coin 99 times and it lands heads every time, should I expect heads again because that specific individual flip has a 50/50 chance or go with the 150,000,000,000^17 likelihood that it'll be tails because I have previous information I can build a logical conclusion from?
Damn. Cloud people are the worst.
i love when science shuts up all of "them"
Nice try! But you’re not going to convince me that global warming is real or that vaccines aren’t evil! It’s all just to brainwash us! 








If you didn’t notice, this isn’t a serious comment.
Background music plays a key role in these conspiracy theory videos...it hve to be creepy
What if this video is a conspiracy theory?
Or maybe it has to do with all the conspiracies that were proven to be true... bohemian grove ,  operation mockingbird, the prohibition,  SV40, the fruit machine, project sunshine, mkultra, tonkin,  Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ,  operation paperclip, operation popeye, and OPERATION NORTHWOODS.

If you trust yourgovernment, you're not paying attention. Conspiracies are healthy
I also think there's a difference between dangerous conspiracy theories like the anti vaxxer theories and Flat Earth one is pretty safe it's not going to hurt anyone the other can cause a pandemic
i mean isn't everything a conspiracy theory?
So global warming is just a conspiracy therorie?
I said tales. 😭😭😭
The illusionary pattern perception seems a lot like confirmation bias. I’m just a first year psychology major, but is it so?
Shane is pretty open about it being conspiracy fun, lol.
Even if conspiracy theories have low probability, given enough of them, the chance of one of them being true becomes greater and greater.
Because half the time they are real
Not to sound rude but if you were able to do a collab with Shane that'd be cool hint hint
This video was disappointing - the examples about global warming, vaccines or lizard people are clearly able to be proven wrong and can even be damaging when this misinformation is spread. However, other conspiracy theories about government cover-ups or unexplained phenomena are different in that we have seen evidence or even proof that experts and scientists can’t explain. The whole premise of this video that conspiracy theories are just things that our minds are “tricked” into believing is just adding to the trope that all conspiracy theories are crazy and could never be possible 😕
PROVEN FACTS:
1 - Vaccines💉 are safe and refusing to take them is leading to worldwide eoidemics
2 - Climate Change🌍🌡 is real and we have roughly 12 years to solve it
3 - Shakespeare🎭 wrote his own plays
4 - No mass shooting🔫 is a "false flag" operation
5 - There are no such things as "Chem Trails"🛩
6 - The Moon Landing🌒🚀 was NOT faked
7 - 9/11 was NOT "an inside job"
8 - The Holocaust✡ DID occur
9 - The Earth🌍 is NOT hollow or flat
10 - Racism, misogyny, homophobia, and socio-economic inequality are not only all real, but their continued proliferation hurts EVERYONE.✊🏿

...to name but a few crackpot theories.
Tell me comment section: is it a conspiracy theory about conspiracy theories?
Omg like if you’re early
Maby this is a conspiracy
The comments now is 669.
So close.
I think Shane needs to debunk his theories. That will make his work seem more objective about these stuff. And plus there are people actually who believe in these stuffs, especially if the person they look up to says it. I mean , we hate beauty gurus based on who drama channels tell us to hate so...😐
So if we all have those same cognitive biases that can lead us to believe conspiracy theories, then what does it take to reduce or even eliminate, the likelihood of believing any conspiracy theories. Because I for one, don't believe a single conspiracy theory.

So that coin-flip thing? Setting aside the fact that, yes, it's a 50% chance any given time (and in fact any combination and order is going to ultimately be as unlikely as any other), the "pattern" my mind jumped to was that it'd be heads. Just as an initial, of course, but it seems interesting to me that my brain went dead opposite of where the video was going, while still managing to be initially wrong.
We need to stop immediately believing that something is a conspiracy just because it sounds fishy. If you really want to know if the world is round or flat or other theories go look your self.
Make a video about deja Vu please
Okay I have one for you building 7.
How can anybody say global warming isn't real? Smh
2:38 did anyone else get an error message saying it’s 50/50. I got one.
Because u know youre not gonna get a solid answer
Since a likelihood to believe conspiracy theories increases with dopamine, would that mean depressed people are less likely to believe them?
This is actually really sad, ya'll gunna pass off an entire group of people based on the word "Conspiracy"
I don't think its ok to label an entire group of people or an entire idea without looking at all possible sides first.
2:50 is that jojo siwa???
I dont like the stop motion part. I feel like it's not "comfortable" watching ( I don't know how to describe it very well). I do like the mix of both drawing and camera
Is Illusory Pattern Perception why psychedelics cause visuals? The more bizarre and confusing our thoughts gst about the world, the more patterns our minds make up to try to stay sane and connected with reality?
Most conspiracy theriors arent "conspiracy theriors" most of the govorment related ones during war times and none war including jfk finding the shooter and the moon landin being fake, them only going to the moon in 1876 and it being 2019 with cyborgs ans going to mars but not to the moon?

Children who have been vaccinated are more likely to get autism!





Because the kids who don’t get vaccinated are dead 😂
Hell, better be ready then not
LOL - references including New York Times and the Guardian... Need I say more. See CDCs own data on the lower autism rate if vaccines given at age 3 or later. This is not antivax; It's trying to make them safer
When the conspiracy theories are true tho
please put a caption in your videos, it will be more easy to other nationality people to understand them and even to legend it on his language
Why believing in a conspiracy is wrong?
It helps us think and understand the working and then question what is possible or not ?
I don't believe in any though, unless Pokemon and game theories count but if someone were to interview the director of Pokemon and they denied it then I would believe the director lo

Idc, even if it’s false that you get autism from vaccines I can still say whatever I want by we live in democracy.
funny, I just watched the episode of adam ruins everything on conspiracy theories last night
I sense a left-wing bias here. Not saying you're wrong, but...
SHANE IS SHOOK
I suspect there is a global Jewish conspiracy. That was formed in response to proven global animosity against Jews. They decided to form it because of the labelling problem. Because since they were persistently labelled as manipulative, with or without basis in fact.
I hope to see more videos on here and vlogs! We miss you!
3:09 actually looks so real!
Literally so many people I know still say global warming is a hoax when it is going to be 90 degrees in Washington in MAY and it reached 110 degrees last summer. I’ve witnessed the change and I’m only 19.
9/11 was an inside job 👍
Is that Bill Cipher in the thumbnail?
Ok but consistently reproducible evidence of misplaced slices of pizza? And no evidence of one that looks normally sliced? That's a good argument if Chuck-E-Cheese can't prove they don't recycle pizzas.

Great, informative video, Thanks ! ! !
From science to conspiracy
Interesting video but I believe that it's dangerous to completely dismiss conspiracy theories, I know some are absurd such as flat Earth, climate-change deniers etc but  to assume everything the government tells is the absolute truth is also dangerous, people should be able to think for themselves and be conscientious objectors.
The problem is that under all theories lies the truth. And usually it is worse than theory.
Mitch’s hair is on point
I feel a huge (maybe primary) contributor to our vulnerability to Conspiracy Theories is the human bias toward Tribalism. If you notice, Conspiracies need a lot of support to survive.  They only survive  if there is a group to feed them.  A recent Scientific American article pointed out that early humans was so vulnerable that Tribalism was the only way we survived.  Now that tribalism is baked into who we are.  A recent study of vaccination rates in Oregon show that rates are clustered.  The people that are against vaccination are always found in groups (tribes).  Wrong or right, it doesn't matter, as long as our ideas are shared.

In all honesty, the only conspiracy I would be open to is the CIA having a hand in the JFK assassination.  I wouldn't say I believe it, but I would also say the moral standards of the CIA in that time period would not be above ot

You have advertisements during your conspiracy video why? Conspiracy videos have been deemed non advertiser friendly.

5:09 UMM RUDE!
A common trait in intelligent people is the ability to not shut a differing idea off from the list of total possibilities. So automatically not believing something purely because it’s labeled as a conspiracy theory is just as bad as blindly following conspiracy theories. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions.
Because dumb people do exist, and it's entertaining.
FIRST OF ALL giving as an example A CONSPIRACY ABOUT PIZZA, really about PIZZA it's just ridiculous. Second most of Shane's videos are for entertaining purpose only, not to be confused i have full respect for him as a youtuber. More than a 100 kids every year are confused about THEIR GENDER because media and movies is brainwashing them pushing gender neutral and transgender agenda. Celebrities are encouraging gender surgery on a 3 year old kids, because kid knows the best. A 3 year old kid should be worrying about potty training not its gender. And you are telling us that DEPOPULATION AGENDA is just a conspiracy, just a fairytale, a myth. ANSWER ME THIS WOULD YOU EXIST TODAY IF YOUR GRANDPARENTS DECIDED TO CHANGE THEIR GENDER??? WOULD YOU??!! 
Its just ridiculous. 
WAKE UP PEOPLE, LION SLEEPS NO MORE!!!!!!

But if the main difference between a conspiracy and a legit theory is that a legit theory can be tested and validated and repeated and yada yada, what do we do when society won’t allow us to test the theory? I guess you could say it’s “unfalsifiable” and just believe with caution. I think the main problem is believing in a conspiracy but also having strong belief perseverance. You have to be able to be accepting of new evidence that goes against what you believe, but I think it’s also important to stay questioning
I am a man of science and try to stray away from conspiracy theories as much as I can. But the bush did 9/11 theory is one I can't fault.
and this is why I dont look at trending pages on youtube... I will pick my own videos thank you very much.
Paid for by the US Government
Love asap science
Shoot Leftists
I don't know for US YouTube but french YouTube have a huge trend of debinking
We all know that we don't know what conspiracy means
Except for the fact that vaccines are actually dangerous and the coverup is absolutely a conspiracy. 🐑
Conspiracy theory=The narrative news channels don’t show us. It’s that simple. Is the news trustworthy?
Conspiracy theories were made to fool the audience. So it will be hard to tell if it is true or nots
New conspericy therory my armpit smells bad
Has anybody else noticed that Shane deleted many of his conspiracy videos?
C'mon man...use ur regular start method... Music visual etx..
every time you're faced with a conspiracy theory, ask yourself: if it were true, would it benefit mainly very large multinational to make more money and very rich people get richer? if yes, there is a likelyhood that it is true. if no, it's probably not
Pollocks paintings do have corelating patterns but thats unintentional, the patterns comes from how he used to chuck an throw paint on the canvas, one's flexibility limits one's stroke's when painting like this, in doing so leaving an unintentional pattern and with enough paintings, you can detect the pattern of motion left by the artists body.
Conspiracy in a conspiracy theory
Illuminati Confirmed.
I thought it was a Shane Dawson vid then I saw it was 8 minutes long 😖😖
Nope. I gave the video a chance, I gave you a chance, and you blew it. 


Naivety and idiocy abound. There are truths you don't want to accept... and no, I don't think it's ok that you chose to preach this message of 'ignorance is bliss - when it comes to important issues/ topics'. 


You do reasonable work science wise. OK. Fine. So do you want to discuss ancient history with your audience in an objective way? Do you want to discuss what evidence draws people to particular conclusions? No? Why? 


Why do increasing numbers of people feel like we live in '1984' or 'Brave New World' style of societies at this point? 



If there are anomalies to a given body of evidence... like out of place physical artefacts much older than we like to say our civilisation is - what is the scientifically objective and socially conscious response to that information?  


(so now my text i'm typing is showing as red on my screen, while the word 'artefacts' in the above sentence is still written in white, and sentences/ paragraphs above are also written in white, still... that's pretty weird. Not happened before. Not saying it's a conspiracy - just reflecting how strange it is that this particular circumstance of me writing this, comes with a weird coincidental oddity that's new. I'm sure youtube/ windows has a good reason, lol. I'm sure if I looked this up, there'd be an explanation...)


To my mind. People who are open to conspiracy theories - which 'anything' can be a 'conspiracy'... right? Government, is a conspiratorial construct. A good, needed and valid construct to my eyes, but nonetheless a product of conspiracy, no? 


- Don't be idiots and advise yourselves or others, against asking questions and enquiring as to the hows and why's of things. 


I am vaccinated, but the evidence and arguments for those who do not wish to accept all and every vaccination on faith... those seem reasonable, asking questions - and wanting information which they intentionally do not provide, is reasonable. 


We can not, and should not, live under the expectation that a pharmaceutical company has our best interests at heart. It doesn't. Profit, is their core desire. 


OoooooOOOOhhhh... back to white!


9/11.... You're a fool if you believe the face value government position on 9/11. No way around it. That day's events did absolutely not transpire in line with the stated narrative. You can call people who consider the options whatever you want... that doesn't change the reality. 


The government has carried out 'false flags'. Yes. 100% proven. Obviously not everything is that. But... c'mon you clowns, look into the data pertaining to that day, and you will find what you would be looking for.... unless what you are looking for is a scientifically sound adherence to the given narrative, in which case you would be sorely disappointed. 


... I don't want to overcook it. Those are fine areas to begin with. Perhaps looking into corruption and the prison system... and financial systems, banking industries etc... I think you should be able to look at the structure and literal reality of those institutions/ constructs, and understand that those industries, exist in a conspiratorial framework. They are products of conspiracy. Not subject to pure 'theory'. But more so 'understanding'. 


You follow? 


What if... everything you ever knew was a lie? 


History? 


Society? 


Rule? 


Opportunity? 


.... As an aside. I haven't heard any arguments that climate change isn't occurring. At least not from anyone I would consider 'conspiratorially minded' - just from your standard idiots.


Ok. It's done it again... seems to be related to words I mis-typed. ... anyway... The arguments I hear, coming from 'my people' - are more along the lines of the notion of the cycle of cataclysm that our planet goes through... y'know... the one that sees civilisations wiped away periodically every odd thousands of years... for me, folks that take issue with how climate change is presented, do so from the perspective that essentially... we are all doomed anyway. Humans may be having an impact, but is that impact more than the cosmos/ planet would be foisting on us without our influence? 


- And i'm not smart enough to answer that from my own mind!


I have to rely on other folks data, and I have to err on the side that we could be doing society in a far less destructive way. And that would likely give us an extra decade or two at least, lol.

(But that it is 'too late' no? We're already in the '6th mass extinction' no? Ocean life has dropped 60% in some areas, mammal life 70-80% - since the 70's? incect life has declined as well... Nevermind sperm counts and our human... 'State of body' - with pollutants really harming us beyond what we acknowledge. We're pretty stuffed is how it seems to many. For the vast majority of the species)

Good luck though!
And yet you didn't bother to mention the part where history has proven that certain conspiracy have happened throughout human history.
You want me to believe that people believing in conspiracy theories are not stupid!? -sorry I am not falling for that one.
I dont think wikipedia Links below videos would help, in the minds of those who believe in conspiracy theories wikipedia is just an other website trying to hide the truth.

They’re illuminate members to convince us that nothing suspicious is going on so they can perform their illuminate plans. This is pure evidence.

I was former conspiracy believer. I believed in many conspiracy theories. But I decided to over analyze the conspiracies and found so many flaws in them. I decided to quit believing in any conspiracies and unsubscribed all conspiracies channels around 2 years ago. Suddenly, you are here to talk about the conspiracy manipulate people to believe this video to against different side of conspiracies. (It sounds like this video has its own conspiracy). I had to unsubscribe this channel. Farewell.

Haha...conspiracy theories.
Stupid people want to bring measles back
Arabic please 🙄
But there are other causes for making ppl susceptible.  I find that Americans are more prone to this behaviour than where I am from and it stems from a large distrust of government which has extended to authority in general.  If NASA says it landed on the moon or that the earth is round, there are some who distrust this because of the source.  And it's not hard to see why.  There is a president who clearly is acting against the best interests of an entire segment of US population and heritage or other authorities who will not take poisonous lead out of drinking water or allows for low health food supply which is killing Americans across the board in the name of capitalism. With conditions like these, its more than psychological.
Americans must be much dumber than I thought, if a 50% of them believe in at least one conspiracy theory.
We need to report this video
I just figured most people in the US are idiots.
flat earthers are enraged
People conspire daily.
I went to algotansparency and apparently one of the top recommended videos is one I've watched recently. But I found that video manually on the channel's most viewed page because I liked one of their other videos (which is currently not recommended) and decided to check out more from that channel. Probably just coincidence.
I think that the way consperacy theories are written also plays a role in it. They are often times very scientific and well written and that can fool more people than you think. Just look at how easily people accept the information given in their echo chambers as truth.
Wait..... Wait.... I have the same exact glasses......
Most of the People I know also think evolution is fake and a conspiracy plot by Satan soooo idk if they will listen to the video
Is this a conspiracy of a conspiracy theroys?

Or people just look at stuff in different ways because looking at everything the same way is brainwashing
Alright then
The only way you prove anything these days is to go outside. We can't do that because we are secretly vampires.
this reminds me of Pascals wager and religion
“If I ever need an ego boost I go up to my dog and I’m like literally compared to me you are so dumb.” 😂
We would all be better off if we just got measles like the old days and got a natural immunity, instead on relying every single person to get vaccinated. Prolly save lots of money to. Measles doesn’t kill unless you ancient or newborn so we fine.
Lol never had a vaccine, never been sick
Letting misinformation get out there won't lead to more people buying it, it puts it up for correction. This is why freedom of press and expression are important, to figure out what's true and what isn't. This is how we decide what's factual truth in the first place.
We should just have random doctors stealth injecting people.
this is so scary
Hmm reminds me of your Sidenote episode
EARLY
Earlyy
I was waiting for the part where you guys talked about the actual conspiracy theories that were true.  Like Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments , Army Homophobia, the Movie Vice that explains 50% of what everybody thought was true. GMOs, monsantos, nazi's in S. America, reagan pusing crack in to black neighborhoods... i could keep going. This could add to hysteria because in all honesty we dont know what to trust. Then conspiracy is if you tell 1 lie youve probably told more. Are we going crazy believing everything thats on youtube ... definitely. At the same time Bill Clinton apologized for taking part in the over-policing and disproportionate incarceration of blacks and latinos. ...add that in the part 2
Actually, if a coin lands on head many times in a row, I'm more likely to believe the next flip will be heads as well, because it increases the probability that the coin was weighted in the first place.
Wait if they were given a dopamine drug then wouldn’t that be like addiction level 9000? Please reply if you know
Wogooooo
This is.... the r word I cant say in order to be politically correct. Just because you dub something a "conspiracy theory" 1) doesn't make it automatically false 2) does not invalidate the person or his beliefs/evidence connected or not to the idea. How could you possibly cite studies stating that over 50% of americans believe in a conspiracy theory? Which theories were polled?  Was it the same 5 normie brain dead lizard people illumnaugty bush did 911 nasa never landed on the moon flat earth bull shit? 



Spoiler alert for the brain dead (which may or may not include the participants of this video)... There were (and still are) conspiracy theories that turned out to be true... therefore they are no longer called conspiracy theories because they are now facts. Open your brains everybody. Now when whatever alphabet media outlets use the words conspiracy and theory in tandem this video is the blame for some idiots automatically fearing the idea and not using their own critical faculties to figure out fact from fiction.
Trust no one
You may even believe one yourself right now.  Yeah, like Russian collusion conspiracy lol

Your theory are crap
8:25
It’s not a conspiracy theory it’s a fact. This channel is so stupid.
MK Ultra is hiding the truth! Michele Obama is a reptilian overlord! Pineapples are an artificial vegetable!
This is why religion and god works too. What a deep revealing insight into our human nature this is
Why does it always boil down to antivax and global warming? Long ago vaccines were great then all of a sudden pharmacies can't be sued when people are injured by vaccines, why? The companies need to come clean about what is in the vaccines, stop over dosing children, and seriously the patents on the virus strain should not exist. Climate change is real. What is being ignored is our impact on the speed of natural affects. Deniers don't accept it is only man made or only natural. Antivaxer are not against the science of vaccine good but against the lack of proper testing die to company self regulation and motivation for profit Alone. No money in healthy people. Fear monger get them in the door overwhelm the doctor give a pill or shot to shut them up. If global warming is so severe why are we not making more effort to go to renewable energy? The things above are why they are not theriories but fact riddled with misinformation.  Everyone is confused and people in charge are lying by omission
Also goggles has a superiority complex. Seriously Bro pull yourself down off that pedastal, fun video thou can't wait for more.
The coin flip analogy is misused in this case because even tho each time you flip a coin it’s 50/50 probability, the probability of getting a certain side in a row decreases each time you flip
I believe that the richest people in the world control the society. And the media help push the propaganda that they want us to believe

Cos they're true
That's what they want you to think
Its so lovely
Something like 40% of americans believe in a young earth so your statistic is probably wrong
Leave shane alone
YAY
Love youuuuu
Wake up people...
Chucky cheese!!!!
religion is a conspiracy theory
There are definitely a lot of fake conspiracy theories out there. They probably make up the majority. But when you do your own research and see indisputable evidence from multiple sources, certain “conspiracy theories” become very hard to deny. Even if you don’t want to believe them
Play it safe, to the point where you'll be good in each scenario. People believe in religion some believe it's man made couple 100 years ago. Even if it was fake doing what's right and believing in God would keep you on the safe side either way. @moedntworry on Instagram =D
Fury was robbed
I think this can go hand-in-hand with religion.
The one thing that drew me to this is Shane Dawson
So... religion is just a conspiracy theory!  Now religion makes sense!
Translate to arabic please
If you think about it... religions are conspiracy theories...
Who here believes in aliens? I remember when it used to be a conspiracy to believe in them. Now it seems most people do...
There are patterns in every random set of things
Wow... very......🙏💟💟💕💕💕
9/11 did bush
Love it!
When I heard The boom, I thought I was watching CrazyRussianHacker

3:08 WHY DOES IT LOOK SO REAL
Have you guys read "The Idiot Brain" by Dean Burrett? that book explains this and more of the brain's phenomena! Its a great book
So conspiracy theorist are a burden to society.....
Who tf is Shane Dawson?
Lol i wached this and now all snakes look like stiks pls help got bitten 3 times
YouTube can literally recommend videos that fit their agenda and warp the minds of the viewers, it’s definitely scary
i found a easy way to kill all the idiots! make sure to ask thoroughly if they want to be vaccinated
I don't think humans are as smart as we egotistically believe. I don't think we are capable of a lot of things we claim we are capable of but haven't come close to achieving. Take artificial intelligence as an example. We have only created complicated programs that are able to follow extremely basic rules in one small environment. Namely Go and Chess. It is a folly to believe that any program could cause intelligence to form simply because programs do specific things and never actually stray from the pattern except in cases of a mistake by a programmer or an electron getting knocked out of position by a cosmic ray or fast moving particle.
Liked these guys till they mentioned the whole vaccine thing 🙄 tbh you’re stupid if you think injecting yourself with chemicals doesn’t pose a threat to your health
I remember back in 2013 and 2014 I would try to search up conspiracy theories videos and there was hardly any and people would think your crazy but now there's a lot of people that believe in it now..
So uh i don't believe you!
Unsubscribed !!! 😂 - Goodbye -
We’ve been lied to our whole lives (by politicians, news, religious leaders, even teachers and parents). This is just what happens when people search for truth in a very complicated world.
I have never fallen for a single ridiculous, waste-of-life, misleading, rubbish idea!
Hello everyone😊
democracy = cancer
How much is youtube paying you to make this video? The truth is what really scares people. That's why we have media platforms to lie to our face.  Wake up sheep!
Damn
I’m always disappointed when I watch the videos that contain “secrets”
Shane ❤️
It’s true that believing in conspiracy theories doesn’t mean you’re stupid

But it’s also true that believing vaccines cause autism or global warming is fake means you’re extremely extremely stupid
They don't??
What happens when you're on acid and high?
20% believing vaccines cause autism is so high it's scary
oh yea like russian collusion ?
Can they do one of these for religion
Great Video!
(((
How many eyes do u want
Is he from Big Brother???
Why is there a whiteboy in the thumbnail?
Conspiracies exist and some are the truth but what can you, a civilian with no authority and im guessing little to no money do against them?  Nothing. So live your life, shut up and let them rule the world.
Proof that Shane Dawson is part of the Illuminati.
DONT LISTEN TO THIS PIG WITH HIS HAND SYMBOLS YOUR NOT BRAINWASHING ME
I dont believe in any!!
I just hate it when people believe something and take it as absolute and irrevocable truth even it's just ridiculous and crazy and implausible... And they just won't change their minds for the life of them no matter how many explanations and evidences are given. And everything is a conspiracy for them!!!! ¬¬
What IS the illuminati? I don't understand what it is or its meaning AT ALL.
You know evolution and the Big Bang isn’t proven to be true!
Wohoooooo
Lol
Why is one of your sources about schizotypal personality disorder? Thought no one would look through them?
You can’t tell me 9/11 wasn’t known by the us government. There’s literally over 25 “coincidences” that happened in that event.
Plot Twist: Asap Science is full of reptilians
Why are the chucky cheese pizzas like that.
Shane has left the chat
2:46 = mental illness
Great video guys.
Anyone only click because they saw Shane.
So are hardcore Christians conspiracy theorists or is it due to being brought up in an alternate reality? By that I mean that they were taught that the Bible is factual while scientists are the conspiracy theorists? I've been wondering about that because I know people who are very factual when it comes to the news and don't believe in the classic 911 or lizard people conspiracies, but they still have the "I'm not a monkey" rhetoric.
Oh shut up you sell out. You guys make me sick.
clearly the lizard people have paid these guys off...typical
Ok, keep injecting aluminium and mercury into your bloodstream, dumbest channel I’ve ever seen. Your the minority in your country who won’t wake up.
Who the heck is this Shane guy?
So does watching this video about conspiracies mean YouTube will recommend conspiracy videos to me? Because if they do, I’m clicking ‘Not interested’
Aren’t the DNC running a satanic pedophilia ring in Comet Pizza in DC?
YEET
oh hey shane 2.0
"Believing in conspiracy theories doesn't mean you're stupid."

Yes, it does.
fake video
Why does Shane Dawson exist
Welove.ro is woke 999x888
I try not to subscribe to many conspiracy theories myself, but my sister got taken in by the conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney secretly died in a car crash in the 60s and was replaced by a doppelganger, after having watched an in-depth "documentary" on the subject.
The crazy part is that this is actually a very scientific based video, yet reading the comments, the majority are still unmoved by the facts presented on this video. It’s very telling and makes me sad that as Americans, we fall prey to conspiracies. Hell even our President is exempt from believing in conspiracies.
Skr
why do so many people think it is wrong to vaccinate yourself it is the stupidest thing I've heard in ages!
DOG - "You work to buy a house, pay my vet bills, and buy me food. I lay around the house snoozing and licking myself. WHO'S dumb?"
C'mon....recycled chuck e cheese is NOT a conspiracy theory....ASAP science is a conspiracy theory against conspiracy theory! Stop the proliferation of lies!!!
Lemmebo
Whoops that's fact
Simple, because idiots exists
Go back
These two guys are brainwashed
In5d.com
This vid is part of the dumb down..fancy words and making people feel stupid if you have a different opinion..these 2 are bull they are no different-just a different view but make out you are stupid..so i am right or smug
3:56 “even tho there’s no solid evidence”

3:58 shows solid evidence 🤦🏻‍♂️
But you haven't addressed the fact that conspiracies exist and have happened in history. You're redefining the word "conspiracy theory" into something alot simpler and stupid
So believe everything a guy on TV tells me because.... government? Okay, sure.
Shane has joined the chat
Are your dogs really dumb though? You’re measuring their intelligence on a human scale. And dogs aren’t the ones that are killing the planet so they’re doing something right lmao
Oh, so yeah, some Americans think global warming doesn’t exist? Well, explain this; I’m in Canada, so some of you might think this is normal, but clearly, it isint. So, the last few nights, it’s been snowing. Yeah, snowing, in MAY. A lot of Americans think Canada is famous for being cold, but it’s actually not that bad (atleast not where I am). So, yeah, if it’s snowing, in the middle of spring, you gotta see somethings not right here.
Duh, religion
that's because americans are stupid 0:35
Because someone is stupid
Yeah whatever! 
That’s what “They” want you to think!  
Wake up sheeple
God exists
5:03 Oh god... I'm sorry but that cringey, diva way he moves ruins everything for me...
There is no scientific consensus around global warming. Stop spreading misinformation
Conspiracy theories only work when Alex Jones is the one narrating them.
Conspiracy theory. Climate change  casued by humans. Please tell me more how humans stopped the ice age before. The earth has hot and cold period, its not us. Its just patters like shark attacks and Ice cream sales look connected. Its called summer, one does not cause the other.
Of course they choose the most outlandish "conspiracy theories" of them all. Like really lizard people, really. How about talking about how 9/11 was a controlled demolition and theres NO footage of the Pentagon getting hit, or about operation northwoods or about the patents for brainwash technology, or how there is poision in our tap water and toothpaste, or  about how the governor of Virginia LITERALLY admitted that he is a baby organ harvester. I mean c'mon you guys obviously were bought out to make this video or you guys are just really idiotic
Like religion
shane shane shane
Yeah we ain’t debt slaves. The new world order has never been talked about. The hellfire club ain’t real. Millions of children don’t go missing. Cps don’t take kid’s & tragic them & Satanism & the dark occult ruling in America ain’t researchable or real. lol Operation paperclip ain’t real. Being sold to Zionist bankers & vaccines in test been shown to cause issues ignored & yes may be effective but so is Advil but they also created diseases to give to natives so how great they make money off diseases & bad heath conditions they created & have never talked about using food or water to control us. Guess the fluoride in the waters a lie & being owned by a evil hierarchy is false. Of course they will make fake conspiracy theories to keep the real evil truth out. Ask a veteran how evil government is & maybe you’ll see the stupid conspiracies no on cares about. It’s the ones I’ve said can’t be dare said ain’t true & have plenty of proof.
I never watched any of the Shane conspiracy video, so this was my first time seeing any footage from it. Was it designed to make you think it was a conspiracy itself? Because don't you need a kid to be able to get in to Chuck E Cheese? And, without any context, they're just creepily hanging out with a camera that doesn't appear to be hidden and an employee casually walks past them and does whatever. If it was a real employee, whats the possibility he was just checking on these grown adults, hanging out in a place for kids, with a video camera? What if its not even really a Chuck E Cheese and the employee and the Chuck E Cheese are both fake? Does Shane really run a pedophile ring in the basement of fake pizza place? If not kiddies, perhaps kitties. Maybe a kitty petting zoo? Why do you think they need a fake mouse? Its obviously to attract poor unsuspecting kitties. For them to pet, iykwim.
Does the way the glasses guy talks piss anyone else off?
One of my problems with the anti-vax mindset is that since they refuse to vaccinate their kids because they think vaccines cause autism, that means they think the risk of getting autism is more abhorrent than the risk of their child dying from horrible diseases. Basically, these people would rather their kids die than be autistic, which is so supremely shitty a mindset I don't even have the heart to address it. Yeah, having autism sucks sometimes (speaking from experience), but hey, at least autistic people can still live their lives and have jobs and friends and shit.
Yo
The entire Democratic party belives in a conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia
please stop talking in a feminine way
It amazes me when dumb people think they're smart just because they created a youtube channel about "science" or "pseudoscience" . 😏
So the earth is not always changing and going through different stages of temps? So Summer is bad and global warming is not a HOAX? I was lied to by everyone about the 4 seasons then.
Conspiracy theories are also free speech tho so it seems wrong that these media platforms are demonetizing and silencing them
Illuminati Exists ; Do A Fckin Research ! They Are Fkin Up You Through Central Banking , Brainwashing Through Media. Just 2 Examples.
This video appears to me to basically do two things:
1. Inhibit each and any actual and productive discussion about important topics (e.g. vaccines) by exclusively showing "opinions" of the greatest idiots found on the internet, generalizing the entire topic into ridiculousness (both literally and figuratively)
2. Downgrading each and every "theory" as someone falling to their most primitive instincts, being deceived or misinformed, therefore suggesting that no theory about people in positions of power having misused them without telling the public has ever been true.

I am fully aware I am making myself the ridicule of all your fanboys jumping in to your defence as well as everyone who dismisses anything as soon as he hears the word "conspiracy" mentioned somewhere - please knock yourself out, just don't expect any response - but for anyone else: Always be cautious when it comes to extremes - be it "everything is conspired" or be it "nothing ever is"
bill cipher has been spotted, i repeat, bill cipher HAS BEEN SPOTTED
The most commonly believed conspiracy theory is global warming
Conspiracies are real, anyone who says otherwise Cleary hasnt done enough reseach on it. Simple
“Conspiracy theories” aren’t bad; they’re just theories. Even if they’re not true, they promote open-mindedness and scientific thinking.
Another way to say:
Some humans are stupid
AsapSCIENCE is CLEARLY in the illuminati now... GREAT
asap science is part of the illuminati CONFIRMED
But Earth is flat
If you don’t believe in at least one conspiracy you should probably do some research
To clarify: I'm not an anti vaxxer nor do I believe vaccines cause autism. I was developing well according to my mum, was like any other child... but after taking the MMR vaccine (three vaccines at the same time) my mum noticed a difference in my development and upon getting me tested, I was found to be autistic. What my mum reckons is that taking THREE VACCINES AT ONCE can TRIGGER autism in SUSCEPTIBLE people.

The capitalization was to emphasize that my mum and I know that vaccines don't cause autism, and I will still get my children vaccinated when I have them.
Our government has a special trust (National Vaccine Compensation Fund) that sets money aside for families who's kids get sick and or die from vaccinations. Since it's inception in 1988, it's paid out over $4.1 billion dollars. 
But vaccines are safe right?
Russia collusion and obstruction is a conspiracy theory.
Because most conspiracies are true and your corporate globalist overlords paint these people as crazy. Jews are disproportionately over represented in media, finance, legal, political, business, and the wealthy. Watch my comment vanish for daring to mention the JQ.
Excited to finally release a NEW SONG! Hope you guys like this one - it just happened to line up with the release of the first ever black hole image coming out. How exciting!!
Thanks as always for supporting us and sharing these videos to help inspire the world into liking science :)
You’ve successfully combined my love of science with my love for music and I am actually cryying 😍😭
1:42 I reaaalllyy enjoyed and impressed how you really used Gaga's hand on face, I mean.. The detail! Just Wow!
science teacher: you have less than 4 minutes to learn about stars
me:
Just in time for the black hole reveal Tomorrow!
OK YOU MADE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SONGS INTO SCIENCE AND ITS NICE!!!!!! 💞💞💞
When that supernova happened. Damn. That got me
My god ....it's so good. Thanks for the recommendation YouTube!
When a star is born, the universe doesn’t care because there are trillions of stars already

Feels bad man
Is it weird that the guitar-playing star made me want to cry?
Can you do a parody about electromagnetism, a level standard? Don't mind what song, just make it catchy and soooon please🙏🏻
OMG I love this song.
I was need this song.
I love u so much guys ❤❤❤
Forever Little Monster ❤
2:45 when i put on too much highlighter XD
Lady Gaga definitely need to see this. @LadyGaga 😂😂😂😂
Where was this a few weeks ago when I was studying for my astronomy test... I could have really used this to raise my grade😂
Such a beautiful song!! I love the vocals!!

ASAP Science is my favorite way to revise for science!
(I might try to get my science teacher to play this as well)
Do you ever think about how lonely stars get? They are so so far away from each other...😥😭
Usually i'm not a fan of science music videos but this one is great :D
Amazing!! Loved the supernova layers, also the Japanese cartoon style. 😍 It was super great!! 👏👏
I never thought I would cry from seeing a star exploding. I would rather be blind
I love this ❤️😍! They both have such a good voice.
Dude your voices are amazing 😍😍
The girl voice had shocked me first thought that came to my mind was "Gregory can sing a song in a girl voice too "
This was so well thought out. I'm blown away. Good job, you guys. The lyrics were really amazing!
That was different, but I liked it.  Good work.
Amazing concept..... 🔥👌😍❤
Why am I crying? That's so beautiful, their voices
you really know how to save my physics GCSE
Yo this gotta be my nerdy jam !
I cried.  


I find the death of stars very sad. It makes me think about are mortality.
So did she become a black hole or neutron star??
I still don't know anything new about stars but I liked the song
LOL. I thought this was gonna be a theory video but it turned out to be a song
But damn, well done 👏👏
On the one hand, this explains the birth in a hilarious way, on the other hand this explanation shows perfectly the exact metaphor of Ally being born a star in the film. Most important to me that not many will end up being an actual star and not everybody will shine bright as a metaphor for finding the sense of life
The ending was sad when she disappears
You could've made her into a new star
You should do a concert asap use (the periodic table of elements song and this one )
Ahh I love this! Best birthday present ever 🥰🎉
I've been following this channel for years and I can't stop loving they're videos <3
What about when a star collapses upon itself and becomes a black hole
Thank you for this wonderful parody, I don't know how but I love more each new one you make. They are incredible, you have such talent!! 😍😍😍😍
It’s gonna blow 😂😂😂 
SUPERNOVA
The actual "A Star is Born", nice job 👍🏼
i cry to this more than to the original version
Ssummary of this video
☁️-🌞-🌀-☁️
Wait that girl’s voice is FIRE 🔥 🔥
That was awesome! Good job! Voices amazing!
I love both science and A Star is Born so this made my day :D
(00:18)
The second star to the first star: IT'S MA'AM
Marvelous! Thank you for that!
Can you do a video on keto?? Please😊
If you see this, I think you should make some sort of video on the recent Black Hole discovery and image. On another note, this is such a great video and really well done!
THIS. IS. EPIC. 
I love it!! ❤
My question: is magic real? If not, why? 
PS I like this song, good job !🦄🌸👍
I love space
My teacher put this on and I just started crying
Why am I crying over a combusting cloud of atoms ? 😭😭😭
Love the song Shallow. Interesting parody👍🏻
2:01 awww!!!
This was strangely beautiful
I had to tell one of my coworkers that the Sun is a star. He's an adult with children and a college degree. 

Next time a subject like that comes up I'm going to think of this beautiful song to keep my brain from going supernova.
I got goose bumps at the star's death 😍😭😂
That was pretty cool. Great singing too!
I'm crying it was beautiful 😂😢
Being honest, I didn't expect to like it, but I was singing along by the end. Great job! Very compelling story! Keep up the great work!
" JUNTOS E SHALOW NOW " ;-;
Wow... this sounds really good
I learn more from Them than at school
10/10 would listen again
Couple of million years later:

A black hole is born
I cannot express in words how lucky I consider myself to be a subscriber of Asap Science
It's Soo BEAUTIFUL😍😍
This is more emotional than shallow I’m crying 😢
Fantastic😍 
Very good playing skills for the sun...👏👏
The song would've gotten dark if the star had turned into a black hole.
2:18 NANI?!?!?
I have a question.







What makes hydrogen and what is the thing that makes hydrogen and what is the thing that makes the thing that makes hydrogen thingand what is the the thing that make the other thing that makes the thing that makes hydrogen.

Simple question😁
Someone is looking for a grammy...
That girl's voice !!  😍😍
This is the best thing ever!!!! My mind n ears couldn't be any happier!!!
Truly beautiful ~
That was gorgeous, everyone! She has an absolutely beautiful voice with impressive control. I loved the animation too!
Gonna shout it from the mountaintops
A star is born
It's a time for pulling out the stops
A star is born
Honey, hit us with a hallelu'
The kid came shining through
Girl, sing the song
Come blow your horn
A star is born
When you have a science presentation about astronomy but you watched A Star is Born the day before.
Omg I love that LITERALLY
(conflict between every country)
This just made my day. Best combo ever
ahaha damn nice job ASAP science!
OMGG Lady Gaga definately needs to see it))
Perfect 😍
Wow, science can be so beautiful! 😍
I can't find word to appreciate it this video really touched my heart    and ya I didn't know that Mitchell is such a great singer I really get fascinated by this
GCSE Physics revision for anyone else?!
There’s hydrogen and helliu... oops
Damn wrong song
Woah I had no idea mitch could sing that good o: Kalie's voice is also so pretty and powerful!
Damn.... amazing singing! Keep it up :D
May the star 🌟 actually dies many years ago but we can see it  till now. The light from that still help us just like the great scientists may they had died off bt still there theory helps us
The collapsed star turns into a blackhole.

His friends all died.

The end.
Wait a second..... In space no air.....how we r listening to their song.....😂😂..like 👍👍
Genius! I need to play this for my students!
Haha I love this!!! 😊👌🏾🤭😁
I'm surprised she didn't turn into a black hole :v
Who sings this?? Whoever it is, there literally amazing!
This is 10000x better than the original
That Manga reference though! That supernova death made me cry 😭
You guys are super! I like your songs and i learned something new in one video! Thanks for keep doing it every video. Keep going!

Simply genius
This is underrated. I LOVED THIS
Please make a cover of the real version as well
What a burn!? I really think this is how a "star" is born. LOL
Absolutely Brilliant!!
I think AsapScience should do a rap song to.
This is by far one of the best things I’ve seen on YouTube😂
Whoa

MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHOULD SEE THIS
Amazing.... extraordinary work....i love science and the shallow song ..
.. fortune,...😍
I love how you can’t tell if I Video was made 8 years ago or yesterday xD
What I never learned in thousand classes, I learned in a 3:40 minutes vídeo
OMG this was put together very well and the words were fitted perfectly into the lyrics!!😍
I’m crying!!! Literally like this is beautiful!!!
I can't wait the AsapScience complete album!
Ok but that was so beautiful,wasn't expecting to be that good either ways
Suddenly, in nebula (this after star death) there is something forming... THOSE ARE PLANETS! Gas giants, rocky planets, dwarfs, rings and moons come into play, then asteroids bring new things to them: water, RRE, aminoacids, etc. Then the true fun begins - life borns! During evolution process, inteligent life forms and begin to create and discover new tools, energy sources, materials and transport, finally they can answer the question 'what is sky' and they begin to send rockets, satelites and probes, finally being able to travel other planets, the flat earth society comes and their level of knowledge is low like in medival.
Perfection 💕💕💕💕
This is actually pretty cool 😍😍❤️❤️😎😎
Why your guitar only has 4 strings?
Ohh the Lady Gaga song!
Not gonna lie, very nice song, but a bit dissapointed it's not the one from Disney's Hercules
This is hilarious and I am reminded why I love this channel
3:13

The universe could not stand this lack of awesomeness and created you
This is beautiful 🤩
That was kind of heartbreaking

Early :3
lolol, this made me giggle.
This is amazing, please more science musical parodies!
I wish you did a behind the scenes of this 😂 it would be so cool
Nice voice but bull-poop.
I love the songs ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
2 - Sunny see’s Stella be born

Lol after listening to your podcast on the Oscars I am surprised you made this!
I feel bad for the sun
y'all are so talented it's ridiculous
That was actually pretty beautiful! Love the science
Excellent job!!! Well done!! After a supernova it'll be a neutron star or a black hole instead of cloud of dust , isn't it?
BAHAHAHA BEST THING IVE SEEN ALL DAY
This is amazzzzzzing 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The universe could not stand this lack of awesomeness and created you
Omg I love all the parody of shallow cheers and thanks for letting me learn about our sun at the same time hehe
Yup, time for me to go to bed
Mary (Me): *sings this song along with the Science Love Song*
My teacher: Wait, that’s illegal! You are under arrest for singing things about science... just kidding.
THIS IS AMAZING
this is a rlly cute song ngl
I’m going to use this as a video for my class.
That is awesome, very clever well done!
IT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG WHILE!
This is so cutie!!!! I really love how accessible and easy to remember these musical parodies are, I hope somewhere a teacher is showing your videos to their science students!
I absolutely LOVE this song!!!!! Thank you so so much ❤️❤️⚛️🌟
Wow. This was really great.
The song was beautiful, greetings from Europe.
underrated
`
Very well done.
Why ? Why do you have to kill the female star....? It hurts 😭 stars have a family too 😭
So smart 😂👏
This is what education should be like!!!
Pft this song is basically the song Lava with the two volcanoes just 2.0
Well, that’s just brilliant!
Whoever this "Lady Gaga" person is stole your song and changed the lyrics without giving you credit.
Best parody ever, very educational and catchy lol
This is so dumb but yet so brilliant at the same time
2:18 start comic 
2:34 finish comic
Omygosh this is actual life literally
Lol !!!! It's always fun to watch your video.
omg lol I love this channel
haha Love it!!
It would be super funny if when the star went super nova, heavy metal started and all the planets that watched would burn :D
Those Red Dwarfs look more like Red Blood Cells 😊
Best birthday present ever!! 🥰🎉🎉
Aw this is so cute❤😭
The best video ever Loved it
Better than the original <3
never thought I'd feel sad after watching a science video
hey, i got a question. can u make a videos on "What is Einstein's theory of relativity in a nutshell." I am doing a project on this in school so I would appreciate it if u could make a video like this. BTW, I love all ur videos. They make learning so much fun.
Loved it even more then the Original one #yassqueen😊😊😊
1:20 ... Correction: A few thousand years.
Damn that was dope
why did this actually give me shivers lmao
The made me feel so sad for some weird reason 😢
I got fricking CHILLS from this
Ok, but can we just appreciate what a good singer Mitch is?
We watched this in science yesterday and everyone was saying it looked like anime 😂
What, no verse for the stellar remnant? I want to hear a black hole / neutron star singing next!
Damn, this is so cute😭
Beautiful and sad. I feel bad for boy star now.
2:43 I can't support my mass STORY OF MY LIFE
Lady Gaga should sing this in live.
Can you do a video on abortions?
yo I really needed this thanks ⭐
Mind blowing ❤️❤️❤️❤️

So cool 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve watched this too many times
This is too clever for its own good !
IT WAS AMAZING and a rly good combaniton of science and one of the most awsome song = KABOOM WITH SHOCK
This is so amazing 😍
Just beautiful
Omg hahaha I just saw this movie two days ago 🤣
When I first heard the title: A star is born I actually thought that is was about a star being born 😂😂
I got an A+ on my physics class because of this
in my country... be supernova it's like you're too young
Could have been extended to black hole 🕳️
Your vedios are so cool and fun. Love for science. Even I want to take the science stream  in future
Why is this so beautiful
Better than the actual song
Wow, I have no idea you could sing this well.  Gave me the goosies.
I am soooo happy ypu used Ne and Si and He not NE, SI and HE
Yess yesss YESSSS YESSSS
can you please make a video about glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd) thanks like if you want 1 too
this is so genuine and if 100 people in a room dont think its funny, only 1 person will believe its funny. 😂
Thank you!These songs are amazing!And the science too!
can someone tell why i cried? LMFAOOO
Omgaga this is genius❤️
I never thought of a supernova as something dramatic and emotional until now
Now I want to become a star
GENIUUUUUUUS

Top ten saddest anime deaths
I love this channel ❤❤❤❤
beautiful, but i expected something more energetic or a song with fast bits.
It is also when 2 stars collide with each other.
LOVE U GUYS
The Internet will never cease to amaze me
This was strangely touching
I❤Science
Who says, science can’t be poetic...😄
Just beautiful
Just beautiful
Give up your day job!  That was great.  Where were you guys back when I was teaching grade school science 40 years ago?  OH! Ya. Don't answer that.  ;-)
It's a great song buts it's not perfectly accurate because when a star dies it dosnt go into a cloud of dust for like another many years
I saw a ad before the vid of the original music
I need more educational music
Lol, this got sad real quick
A star is born and then a star is dead. It was emotional, dude
2:18 top 10 saddest anime deaths
Now I realize how great Lady Gaga sang
I was, inside, crying about the death of the star until the cute derpy face of that dust cloud popped up. I was just at awe. Damn good video.
That's why i love this channel
You're not early, you're on time
HERE BEFOE VIRAL!
I feel like this is something theyd show us in science class
Ain't it gonna turn into a black hole??
This is the reason why Youtube is made! Creativity and information in one video.
This is really quiet i like this
By far ur best song I love it
what are you doing with that poor papers
Thats, just uh, 
This is amazing
A love story that lasts millions of years
Why I love this 😂😂😂
I was waiting for a black hole. I am disappointed.
10/10 really likes this :)
WHY DO WE CLOSE OUR EYES WHEN WE SNEZZE
this is so nerdy. i love it
Amazing 😍
B R I L L I A N T!
Thought it would be cringe but it was pretty good
This is beautiful
Omg I am so early
I love this so much 😂
That was amazing!
It's beautiful  ;')

Oml yes!!!
Apollo just came out of the sun to sing us straight up facts
Hey there science I have 2 question what happens if you pop your ears a lot and is it harmful to have a very fast metabolism? Thx
This is just brilliant...
This video confirms that there is life after death
THIS WAS SO GOOD
Lady Gaga is gonna destabilize
Can you do videos on pseudoscientific claims like The Secret Law of Attraction and Occultism and all that stuff?
Can u do a song on like enzymes, photosynthesis or osmosis ? To help me and other for our GCSEs
Plz do this question if you didn't already!!!- Is water wet?
I see what you did at the end there. In the movie he dies and in this she dies...
This is ... Beautiful
Wait, two stars cant be that close together...
Wow. Just wow.
The talent jumped out
Great superb excellent song! The animation is cute but very unconvincing. I wish it was more realistic! Would have been great.
🎵 🎵 I miss the old asapscience 
 Good smart and bold asapscience, 
Straight from the soul asapscience , 
set on his goals asapscience 
I hate the asapscience , the bad content asapscience, 
The always boring asapscience , bad like the news asapscience 🎵🎵
That's so cool!!! ✔️✔️✔️
This is amazing, i hope you guys do more video like this
10/10.
I'm early!!
This is honestly helping me pass science
First.
Hey after a star goes Supernova it might turn into a black hole
This is brilliant!
I dont know how i ended up being here but I'm glad i did
How do scientists calculate the distance between space objects? I request you to make a video on this.
I cried while watching this.
i never knew you live in canada, i thought you live in the us
I thought it would be the Hercules “a star was born* :/
Good song except the star being happy rather than being traumatized is kinda unexpected lol jk I like it
AMAZING!🌟
this is beautiful
Im high rn and this is the funniest and most educating thing ive ever seen in my life
This is really good! 😃
Going to share this with my teacher friends.
Definitely better than the real one ! 😍😍😹✨✨✨✨✨✨👌🏼
Amazing!! <3
2:36 MEEEEE
Just imagine Gaga singing I'm supernova on stage
That was so stinking cute!!!
🌞...
Im not sure what to feel about this...
This version is better than the original one
Bravo! Encore!
Love your parodies 😅🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩
Omg masterpiece
It sounds...romantic?
Is it unhealthy to sleep with the window open?
I’m low key sobbing
I love it! But that transition at 1:00 scared the hell out of me 😅
2:34 top ten saddest anime deaths
I actually learned things through this song!
This song is so underrated and needs more views
If its the star explowd  where is black bole?
song, which is so beautiful and thrilling, shouldn't be named a parody... great job!
Now I'm wondering why the boi didn't end it's life cycle...
I LOVE this😍
What is you take sleeping pills and coffee at the same time
I would 10/10 buy tickets to this concert
Is it normal that a totally nerdy song made me feel moved? T_T Congrats, you hurted me...
Donald trump?
hi i want my heart
this is perfect
This. Was. Beautiful.
I thought you edit it
This gave me shivers
Phenomenal.

Why did this song make me 😢 Sad
I’m showing this to my science teacher
I love how you guys transform a song into an educational song😍😍😍. Love you allllllll
Wow 
very nice 
video😍😍😍😍😍😍
red dwarf: whut?
white dwarf: dont care about it
red dwarf:cool i made cli
we love gcse physics
I hate this in a good way
that was lit
If I were student in previous time and got this video to learn
This was wonderful
Best channel ever
I am crying
this is extremely hilarious and educational video if there was more videos like this more kids be interested in since
That’s basically the best thing I’ve seen in youtube
legit the first star singing looks like trump dont kill me
I DIDN’T EXPECT IT TO BE SAD
Awesome guys, Congrats!
I'm surprised by how good the singing is wow
Why did this make me emotional???
CORE CHANGE
Omg this vid is gold
Can you make a video on, The Science behind repeating a word so many times, it doesn’t sound like a word anymore.
HOW GOOD
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wooo early :3
World question: Is there god or not???????
NAH! A star is CORN
Love it 💙💝💛🎵🎼🎶
This shit it's real man
AsapSCIENCE always making nice Parodies. If I had a kid, I would buy an album from them so my kid can listen to it. Teach them young.
I’m so glad this showed up in my recommendations. This is a great nerdy music video ❤️
I haven't seen the movie but man I liked this video!
just love it <3
you could make a religion out of this
This is my revision
wow thats cool
I'm feeling bad now. #prayforthesupernova
Actually I clicked thinking it was a parody of A star is born by Hercules, but this is much much better
Beautifully written.
Education as entertainment for me
wow thats so adorable
the best songs to learn.  LOL.  I love this one!
=DDDD
That was extremely creative
Still a better love story than Twilight....?
Have they done a video of why people can't punch in their sleep?
Now I just look like the female star looks like Medusa...
time to study for my regents
This is huge! Hahahaha.. great!
I just downloaded it to my phone
who else was laughing at the mouth shapes they were pulling?
THIS WAS JUST TOO AWESOME.
Some how you made a star is born good

I love this I love all your songs
What is sea foam, what is it composed of and how is it made?
I can’t wait for science teachers to start using this vid for their classes
i love this so much
I dream of a world where Lady whoever's song is a parody of these types of songs.
When stars sing better than you
Excelente, ciência todo dia.
AAAA I LOVE THISSSSS
a star can sing better than me
Why is this actually good??
we'll shine
How amazing sooooooooooooong
❤❤❤
Nice song 
I Like it
I was so excited to see tbe image of a black hole to be released this week...then this video was released, quite entertaining.
amazing! the talent
Using this as revision bc it’s part of the spec oof
I got chills
To be honest it is really bad
astrophysics nerdasm
oh my god.literally oh my god.
why do i see a comic in this song
when you want to be a singer but your parents want you to be a scientist.
Although this is a parody it's very useful if you're studying this in high school
I LOVE THIS
how if the born is star?
WIG IS SNATCHED
Why am i crying
2:25 I don't feel so good
Who was the boy singer?
Just when I thought I was over this song
Why is this so beautiful and sad 😢😢
I’m cringing so hard omg
:D
The ending is sad
1000000000/10!!!!!!
Alternate ending to the movie: the star with the female voice dies in this video. Interesting detail!
Beautiful
.............No comment







Oh wait this is a comment

Has a south park animation to it ;)
WoodCock OMG like in morning wood? No offense no offense but that's the first thought that came to my evil mind. So sorry so sorry! ROTFFLMAO!!!!
Sublime!
WOW!...
This is GREAT!
We want more songs 😍😍😍
Okay but why did I cry???
I can’t tell if this is cringey or beautiful so I’m just gonna say it’s awesome
This song is making me cry.
love the animation 😉

SO GOOD
Awesome!!!
Yea, that is cool and all, but stars can't talk.
aww r.i.p star gaga
anybody who disliked this is a blackhole
What an informative song
Really, really clever!
2:42 is me
Are there more than 1 sun like star and can you name them and if there are planets bigger the the sun that no one know about accept for siyentis
Wasn’t a fan of this song until now
Yay a star is born
This is awesome and will make an amazing learning aid for kids too! Great work.
Good job, all!

Hey Asap, there is this song called Lady Gaga - Shallow and it sounds almost identical to your song. I think that she copied you.
My class loves the movie and of course this song. I'm sure this would be very very interesting for them
Please let my teacher find this
PERFEITO LINDO
Loved it
😍
🇳🇵
Wow nice song 😍
Isn't it wrong to say that the star is burning in space? SInce burning involves oxygen?
Omg this is soooooooo GOOD!!!!!!!!!
Nice one lol👍👍
Baby shark, thank u, next.
😂😂😂
Actually no scientists can say that the forming of a star can be observed. And called scientific.

Stars only fall. And explode. No star is regenerated. No star is born.

And billions of years? Nope. This universe does not have more than 6000 years.
Amazing
Thats awesome
That was great
So cute!!!!!

Who is singing?
i have a question. coming from a girl who dramatically cries over stupid tests, why do we sniff when we cry?
What about a star collapsing into itself
Oh ummm k

yay
I like this song. Then again, I like all of ASAPScience’s songs and videos. :)

Why isn't anyone talking about Mitch's vocals? Well done you guys. The lyrics were great, but as a former professional musician I was deep into the vocals. What a great tone and melodies in this one :)
HUUUUUUUUGE missed opportunity to not have Trisha sing the female part.
I want to be at the top comment.

Stupid video
Nice
Awesome parody 👍🏻you guys are awesome. Love from India 💖
Im
You guys should another version of this, but with "Star is Born" from Hercules. I would love  to see how you would sing that song.

 Also you guys have awesome voices
Lol I did not expect this to be so good 
They were such beautiful voices ❤
What a beautiful video with such a beautiful song! Good job guys.
I don't like how they open their mouth with "glow"
Makes me feel uncomfortable 
Otherwise great video
k
That's sooo beautiful wow... i literally cried . Good job
She has a pretty voice and some good techniques such as vibrato but i dont think this song choice was good for her, she’d be better doing something more pretty and low rather than something that requires power and soul. She just has a different style. 
It felt like she was singing quiet and had many retakes where they edited and increased volume etc
Nice but I am not fan of the original song ;)
Wait did you just say energy can be made? My teacher said that can't happen.
A star is made not born wooo
Better than the actual song, in my opinion
Better than the real thing
I don't know but for me this was cringy (yes I know probobly it took more than 24h to make this but still)
For a brief moment, I thought the character was Trump. Oh dear.
I actually hate this song, but at least you guys made good lyrics for it! :)
kind of sad and depressing... I love it
I remember when these songs taught me stuff, I studied star cycle last year, a lot was missed out but it's still a cute animation
What happened to this channel? Dear lord!
When are the actual science videos coming back?
wasn't he supposed to be pulled into the inside of her eaten? since she became a black hole? you are not sciencing enough ...
He dies in the end of the movie
One problem this song is called shallow, a star is born is the film
Spoiler alert he dies
ah yes this video drops right before my flight
Fun fact: you're more likely to die on the way to the airport than when on the plane
Forcing pilots to work excessive hours causes them to make critical mistakes... imagine that,,,
1 in every 16 million flights crashes? That says it all, flying is INSANELY safe.
Planes crash Because Science.
Oh crap, wrong channel.
BECAUSE PLANES HAVE NO EYES
In my previous life, I was actually a bird who flew into the plane's engine.
The safest form of transportation (in terms of total distanced traveled vs people killed) is actually an elevator :~)
I have the same abilities as that kid from Final Destination, so I'm fine bro...
0:42 That's true. My flight instructor wasn't very good. 
I'd ask him a question and he'd say, "Just wing it."
Let's not forget that in 2017 there weren't any commercial flight crash.
fun fact: My parents are against me getting a drivers licence but are for the idea for me getting a pilots licence. LMAO
"Switch seats?" "No way"
I read that as "Switch deaths?"
I'll give you two reasons

1. Something's wrong with the left phalange
2. The plane has no phalange

If you get it we can be friends.
Something wrong with left falangy!!!
Because gravity doesn’t like SOME planes
Why am I watching this... our flight is boarding... why....
If people have more chance to survive when they are seated on the back of the plane, then they should place all seats in the back of the plane. And while we are at this, they should make the plane out of the same material as the black box.
See? I just saved the life of thousands of people with a simple reasonning. Now, give me my nobel price!





NB: If you're not sure...  I'm joking.
Not sure if this was suppose to ease or feed my paranoia.. 😅
In the Air France flight you mentioned, flight 447, the pitot tubes did ice over, however the pilot that had the controls at the time was to blame for the crash. He inexplicably pulled back on the stick and, despite the stall warning sounding for 54 seconds indicating he should point the nose down, stalled a perfectly flyable aircraft all the way into the ocean.
69% chance of survival IN THE BACK?!
Well you know what they were doing...
Really shouldnt be watchin this before my flight in 2 weeks, but I'm genuinely curious 🙂
Pitot is pronounced PEE-toh just to let you know, good video tho
AsapSCIENCE & HAI uploading a video about planes on the same day at the same time.  
Coincidence?  Probably!  lol
But we still don't know what happened to MH370.
If the front seat is more dangerous, then why are first class so expensive...? 🤔
How can planes crash if they don’t exist?
Damn, highest sabotage occurrences is in China??? Who would’ve thought.
Not only am I too broke to EVER fly first class and sit in the front, economy class can possibly save my life in the event of an accident! One of the upsides of being poor I guess lol
If you want to survive the plane crash... Start singing:

🎵He start the whole world, in his hands...🎵
is flying to America in August
Me: 'let's watch this video!'
It seems like birds are attracted to plane engines
I recommend XPilot's YouTube channel for those interested in this stuff
travel? i rather stay home and watch this. thanks
Why do airplanes crash? Simple, excessive vertical velocity at the point of landing. If that vertical velocity is higher than the air frame is designed to withstand, then the aircraft is damaged and the landing is called a crash.
       While airplanes are more than 1000 times safer than driving (per mile traveled) IF there is a crash, you will most likely survive. The VAST majority of accidents are completely non-fatal.
     If it seems like every time you hear about an accident, consider that unless there is a fatality, or the accident happened because of unusual circumstances, it is unlikely to be reported in anything more than local news.
     So, while you usually only hear about fatal accidents, remember that you don't really hear about most accidents.
Literally nobody:


Some guy: THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WING!!
Ok you gotta upload this 6 days before my flight. YouTube just tries to give me anxiety.
Kinda weird I was on that exact same 737 a month before it crashed in Ethiopia
Why planes crash short answer: 
Why Planes Sometimes Crash?
Pilot: Umm..
I leave for Basic tomorrow morning (which I'm already nervous for btw) then I see this video pop up randomly which doesn't help lol, I think Youtube is trying to tell me something...
Simple... because they land to quickly.
thank you so much. im never riding on a plane again. 🙃
tl;dr

cuz
Or... Because something's wrong w/ the left phalange... 😉
A FEW CORRECTIONS AND CONTEXTUAL ADDITIONS:

>>0:30 "A majority of the accidents are due to the pilot losing control, or controlled flight into terrain, meaning the pilot didn't see the ground, a mountain, or another obstacle until it was too late."


Okay, so, you combined 2 things together that are separate categories. "Loss of control" refers to  things like the pilot aerodynamically stalling the aircraft or the pilot not sufficiently compensating for the wind and being blown off the side edge of a runway. "Controlled flight into terrain" is when everything aerodynamically is perfectly fine with the airplane, but the pilot was unaware of their proximity to terrain or obstacles, which usually occurs inside of clouds, in poor visibility, or at night.

Regarding the "gust lock" incidents, gust locks can either be co-located with the controls, or they can be installed on the exterior flight control surfaces. The pilots in that case didn't have time to "stop the flight" in a safe manner because it was too late - they had already taken off and there isn't enough reaction time to disconnect the gust lucks in that case - you're just dead. Not only do our checklists tell us remove the gust lock, but we also always move our controls to their fullest extent before takeoff to ensure they are "free and correct," meaning that nothing is hindering their movement (they are free) and that the control surfaces move in the direction we expect them to as we manipulate the controls (correct).

"Scud Running" is something no commercial flight has ever done (at least not in the last 60 years). Airlines are governed by a set of rules that would never allow them to do this, and there's really no need to since both the pilots and the airplane's technology already allow the planes to land in either zero-visibility or near-zero-visibility. Private pilots sometimes "scud run" because they are not authorized to fly into clouds or visibility less than 3 statue miles unless they have additional certification to do so, so they are trying to fly below a low layer of clouds in visual conditions but the clouds get lower and lower, or the terrain gets higher and higher, or the weather deteriorates.

The reason airliners are usually less susceptible to engine failures is that 1) they use turbine engines, which are much less prone to failure than piston engines, and 2) they have multiple engines, and their engines are powerful enough that they can continue flight on the remaining engines while they find a place to land ASAP.

"Pitot" is a French word. You don't pronounce the last "t". It's pronounced "pee-toe," not "pee-tote."

Not knowing the speed of your airplane is not as dangerous as you might think. There are procedures that the Air France pilots could have used. They could have dialed in a specific trim and power setting, and that would have kept the airplane within a safe speed range without them actually being able to see what their speed was. The Air France pilots did a LOT of things wrong, and that accident cannot be entirely blamed on the pitot tubes freezing over. You have to know a bit about the Airbus' computer and control systems to understand the complexities of that situation, and then understand how the pilots broke SEVERAL of their operating rules during the emergency. Other pilots have been put into a simulator that had the exact same scenario, and they were able to successfully save the aircraft. The aircraft also has "ground speed" which is derived from GPS position data, and the pilots can do some math to calculate approximately what their "indicated" airspeed is. (There are 4 types of speeds in flying: indicated, calibrated, true, and ground. And they all have their own separate purpose, and the speeds can vary drastically at any one point in time. You can have an indicated airspeed of 200 knots with a true airspeed of 300 knots and a ground speed of 400 knots, all at the same moment).


An "underspeed" condition isn't dangerous if you have sufficient altitude, because "underspeeding" the airplane will result in an aerodynamic stall and a small loss of altitude if the pilot applies the correct inputs but it won't result in a structural break-up of the aircraft. "Overspeeding" could lead to structural break up, but the very first indications of an overspeed are not usually cause for concern of the structural integrity of the aircraft. It's usually just a warning to the pilot to "hey! slow down!" It's not that the plane will break up right once you overspeed it. Usually the "Do not exceed speed" in many airplanes is simply 90% of the aircraft's "wing flutter speed", and if you have the wings rapidly fluttering for too long it can stress the aircraft structure.
A question I have is: "Should We Trust Refurbished Products?"
Funny that this video is uploaded right after the recent crash of an Ethiopian plane that occurred because of neglected malfunctions spotted the previous day
boarding a flight in 30 mins lol rip
Fire, Two Planes hitting each other, Problems with the Plane (or how it is built), all of this often because of human failure
- Black boxes are indestructible

naaah
he was an attack helicopter
Im actually studying aircraft accident investigations. I want to inestigate for the NTSB one day.

My cousin was one of the victims of Lion Air Plane crash back on 29th october 2018
May she rests in peace among other passagers
Ohh man my father is now on flight....now i am worried.. :( :(
Lmao “pi tote tube”
thanks for the sign, canceling my flight to london tomorrow !!! jk i’m not worried BUT wow great timing 😂😂
Why now... I have a flight in 2 days
Planes should be made of the same materials as that of the black box.....problem solved.....😛😛
For everyone worried about the 737, i am a mechanic on the 737 and we have very strict process checks and other means to check quality such as function test
Oh. My. God.
How can a person’s voice be so satisfying to listen to??

I thought 83% of the crashes were due to malfunctioning of the left phalangee
I’m waiting for my flight and this video came up. Might not go now
0:05 "altitude fucktuations"
I fly on Tuesday and was nervous about watching this video but I
now feel better!
Flying is very safe. I would recommend it. I love flying from perch to perch. :D
WHELP

im dead! im going on holiday in december.....great....
Next time on ASAP science: Why cars sometimes break down
Q:"WHY DO PLANES SOMETIMES CRASH ???"
A: BECAUSE THEY HIT THE GROUND !!!
              "NUFF SAID"
Why am I watching this 1week before going on a plane
Love u 2 u inspire science ❤️
Because of the freaking pilots
You hardly mentioned the 737 at all?!?!?
This is probably the most uncommon logic video I've seen.
You're more likely to die from a plane crash because it got struck with lightning than winning The Powerball.
Watching this at my gate
Fantastic video to watch two days before my 13 hour flight.O-o

That said, Lack of sleep is also linked to errors doctors make...when I think of those training to be a doctor with their inexperience combined with no sleep, I shutter. Can you all do a video on that?
Me: I’m not gonna wach this your flying soon and you hate flying 

My brain: watch it it looks fine 

Me:fine 

Me:NUUUUUUUUUU
The 737 Max 8 debacle is proof that Emulation isnt always a 100% fix.
Yo this is giving me flight anxiety
1182 commercial flight accidents still seem like a huge number in the timeframe of 8 years..given that we barely hear about plane crashes. Are these accidents also ones which landed safely but had some disturbances?
Collab with asap rocky when?
People need to protected like the black Blox.
I have this problem where I have anxiety just because I think about a plane and I don’t know what to do 
Any suggestions ?
Wow, it sounds tough to be a pilot 😕God bless them always.
I’m legally required to say “I’m not a bot” ~ bot #2386
because it be that way sometimes
it just do
This video just scares me from riding on planes
airplanes should be 100% controlled by AI .... its diffrent than cars you don't have over 200 people travelling 36,000feet in the air ... human error is bound to happen always
Sabotage highest in china. That doesnt surprise me after reading recently about people chucking coins into the engines for “good luck”
The way the title's written sounds like the odds1out saying yEaH tHeY dO tHaT
Brilliant video to watch 1 week before my flight to America
Just abt 2 wks ago, just before i go fly for a week-long holiday (11 hrs journey, mind you!! But no transit), this video was posted, and i DID NOT even want to watch it!😌and when at the end greg said abt their next vid abt what happens if your plane doors were open in midair, i cannot imagine the sit bcuz during my flight at night, the air temp showed on the screen was like -52 deg cels... naww....😅🙅
I should definitely watch this right before my flight to Texas 👍🏻
I'm flying from Montana to Florida on Saturday.  I'm so glad this title came up in my sub feed :P
5:01 LMAO I LUV THEM THEY'RE THE BEST COUPLE
You're more likely to win the lottery than die in a plane crash

let that sink in for a minute
To survive a plane crash 




#1 TIP - ALWAYS carry your own parachute
You know it's serious, when ASAPScience makes a video about it!
Ironic to think that the cheaper you are flying the more likely you are to survive.
I should have not watched this 2 weeks before my flight LOL
I dreamed about the 747's crash , one week before it happened.
But the front seats cost the most if ur going on budget flights. Time and ease beats an increased chance of survival. Makes sense.
#1 reason why planes crash...






Human Error
"why do planes crash?" because something went wrong in the aircraft or the navigation system, thats a really obvious question...
bro i was on a plane when this video dropped 😅
I love your videos !! Could you do one on paleontology please???
i would like to suggest you to do a video about panic attact and anxiety.Want to see a scientific aspect
I always travel in December and January.....
Ah yes. The data shows it to be practically super safe but my brain will still cause me fear as I'll be on a plane in May.
Sooooooo maybe I should not fly first class? Lol
All plane adjust altitude and/or heading to avoid certain clouds ALL!
Great, I'm flying to South Africa this December/Start of January 😂✈️
Just build it with obsidian
Human errors can also be caused by management pressure. I'm surprised airlines are not part of the reasons lol. Even mechanical errors are faults of airlines. Some airlines want cost effective ways in place of safety which therefore influences the pilot's mindset. The 1977 collision was also caused by miscommunication between the pilot and airtraffic control not just because of the thick fog. Watch air crash investigations for a more detailed explanation ont he examples they use.
im watching this the day before im going on a flight, so good luck to me 😑
3:46 jump before the plane hits the ground
Yes perfect timing! A week before my trip and my first plane ride.
i don't think the Air France can be considered as mechanical error,  yes  the tubes were frozen, but pilots are trained to work around this, then end result was pilot error not mechanical.
Hi asapscience can you do a video on dyslexia ？
Pilots:


Boeing:WERE ABOUT TO STALL NOSE DOWN NOES DOWN!!!


Pilots:Chill fam, it's cool


Boeing:IM PUTTING THE NOSE DOWN!


Pilots:NO DONT! pulls back yoke


Boeing:NO, IM FLYING


Pilots:NO, IM FLYING!


Boeing:NO, I OUT RANK YOU!


Pilots:YOURE GONNA GET US KILLED


Boeing:IM TRYING TO SAVE YOU!


Pilots:AHHHHHG...TELL MY WIFE I LO-


crash


Boeing:Woops, guess I was wrong...what a silly goose I am hey guys? :D


Pilots:


Boeing:...Guys?...GUYS?!...








...Not again.
Great,This video get upload just before my flight
How do black boxes survive crash?
My flight instructor always told me "Do a barrel roll" when I was having some trouble.
He said fucktuations instead of fluctuations.
Planes crash when Thanos snaps his fingers, that's another power of his
I'm going on a plane in like 5 hours, thanks
Wait.. people fly into mountains?.. airplanes go to fast they fall apart?
Note to self...🤔
Bus it😶
Still the safest way to travel
DUDE I WENT ON A BOEING 737 X MAX ON ICELAND AIR THE DAY BEFORE IT GOT BANNED PHEW
Without looking at screen, I thought this is the Wendover Production guy.
Yay!
Asap science video!
Time to get more knowledge to flex with!
Or get better as a human being but that's just a plus...
Because of FODs and Dirty Dozens
I’m on a plane
I can’t complain
Someone explain 
What is happenin?
I would argue that walking is the safest means of transportation.
Can the future video be WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A LEFT HANDED PERSON IS CHANGED OR CORRECTED TO A RIGHT HANDED..
Can you guys please write a textbook on general science??? I've always struggled with science, but watching your videos makes me understand it more. It must be the way you guys describe it all and have the drawings. You're the best science teachers I've ever had! Also I'm going to be a teacher for young kids, so I'll have to teach them basic science and if you guys had a textbook, I would most definitely make that be the book we use.
ASAPscience question: Are Extraterrestrial Life Real? How is it proven?
planes why sometimes crash 5/5 egnlish
Can you make a video on "why people hate studying"?
A plane crashed into my neighborhood on feb 3:(
Some people don't know that modern airliners have really sophisticated technology, and on top of that they have multiple computers all running the calculations at the same time to double check each other, the parts for these computers are also only ever produced at the same time (parts from different years won't be used in the same system), meaning the quality of material won't cause much variance in calculations. The newest Boeing engine has enough power to land the plane if all the other engines fail. It's truly amazing the engineering that goes into airplanes and making them safe.
Here’s the deal...




NEVER FLY AND WE WILL BE OK
2:08 suggests that duty time is a dependant variable, the value of y is dependent on x.
Still a "I don't think so, Cheif" You aint getting me on no plane. I'll Walk
You guys should do a video on bipolar disorder. Love your videos
Duh because if people were meant to fly we would have wings
Thanks for making us more afraid of flying
Probably why I haven't flew to Cali yet...too far and long flight
you still wont catch me dead on a plane tho
Just tell the plane it's not allowed to crash.
Sabotage is a beautiful word, am I right?
The question in my mind while watching this whole video was why do two planes sometimes crash
I have a question what existed before the very first thing to make everything
I'll just stay home
Because people rely on "trustworthy" machines.
Fun Fact: Not even a single plane crash has been reported by Fly Emirates, UAE and they hold the world record for their service!
There's nothing you as a passenger can do about it.
But, if you are the Pilot, you could do something
Thank you for addressing this :)
Which one of these applies to Joseph Joestar?
I am currently in the Seattle airport about ready to board my plain... nice
When your flying in January and now your gonna have a panic attack if it’s raining 😦

Question: Why planes sometimes crash? 
Answer: Because they're made be humans.
I just saved you 5 minutes of your life. You're welcome.
They have a 57 minute CRASH course
This is why cars are not living. Next vid?
Rest in peace to everyone on that Ethiopian 737 Max crash
Those Who says car driving is dangerous than airplane...let me ask you one question...
I have seen people surviving car accidents, have you seen people surviving air crash???
of course the back of the plane would be safest, have you ever heard of a plane reversing into a mountain??
Better question: What happened to Big Chungus?
better question is why can't I be on one of those planes when I'm traveling
Again this false statistic with airplanes being the safest method to travel.
Trains are the safest method. Airplanes are if you look at passengers * distance. As planes are fast, that skewes the statistics, but all that says is that you covered a greater distance until you die. Trains lead the stats if you look at passengers * travel time. As trains are slower, this skewes the stats towards a longer travel time. But this means that you actually lived longer until you die.


Another comparison: what's safer: traveling at 900 kph, 12,000 meters high ... or with 200 kph at ground level. How often have you heard of train crashes were all perished? It's a given in a plane, but unheard of in a train.
cause it fell from the sky duh
Isn't also the case that the majority of plane crashes are non-fatal? So even if you do find yourself in that rare position of being in a plane crash, you have a fairly good chance of surviving.
Tell that to Oceanic 815
I’m going on an airplane tomorrow! This is a great video to watch before hand
Why does youtube recomend this few hours before my flight??? 😢 I'll be flying to china as well next week. Now i am anxious
I find the drawings of people suffering, distasteful here.  Anyone else?
Better question: Why DON’T planes crash?
1 in 16 million is 1 too many!💯
Yay I have to go across the country tomorrow
Because the pilot thought he was playing GTA 5.
Right after my first flight😂
Can you do a "What goes first: Cereal or milk?" video? Please settle this debate with science!!
Probably not a good idea watching this since im traveling tomorrow
Are you just trying to make me feel better about the fact that I will never be able to afford 1st class?
Can you do this same video concept but with cruise liners?.. I want to go on a cruise but my friend is scared
When Mitch talks💘
Because gravity....... duh
because of gravity duhhh
I literally just got off a plane
The best safe time to fly is right after an accident
well shit ,My family booked a flight to china next week
I watched this at the airport... lovely
Pilot:"Todays gonna be a nice calm flight"
Boeing automation:"lmao no fam"
What about how the deja vu trash cans work?
How the hell you create a box that is explosive proof. wtf lmao
Because of snakes
Explain the science of the game telephone
The wing was drawn backwards in the thumbnail
COME ON IM LITERALLY GOING ON ONE TOMORROW
Because Sully wasn't flying em haha... Oh this is serious
69 percent survival
Planes crash because of that pesky thing called "Gravity".
"Sometimes" is an over exaggeration
Cool, I have a flight tomorrow. Guess I know what I'll be watching without headphones to pass the time!
You forgot "Bermuda Triangle c
wow, I've a flight tomorrow morning "I'm a superstitious"
Hi AsapSCIENCE! Could you guys do another parody video? Love your singing! Really helps in learning/remembering science stuff!
Who else has a flight in an hour?
This seriously spooks me. Some speeky deeky stuff... I don't wanna die!!!
Veteranklan
I wouldn’t fly or take a boat  I’d stay where i am 💯
Lmao I watched this video to reassure myself I wouldn’t die on my flight to China next week
And then you said the highest sabotage rate is in China. Great. :))
Sometimes planes crash because the plane is over capacity or the pilot is on cocaine/under the influence of other substances which is how Aaliyah died.
Never thought I'd be this early
Because they remembered how gravity works
This is my biggest fear ☹️
I still rather get pick up by a stranger on the side of a road.
I learned about old airplanes and how frequently they crash it has been called “Flying coffins”

sry for my bad english
69% ... Imagine this video was all for this lame joke...
RIP to the recent victims of Ethiopian airways crush.
Planed a trip to Korea and Japan from USA in January.... maybe I should reconsider the date
Hm hm. Great timing
Was just on a plane
Wow and i just bought tickets to flight lol
I’m about to go on a plane back home...
This didn't help my anxiety and my fear to flight at all
You have a higher chance of crashing/dying in a car crash than a plane crashing/dying in the plane.
Who's gonna buy the new one's?? 😥🤨😛
Stay happy and blessed everyone ! 🖤🙏
You two look so happy together
im flying in a month and now im actually scared..
EARLY!!!
I'm going on 4 flights the next 2 days
Next time on Air Crash Investigations....
1 view lol
Why do cars crash?
Why do boats sink?
The vibe the thumbnail gives is like "it's OK if it crashes, they gotta crash sooner or later right?" But video says more: SIKE it never really does"
it be like that sometimes ..
Can you make a videos of ways to feel less anxiety on flights
Imagine watching this during take off and causing the plane to crash
Read the title and said to myself ummm because of gravity.... duh.
Wendover Productions thinks this is Half as Interesting
then why don’t pilots sit at the back
You could say this is sort of a crash course
You should make a video on why sometimes people die.
I'll watch this video on an airplane, lol.
It is always terrible when the plane crashes.
I'm still scared to fly on a plane
Awesome and informative video
As a pilot, there are some true statements made in this video. However, I don’t think that this video accurately contextualizes plane crashes. One of the biggest things that I’ve  learned as a pilot (and from being highly involved in aviation) is that most plane crashes occur due to a series or chain of unfortunate events. It is highly unlikely (in most accidents) that one event will cause a plane crash.  Also, the video does not mention the industry-wide changes that are put into place after accidents to prevent such events from happening again. It is those changes that make commercial airline travel so safe today. Lastly, for those that have been concerned about their safety while flying, for almost every aircraft system, there are often multiple backups. For example, the video mentions that frozen pitot tubes affected airspeed indicators and caused a crash. To resolve this issue, pilots can recognize icing conditions and use pitot heat, which will melt the ice and restore normal pitot function. There are also multiple pitot tubes on many aircraft (especially commercial). As I mentioned before, accidents are caused by a chain of dangerous events. Poor decision making from the pilot (such as not recognizing icing conditions and not turning on pitot heat) can make the difference between life and death. This is not emphasized enough in the video. I have never posted a negative comment to bash a channel, so I hope that AsapSCIENCE takes this as constructive criticism to be more careful about disseminating information, especially when it can perpetuate fear amongst the audience. Please reach out to experts on topics like this, instead of regurgitating information that you might find in a Google search and pretending to be experts in a field in which you are not comfortable. Honesty is #1 these days :)
I was on a plane 2 weeks ago and it’s was a boeing 737 😅 it was such a shaky ride, Never again !
My uncle's going on that same plane to Hawaii soon 😬
2nd FeelsBadMan
Why do youtubers sometimes miss an upload
4:04 Hmm, but would you really want to survive a serious plane crash?  Living the rest of your life with (possibly) large burns, being paralyzed, PTSD, lung problems from the smoke, etc?
You should do an episode on why we hate the word moist
Someone tired to say the bigger the plane the more autisum ummmm THATS how it work
You guys should debunk products that promise impossible effects like telomerase supplements that advertise they can rejuvenate people at a molecular level 👌🏽
final destination be like
Because people shout ALLAHU ACKBAR




just a joke
Flight Attendant here, this was a fantastic video. Another fun fact but the middle seat is actually the safest seat to sit in as well!
0:24 what shocked me the most at that part wasn't the small number of accidents.

It was the number of flights. 16 MILLION?! shit, that's A LOT of pollution.
Because they tried to do 9/11's but failed
Going on three planes next month..please pray for me
ASAPScience, can you pin this. PLEASE READ: The 1977 runway collision at  Tenerife was not due to fog alone. There were multiple failures between both pilots and the air traffic controller. Yes, if it wasn't foggy they would've seen each other on the runway. At one crucial moment, the pilots cancelled each other out on the radio when talking to the air traffic controller. The Pan Am pilot didn't turn off the runway when it was supposed to and the KLM pilot took off without proper clearance. The 2009 crash, Air France Flight 447, was due to pilot error and not because of frozen pitot tubes. the pitot tubes did freeze but tests show that the pilots only had to fly for a couple of minutes for them to clear. The pilots displayed poor crew resource management. The pilot and co-pilot didn't communicate with each other, didnt say who was suppose to do what during the stall. They never recovered from the stall and crashed into the Atlantic ocean.
The good side of being broke, sitting in the back of the plane
Gravity my friends...Gravity!
Ali A just kissed you

\/ to undo
yes this is an omen.
3:12 if you know Spanish, you laughed
Maybe don't allow self safety certification for planes (or anything).
This is why I will never fly on a private plane
Because there's no children on board
next thing you know, space travel is going to be even safer
It's not just the pre-flight checklists; there are checklists for every stage of flight.
I think a lot of the fear with flying comes from our lack of control of the situation. Most people can understand that they are safer on a commercial airliner than they are driving themselves to work, but at least you are in control of that car, you can react to a danger and have a chance of saving yourself. Also, hurtling towards the ground at 200 meters a second, locked inside a burning tin can that you have no control of is just a nightmarish thought. I love planes, aviation, the history, the technology, I would love to try flying one day, but the thought of being in an airline accident makes my skin crawl.
Lies the safest way of travel is teleportation. Duhhh!
Look on the brighter side. If the plane ever crashes you die and thats a bonus. So really plane travel is great!
I have a 14 hour flight from San Francisco to Shanghai in a week and I feel like I'm gonna crash and die lol
Ha, this is why I don't leave my house.
Gotta love seeing this right before i get on a plane 😂😭
0:38 where is the rudder lol😂😂😂
Getting on a flight tomorrow. This was a good idea.
Bad drivers
So that Air France flight with the A330 with the frozen tubes was kind of actually human error because the pilot raised the nose so high the plane stalled and crashed into the ocean falling at 13,000 feet per second
If I ever get invited onto a private plane, I'm turning that offer down now.
Now theres one question in my mind. Why do we use airplanes? We have good travelling tactics on water or land
Stop calling the FDR and CVR a black box.  There are multiple black electronic boxes in aircraft.  None of those are the Flight Data Recorder, nor the Cockpit Voice Recorder... these components are orange or bright yellow (they were yellow at one point, I haven’t seen/installed a yellow one in years).
B E  CA  U S  E
I have a question 
What will smoking do to a child’s health?
Hey what would happen if a bird flew into the engine?
Lmao my flight leaves tomorrow...
1182 is still a lot.
So what I'm hearing is that we should get rid of pilots and automate everything more than it already is.
You play with physics and wonder why planes crash?
2:34 or just don't fly during thick fog
Because of George W bush
I like how this is on my recommend and im going on a plane later today
Wow. The irony. You’re more likely to die if you’re First Class.
I flew today😂
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
"Well, isn't this nice."
- Alanis Morrisette
Watching this during my flight
Bus in fortnite never did crash!
I know it’s you orange panda
Sabotage highest in China? Wow the Chinese Gov covers very well
Dwight Schrute would know the safest seat on a plane. Amirite?
You think I'm gonna sit in the back of the plane where its safer and wait an extra 20 minutes to get off?  HA!
Looking forward to my flight tomorrow
Airplane doors don't open at cruising altitude. Pressurized aircraft don't allow this to happen. So, if your plane's door opens, there's already been a problem, as the cabin has been depressurized.
Plane crash corner 😂
Why did I imagine Randy Orton?
Because Bush wanted it two
It's pito. The second t is silent
Pilot go sleepy sleep duh
... I'm getting on a plane in 2 hours
ill never set foot on a plane
nice im watching this while im boarding
An old pilot is a good pilot.
Because cooperate greed and corner cutting.
Those 2 Boeing 737 max don't fit any of these categories. With everything out so far it seems like a software error that could have been avoided with purchasable safety options. Computer malfunction or corporate greed, take your pick.
Back to the back I go!!!
“ Another study feEaUnd..” geez where is this guy’s accent from
I think it's interesting that front to mid seats are the least safe yet most LCC would charge these seats the highest.
Once you are in the sky there is a small chance that you will survive.
I have a flight tomorrow,jerk😂
Watching this on a plane.
Great vid guys
I mean I've always been scared of flying but now.....
So what you're saying is replace everybody with AI
Easy, because they fall.
Sunday, when I had a four-hour flight, the power on the plane went out a few times during boarding and going to the runway. Before we took off, the power went off for the fourth or fifth time. The pilot came over the intercom thing and told us that there was an issue with the battery or energy thing that powers the engine. We had to go back to the gate to get the thing started back up and to get a backup generator in case it went out while we were in the air.


Basically, we jumped off the plane's dying engine battery and grabbed a portable battery in case it went out while we were 10,000ft in the air. That was a great four hours.
This video is incorrect.  Sumbirenes are the safest way to travel because there are more planes in the air than sumberienes in the sky.
Watching Oman airplane
Probably some Chinese dude throwing coins in the engine again unless it's United Airlines. In that case, it's just the company throwing coins again to increase profit.
New planes now upload black box data remotely to the cloud
Great content as usual
Better take fortnite bus I think
Maybe because your country bombs one, and gets away with the blackbox.
You're more likely to be in 3 school shootings and survive all of them than you are to be in a plane crash. Thanks MinuteEarth! I feel safer flying already! 😄
level 1 crook planes
Because a Toyota Corolla hit them mid air
Your videos are amazing!!!!
Planes sometimes crash because they sometimes hit things for example: the ground, the ocean, mountains, big bird, etc.
Oh and they sometimes crash because pilots flying them are grossly undertrained in flying said plane. I'd rather walk or just not go than to fly a non-U.S. carrier.
im flying this week... :(
Why do planes sometimes disappear?
As soon as I get off of my flight
Because they’re Ryanair flights
how long do these videos take to make?
So eliminating human factor makes flying safer . Fully autopilot planes solves the problem
9/11 jokes are plane wrong
Love this video!!!!!
3:44 China go home you're drunk!
No black box on 911 tho oof
I have a flight on Tuesday
ah yes, a plane crash video a day before my long overseas flight. Now if I die, I will at least know the science behind it.
Oh great, I fly out every January. Good to know I’m more likely to die.
2:28 however due to human error
And that’s why I’ll never get on a plane
0:57, hold up, 1182 commercial flight accidents in the last 8 years? Why do we only hear about a couple per year yhen??
I’m going on a flight in two days
Private planes just make me think of greys anatomy.
So business class flyers will be the first to die, Ironic
Because they are made by humans!
I am not to hijack this plane, I am trying to save it!
1:42 you misspelled pilot. Human error indeed.
How do planes compare to trains in terms of safety?
Wow, I knew one of those people on the Ethiopian crash...
Elevators are the safest means of travel..
Flying is safer than driving
69% safety rate in the back of the plane
They crash because it was set up to crash.  No science needed
Cause it just does that sometimes
I STILL CANT UNDERSTAND HOW PLANES FLY
Look i'm not a pilot but if we have a route with fluctuating altitudes, why don't you just fly +200 meters from the mountains peak from the beginning of the flight?
Of course none of these statistics mater because the true problem with the recent crashes wasn't probability. It was a change in regulation standards. These panes were doomed to crash the minute the were made and approved.
Wait what is the safest seat?!
Sometimes...
First comment
I'm at the airport waiting for the gate to open.. and this video comes up on my suggestions. Thanks youtube.
3:20 what's up with that gear placement?
Who is here after Boeing 737 crash 😂
I don't know if I should be more scared or less scared of planes after watching this
If its Boeing I'm not going
Great video! I’m curious about why the incidence of flight sabotage is highest in China. Can you share any more details about that data?
Sitting at the back of a plane is the only 69 I’ll ever get in my life
Why do cars sometimes break down, some thing
I’m not gonna lie but when the two planes ran into each other I giggled
Hey how's it going
never flies again
Airbus is a single word
Planes make clouds and every time someone pees on a plane that's what rain is. Prove it wrong Science. Please. Try.
Sick this video just popped up after seeing Breaking Bad's chapter in which the airplane crash happens.
I was on one of the Max 8’s before they were grounded in the US and I was nervous af. The stewards gave away free drinks because people were so stressed.
plane: oh look a penny !
You know it's serious when stewardess started to panic. We had a strong turbulence when passing Japan! I just looked at the stewardess but they seem so calm.
Who what a got time to watch this video when you have a flight next week😁
I love you!
I think the thing about planes is yes they’re safer but you’re more likely not to survive after a plane crash than in a car. so that’s why more people are scared of them because the likelihood of you living after a plane crash is lower than a car crash.
Why isn't the other guy narrating any more? Also why is radio gaga playing in the background?
I'm terrified of flying.. I'm not sure why I chose to watch this
can’t wait for my flight tomorrow!
"get-home-itis"
69 hehe
1:35 "Pitot" it's actually Pilot
3:46 apparently that’s not China
You're most likely to survive a car crash than a plane crash.
cuz They use windows 98
Im flying in 2 days...
Birds and ice right ?
Highest in China???
because  Aliens.
2nd.
The cause of the Air France wasn’t just the pitot tube. It goes a lot farther than that. Foreign pilots are not trained near as well as pilots in the US. Both crashes were basically the pilots failure to just fly the airplane.
I hate that guy with glasses.
49% chance of survival in 1st Class compared to 69% in the back of the plane? Worth it.
Actually the safest mode of transportation is the elevator.  When was the last time you heard of someone being injured on an elevator?
We need to upgrade planes
Safest for everyone except the planet Earth.
RIP Aaliyah
I regret watching this video
Boeing has left the chat
Did Boeing pay you to make this video?
Next topic why do we die
Yes, maybe the safest, but also the most environmentally unfriendly way of travel... please stop promoting air travel and it´s safety without mentioning how unsafe it is for the future generations that are going to try to live on this polluted earth. Spread awareness!!!
2:25 oh no!
Are you more attracted to people with the same eye and hair color?
the thumbnail reminds me of final destination 5
Please let the other guy narrate the videos, he’s a natural.
We have a flight soon and this was on my recommended. Are you happy now youtube?
4:01 yes!
Or because the pool or is suicidal
I shouldn't be watching this,I'm going on a plane for the first time in 6 months 0_o
But . Sometimes people survive after a car crash . Have you ever heard about someone who didn't die after an aircraft accident
4:02  69...... ayyyeeeee
mitch was so cute
Yike
Air France was human error cos the second officer was pulling back on the stick like a dumbass instead of just doing nothing, as well as the captain not flying during the most treacherous part of the flight.
Because shit happens. There saved you 5 minutes
I have a question
It's illegal to bring a parachute on a commercial travel?
Peace
Yes but it's not safe for your wallet.
First
2nd!
?? How is fluing dafe if there were 1.2k planes in 8 years wtf
MAYDAY
So maybe I shouldn’t have watched this on the plane?
Why am I watching this in the airport
sometimes
Pitot tubes measure air pressure
KRATOM!
bruh i gotta flight tomorrow
Crashes  in cars are mostly not fatal.
Guys what means hangover ?
First!?
cause shit sometimes happens.
Good I have a flight tomorrow
What about erm a plane in Malaysia or in another country went missing was it sabotage Or something Because it just went Missing Like literally Missing.
Aren't trains safer than planes?
😱😱😞
Never fly in the plane whose pilot is Muslim. Issued In public interest
So much analysis and statistics.. Yet this video ignored the most important statistic... Which aircraft maker had the highest number of crashes.
Tesla plane
3:33 human error caused the crash
of course I’m still watching this when i have two flights coming up:)::):))))
I am literally in an airport rn help me
Going on a flight in October with school . I’m not exited
Not the thing o want to see while I’m in an airport😑
Stop using the word "accident" for human error and sabotage.
Trains are safer
Air travel is NOT safer than other methods of travel.
For one thing, there is no fender-bender accident up there. 
Second, when they do crash, 100s die. Not just one or two as in a typical fatal car crash. 
As a private pilot, I fully appreciate the training I had to get my license. 
If only car drivers had to go through the same training, I doubt there would be any car accidents, besides mechanical failures or acts of God.
Well it's kinda logic that if you sit in the back of the plane, your chances of surviving a crash is higher. The back of the plane is always the last part crashing, because, well, it's on the back. So, the front part will always absorb some of the choc before the back receive it.
Gravity?
Why planes sometimes crash?
I still hate flying.
2:42 those airplanes look like lizards 🦎
My farts kill the pilots causing them to crash the plane. Sorry about that. I'll try not to be so deadly in the future.
1:31 Nice Pitot aka pilot
If it aint boeing i aint going
4:04 % of survival?? aren‘t flight accidents pretty much like... total crashes? Like in which scenarios do 69% of people survive which accidents?
The scariest is spatial disorientation
Gravity duh
Commercial jets scud running. Lol.
Do we know why the back is safer?
Because Russians sometimes like to shoot them down.
Why don't we just pass a law banning plane crashes?
0:50 An accident is something that cannot be avoided or foreseen.  Those are not accidents.  Those are crashes.
3:44 is it just me or does China look like it's missing a section?
100% of people that have been on a plane will die #Fact
1:40 pitot
Crazy idea why isn’t the plane made of the same stuff as the black box I mean that thing can survive anything
Question. Did this conclusion take into account that less people fly than ride car or something? IDK if this matter but I'm curious. My thinking was, since there are more cars and people that ride them, therefor there's a higher chance an accident happen there.
Gravity
how nice, i will have a flight in a week and this video shows up on my recommended videos :)
Amazing
There have been no cases where weather was an explicit cause of accident. Pilots fly in fog all the time, and it was due to human error in the control tower that the planes crashed
My father worked in aviation and said that both of those planes didn’t have to crash the pilots just weren’t experienced enough to handle the situation. There is definitely a problem with the planes and they should be grounded but that’s why some companies didn’t want to ground the plane because they felt their pilots could handle a situation like that if it occurred. I just know I don’t mess with planes. PERIODT.
I know statistically speaking you're less likely to die from flying than driving, but what's the statistic of surviving a crash/malfunction from a plane and a car?
Early
why am I watching this when I have a flight in 3 hours
that other guys voice is sooo much better.
heyyyy...i love you guys.......
I’m watching this on a plane rn 👍
OMG 69%!
Very good cli, any comment that I thought about was either addressed or out of the scope of a 5 minute video.

Sometimes?

4:05 nice
That’s so cool
Why not just add parachutes for all seats ? Therefore they can jump out and survive the crash .

that hairy hand thoo
RIP Emiliano Sala
If everyone brings a parachute then no death.
Why do we breathe?
Why do ships sometimes sink why do cars sometimes crash why does humans sometimes die why does some planets get eaten up by supergiant black holes?
I have really bad anxiety and I’m going on an 8 hour flight in a few months. I’m even more terrified now🙃
So many idiots in the comments. People that don’t know it’s is really safe to fly. Of course it is
Its kinda hard to say the air france flight crash was caused by the frozen pitot tube, because frozen pitot tubes aren't too uncommon. What actually happened was the pilots panicked and tunnel visioned in response to the frozen pitot tube throwing off all sorts of alarms. Instead of flying at the same altitude, they kept getting higher and higher until the plane stalled, plummeting into the atlantic. So, its more like a pilot error which could've been prevented.
It's usually the lethality involved that steers me away from planes. Sure the chance of something going wrong are slim.....but if something does go wrong? It can get hairy quick.
Cuz the pilot might be a terrorist and decide to fly the plane into one of the twin towers
What actually happens when a commercial airplane goes through the clouds?
But whenever it crashes it kills hundreds of people though... I don't know what ratio is better. In car accidents, it probably kills maybe 4-5 people maximum and sometimes it's not even fatal. But a plan crash is most likely fatal and kills hundreds of people.
So, how would the Lion Air and Ethiopian Air crashes be classified? Human error?
Okay I hate flying now
Rich people sit.in front die first
The Air France one with the frozen tubes was a human error! Due to readings inconsistencies the autopilot disengaged, and the first officers pulled the nose up, and the plane stalled.
My dad crashed in a beach craft Banaza (private plane) the cable broke but luckily he lived.  If you don’t believe me look up Joel Fallon plane crash!
The ratio of 1:16,000,000 airplane crash is quite assuring...unless you're among in that 1 plane crash.
Lots of errrs
just teleport
3:59 nice
Pointless. We will replace all planes with rail anyways.
Hi
If accidents happen because of human error, why don't we use AI and similar tech to improve safety? (Probably a lot of things are already autonomous, but, couldn't it be improved?)
What about war? You didn’t mention things like the plane getting shot down, like with that one commercial plane that got shot down by Russian forces or something a few years back.
1st
What’s a commercial flight? At commercial of plans on TV? Is me right?
I was in a very minor commercial plane accidentally when I was a child. The plane drove off the runway during take off and part or the wing tip broke off. Nothing crazy but it was a minor story in the news papers (back before internet news).
Donald Trump says planes crash because they are too complicated.

Hello
9 11
Cause shit happens
If you don't trust commercial aviation, just be Superman and fly anywhere! So easy
9/11 was false flag inside job.
Noice
So many 9/11 jokes wow..
Plane crashes are extremely rare but the reason people are scared of flying them is because most are fatal. Car crashes are common but most aren’t scared to drive/be in them because most crashes aren’t fatal
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU!
Niceeee
Words you never want to hear:

Nice video.
ARMYYYY WHERE ARE YOU AT???
I’m terrified of flying lol
I can’t get on planes. I experienced horrible turbulence that left me scarred for life. I’m so upset I use to love traveling. Now I’m comfortable in the comfort of my own home haha. These recent accident just scared me even more ! Anytime I get on a plane I hyperventilate and sweat like I just worked out. It’s impossible for me to fly
Yikes
Still scared
Why does the thumbnail person sit facing the wrong direction?
Because of muslims
I’m meant to be flying tonight.... dear god why did I watch this ...

I've only been on a plane once. funny enough, it was 3 months before 9/11
Cuz they’re stupid, if I was a plane I’d never crash
I’m flying tomorrow. I have extreme flying anxiety. Why did I click this video? I don’t know...
a you do a video on if it’s normal for girls to like other girls?
I want to emphasize that CFIT or controlled flight into terrain is an issue that presided predominantly in private flying, not in commercial flights. The scud running issue is also a private pilot issue as without an instrument rated pilot nor an instrumented rated plane, flying into clouds is an extremely dangerous scenario. But in commercial aviation, these planes can fly in zero visibility and most approaches into big airports allow the plane to descend to clouds as low as 200ft. above the airport.
37th
I get this in my recommend when I’m planning to go to California is a few months. Now I feel like I need to cancel.
Ok 1 in 16 million. But would you rather be in a car crash or a plane crash? I reckon a car crash would be a lot less fatal considering the circumstances.
I’m less scared of being in a plane now :) never been in one, but now I’m more open to the idea.
The odds don’t help at all tho lmao I would rather die in a car accident than die falling 30,000 feet mid air

Great video guys!
बड़े बड़े शहरों में ऐसी छोटी मोटी बाते होती ही रहती है ।
a bit of an odd question...
there are more than 1000 reasons why a plane would crash, from a loose screw to structural dage to human error to a terrorist...
I found a guy who copied your video, it's called "SCIENZA subito", I think you have to take the situation seriously since the content is yours and he decided to steal it shamelessly, I signaled his channel, I'm on your side !
Hi I’m 29 years old woman and I never want to get pregnant or married and I’m living a single life and I am so happy I don’t have children on my own 😀

Bush did 9/11
People you know the odds of you dying in a car crash is 1 in 98 while the odds of you dying in a plane crash is 1 in 205,500 your anywhere so you so much more likely to die in a car crash than a plane crash so be afraid of cars not Planes
why is water wet?
Now Boeing is banned in most of the countries ....and also in India 
And this video mostly mentioned about the Boeing aeroplanes. ......which Is why I think banning this was worth🖖🖖👌🤘

Just turned YouTube off, reaslized that ASAP science had just uploaded so now I'm here
So you're paying more for higher risk of death when buying first class seats... noted

I know that this is extremely unlikely and unrealistic but I wonder what would happen if you fell out of the door mid flight and got sucked into a Boeing 747 jet engine at full trust? Would you crumpled the fan blades or would you get grated into a cloud of red gas?
4:08 I appreciate the use of "uncrewed" instead of "unmanned"! It's great to see more inclusive language becoming the norm.

Fun fact: A landing is a controlled crash.

hey guys maybe someone will see this, maybe they won’t, but even though i’ve been on countless flights i just get so scared and anxious about plane rides, even though i’ve seen all of these facts about air travel safety before. if anyone has any tips to help me get through an upcoming flight then that would be greatly appreciated
Just remember to never use electronic devices during takeoff or landing

also remember that flying is terrible for the environment so you really shouldn't do it at all

2:22 but I've flown on a plane in December before
Wow that fact that you just made this video made me unsubscribe, they built bad planes that simple
It is actually not correct that "human error" is the cause of accidents.  It is a skewed view due to hindsight bias.  Pilots are constantly having to accommodate and compensate for gaps in the design of systems, procedures and designs. Sometimes they are not able to, and when that happens the pilot is blamed.  By contrast, there is a false belief that computers are perfect, but in actual fact the computer is only reliable because we keep it in a protected bubble and adjust OUR behavior and the environment to keep the computer running.
meh
IM IN CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Flying is the safest mode of transportation" is a propaganda created by rich airline companies so people keep using their service
Your drawings are good but you might need to work a bit on making the plane drawings look a little more realistic
This video was brought to you by “BOEING”
Oops. I was going to make a science joke but Na.
what airplanes company does not say is that yes per km distances , air is the best BUT by time (hours for hours) on travel only ,you have 5 times more chances to die in airplane fatal accidents than in....cars !!!
Just want to wish you a good day
9/11 had two crashes, lol.

I Dont Care How Safe A Plane Is, IM NEVER GETTING ON A PLANE!!! Lol Never Have Never Will! But Im Glad I Watched This Video Because I Do Have A Better Understanding Of Planes. But Ill Still Never Get On One 🤷🏽‍♀️
It’s all because of the birds!! They’re trying to kill us all!!
It’s not the safest
Well in a car crash depending on severity you can walk away with minor injuries, but a plane crash and you're gone.
If we flew as much as we are in a car, then cars are safer
You can add another reason for plane crash - bigger profit margin
Birds wouldn't come near the planes if the planes had a gun.
Why dont they install parachutes big enough to slow a crashing plane's descent? I'm not sure if commercial planes are designed to glide but they should. If none of those work, how about releasing an instant kill gas for every passenger killing them before crashing. That'll make the experience less scary
Where are the black boxes from the aircraft hijacked on 9/11?
Actually elevators are the safest method of transportation
Safest...as long as you don't consider the climate change caused by the highest polluting form of travel.  Come on guys, I thought you would be able to see the bigger picture with stuff like this.
To be fair. How many planes are usually in the sky at any given time compared to how many vehicles are on the road at any given time?? I'm going to go out on a limb and say there are usually more vehicles on the street than planned in the air. Plus on the ground, you have to lookout for pedestrians, animals like possums, squirrels, dogs, cats, other drivers who aren't paying attention to the road, ECT. Plus in order to fly a plane, you have to go through extensive training. To drive a car, you have to have the bare minimum of hours completed (really easy task), and pass a test that's super easy. Plus with planes, I'm pretty sure you have to pass the test more than once. With driving, you only have to take the test 1 time in your entire life. So yeah, I wouldn't say the sky is safer.....I would just say after taking everything into consideration, there's just less chance of crashing. Doesn't really mean it's safer tho lol. If there were as many planes in the sky as cars on the street, I'm sure it'd be just as unsafe lol. Besides, who cares, because smoking and lung cancer is killing everyone, but we are worried about something as trivial as plane crashes!! Come on now people lol. Getting killed on a plane, is like getting killed on a roller coaster.....it doesn't happen a lot.....but it does happen. Just remember that next time you want to go on a roller coaster or plane....and if this comment ruins you're fun, oh well. We all gotta die someday, right? If it was meant to happen that way, then so be it. That's how I look at it. Why sit in the back seat for a "better chance" of living. You're on a plane!! If you're going to crash and die, then so be it, it was probably meant to happen. I'm not going to sit in the back just to "lessen" my chances of dying lol. If I wanted to "lessen" my chances, I just wouldn't fly at all lol, not sit in the back for a "better chance" of living. Lol.
While flying is very safe we need to stop due to the large effect it has on climate change while yes this mean going on holiday maybe be a bit more limited it’s a sacrifice we must make u till we have global electric transportation
So this means 1÷16 is 0.0625 so this means 625 people die every 1 plane crash
It's almost as if we allow companies to buy our politicians. 
Oh. We do.
This is why we need to have a separation of state and business. The conflict of interest is simply too great.
The climate is changing ..




Why aren’t we.
There’s this Search Engine called Ecosia. About half of the money they make from advertising goes directly to planting trees (the rest is used for operating costs and marketing) They already planted 52 million trees is places where deserts are expanding!

Like this so people use it!
anyone else getting depressed and scared thinking about the future of this planet?
Imagine, Exxon would have been way ahead of its time if it had published the paper and offered renewable energy.
I literally got an ad from Save Our Planet lmao
As a physicist, it's equally frustrating to know that the big oil companies have done everything to slander nuclear power, with political campaigns and funding for organizations like Greenpeace. If nuclear power would have continued to expand through the 80-ties until now we would be in a much better situation to deal with climate change.
60% OF THE WORDS WILDLIFE SINCE THE 1970'S OH MY GOD
AOC: "We only have 12 years left!"
Gore: " I've been saying that for 30 years!"
Exxon literally killed the planet for more money.
I have nothing to say
Please make a video on the effects of animal agriculture on the climate
It pisses me off to no end to hear old, selfish people destroying the planet for future generations in the name of profit because they know they will already be gone when the world ends. I'm only 16 and it breaks my heart because I don't want to die with most of my life having been spent in school. It makes it hard to keeo going. I fully support all the kids around the world who skip school to protest climate change inaction, especially when there is no point in getting an education if the world is predicted to die before you can make any use of it.

Exxon: Hires scientist

Exxon: 👉👂🤪👂👈 La la la can't hear you
As a hardcore conservative, I can say that I agree with most of the political views correspondent to right-wing political perspectives; however, it is more than clear that climate change and global warming are true, existing phenomenons that we definitely shouldn't ignore or, even worse, deny...

I think  should be concerned about this giant issue; not only young millenials, as this video seemingly tries to suggest (that's the only issue with the video)
The real climate change debate isn't if it exists but what we should do about it and how.
-companie hires scientists
-scientists ”We have found a very important that can save the world”
-companie ignoring scientists

Exxon: Hires scientist

Scientists: Will you listen to our research?

Exxon: "Well yes, but actually no"
Phil Jones, the beleaguered British climate scientist at the centre of the leaked emails controversy, is facing fresh claims that he sought to hide problems in key temperature data on which some of his work was based.
A Guardian investigation of thousands of emails and documents apparently hacked from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit has found evidence that a series of measurements from Chinese weather stations were seriously flawed and that documents relating to them could not be produced.
Jones and a collaborator have been accused by a climate change sceptic and researcher of scientific fraud for attempting to suppress data that could cast doubt on a key 1990 study on the effect of cities on warming – a hotly contested issue.
He keeps referring to statements like, "the debate about climate change" as though there are only two options: either you deny climate change (at that time only called global warming) or you believed climate change will be the doom of humanity. I feel like he's ignoring the actual scientific debate in favour of what he wants to believe. The actual debate is over significance - whether climate change is mild and manageable, or is an existential threat to humanity. Conceptualising why nobody wanted to put all their eggs in the climate change basket is understandable when end of the world claims are made about almost every human activity that improves human life and development. Even being fair to the actual denialist, the claims of climate alarmists were that by the 2000s the sea level would rise by 10-20ft. Comparing that to what we know now is plenty of reason to be skeptical. Even todays climate models have so much error built into the simulations that after 10 years you can't even accurately measure the effect of any changes made today. 


Watch this video by Bjorn Lomborg to get some perspective:
If you guys don’t know the difference between weather and climate, then please don’t comment on the video saying that climate change is a hoax.
Humans scare me. How can somebody live in good conscious knowing that they are lying to the public to gain more money and power
nexxon: exists

global warming: am i a joke to you?
Why it’s hot every year more and more!! Why weather it’s different more powerful storms every year!?
"Kolkata" frame in the background. I am curious to know. 😄
Can you make a video for climate change vs global warming
What's even worse than the lie is that we managed to turn an environmental issue into a political one..............
Fix your lisps before worry about global warming
Wrong, the first evidence for climate change was noted in the 50's at Universities.  But other than that you are giving a fairly accurate rendition of what the scientists in all the oil companies were coming up with the same scenarios. And like Exxon, they all lied, except for AMOCO, which ended up being taken over by BP.  Note: AMOCO had a long reputation for environmental responsibility, being the only oil company that refused to put lead in their gasoline, because of the obvious hazard and known fact that there was no safe level of lead in the system.
Technocracy Rising - Patrick M Wood
I know way late to this video and I'm not defending Exxon. I live about 15mins from the southern campus in Texas. I also drive for uber and Lyft. I've picked up a number of Exxon employees and was told by 2 of them that Exxon is now heavily investing in electric energy. Now rather they're going to figure out a way to use electric energy in the future or just know about it and deny it again. I don't know and we'll have to see.
Broke: World will end in 30 years because of Climate Change.

"Challenge the science" That makes less than zero sense
The first paper linking CO2 emissions and climate change was published in 1896
Yeah, fossil fuel is aweful - can I have the last 40 years of your life back please?
The perfect way to make sure nothing significant is ever done about an issue is to politicise it.
There is no debate in media. If real climate experts would appear in media the CO2-bubble would burst.
Global warming was discovered before 1900, not in the 1980's.
Thank you for this video! Amazing work!!
Imagine cigarette companies hiding the health effects on us. 


This is a criminal case. They intentionally conspired with politicians to hide effects to the planet to make billions of dollars in decades while other people paid with their health, farms, houses and lives. And will continue on for centuries.
What if more research was done into solar cells, if storing energy from them could be made much more efficient then they could potentially be a great solution right? I mean if solar panels were made affordable and there was an efficient way of storing the energy everybody could make there own power. I get it’s not as easy as just discovering a magical new way of storing energy for long periods of time but solar energy is probably the most personal sort of energy source you could have as I’m not sure everyone could have a wind turbine in there back garden!
Hey, I can see a framed map of Kolkata hanging on your back wall. Can I know why that is hanging there? Becoz I am from that city 😊
Meanwhile we still refuse to take advantage of Nuclear Energy because our uninformed populace is afraid of it despite it working wonders for France.
Again, another left leaning video that skips over many facts.  100 million trees died in California mostly to fire.  Then people will call the fires all due to Carbon emissions.  Except fire is important to the cycle of nature.   The green new deal and AOC is absolute insanity and her ignorance will have far worse implications for America and the world then just economic.  Countries like China, Russia, those bordering the Amazon and many other third world countries are far more important to focus on if we want to make real impact.  Instead of Carbon Taxes, tax incentives should be given to help accelerate new technologies for energy capture from the Sun that lasts far longer than it takes to pay for itself and doesn’t harm the environment once it’s use is no longer effective.
Thank you for this video!! I cannot wait for the next one!

Lol. Hottest days since 2000. But not the hottest before the year 2000. Nice way of misleading people to fear.lol
I am not surprised that an oil company covered up climate change...  makes sense, but unfortunate.
The Earth's climate and other mechanisms will increasingly be a topic of interest in the years to come as crops fail, regions scortch, populations migrate, economies strain and governments wobble. Yet this challenge holds the great opportunity for humanity to finally unite, out of necessity now. Read the free e-book The Great Waves of Change to find out what is coming over the horizon and how YOU can prepare. The doubters' voices will grow faint as the Great Waves strike humanity ever.
if i lived in the 80s, my science fair question would be “is global warming real?”
I agree with the overall point, but here's two quite elementary mistakes you made:

1) CO2 is not burned, it is the product of burning stuff. (4:30)
2) "this allows the carbon released to combine with the oxygen in the atmosphere." this is a very strange sentence. the carbon (C) is not "released" and  bound to oxygen (O). it's only one step called burning. the resulting gasous CO2 molecule is released into the atmosphere.
I think we knew that co2 absorbed infrared light from the 1890s...
The sun is the one that controls the temperature, when the sun is very active, the temperatures go up and when it slows it get colder. CO2 is not a major factor, as a mater of fact H2O vapor is a much more dangerous for the climate.

97% of Tigers gone since 1914.
90% of Lions gone since 1993.
90% of Sea Turtles gone since 1980.
90% of Monarch Butterflies gone since 1995.
90% of Big Ocean Fish gone since 1950.
80% of Antarctic Krill gone since 1975.
80% of Western Gorillas gone since 1955.
60% of Forest Elephants gone since 1970.
50% of Great Barrier Reef gone since 1985.
40% of Giraffes gone since 2000.
30% of Marine Birds gone since 1995.
70% of Marine Birds gone since 1950.
28% of Land Animals gone since 1970.
28% of All Marine Animals gone since 1970.
97% – Humans & Livestock are 97% of land-air vertebrate biomass.

10,000 years ago we were 0.03% of land-air vertebrate biomass.2030 = 40% more water needed.

2030 = 15% more emissions emitted.
2030 = 10% more energy needed.
2030 = 50% less emissions needed.
2018 = The world passes 100 million oil barrels/day for the first time.
2025 = In 7 years oil demand grows 7 million barrels/day.

50 years until all the soil is gone says Scientific American.

100% emissions reductions will take 70 years says Vaclav Smil.

There has never been a 100% energy transition, we still burn wood.

50% of Europe's renewable energy is from burning trees imported by ship worldwide.

No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy


We have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid 1.5 C.

We have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2.0 C.

Runaway Hothouse = 5 major tipping points triggered between 1.5 - 2.0 C.



Runaway Hothouse = unstoppable + irreversible.

Runaway Extinction = unstoppable + irreversible.

NOTHING WRONG HERE.
Americans
1988 : We can do it !
2019 : Produces 70% electricity from fossil fuels.
Oh George Bush cares about the climate....Im in!
I just wanted to thank you guys for this video, I'm working on an article about direct energy conversions and this info so well reunited and with all the bibliography so available is going to be very usefull for one part of my work. Keep doing what you do, this is great!
When you hire scientists and completely ignore your own scientists' findings
Scientists: "am I a joke to you?"
your mama's a climate change denialist.
I always clash with my dad about this... He's convinced that global warming is a government propaganda and I'm studying biology at University. I don't understand how people would rather believe things that have absolutely no foundation rather than results and models that have been proven again and again. Yes, there is always "uncertainty", but I think there is already too much "evidence" rampaging wildlife and it pisses me off so bad. -_-
Why is the map of kolkata in your background?! I'm from Kolkata btw and hence, curious!
If you want to do something constructive make a video about how well placed windows and skylights can provide free heat in in buildings in fall winter springs for free and that these same windows and skylights can be opened at night to cool buildings in spring summer and fall. BTW, your car only usually has a service life of 5000-10000 hours,  less than a year, (365 X 24 = 8760 hours) on average.
Time-traveling assassins from the future, take note.
Guys, thank you for this video, In the next one I would like to see about the alternative energy sources and some actual numbers, if possible, on the energy gain of each source in comparison to coal.
I recommend reading Naomi Oreskes & Erik M. Conway: "Merchants of Doubt":

The people sowing doubt and 'fake news' about
- acid rain
- ozone hole
- secondhand smoke
- global warming and
- DDT
are sometimes even the same people again, handed over to the next industry in intentional denial of the damage they cause or help to cause.

An extremely well researched, carefully sourced and (entirely too - lawyers!) politely formulated book. Reads like  written "Missions Impossible".

Thank you - as always - for a very engaging, passionate and nerdily researched video! (Long time viewer, but new to commenting.)
That's real knowledge! Thank you so much!
THERE IS NO PLANET B
This isn’t the first climate change to happen. A big cooldown is to be expected in 2020’s.
This is really just history repeating itself.

Cause, *gasp*, this exact scenario happened with the Tobacco Industry!
What about the scientist that warned about climate change in 1958?
Did not Al Gore refer it as "An Inconvenient Truth"?
Lets take Exxon Mobile to the human rights court in Strasbourg. For crimes against humanity. Their propaganda has put us back decades and along with the rest of the fossil fuel industry will kill more people and do more damage then the Second World War. The fact that they knowingly lied for short term profit is beyond cruel. The life one land and in the air and sea is suffering and taking the cost of this. They should be hold responsible for this. We are definitely fighting the dark side of humanity here.
Great let’s regressing to 1700 😄🤣
Wait wait wait. So since 1980 we KNEW climate change was happening But did nothing!!!!! Its now 2019 and we need to stop
In New Zealand at this very moment there are school students on strikes for climate change




lol thanks for the likes
Thank you my friend. New subscriber!
Please do a song for the reactivity series of metals including carbon and hydrogen
ExxonMobile stands fifth in the list of companies contributing to global gas emissions. At No. 3 is Gazprom, which has already started oil drilling in the Arctic which will eventually damage the Arctic ecosystem. 
They are also doing their part on turning public opinion against global warming. 
About 5-8 years ago, most internet users had a consensus that global warming is real. The debate was actually on how it should be implemented. Now, we see attack on the legitimity of the global warming, often trying to disguise it as natural climate cycle.
The biggest lie about climate change is that humanity can prevent it.
2nd law of thermodynamics... Can't stop that lol.
Also, 1/10 for using outdated "anthropomorphic global warming" propaganda from the 80s.
Also also, why didn't you use all the "climate change" propaganda from the 60s and 70s which said we were going to have an ice age?
Or before that in the early 1900's when they said the sea levels would rise and we'd all be dead?

Dumb.
why do you have maps of Kolkata and Copenhagen?
It’s funny how the only people who notice these “huge flaws” in climate change are the oil companies. Interesting.
What about the effect that causes the production of meat on global warming and climate change ???
i remember as a Kid in the 80's & 90's winter would be brutal it would barley get above 15°c and at night -5°c that might be "tropical" for some people but for us its cold! anyway, the past 5 or 6 winters has been an average of 32°c during the day and 15°c at night! i actually miss winter!
In the history of mankind, 50% of all carbon released into the atmosphere occurred in the last 30 years. Indeed, 
the last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist. The burning of fossil fuels and the chemical-intensive industrial agriculture are the main drivers of climate change. The good news is that humans have the power to stop, and potentially reverse, climate change, but the solution is not fancy new carbon-capturing technology (biochar is the way to go as far as sequestration goes / it would also reduce the use of artificial fertilizer production and nitrous oxide emissions). A significant part of the solution to climate change is to harness the power of Mother Nature. Harnessing the energy of earth (geothermal), water (hydroelectric), air (wind generators) and sun (solar cells and collectors) and, also, in the form of organic regenerative agriculture and the restoration of forests, peatlands, mangroves and other ecosystem habitats capable of drawing down and storing excess atmospheric carbon.
The title of this literally draws in every single demographic within the USA
Nuclear power should be expanded upon.
i love how the scientist returns with long hair and a better moustache
Awesome video guys !!!
Please keep making videos on this topic - it is so interesting and important for people to hear!
Jesse Klaver for president!
"KOLKATA" - west bengal - India
If you want to buy an environmentally friendly car buy a used car with a standard transmission. It makes more pollution to manufacture a car than it could ever use in it's life. The more complex the vehicle the more pollution is made during the manufacturing. Hybrids very bad.
Aluminum has to be separated by electrolysis, which is why it's not cost effective to make cars of aluminum. It also corrodes faster than steel. Won't last. Cash for clunkers was literally a massive Air Pollution project. Built cars destroyed. FAIL!
Well done America truly the greatest
This is soooo frustrating to watch. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BECOME A PARTIZAN ISSUE!! This is one of those things which are obviously a threat to us all. We came together to fix the hole in the ozon layer. We could have come together to fix this. This is a little bit more complicated to solve, but had we really put in the necessary effort  in the nineties and noughties, we'd be much better off now. Bush Sr of all people knew acknowledged the seriousness of climate change. 😱
I agree, but I think that all that wildlife killed wasn't due to climate change alone.
CO2 isn't a greenhouse gas it is simply to heavy to float in the atmosphere, if you look at the periodic table it will prove this fact. When CO2 is released into the atmosphere at a high temperature it will rise a bit and then when it cools down it falls to the ground and into the oceans where it is absorbed and utillized by the plants and fidoplankton. As far as acidification of the oceans try looking at the underwater volcanos.
I don’t trust this.  Scientists said New York City would be underwater years ago.  Plus, ice records show that in the past, the earth was two degrees warmer than it is now.
Science denial and apathy are the greatest threats to mankind. But the world is waking up.
I have a question for you to answer.. Why does coffee make everyone in my family tired? Especially me. After drinking coffee, I always fall asleep. Truthfully any caffeine makes me sleepy. But drugs like Benadryl make we wide awake, even though most people feel tired after.
How long is this alleged warming is going to take ? 
Always promises but never the real deal, I say welcome to a warmer climate.
Well line up against the firing squad
Before Exxon takes down the video due to “copyright”
Exxon are literally acting like they’re run by a Bond villain:

“Oh, sea levels are rising? Just build the oil rigs to be higher”
“Oh, artic ice is melting? Oh well some more oil there”
Scientist : if you continue this the earth wi-

Exxon : *cover ears* LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALLALALALALALALALA
Um, calling it climate “change” is like minimizing the warming part. Gotta quit being manipulated. It’s called gas lighting.
The obvious solution here is to breathe less.
jk thanks AsapSCIENCE for your wonderful work.
Smoking is like double horrible. First, you put smoke in the air TEHN PEOPLE JUST THROW IT ON THE FUKCIGN GROUND
So it is Bernstein
Okay i get it, but honestly what good comes out of this. Hating oil companies doesnt make people hate oil more. Fossil fuels are so energy rich and cheap that we have propelled the world population from about a billion to over 7.5 billion in a little over a century.

I think the benefits of moving off fossil fuels are vast. But the detriment of not finding a proper replacement will be catastrophic. 

You cant run all cars on electric, you cant power cities on wind and solar. We need to have a civil discussion instead of just finger pointing
Green house effect was discovered in 1800's, not 1980.
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE IT.
CO2 rise FOLLOWS temperature rise.
So, Exxon hired scientists that generated bogus predictions of global warming caused by use of fossil fuels then didn't like those predictions and wound up doing the right thing (ignoring the erroneous climate scientists) for the wrong reasons.

So, do some actual research and, if you have enough intelligence to make sense of all the available information, you'll realize that climate models are completely incapable of making any accurate predictions and probably will not progress to the point of becoming accurate for at least 50 years.
My mother is so uneducated. She says “but it changes all the time”
And...?   This is all very interesting, but none of it new.   We know burning oil causes C02 that contrbutes to Global Warming.  Its known.  The information has been out there for decades now.   And what?   Exxon suppressed knowledge that burning their product would cause more C02.  What else?  Anything?  I've seen nothing else.   What I mean is- what exactly do you think we would have done with that information back in the 70s given how little we've done with it today.  Today green alternatives make up a tiny fraction of what the world uses for power and there is zero indication we are close to increasing that percentage by any significant amount given the fact that we know one thing for certain- the world is not going to use less energy.  The world is aware. The cat is out of the bag.  Energy use continues to go up and today with our greatest level of technology we are decades away from a green solution. We were farther away in the 70s, unless you wanted to build more Nuclear power plants, and we know where the public was and is on that.  So I say...they lied.  So freakin what.  What's the difference?
If global warming isn't real, why new arctic shipping routes are open!?
Dooshbag claims "The burning of CO2 creates a greenhouse effect"

climate change cant be solved because companies only motive is profit.
Make a video about the impact of livestock farming on the climate too

Cloak and Dagger
One minor misinformation about climate change, it’s not really global warming. It’s more extreme weather. More heat than cold but the polar vortex still happened. Still mostly heat (and water because of heat) though
We were told the truth and we were told lies.
Most people chose to believe the lies.
Always dig to the beginning of anything.  The study of greenhouse gasses started in the early 60's.  This class of scientist were the same ones warning of a global freeze in the 1970's, it made the cover of Time magazine (which was a big deal at the time).  Sadly, this must be why this video suggests things started in 1982.  10 years later they reverse direction.  This means there was not enough data to make sound statistical conclusions; a 180 degree turn and BTW all reports were "peer reviewed".  By the 90's there was a short term warming trend and Al Gore was born.  By the 2000's there was another cooling trend, and Antarctica started gaining ice.  The ocean has risen 400 feet in the last 15-20,000 years, maybe a few more inches are coming.    Focusing on  100 years of a 20, 000 year graph is 0.5% of data, statistically insignificant considering what has happened.  If C02 doomsday is here then all the Tesla money would have gone into removing C02 and planting trees.
This guy doesn't even Know how Carbon Dioxide is created! It's idiotic.  Well made video, very informative, but Totally Wrong!
Exxon is like Umbrella corp in Resident Evil movie...
The earth is cooling since 2000, dude!
Been fouled, you have!  Do you think a company such as Exxon would want an increase in consumption but most importantly price, as can clearly be see. Just look at a price chart, it shows the clear path of fear for more consumption, the fear of losing what is right in front of them. 

And do you think the CIA, justs sits around all day monitoring peoples phones? Come on man! 

Think man,
The Green New Deal is no more than an attempt to make USA a socialist state. No political party cares about the climate they just want to tell you what you want to hear to get votes.
Why do u have a map of kolkata behind you? <3
The trolls who disliked this video should care, the bridge they live under will be flooded from climate change leaving them homeless.
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE 1922. I have 2 vids below that show this. Of Course we will experience changes in Climate. It'll do that without us doing anything. Eg The LAST ICE AGE.
A Floating platform doesn't need to be build higher idiot. It floats MORON. Scare tactics. If the sea ice in the Arctic melted, that wouldn't change the sea level. Its been proven that ice on Greenland has actually grown. The Sun has more impact on our climate then anything. I love how this guy claims to know what Exxon inside story is. Talk about a total fraud. CO2 is NOT a major contributor to climate change. This has been debunked for years. More CO2 actually would see massive improvements in crop growth and yield $Billions. Finally, this guys sounds like a Feminist. LOLZ. I wouldn't trust a thing he says.
There is no Global warming anymore its now just the weather or as scientists call it climate change.
I’ll be 31 how is this possible
Why do you have the map of Kolkata?
Ok how about nuclear power and getting the government out of the power industry?
Sea levels rise and the temperature gets warmer? OoOoooOo
Shutting down 80% of our energy production. Will literally kill half the population. That being the poorest among us
What a garbage video. The way you present the facts makes you seem emotional and opinionated, not like a credible source. The result will be that people who don't believe in climate change will simply not believe you. If you instead used a more scientific approach (like your name implies) and presented sources, explanations and rationality, you might have actually made a difference, instead of squandering the moment by making some claims and assuming that everybody is going to agree with you. The only thing your video will accomplish is make people who already know about climate change feel smug.
I don't know what scares me the most. If it's our current situation or that even now that we have all this information there is still people denying it and looking at science like it is a believe system. In fact this video, at this point, has 3.3k dislikes... :-(
Check out Patrick Moore's research on this issue, its way more informative.
The Green New Deal is a horrible deal that's also extremely expensive
So should I stop buying gas at Exxon? Would that make a difference who I buy gas from for my car?
I can’t believe that some people (especially conservatives) STILL deny climate change.
Trump doesn’t believe in climate change
Thank you! This topic is the most important one at the moment.
@6:00 Louis?
Which website was the bomb energy statistics from??? I am doing a research paper and want to use it as context evidence
Hey is it hot in here or is it just global warming. Yea both
Liberal (me) means not stagnate but progressive..why did you make such a negative connotation when you said that ...i lost anything you said after that ...good luck learning about reality
Ice age, the ice has been disappearing since then and is still disappearing, obviously due to the earth warming. After a few hundred years of barely noticeable change. It just seems to have received a little push recently. Wouldn't it be worthwhile to play it safe.
Research Chicago Climate Exchange. And also research Maurice Strong, his ties to wealthy individuals, NGO environmental creations, and his introduction to the UN.
One of the most unscrupulous players is Al Gore. He has gotten rich playing on fear mongering.
From what I could find, this scam goes back to the 1860s.
Research people! The only reason this is being pushed so hard is to, not take billions, but trillions out of your pocket.
People need to take more science classes. CO2 is what we exhale...all mammals do!
Y'all should make this trend!
Oil Rig platforms are elevated to withstand and escape storm surges and large waves in the ocean. Not saying you’re wrong sir but I know this is the primary reason for their elevated design.
Sure, cause hitting negative 32 in Nebraska is all apart of global warming.
Merchants of doubt is a very good watch
So...what should we do at this point?
3.1k think global warming is a lie. Sad.
Pewdiepie vs Tseries

EXXON  vs ASAP science

Find out next time on dragon ball z
Well carbon dioxide just simply doesn't insulate the earth. How can it keep the heat in?!! In a greenhouse, the glass stops the hot air from escaping. Carbon dioxide doesn't do this.
are you a vegan? you have a bit of inflammation in your face. calling card of veganism. anywho loved your video! when you said 9/10 of the deadliest heatwaves in recorded human history have occurred since the year 2000, well thats just not true because we have only been keeping weather records for the last 100 years. how many times do the weather predictions have to be wrong before people start realizing that its all a sham?? australian climatologists predicted that their country would be a desert in 10 years if people didnt cut carbon emissions. that was in 2005. (it may not have happened exactly the way i said it did but its the gist of the story so forgive me if i am a bit off on the info) anywho climate change is a scare tactic. we need co2 to survive. without it life could not be possible. plants take in co2. they give off oxygen. they clean the air and thrive on co2. our oceans clean the air. it gives off oxygen. our planet cleans its own air. it consistently goes through cycles. cooling and warming. the world isnt going to end if we dont cut co2 emissions.
I'm 12. Please  reduce you plastic, meat products, Co2. It will make my future better!
did he just say 60% of wildlife has been killed? wtf.. . my heart:  shattered.
This makes me so angry.
Animals and people are dying because of this, and are future generations will be left with next to nothing. Thanks Exon for doing all this! Good job 😒
George Bush : "We must do it." Translation, you must allow us to impose our will on you without question.
And they wonder why us supposed millennial are cynical and nihilistic.
Sorry to tell you, but climate have changed on this earth for billions of years, and will long after Exxon is history.
That's why we should not count on companies to fight global warming
"We wont feel the effects until 1995" -Exxon (1980)
Kinda a big problem if you (or your kids) plan on being alive in 15 years.
If only in the 80s there wasn't also the scaremongering about nuclear power...
When watching this inspires you to write a research paper on the topic for school 🎓
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM WITH EARTH IS HUMANS [PLASTIC WASTE IS A FAR GREATER THREAT THAN WARMING ]
These Big Oil execs, along with pTrump and his oil and coal lobbyist appointments, for example Scott Pruitt and Andrew Wheeler, all need to be charged and prosecuted as the psychopathic climate criminals that they are. They are fully informed, as shown in this video, and yet they have put company bonuses, dividends and investor returns ahead of the future safety of their own children. Today’s young people will make tomorrow’s laws. Go after them. It won’t make your life better but it might give some sense of justice.
This was great, thanks!
Renewables aren't that great for our environment either... the destruction of habitats for Solar Panels, the risk if endangered birds killed by both Solar Panels and Wind Turbines. However, global heating/warming was a scientific issues since the 1920s... we also have less carbon in our atmosphere than we did during the ice age. Climate change is real however I don't think humans affect it as much as we are claiming. I would say STAY AWAY from renewables simply because the life span of a solar panel is close to 30 years and what do with he petroleum based product? I say go for Nuclear. It takes less plutonium than the size if a rubiks cube to power someone's home for life...
Let's support Leo!
legit question:
do you (anyone reading this) think that climate change is a mix of TWO facts/arguments??
1) the Earth's average temperature fluctuates over millions of years, and is on the increase now anyway. BUT ALSO 
2) human activity is exacerbating the rise in average global temperature,
co2 ppm rose 30 ppm from the 40's to the late 70's at the same time the global temperatures cooled. So is there really a connection?
@AsapSCIENCE
So so so so so much misinformation in this video all I can do is facepalm.

Look, I'm 40.  They've been pushing climate change since at least around the time I was born.  They said back in 1989 that if we don't do something in 10 years we're doomed, the ice caps will melt, food will be sparse, etc etc.  Well 10 years goes by and then another 20 years on top of that and things aren't any different.  Now it's "if we don't do something in 12 years we're doomed".  How many predictions of doom do we have to go through that don't even come within a nuts hair of coming true before we finally say, "hey, these guys really don't know what they are talking about"?  I can promise you 12 years will come and go and nothing will be that different.  In fact, I'm willing to put on record that ice caps will grow and it will get colder.  Hell, it's already happening.  We've seen snow in the Arizona deserts.  MASSIVE snow falls in the mountains.  Utah has received almost 200% of it's typical snowfall this year.  The midwest had snow on May 10 last year.  There was basically no spring.  Winter extended much longer and it broke immediately to a mild summer.  

Sure, it's gotten a LITTLE warmer over the last couple decades, but nothing outside of natural variability.  Ice caps are still there.  In fact the Arctic is growing, slightly.  Antarctica was at an all time maximum in 2014.  Nobody ever talks about that though because it doesn't fit the narrative.  The Arctic was reduced by the same amount if not more during the 1930's and 40's, then grew back during the 60's and early 70's.  There are way more days recorded in the 30's and 40's over 90 degrees, 95 degrees and 100 degrees than the past 2 decades combined and doubled.  It's mostly a lie folks.  Yes we do cause some warming, but we don't have a clue how much and the more we study, the less it appears we do.  Exxon scientists were not 100% sure of anything.  They believed it because they started doing the study right out of a dip in our climate and when they saw warming in correlation with the C02 output they said, yep we're doing it.  However, the understanding of our sun, cosmic rays etc and how they affect cloud cover etc, was not understood at all during that time, as well as a myriad of other things that effect the climate.  The science wasn't there for them to be able to understand exactly what was happening.  IN FACT 30 years later we still don't have the science to understand everything.  The IPCC even admits to that.  

I want to pose a question to you and you tell me what is more likely.

A group of companies KNOW we are destroying our planet and chose to hide these facts in pursuit of short term monetary gain but causing absolute doom to it's company and all the people/animals/planet

OR

A group of people are making up fake claims of doom for political/monetary gain, KNOWING full well there's not immediate doom but also know they can get a power grab in this way?

Before anyone starts saying "yeah right, 97% of scientists are all in on a scam, your so full of it"  know this.  That 97% claim is bogus.  That number was reached by scouring papers that talked about global warming.  Out of those they only included papers that gave a position on whether or not it was man made.  Out of all the papers scanned, only about 36% of the papers took a position.  OF that 36%, 97% said it was caused by humans, BUT they didn't say how much.  It ranged from very little cause to totally caused.  64% of the papers took no position, but they claim 97% agree.  Total garbage.  A actual more recent poll was done of 1,821 meteorologists and only 52% claimed it's caused by man.  Only 37% of those that actually do weather predictions claimed man is the cause.  So as you can see, there is NO consensus.  It is very much a topic in debate.
I just don't understand why people under 30 just don't care or want to. No one tell's people that Gas and Fossil Fuels run 50% or more of ( Third World Countries ) Economies. It would take 195 countries in the world to work together.
Ha! This is the same song you used in your "100 digits of Pi" song!


Happy Pi Day everyone!
Global warming causes co2 rises. Not the other way around.
Dumb counts.
Back in the 70's we had the ice time scare. It was very cold and in the Middle Ages the Vikings were growing food in Greenland. Climate change happens since a billion years.Wasn't the arctic to by ice free in 2013? Oh well, it has become a religion by now and who remember "climategate" and "how to hide the decline..".
and why its hothothothot and no snow in winter only at the end?
The majority of our energy should be coming from nuclear power plants.
Climate change is a lie.... Ive seen to much data to think otherwise... you cant just go on one graph.. u gotta follow the paper trail... compare conflicting data... toss away contradictions... among many other things... and then draw a big picture. ;p;p;p
Global warming wants me not to have kids
I can see a future where survival for all living things is doomed and the only response is a group of mad people sacrificing Lee Raymond to Gaia in a futile attempt to gain forgiveness and resources necessary for survival but to no avail.
The thing that affected me quite substantially after seeing "Vice" was the whole vocabulary change segment. I decided I will intentionally call it "global warming" and not "climate change", even if to make only myself do more and think of it in more serious terms.
Thanks Dinosaurs for providing us the tools to get us extinct.
Scientists: watch out Exxon! Global warming is going to render Earth uninhabitable!
Oh no he has airpods huge stacks of money on! He can't hear us!
In my opinion, meat-eating "environmentalists" are the equivalent of, if not worse than, climate change deniers, like Rick McKee.
Wait, what the hell did he say about the Green new Deal?!
Lie about renewable energy: It's more expensive than burning fossil fuel. 
It's actually more expensive to use fossil fuels than renewable energy so yeah.
We can talk about reducing CO2 emissions all we want but no one really talks about what we are going to replace it with. Sure there have been advances in solar and wind technologies but it's not enough to meet our current demand for energy. 

Take Iceland for example. They are 100% renewable. Like no fossil fuel at all. They get there power mainly from geothermal. Apparently way back when they realized that importing oil to heat ther homes was too costly so they took the time and money in finding a solution that worked for them. There scientists realized that they could make there country's unique geography (aka volcanoes) work for them. Now all homes are heated with geothermal energy. Along with hydropower, they have become 100% renewable.

Now I understand that not every country has volcanoes but they can take what they have. Brazil has many rivers intersecting their country. Alot of their power comes from hydroelectric. If you want a USA example, Texas does ~20% of their electricity from Solar and Wind.

It's time to change the conversation. Stop talking about reducing greenhouse gases and talk about investing in renewable energy.

If you want more information here is a well researched video about it. 
These companies have blood on their hands.
You should do a video with Carlos Maza from The Strikethrough on Vox.
This scares me for the future, I feel helpless
If we're so concerned with the dangers of climate change then why not push for nuclear energy especially considering it's one of the most powerful and cleanest sources of energy currently available?
OK, the climate change myth actually started in the 1800's, and the world was suppose to end due to global warming in the year 1910.
Exon: study how bad i am
Scientists: you are a very bad boy
Exon: not bad enough
Destroy misconceptions please lol I'm conservative, however I do want science to be widely trusted and that comes with realistic projections and truths. Our world is not going to end in 12 years, that's not supported by science. Also lake Michigan was projected to have depleted even more by now with decades of rain to compensate for the loss. However in reality it has risen above it's initial level when first measured and hundreds of gallons are being pumped out to go to Texas at the same time. So yes we can agree we should do something however, I'm allowed to be skeptical of the way we should go about this.
I'm going to buy ANOTHER Challenger.
We keep saying '' We need to save the planet ''  when we should say '' We need to save humanity ''.. the Earth will regenerate itself when humans will be gone anywayyys 🌱
I will say that climate change is a real thing. However I still feel it is being “blown up” a little. One step that we are taking is investing in cleaner energy and electric cars. I feel we have more time than what is stated and I feel we are already getting in the right track to ensure this doesn’t escalate too much.
Honestly, I'm all about fixing the climate, but videos like this don't help.  Getting mad at ExxonMobil for... being a business doesn't solve anything.  In fact, even had they not led a misinformation campaign, what would have actually changed?  Solar and wind power only recent came of age, along with battery tech.  Fossil fuels have been the lifeblood of civilization, what exactly did you expect everyone to do?  Not drive to work and not buy food?  Your take on the world is retarded.
Whaaaat! They knew it for so looong!!!!! 😱

Ps: tu peux cliquer sur la tête si tu parles français 😜
They hired scienctist ? Then pretty much ignored them, Didn't see that coming 😂
cement ::: :
Absolutely terrifying. Thank you for making this video—global warming will wipe us out way before atomic warfare has a chance to.
I have begin raiding my bike to school for a little While Now. I feel better, have gotten faster and dont loose my breath as quickly. Plus i politi less :)
"The debate on climate change has been long" - "This of course is not true" he says, because this moron again is too lazy to do a simple search to find out even Wiki says it's been going on since the early 1800's.
This video is great, but is anyone interested in the environment we live in or just care about stuff ... if we care about the environment we live. Take action now. If you love the environment, luckily my channel is also working on this issue and you can follow it
Climate change is real. It has always been real and will always be real. The climate has been changing since the beginning of time.
Stop now it is no where near that number 400,000 
It is said that a war between Pakistan and India 2 of the smallest nuclear powers with only a few hundred between the 2 would cause the whole world to go into a nuclear winter
That much heat form 400,000 would literally vaporize everything

Not denying climate change just thats too high
Climate change is real. Is this not obvious
 Have you seen the fires in the last 3 years? You guys should take this video down
As if the human race will completely be eradicated if we don't do anything, such a hoax
thank you for making videos about both the problems and potential solutions, thank u thank u
The problem is that there is no concessus... most scientists in the study were not Climate Scientists, and those that were did complain that their views were not respected in the study, btw that study was by a guy that creats cartoons not a scientists.... The planet is indeed warming, how ever the models that are supose to predict this warming are falling, and the real climate scientists that have been analizing the temperures of the planets of the last thousands of years, have came to the conclusion that the planet for example in the Mediaval age was warmer, in the last century alone the temperature have go down and up again, we had 3 different warming periods 2 of them can't be blame by the CO2 emissions that we humans make, there was just not enough, and that suggest that it may be cyclic, however i do defend that we should have if possible 100% of clean energy, is always better to the planet.
One man with knowledge could save the earth...at least give it another 1000years of healthy life...but no! He decided to make money for himself! Such an asshole! And now the damage can’t be undone. He is worse than the terrorists. Anyway video is great as always. Loved the fact there was a frame of the map of Kolkata at the back. Good wishes from Kolkata! Peace! ✌🏻
Now they are trying to blame cows for global warming
Well we could thanks exon for that
why do you have to talk like that?? it is very difficult to listen to you.
Idk why Exxon decided to stay with dirty energy. I bet Exxon would be still as massive as a company today if they were more innovative with clean energy.
Whatever your politicians tell you is what their owners tell them, to tell you. Right now, you are told to worry about warming and video makers are rewarded with preferred suggestions and advertising revenue.
#GlobalWarmingisreal
It’s unfortunate that corruption & money is valued more than the generations to come. People don’t seem to realize they wouldn’t be here if this happened before us.
LOL. There is no debate. I can show you article after article full of research that shows that WE WILL NOT SURVIVE because WE WILL HAVE NO FOOD! The animals we eat WILL NOT SURVIVE with a global increase of 3 degrees C.
You forgot about the contribution of factory farming to the amount of CO2 being released. That one tends to be overlooked by many
next can we talk about how animal agriculture is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions?
What happens/has happened is psychological: Some people tend to asses wether they should or  shouldn't  commit to a goal that requires action based on wether their intuition tells them it is something that can merit success. But climate change, as Pres. Bush sr. said here, is very complex and cannot be fixed by one person or one nation solitary. So, at an early level of thonking about taki g on the task at hand they get a sense of overwhelm. Now, instead of feeling the existential dread and maybe paralysis of such a prospect, the instinctively distort what they are being presented with. The y are  not kettting it in i  order to mot have to deal with a task that would be very, very difficult anf would produce many negative emotions (because of frustratiin, slow progress, setbacks etc.) So the make the almost subconscious, preconscious, decision to rather focus on ehat has worked up till now, keep the system they are currently succeeding in running, and not trade it in for a potentially better future for others. And as a justuficatuon for that behaviour, they  to deny climate change is real. Because saying "It is real, but we can't or don't  want to di anything about it" isn't  aviable option.
If you smokes cigarettes and see that it is bas, you st top smoking. If climate change is bad, stop using stuff made by what makes climate change.
can you make a video about if essential oils actually help us humans??
It’s kinda sad. We are required to take environmental geoscience (I took the AP version) and the whole course is pretty much 1947104 ways we are messing up the earth through climate change and pollution. All this stuff is obvious and almost self explanatory for most of the people in my school, but we have all grown up with this science in our bubble of a school district. I think that it should be a required class along with algebra and chemistry not just in Mt. Lebanon but in all schools.
But the onu..
Trump : global warming is a myth🙃 🤓💩
So what is the exact precentage of human activities that contributes in climate change? How much CO2 is needed to raise global temperature 1 deg. C?
That's interesting, I'm not in the US an when I was at school in the early 2000s we were taught about climate change and sustainability at school, so I just assumed everyone knew this. The stats of the amount of ppl in the US who don't believe in climate change is really shocking.
The 1st paper on the potential of climate change was actually in 1827 by Joseph Fourier.
In Fortaleza, the temperature increase five degrees in ten last years.
Is it sconEs
or scOnes???? Which is the real scone ????
Doctrine is not science. You are not even allowed to disagree.
Send this to your friends! this is so important >:C
I'm pretty sure the Earth naturally goes through periods of extreme heat and cold. The reason for all of these record-breaking temperatures is because we humans have only been around since the end of the last ice age. Global warming is real, but humans are too small to make a major difference. If humans never existed, the Earth will still warm up, cool down, and so on. Humans aren't a substantial factor global warming, rather it is a coincidence that we humans are living in this period of time where the Earth is warming up. Humans have only been a part of this world for a minuscule amount of and we can only do so much in this short period of time we have been existing. I'm no scientist, but hey, that's just a theory.
This was never a debate. Its insane that the idea of climate denial is still a thing anywhere.
I'm with all the kids who skip school to protest climate change inaction. I'm a father of a 2 years old. Imagine how it feels for me to just recently realize what life I have condemned my child to live. What world she will live in. I, just like EVERY ONE living on this earth, owes it to himself and all others to WAKE THE F* UP and promote harsh, immediate change, for the sake of all the children and teenagers of the world. We change, or we condemn them to have a bleak, depressive, and possibly short future.


Me and my wife have walked in the march 15 climate strike with the over 100K students in my city. We have become vegan. We stopped consuming over wrapped products, and try to buy in bulk or unwrapped products. We are voting for the most eco-responsible party every chance we get to vote. We are switching to a fully electric car for our next one. 
We are changing our lifestyle for our child and for every one of you young people out there, so you and all of us can have a future. What will you do?
I'm not as worried about climate change as much as I'm worried of resource shortage as fossil fuel deposits dry up. Humans are pretty much roaches they would survive drastic climate change as we have before. But when fossil fuel dries up the globe might dip into global conflicts and infighting over the scraps of fuel and billions of people might die do to conflicts and panics. That is the main reason I am in favour of diversifying the energy sector (and I'm Dutch believe me I am scared of the sea).
THIS IS TRUE.    www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute-exposed-internal-documents-unmask-heart-climate-denial-machine
I cannot believe how people can still buy so much new shit (clothes, smartphones, everything), eat so many animal products and use their cars so much when all that leads to not only our children, but also us, to live in one hell of a future! 
I have no hope left. And I am so mad! How can people live their lives as nothing is going to happen?
I wish I lived in a world where everyone has empathy.


But on the bright side I don't have to think about retirement, yay?
I don't get it, does he believe in global warming or not?
I am actually scared our future is going to to dangerous and not a safe place and we won’t be able to run away from it 😞😞
Pollution and people are a contributing factor to global warming but are NOT the cause. Climate change didn't just suddenly spring into action either The climate has been in a state of perpetual change for it's entire existence; 2+ billion years. Example: The sea level has risen 200 feet in tbe last 2,000 years. The only force that can make Earth's climate fluctuate is the Sun and when the Sun produces more intense light/radiation or an increase of heat then Earth's climate becomes warmer. This is elementary school science and basic common sense. The reason nobody talks about this is because we cant do shit about it and we are in the back end of an extinction level event. So, to prevent chaos and total collapse of civilization we're not told the truth.
Was this upload at all inspired by the European protests?
Wait let’s say it goes really bad, we still can drop some nuclear weapons in the desert an cause a temperature drop
HEY EXXON IF THE EARTH DIES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET MONEY 

Do they realize they are killing the earth for money they won’t be able to use?
My only issue is that there's only really a consensus when you ignore the papers on climate change that were uncertain. ~12k papers on climate change were looked at, and ~7.9k had no opinion, or were uncertain. So it's less of a scientific consensus, and more like 2/3 of all engineers shrugging their shoulders when asked if the bridge was going to collapse, or not.

Among the 97% who took the stance that man-made climate change is real, 2910 out of the 3974 said that man is causing less than 50% of the warming. Which is more like 73% of engineers thinking the bridge will collapse just from natural causes

It doesn't change that we still need renewable energy for the sake of having an energy source for if we manage to burn through all of our oil, though. It's just that ignoring a few massive details like this feels disingenuous, and calls into question everything else that's used to prove man-made climate change. Especially when scientists at NASA have been told to fall in line with the scientific consensus to avoid any "PR Headaches," that they would have to deal with.

In the end, there are climate change deniers, because how shadily some of the data is handled, and used. Misuse of information, and influence to force a scientific consensus, rather than allowing that consensus to form naturally will cause push back no matter what side you're pulling for.
GASP! THEY LIED TO YOUR MOM!
Everything has an alternative,except Mother earth-Remo
Climate change in reality is not as bad as it is made to seem in this video. The earth warmed .9 degrees last year. In the big scheme of things it isn’t that much. The earth since its existence has gone on natural heating and cooling periods. That’s why in the 70s while this research was being done we were actually cooling. The effects are not as extreme as desertification. It will not affect climate of anywhere but the arctic. The ice caps melting would cause a rise in sea level but with more and more technology being created we will make innovation to combat that. Climate change is truly made to get people mad at the government and oil companies to create chaos. It’s not as bad as you think it is. Maybe we should ask the question of why people in power bring up climate change to the public? Do they have a vested interest in electric car companies? Maybe they hold stock in wind/solar energy? Truly the minimal damage we have done can’t be stopped because our economy relies too heavily upon fossil fuels for industry.
Y'all should be reading Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating ClimateTragedy, by Jem Bendell. We're already screwed. They've already killed us.
Don't politicize climate change! I'm conservative and I agree this is one of the greatest threats to humanity!
there’s no science behind Democrat Climatology: You just believe it or you must be a climate denier.
Would it help to make more white buildings,  or use  more second hand in my opinion white things in general , in the long run, to cool down the aarth? Like in warm countries, white walls reflect more sunlight & therewith more warmth. Would it help ? Maybe it just helps a little, but i tink little things are the only things we can do right ? Or idon'tknow. These are many possibilities right ?
Has anybody here been effected by an actuall effect of global warming cause our beaches here are still the same levels they have always been. How is that possible? More water is more water right?
You know what's crazy? I've seen some anti climate change people post YouTube videos on debunking climate change using the global cooling argument. The way they misrepresent evidence and spread misinformation is crazy.
I suggest for everyone to add the Arctic, and the Antarctic, to their weather app on their phones. Monitor it daily, and watch the temperatures to support their argument for or against global warming
Love the video man haha made me laugh a good few times
Climate changes would acure anyways but the fossil burning is speeding it up. Im not supporting these companys btw.
Elon Musk is da key!
im not saying i trust george bush. but i dont trust you either.
c a p i t a l i s m
Is there really hope for our next generations? I feel like we're just doomed :(
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD AL GORE AS PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF GEORGE BUSH >:(
This guy is so animated! Lol I love it 🤣
Can we just talk about how genuinely terrified I am for our future and the earth? Like not just posting oh it’s an issue I’m scared, but IM ACTUALLY scared of climate change yet nations and government don’t do anything. Me as a teenager and many other regular civilians, there’s really not much we can do other than make statuses etc because we have to carry on with our own lives. I just wish people with power would actually do something.
Can anyone name the background music running around 1:30
I can't believe that developing countries know about global warming more than the "all mighty america", I can't believe how politicians dare lay a hand on science, I can't believe how uncultivated, uneducated, uncivilized civilians dare claim that science is lying yet believe in some rich dude just cause he has "charisma", people need to wake up, stop making money and politics interfere in deciding your future. Great job asap science your videos are so useful and helpful
bruh i didnt know this guy was a communist tho lol
So Republicans deny it for gain but  Democrats go and promote it... for gain. Dems are using climate change as a bludgeon to put themselves in power. Both sides are wrong! We just can't win.
Great video. Last few seconds were a little uncomfortable to watch though!
Will you please do a video of if daylight is longer in summer and shorter in winter. I’ve been fighting with my girlfriend all day and we can’t really find a clear answer
Make the mess and let the younger 1  settle it... Naise.
So good. Thank you for this.
Good god this host is obnoxious. The video extremely oversimplifies the issue and offers no viable alternative. He also doesn’t discuss the scale at which humans affect the environment vs how it would be trending without human activity. Yes, we need to scale back on fossil fuels, and I think both sides actually agree on this. But we’re dependent on them because there’s no viable alternative (other than nuclear) so it’s easier said than done. Not going to watch his next video, I think I know where he’s going with that green new deal (which green peace even admitted would destroy civilization)
4:31 Minor correction to “The burning of CO2 creates a greenhouse effect that warms the Earth.”
Should be: “The burning of hydrocarbons emits CO2, which creates a greenhouse effect that warms the earth.”

CO2 is not burned, but is the product of burning in a combustion reaction.
If people really want to stop climate change then they should go vegan. Methane from animal agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change. More than all of the transportation systems combined. The only reason why there is so much methane being produced is because there is such a high demand for animal products. If the demand for those products go down, then the supply will go down. In other words, as more and more people go vegan, the amount of animals bred into existence will decrease.
Haha now try to explain the world government and how they now control the weather.
And because virtually everyone who watches this channel and their social circles believe climate change anyway, this video sadly has no effect...
I am a denier my evidence John Stossel
How does diet affect the environment, mainly global warming ?
I love you channel created laddy
imma get myself bmw before its too late
okay guys but is the SQUIP possible (Super Quantum Unit Intel Processor)

just look it up on the internet its fictional but the book was written in 2004/2005 and set 10 years in the future (2014/2015) so pLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COVER IT
Buddy Exxon is not from the 70's we called it standard oil. Remember Rockafeller like the 2nd richest man in history, yeah that's Exxon.
5:56 - is that Morty?
Thank you!! Finally!! Best regardings for and from Turkey!
Talk about hope in your next video💕
CO2 is not a pollutant!  It is a naturally occurring gas that all animals produce and your average human exhales close to 500 lb of it every year.  It is the second most important gas in our atmosphere behind oxygen.  Without at least 150 PPM all life on the planet begins to die.  Near the end of WW2 we were at 180 ppm and approaching extinction level Lowe's of CO2.now the burning of fossil fuels has raised us to approximately 400 PPM.  Which has had a greening effect on the planet.  Everyone talks about the possible negative effect of CO2 but they ignore all the positive benefits, like increase crop yields which have doubled since the 80s.
Ehh, no.... Exon scientists were not the first, or novel in the way the authors of the video say they are.

 Arvid Högbom, could be considered one of the first, and he made his discoverys in the late 1800s.  Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin also advocated for the carbon dioxide hypothesis. Wrote a book called "An Attempt to Frame a Working Hypothesis of the Cause of Glacial Periods on an Atmospheric Basis". It was also proven around that time different chemicals, including Co2, does cause a warming effect. Svante Arrhenius first calculated the extent we would warm, before the turn of the century. Hans Suess in 1955 did a analysis and discovered that the co2 levels were being effected in the air, by oil companies. In 1960, Charles David Keeling did actually prove that co2 was rising, and we were on a path to warming. Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald also, after keeling, made a calculation of HOW much the climate would change, giving the current path.

I know this is just a little semantics, and was probably cut for sake a brevity. But its important I feel that people don't get the idea all this was started in the last 50 years; we've know of this for well over 150 years. I think the author intended this to only a segway to the topic of the modern attention of the masses. But still, misinformation is misinformation. Oil companies DID NOT discover climate change, at all. They discovered certain effects, gathered from theories well established before them.
Hey what about the main cause ASAP... Eating meat aka animal agriculture. Go vegan and save the world.
i live in chicago, and damn... the climate keeps changing... why can't the climate stop changing?  like if we could wait until late spring and then make the climate stop changing... that would be perfect!  those damn climate change deniers... they should have to all live in chicago, and I can go live some place where the climate doesn't change like the way its supposed to be!
I'm sorry to say but, I think nobody is denying that global warming is a thing. I think people only mostly debate about how we should tackle the problem. Debate is more about Nuclear power vs Wind/Water. In the end it's about money, which is a actually a good thing, because the worst thing for the climate is poverty. (Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker)
this exactly what I would like to translate so Spanish speakers can get this information
Off with their heads
CO2 is just plant food which has little effect on warming. Without it we would all die, animals and plants included. Stop thinking we are going to solve the worlds problems by reducing CO2. Without the cheap energy obtained by burning fossil fuels we would not have doubled the worlds population and increased the standard of living. Cutting CO2 will not save the planet, it will only kill more animals, plants and people. The world is currently on a cooling trend with shorter growing seasons, so we need more CO2, not less.
Great explanation about this subject. Thanks, my friend!
So is it global warming or climate change?
100% agreed man, if global is real its real slow its just a fake issue run by liberals and corporations
Hey AsapScience! This is a great video that I fully enjoyed and I wish to share with more people. However not everyone speaks English so your message is a bit limited to the English speaking community. Would it be possible for you to do something about that?
Big oil runs the show, they perpetually fund climate change organizations and harbor fear of scarcity in order to prolong the consumption of fossil fuels indefinitely and have been doing this for decades. The fact is that free energy technology exists but oil companies have so much power that it is suppressed and many people have died because of it.
No one will take climate change seriously until all the rich people who keep talking about it sell their beachfront properties.
The background music, 3.14159 THIS IS PI FOLLOWED 2658589. (I don’t know if that’s right tbh)
I honestly believe that The Peoples Front Of Judea are in charge of bringing these big energy companies into line.
I just wrote a paper for my political class on global warming and my bf don’t eve live in global warming
Im not sure what to believe bcz All plants and trees need co2 so why would it damage our atmosphere
Capitalism will be the death of America.
Please make a video about how terribly enormous number of cattle (70000000) on Earth impact the climate change!!!!Because it was proven that this reason is much worse than oil production!! And no one talks about it that much!!
Stephen Hawking died exactly one year before this video was uploaded...R.I.P.
Please make this video viral on twitter
Warmers think we are doomed again but I was wanting better weather(short term climate) predictions since they know what the climate will be in 50 to 100 years - maybe I would believe if they were accurate for 30 days or 20 or 10 rather than 3 to 5 days at 50%
How come I can't get vaccinated for the flu like how I am vaccinated for measles?
hehehthis vid has 666k veiws
Can you guys make a video on how animal agriculture is next to fossil fuels when it comes to damaging the environment with greenhouse gases?
they’re flexible. skip to 2019 and gas companies advocate for renewables and against nuclear: to sell more natural gas.
Climate change = Loss of habitat = Mass extinction.  Just as any dinosaur.
This is the kind of stuff we need to get trending, not 'what I bought for my cat'. I, like 105,000 other students in Australia, participated in the world wide school student protest against climate change today (15/3) and I urge you to join any occurring near you. I feel like my efforts are pathetic in the scheme of things but at least it's something because it is both spreading awareness AND putting pressure on the government to listen and make a change now. 
Future of our planet > $$
And I've heard the argument that companies do want what's best for society.

Sure.
our global economic model is the real killer because its based upon survival of the fittest,
and the evolution of humanity, which is second biggest lie ever told.
 otherwise known as : take, make and throw away and do it all again to produce wealth.
 Mankind are on a dead end track called self destruction and whats really sad is we have no choice its what we must do to survive, at least in the short term
Climate change was known well before Exxon studied it. It was first hypothesized more than 100 years ago, and the CO2 warming effect proven shortly after. ATT even acknowledged that the climate was warming due to human use of fossil fuels back in the 50s.
How bout we just decimate India and China? They pollute the most.
The climate models have never successfully predicted observed climate, and objective science simply does not support the predictions of the models... namely that CO2 is a primary forcing agent of temperature.  The correlation is non-existent (except in the make believe mathematics of the models).  It's well known that CO2's warming effect rapidly diminishes as more is added to the atmosphere, and water vapor by far is the most abundant greenhouse gas.  CO2 is not a pollutant, it's essential for life.  Plants need 3 things to grow: sunlight/water/CO2... aka photosynthesis.  Most plants evolved during periods of significantly higher levels of CO2, as much as 5 times higher.  Each human emits about 800 pounds of CO2 every year simply by breathing.  After 150 years of all natural CO2 emissions (oceans/plants/animals/humans/volcanoes) plus CO2 from converting hydrocarbons to energy...  of every ten thousand molecules of atmosphere, only 4 are CO2.  Even the IPCC acknowledges the claim of "extreme weather" due to CO2 has no empirical support. The climate faithful understand so little of their own religion, yet cling with vigor to the belief their religion is somehow science.  On the other hand, people who practice one of the other major religions never mistake their religion for science, or vice-versa... it's a phenomenon unique to the climate faithful.
Superficial tripe. H2O warms the earth. Not CO2. You need to get your ramblings right.
BMW, Audi & VW thinks it's all a load of baloney.
So what do you climate folks have to say about Al Gore and his home on the beach. Seems to me he doesn't believe his own bs.
I work in a coal fired power plant 🤫
The drills in the sea needs to be high because of tides
One of the many reasons I went to the recent student climate change protests. Was an amazing experience despite a few people telling me I was either (a) too young to be caring or (b) was told I was misinformed and climate change wasn’t real.
There is not only alliance between oil companies and climate change skepticism, there is another alliance with nationalists, because nationalism can’t fix “global” problems like climate change, they went on to reject climate change at all
Glad to see a big channel talking about the Green New Deal
ASAPScience: please cite sources on the screen when you make points, it will increase trust in your viewers and maybe convince more people of your accuracy in research.
Annyway Trump said it was a hoax made by china
Predatory companies, screwing over people and the planet itself.
I also would like to point out that facts about climate change are supported by NASA. Friggin NASA.
good luck with the green new deal
HAHAHAHAHA The "Green" New Deal... Have you even read that thing?
10,000 students went on strike and protested against the government today in Australia to get them to do something about climate change
Thank you for this great video
Honestly I don't understand how exxon is even still in business. I only know of 1 exxon location within a 50 mile radius of where I live, and everyone I know never goes there
Your lifetime will have to he dealing with a Super Grand Solar Minimum.  Its not you,  its not CO2.... its the sun  !
when in doubt.

just move to canada.
Both sides lie to you. Think for yourself. Do your own research. Don't even trust this guy either, bc he has 8 milliom subscribers and can talk about some interesting things. Global warming has been happening, way before oil companies. Climate change is always talked about, pointing fingers at both sides. The fact of it is, none of you are prepared to live without fossil fuels. What are you going to do, stop driving to work? Keep all your lights off? No your not. Is climate change a serious thing, hell yes, but it isn't the end of the freaking planet as we know it.
The question isn't that the earth's climate is changing, the question is, is it the doomsday prediction that we should expect? And if so, can we realistically do anything about it
The word global warming is scary that's why they created climate change.
Here we are. On our phones expressing our thoughts about something important, while some 12 year old, knowledgeless fortnite player tries to be funny.
Climate science has become a big business. More and more people are seeing the hoax.
NO WAY THEY LIED TO MY MOM
And also this totally undermined the credibility of science. Cuz now everyone is skeptical of research having been funded by special interests.
Exxon was obsessed with innovation? I thought they were obsessed with oil and profit at the cost of everybody else.
1. Is the earth warming? - Yes
2. Is the earth warming from human addition of CO2? - Yes
3. Will this change lives of humans in the future? - Yes, some areas will be less fertile, while others will become more so. (Looking good Canada!)
4. Would I call myself a climate alarmist? - No


I agree with the principle of global warming and climate change, but I would argue that the effects of CO2 are exaggerated and some key things about how it interacts within the ecosystem are conveniently left out of most of these type of videos. Such as the effects are logarithmic and one hell of a stimulant for plant growth. (easy enough to look up)


With that said I am still in favor of limiting fossil fuel consumption, not because I think it is going to fry us all in 15 years(we were told this in schools in 1990).  We need to limit them because eventually we will run out, and without any other good viable ways to create the energy our society is so utterly dependent on, it will effect humanity in greater ways than the eventual warming of the earth.
I knew that.
I liked this channel before it got so political
Can you make a video about what happens when you snap your fingers?
Anyone who was thinking about the Pi Song from 1:20?
hi i am doing a school debat on climate change and this has been suuuuuuuuuuuper helpful
Yeah I trust those Exxon scientists to this day.
jk those same scientists thought the world was gonna end in year 2000 XD!!!
Uses the fact that people think it's real as evidence of it XDDD!!!!
Climate change denial just wasn't created by Exxon XXXXXDDDDDDXDXDXDXD!!!!!!!!
Climate change denial exists because the climate literally has had constant patterns of warming and cooling each year with an average of 10 degrees higher or ten degrees lower on average!!
People deny climate change because they haven't seen ANY proof no matter what some oil scientists say about it. Don't revere scientists as gods unless they are Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein.
That was fun down in the comments but  I'm out of popcorn now.  cya
I moved to Columbus Nebraska 3 year's ago things look perty bad here
I thought they were going to say humans are not the main cause of global warming.
uhm we need co2 scrubbers. We need trees.
Make a video on how agriculture is contributing to climate change by greenhouse gas emissions, pollution of water by feces, deforestation. Is it as an eye opening story as this is. 
You can watch a documentary cowspiracy to get a basic idea. Although I do not want to say it is 100% true there IS in fact a great deal of truth in the ducumentary
I just wanted to say everything in this video is true from my experience following the news in the 80s and 90s. It's unbelievable to me that so many people deny climate change. They must be very young or have terrible memory. Politicians who deny climate change are either lying or completely ignorant. Yes, we can argue about which steps to take to prevent climate change, but to do nothing at all is unacceptable and irresponsible and I don't know why some people don't want to pay taxes for that. Of all the things you pay taxes for unnecessarily, climate change isn't the one to get hung up on.
Solar and wind is not reliable 
Nuclear plant is deadly
Hydro dam kill fish


The only alternative power resources is Thorium.
So...if CO2 is a pollutant, what would happen if we got rid of it?  Let's make that our goal.
*Launches "We're sorry" campaign*
this fake science  that you indulging, do you have anything to back up those claims? or is this just what you or the general population assumes?
Renewable energy like solar and wind aren't enough to replace fossil fuel. Nuclear is safe and zero carbon emission.
Why did Lee Raymond received a Woodrow Wilson Award? Is that a joke?!?
you guys should make a one hour special
I am actually about to go to a sort of competition that's sponsored by ExxonMobil. It's a share-some-ideas-and-maybe-well-do-something-idk type deal
Oh of course. Climate change. 
Back in the 70s-80s articles were released saying the next ice age was going to happen in the 2000s. You idiots call yourselves “scientists” and say that climate change is caused by humans, hands down, no more testing or evidence needed, and if I oppose it I’m a denier. Wow! that’s definitely how science works! My weatherman can’t tell me if it’s going to be sunny tomorrow but he figured out our warming trend is caused by humans, and not say, the idea that the earth naturally cools and heats over long periods of time do to things like sun spots. Believe humans are the cause of “climate change”? Alright! You want to hear the real cover up behind climate change?
The political left and the Democratic Party have used the argument that humans are the cause of climate change to punish big corporations, put a stop to our oil industry, and basically destroy capitalism entirely for a new wave of “democratic” socialism. Let’s take a look at one of the main figures leading the left, AOC. She proposed a “New green deal” which wishes to get rid of all combustion engines (your car), planes, and FARTING COWS (I wish this was a joke) by 2020 do to the evil effects of climate change. Also repair and remodel every single building in the United States to be “energy efficient” (Including your home!) To do this her and other leaders on the left want to... you guessed it! Tax those evil corporations who are literally making money off the industry they wish to destroy! Makes so much sense doesn’t it? 
I’m sorry, but if you believe humans are the main cause of climate change, hands down, with no other explanation you have no right to call yourself a “scientist” just because you got a degree at some leftist loon college where your professor taught you the glories of socialism and communism, two economic system which have led millions to death and poverty. 
If you do still believe that humans are the cause, hands down. Please take into account that 
A. The United States is not the leading producer of Carbon or pollution, China is.
B. Just because you stop drinking out of plastic straws, become a hippie and destroy corporations and capitalism doesn’t mean the Chinese and other counties also will. 
C. The best way to produce less fossil fuels in innovation. As technology SLOWLY increases, we will EVENTUALLY rely less on fossil fuels. 
In conclusion. 
Climate change is propaganda from the political left. 
If you believe humans are the cause of it, a free market is the best way to stop it, not government control. 
If you disagree with me please leave your hate comment below calling me a racist, evil, capitalism loving, brainwashed denier.
The only way oil companies will be brought to justice is if we wage war against them!
This hit hard. I'm kinda freaking out now cause I feel like I'm gonna die during the end of the world. Like what do I do  oml
"were"? they're still doing it.
Just remember which politicians and executives sold your future to become wealthy. I'm an older guy, so most likely the worst effects will happen after I'm gone.
Don't let them win. Dammit. I know you can save the planet.
But it's cold outside
How dare they lie to my mom
This seems to happen often with many companies with dangerous chemicals, remember the lead paint researcher?
Eventually Americans will kill all climate change deniers right!! The UN says there is only 12 years left before it is irreversible!! Following scientists ( men) is like following the Bible writing by men!! 2 faiths and two religions!! Are we ready to put our faith in what these scientists say!! Or trust what the Bible says?

“Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.”
‭‭Hosea‬ ‭4:1-3‬ ‭KJV‬‬


“The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭24:5-6‬ ‭KJV‬‬
1. That it exists
Can anyone hear the Pi song they made in the backround?
Still not sure if I believe in it or not but you provide a great argument I appreciate this video! It’s good to learn from both sides  and this is a good video to help learn from one of those sides!
Oil is definitely a problem but animal agriculture is even bigger - are you vegan?. The United Nations reported in 2018 that according to the World Economic Forum, the beef and dairy industry is responsible for “more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s biggest oil companies, with the combined emissions of the top meat and dairy companies exceeding those of highly industrialized nations such as Germany or the UK”
Source : 
Please talk about the extremely dangerous effects of animal agriculture  relating to climate change in the next video!
Amazing work
Why do you have a map of kolkata??
I miss the just whiteboard videos
Ok the different voice of the narrator is throwing me off lol
And yet you young voters were too (name your reason here) to vote for Clinton and thereby allowed the most environmentally destructive, fossil fuel promoting, amoral conman to become President. Which allowed the Republicans to do maximum damage to the our climate. SO YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!!!!
What about global dimming?
When I’m in my 50s I am gonna burn a lot of fuel to add in :)
It doesn't have to be political  it's a fact global warning is REAL! Get that through your head
Could you please make a video on how we can help earth?
YES! MORE IMPORTANT CONTENT!
I agree that it is a problem, but my issue is what people want to do about it. They want to just limit the amount of CO2 emmisions allowed tremendously and hope it'll fix everything. Doing that would probably wreck the economy. What we should probably do instead is a gradual switch over to other energies, and promote companies like Tesla who are working on making electric vehicles more affordable and commonplace for everyone, even if they aren't now. We should probably also focus more on nuclear energy, which has a tremendously small amount of waste product for the energy output as opposed to most other forms of energy. These things together could make the economy stronger along with the environment, instead of having an inverse relationship.
Thank God all the models have been wrong.
This video is excellent .Well done. However we also need to acknowledge the other big cause of climate change COWSPIRACY.
Less than 100 years even the nasa declared it. Last 3 December over 2000 scientists and à representatives of many many country were meeting for this and all declared the same thing if we do nothing by 2050 pretty much dead or dying of sickness, malnutrition etc. We have to act big NOW. Pressuring the governments to stop the financial support from oils companies that he gets and we need to pressure the oils company and the meat industry to switch and produce what we demand : vegan substitue, grow in lab meat, electric/etc  hemps  car. We have the technology, we have the companies that does it, we have the power cus we are the demand and they are the offer. This is our lives, the one of ours kids, our planet, our humanity. We need to save ourselves in dignity
Yeah no I wasnt lied to, im not American. The rest of the world knew this decades ago. Nice video though, keep going!
Its believed the deniers are based on the fact that it is and has been too late to do anyting about it...Natural self feeding loops are in play and we do not DO NOT have the technology to stop them..  Enjoy your life..
For 40 years the oil and gas industry, led by Exxon and Shell hid the truth about climate change and buried the findings of their scientists..  
That's global terrorism...
I wonder how much pollution is made from our increased consumerism, we are buying more and more for cheaper and we expect companies to keep up with this demand. We also idolize rappers and social media stars who show off with private jets, expensive cars and massive homes. Im not sure how much raising the price of gas by 10 cents through a carbon tax will really do anything other than tax the low income.
If you have no idea about climate change you should just keep quiet.
Dude I agree with you and support your video but why are you using fake glasses?
EXXON GIVE IT TO YA
You are an awesome communicator
This video is all a lie
I just got a ad for a car before this video...seems ironic
I REALLY enjoyed this episode.  Not that I have disliked others, disagreed perhaps.  This is a grab you the shoulders, slam you into a chair, force eye open, “A Clockwork Orange” type of revelation.  Kudos, and impressive, MOST IMPRESSIVE‼️‼️‼️✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😵😵😵🆘🆘🆘🦠🦠🦠⛽️⛽️⛽️💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼⚰️⚰️⚰️🚨🚨🚨
This is how civilizations die, they use all of their environmental resources and then die. 


I hope this is still up when the world goes down
Thank you for this!! Currently studying this at university and ecologists really stress that it doesnt get enough attention. Education is the first step to mitigation, especially when there's damage control to be done🌍❤
Whos here because you watched that china uncensored episode
isn’t it iiiiiironic don’t ya think 
i replayed that part 10 times. but jokes aside, great vid.
What is the temperature of the Earth & how much has it change. provide sources & figures please. 


What, nothing?. ( well, there's the exact science I guess?)
We got 12 years to change
This guy isn't about to change the mind of my F350 with pollution controls illegally removed gorilla minded "alpha" male incel brother who will see this guy as a total "soy boy".
this video is miss leading (im not saying climate change doesnt existed).But the knowledge on carbon emissions effecting the climate has been around for alot longer then 1980... you can see that when you look at the effect of coal in great Britain. People knew about the effects on coal (not to the same degree) but saying exxon discovered climate change and covered it up is trying to paint a miss leading picture. (Also dont site wikipedia and news articles and claim to be an accurate, please only use published journals so i a viewer can actually be informed)
Thanks for speaking out on this.
climate change is real but can someone tell aoc the earth isn’t going to end in 12 years
What you choose: frightening truths, or comforting lies
No science in this video.
Love this
I think the main focus in trying to combat climate change should be put on the animal agriculture industry
Me, an asian: wait, since when is global warming isn't real?
Right. If you'll excuse me, I need to join 'Don't make a wave committee', or, as it's known today...




Greenpeace.
Sorry.  Just because people keep repeating that this is settled science, does not make it so..... awkward...
Methane is actualy a bigger problem
Ehhh, what happend to this channel?
Green New Deal!! Please! 2020 for CHANGE like actual change! We are killing the Earth!
Omg thank you so so so so much for this video
Climate change is obviously real.
I wonder if these scientific research papers took in to account the changing effect of the sun, the growing plant life and the effect of natural greenhouse gases. I thought I'd learn something but I was sure you were a lefty right away. Wonder why?
One volcanic eruption could defeat all greenhouse gases ever emitted. You're lying. Co2 is plant food. Hit me up and I'll explain further
If the Light cant get how can it come in then
i’ve said it once, ill say it again. Im a Republican but i believe in climate change and i believe it is a major concern that its effects are near-irreversible.
Dude forget science cleaning this mess hwo needs to clean this mess are the laws! For example here in Portugal you have to use co2 filter but the ticket I cheaper that buying the filters so no one uses filter! This is a good example of the laws not trying at all because science may be inventing solar panels etc but if the people in high rols don't help there won't be any science making the world better again
Yes the temperate of earth was on a steady increase from 1911 to 2015 also a steady rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere there is evidence to support that 100% but there’s no direct link that doesn’t involve a theory to support that rising CO2 causes irregular weather and temperatures. There is a major problem but it’s not what everyone thinks. It has to do with the sun changing and moving through cycles it is a real thing that people need to be aware of. Please research this further on your own and do a video on this. @asapscience
Turn to God and repent from your sin and God will fix what no man can!! We did not create this earth!! God did so He knows how to do fix it!! Not Us!! But if you want to follow the scientists and what they say than try as you may!! The Green new deal will end in disaster!! Take at the Carbon Tax passed in France and see the yellow jackets protests that spread all over Europe!!
for the people that are deniers of climate change or the ones that don't think its co2. Please for sake of the life not only in the USA but the world. spend a day on researching information on it from people that spend there life studding it. Don't get ur information from party driven sites. For people that don't know here is a fun fact, in 1800s it was proven that co2 gas with methane gas have greenhouse effects before climate change by human activity was even an idea. don't do the research  because some random person say it on comment section but do it if u have a loved ones that u wanna leave them a future
My country is pretty hot and humid and last winter we've experienced a rather short winter, nothing outta the ordinary just that it got warm a bit early and that it didn't rain as much, by March temperatures were the regular hot as shit weather, this year however, temperatures dropped to what's considered freezing, it rains every 2 weeks now, clouds clear up, it goes up to around 25c, it stays that way for 5 days, then it drops to around 14c and it rains a bit, and it goes on, were past the date where it's supposed to be warm already and it actually rained today, if this is happening in winter..  then who knows what'll happen in summer... climate change is real and those oil companies need to be punished for all the lies they've spread, I wish things will fix up soon, even tho it looks like we're out of luck...
yall i b living in singapore and we are dYING due to the hEAT ,, GLOBAL WARMING IS 300% real ok sis out!
It's time to do something about it! The problem has been addressed! The disease has been diagnosed! We need to treat it! We need to do something about it! No more waiting around, let's take charge and fix it everywhere once and for all!
The green new deal 😂😭
Man this needs to be seen by so many people
Finally someone talking about the lies about science that are out there!
There is no Greenhouse effect. Not Now! Not Ever!
1.3k people will die of heat stroke and think it's a "natural process."
GLOBAL WARMING IS A REAL THING, BUT SAYING HUMANS ARE CAUSING I IS GIVING US TOO MUCH CREDIT. THE ICE AGE STARTED AND ENDED AFTER ALL. THE EARTHS TEMPERATURE CHANGES OVER TIME. IT IS PART OF NATURE
Was the ring at the start on purpose?
I heard the pi song in the background!
Happy pi day btw :)
No empirical data here to prove climate change.... waste of time
After decades of rhetoric that the world is ending as we know it due to an increase in CO2, we still haven't seen any evidence whatsoever that the world is indeed in crisis. Far from it. The polar bears have not disappeared, but have grown in numbers. Ice in the antarctic is not melting but growing. Glaciers continue to grow and retreat just as they always have. The earth has not warmed beyond what is expected following the little ice age. According to NASA global temps have dropped over the past two years. But, who knows. Those folks have no qualms when it comes to manipulating the temp data to get a desired result and have been caught on several occasions doing just that.  People are still building real estate on the oceans shorelines and banks are still making loans for them to do so. More people continue to build in floodplains despite knowing that floodplains actually flood occasionally. Deserts are getting greener. No increase in hurricanes or their severity. The list goes on. It is all rhetoric designed to get you to give up your rights and hard earned money to government. It IS absolutely about control. Folks, there is NO scientifically validated evidence to support any of these ridiculous and unproven catastrophic claims of doom and gloom. They will never give up until they own you. Have a nice day and please stay engaged. This is a war.
Exxon mobile kind of seems like an evil character in every movie.






Edit: Thank you for all the likes! With my new fame I am going to be a sell out (I feel bad about doing this so you don’t have to read it), but I have been editing every one of my latest Fortnite videos for over FIVE HOURS EACH (they are like Ceeday’s videos), but they only get around 20 views (making me extremely depressed), so I would feel very appreciated if you guys went and checked out my latest videos, and you may even like them! Sorry once again for doing this….
So you don't believe that the corporations building wind turbines and solar panels 
have their very own agendas to scare the crap out of us with all these horror stories
about releasing CO2? It's not 100% fake news but there's a healthy serving of 
project fear included allowing corporations to pick our pockets
 whichever kind of energy we choose to use! 
LETS GO NUCLEAR!
Thank You!
I love your science videos!! They make so much sense!!
Thank you for keep trying to educate people in such a simple manner. Also props for posting links to references about your facts.
Scientists: Fossil Fuels are killing the planet!

Exxon: I'm gonna pretend i didn't see that
Omg where gonna die🤣🤣🤣✌
The world as we know it could potentially be over in only a century.. This just made me feel like my life is pointless....
I thought this was going to go one way, but it went the total other way and I'm much happier because of it
I live in equator line and there's only one place where the snow falls, at the top of the highest mountain in my country. People call it 'the eternal' snow. But researchers went to the conclusion that the eternal snow will be completely gone in the year 2025 because of global warming.
Not a fan of the constant cut-backs to the host talking. 
I prefer the old style of whiteboard followed by the host at the end. 
Just making my preference known. If you like it, good on ya!
I long for the day our extinction comes
The earths temperature is always changing, and CO2's effect on it is very small. It's better to focus on reducing plastic waste and finding a more sustainable energy source not based on fossile fuels that will eventually deplete.
“To you, to me and to your mom” ❤️
If global warming isn’t real, why did club penguin shut down?
I think the major opposition to global warming is because the liberals support it (mostly) and by principle the conservatives have to oppose everything the other team supports. It's like a debate competition. It doesn't matter whether you believe in something. You have oppose it just because the other side supports it.
At the moment, several companies are making huge amounts of money from "global warming" - money which governments take from people and give to the companies. Just consider that.
OH NO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING, ten years later, no one has done anything
If our environment gets oofed, Elon-chan is gonna send us to Mars so I'm not too concerned.
Oh dear. For anyone chancing upon this and thinking that all is lost - it's not. Let me assure you that most people - in spite of the views of this upload - are sane, normal rational thinking individuals and not a bunch of indoctrinated, apocalypticist teens.

The trouble with these irritating, childish little pipsqueak clips are often from brainwashed millennials who - along with all the other little girls and boys who skipped double maths to congregate in advocacy for tyrannical global policies - have been duped into third-world-crushing proselytism for a global carbon price floor, mistaking it for saving the planet. The irony, unfortunately, is lost on them.

These children are sadly parroting a dogma in support of the postmodern coup that is engulfing science generally, but more worryingly, climate science. They are the latest product of an educational system that has targeted our sons and daughters to become neo-Lysenkoist, doomsday cultist, marching-in-lockstep (or is that goose step?) mouthpieces for government misinformation that would have us all believe we're heading to hell in a super-heated hand-basket unless we part with our cash now and enact ruinous policies for decades into the future. Witness the green new deal manifesto of AOC: Utterly wealth-destroying, Marxist policies that will further impoverish the already impoverished and punishingly so.

But finally back to those chancer's that made it this far in the comments. Take care, and don't panic. The world is not coming to an end and there are still plenty of us that know it. You are not alone in thinking this, it's just that those that say it are hidden from your view... But that's another story.
Spread this like wildfire
Freak  look like it sound like it you freak a creepy one at that
This needs more visibility
#exxonknew
People been making climate change predictions since 1894. In the 1970s we were told Global Cooling was the thing. In fact, their is a Time magazine with it on the cover, so I don’t know what this oil companies created this crap is.
our generation 2000’s wasn’t lied to 🤫 we are the only hope
Yes. We want our wage slave masters to have a nice climate for their progeny.
Whatever happened to that massive hole in the ozone layer? Is it still there or did it fill in?
But how can climate change be real when its freezing in the Northwest? What do you mean?




I'm obviously joking
Why focus on a fractious issue like climate change when we can just focus on reducing pollution?
Oil companies didn't discover climate change.  The theory of anthropogenic global warming was first proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.
Can you guys make a video about daydreaming. Since its such a weird state of being, cuz why would it be nescesarry to do so??.. it wouldnt add on to the  survival aspect of humans or does it? I just got a lot of questions about this strange mental occurance
Yep I will stay in my denial. Please let me know when Florida has no more beaches and after 40 years of the oceans rising.
We should hold the biggest protest in the United States over climate change.
OMG  they can lie to you and me !! BUT NOT MY MOM !!
Well I only see the weather crazier and crazier.
U could talk about the water shortage. Capetown being the first major city to almost run  outta water. N how usa will run out if water in 40 yrs if we dont slow down... wheres the awareness of this?.... give me a shout out if you do this video 😁
but the idea was developed mid 60's by the think tank...the club of rome....they stated world govt was needed to avoid nuclear war because we a re like quarelling sibblings....nationa that is....so they decided that a existential threat was needed to take sovereignty away from the nations....if this did not succeed they considered a false alien invasion...i read stan deyos book in 1978 where this information was available long before global warming....so  club of rome...exxon...scientist...lie.....just looked at your channel...you are a agent...you are in league
This makes me so anxious :(
Well...
Crap.
The CEO’s of the big oil company’s  should be trialed for mass murder
Science means a great deal to me
Climate change is the biggest hoax in history  !
so many assumptions made
thank you so so so so SO much for making this video
Could you guys tell me how drinking water with gum makes my mouth 1000  times colder?!??
2.9k petrol company owners disliked the video
What about animal agriculture ?
Oh the evil oil companies. This is no other than a conspiracy theory. And what does it offer? The answer is the communist world empire?
In the case of a lake, the locals began to worry that the lake would dry up. The authority was forced to make up for the water. The only problem was that there was little water replacement compared to the lake. The locals didn't know this, the engineers knew the water shortage was temporary. After the first major rain, there was no problem with water shortages.
I'll add it to you fifteen years ago when I talked to a meteorologist. When I said the serious problem of global warming, he laughed at me.
When I first looked more seriously, I laughed. Now I know what political forces are behind global warming, I'm not laughing anymore.
By the way, the Communist parties invented "whispering propaganda". Parts of it include: Enemy Image Making, Pseudoscience Reference, NGO Agent Network.
people say that what we learn in school is useless we shouldn't learn science as it never comes into effect in our lives.


well america, when you don't teach it properly, instead forcing information temporarily  for your standardised tests, you get idiots that can vote who deny climate change, believe the Earth is flat, and that vaccinations are harmful.
why does nobody mention that this video makes the mistake of conflating climate change with man-made global warming? most right wingers agree the climate is in a warming cycle. they simply deny that the current cycle is primarily due to human influences and they disagree on how catastrophic the damage will be in 20-200 years.
You talk and act like a chick. Couldnt finish watching.
I knew all of this all along. How is this a lie?
I really don't like the new video format
7:00 Although these are facts, they are not necessarily caused by global warming. The "deadliest" heat waves could simply be a result of a larger population.
Climate Change is as real as Jussie Smollett's racial attack
Also,  other reasons for global warming or climate change is  things like our farming practices, deforestation, and the infastruture we build. I am sure their are many more reasons, this is a complex issue and I am happy to see more coverage of it.  I just recently listened to an episode of Joe Rogan's podcast where he spoke with David Wallace-Wells on this issue and it was fascinating a must listen for anyone interested in this topic.
Come for them!!!!
What is all this talk about climate change doing to the public? Well it's planting fear, and with that fear we are giving the government more power because they apparently know what to do to fix the "issue"
I haven't been lied to!

Because I'm not American.
My Mom said Y2K was real too.
THANK YOU
The background song!!!!!!
Why are people left or right handed
Come on Elon!
Usually at this time of the year, summer starts in New Delhi, India...but today, there was a Hail fall! It got me so confused
(If this is dumb no one attack me) so like if we all planted some more uh plants would that help at all cuz maybe they can absorb some of it. obviously not all of it and like as long as we breathe the cycle continues but like we need to plant treesss
the Earth is BURNING ./.. nothing else matters
get ready
climate change needs to be stopped. i am not even joking when i am saying, as a twelve year old child, that i am genuinely terrified for my own future and the future of every other child. WE NEED TO ACT RIGHT NOW. we have 11 YEARS before everything we have done to our climate becomes irreversible. climate change is a serious crisis which needs to be treated like a crisis.
Did anyone noticed there was the map of Kolkata just behind Greg.HOLY COW!!!!

ARE YOU IN INDIA(
I live on a boat and the sea has risen about 6 inches since 2003. I know because I cannot come ashore in the same place at a restaurant as it is underwater all the time. It used to be rare - on a spring tide that it was unusable but now all the time.
Climate change is not real .
Please buy hybrids and EV's 👍
These oil companies shouldn't be sued. Their executives should be tarred and feathered, their wealth stripped, and their complicity in likely dooming all of mankind, along with untold billions of other species, be punished more harshly than anything we've ever done to a group of individuals before. A lawsuit isn't enough. These people have a lot of blood on their hands; they are mass killers, worse than any that have come before, and they need to pay for it.
Why are you blaming Exxon? They invested and formed their own company. If renewable energy is the solution, why don't we see big renewable energy companies (despite being £800 bn industry) like Exxon or Aramco? What's stopping them to give an efficient energy to public at very cheap rate? How's Exxon funding to the govt, going to stop other Pvt companies to make money by selling energy using renewables and become big like Exxon? Even if you shut down Exxon Mobils influence in govt, how are you going influence countries like India, China, Russia which contributes about 44% of CO2 emissions? Do we need cut down trees as tress emit CO2? Maybe the lowT guy in the video who is pretending to be an intelligent can answer these questions.
Life of a rugby player as he start play young till retirement, exercise and injures related to the game having an impact on changes of the body...
I didn't see a single source listed in this video...  as far as I'm concerned you have no idea what you're talking about.  your entire premise is based not on the idea that Exxons scientists were right, but on the idea that they "believed" they were right.  huge difference right there.  if you download the data from NASA, and actually study the science, and do the math, then you'd realize that most of the claims you made in this video are completely unsubstantiated.
99.9% of all scientists are 99.9% sure climate change "could" flatten the planet that they are 100% sure isn't flat.
Thankyou i'll be waiting
Climate is changing but CO2 isn't causing it.
Capitalism at its finest
the first two seconds of the video give me a heart attack, its the same as my ring tone.
I just don't get it why those oil companies want to make such big money. Money isn't everything, the future is.
What about the lie that you're telling? That anyone knows how to actually solve the problem.  At least Exxon noticed the problem and raised their platforms add aroused to just bitching about how someone else should fix it.
Can you please discuss weather or not we have 12 years to save the world from climate change. I’ve heard many people opinions and would love yours!
Global cooling in the 1970's
Best way to fight climate change is to stop or at least ease human procreation. Over time, that would lessen energy demand, less CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere.
Well, this makes me ill.
🌍 Do you believe in Climate Change!? 🌍

Like - Yes

Sueing someone for not telling the results of a study is like sueing a company for not revealing trade secrets
Wow I never thought that asapscience would start top have a liberal bias so sad
At this point the fossil fuel companies must be regulated as much as, if not more than cigarette companies, since both contribute to mass deaths of life on earth (cigarettes on humans, fossil fuels on wildlife and partially [soon fully if ignored and neglected] on humans)
This climatic crisis is because the people for decades bought things that didn't need.
The biggest lie about climate change is that it is caused primarily by fossil fuels. Refrigerants have almost twice the impact, by some accounts.
Keep going with this!!
Why does fighting“Climate change“ have to involve going full on socialist and ultimately communist?! Climate change is being used as an excuse to enslave humanity in a dystopian Orwellian world far worse than the one depicted in the novel 1984! And why is it that these same people also want to import millions of Third World migrants into the western world where their carbon footprint will be increased by 7 to 10 times what it is now?! Just asking.
Can you do an animation on what food poisoning does to your insides? & how it does what it does? I just recently had food poisoning & wow it feels like my stomach turned into a washing machine, washing my organs. it felt terrible
Why can't we strip ExxonMobil as a company and forcefully take back their entire assets and money earned from top execs, to be used for combating climate change? Then leave the top execs in the middle of the hottest desert as well.
/www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/
And we are curious why aliens dont visit us? Is it rly a point? We are morrons... If we dont fix earth, earth will fix us. painfuilly...
You should’ve mentioned the even worse effect of lifestock and their massive methane production
So much bad information being regurgitated by deniers in these comments. We should be troubled by the effectiveness of the propaganda.
While climate change is real, you ignore any positives that came as a result of using fossil fuels like bringing cheap plentiful and reliable energy to billions of people living in poverty.
Guess we’ll have to wait for global cooling again.
Hey guess what ? Melting Arctic sea ice doesn't raise sea level, so you don't have to worry about that. If this moron made it through 5th grade he should know that.
I’m a firm believer in climate change, and global warming. However, I do have a question;

A friend of mine doesn’t believe in it, and think we’re all being fed lies. Anyway, his argument was that back when dinosaurs were around, the CO2 levels were much higher, and that the plant life thrived. That we had bigger, healthier plants— concluding that we aren’t harming the earth. 

I didn’t necessarily have a response, but wonder, how could you argue that? Not because I don’t believe in climate change, but because I’m trying to make him realize that it is in fact real.
Bring back guillotines
As someone living in a country that is currently experiencing the worst drought it has ever gone through with no end in sight, seeing people blatantly dismiss climate change as a hoax is both infuriating and painful. If we don't fix this, many of us will end up dead. This is no longer something we can wave off.
That's ironic. I have to do a page of notes about global warming/climate change for school.
Haha thanks! 👍
This video was uploaded exactly one year after Stephen Hawking died. May he rest in peace.
Please go back to just animation i enjoy geting lost in your videos and watching you jiggle your head e.g 4:10 also please dont zoom into your face
Such a great video
The biggest lie about Climate Change is that the climate models are reliable and accurate. They are pure crap. GIGO. Their results are based on the assumptions built into the models.
1. Science isn’t determined by consensus. It’s determined by fact.
2. Insanely funny that you mentioned the Green New Deal, as it calls for the extinction of “farting cows” and the abolishment of air travel.

Interested to see what “solutions” you propose in the follow up vid, likely more government regulations and measures that won’t help anything at all like getting rid of plastic straws or some such nonsense.
Umm no climate change was not 'discovered' by Exxon scientists. It was know about long before that. You call yourself a science channel? Really?
Academic scientists, many of them also science fiction and science essay authors, suspected this as far back as the 1940s.  Isaac Asimov mentioned it in science fact essays during the 1950s and 1960s, and used a sociopolitical analogy to the climate change problems we face as part of the plot of his novel “The Gods Themselves.”

Also, in one of his mystery stories in the Black Widowers Club series, the answer to the mystery involved a young boy from Quebec, who was a French history fanatic, describing an Exxon station as the sign of the Cross of Lorraine.  This was during the oil crisis of the 1970s, when a common nickname for Exxon was the “sign of the double cross.”

It’s pretty obvious that if we burn carbon faster than the Earth recaptures it, it will accumulate in the upper atmosphere and produce a greenhouse effect.  And we have already burned in the last three centuries an amount of carbon that accumulated over millions of years, and afterward remained sequestered in the Earth for hundreds of millions of years longer.
They should have made it look even worse than it is to cause fear amongst the public. They coulda made bank by making renewable energy using fear to motivate people to buy them
There is no such thing as global warming.

The Earth in all its history has always had changing climate !!!
Way to politicize a science channel. Unsubscribed.
This is actually evil.
Go eat some carbon biache!!
This is actually terrifying
wild how capitalism really do be like that huh
Imagine a world where everyone started listening to science and since there was such a Psychological delay everyone had to dramatically change there lives.

Now imagine 20 years in the future.
I honestly tried to watch the whole thing but the presenter is just too irritating. Great research and facts ruined by narcissistic presentation.
Help I don't know what to believe. Global warming seems to make sense, but how can people be so sure humans are the cause. My only real doubt stems from all of the wrong predictions that have been made since the 70's. I am not a denier, just genuinely confused.
Thumbs up for awesome presentation of important information
Who's striking on the 15th??🙌🙌🙌
That's so depressing :(
And people say that millennials are the worst generation...
We need to listen to the Climate
experts IPCC is full of. They are paid for their peer reviewed calls
for humanity to get rid of CO2 before it gets rid of us. Al Gore got
Nobelled for his doomsday Opus Magnifique that we missed just by the
skin of our teeth this time. CO2 is coming back to bite us where it
hurts, and we must do something to feel better about our looming
fiery demise. Michael E. Mann just missed his Nobel, but two Xerox
copies are adorning his Penn State office to commemorate the
days of his peer reviewed glory. We still have 12 years to mend our
sinful ways of breathing excessively, exhaling CO2 at a mind boggling
40,000 ppm, 100 times higher than the tragic present ambient CO2
412ppm concentration only trees seem to enjoy. Stupid trees do not
understand how dangerous it is for them to grow too fast just
because they like CO2 almost as much as deniers do.
This makes me sad and very angry we have to fix what THEY broke
This is such a great video and released just at the right time! I study CC in university and did not know the history of exxon and lee raymond. Crazy how much they leave out in school.
Why dosent somebody sue dis biss😒
It is not going hotter but it really changed it is may and in my country snow has fallen like wtf  before when is may you go to beaches now you drink tee
Sorry but I was not able to focus on your words because I just came from the Pi song and and the background music is making my brain struggle. I’d have to watch it twice tho
If this is such a big problem invade Brazil and China and make them stop
great video.
what a snowflake.  Look at scientific facts, the earth is 2 degrees cooler than it was 50000 years ago.  They used to grow grapes for wine in London in the middle ages.  How is the planet hotter.  If what you stated about the rising seas is true there will be no human population to worry about.  The planet has been here for billions of years and we make no difference at all.  We affect things in certain ways and should concentrate on reducing pollution (plastics)  all this electric solar power needs fossil fuels for manufacturing.
Are there still people who actually think climate change myth is real??  Pull  your heads out of the sand.  This a truckload of lies and total b.s.  Our time should be spent on worthwhile causes.  BTW Algore believes it because he was able to scan people for gobs and gobs of money.
Hey asap if you really want some facts not emotions go watch louder with crowder 5 climate change myths  debunked
Hey don't believe the oil companies, look at the UN IPCC reports. The experts are scrambling to explain the pause in temperature rise while CO2 continues to rise. In fact, the last three years the global temperature has actually decreased.  Climate experts cannot explain what they call "the pause" which is really a decline. Now a number of scientists are coming to believe that rising temperatures have more to do with solar variance and water vapor than CO2.  Since temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere are rising while temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere are falling, another hypothesis is simply population increases and urbanization.  When high density concrete laden cities (heat sinks) are eliminated from temperature data, the increase in temperature is actually much smaller and well within the range of error. Science is never final, my friend, so when someone says debate is over, it is settled, run the other way, you are not talking to a real scientist. Oh don't believe me either, a good graph of global temperature change is being maintained by Phd Roy Spencer and can be found here:   You will see that current 10 year averages for temperatures are about .35 degrees C above what they were in 1981. Hardly the runaway heating that was predicted! Oh one other thing, the UN IPPC report states that climate models should not be used to predict future global temperatures. Well if we can't predict, then we can't know the danger, and we should not destroy the entire economic systems of the world to try to fix it.  I'll take observable, measurable, empirical data over computer models any day.
Share this with everywhere
As a civil engineer this is an issue we are dealing with. However, it is not such a pressing matter.
Well thanks to exxon, we are all actually going to die. It’s too late to reverse whatever that’s alr been done. That amount of co2 in the air will carry on warming the world and the side effects it will bring. Even if we were to have 0 emission right before 2030, 1-2 c will still happen and we have all already had a face on experience with how much damage an increase of 1c has already done around the world. You can carry on going on climate strikes skipping schools, but unless you actually destroy capitalism as a whole at this point of time, there’s no way. Would all the firms that has heavily polluted the world be interested in going clean energy and having their profit be gone? I doubt that. Let’s not forget the amount of baby boomers who are rich and powerful don’t  give two fucks about us. Since they wouldn’t be alive to face the magnitude of the collapse that will eventually occur.
The biggest lie about climate change is that the world would end. The world will survive, just not us.
Talk about the grand solar minimum
Turtle "Me and my buddy flamingo just heard that Exxon have lied to the rest of humanity and put us all in danger. Elephant "And apparantly humans are supposed to be the most intelligent and advanced species , you don't see no tigers denying climate change, also they are going extinct so even if tigers spoke, there will only be a few of them left, so..."
whoa slow down.  6:27 "carbon released combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to create CO2".  NO!  the CO2 is released as CO2 it doesnt need to combine with the oxygen in the atmosphere!  Its released as CO2 as a product of combustion.
Solar panels are good
Not true.  The biggest lie is actually climate change itself.  This video is garbage.
So stop using fossil fuels, and get back at the big oil companies, stop driving, stop flying.
People, do not worry about the planet called earth because it is going the way the Lord has determined it to go and no man can change God's Holy Word!!!! The world is destined to burn and be destroyed, the world was destroyed by a flood the first time, the second is by fire. God, I believe is allowing these disasters to come about as merciful warnings to His creation to warn them to prepare to meet thy God Amos 4:12. And is far as man thinking they are going to live on other planets they are wasting their time and billions upon billions and billions of tax payer's dollars, for no-one and that means absolutely no-one is going to escape the wrath of God unless they are washed in the precious blood of the precious Lamb of God , our Lord Jesus Christ who was slain before the foundations of the world. People do not worry about saving the planet!!!!!!! worry about asking the Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of the One true living God to save your soul, the world will pass away and all the things therein but the Word of our living God will never pass away.Glenn Johnson
Exaggerating the threat of climate change makes people think the threat of climate change has been exaggerated. Who would have guessed?? Should we stop exaggerating and start delivering the science? Nah, let's keep exaggerating, but let's also bash those who mention it. That'll  surely work! Right??

There are liars on both sides. What else is new, it's politics after all.
How to stop climate
If we look at other data, it is still highly possible it is the SUN and cosmic rays. We actually have more trouble in our hands with pollution, that is the biggest short sighted thing, we left over looking pollution on our planet for years, action on pollution is way more important than so called climate change.
I learned it in 5th class, now I am in 11th class , live in india
Why are you guys so dang happy all the time?
The world is not warming in any significant way.  The tiny bit of warming, if any, would be great.  I wish the planet would warm even more.  When I was a kid the kooky environmentalists and our kooky liberal teachers scared the shiz out of us with global cooling, ozone depletion, and acid rain.  Now it's global warming.  I will never trust environmental science again.
Man made global warming is nothing more than propaganda with no scientific evidence. People have being mass brain washed into believing that man made global warming is real.


Tell a lie enough times and people will start to believe it. (Quote by Hitler) What they say about Co2 is complete rubish, all animals and plants release co2. 


If that's the case just kill a few million people, it should help with global warming.
Exxon to scientists:   Who hired you anyways ..
So all this time I've been debating with exxon employees... Such a waste of time
The Sun transmits at an effective temperature of approximately 5800 K, with an emission spectrum, peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the visible spectrum.  Entering Earth's atmosphere, about 55% of the incoming sunlight is infrared photons. They strike the Earth and are reradiated back out into the atmosphere in the black body temperature range of 255K. The other 45% is white light and of that, about 30% of that is reflected back into outer space, which is what you would see from outer space looking back at the Earth. That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated back into the atmosphere as infrared photons. That would mean 55% infrared photons coming in and 86.5% total infrared photons going out. As we increase secondary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,  we block more incoming infrared photons, slightly cooling off the planet.  Being there are more outgoing infrared photons than incoming, we should trap more outgoing infrared photons than reflect incoming photons. That being said, all things being equal, the planet must heat.
the great white con.info
climate change is not just caused by the burning of coal, gas and oil.
animal agriculture is another big one - if not the biggest contributor of them all.
this is because animal agriculture does not just contribute with methane emissions that are 25 - 100 times more potent than CO2, but also in the destruction of our planets carbon sinks.
it is the leading cause of deforestation, ocean dead zones, desertification, water pollution and habitat destruction.
when it comes to loss of bio diversity, mass animal agriculture and the vast mono-cultures required to run it is without a doubt the one main cause.
any video about climate change that does not even mention animal agriculture is lacking research.
we should sue exxonmobil for threatening our futures, and force them to pay for the damages done by climate change
Climate change is a fact  global warming and cooling happens, the weather system is extremely complex, we can not change the weather not matter how much much we tax and spent on it.
We can adapt, preserve and conserve. What the Sun does in the future is out of our control, Sun Tax will not work nor will a Water Vapor Tax be achievable. However call carbon dioxide a poison caused by humans then you can impose a Carbon Tax and make the Greens happy while the Earth either gets hotter or colder depending on the Sun and water vapor (clouds). At least we can smugly say we did our best spent trillions to solve a natural event. Future generations will laugh how we wasted money in a complicated way and solved nothing.
I thought the worst lie is that nuclear energy is dangerous.
Like it is the miracle that we can use to end our dependence on fossil fuels.
The second worst lie is that its a crisis vs  just a problem.
the governments and companies such as big pharma and cellphone companies AND Bill Gates at the helm aim to wipe human and animal life off the planet by 2050 through chemtrailing, GMO s and 5G and vaccines too. And why? Because they'll make a shedload of money in the process. 🤬
This is exactly my point of view. Trump also says global warming is a hoax not because he disbelieves it but to let these big companies keep using fossil fuels and not do research on alternative source of energy. So companies like Tesla, who focus on green energy should be promoted instead. Just look at how other automobile companies are investing in green energy knowing Tesla is their competition, pretending as if clean energy was their first priority from the beginning.
2 coldest years in a row, faked data, no sea level rise as predicted, no temp rise as predicted, no increased drought, flood, or other weather as predicted, everything agw predicted is WRONG, but you still see this crap pushed in 2019.... Wtf when will people wake up and realize they were duped, another 10 years? Its been over 30 and doomsday still hasn't come yet, and they said it'd be here TODAY. Pretty nice outside actually ;-D

This isn't science or history its crappy propaganda against oil companies / republicans edited in such a way to make them look bad. Every scientist knows agw has HUGE uncertainties and we are still unsure it is even happening since we can't really measure it, and there are MAJOR problems with the hypothesis. There is no consensus despite what leftist media lies to you about.. 

That is all those memos and documents emphasize, the FACT of uncertainty in the system and we can't measure it, there is too much variation and background noise, and also again, major problems with the physics behind CO2 based warming... 

Leftists, enviro nuts, and activists don't want to look at these problems and ignore them, because if they did their whole basis for demonizing CO2 would fall apart, and they could no longer push their REAL agenda - so called green based alternatives to oil that don't really work, ie. the companies lobbying and funding the so called "green" industry.
The US is so corrupt it's actually scaring me.
Those capitalists pigs
Its just sad to see people agreeing to someone like this just take a look at the last 10 seconds of the video and realise who you are agreeing with... smh
The way I see it saving the planet at this point is as likely as an autistic person getting a job.
Leonardo decaprio has left the chat
Corporations are evil
Man I don't want believe it but I think global warming is the human's Great Filter. And it's not looking like we're going to get through it.
Small things adds up to big results.
We should do somethings locally around our house, cities & state to make a difference.
Plant trees, improve water table, remove pollutants from living space, decrease your carbon footprint.
We should work collectively as a human being to tackle this situation.
I love how this video makes it look like there's only money to be made by denying global warmth. The fear of global warmth is the same as fear of criminality. One sells security solutions, the other one sells environment solutions. Take a look at how refrigerators were made 30-40 years ago, and take a look at how they're made now. Hint: there's a much bigger chance your grandma's fridge from when your parents weren't born yet is still there, but the one your parents bought, the one you bought not so long ago might have been replaced.
Im not saying emissions are not a huge problem....but did that make the North pole recently leave the Arctic? There is a bit more at play here than just the dino bones and people should acknowledge that also. The problem with saying "Its this and ONLY this" is a shortsighted view that will lead to serious problems down the track. Why can't it be a combination of factors?
2:30 you’re forgetting that just a few years earlier in the 70’s, Time magazine said we were about to go into an ice age
This video did nothing to support the global warming claim.  I'm one of those few individuals that wants to see evidence.  I have no doubt burning fossil fuel adds heat to our world.  The question is... is it the cause of significant warming?  Then; is warming a bad thing or does it bring a balance of good and bad and is there more bad than good?
Is he and the other guy (a) couple/husbands?
Who needs a car when you can have a boat?
If it was not for companies,
This woulden't be a political issue
Come to Delhi , India and stay here for only 2 days you will notice what is real heat 😅😅
Reprobate.
If you are still searching for a subject for a song, I have one: all the different things that our body produces.
This is in the forefront of my mind daily. Thanks, Science.
I think this is factually incorrect. It was Dr Roger Revelle, back in the 50s, who first proposed anthropogenic climate change - an idea taken up with great enthusiasm by his D-grade student Al Gore.
Here's a question: Is the fact the sun is continuing to change more hydrogen into helium also causing the sun to burn hotter as well as it loses mass?
Galileo was a denier as were the people who denied the divinity of whichever  great leader. Deniers are in very prestigious company. I note the warming prediction these exon scientist made turned out to be highly  inaccurate. The models used by the  intergovernmental panel on climate change predicted temperatures would rapidly rise between the years 1998 and 2013. when in fact they hardly rise at all. When the results don't match the predictions based on your hypothesis your hypothesis is clearly wrong.
Oh, hopefully you don't exhale CO2 - otherwise, you'd be further "polluting" the earth.  Let's just get rid of all CO2, that way all life dies on earth and earth would be this spinning utopia of rock.
So, a couple things.  1, science isn't a consensus.  If 100 mathematicians say 2 cubed is 6 but one says it's 8, does the consensus mean that math is wrong?  Obviously not.  2, the climate is always changing.  Like since the beginning of time.  And if human actions effect it, then so does literally everything else.  The act of being on the planet means you're effecting the climate.  3, even if the US went 100% carbon negative, we still would not be able to stop the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.  4, the greenhouse effect that has been calculated is rumored to have been arrived at using flat Earth physics and grossly overestimates the effect on the atmosphere.  5, the majority of the weather and the climate is determined by the interaction between the two most abundant fluids on the planet: water and air.  Trying to predict the results of that is like trying to balance a pencil on it's tip.  And lastly, the very people who are dedicated to observing and predicting the weather (it's kinda like a climate slice) can't even get their predictions right a week in advance or even get it near correct with live data!  Add that on top of the fact that every (literally every single one!) climate disaster prediction has not only been markedly false, but nowhere near accurate.  I've been fed the lie of climate doom since the day I was born.  Now, 30 years later, I can see that on the grander scale NOTHING HAS CHANGED!

If you must insist that the "science is settled", you have to come to one of two conclusions:
1, these scientists don't actually know what they are doing and have been feeding everyone lies for 4 decades.
Or 2, these scientists know EXACTLY what is going on and refuse to tell everyone.
CNN The Walls Are Closing In, Russia, Russia, Russia, Collusion, Collusion, Collusion, CNN We Are In Impeachment Territory, Eh More Fake Stuff............

‼️
My boyfriend still thinks it’s a lie. He says there’s so many videos out there showing the data of how the world has grown glaciers and is fluctuating temp and has been for years. He says that co2 is what plants eat and Blah blah blah. Please find those videos and debunk them or I’m afraid people like my boyfriend (extreme) conservatives will forever think it’s a lie. XoXo
Remember this all started cause of greed
ANIMAL AGRICULTURE is the leading cause of climate change, desertification, land use, deforestation, fish exploitation, starvation, and species extinction. Live stock covers 45% of the world’s land and only 2% of wildlife left on earth. 91% of destruction in the Amazon rainforest is due to animal agriculture. Every second 1 acre of rainforest the size of a football field is cleared for animal agriculture. The amazon rainforest is the lungs of this earth. Domestic use of water in the US only makes up 5% while animal agriculture uses 55% of USA water. The meat & dairy industry uses 1/3 of earth fresh water. 1 hamburger is equivalent to 3000 liters of water which is then equal to  2 months worth of showers due to the water footprint of processed food. 1/3 of land is decertified due to livestock. 80.4 MILLION metric tons of fish are pulled from oceans each year. 3/4 of world’s fisheries are exploited. For every 1 kilogram of fish caught, there are 5 kilograms of unintended marine species are caught and classified as by-kill. Waste from 2500 dairy cows is equivalent to the waste from a city of 411,000 people. 80% of antibiotics in the US goes to animal agriculture. It is also said that in areas of poverty and starvation their land is being used for livestock to feed westernized countries.ANIMAL AGRICULTURE is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction. SUGAR is also the leading cause of obesity, all diabetes, and heart disease. Everyday each person is only to consume 25g of sugar per day and by the looks of it we exceed that number by a lot. Americans treat breakfast like dessert. Sugar is in everything you eat, take a minute to look at the nutrition facts on the back of the packaging. Free chocolate milks given by public school systems for breakfast and lunch of students contain the same amount of sugar as a can of coke. 1 out of every 3 people is either obese or morbidly obese. The population is said only to grow with more than 200,000 people born per day. Many mouths to feed. Yearly us humans consume 21 billion pounds of food and 5.2 billion gallons of water. While cattle consumes 135 billion pounds of food and consumes 45 billion gallons. Due to the PATRIOT act in the law we should not blame this on our government. Rather than come together for a solution. The solution is simple, and that is to create healthier lifestyle choices specifically diet and exercise. You can help save our world by becoming vegan. On a vegan diet you save 1100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq.ft forest, 10 pounds of CO2, and 1 animals life PER DAY. A little bit of sacrifice for the sake of humanity will be greatly rewarded in the future. It is up to you to make a conscious decision to make an impact in this world.
More Republicans/Conservatives need to see this video.
The climate has changed for billions of years of years. Why do we think that suddenly we have had such a drastic impact when the industrial revolution has only occurred for less than 150 years?
methane gas is the biggest killer of the planet which comes from animal agriculture especially cows GO VEGAN
Denying or refusing to acknowledge the reality of climate change only makes you a useful idiot for the energy sector’s prerogatives. I’ll never understand why people research pseudoscience that reaffirms their opinions rather than trying to educate themselves on the issue. That should come naturally to any reasonable person.
You lie to my mum you dead!
Remember when republicans weren't total pieces of garbage? I don't. My first republican president was bush jr.
I think the biggest lie is assuming taxing the average tax payer is going to solve or help climate change. US only produces 13% OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS and has been declining for decades.
Why do you care you and everybody on the earth will die eventually
buy pop filter
Please allow us to translate the subtitles!! I want to share this video so badly on my facebook, but not everyone can understand English! I've translated them a few weeks ago but they still don't appear :(
Can't wait for the second part, love u!
The problem is that we are so dependant on fossil fuels, nuclear and geo thermal energy are actually capable of sustaining the US unlike wind and solar. A slow gradual switch from fossil fuels to nuclear and geothermal is the way to go instead of radically reducing CO2 consumption and destroying the economy.
Tell me if you feel so right why with the smug, closed eyes while talking, attitude?
Thank you so much for explaining this with solid evidence to back it up. Anyone who isn't concerned about climate change is shortsighted or kidding themselves.
We do not live in a fish tank guys... This whole video is based on the out of date Newtonian idea of cause and effect. Its wrong... Wake up people. The universe or planet is NOT how you think it is.
If global warming is real, why is it cold outside where I live right now?
Checkmate
LMAO
Nuclear industry lobbied hard. 

How does giving the U.N. 100bn a year help?
I am not doubting climate change but when scientists say that only 18% of the total amount of the Sun's output that reaches the Earth touches the surface. Then what does the other 82% do to the climate? The Earth's magnetic field is weakening 5% a decade now verses 5% a century. With the protective field weakening and at some point poles flipping I am more worried about plastics in our oceans then I am about climate change as there is not much I can do about it but adapt. On a side note climate is changing for other planets in our solar system.
Of course its real idiot. It's been changing for all time. But it's not man that's causing it. Qhat caused it to change during the ice change.
Only 643 dislikes compared to 13K likes. I'm a little surprised, people are actually believing the truth after nearly five decades. Hopefully this will soon no longer be a left or right issue. How heartening!
Omg I’m so scared for the future
Climate change is a real problem and if you don't think it is then your just being ignorant, but the green new deal is NOT the way to fix it
My mom hates lying
Of course climate change is real. However we live in a world of 71/2 billion people going up to 9-10 billion by 2050. All of which will demand more energy for a higher standard of living. But energy also must be predictable, reliable, and as concentrated as possible. This is where renewable fail. While renewables will make a significant contribution to our energy mix and help lift the worlds poorest living in remote areas out of abject poverty they can't power an advanced industrial civilization with that many people. Nuclear energy has the potential to power our industrial civilization without any carbon emissions. I would argue it can become the most environmentally friendly, safest, and cheapest source of electricity. But we aren't there yet and won't be for a while. So for now we are stuck with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are also particularly well suited for many applications such as aviation, heavy construction and farm machinery,  and transportation in general. So where does that leave us? Basically with acceptance of climate change, and the need for mitigation and remediation of the damage that will be caused by the rise in temperatures. Climate change is here and growing, accept it, we can't reverse it, and probably not even slow it significantly. Were fooling ourselves to think so.
The biggest lie about climate change is that it's killing the planet. 
For the record, the planet is fine, it's been through worse. 
It's all life that's used to the way things are who are getting screwed (including humans).
If we make space ships to leave earth, these guys aren't invited
I hate his voice
Wow this sucks for use little ones who have to live with this
5 minutes in... that's all I can take. How many lies and mistakes was that ? My eyes are blurry but that looks like 9 lies in 5 minutes to me. Later !
No one lies to my mama
This video is incredibly misleading. The leasing cause of global warming is animal agriculture. ASAP Science is a joke.
Ahahah this video is a joke. Global warming is a hoax we all know it. I had to shut it when you said: "they built  the platforms higher in contrast to their predictions in Ocean rise''. Are you aware of the fact that ocean have risen only 20cm in the last 100 years. What sea levels are you talking about? Their is no scientist on the matter that agrees with these stupid allegations that CO2, the molecule necessary for plants to survive, some how makes the temperature rise. There is no correlation between them you can see that on graphs on a scale of thousands of years. I m a chemist
So full of it.
Please have information on the green new deal! I’m very interested and would love to hear your take on it
How can I help?
i wanted to like this but your narration is too animated
exxon didn't discover climate change, the 1st person to propose burning fossil fuels would increase the temperature was svante arrhenius (the pH guy) in 1890's i think.
here come the triggered cuckservatives
Thought this video was going to be about 2004 when Al Gore said all polar ice would be gone by 2013. Or 2010 when NASA said all polar ice would be melted by 2018.
Hypothetically if you were a scientist and discovered iron clad proof that climate change is a hoax but in revealing it you would be financially destroyed and ruined in every way would you reveal it? By not revealing it you would be given massive grants and made financially secure for life why would you say anything but climate change is real?
I agree with most of what have been said but the mention of the green  deal was pointless since the green deal is actual garbage
And now Trump's new budget proposal has even less money being budgeted for the Environmental Protection Agency.....
Getting my toes wet in the science behind predicting warming, it’s bloody complicated. It’s rough how oversimplified people make it and how everyone’s so confident one way or another without understanding any of it.
But how
I haven't bought Exxon oil since the Exxon Valdez shitted in the Puget sound.  It wasn't hard at all, it was never a sacrifice.  If most Americans would do this pithy level of consumer discretion we could literally change the world and rid it of 90% of corporate evil.
Hahaha
Despite this, people will still not do their part to reduce there carbon emissions. 
Brb as Im planning to buy a car tomorrow (after having took public transportation for 1.5 years)
Um your trying to prove global warming as heat only thing, the lately warm and strange weather is because of solar warming. But you fully aware the on average the temperature has been droping or equalling from 2014 we are due a cold drop from the sola spots going meaning your 2050 prodiction is already debunked by facts that temperatures in the world colder already hence the deserts with snow. Gobal warming is a thing but more how much we making toxic for the planet not really anything that large to change the weather we not even a tier 1 civilisation we dont have that much power to control are planets weather yet.
They been pushing this bullcrap propaganda for 50 years, its a trick.
Climates change, but studies show that it is just part of the earth’s cycles.
I like this style of video. Please do more mini docs.
Propaganda...sigh
Oh no, they used the word "debate", when we all know "the debate is over" because they said so. I better believe what they say because the government is never wrong ( like invading a country over weapons of mass destruction that don't exist ) and they never screw us over for money ( like the bank bailout ) so let's all be good little sheep and allow them to tax the air we breathe now.
Hippie
Well I was hopeful for this but it is straight one sided propaganda.
Daily existential dread quota: reached
how will big germent help it wont it will a huge tax on every one.
This is why people should just do the right thing
How can climate change be real if the earth is donut shaped.
Ok time to wake up. Firstly do some of your own research instead of viewing biased leftism videos. Are we all that gullable that we think this video is real. It took a 42 percent increase of co2 in the last century to raise the global temperature by .8 Celsius. Now if you take our current situation we doubled the co2 ppm in this century.  From 185 ppm to now 400ppm. This promotes plant growth just as the one you by to use in green houses. Google it, co2 generators. Most plants thrive in 1500ppm of co2 and in  exchange provide oxygen. If this is not convincing do your own real unbiased research. So co2 is not the real problem it could be as simple as natural events on earth. Last one was 800,000 years ago. So now if you think about it this is a perfect reason for our governments to cash grab on this lie.
Those guys are sure going to hell, can we not sue them?
First one to comment
They been pushing this bullcrap propaganda for 50 years, its a trick.
The earth goes through cycles of heating and cooling anyone remember the ice age?
What the industry can change is local climate change, not a global scale climate change... the CO2 level of one single eruption of a vulcano is equivalent a years of CO2 made by the industry... yet we had multiples eruptions throughout history and the world is still shinning. Why don't you talk about the CLIMATEGATE? The "World scientific consensus report of global warming" full of fake and twisted data exposed by one of the scientists
What a a clever video. Looks like it's about to tell the truth, but falls back into the lie. New York Times: ....Many years ago, highlighted 100's of leaked emails confirming that "climate scientists" have been falsifying data for decades. Still on going. Out kids are the future? All our kids have been indoctrinated with LIES. 1000's of scientists not being listened to ... find them on the internet. And just in case you're a hard core tree hugger, yes, some of them work at NASA and most have PHD's u can only dream of.
Good to know we're gonna be killed due to corporate greed.
"you were lied to" 
laughs in European
This scares me
This channel is fake.
Ok lets get this straight. Climate change is something that happens naturally in an ecosystem as large as own. Throughout the many million of years prior to us humans being on this planet, there have been major fluctuations in temperature and C02 levels in the atmosphere that this "climate change" debate can be deemed as completely down to the long term natural variations in the earth's climate. In the age of the dinosaurs, they were able to exist due to the much higher C02 levels. The mega flora was able to exist due to these high C02 levels. Change in climate is completely down to how the earth changes in its position around the sun and on its axis. With the attention on melting ice caps, it has been proven that the water re-freezes on the opposite side of the globe where it is colder. The variations in temperature are down to less than a degree which is once again completely down to the natural variation in our earth's climate. On studies of some mountains that are near the area in which I live, over the past decade or so the levels of snow have been gradually rising each winter. Record cold temperatures are indeed being reached, it is just covered up by those who are so set on climate change being the "impending doom of humanity". In the past the planet has had many ice ages as many are aware of. These ice ages at some point melt with the gradual re heating of the earths atmosphere. Atmospheric change is something that has happened in the past and is now happening again. Everyone who wants to bang on about how we are destroying the planet needs to stop for a second and actually take the time to educate themselves on how it is normal for an environment as complex and diverse as our own, there will be change in its characteristics over long periods of time. Give it a few hundred years and we will be seeing ourselves in a global cooling period and the process will repeat itself. I do enjoy the videos you make, however I do believe your view on climate change is bias and you are not open to look at the natural explanations for the change in our climate.
Load of crap
And this is only about the fossil fuels. Our livestock is a much bigger problem for the global heating issue
To those that say that climate change isn't real and that the striking youths (me being one of them) should be at school, I tell you this. Is it so wrong that people  want to live greener? If climate change isn't real, the destruction done to the planet still exists, extinctions, microplastic damage, etc, what is so wrong about wanting to look after the planet anyways, regardless of climate change? Regardless of whether it's true or not? I ask you, what is wrong with wanting to respect our home?
Wow your videos are so 
educational 😁 they’re are really helping me understand science
It's not our fault, it's not that bad, there's nothing we can about it. Wind farms are inefective and hurt the environment more than help. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are good for the environment. That's why they pump it into actual greenhouses to help the plants grow faster and healthier. There is data and science backing all of this up 100%. Go look for it because everyone is full of shit and will never show you.
No global warming people, no climate change either its called seasons... no change in sea levels or global temp change.. it’s only gone up .9 of a degree Fahrenheit in the past 100 years... investigate for your self please..
Good channel
Scientist: shows results*
Exxon: ignores*
World: dies*
Sure, it's all true but you're preaching to the choir. I think it's something like 90% of fox viewers are over the age of 68 and these people vote. You're not going to get through to them. We might be better off hoarding our knowledge in a safe place and just allowing the culling to begin. Maybe create some floating structures to prevent small island genocide. Give it a century and let malaria do its thing. The quicker it happens the quicker we'll come out of it with a greatly reduced population. Giant swathes of newly-produced fertile land. While maintaining and even advancing our level of Technology. Should we really have 7, 8 or 9 billion people on this planet? Do you look forward to having a diet of algae and insects? Too many people. This is a finite system. We might be able to mine an asteroid for ore but you can't grow corn on an industrial level  space. Or can we?
Anthropogenic climate change is a hoax, its for more control over us and more money grabbing, There is no consensus on anthropogenic climate change even if there was (which it ISN’T) doesn’t make it a fact because science is not based on consensus.
Hahahaha, O-okay did anyone ever think that  there are just too many people on earth, with all the meds and  Vaccinations to many people that are surviving natural selection or evolution. There needs to be population control, like all the  Diseases and natural illnesses that use to keep people in check. Just something to think about along with the fact that climates change every few hundred years. I swear it seems people are getting more gullible to "manbearpig" theories.
This is a lie, if he is saying the scientist thought this, they were incorrect, the sea levels haven’t risen since this time and the Arctic ice is not melted at nor is it going to be, populations of polar bears are larger than ever despite what you might hear the mainstream media.
HaHa This IS ALL a crock of crap. Not going to explain it to people that are ignorant and believe whatever they are told. Bottom line is that the climate always changes.  This just a bunch of B.S. to put money in the "scientists" and democratic politicians  pocket and is used to get votes by trying to scare everyone.
James Hansen.
What? Extinction  is no big thing.....they just want to be the richest as they die with the rest of us.
Please explain me how can a oil company promote or say global warming is true . It may end up their business . I still don't understand this irony . Please explain me .
This is the first time in history that this degree of warming has taken only slightly more than a hundred years. Down from 10-20,000 years, pre-industry. All the greenhouse gasses have actually turned what was a cooling cycle into a warming cycle. We're in both at the same time, between the Earth's orbit and the pollutants, but the pollutants are winning the race!
😁
To Hell with governments and companies, if we as people do nothing, nothing will change
good needed video
LOL, plants grow better with higher CO2. Stop trying to starve plants! 😠
do they not realise that if they’re dead money won’t matter??
You lies
The hole in the ozone layer has nearly closed. It just seems odd nobody is interested in talking about that when it's a clear example of humans making positive change. Maybe when the Leftists get the "right president" they'll go off climate change and calling everyone a racist onto some other collectivism trend.
Climate science dates back to the early 1900's though
Whether it's change caused by humans or a natural change or a natural change going the wrong direction caused by humans, the Earth is going to change whether humanity likes it or not.


But there methods to live. Only if people and countries are willing.
WOW.
Of course people want to deny climate change. we as a population don’t want to blame ourself for this. It’s sad, but true.
Yeah sorry .. no love for oil companies but its not CO2 and never was.

Over a dozen sets of data on this now and I've stated for years what's happening cannot be stopped .. in fact its several hundred thousand years .. LATE.

Tried to tell narrow minded hate filled people with tunnel vision this for years.

I've now written over a twenty articles on this .. catching people with an agenda doesn't make the opposing argument correct.

Facts are facts .. things looking like they are linked just appear to be linked and not fact. Some seem to think that repeating narratives makes it fact eventually too.

The obvious reality to me will be impossible to refute in 12 to 24 months I can assure everyone of that.
The best way is to save money and reuse plastics as much as possible.
The free market gave us innovations in car engine technology and created a whole new segment known as "sub compact" vehicles.

We have the power by demanding more efficient products.
we don't need another debate between believers and deniers. we don't need to be told the usual BS Propaganda from both sides. what we need ist a real objective Science Documentation where they show how those Climate Models are developed so we can finally see the evidence and understand the data ourselfs.
I shouldn't have watched this, this is so depressing, ignorance truly was bliss lmao
The reason that climate change is such a complicated issue isn't the scientific debate but instead it's the politicization of the topic. 

The left and the right are focussed on using climate change to gain voters just as much as the ceo of Exxon had used the denial of climate change to gain profit. 
It's now either overly sensationalized by one side or completely disregarded by the other. 

When it comes down to it, we don't need an international agreement or a new tax. What we need to do, is to reinvest some capital from spending of lesser importance into more efficient and environmentally friendly technologies. 

It's quite simple. Even if 50% of people don't believe in climate change, why would someone disagree with decreasing the production of pollution and waste.
Witches can conger up demonic storms and arrange accidents for people they want to sacrafice to Satan,or get even with.I bind and rebuke every demonic wind and storm in the name of Jesus.Father if this storm is demonic,redirect it,in the name of Jesus.of course,it only works for those who believe Jesus is the son of God,that he died on the cross,and was risen from the dead,and sits on the right hand of the Father.REPENT,and turn to Jesus Christ,before it is to late.
i don't want to die
I'll just say: mass production of meat.
NO ONE lies to my mum!
unsubscribed!
One thing I think would be important to mention is how the president of Brasil Jair Bolsonaro is opening the Amazon and decreasing security in preserved areas of it so that it is more economically explored and the effects of going any further in the ruthless killing of the Amazon forest could make it impossible for us to reverse our situation. This is a world issue and we all should unite against this. People need to know that how critical the next four years are for the Amazon and climate change.
Ahh please tax me save me from the nice weather. Its a hoax. We know the alarmist predictions don't come true. We have caught you lying including the lies you are regurgitating here. Pathetic
Please include the carbon footprint of eating meat and reducing meat consumption as a practical way to reduce pollution!! :D
All fake
Climate change is real
Co2 is a greenhouse gas
The earth has warmed
No one denies this. 
But to say the co2 contributions of humans, which is two percent of natural contribution according to the ipcc, is 100 percent responsible is a long shot in my book.  Science isnt a consensus.
LOL...Another Soros funded propaganda.  Stereotypical no data, no citations, no contrary views and cute drawings.  Oh, and ignoring that we are currently in a cooling period.
Wow i haven't watched an asap science video since high school and to be honest it seems like it has gone downhill, mediocre coverage at best with mere surface level reporting that seems like it is targeted to a 10-15 year old audience.
Nuts
Global warming is fake
This isn't anything new they just go to whatever party they can get the most out of. Right now it's the Democrats.
The earth should be in a cooling phase by most of the cycles that influence climate but, it’s not even deniers won’t contest that anymore that it’s not cooling. Once the Greenland ice sheets really start fracturing no one knows what is next
Carbon dioxide isn’t really the biggest threat to the planet’s future. There are other non-recyclable pollutants we release more of now than ever that are worse for the environment and humans.
I will be 26 in 12 years. 12 years is when we will be in emergency mode. I would have not lived a full life and none of it is my fault. I will have to change this mess because these adults can’t care for the planet that makes them money. The planet should go first then money second. I am so sad now becuase I don’t want to die in 12 years because of greedy adults that only care about money. I shouldn’t have to go out and protest for my planet at my age, that is messed up and adults seeing this please, please help save this planet more than I can. Don’t leave it to the politicians and kids to fix it. You do something about it too.
why is Mitch so hot
Came to check dislikes
So you said we have hope. How do we have hope when the people who lied scammed and cheated us now have billions of dollars that can be easily used to manipulate people and alter ideas to benefit them? I mean sure we may have the common sense to realize what reality is, but a lot of people are either delusional to the fact or too greedy to even care or too hopeless to do anything about it.
Climate has changed before humans and it will change long after we’ve gone. We can’t hurt this planet, it’s too big. However it can wipe us off of its back in a second, without a trace. And it of course will. It’s only a matter of time.
I am republican and i belive in global warming
You had me until you mentioned the Green New Deal at the end. Never in our history has a more idiotic bill been proposed on the House floor
OMG I was just learning about this chemistry today, nice timing ASAP science cuz u know u always upload as soon as possible? 😅
Gaylord. Weather modification, that’s why it’s warming up. Do they pay you to peddle this wank?
Fuel isn’t the biggest cause of global warming/climate change!! Its animal agriculture!
What is with the Wikipedia link? Is YouTube trying to drive a narrative?
On the other hand, greenhouse gases are keeping the ice age at bay. How about cleaning up all that plastic garbage in the ocean?
Co2 isn't even the biggest problem of our earth. There were many eras in the history of our planet when there was even more Co2 in the athmosphere than we have today. I think the bigger problem is the amount of plastic and garbage that is accumulating in forests and oceans.
I get that global warming is real but the earth has been warming for 10 000 years. How is he going to stop the non-man made global warming as well? and why is this never addressed? Maybe people will just have to accept that the globe will warm and the sea will rise and deal with it. This guy said that global warming will cost the world what $17 trillion by 2100? and that's for the whole world. The AOC plan is $93 trillion and only covers one country. The world does not simply end because the sea level rises less than a foot over 100 years.
Who would win? 
Climate Change is not a Thing
Vs
The Earth is flat
Ok now I’m scared 😱
Where’s your sources? Where’d you get this?
If 2020 doesn't get better or something I'm need y'all to stop this earth so y'all can let me off 🤷🏿‍♀
It's funny, because anybody with a brain that lived more than a decade on this planet can notice that climate change is a thing.
The most frustrating part of this video is no one denies "Climate Change".  There are those of us who question mankind's impact upon, and the ability to control climate change.  Here is a link to the most common sense view I can find: www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtBxI_ydba4
I'm pretty sure correct me if I'm wrong, but out of the G20 countries, America produced the least amount of CO2 despite Trump not believing in Climate change (hopefully Congress or the next president in 2025 will make efforts to reduce climate change) and China produced the most CO2 despite being communist/developing country
My only thing is the Earth's climate has changed significantly in the past. There were times long before humans where there was no ice and times when the Earth was a snowball. Around 20 000 years ago ice sheets came down almost all of Canada and a lot of Britain. The Earth may be getting warmer but whats to say it's not natural? Questioning accepted beliefs at the time is what had gotten us this far anyway. Sure co2 may cause a greenhouse-like effect and we can see that with venus. However, since 1850 the earth's average temperature has increased by 0.85ºc since 1850 we have released 910 gigatonnes of co2. However, around a third of that has been released since 2000. So a third of the increase right? But really there hasn't been a consistent rise at all. If we can do something that would be great but should put a lot more effort into evaluating the situation, especially over more recent time frames before we lots of money and resources trying to fix something we can't fix.
Climate change “deniers” aren’t denying climate change, they are denying man made climate change.
Way to strawman
Great video
I only want food without getting fat!!!!...oh!! and green energy of course!!
3K Exxon employees disliked the video
"Climate change" is the modern term as local weather events experience extremes in both directions. The geological record indicates a different problem, which is out of our hands. Spoiler alert, high priced plastics and lubricants will be the future of the oil industry, with a heavy reliance upon plant sourced hydrocarbon chemicals. The problems of pollution are more easily seen in the water. Ambient plastic (from the same source as fuel) is more directly responsible for the mass extinction event than any other human input to Earth. The higher prices must be demanded, to justify clean up work at a living wage. The IPCC uses a model that blames humans for temperature variations caused solar input. Basically, don't echo any political party if you're interested in science. You can educate yourself from the info made public by close to 1 million scientists, or 3%, rather than the 97% who calculate information from the same source that doesn't recognize any solar variation.  has data available for people who can evaluate validity of scientific papers and might have access to controversial research from deep state actors that benefit from the aerospace industry.
Stop believe the brain wash everything on earth works on cycle  Hot sun or ice age for millions of years work in circles of cycle of 12Kto 30K years. Everything else is a lie that  created jobs and money (that we need!)
As long as you can't isolate the variables your research means squat

SCIENTIFIC METHOD 101
One thing that annoys me is that people always think that republicans are climate change deniers. This is absolutely false. The majority of us know that the climate is changing. EVEN DONALD TRUMP. Yes, it's true Donald Trump knows that global warming is real. He was slow to realize it, as some of us were. However in modern times almost everyone, and everyone who is smart knows climate change is real. The only difference is how we want to solve it. And how fast we think it happens (the world won't end in 12 years unless there is a massive nuclear war).
The biggest lie about climate change is saying animal agriculture doesnt contribute to the global warming, when in fact it is THE leading cause....
Go Vegan my dudes <3
There's a very good reason to improve vehicle efficiency. A good economic reason. GW is a scam.
There is not a concensus regarding Global Warming, Some parts of the planet are actually getting colder!
If this inspired anyone to actually DO something about global warming... go watch conspiracy. Literally changed my life
i love watching the government not give a crap while i cant do anything
That is the most misleading title ever lol
Those ignorant conservatives on twitter should really check this video out lol, no wonder they’re brainwashed into thinking that “humans don’t cause global warming” and that “global warming is a natural process that has happened before in the past” like what the heck?? The government is really tryna get y’all to believe that this issue ain’t a big deal when it actually is.
A look back in history tells the climate is always changing, sometimes very quickly. Man's co2 has no effect on the climate of planet Earth. Also, your video is so full of BS about how climate science started that I will just assume youre a young person and learning best you can.
These kind of emotional screes have no place in scientific discussions.  There is no science in this scree.  None.  Elementary school discussion.
Methane and other pollutants from animal agriculture is possibly more dangerous than CO2 from fossil fuel. People don't like to discuss this as much because we like our burgers and bacon.
This is the video i was waiting for
Awesome video!
Just going to say this but the first papers published for climate change, and even the first calculations made on the subject weren't published in the 1980's.... But in the 1800's, the first calculation of human induced climate change was done in 1896... But even before then there were many from Joseph Fourier to John Tyndall found that different gasses like carbon dioxide and methane absorb more radiation and thus heat up the surface... Another major step towards climate change knowledge came in 1938 with Guy Stewart Callendar, again before 1980... Even in the 50's there was a ton of information released.

You talked about the "lies" of climate change, relating to the title, and yet make multiple in the video... The climate change debate started long before the 1970s-1980s... So why did you say that that was when it started?
what more worse than lies about climate change:
-being lied
Exxon discovered how CO2 affects climate they did not discover climate change.
🙄😩😭🤯😒😡
it’s so weird how i remember watching the video that babies were born with mustaches when i was like 7 years old
can someone nuke muricunt?
Wheres the other guy?
I love AsapSciencee!! It teaches boring stuff in fun wayss!!❤
If global warming was gonna kill us all why haven't we invaded China and stopped there coal power stations🤔 wake up people it's a money and power grab
This new asap science style is really unenjoyable to watch. I liked when you didn't slam politics into your vids.
Oh my God you idiot the planet has been getting hotter for like 12,000 years as the ice Age comes to an end.

we have ice cores going back six hundred and fifty thousand years and the last thing planet has ever been is stable at one temperature.

As a matter of fact having ice is a rarity for Earth as it was ice-free for 90% of its existence.

rather than freaking out about melting ice the planet is literally returning back to its natural state
The ice caps were supposed to melt and drown us 10 years ago. Lie lie lie, lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie.
Basic biology dictates green plants like CO2 water and heat. (Photo-Synthesis Gr. 4 Biology)
Speak with confidence. Don't fluctuate your voice like a sassy girl... It's irritating.
bs
My teacher is teaching me the climate change right now coincidence maybe or maybe not
I'm just so angry at all the politicians. I mean, just because most of them are old and will die in a few years and they have a lot of money, so they could be "save" from every impact global warming has on the planet, they just ignore the whole thing and only focus on what could boost the economy. I'm 16 and it scares me. it scares me just to think about how ignorant the older generation is. Are we the only ones that care about it? Probably yes, because it affects us the most and we haven't been brainwashed. But this shouldn't be the reason not to act. I thank everyone in the older generation, that still tries to save the planet, because they're doing it for us and or the future. All the politicians are like money, money, money, saying the global warming doesn't exist so that people use all the oils and make the economy grow. It's all about the money to them. I want to study environmental science or life science to find a way to save the planet, honestly at this point I don't care anymore if I don't earn tons of money and live in a big house with a pool and all that stuff I dreamed about as a child. I can and will live in a smaller house, if at least I am doing a job that helps the planet and where I^m not just there, watching as humanity destroys itself.
Video is bunk.
Ok so your telling me no one got Shane Dawson vibes from the start/whole vid lmao 😂 🐷
Too bad the people with money are way smarter than you and have predicted your reaction decades in advance. You're just a pawn in their game and you don't realize it.
This channel is now just a political channel: AsapPOLITICS
So this guy is a climate scientist, it's true because he knows how to gather favourable information off the internet to back his views. Wow that scientific.
Anyone having children today is reprehensible. I got sterilized in 2007 before every having children. We are doomed and the future is going to be horribly painful for the coming generations. Please do not breed.
Let me just remind everyone that there wouldn’t be oil production at this scale without the huge demand that WE create. We need oil for absolutely everything. From transportation, to food production, to medicine. If you really want to cut oil dependence, then don’t drive a car, don’t buy medicine, don’t buy food at the grocery store, don’t use anything with plastic in it...
Ummm, 
1) The properties of CO2 was discovered long before the 80's.  
2) Exxon's science was public knowledge
3) Uncertainty is real.  ECS is 1.5 to 4.5 dec C per doubling.  The known portion is ~1.1 (CO2 physical property) and the unknown portion is 0.4 to ~3.4 (feedbacks)


If Exxon's research only determined that their work duplicated other scientists, what did they hide in plain sight?
This is a video full of conspiracy theory and supposition.  If CO2 is causing radiative warming of the planet, the greatest rate of warming should be evident aloft in the tropics.  That's a scientific prediction, publicised by the IPCC in Assessment Report 4. The problem is that the atmosphere isn't warming in the way predicted, according the best observations we have collected. If you like science, that's called "falsification by data".  So you might as well talk about fairies at the bottom of the garden, as there is no evidence for them either.
Except the damage estimates by 2100 by the IPCC is $4 trillion. Burning $45 trillion using insanely idiotic government measures is a guaranteed way to murder your economy....Great Leap Forward style....
Okay,  yes while they did try and make it as though climate change wasn't a thing,  others made it as though we would die in the next decade. They were both at fault,  since climate change cannot be solely contributed to humans,  ie the earth's natural weather cycles.  Obviously we do have some part in it,  but not as extreme as they might claim.  Several scientists have even said that some climate change could be attributed to the magnetic field reversal,  the last of which happened over 700,000 years ago,  our climate graphs only going as far back as not even 500,000 years ago.  What we do know,  however,  is that there will be a spike in skin cancer due to the weakening field,  and humans have had some effects on climate,  but not doomsday effects like many environmentalists and politicians are claiming.
im sad
We're f*cked... that's just what it is... and I don't think humans deserve to go and ruin another planet with our greed and selfishness. Hopefully human life ends here. We're just parasites on a grander scale. 

Didn't y'all see The Matrix?! 🤔🤔🤔
Ya know i did a debate against climate change for a school project...




I won pretty easy win though
Nice, making a video cherry picking a random hypocritical company who messed up. Start using russian data on projection for climate change  and then you'll let me believe you. The amount of CO2 in the air was too little in 1980's to effect us according to most scientists. This video is a joke
So y’all know as our body grows it starts dying out, right? So the sun isn’t dead yet , but it’s growing closer to dying out, so shouldn’t the earth get colder then hotter? I don’t believe in global warming, I think it’s stupid, yes pollution is a thing, but it doesn’t kill polar bears. Or melt ice. And don’t reply coming at me, I won’t respond because Idc. If u agree? Cool, ok.otherwise don’t bother. It’s an opinion.
I'm happy that you're trying to promote this problem. I feel that way to many influential companies, people, channels are forgetting the fact that global warming (and in general the health of our planet) is going to be our own extinction if we don't do something radical very soon.!
I love hydrocarbons.  Life would suck without them.
Who’s this lefty soy boy?
((( burnstine )))
remember ozone layer in the 1980s , which was supposed to bring mass extinction , wonder what happened to that lol..
Greenhouse effect is not debated, the problem is that the predicted negative effects of global warming  are consistently overestimated in climate models. The warming is still within the margin of error of most measurements. We should transition towards green energy bc of the pollution and other negative aspects of fossil fuels but it's not like the world is going to end before 2100. Look at some of the discounted studies and see how they hold up. People are trying to get funding by scaring the public.

Take a more calculated approach to climate change.
Exxon didn't discover climate change. It had been bandied about since the 50s. The principals behind it had been understood since the 1800s. It was always understood that industrial output would change the climate, it just wasn't clear weather or not light reflecting particulates would have a stronger forcing effect than green-house and carbon-gases. It was in the 50s that ~most~ people who specialized in the field of studying industrial outputs effects began to understand that carbon-gasses would have a MUCH stronger forcing effect and that the world would heat. ExXon merely confirmed this information for themselves, it wasn't new information, it just wasn't well known to the public.
To be honest I don’t believe that climate change doesn’t exist the earth has gone through multiple warm periods and cold periods
Global warming isn’t real as they portray. The planet has been going through changes since the beginning, look at history. Are we polluting this planet, yep the rich love their money and toys and some dumb down poor folks follow suit. Oh, what's wrong with this fools neck, why does he keep jerking it? Sorry can't take this guy seriously when his body language is so ridiculous.
Educate yourself before making such a shallow activist podcasts.
The climate has always changed. You cannot control it.
This whole video is a lie. Research concerning CO2 emissions has been going on for more than a century.
NO scientist has ever denied the climate changes.
It has always changed. CO2 is not the driver behind warming. Fifth grade science does not explain the complexities of a planet's climate. We do not know fully what affects climate.
What we do know is that CO2 levels are low when compared historically.
We know that the planet has been warming for thousands of years.
We know that glaciers have been receding for a few hundred years.
We know that sea level has been rising for centuries
And we know that "human caused climate change" is a scam
ugh
you're using the same kind of misrepresentations that those oil companies use, therefore fueling the mistrust that they use to turn people against you, you're just adding fuel to the fire, you're not helping
Climate change is a hoax. Earth is actually cooling now.
OMG, what a complete sack of BS.
What is it about lefties and hysteria?
I knew not to take this seriously as soon as I heard his feminine accent
Global Warming is now the biggest commodity on the planet. To own and promote carbon trading is big business. The Global Warming scam is an invented idea to allow control. If you dictate carbon, you effectively control most things. Fuel costs, production costs, collective taxes on over priced 'environmental saving' things. These protesters are clueless. Think about it for one minute. Petrol for example is expensive, one reason given is to protect the planet - load of rubbish. Petrol is a necessary evil most of us have to buy. Governments know this so instead of banning it, they over charge for it under the veil of saving the planet. No amount of campaigning will alter things. Things will alter when, and only when, oil runs out. It has been running out for the last thirty years but still seems as available as ever. Global warming is all smoke and mirrors to allow for higher costs. Unless you have access to raw data you do not know if the ice cap is really melting do you? 


We may be burnt at the stake as heretics. Financialization of nature.
the biggest point you are missing here that the US (and the west in general) is on the bottom of the most polluting countries on the planet. even if you stopped extracting oil and switched to driving electric cars it would change almost nothing. While India and Chila will continue to progress without caring about climate. The fact that this is told to an English speaking audience on daily basis makes no difference. Why do you keep telling this to someone who has no power to change it? is there a hidden agenda you are not talking about?
There are many bigger lies BTW... like how every ten years they make more failed predictions for the next ten years... like... the end of the world every ten years. We are still here...
0:34 I was watching AL Gore on CNN. He was Talking & Talking & Talking and then out of boredem my pet polar bear hung himself…..isn't that ironic? #boburnhamreference
The earths temperature naturally fluctuates hence the beginning and end of the ice age
come on guys, our president even tweeted on this matter: global warming is obviously a hoax created by the chinese!
in the past 100 years, the earth's temperature has raised 9 tenths of 1 degree.  And we have politicians and famous people (like Harrison Ford) saying we will be doomed in about 10 years.  Same old predictions they have been making for more than 50 years...
I'm just a high schooler but we have had a good unit on this in our school. It was not political but just gave us the statistics and Information we need to make our own decisions. Somehow this debate is always engulfed in politics and I hate that because it really doesn't do any good for either side. The green new deal has a lot of flaws and it way too forceful for most peoples liking. In the other hand denying evidence of climate change is counter intuitive. We need to educate people with the facts and let then make their own educated decisions and not let politicians take advantage of the miss information and play them to their hand. 

There are a lot of factors in to global warming. Not just co2 emissions but the loss of ice in the arctics also causes a change in albedo and the darker water compared to the ice absorbs more heat speeding the process up. There are a lot of factors to consider and for an everyday person like us it is hard to get all the information in a topic like this. We need more objective educational videos. Thanks for making this video :).

This is a good video if you are wondering about how we should Clean energy.
fake news







(i’m joking if it wasn’t obvious lmao)
Those scientists were wrong, they lied too but they were also wrong empirically because they failed to account for all the Natural Variables before calculating human influences. The left out variables are the effects of x-rays, particule influx, and The Global Electric Circuit. If you leave out variables that over 600 peer reviewed papers have confirmed their effects on our Climate are real and for some immediate, you will absolutely 100% get the Human Influences side of the equation wrong. Learn more here.
Climate change is real, but not because of CO2 and fossil fuels
Oh no did you say scientists changed their minds?  Yes, the climate is changing as it always does. We survived acid rain, ozone holes and the population bomb.
I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but this is straight up fear mongering to push your political agenda. The current debate isn't whether or not climate change (which you use as a synonym for global warming) exists. The current debate is whether or not we in America should have regulations that damage our economy in exchange for the little impact it will have on the Earth. 

Why do I call it fear mongering? Because you describe the heat the Earth conserves in a day in terms of atomic bombs, predict disastrous consequences which aren't backed by the whole scientific community, and mention that 60% of the worlds creatures have gone extinct (illustrated with pictures of mammals) even though the great majority would go extinct because of natural conditions (living things go extinct by themselves). 

Why do I call this pushing for a political agenda? Because you mentioned the Green New Deal, a bill which people who sponsored it don't even want to vote on because they know it doesn't work as its nothing more than a trillion-dollar destruction of the American economy, banning of nuclear power, extension of government power and bureaucracy, and transition to a socialist economy during the next 10 years. Even if the US cut down CO2 emissions massively the total effect on the world temperature is calculated to be around -0.02° C. 

With all this said, I'm not defending the acts of certain companies. If we're going to fight climate change we need to stop relying on the government and start campaigning for increased research in new and improved technologies. People need energy and they need it for cheap, otherwise they'll go broke and they'll care even less about the environment when they can't even afford to take care of themselves. Stop pushing for bans and regulations when the current state of technology isn't good enough to stop CO2 emissions while mantaining the economic order in the country.
People who call carbon dioxide a pollutant must be amongst the most ignorant brainwashed people on the planet. Plant food (carbon dioxide) is good for the planet, it improves vegetation (food) and helps feed the growing population. Global warming is also good for the vegetaion - let's hope we can increase the carbon dioxide from its current low level of 400 part per million to 1000 ppm - and lets hope we can get the temperature up by a couple of degrees. Stop buying into the 'end of the world' crap, the earth is doing just fine.
This is a great video man. However. It would be cool if you could also inform people how the farming and meat industry is the number one biggest reason for global warming. People need to eat way less animal products as well.
Top stuff AsapScience! One of the best videos I've seen from you in a while.
no one:
scientists: climate change doesn't exist
I as a republican, believe that climate change is real and I do think this is a scumbag thing for corporations to hide, but I do not believe that humans are the main cause of it. No where in your video did you cover this. Make a video about if humans are the main cause of climate change or not before telling us that we should fix it or not, please.
I would also appreciate if you would stop taking so many obviously biased opinions on political issues and present the facts and science and let people draw their own conclusions about them, not word everything so it appeals to your point of view i.e. “hiroshima bomb amount of heat being dropped every day” while the hiroshima bomb only being a very tiny amount of heat compared to the vastness of the entire earth.

A concerned subscriber
Is it..
logical,
scientific,
rational,
sensible,
reasonable,
and systematic to use:
a) a single standard?
~or~
b) a double standard?

dou·ble stand·ard
/ˈdəbəl ˈstandərd/Submit
noun
a rule or principle which is unfairly applied in different ways

Scientists claim the earth orbits around the sun

IF
data is collected from the pov of the scientist for: 
-size of objects
-velocity of objects
-time for traveling distances
AND
the measurements taken are considered scientifically true
THEN
all data should be considered true from the pov of the scientist collecting it. Failing to do so conditions a "double standard"

IF
these are scientific facts:
-standard football field is 53 1/3 yards, or 160 feet, wide
-a skydiver in a belly-to-earth (i.e.,face down) free-fall position is about 195 km/h (122 mph or 54 m/s). 
-a trip by train across Canada takes 5 days
THEN
by the same standard, the sun orbiting around the earth while the earth remains stationary is a scientific fact
From every scientist's pov, they observe being on top of the sphere meaning the sun moves over the scientist;
the scientist doesn't move around the sun.

IF
earth (a mass object) and our bodies' (mass objects) free fall is the same regardless of mass size
THEN
The earth and our bodies would be falling around the sun at the same rate of speed
AND IF
there are people located on the side of the earth opposite the earth's orbital direction
THEN
the earth will be pushing them at the same rate as a vehicle would push them going 1,656 km/hr causing a weight/force of the body PLUS the force of the earth on the body
AND IF
there are people located on the side of the earth falling in the same direction the earth is falling
THEN
the weight/force the body would measure on the earth surface would be equal to the body on the floor inside of a free-falling elevator :: 0kg.

Conclusion
Since body weight is uniform regardless of the body's earth location, the earth surface is acting on the body uniformly regardless of the body's earth location, ie., not moving at 1,656 km/hr.
Climate change is a myth. I don’t know where you are getting your “facts” but they are grossly exaggerated.
Climate Change is real, but the alarmists are blowing it up more than it is. I agree with something that Trump said. Don't let the government figure out a solution. Let American businesses do that.
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING, it was not that long ago that WE WETE TOLD WE WERE GOING INTO A DEEP FREEZE, you didn’t mention this at all so in my opinion this is just more BS.
Climate changes period. The sun drives the climate. We need to get to controlling the pollution and plastics that are killing our earth and let the "the sky is falling" believers go. We have always had warming and cooling periods...guess what: we've had 4 ice ages as well. Gobal warming has been played onto the people and practically no one does research....lets clean up the earth and forget about trying to control the weather...we can't.
I understand what you’re saying, but comparing to recent events, I am confused. This passed winter, temps reached an all time low in the North East. Reaching as low as -46°F.
Global Warming is the biggest scam aka HOAX ever.
Global Warming • Big Govt money grab
Carbon dioxide accounts for less than 1% of the greenhouse gases, even with all of mankind's contributions. However, the real reason you and so many people push the global warming agenda is due to a savior complex. You want desperately to be seen as a hero who saves the world.
Rising sea levels are good. Warm is better. Dinosaurs lived in a World much warmer than our current Earth and they didn't burn in a desert they had MUCH more rainfall. A warmer earth means less global deserts. More CO2 means more for the new plants to breathe...
Unfortunately, the last 2 decades show hardly any "warming" and fewer hurricanes and overall rainfall. That means the warming isn't as real as it needs to be. :)
climate change.as he always change,when the political influence the science.i call it 
mass indoctrination-propaganda not science
.
Politicians + climate science = corruption
Remember in the 1970's we were warned of global cooling,  1974 Time magazine had cover of global cooling, in  1975 Newsweek magazine warned of another ice age. No wonder so many aren't too concerned. Then climategate where climate data was faked and then temperature data "adjustment of past temperature data".  No wonder there are a lot of skeptics. But this time it will be different.
That was a great video, thank you for the in depth content!
My Chem 215 professor with a doctorate in Chemistry taught our class that there is no consensus about climate change, and that the earth's climate has been changing for millions of years. Nice try, liberal fuckboiis.
Why aren’t you talking about how meat eating also contributes to global warming even more than oil and vehicles?
The biggest lie about Climate Change is that CO2 drives climate and global temperatures.
GUYS IS JUST BEGAN, NO. IT'S ALREADY BEEN
It is now actually cooler than the 1980s
And to think I just learned what science class couldn't do in 10 years 🤦🏿‍♂️... Thanks bro 😎🇻🇮
Build a few nuclear plants, invest in wind and solar technology, make planes and boats more efficient, plant a lot of trees where there is desert, do the thing where a lot of cows walk on shit grass and make it good grass again. Bang I just solved climate change.
People should be far more worried about the coming ice age. We are due for one. And even if there is a global warming right now. That will be short lived. Humans and technology constantly advance so pollution and pumping CO2 will diminish over the years because of sheer technology. So even if it warms up. That will end and then temps will plummet and an Ice age will start which will last for 200,000+ years. Warm periods like now last for ~10-12,000 years. We are already at 11,000 years into a "warm period"..


So a little warming with more plant growth, they love CO2 is a minor problem for a while, then the tune will change to "Winter is coming".


Also, climate change is a mega money industry now. So don't be fooled and it also fits into globalism agenda and pushing for migrants to enter the West.
Some models show the temps haven't increased in recent years. There are also a lot of "Hockey stick" graphs that skew the actual overall picture.
But it's easier to just "do as you're told". Naive people always outnumber people that do not just take things at face value because "someone told you so".


Furthermore no one is denying climate change. Climate has changed since dawn memoriam. And will continue to do so.
The fact that you showed her and the green new deal made not care about global warming anymore 😕
The first rule of public safety: Keep the public ignorant of what's really going on. Peace.
Welcome to the resistance, Millennials (and some Gen-Z).  Just be careful with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has some good ideas but she's confusing Socialism (the ideology) with Social (the adverb). She thinks they're the same thing and they're NOT.
I don’t get how you could make this without a single mention of al gore. Seems a little misleading
Global warming was debunked as not dangerous. A scientist studying the subjuct says its actually just a normal thing. And not a big issue like everyone thinks
The dumb thing is how the story changes on both sides. I do consider climate change real but when the term goes from global warming to climate change all of the sudden, those who didn't buy into it are even less likely to consider it real as now it's way more vague in definition and I completely understand them.
People who don’t believe in climate change need to open their eyes.The entire pacific realm will be annihilated by 2100,if not earlier.Hurricanes are getting stronger and more frequent with every passing year.Polar vortexes might end up becoming a new kind of natural disaster.Kids in China and Thailand have to wear masks when going to school just so they don’t breathe in the toxic air.We need to do something,or else it will be too late.It might already be too late
You had me UNTIL you brought up the Green New Deal...
the 97% is also a lie
Thank you Asap science. Everyone hold on strong the trolls are coming .....
Junk Science.  The earth has warmed and cooled many times in the past several 100k years.
yeah talk about greenhouse gases and don't mention meat production that is biggest cause of global warming, gj
I quite agree with you,The Biggest Lie About Climate Change,Is the .Stories. of a Fairy Tales. and indoctrination in  schools
SOOOOO proud of you guys for making this video....sequencing and presentation of ideas are well thought out and easy to understand...EXACTLY what is needed.  :-)
The thing is, whether it's real or not, the answer is not socialist leftism. They want to use it as an excuse to get all the power to socialise and destroy America. Innovation and free markets are the only good solution
I don’t mean to unceremoniously burst the ideological bubble that this video appeals to, but I must say that this is a rather gross mischaracterization of the conservative position on climate change. 

One of the points that asapscience reiterated is the lack of “debate” on this issue. This is mostly correct, but generally misleading. Yes, there is certainly no debate among the scientific community that climate change is real and worsening. Contrary to what this video might convey, most in the Republican Party would agree with this assessment. 

The “debate” does still exist with regards to both the imminence of the threat and the optimal course of action to address it. The IPCC itself projects rising seal levels to occur over the next 100 years, while others in the scientific community predict it to happen sooner. That certainly sounds like debate to me.

In another way, the “debate” is also focused on what to do about it. Is the government of the United States the best facilitator of emission reductions? Or are private, non-profit institutions? If the government has a role (which it certainly does) how big of a role does it play? Will enough everyday Americans pressure business to change environmentally unfriendly practices without the need for a government mandate to do so? Should the onus be put more heavily on developing nations, who constitute the overwhelming majority of harmful emissions production, to modernize their energy sectors? These are the questions that Republicans are asking. It is not denial of the issue of climate change. 

I am not excusing the negligent behavior of companies like Exxon or their profit-driven cognitive dissonance. Nor am I excusing any individual politician in the Republican Party who has willfully denied the existence of climate change over the years. I’d just rather not caricature half of the American electorate as ignorant or as harborers of malevolent intent. Instead, let’s engage in the debate that still exists, and use the fruits of that debate to inform both our personal actions and our votes. Maybe the answer lies in the collective ingenuity of the human race, and not solely in the hands of a government bureaucrat.
Exxon should be sued and forced to use renewable sources.
Climate change is a lie....there is no evidence that global warming is man made...there is lots of evidence that global warming is not man made...in roman times the world was warmer than it is now and there was not a single car on the road....the UK had tropical plants in roman times now that is evidence.....stop being ignorant find out the science that proves firstly that the temperature of the world never stays still it constantly goes up and down...even NASA has stated that the sun is making the world hotter....
I thought this video was going to illustrate the ways that people pushing the climate change narrative were misinforming people. Instead the video used the same talking points.
This is a very misinformed episode. Climate change has always happened. Are we speeding it up? Maybe.  But the world isn't going to end and it's not going to be like the Day After Tomorrow.
Both sides exaggerate, A LOT, all I know is that I have read scientific reports saying that we should more or less already be dead for over a decade ago, I have also seen people completely deny the effects of carbon dioxide. Clearly, co2 has an effect on the climate, but clearly, it isn't as much as a lot of people will have you think it will. Even this video uses statistics very incorrectly "60% of wildlife has gone extinct" which is not because of global warming but mostly from pollution and hunting. If we look at the big picture, because never do PSAS as these do, they never give you the science. 
we are at roughly 400ppm co2 in the atmosphere, would we go below 280 ppm then we are going to die, not just us but all life on earth because photosynthesis ceases to function. the other extinction level event because of high co2 was at roughly 8000ppm. this tells us that we are 7600 ppm from death if we go upwards and 120 ppm from death if we go downwards. historically we have been at 8000ppm and survived and I'm taking my chances there and having only gone up roughly 13ppm, new designs and a lot of energy based technique and motors being developed. we are not going to reach 8000ppm, what we might reach though depending on the very many different natural systems we have on earth which lowers co2 is something lower, and we are very close to extinction. In fact, we have never been this low on co2 in the history of the entire planet. sure we have gone up by 13ppm but we have also gone down by several thousand. co2 definitely affects the atmosphere, not nearly as much as one would think, or like I used to think.
I don't trust conspiracy theories from Harry Potter who was hit by a lawnmower and now inexplicably talks with a nonstop condescending inflection in his voice while trying to speak through his teeth with little avail. All the while constantly doing the "oh no she didn't" head bob. My lord you will haunt my dreams!
I can't believe you mentioned the Green New Deal. It has nothing to do with going green. It's a complete scam for socialism. It would pass universal healthcare and basic income for those unwilling to work. Also, it's "green" policies are absurd. It would make almost all vehicles in the US illegal. It's also against nuclear energy. And the one who reintroduced the bill, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, just bought herself a gas powered car and take trips on planes instead of a train or electric car.
Fake news from the right, as always. World revolution now!
Aspen become a conspiracy theory channel after being bought buy the main stream political science.
I live in asia, and this is not the case
Honest title. This video IS the biggest climate change lie.
Sooo, no ones gonna talk about animal agriculture?
Maybe use less attitude when you speak? You sound like you just broke up with Exxon or something 😂
I'm still not convinced. Every prediction made in the rising temperature of the Earth has been wrong. In 2000, they said the world was going to end in 2016. It is now 2019 and nothing jurrastic has occurred. I would switch to Nuclear Energy but no one wants to. Nuclear energy is super clean and yet the good old Dems and some Repubs don't want it! Ridiculous.
You are over energetic and just cringe as hell
FUN FACT: We’re still gaining Ice in the Polar Ice Caps according to NASA
everyone global warming is REAL!!!!
Sorry bud. Offshore oil rigs FLOAT. Should have looked that one up before you made the vid. Fail.

I don't know anyone who denies the climate is changing... it's ALWAYS changing, cycle after cycle. Where we part company is when you start running around with your hair on fire hitting people over the head with a hockey stick.
"...the burning of CO2..."?  I think he meant the burning of fossil fuels.     CO2 follows warming.  Sunspot activity has been ignored.  Plants need CO2.  We exhale it as a waste product of cellular respiration.  So....it's not evil.  Water vapor is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas.  Can we vilify it as well?  You can only should "the sky is falling!" so many times...
it can be solve Tesla's tower he discovered wireless connection if he didn't die we would have been living in the future if he didn't die we would have unlimited power right now therefore we wouldn't need gasoline powered engine we would have been living in electric powered cars
Dude, you admit in the beginning that Exxon's own scientists were way ahead of the curve and knew about global warming.  Then you go on to say that their scientists are changing their position, but that we can't believe them.  So... You say they are awesome, then you say they aren't and we should not believe them any longer?
The denial narrative has changed to "yes the climate keeps changing, but there is nothing we can do to affect it. Man made climate change is a hoax"
I guess you believe in a flat earth and that they are using chemicals in contrails and every thing . . . .
Cute, however ignorant of the cyclical nature of the planet. You may want to look into how food is produced and the chemicals necessary for that action.
Why would anyone continue watching this video after he claims "Oil companies discovered climate change " ? Just to see how many times he lies ?
No need to stop combustion. Only stop the dumping of the combustion gasses into the atmosphere.
The gasses can actualy be filtered and concentrated. CO2  is actualy a very valuable resource.
Fossil fuels aren't the issue, cow farts are. Go vegan (sarcasm)
It's not a debate if it exists or not, it is more about how we are going to balance economics and environmental responsibility
2019

scientists - hey yo if all y'all would look at this ''new'' amazing way of creating energy without co2 emmisions
everybody - listening
scientists - we basically split atom..
everybody - LALALALOMGENDOFTHEWORLD 
scientists - it's literally the safest and cleanest way of generating electricity
everybody - LALALALOMG FUKUSHIMA NAGASAKI CHERNOBYL LALALALLA
we should directly shut down all the oil companies because they  lie
lol YT algorithm, i though some thing was weird went i saw that soyboy.
I was looking forward to global warming. When's it gonna happen?
You lost me at the Harry Potter glasses.....
Burn world, BURNNNNNN!!!!!!😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂👹👹🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
All the warning in the 70 and 80 , even in the early 2000 but nope . We are still here
Nobody: lets learn science
Youtube: how about i show you this wikipedia article cause global warming is real
Me: then why the f*ck didn't i just go to wikipedia, looking for climate change- oh wait...
me: ...or ask google
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Yup. ASAPScience for the win.
One thing missing here. Which is that the facts do not line up with the predictions, whether made by Exxon, IPCC, or Al Gore. other than that, man you had me scared.
I like the old asap science. This sounds biased and he seems mad....
The narrative in this video is patently false and absurd. There were 3 Exxon scientists (out of 100s) that went to a government conference and reported back to Exxon. They were laughed at and ignored by other scientists that do real work.
Let’s not forget about methane pollution!!!
And who are you to challenge these scientist? A middle-aged Youtuber?
1.) It's real
Do you really think earths climate does not change, there are so many out side factors.
What this video conveniently leaves out, either due to ignorance or propaganda, is that these same scientists claimed back in the 70's that we were headed towards a new ice age. Global warming, a theory from the 90's which has also been replaced by "climate change"--something nobody claims doesn't exist--wasn't considered during the 70's. 
It's also very telling this entire video quotes no studies or facts to defend his position.
People deny truths they do not like.
"Late 80's" - "It's never been this hot" yea as long as you don't count history before The Little Ice Age.
Co2 is not the green house gas you make it out to be... the water vapor is a bigger one.
Our climate always changes and the earth  has been around  much longer then our recorded history of climate. Quit spreading lies quit pretending that you understand the situation.... we have no idea how the world climate works and for one thing I live in alaska and I have seen the palm trees under the glaciers that have recently melted away... we have no idea how the world works... and our records of climate  are only 150 years of the 4.7 billion years the world has existed. Many species have come and gone and that's just how the world works man. Enjoy life stop worrying for the  future cause a meter may hit tomarrow and then  we have something completely different happen.
Whoa, when did Matt Damon grow a beard? Seriously, dead ringer.
you are ignorant of solar cycles, please watch adapt 2030 and Oppenheimer Ranch project in YouTube.
it is not C02,not you(or me) but it is the SUN.

Wake up to the truth ,man
This is grossly misleading and severely over simplified. Global warming hypothesis have been around since the 60s with the knowledge that co2 is a greenhouse gas, but it's also always been know that the climate and ecological interactions are much more complicated than more co2 = more warming.

The runaway greenhouse effect is a religiouseque ideology. Nothing wrong with the hypothesis, but the belief in it is entirely faith based and anti-science.

It's obvious in the language and behaviors, the ideology of climate change science (not the real science, but the Bill Nye pop worship) holds all the earmarks of an authoritarian religion, complete with an apocalypse, blasphemy laws, prophets,  deification, praise of ignorance based faith, on and on and on.

Just like a Christian, its almost impossible to see from the inside. Anyone not totally devout is satanic, but of course everyone is a sinner, that's why you pay penance. Everyone uses oil, but no one is a bad person cause they "recycle".

Dishonest ego elitist worshiping sheep.
fake news
Long before us, and long after us - the climate changes. NOT ONE MENTION OF THE SUN -  and how the other planets heat up and cool down at the same rate as Earth. What -do they have coal-powered electricity and cars too? No mention of HAARP - than man made weather creator/manipulating devices that are all over the planet now. Scientist lies all the time - about almost everything - they are liers. They make out the stuff plants need to grow is a pollution. You are so gullible.
Actually the Biggest Lie about Climate change is that its Exactly what they say it is.  Anyone actually want to think reply ill glady show you how to see through the BS
The biggest lie about global warming. Global warming
What is he talking about we’re all supposed to be dead in 12 years lol 😂 😝 lol lmao
Get your facts right dude....
a little climate change is good. It eliminates the undesirables and leaves behind a perfect world.
Club of Rome, population control, UN one world government.
To a hammer everything looks like a nail - climate alarmists are ridiculous and virtue signaling tools, and the person who made this video is like 20 and hence by mere definition not competent or wise enough to make these claims - shame on you for not suppressing you narcissism!!
You are painfully smug. 

What makes you feel so smug if you actually understand this issue?
Have you changed your life to account for what you now know? Is that the reason that you became insufferably smug?
Will that happen to me if I do too?
The solition to global warming is pretty simple: just nuke China & Russia, this will trigger a series of events that will hopefully end in something known as nuclear winter. 
There, planet saved.
If people checked the temperatures for them selves you will find things are normal. Check and see.
Who else doesn't believe in global warming
we have to share this to the public. we must spread it
Can you do a video on why all people lie?
I have yet to meet someone in my life that doesn't lie!
6:40 Thats all you need to know.

Telling people that theyre just being ignorant about climate change isn't an effective way to move forward. That is so relevent today because all anybody wants to do is win a debate and make someone look stupid and make themselves feel good

 Its a real immature way of going about things. The effects of climate change aren't very obvious. 52% of people think climate change is being exagerrated. There may be some truth to that but of course no one will give that any merit. 

I am in favor of clean energy but the discourse between people has to improve. Having genuine questions about climate change should be praised is all im saying. Dont just dismiss someone automatically.
Exxon did not come up with this theory. Dr. Robert Revelle did in the early 1960s, look it up. If this guy can't even get this right what else is lying or wrong about?
This makes me uncomfortable I feel at one with nature so this really is really bad man.... yeah save the planet.
Henny Penny with a PhD.
@AsapScience You forgot to mention the amout of CO2 is emitting the animals. This can lead you to a new topic about how much animals-food waste we have and the amount of damage (direct and indirect) it does to us.
There are no recommendations to this video.
Fake scientists: global warming is gonna kill all its real and if u deny u r sociopaths 

Me: it’s real and is an issue but it won’t destroy the planet in like 20 year til destroy it in a much longer amount of time
Man made climate change is not a consensus.
We haven't been around in earth long enough to understand climate change, the earth is in a cycle and to think humans...or any force we could create could damage earth is naive. Nothing we do is going to effect the weather. Tell me how this year was the coldest winter we have ever had? -40 Across most the country snow on the ground at some point in all but 2 states. (Hawaii and Florida) and we worrying about global warming? Nah. Global freezing bro. We are overdue for an ice age.

Again. The earth has a cycle and we can't effect it. What we should be focusing on are the real issues like the national debt, health care, taxes, building a wall, and stopping pollution from killing animals/their habitats.
Exxon
innovation that excites
Money greed
But during the Bible times or B.C.E if u prefer scientists have found that there was 10x more cO2 in the air sooooo 🤷‍♂️
AsapPOLITICS
Yes, the message in this video is the biggest lie.  Go and get your pills 🤒
LIESSSSSSSSSS
Global warming or "climate change " is real but it is also a HOAX....it is NOT caused by man...it is NATURE...please read:

For millions of years there has been cycles of warm and cold...every few thousand years there is a change in our climate like today.

This narrative of lies pushed by "scientists" creates millions of jobs and billions in tax....PERFECT SETUP ALONG WITH FEAR.

Any scientist who does not agree with this narrative will NOT receive funding or is ridiculed.

Please believe in climate change because it is going to get a lot worse over the months and years ahead.

The government know the truth and are hiding what is really coming to stop a PANIC.

Attenborough is either a pawn in this collision or is blinded by the lies.

A total disaster is coming our way courtesy of cycles and planetary movements.

This has repeated itself on earth thousands of times over billions of years....NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT IS COMING.

Have you noticed censorship rising globally on your social media accounts or social media offline for hours the past year???.

This is testing to monitor the reactions and PREPAREDNESS.

They know whats coming and a total blanket shutdown will eventuate on you spreading the truths.

God be with you before the event.
Not my mom!!!! D:
This is pure evil.
We need to inject these people with hyper cancer, and then keep them alive, to have them suffer slowly.
99.7% of the 11,944 climate science research papers did not say recent global warming (as opposed to global warming during medieval times) was mostly man made... only 0.5% did.
The whole “97% consensus” is wonky and shady statistics when you discover how the number was actually calculated... it’s really eye opening.

Search YouTube for Lord Christopher Monckton 2014 NIPCC, he gives a presentation during the international conference on climate change, along with Dr. Roy Spencer.
Press F to pay respects to the closed Wii Shop Jan 2019 due to Global Warming
I think there is no hope left for our world, we can try and we can do some stuff to help but we've already done so much damage it's hard to see how it can be fixed
Having lived both in the South and North of Europe, I can tell you we should all be very scared.
pleeease bring up animal agriculture's effects on global warming!!! its so huge and so important!
Only a fool says NO to this.  Say hello FOOLS.
He was doing so well...then he mentioned the green new deal
TESLA IS THE FUTURE! Burn Exxon
Question ... Who exactly were the so-called Exon scientists...... Where those scientists being bought and paid for by people with the same global warming  agenda as in the pre-qualified 97% of only 32% of all scientists hand picked... Truth is , the remainder of 68% had no position om man made global warming ... not enough evidence because of too many variables... Global man made warming , to the extent of disaster , is a manufactured money making scam... Just ask your self , how well can our weathermen predict weather ten days out let along years... Laughable.... If you read the history of false predictions that were proclaimed , we all should have been dead long ago.
No mention of the sun's influence on climate. Do a rethink
Uhm. Search YouTube for Dr. Roy Spencer climate change hoax. He’s an actual climate scientist and literally has developed and continues to gather the climate data and he says “man made” climate change apocalypse is total alarmism...aka a hoax. He literally calls it a hoax.

The IPCC has 72 members, they’re the ones pushing for global carbon taxes bc of man made climate change concerns. The NIPCC (non government international panel on climate change) has 32,000 scientist who disagree with the government agenda of man made climate change scare tactics, taxes, and regulations.

I understand you have a YouTube channel and you’ve done some research, but I urge you to hear the voices and legit arguments of the actual scientists gathering the data and analyzing the climate models...  rather than political pundits and magazine journalists writing and reporting on the climate change topic.

CO2 isn’t even a bleep on the radar when it comes to contributors to the global green house effect, even though CO2 is itself a green house gas. There’s just not enough CO2 in the atmosphere to affect a meaningful increase or decrease in global temperatures, methane and water vapor and other factors wayyyy overshadow any effects from CO2... even if you double the amount of CO2 today. “Zero times two is still zero” is what these scientists are saying because the percentage levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is like 0.001%, so even doubling or tripling it makes statistically insignificant effects on global temperatures. Rising CO2 levels aren’t a causal factor for rising global temperatures, it’s been proven that it’s hoax that stems from showing a correlation from a period of 30 years, but fails to account for all the other periods of warming where there was zero correlation with rising CO2 levels. Correlation is not causation, that’s like science 101 but it’s literally where these Exxon scientists got their idea from and where this climate change fear mongering continues to stem from. 
These scientists even debunk the whole “97% consensus” fallacy... when you find out how the number was calculated... it makes you go wwwwtttttfffff? Does anyone else know this? How do ppl not know this? This is wonky math and shady propaganda...
Climate change is real but not because of us it is natural. We shouldn't put the law in this it would ruined are economy.
What RUBBISH!!!  We need to put a new lock on the door to this kid's round rubber room.
There is no scientific 'consensus' on Climate Change.
This is just Climate Alarmism.
Makes me really think twice about where I get my gas
The green new deal is bad bad policy.
People need to stop reproducing.
Lies the biggest lie of climate change is that it exists
Global warming is caused by people like this person. Huge flamer
Climate change is real blah blah blah... Yep got it. So who's stopped driving their car? Who's stopped flying? Who's not using cooling or heating? Who's stopped using their electronic devices? Who's stopped eating food they didn't grow? Who's stopped expecting the hospital to be open 24/7? Who's stopped turning the tap on for clean water? Get it????
Don't virtue signal & say you have solar panels. How do you think those things were made in China and got to you?
Get it yet?? 
Make the change yourself. Think global, act local.
Cutting CO2 emissions is not useful now... it's too late. it's time to focus on terra-forming. then we will have the knowledge needed to terra-form mars
It wasnt just Exxon. Pretty much all the big oil companies in the 80s had done research into the issue.
There is plenty if evidence to link the same pr firms that worked for tobacco at the same time are now working for oil and or both.

One other point.....it wasn't Exxon that found out about climate change. The first paper on the effects of coal burning and co2 emissions was done in 1867. The common denial argument of "well in the 70s everyone was told it was getting colder" was never in fact the reality. There was something like 47 papers on global warming / climate change in the 70s while only like 6 in global cooling.

Great video though for sure and thank you for it.
As Greta Thunberg said, we don't need to hope, we need to panic
The Pi song music in the background!!!!
BRINNGG ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE. WERE READY TO GOOOOOO :)
Well on Joe Rogan podcast this guy that wrote a book says that 78 procent od people in the USA know that this is real (recent Podcast) and this survey is showing the complete opposite ?
CO2 is not a pollutant, it is needed for our plants to grow. Nitrous oxide and small particulates are pollution.
Why do you have Kolkata framed behind you on your wall
You didn’t talk about any science. Do you think scientists include enough factors such as cosmic radiation in their climate models? Do you think there are good enough explanations for adjusting the historical temperature data? Do you think that the actual temperature being observed below ipcc “lowest” predictions is a sign the models are flawed? Do you think that the observed increasing volume and coverage of Arctic and Antarctic ice refutes the predictions of melting from a few years ago? Do you think the increased forest coverage of the earth over the last decade is related to increased CO2 levels? Do you think the phrase “settled science” is a desirable thing?
Why isnt the CO2 taken in by plants?
If everyone planted an apple tree in their garden, how much effect would it have?
Why can’t you explain or debate this to climate change deniers ? Well I know because you don’t want to burst your bubble! So not sure who else would be convinced other than people who are already convinced
I'll go out on a limb and guess that most of ~1800 people who "disliked" this video so far, from the perspective of wealth and income, are a lot like me. They're poor or middle-class (I mean "temporarily disadvantaged millionaires"), and yet somehow they're able to justify disregarding the future wellbeing of themselves and their children so executives at Exxon, BP, Koch Industries, and others can continue to perpetuate lies about well-established science to further their own enrichment. 

How do those plutocrat boots taste, you easily swindled smooth-brains?
So...you r saying Exxon is Donald Trump..? Like he knows its real but says its not to keep the money coming.
The only reason environmental scientists are saying global warming is real is because if they tell the truth they'll lose their gov money and have to actually work.
Climate change
Load of bs. Man does not effect climate change. The climate changes on a routine basis over huge amounts of time. Man can’t fathom it or really have a handle on the science. But we are not harming it. It’s too big a system. What this is is a money grab. There’s money to be had in the climate change society.
Anthropomorphic climate change is a money racket. Humans are in the middle of a life sustaining window of a few hundred thousand years on a planet 4.5 billion years old. The vast majority of earths history has been inhospitable to life. The earth will experience another ice age no matter what we do and life as we know it will be gone. Prior periods of earths history had co2 levels 12-15 times what they are today, and the life flourished. Let’s work on keeping the oceans clean, pollution down, stop destroying all our forests, and stop killing animals for sport. Human life as we know it depends on fossil fuels and that’s not changing anytime soon, stop the apocalyptic bullshit that the earth is perishing because we are burning dead plants and animals.
How do i know you arent lying?
Trump has a Lot of connections with them. That's why he made the US leave the Paris agreement and why his fanatics also deny climate change.
I need a lawsuit against Lee Raymond and Exxon ASAP and all the money should go to climate organisations to at least try to make up for THE MURDER OF OUR PLANET

that's all
The part about global warming, YES, the evidence(lung cancer and smoking etc.) is clear. 
The other part with all the causes and 2050 is death!? does not have the same strong evidence... 

P.S.
only a journalist would say "making money to the company at someone's expense" EXPENSE!! wat? We all know that it doesn't work like that.
OH NO, all the people who claimed that people who believed in climate change were believing in government lies and scientists paid to promote fake research we're the ones who believed in government lies and scientists paid to promote fake research. I believe it's called irony.
Yes the oil companies want to make money, who doesn't. The left just wants us to pay alot of taxes and also if global warming is real then why is mars warming up
Capitalism will end the world 👍
How do you draw so fastttttt
Except... 
There isn't a scientific concensus. There are several theories, few facts, and a lot of assumptions.
Greenhouse gasses could be a serious driving factor in global warming, but the earth is currently colder on average than something like 95% of history and we are due for a reversal (because the earth has followed this cycle since it was formed millions of years ago).
Also take into account that heat and greenhouse gasses are actually good for the planet (not us) as they both lead to more flora which leads to more oxygen and food which leads to more quantity and variation of fauna. Just because humans are weak and can't handle a few degrees of temperature change doesn't mean it's bad for the planet. 

It's time we stopped worrying about something we have little control over and start focusing on the things we can do. Like when the hell are we going to start colonizing and terraforming Mars? The earth is getting warmer, but if we hadn't overpopulated it in the first place it wouldn't be an issue (as in people could intentionally live in the cooler parts of the planet because there wouldn't be competition for these locations). 

Stop whining about climate change because Stephen hawking is right, one way or another the earth is going to keep getting hotter and the solutions may have a lot more to do with getting people off earth than trying to cling to a planet that wants to kill us.
wait you like the green new deal
Hey guys great news, even if we all burn because of climate change, in a few million years earth will be back as normal, no need to worry lmao
Why did exxon not invest in alternative energy. Because a table of lazy old men decided it was “easier” to keep things the way it is. This is the same reason we have corporate lobbyists because damn people are too lazy to change up their business smh
Didnt they say in 1980 that by 2000 we”ll all drown?
Now Shell is the most innovative
Goddam it ASAP science. You did it again. Stop getting political.
Holy crap
trump supporters start flagging this video for fake news
Not a single climate change model prediction has come to fruition.
A simple question: Isn't it possible to somehow force the governments to take actions against the climate change by suing them?
global warming and climate change is BS  if you do more research and look up global cooling you will figure this out to
Solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars need fossil fuel to be made. Just saying.

A$APScience: "Stephen Hawking gave a century for humanity to leave Earth"

Me: *heart starts racing in panic
neat alt universe.  can you do one where politicians only hire people to repeat the narrative, ignore all actual science and then tell us the climate change is based on MAN's actions so they can raise a global tax and create a New World Order where all the people are slaves?
then tell the ignorant slaves that anything the politicians  say is right and anything anyone else says, no matter how much truth, is to be made fun of ?
and then HIDE ALL SCIENCE, do not let the people see ANY actual science.  just mock actual science and only support the narrative that would take all power from the people and turn it over to the politicians ?
oh, hey, wait,  THIS  IT THAT alt universe.    YouTube posts a link to the political narrative wikipedia that pushes that fake-science agenda.
ANYONE EVER SEE THE DATA ????  got a link to the database of temperatures ?  or are we only spoon fed how to think and not allowed to think for ourselves ?
The tone of this video is more akin to the religious fervor of the inquisition than science.  Gravity doesn't need consensus, the laws of thermodynamics don't need consensus.  Do your own research people.  Think for yourself and look at all viewpoints to get a full understanding of the topic.  Especially the ones you don't agree with.  Honest discussion of the facts is the way forward.
So we think we can keep the temp the same? Let's hope to whatever God you choose that humans don't end up cooling the earth..
Its so fair that people are so kind and that they're burning fossil fuel and leaving us with bright future.
I have serious doubts about climate change.  

Why aren't the climate models at all accurate. Why isn't the troposhere warming? Why are there more polor bears now then a decade ago. Why change the temperature record? why climate gate? Why not use satellite data? Why are their papers saying climate change will cause flooding and the others that say it will cause drought in the same region?   Why are their scientist bullied out of universities? What greenhouser would continue to get funding for not a problem? 

And what solution doesn't lead to becoming cavemen without electricity and cars.  Oh you say renewables, do the math.

Be skeptical, read and decide for yourself. Don't let the bullies win.
Doomed. We...Are....Doomed.
global warmings is gonna kill and the planet and then maybe a new era thing will began. Just like the ice age, triasstic era, bronze age, etc. there is not much we can do but humans will all be gone and although i don’t really want to die, i am not scared for when humans die out. I think if this generation doesnt die early within the next few will be the last. i barely know what i am talking about so don’t mind me
Quite frankly, I think the bigger issue is that we cant get off of fossil fuels. We just dont have an effective way to make up for it. Trust me, it would be an amazing advertising scheme for a company to say "hey, we have a clean efficient energy source", but it just doesnt exist. The closest would be  nuclear power, but that would require being close to water, and more importantly, the fear of a meltdown. I wish we could survive on windmills and solar panels, but to get enough energy out of them would be more harmful to the environment due to the sheer amount of land and resources do such a thing. Not to mention that both of those sources are inconsistent with power. The Republican party paints it in that light, quite simply because you cant get people to rally behind you if you say it exist but do nothing. Democrats arent any better, because they come up with terrible solutions that cost way too much to have such a little effect. We need a new power source. Quite frankly, it just might not exist
Angry asap 😢
They need to make this story into a movie
What do you mean "I" was lied to? Not everyone's American you know, In fact most people aren't
Overpopulation is the cause of this huge mess, the human species is just a virus to this earth
Biggest reason to climate chance is lack of education and capitalism. Idiots running idiot companies making lies because they dont understand how our enviroment works and only care about MONEY and making more money.
So I was talking with a friend about this stuff, and he brought up a point that I’m not entirely sure how to respond to. He asked why this is such a big deal? If temperatures are rising and sea levels rising, why not just move people over time further inland and further north? I realize logistical issues in trying to force people to move, but he seems to think if the issue becomes bad enough, people will willingly move north and inland anyways.
I’m in mate ☝️ Im doing my bit 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 whose in?
Love this!!! Thanks for making this!
We had a guest speaker at uni in GB explaining that climate change was a lie... he was very convincing. But even if it were, which I do not believe, I still think we need to do a lot to preserve the environment and not cause more harm.
The fact is for the time being oil and gas are the best sources of energy we have. The cost of the others us still too great for what you get out of it. And so far the only solutions proposed will hurrt poor people.
Sea levels are not rising , glaciers are getting bigger , want to hunt a polar bear come to Canada.
Climate change is the original fake news.
WE NEED ACTION
Nobody, including people critical of the whole climate rage also known by there adversaries as "climate deniers" or something like that, disagree with a single.word you are saying. So what is your point?
The current debate about climate change isn't about wether it's real or not. Climate change is real. The debate is about the human influence.
Why Kolkata?
I respect your scientific opinion and I am definitely not a global warming denier however... I hope you don’t think the new green deal is a good idea, you would know it is not if you had a basic understanding of economics and human rights.
Love the video! Was going to write about this myself, but feel like I can just share this now, so thank you! Quick question - which link is the source for the stat of 80% of Americans believed we needed to do something about climate change 30 years ago?
Yes i believe global warming is real...now can someone point me in the direction of a realistic solution for it?
This story needs to be told. People should know they've been duped!
How the hell do people doubt global warming. It's stupid atleast in our times.
Dozens of volcano's erupt every year and they put out more CO2 and green house gasses then mans industry has or is or ever will.
THEY LIED TO MY MOM
I'm 15 and I went on a strike in Dublin (Ireland) yesterday about climate change action, I stood in solidarity with thousands of other kids my age. We are an agricultural country and doing very badly at climate action. Why should I get education if people won't believe the educated?
Aoc’s green new deal is bad and I’m just here waiting to see if he would support it or will he be against it. But from watching the video I’m not sure anymore. Aoc’s green new deal tackles climate change in a overly serious way. I mean rebuilding everything in America doesn’t seem like a perfectly sound idea
What about Cowspiracy?
I mean, for me, the biggest 'lie' about climate change was that our eating habits have absolutely nothing to do with climate change and that it is sustainable to eat meat. (Or, well, it was more like lack of information, as no one ever told me? In primary school we had to do presentations, posters or whatever about environmental issues every year, but no one ever mentioned the impact of the meat or dairy industry, or that we could also reduce our footprint by consuming less meat.)
Global warming is not catastrophic
uhm I feel like I just walked into class and found out there's a substitute today
This voice.. is not familiar. It’s like sitting in a different desk in class
This feels like a filler episode.
Kylie Jenner would like to: know your location
This felt like I was watching an ad.
Who's voice is that? No hate. It's just different to what I know
Scared of injections?

Inject that anaesthesia right in.
Why is AsapSCIENCE promoting lip filler? This feels weird...
Can you do a video on nose jobs?
1820: "We're gonna have flying cars in the future."
2019: Lip fillers
Who’s voice is this and why does it sound like my aunt that lives in a motel
wait, but aren’t lips already filled with blood and stuff?
The answer is No. Just learn to love yourself.
That’s how lip filler works.
Wasnt sure if it was a different speaker at first, or just Mitch's voice pitched up. You both have the exact same intonation
This made me think of the scream extractor from Monsters Inc
But the real question is, should you get meat scepter filler?
I think filled lips look weird but you do you...
Sure. Lets fill our lips with cement and cooking oil
How is this science? This is literally the pamphlet of a cosmetic agency 😂
Another side effects is that you might look like a duck.
I think it would also be relevant to say that the hyaluronic acid (HA) used for injectables is not exactly the same as the HA found in our body. The HA used in fillers mostly comes from the combs of roosters (the flap under their neck). And since the demand for HA has increased, poultry farms are encouraged to breed roosters to have big combs, which are filled with HA in response to testosterones. Although the HA is filtered to remove impurities, hormones are known to be difficult to remove completely, especially in HA which has a complex molecular structure. Since adding hormones can have effects in the long run on our endocrine system, I think it's a possible risk worth noting :)
Personally, I don't think it looks good whatsoever...
I think it’s also important to talk about the psychological facts. While physically safe is it good for your mental health that you’re willing to spend $500-$2k every 4-6 months because you can’t find peace with what you were born with?
Girl you’re amazing just the way you are 🎶
This video should be titled "is it safe to get lip fillers" rather than should you get lip fillers, because the answer to "should I get any surgical treatment I don't need" from a moral and scientific standpoint should be no. Any procedure that is not necessary for your health is just that, it is not necessary, and however low the risks are you are still taking risks and spending money on something you don't need. 
So should you get them? No, but you still can of course, but no one should tell anyone that they should get any type of cosmetic procedure, especially on a channel that is supposed to be about education in science.
/rant over.
But why do people look like ducks then?
Who’s talking?
If u want to be an ASMR youtuber then yes
Literally just finished watching the Jeffree Star Botox video when I see this XD
I'm black, I don't need lip fillers lmao.
Either I'm stoned or my phone thinks I'm predictable because I was just thinking of this. Just as I got the notification 😬
At the moment I saw the title, I knew Kylie would be mentionned😂
Kylie Jenner: Can I copystrike this?
You guys should check out Photoshop Surgeon!! They made a few videos on removing Kylie and Kim's PS!!!
I have naturally plump lips and Im extremely insecure about them. I find it absurd that some people go crazy with fillers and make them super fat and weird looking..
Yeah...... I'll keep my lips they don't cost me $500-$2,000 every couple of months.
Um big lips really only look good if they’re natural sorry 😂
What are you trying to say ?
COULD YOU PLEASE DO THE SAME THING ABOUT NOSE FILLERS?
What about cups?

TikTok memes
Conclusion : No,don't do it kidz! Love yourself! :"D
Greg and Mitch I need ur voice
100% natural for me.
so... you're saying i should?
okay! that’s all the push i need
I have NEVER seen lip fillers actually improve someone's look.
It just looks so damn fake. But hey, enjoy your plastic life style while you're at it... As the Don said: make America great again 😹
Cmon bruh 😑 this voice its not interesting
Honestly, I was recently talking about getting lip fillers. What a coincidence
Laughs in black
Hi! As much as i love your voiceover , I'm wondering where Mitch and Greg are.
Stick me with a needle to numb me for the needle you are about to stick me with...
i can't tell if this is a male or female voice 🤔
Short answer: NO!!!
Long answer: Never do it by any reason, it's always dangerous and looks monstruous, which totally beats the purpose of doing it in the first place. The lips ALWAYS look better when they are natural. I can tell when they've been messed with, they're not beautiful and look artificial...
You were in the brink of losing a subscriber. I already unsubbed from a channel that, by means of sponsoring, tried to sell that messing with your body like that was OK. AND IT IS NOT!!! It's always dangerous AND awful!
Learn to love yourself everyone ❤️ 


Have a nice day 😄
My school just keeps playing your videos for Science week.
Who is this? I srsly don't know..(´･_･`)
thankyou so much for making this!
I will probably never do that to my lips! 😅
Please make one of these for the brain as well. I swear most people are walking around with brains the size of peas 😂 
(This is a joke, you guys. Don't get offended over it)
I noticed immediately the difference in the voice...I thought this is the sound of your voice after you had a lip filler because something has been done with the lips.😅😅

But this kind of procedure is purely for aesthetic purposes? I mean, was there a case/time that this is medically needed?
Interesting that occlusion and necrosis was omitted as a side effect. Shame on you for downplaying the risks of cosmetic fillers.
No hard feelings but 
The narrator's voice is not family
Today on : Questions nobody asked
So after tattoos
Now lip fillers?
What about trying to love your body?
"put your money where your mouth is"
Should You Get Lip Fillers?
-no

Is it a guy or girl speaking
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ASAP SCIENCE!
I'm not feeling the new voice. Very robotic and unkind
Your voice is very different 




Or is it not your voice?!
Quick answer: no
Gonna be honest, I wasn't the first one 😂
Hey AsapSCIENCE,
Could you make a video giving the basics on relativity and quantum theory and why it is difficult to reconcile the two??
Love your videos, BTW!!
😄😄
Good knows why people are messing with their bodies so much nowadays...
Filled lips are fugly.  Can we all just age being comfortable with who we are?
Isn’t it strange how much someone’s voice can make it so hard to concentrate
So we're not going to talk about the voice over person?  All right, cool.
in the description it says the Narrator's name is Sel Ghebrehiwot, for those of you asking.
Weird lips,but ok
I-


Whos voicing this
I love how your videos are relevant
If you want to increase your chances of getting cancer while paying cash for it too. Then by all means... :v
First the infographic show now you guys 😞
ohh, I just realized my lips are naturally shaped in a cupid's bow. I'm very happy now that I know it's desirable :)
This is posted a week after I got lip filler 🙃
Jeffree Star already taught us this lesson..
i don't want to watch this..it doesn't feel..right
Tbh I like how lips look naturally. There’s seriously no need of lip fillers.
"Thanks kylie" 😂😂
Scared of needles?




We have a needle for that!
what.... happened to the voice?
How long can you live drinking only your own urine?
I know your called ASAPscience and all... but what about the non-scientific reasons you shouldn’t get lip fillers? Like the encouragement of women and men to look a certain way because of the media and just the body dysmorphic disorder in general.
I'm a black guy
Who doesn't like needles
And I look in the mirror everyday
F... NO
honestly who cares mate
Clicked on this video confused ash... like who dis. Hey girl👋🏼
Like I'd u always wanted to comment first but never couldn't bcoz u got the notification a bit late
This is a new voice
Both my parents, grandparents and so on have small flat lips but for some reason I don't Have small lips
First the music, now the voice!? Ahhh
I’m getting thrown off by the voice
I got bullied cause I have big lips. Now everyone wants them but I’m still annoyed with this lip filling thing because people want the good in something and leave out the rest. Same thing with cultural appropriation ;  f.e. if a white girl wanna braid her hair African style, why not, but do you know that a lot of black people got (and still get) problems because of their hair ? I’m talking about being denied a job because of it or others BS racists come up with. That anger is, I think, legitimate and people should maybe start to think before modifying their bodies because « I want to be well perceived by people ».

P.S I don’t buy the « I don’t care about others people regards, I did it for myself » because I mean if you were living in a desert island, that lip filing, boobs job etc... probably would have never cross your mind!
She really said “thanks Kylie “😭🤦🏽‍♀️
I'm in love with the person behind the voice
How do u get inspired for theses Vida?😂
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT INTERMITTENT FASTING
I know this has nothing to do with the video, but can you do a song for 200 digits of pi? Something like a continuation of the video from a few years ago?
"OUR new playlist"...
Are you allergic to non licensed person? 😁
Well looks I’ll be getting my lips done. Science says it’s ok 😂
I've worked for manufacturers of HA and it quite often causes reactions.
Feels like I just walked into the wrong wedding ceremony.
can you make a video on double chin surgery ?
Your hand looks the same but the voice.... a new member for asap science?
Not a fan of the new voice😢 didn’t feel right to the ears.
Buy a Lollipop and use it as lipstick
No thanks, my lips are thin and I'm fine with that
At first i was curious how it affects our body, and the moment the video played, I immediately checked if the Chanel is AsapSCIENCE(and it is), this is all because of THE VOICE... It's new to my ears hahaha~ and the next thing I know I finished the entire video just thinking what happened with the voice I got used to.
If you want to and you go to an experienced practitioner it is great
Short answer: nah
Long answer: ah feck no
Kylie Jenner has joined the chat
Could you make a video on  Tattoos on Body its effect good or bad.. Anything of such kind..
Anyone white 🤷🏼‍♂️😭
That spicy free royalty music
I think this could have gotten a lot more in-depth. What about the difference between ‘permanent’ and ‘semi-permanent / reversible’? There are different products used in different parts of the world, and though HA may be considered one of the safer options, there are plenty of practitioners world wide who do not use this. The risk of black market practitioners is increasing as demand increases. For example, in the UK, I believe, it only takes a 40min course to be qualified to do cosmetic injections. I don’t approve of this educational channel promoting cosmetic surgery in such a way. You need to go for a more educational, informed approach instead of half-assing and making it sound like an ad. Please consider the locality and age of your audience.
I guess the normal AsapSCIENCE guy knew better not to put himself at risk of assasination.
Victim: woman in video
Murderer: Kris Jenner
Motive: protecting her daughter... 's money flow
thank you for furthering my want for lip fillers
Yes now i can get my lip fillers
I've not heard your voice before?
Save your time watching this video...THE ANSWER IS NO. LOVE YOURSELF AS YOU ARE.
The voice made the video impossible to watch had to klick of
I have big lips for a guy, I need it to reduce in size lol
Lol thanks Kylie
Sure, if you want to look all f*cked up.
DSL lips are best lips
Science?  Or makeup tutorial?  That is the question!
Next up: Should you get brain filler
Last i checked u have to keep up with it too so thats a lot of $
I will say the same thing I say whenever someone wants plastic surgery.
1. Wait until you reach at least the 19-25 age range before you do anything. You'll grow into your body. I was a somewhat unattractive teenager, but I've definitely grown well into my body since and wouldn't change anything that would require plastic surgery to do. If you are 19+, continue with next steps. 
2. If you look in the mirror and hate how you look so much that you REALLY feel plastic surgery is necessary to love yourself, mark your calendar for one year from the current date. 
3. Spend the next year trying to love your body for how it is. Maybe even look for people with similar facial features that you think looks good on them. 
4. If after one year, you're still disgusted with how you look, then get the surgery
Kendall Jenner has left the server
Lip fillers look weird anyways 🤷🏾‍♀️
WHERES MITCH??
What if... you're a trumpet player?
this feels like a filler episode tbh
I didn't expect that voice!
LSP wants to know your location
The Kardashians have left the chat
i would like to know who’s voice this is and why the music is different 😂
it's this genderfuck dude again isn't it?
ffs
answer: if you want to
can you do "should you do steroids"
You should do why we feel numb
Lip fillers eventually give you a permanent duck face 🦆👎🏽
Umm .. WHERE IS MITCHELL AND GREG
Good God, don't end up looking like Lisa Rena for the rest of your life.
could you do one for rhinoplasty also???
I love the pen. I had one with red liquid in it. In 5th grade everybody thought it was a real syringe. 😁
All the shade for Kylie 😂😂
What if you use every bomb at once???!!!
Hi Sel- nice to hear you... maybe you guys should do a little introduction so we know who you are?
U get aged ,deal with it like pro , accept you are old . anything else is not good for you .
no thanks, i like my lips the way they are
I thought we were over lip fillers
Wait, did your voice or the voice actor change? I haven't watched for a few years
Nah...Im fine
ive been considering getting assnuts or asshat augmentation i cant afford the two. my third option wld be eyelid augmentation  real puffy heavy set bulging eyelids -every1s doing it !
Got em. Love em. Never going back
"Thanks Kylie"
I need the original narrator, no offense it's just I'm used to his voice.
No one's gonna look at them anyway
Lol I didn't realize it was a different person till I read the comments XD
No, you should get a million dollars
Who's speaking???
But make sure they look natural. Otherwise they just make you look like an idot
Lip filler looks terrible imo
Beauty gurus entered the chat
ok but after listening to the unknown person talk about lip fillers, and just an episode on lip fillers in general, i now understand why this video only has 7.1k vies in 6 hours
I really like this new voice
*kylie Jenner left the chat*
Please do a video on Garcia Cambodia
Sounds like something a lip doctor would say......
As someone who’s scared of needles, the thumbnail for this video makes me squirm.
Mitch, Greg, blink twice if you need help.
This video was made by the lip filler gang
EARLY!!
The voice sounds like they smoke 10 packs a day
Your voice changed
Burning Question: Why do we sing in the shower?
one question: what for
Tana has entered the chat
I heard that repeated lip filler injections can reduce the appearance in the separation between the lips and the skin around it. Do you know if this is true? (if so it would be a major long term consequence as people who get it will have to continue getting it done to maintain their look)
Thank God I have that thick lips, didn't have to think about it in the future
Whoa! This voice totally threw me off. It felt weird and it was kinda hard to pay attention 🙄
I think it’s him but before he went through puberty
No. The answer is no.
Oh hell naw who this new natrator
Don't need to watch the answer is NO.
without even watching a second of the video, no?
Legit thought the voice over was miley cyrus
I know someone else is doing the video
But it seriously sounds like One of them talking i think Mitch is his name
The voice is Sel Ghebrehiwot
Can you do a video on dyslexia?
The narrator got uncomfortably loud at 1:58
You should do the dangers of getting plastic surgery (specifically breast implants)
I love a good pair of DSLs
Is there a permanent one?
As a wind musician... NO WAY.
I want my old teacher back
do a video on nose jobs and voice changes!!!!
Filled lips look like inflatable boats you do rafting in.
Or just love yourself.
Defenitely yes. They can blow a lot better.
I would honestly prefer to have white stuff on my face
Just do it but lie about it, like most celebrities
Who's speaking?
That cool 😎😎
Kardashians have left the chat
Please do : Should people do undereye filler?
Kylie Jenner has left the chat
I didn’t even finish watch the video but i would say NO
Don't like this Video, don't tell me (or worth young viewers) it's ok to have plastic surgery just for the heck of it!
Anybody who thinks you need to 'change' your lips, don't you are just fine as you are!!!
Just get in a bar fight. There you have your free lip fillers!
I got fillers 4 days ago and it’s been great. No side effects whatever
I wonder about long-term effects. Like, does the added plumpness cause a stretching of the skin? How permanent is the change?
Naomi Smalls entered the chat
Are you in my brain?
bro i naturally have a dent in my upper lip and people ask if i have fillers even though im 12
1:43 VOICE CRACK
Can you do one on being vegan
Nah my lips are already good enough
Do implants next
Juvederm, Restyln, Dysport, oh my!💉💉💉👄👄👄
Ummm.... what speed was this recorded at? It sounds like Greg or Mitch inhaled some helium!
Question: why do we scratch to relief an itch when it's often not the solution and makes it worse? I'm talking from a mosquito bite to a rash or just general contact dermatitis and eczema.
Wtf is this voice lol
I don't give a f---, but let's watch it anyway.
I didn’t need to watch to know I’m not getting that. There are big, average(normal/decent), and thin lips. Mine are probably average but I also have a small mouth so I’d probably look like a fish with lip fillers 😂 and I’m happy with my lips so no thank you 🙃
90% of comments: who is this!!
5% of comments: Kylie is SHOOK
3% of comments: lip fillers are weird
1% of comments: this isn't science 
1% of comments: this
Did they just recommend us a lip filler? Wtf?
No. Eww. I will never get plastic surgery
Please do more videos about beauty surgeries and treatments
Am I the only guy who thinks those lips are weird???
Dude, I actually hate when girls do this
My mom is a cosmetologist. This may be dangerous depending on the person and the  situation.
The voice
Who is talking ? A strange voice, not Mitch’s one
Okay gonna go get lip fillers now
Who did voice??
this sounds like mitch’s voices with the pitch raised,,, is it?
New person? The voice sounded different than normal
Having thin lips is actually hot.
Loved the video! 😁
Or, just be happy with yourself.
I was born with big lips so thank u next
I would be afraid of looking unnatural longterm
who is doing the voice
Here before Justin Y.
WHO TF IS SPEAKING
This video doesn't actually address the question of "should you get lip fillers?" at all. It's a good pros and cons list on physical safety. But just because an elective procedure is mostly safe doesn't mean you should do it!
“Thanks Kyle.”
Can you do a video of (what happens when you smoke marijuana) thanks
It would have been great to include information on why people feel the need to do this or psychological effects. It felt a bit like a sponsored video for lip injections as is. I felt very uncomfortable watching it.
WHO IS TALKING
#1 reason not to get them:
They look ridiculous!!! And they're super obvious. If someone tells you that they can't tell, they're lying. Everyone can tell. And that's the point, right?  Even on drag race, probably the best environment to do this, the queens with fillers still look completely stupid.
who voiced this video?
Lmao who tf is this person
MELTING LIPSTICK
Last time I watched was in 6th grade Thought this channel died glad it didn't!!😁
Do One about Braces!!!
omg whose voice is that?!
I was kind of getting into it until the $500- $2000 price part lol
First one here
Tldr: no.
Hi, your lips are great the way they are, you don't need to change your body or face for anything or anyone. Just letting you all know
Does it affect overall performance of the lips 💋 👍👍😂😂😂
I rather look like a normal human being, not like every Instagram "Model".
no. the end.
Dont like how you framed this as something that's okay to do.
Who is talking?????
So happy I’m black, my lips are so perfect.
WHOSE VOICE IS THAT?
That sounds super painful
I'm a guy and my lips, especially the lower one is pretty big, any ideas on how can I shrink them?
Answer : no
What happened with the voices?
Um someone explain whose voice that is
The answer is very simple: no. It looks ridiculous.
Hahaha hell no
Is there a version where you reduce the size of your lips... that's what I need
I’m black no need
🤦🏽‍♀️Don’t do that to yourself. It look very strange and unnatural. I can always tell when someone does that to themselves. It just looks very fake.
No. Life is about much more than plain vanity.
I don’t want my lips to be BIGGER they already too bug
DOLAN dark?
already have big lips.....=(
I don't think you should try to minimize the risks by saying that they are "very rare". Even the best surgeons can not prevent fillers from forming into lumps and possibly getting infected. It's also possible that if you decide to try to dissolve the fillers, that it still won't work.
1:56 wait is that a pen that looks like a syringe?
make a video on chemical peels
*Black, Latina, and Filipino girls have left the chat
Wtf is this content how is it relevant to anything I thought this channel represented in terms of educating the public on relevant matters. In what universe am I improving my own understanding of the world now that I know that lip fillers are not that bad; who is paying them for this??
watching this felt like a sin
No lip fillers for me, thanks. I’m wear my natural lips proudly instead.
I love your channel and videos
0:56 wait what not everybody is born with a Cupid’s bow??
nah I think I'm good thanks
I hate that Lip-Filler trend so much! Look at Madonna, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera - they were so pretty. But they destroyed their beauty with destroying their lips with all those fillers... 🙁 :/
You should but only from certified healthcare professionals like doctors and dentists. Never get them from beauticians because they have no knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the body.
What's wrong with having small lips?
Is the voice that one black girl that was in the ancestry video?? Love herrrr
You're forgetting the possible clot formation by injecting it in the artery, which leads to local necrosis. Or the backflow of HA to the carotids and then to the eyes, resulting in blindness. 
Anesthetics can also be topically applied. 
The filler can be resolved in less than 3 months. It also depends on the injected volume.
Whoa! All the comments are about "no, you shouldn't get lip fillers". Look, if you don't want to get them, it's up to you, but if someone else does then that's up to them. Just because it changes the way they look doesn't mean it's bad. I say if you want to get lip fillers or plastic surgery or whatever, go ahead, as long as it's safe, and as long as you're doing it because you want to, not because you feel like you should.
Only to Rosie Odonnell
Kylie sounds in the distance
Very superficial! Very disappointing video!
The editor takes over..
I dont like how they left out the dangers of silicon lip filler that some unlicensed practitioners use. They are often advertised as a cheaper alternative but I think ignoring the fact that they exist and touting lip filler as safe and side effects as easily treatable is misleading...
Dose no one else read the descriptions
Just lost respect for you guys. This felt like a sponsored ad.
I’m actually surprised they think having this done is OK... that’s a first for this channel! This is NOT GOOD!
Informative
Why am I watching this ? I have natural big lips 😂
let me save you 2 minutes.... don't listen to Kylie Jenner if you want to keep your soul.
So close to unsubbing. This channel has changed so much
wait... who is talking..
I'm glad I naturally have big lips
I think u should only have it if you need it or are old and want to look younger
Nope because my bf loves me the way I am 😚😙😗😗😗😛
felt like sponsored content
do one on rhinoplasty
The science behind the game telephone
Just don't overdo it. Ladies, please...
The syringe they keep showing appears to be a ball point pen.
500-2000 dollers and a constant duck face lol
the answer is no
wait is this person new
New phone who dis?
The voice is like when you see someone sitting in your unassigned assigned seat... Like who is this???
Kylie Jenner has left the chat
I’m bout to go back to hear the right voice.
Wait, so you have to do it every year due to metabolism?
Nah dog who this new girl
who else got an external lip filler ad
Love the new host!
Mwah 💋
WHOS THE HELL IS TALKING
I’m not gonna do this. I need to keep my lips small and doll like. Where’s my Lolita squad?
Wait is this video trying to make me want lip fillers?!
WHERE IS MITCHELL !?!?!?!?!?!?!
No thank you
The answer is no.
What about under eye fillers?
This doesn't sound right...
This didn't need to be a video, stop making filler episodes
I don’t mind you guys doing ads “gotta make money” but don’t pass it off as scientific opinion. The answer you gave which is: lip fillers are safe is not the answer to the question you asked in the title.
This sounds like an advertisement.
PLEASE PLEASE do a video on an otoplasty
Hahahahahahahaha
Good morning
they should make a bones of the body song
THOTS INCOMING
Hi asap science.I have a question . Why do men have a better sense of humour than women.
Haven't disliked a video in a while..
Dancing Hermione got lip fillers it made me kinda sad. I understand it's completely her choice but she had nice lips and didn't do it for any personal reasons.
Is this a dudes voice?
Lol I just asked this on Twitter and now YouTube is recommended to me 😂
No you shouldn’t you should stop climate change
I like this woman's voice
This is not a question I had. Right before the end I was thinking okay so I guess I could then you told us the price and back to nope. Video is again irrelevant and now I’m sad I don’t have better lips. Thanks ASAP Science!
Cool sculpting vid?
Too sketchy.
I don't know how this is even a big topic like wtf. Your lips ?? Maybe Im just missing something.... I miss the simple times
Kylie Jenner has entered the chat room
WHAT IS THIS VIOCE
Who is the reader today?
I seriously read lip flippers
I like jellyfish
I don’t like this voice 😭 It feels odd and weird
Thanks Kylie
Should you get it? No. You should find peace in your body and gracefully age. You're not removing the anxiety - you're delaying it and make the inevitable transition to looking physically older much worse when it happens.
is silicone good for my lips?
Kylie Jenner has left the chat
Who tf is this
Why do you change your voice pitch? Just sounds strange
Lol comment 2
yello
Girls who fill their lips turn me off
The only downside is the propagation of a negative body image that states that lip fillers should exist in the first place.
I am 11th here 😊
new voice?
Who is this?!?!
i have a question.... could the internet actually break???
A Caucas thing.
Вы просто супер :))
first
1
whos voice is this......
Just who
Who is this voice
It looks ridiculous anyways, I don't know why people even bother. Natural is always better.
@jeffreestar
It’s a sad state of affairs when people feel they have to do this to be valued by others.
WHY IS THERE A WOMAN??????
If you're thinking about lip filters another good video is from jeffree star and he explains what happened to him and what not to do
WTF IS THIS VOICE EW
Kylie Jennie left the chat
Thanks Kylie
❤️
Who is this voicing?
Who is this?
Yep.
What are the benefits of being skinny vs fat (higher and lower matabolism
Who is this new narrator and where is the end card?
What would happen if we forgot how to breathe?
Why is this even a thing.
Whos this?
NOPE
I hate the voice
Who’s voice is this
Giant lips will go out of style so best to just overline your lips with lipstick.

Who is that new Voice. And were is the deeper more  buttery voice?
Thanks Kylie

She does lip fillings, huh?
I dont like change

Last
Who is that
Umm... no
The worst risk: overdoing it and looking like some weird monster.
👄
boi, im early....think....think....think you idiot....umm.....Do-dogs ! Thats it ! Dogs! Dogs are the answer !
Who is this sexy narrator?
I mean1st
Sure not, its disgusting
No no we shouldn't
Who's vocie is this
another downside; everyone on earth can tell you've had this procedure done. So do you wanna be judged for beauty? Or vanity?
Honestly I think lip injections look disgusting.
Hi
When i was a child, i had a wierd habit of scraping my lower lip with my teeth and no my lower lip is twice the size of the upper.
Boi
Why do we yawn?
change the voice, i miss the old voice i feel like i can listen better
There is another downside: It's ugly as hell.
Who’s voice is this??
Both of you if you are reading this......Please make video about "Why Oxygen is Dangerous" Please because I am procrastinating LOL but you will also gain views at the same time....you guys know this topic i guess but i an tired of typing please make a video on it pleaseeeee!
My ear hurt  so, what causes ear paiin or hurt???
No.
Ok, im early af
Damn what’s wrong with just getting old?
I got 4.5ml of lip filler in my lips and I’m 21.
the new voice is boring its like trying to listen to a teacher
Who’s talking
Or..idk..learn to love yourself?
No
i’m team natural beauty
I just unsubscribed
White people try and be colored folks while hating colored folks😂😂😂😂😂
No.
Holy crap i saw you guys on the news in Colorado how did you like it? And not the traffic I mean. Sorry if it wasn't you guys
Most times it looks really ugly, so don't do it for cosmetic purpose only
Stop changing voice overs. Please just stick to the og
!!
Kylie Jenner:Its all natural
pop
I don’t know why people spend so much money to look ugly.
Spend your money in your mouth, yeah, i'm talking 'bout food
If anything I need smaller lips
Am I the only one who thinks lip fillers look ugly on 95% of girls?
I did even watch the video I just had to comment. What happened to AsapSCIENCE??? I will be unsubscribing as soon as Im finish. This including a few recent videos has completely left the foundation of truth and intelligence that it once held. Sad to see it go in this direction like a lot of social platforms these days..
Plus they look ugly on most people
I've just licked my lips watching this video...
Maybe you should just be happy with your body...
why does he sound like mitchel stuffed his nose and sucked in a helium balloon
why is this just advertisement for lip fillers
Weird times we live when people are willing to pay money to be ugly.
No
No
THIS IS AWESOME wow biology is cool. Plz do more physics vids tho. Also can u make a song on circuits and like ohms. Thanks u guys make my day.
i dont wanna get lip fillers :( i wanna get my lips smaller :)
Never liked those bigass ugly lips. Just leave your body alone. Hit the gym if you wanna look better. Put that fifth poptart down.
what the hell is this?  More advertisement for lip filler and less science. Boo.
Oof
Umm what’s with the voice
If you want to be a self made billionaire 🙄
Meh why my stomach is already fat why would I need one more body part to be fat?
Well, it made Kylie Jenner a billionaire. So why not?
👁👄👁
Umm......this voice ?
Lana Del Rey
Time to unsubscribe!
Ugly NEXT
Whats up with this upper lip generation?
Who’s talking??????
Who’s voice is this?
Whose voice is this?...
funny how black ppl in history have been constantly judged and ridiculed for having big lips, big butts, and curves and now once white ppl (ie kylie and every other white insta model) does it, it becomes trendy hmmm.. just food for thought.
Uuuuuuum okay
warum hab ich den kanal noch gleich abonniert? und tschüss
this is the most stupid thing to do unless you have horrible looking lips tbh ... which ... i have never seen
I get fixing your lips if you don't have symmetry or something like that. However, I don't get why you would fill your lips if it is to look more "doll"-like or because a celeb did it. Most people I know are into more natural looks which tend to be ruined because surgery is taken to the extreme
I would just say no, and end the video there.
ew
I wonder how much you were paid for this episode. Never seen such a one-sided shilling for something on this channel before
Gross
Amazing video!!
There’s no point in lip filling your lips are perfect just the way they are
I don't understand why people like thick lips, I prefer mine thinner.
Informative but please don't use this person to voice over again- they sound nasally and distracting.
No don't get lip fillers you don't need to and society shouldn't be making it normal to be. Learn to love yourself!
lemme answer the title: no, stop being vain. you dont need it, what you need is mental therapy.
No , you shouldn't 🙂
No, ofc not...
No
1st!!
🦆 unite
i got my lips done a month ago and it’s the best decision i’ve ever made ahahha
is it just me or is the voice really high?
I didnt know cement lips was a new fashion statement
It should be necessary to recommend all over the world(for girls).😂😂😂😂😂
Am listening to a boy or girl?
Quick answer: no
No.   Your welcome. I saved you the 2 min it would have taken to watch this video. You also should not get bags of silicone or saline put into your body. You shouldn't pay thousands of dollars to fix a body that isn't broken. If your not happy with what you have, buying into capitalism won't change that. This video comes off as more of a advertisement than anything informational.
No
LADIES 21y/o male computer science student here. Don't do this if you think this is going to make you look more attractive. It's visibly unnatural and doesn't look more attractive to most men than normal human lips even if they're slim. You do not need a procedure like this to be beautiful, there's other better ways like eating healthy and working out.
No. If you're so unhappy with your body that you want surgery on it to look better then you have body dysmorphia which is a mental illness. This video almost seems like an advert for it. Shame.
uh who the hell is this guy?
White people problems
Kylie Jenner should have watched something like this before she did her lips
No
No
I don’t need it I’m not white.
No
In what world would you want plastic surgery other than for health reasons. Only mentally ill people would sadly :( I hope they get the help they need.
Watching this vid instead of studying
Quit scrolling & get studying lmao.
*Studies hard*
(FAILS)

*YOLO*
(PASSES)
Basically proves that exams are just bullshit . It doesnt test intelligence it tests memory . After i prep for exam and finish it ill immeadiately forget most of the things i memorised after 1-2 days
My exams are over… and I didn't study



I got my results
I PASSED
I think YouTube is spying on me....
Who actually never done study all nighter? It's always planned but you just fall asleep and then try to study morning with much more pressure lol
Forget The Exam, This Video Was Stressful.
My memory palace is on fire. I-it’s burning down...
Needed this. Now i’m gonna continue watching Youtube.
Learn a week before exam
Learn a day before the exam
Learn the morning before exam
For busy busy people...

1. Create memory palaces(Very helpful for medical students)
2. Use mnemonics, rhymes or songs.

3. Don't reread.

4. Don't Stress.... You will have a difficult time recalling information during an exam if you stress.

5. Practice testing yourself.

6. Exercising before studying...

7. Consider rocking...
one more trick- stop watching YouTube now & go study 😆
Anyone else who should be cramming right now but took a 'break'.....🙋‍♂️
I just realized something. According to the evidence in this video, exams are a quite stupid way of learning. Most people stress a lot during exams, and if your stressed you are a lot less likely to remember that in the long term. This allows you to forget all of the knowledge you learned during that test for later life. In conclusion, you probably won't need any of the information that you have to know for exams and if you do, you'll forget it more easily because you were stressed during your exam. 
Just my thoughts, thanks for reading!
Memory Palaces be like,
So Vietnam war happened in my toilet. Where Usa comes regularly to drop bombs.
And Still my mom send me to concentration camps (schools).
I was supposed to have an exam today but it got delayed until tomorrow 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
memory palace...when to remember, you must remember extra stuff
The best way I study is the literal opposite of this video. 
(Extreme stress, re-reading 4-5 times, studying overnight, no practice tests etc.) 
And yet I still get decent grades
Fun fact: Having too much stress can weaken your immune system regardless of temperature. Trust me, I been there and I even got sick after the exam for the summer.
Who here has a exam tomorrow and craming?🙋‍♀️
Ironic 
I have my DELF exam in the morning 
It’s 2:45 am 
It’s an oral test 
Wish me luck
1:32 the last minute cramming tip is not studying too much? got it.
The best way to cram for a test is to binge watch Rick and Morty
Why am on this video.. I have graduated from university 1 year ago
I have a test about Islam tomorrow. Wish me luck


edit: lmao it was easy
Anyone read “gram” in the thumbnail?
To cram for your exam, search YouTube on how to cram for your exam rather than to actually cram for your exam.
2:00 congratulations, now I will stress about trying not to stress
GOOD LUCK fellow year 11 students ~ see you on the other side
Pro tip: Best way to cram for an exam is Test Banks/Previous Exams/Problem Sets with Slader by your side. Combine all for optimum results.
When you just came from school after your last exam.
I love your drawing, Mitch and Greg♥
Summary of the vid:
- Create and use a memory palace.
- Use mnemonics/songs/rhymes.
- Re-reading doesn’t make a difference.
- Try to destress by testing yourself.
- Exercise a little before cramming.
- Figure out and stick to YOUR studying style.
- Get sleep if you’ve already studied.
- Rock to sleep if you don’t have time.

My finals start tomorrow holy shit
Tomorrow is My biology exam and i watching this!!! @alexanderfleming
I should be studying for a math midterm, yet here I am
Happy state testing! I have math testing tmrow, wish me luck!🤞🏼
How did you know I had exams in like a week..still haven't revised for any of them so thanks for this video, very cool
The dislikes are the ones who failed their exam after waching this video.
"Consider rocking" right let me just go get my adult sized rocking horse bed....
procrastination brought me here🙋🏻‍♀️😪
You can only keep 7-9 things in your short term memory so good luck lol
When you really think about it, is sleep really that important?
I have an exam tomorrow......I don't know anything.....everyone is finished with their syllabus.....And I am watching asap videos..
Mom: I thought you were going to study last night?
me thinking about how I slept for 10 hours straight
Me: I was 😎
Good luck on your exam😊💪🏼
Anyone else spend 99.9% of their revision time planning their revision and never using that revision plan?
stop watching and go study!!
CI

I never cram for an exam because I know I'll fail
This would've been of much greater help to me this morning
How does ASAP science know that I have my exam tomorrow?
#cbse
thanks science for naming something that looks like a seahorse HIPPOcampus
I just had a biology exam involving glycosis and the amino acid cycle...


...surreal. XD
My Exams Are Over
After Getting The Notification
Me: TRIGGERED
This should’ve been uploaded during midterms
Great that I'm watching this 2 weeks AFTER my exams.

Good for me.
I just finished watching this video but I can't remember what it was about. Should I watch it again or rock myself to sleep?
somehow I dont wanna imagine ww2 in my living room
"Sleep is for the weak!"
*passes out*😴
legit cramming rn, finals tomorrow. thankyou.
Turns out i was always  scientifically good at cramming .lol
Perfect timing. I'm having an exam tomorrow
Is it just me or does someone noticed many other versions of Justin.Y
This is where our generation has reached, commenting.
Wow, perfect timing like always
for those watching this before cramming:
-associate things you want to remember with things in your house( like rooms)
-use mnemonics
-dont just reread textbooks
-try to avoid stressing 
-take practice tests to improve memory recall and make the actual test less stressful
-do a mini workout before studying
-know your strengths and weaknesses when studying (eg in groups vs alone)
-sleep, essential for remembering things.
- rock when you sleep
Omg I have my exam Tommorrow

Edit!

Have like 3 tomorrow now -_-
I wish I had this 10 hours ago! ;-; I had an exam!😓
Lol, Download after the end if my last exam with 3 hours 🤣
I think you should do a battle video, AsapSCIENCE vs Life Noggin.

I need to cram for my chemistry exam and just watched the periodic table...
So basically I have a physics exam tomorrow :)
How is YouTube giving me recommendations to stuff I only thought in my head? Either way, thank you FBI agent who's monitoring me, love u ur so caring xox
Basic reason for going school is to gain knowledge not to score marks then why should a student should learn it for short term or for temporarily he know about the things he studying so well that he can use in real life thats all I want say
I'm surprised this isn't sponcered by skill share
I dont review, i use my stacked memory




B+ is good enough for me
I used all these tips and now I graduated on Cambridge, now I am asked to accept a job as scientist for NASA because of my all max grades, my question is:What now?
Please make video on that!
now that i have these tips, i’ll continue to put off studying until the night before an exam. Thank you!
2:55 are u from Canada. U know what i mean.🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Thanks, my exams finished yesterday.
wow perfect timing for midterms.. thank you
I guess I'm good at metacognition,
because even before i watched this video I felt that I got better memory by working out for 15 mins. 


I exactly workout for 15 mins,indeed a strange coincidence.
This pi day in math class, our class is listening to your pi song😁😁😁
Cramming = spamming your brain. Try not to do it :D
Perfect timing since I have an exam next Monday
I thought the title was “gram for an exam” lol
You're too late! I'm tested since 25Feb
who's watching this instead of studying or
who has a exam  tomorrow ?
I thought this said Gram for your exam and I’ve never clicked faster
I needed this a month ago before I dropped out.... 🤷‍♀️
Thats exactly What I need.  Thank you.
Can someone give a quick summary of video?? Thanks.😅🤗
Literally a day after my mock exams...thanks
Constitutional test is coming soon in March..Thanks! 👍

Bros, you're 2 weeks late. I coulda used this when I had 4 exams last week.
asapSCIENCE Vs Kurzesagt ¡
Those memorytecniques work but scientificly talking (which you state to be doing) this has nothing to do with "short term memory" :D
You can look up Atkinson and Shiffrins model of the memory if you are interestet ^^
My 12th grade Chemistry exam is in 9 hours. 


I’m failing anyway so I better sleep.
Night guys.
I had a test one hour and thirty minutes ago..... Ya thirty minutes late...
Oké YouTube if you're reading this it's not oké to spy on me anymore, but thanks anyways
I just sleep during test so when i wake up im never stressed and i guess on all the questions some how i pass
Nice but
Let's see how far I would be able to follow 😅😅
Results will explain
Huh... the irony.. this is quite helpful
Dam that intro was pretty accurate it hurts
What I do is take my book and walk around my room while studying!
It really helps, try it!
Good luck to anyone sitting an exam tomorrow
If only this video was done a week ago...
I had 15 tests this week! (I don’t really cram though)
You guys could have added Sans Forgetica! Great timing BTW.
This gets uploaded when I finish my exam😂😂arhh
This was uploaded right after my exam week was over 😅
I love the backgroundmusic in this one!
Dang I should have watched this video yesterday...but I was literally didn’t cuz I was cramming for my midterm today 🙄 fml
A rocking bed?
Lol no thanks.... I like in an earthquake zone.
Genuinely thought the thumbnail said “Gram for an Exam”
I have mock exams tomorrow, 
And holy shit am I procrastinating more than I was before
Where was this yesterday when I took my microbio exam 😂😭
So... taking bupropion actually makes me worse??? Cuz it works based on increasing norepinephrine ☹️ This is bad news.
Is this a blessing or what? Tommorow is my bio exam.
I wish there was a usb plug next to my brain to just plug in a usb and insert info.
Can you do a video explaining how 8d audio works?
Watch at 1.5 speed if you are REALLY short on time
I love how you upload this video as soon as my exams are done. 😃
OMG THANK YOU! I have an exam in 6 hours and this arrived just on time.
Lmao for finals exams I studied a day before and still got better grades than one of my friends who was studying for 2 months😂
watches while I should be studying for an exam
I crammed real hard 2 hrs before my exam and I got an A







I also lied.
Just now.
I always study right before I go to sleep. That way it’s like my visual memory cements it in place. Already took cognitive psychology so I’ve seen these
Thank you so much for this video... I don't have an exam now but this information will definitely be useful in the future 😁
*2 days till my test.  

"This video is for you if you're trying to cram for an exam within a few hours or 1 day away"

Oh I have plenty of time
Next Up: How to Remember your memory palace.
I wish this came out when I was still in school xD
I’m here two weeks before my exam

It’s late for medical school okay
What a coincidence. This video was uploaded on the day my exams started. Next is SST! 😑 I hope this video helps.
Man you couldnt do this like two days ago??! 🤣😭👏
Our exams start on monday to wednesday...AND THIS CAME IN MY RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE PERFECT TIME👌
This video released today and today my exams ended. It would've been helpful before
Lol I just finished exams and I crammed like CRAZYYY
just pop an adderall and zoom. i popped two today and i've never enjoyed doing work more.
Who else doesn't even have an exam coming up?
No way I got time for great courses plus😂
I have 2 exams tomorrow and 2 on monday
Can you make a video about the benefits of walking? 😂
Thanx 
Day after tomorrow is my boards
You helped me a lot
I tend to revise for tests but always feel I have to cram anyway, great tips, and just in time as I have a further maths exam tomorrow
I crammed for the AP Microeconomics exam the night before the test and got a 3 on it (after not even taking the course) lol. And I did get college credit so I'd say that was a success.
good luck and anyone taking the MCAT soon! although you shouldn’t be cramming for that 😂
When you need to cram so you play this video at 1.5x speed
1:06
I wish the Krebs cycle I have to cram was as easy as this :(
Ight yall here me out, instead of staying up later than normal to study, go to sleep on time and get up early to study. You'll feel a lot better and you're able to use that time more effectively for studying and getting to class on time. It's my college cheat code.
I have never studied for a test in my life and I've always gotten straight A's. PS I am in gifted? 🤔
Perfectly coordinated for my math exam next week.
“How to effectively cram for your exam”

Very helpful vids!!! Best of luck to everyone who has their exam tomorrow!!
0:05 nope, I came because I always watch asapSCIENCE videos
On the spot I came up with a way to remember the difference between mitosis and mitosis. 
MY Toe siss (siss being a bacteria) I know its dumb

Literally my exam was on the next day which needed the most cramming ever and I'm watching this now
This was uploaded at the right time. My test is in 2 days :^)
Really a great video helpful for all Indian who are giving board exams like me I have a exam tomorrow
In Australia when don't have our exams until a month before Christmas
How did they know we have exams coming up???🤣
i don’t know how i learn
i don’t study
i don’t do anything to help myself
but i still make 90s and 100s
...how...
Flashcards really helped me when i have to memorize a lot of info, but they're not for every subject
Please can you do a video explaining what actually is time?
You are so so helpful! Thanks a ton for making these videos!
I thought the thumbnail said Gram for the exam and like what are you saying 😂
Sleep? Clearly you started for that exam too early.
Right on the time for *CBSE* exam
the way i tried all of this but i just get higher marks on tests when i don't study. Lol XD XD
What is rocking?  Sounds like really drunk sleeping...
It's 11:03 and I have to go to school at 12:30 and I have an exam . I am for sure not ready! Well let's see what grade I'll get :/
0:56 but I don't have a sharingan
sometimes i wish i could just be robot and it would make things easier 🤖
I had an exam just a few hours go!!!
Couldn't have you released it earlier?
Board exam students?
I JUST HAD AN EXAM! IF THIS VID CAME OUT TWO HOURS AGO I WOULDVE BEEN OK oh well lol
I end up making timetables and never follow them
Who here never has to study and still has above a 3.5 gpa?
Exams tomorrow(personal development, chem, filipino research). Saw in my recommendations. Youtube did something right for once.
I've tried a few times, but the memory palace never worked for me
In India exam are starting this month
My is on 7
mfw you're suggested doing a memory palace but you can't even think of an image to be even half as vivid as the dream you barely remember. Let alone feel like I'm actually looking into my own house mentally. 

q_q
Lol I have an exam in a few hours great timing guys
This video lowkey helped me w some psychology concepts LMAO
Exam is on 2 march and still not covered half of the syllabus
I learn during exam :)
Wow uploaded just in time for my exam tomorrow 😂
Great, this video was posted just after all of my exams.
This video is 3 days late for me. XD
Summary:

1. Memory palace (relate fact with places)
2. Mnemonic devices (Acronyms) 
3. Re-read has no extra benefits 
4. Destress to prevent memory reduction 
5. Practice test/ past year question 
6. Work out 15 mins to increase task speed
7. Metacognition to realize own study style
8. Sleep for memory retention 
9. Rocking bed to sleep faster 
10. Irrelevant Sponsored ads
I literally have an exam in 6 hrs!!!!!!
sksksk life saver i have a whole week of exam next week
Some old hippe caught another hippe tripping on acid
Stop wasting time and go study !!!
I know I should too
Math igcse in a few hours 💀
I dont know that it will help but i will try
When you have five minutes for the exam, but you watch a guide on how to cram info instead.




Jokes aside, just pay attention in class and you won't need to study.
How did y'all know i had a biochem exam tomorrow 😭😭😭 thanks for the tips!!!!
Hey you! Yes, you. Tomorrow might be your exam/ test. So get rest or study ok? Good luck tho! ( my Chinese test is tomorrow 😐)
Your music changed... that gives me anxiety
Asian Ni🅱️🅱️as: we don't do that here
My exams just finished to days ago, but thank you
Well... if you are watching this video and have a few hours to study... chances are you are probably procrastinating.
I wish my exams were multiple choice. In the UK you need to memorise several essays hoping the right question comes up :(
the memory palace is the most useless method of learning. you can't store paragraphs in the memory palace.
These many people came here because there exams are near as well.
⬇
I have a year before my exams come up. Really not looking forward but I 100% want to get through it. Want to finally move on in life.
Perfect-timing
Wow perfect I have my exams in 5 hours
3 days left and im procrastinating with this video boii
This video was recommended while cramming for an exam 🙃
Dude my exams are over now why
Que vídeo!!!! O que estou sentindo mais dificuldade é em relação ao estresse.
Any 12th ke board wale?😂
We (indians) have finals in march... Thanks asapscience ☺
You guys should make a song with that background tune. It's good
I'm watching this instead of studying for my exam
Right on time. It's exam period, everybody.
Wow thanks.... 3 days before the exam... perfect! Time to watch 900 of these until the exam
That background music is awesome!
Pffftttt we all know what a MIND palace is.




Any Sherlockians out there?
Study around 4am-5am,it'll help alot
The music in background is so good I was distracted for half the vid, who got source?
ASAPscience thanks for releasing this after my exam
Should you cram for an exam? Absolutely not, you’ll forget the information right after you take the test. Study 1 week ahead of the test and get some good sleep before the exam. (If you’re majoring in Nursing or any science majors, the beast will undoubtedly screw you over)
I never had to study before this year, and now I'm dying because e I have no idea how or what. I read a book that said you first need to fully understand what you're learning, then organize the information and then repeat it.
wait how do u even rock to sleep if you sleep on an unrockable bed
I basically just crammed for my gcses last year and I got all A*s so I must have been doing something right 😅 for me the most important things are:
1. Eat lots of good food; exams and cramming need lots of energy, no need to count calories for now, just make sure it’s not junk food because it stops you from thinking clearly. I ate loads of porridge, bananas, walnuts, dark chocolate, veggies, salmon, rice, dhal, avocado, berries etc.
2. Drink loads of water!!!!
3. Cram in the evening then sleep well, it’s 1000 times better than staying up all night revising even if you cover more stuff. At least for UK exams it’s less about memorisation and more about applying knowledge, so your brain needs to be alert and rested. Anyway, sleeping after revising helps with remembering it.
4. Use the pomodoro technique, it helps a lot with knowledge retention, concentration and efficiency when you’re studying intensely
last exam out of 4 tomorrow . business yehaw
i re-read but not over and over again 
i do it like a workout
read this first, then the other 
then read it back like 3 times 
test myself, done, 15 min rest
15 min might be long, but it works, i remembered a whole novel with characters and stuff within 3 hours
this works for me
Solo studying works best for me cause lam a reserved person.
How in the world youtube knows that Im cramming?I have an exam tomorrow😎
I Always do a smol test before My tests :D
I'm so glad you posted this on the day I finished exams
For sb living in a subdivided flat,the technique of memory palace doesn‘t work since the living room is my bedroom and my kitchen.(This is HK lol)
My reviewing is stress proof...I don’t review nuff said....😂
This is perfect for my English exams in a few weeks, for which I have done zero revision
My favorite song for such seasons
#HarderBetterFasterStronger
How I crammed for my AP History midterm: Do absolutely nothing and get 70s and 80s in the class that whole semester, and then procede to get a 100 on the test (though that includes 5 points extra credit so technically a 95) I don't think I've ever really studied apart from homework, and still do really well on tests.
I have an exam 2 hours ago and I’m stressing out about it :(
Watching these videos provide no clear benefits.
My exams start from tomorrow and your video is just on right time😍
r u like lowkey telling me to sto procrastinating and study for our exam tommorow
What about those of us who don't have a visual memory?
Avoid too much caffeine and take a 5-10 minutes of rest between reading and memorizing. These helped me a lot in passing my exams.
Power move: study like this^^^^ three weeks before your exams
My mid terms are next week and are really stressing me out but  i have realized that editing videos relaxes me a lot and makes me feel better. Hope i get good grades. Fingers crossed.
Damn i do have an exam next week i guess i need to watch this video :(
exams are literally one day ago and here i am ... watching videos and playing pubg 😓😓
did anyone else love their music ?
i just had my test..3hours ago!
Watching it a day before exams 😂
I have exam in 3 hours this video is helpful
It is also one of the hardest subjects
Edit: the test is easier
Yeah i had 5 minutes left for exam and i m 39seconds late
Any Indian here.
You should do a video on insomnia and ways to try to sleep
Watching this 2 days after my organic chemistry Exam...
I Never Crammed Or Even Studied For An Exam Or Test.
This vid was a week too late for mee🤣
FRIG I'm angry! Like, the guy could at least put REAL slides online and give me something I could have worked with!
I remember a Spanish test which I did a few years back when I was in high school (around year 9). I had to remember 100 words and I did terrible (I didn’t know the exam was on the day) . So the teacher let me retake it and my friend and I felt like we needed to redeem ourselves , and asked if miss could test us on all the words - just for us (and she agreed). In just two
Days I memorised all the verbs by using the mind palace method and wrote down what I associated each word with. The next day, whenever I thought of the English words, the Spanish immediately came to mind. I got 98 and a half on that test. 

TLDR: the mind palace method really works
Thank You.... This will help me cram a script, it is different but it works...
exams? lol who goes to school. just join a trade or build your self in a company stop being a weakling and join a union and retire at before 50 if you start at age 20.



going to school for 5+years even after high school and going in debt and not making money while your spending thise years at school no ty.

I have a exam tomorrow. Wish me luck?
It's my paper tomorrow !wow!
I should be studying for physics why am I here :')
So i was scrolling through music videos on YouTube when suddenly this is in my recommendation :O
I got a math exam due 7th March..any good tips to deal with exam anxiety???
And my exams ended yesterday...
i dont study for exams,
yes iam one of those who dont study and still get good grades



iam also confused
I literally have a science exam the day after tomorrow and I'm watching this instead of studying
I came here just after completing my Exams
Got an exam in 14 hours and need 3 hours in the morning to get there
music makes studying bearable (no lyrics)
Or how about you don't cram and review your notes a bit after you leave class?
Part of my education degree was doing research into psychology and studying..  one of the peer reviewed articles I read said that you retain more info if you study an hour before bed.
Another said that women tend to be best at doing math equations and problems when they're on their period. I found it all fascinating
Can you make videos on
*Whether we should take bath and its impact while we are suffering from fever
*Any harmful effects on health on consuming/using expired food/products and covering all minute details.
I have googled but no satiating answers found. PLZZ
Tomorrow is my board exam and I'm watching this lmao
Too late for this now i finished my exams 2 days ago hahah
Great timing. I have a maths and chemistry exam tomorrow
I never clicked on a video faster than this
Rereadig definitely improves understanding of dense subjects.
y'all my midterm is on 13 chapters and we only have a week to study. pray pls
Make about SOULMATES
lmao i litterly have my second semster exams starting tomorow xD
I should be studying but here we are. 😀
Thanks for publishing this video....at the end of my exams....
I wish I had this video during college! Would have helped so much!
I have to cram 8 CHAPTERS for tommorow. I'm gonna die
It's also been proven that the recollection part of studying is more important than the actual studying/remembering information. So you should try to retrieve the information from your memory more often to remember the information ! (This is coming from a neuropsychology student 🤓)
perfect video, i have an exam i havent studied for today lol
I literally had an exam this morning. could’ve used this video last week lmaooo
I’ve always been good at taking tests whether i study for them or not, i took an algebra 2 test without studying for it and still got 88% and it is that way with all of the classes i’ve taken.
this video was posted as i was walking into an exam. thanks
I read the title as “cream for an exam”
Hey Asap, I wish this video came out two days earlier.... I tanked an exam and this would have helped.😂
Re reading gives me the satisfaction that I can learn something that I was supposed to learn in 3 days in 5 minutes(I can't)
It means to test yourself
Thought it said A gram for the exam ffs 😂
where do i get my rocking bed at
I've been doing this all my life.
Just an opinion, but the reread technique study may not encompass a large reading amount. The study may not have included memorizing minute details in the equation, even though these details may dictate whether someone can barely reach the passing score.
If u dont study the whole year u suffer during exams..no shortcuts..inst gonna help you like this youtube video ..So it's better to study the whole year.
Only if this was uploaded yesterday so I can procrastinate even more instead of studying for my exam today
Ok but you can't cram a physics exam 😶
my finals are next week. thanks for this
!remindme 80 days 

Wait this isnt reddit
Make a video about the laughing gas N2O
I had a German essay that I was expected to write in class the next day, with only a general theme to act as guidance as to what it would be about.
The night before, I wrote a grammatically perfect essay at home that was related to the theme but would be flexible enough to change slightly if the topic were to shift.
I then got out some paper, and wrote the first sentence of the essay. Then I wrote it again with the second sentence. Then again with the third sentence. And so on.
I reproduced the entire essay the next day and got an A+
Thx but my maths and science exams are done
If you wanna revise history just play assassins creed lol
Taking my first exam soon as a sophomore, studying now!
Indians who have board exams in a few days

Who else has exams this month
this week ?🙋
All of your examples are literally what my test is on tomorrow
Exams finished for me but thanks haha
What about relieving subconscious stress? Fun fact, before I went to University I was a chef and have the temperament under stressful situations that helped me in that field. I organize based on challenge level and do prep work well in advance. This results in me being a pretty chill dude. However, this semester things have started happening like a few strands of hair REALLY prematurely greying, or going to the doctors in pain and being told: "this looks like [insert condition] but it's non-adherence to the conditions actual symptoms means it's stress causing it."

I workout three times a week, I make sure to chill out with both of my favourite stress reliefs----YouTube and Video Games an hour and a half a night, I constantly listen to therapeutic music like dreampop because I love it, and make time to watch one movie a week. In short, I don't know why my body is screaming at me that I'm stressed.
Or.....




Write on your arm in a brown pen (to blend into your skin) but I’m not pale so if u are then idk what to say
HERE IS THE BEST TIP

Go buy a rocking bed now use the affiliated link :)
as always, timely and relevant, asap  science haha
I'll be needing this for my 5th grade checkpoint exams and progression tests in April and june
Lol i had a memory palace without knowing
Most helpful video ever 🙏🙏
Guys, here's little something I do

I usually study an hour or two before my exam. When I have my notes, I take a bondpaper and re-write my notes there. Re-writing keeps my memory fresh so whenever I answer, I can almost usually remember which quadrant I wrote this or that, making it way easier for me. Dividing it into sub-cateogires also helps. 

Maybe I'm a visual person..? That may be why an after image is the best way to let me remember things.
Where tf am I going to get a rocking bed
Thanks, man. My exam's today afternoon.
What’s ironic is that I actually have a cellular respiration test tom that I’m stressing over so thanks for the help lol
When i review for tests I don't really follow the real way of something, i use my own strategy like how will i answer this faster and easier, yet get the same result as the complex one (especially for math) and when memorizing , i take the first letter and make a word  out of it , i don't make sentences cause it only confuses me more...

For example : 
Orange
Long
Dress

= Old

And if the word doesn't make sense at all , it's easier for me to memorize it ...

Butter
Onion
Cutter
Seed

=Bocs 
In my head , I'll just remember , chicken...

I have a very weird way of studying, sorry , but i still pass though...
I don't even have to learn it I'm in gr3
The background music is SO FRUSTRATING..!!
My exams starts tommorow.... this is  video really helpful...😊
@AsapSCIENCE I study till 4 am then I sleep till like 10 or 11 in the morning. Is this alright?
Easy just watch V-Sauce
my burning question is- is a soap bar ever really clean?
I just remembered that i have a mock exam tmw
One time, I had to study a series of events in history, so what I decided to do was completely silly.

I dramatized it with stick figures.

The funny thing is, that actually worked really well because it was super distinct, and I remembered it nearly perfectly for the test. Stick figures for the win, baby!
Helpful for biology students
Any Maharashtra Board student here? 👀
I have my exam tomorrow! Perfect timing!!

We really needed this
0:25 get out. i need to go to my mind palace.
Thought it said “Gram for an Exam” and I thought “God, I would love a Gram to comfort me for an exam”
Where the frick am I supposed to get a rocking bed
As if I can get a good night's sleep when I lie there in bed, staring into the abyss, because I'm anxious about the test the next day...
I have a test in 15 days.Thanks for saving meeee
Yeah I think now It's too late. In One week my final and most important exams in high school are coming up😂. I'll cram everything into me I can
Posted1 day after my exam :)
This video is quite interesting because the techniques mentioned in this video are very similar to how millions of muslims around the  world memorise the Quran verbatim. 

“The Qur'an is divided into 114 Surahs (chapters), containing 6,236 verses (comprising some 80,000 words or 330,000 individual characters). This process generally takes between 3 and 6 years part-time together with schooling. Most huffaz have studied as children in special Islamic schools or madrasahs, being instructed in tajwid (rules of recitation) and vocalisation as well as committing the Qur'an to memory.

Huffaz are highly respected within the Islamic community. They are privileged to use the title "Hafiz" before their names. They are tested on their knowledge. For example, in one test they are asked to continue the recitation of a passage taken randomly from the Qur'an. As they do not know which passage will be chosen, they must know the whole text in order to be sure of passing. In another test, a would-be hafiz might be asked to recite verses containing a specific word or phrase.”
Write down everything important from the chapter(s) in your textbook. 
Helps with retention.
My high school psych teacher made us do that. That was pretty much our only hw. It’s called an “outline”
I could of used this 3 days ago
UF! IT'S SRING BREAK, MAN!
None of these methods besides practice tests work for math tests. Cramming also doesn't work for math exams.
Perfect Timing <3
AHH mocks in 3 days 😭
Just before midterms, yall the best
Ah good thing I don’t study at all and still pass everything
King Phillip Coughed On Fred and he got Sick, King Phillip Coughed On Fred and he got Sick, King Phillip Coughed On Fred and he got Sick, King Phillip Coughed On Fred and he got Sick, King Phillip Coughed On Fred and he got Sick.
Good to know but practically useless tips.
Here's how to cram;
1. Title and sub title: Just try to remember the Topics and sub-topics. Don't even care about the body texts.
2. A quick scan to the text: Just try to remember what it is about. Don't push the words into your head, just the main concept and keywords.
3. If you have to study Tables or figures (or both), just look at the shape. Try to remember the outline shape of the table/figure, and only after that, go detail.
4. MOST IMPORTANTLY, Keep calm and be decisive. Don't try to remember too much. Know your limit and let of the rest.
5. It is just an exam. Pass or Fail, it doesn't really matter.
I feel when I don't sleep, I perform better. I kind of forgets what I studied after waking up. I sleep after the exam.
2:20 is actually going to be so helpful for my psychology exam
I can 100% attest to the Mnemonic device. That was how i studied and actually remembered the circle of fifths for music! :D
My Exams are starting from Saturday 😫😓🙁

Memory Palace... Sherlock makes so much more sense now
Could’ve used this yesterday 😂
Wish I saw this yesterday before my exams •_•
Things like exams, tests and GRADING in general are a severe hindrance on peoples success. (No source cited, just an opinion)
I'm mentally incapable of operating in a classroom environment. Therefore I am predestined to work a hard blue collar job and work until my muscles or bones have atrophied.

But my way of learning has allowed me to learn white collar jobs like accounting, business development, operations management, investing and social engineering

All on my own with a book or tutorial online. But I need a piece of paper from a nice college to validate my credibility.

That's all college is, waste even more time in a classroom until your late 20's; get that degree that will make potential employers froth at the mouth and tadaaaaa. You can now be successful!

WRONG!! you get your degree but you have zero experience in the field of study you spent practically your whole life thus far and have to get an internship. (FANCY WORD FOR FREE LABOR) and still be buried in debt from your school and screwed until some employer you're interning for takes pity on you and starts paying you. (Under paying you even though you have a masters)

Dont waste time in class, sieze your destiny, ignore social and societal constructs take your education in your own hands. That is success
Still wasting my time
I could have used this a day ago! 😭
Just like the periodic time table song!!!
Ehh I am too lazy to even cram
How do i do this for german?
Who else gets stressed knowing that stressing reduces ur memory?
The best way to cram for an exam? A gram before the exam.
None of these will work for physics maths and psychology in a levels. Way too much content to turn stuff into songs or put things in rooms. Useless.
I love great courses. They had a couple of great cooking courses too.
Why did I not see this a week earlier 😩😩😩
Ditto on the practice tests, they work the best for me
Kia koi Indian ha ?
HKDSE in one month, and this video comes out? Coincidence? I think not.
I have an exam tomorrow, 14 powerpoints in one night. Time to cram!
Meta-cognition: think about the way you think. "How best do I learn?" "What is best for me?" If you don't know how u think, then u are likely to do badly. {Key Insight}
Sherlock wants to know your location
Okay that was great timing 😂
Thank you I have my exams in a few hrs
Well the best way is to watch anime and cry in the corner

if I translate this video to (ARABIC) will you add the translate?
Watching this video instead of studying for your exam
You just saved the rest of my highschool experience
Can you please make a video about what causes foam in hot chocoalte and coffee?
I don't review at all my long term memory is really good and I recommend the distress method
I like to read twice or even more times one text, because this is how I learn, but I do more than that.
First reading is for learning only general  information.
Second reading is reading whole text and writing most important information on piece of paper.
Third reading is rereading text again with crossed information
Than I test myself or someone ask my questions 
And before the exam I read those notes that I prepared.
Who else would just wing it?
I just cram as normal studying.
I'm watching this as prep for studying
You should do a video on what happens when you inhale helium
Here before viral

Someone link me a rocking bed
I dunno, personally I like to just wait until the night before all of my work is due and then panic.
They said no phones in the exam.  Didn’t say anything about a petroleum generator, 3 extension cords and an Alexa
The best method I use is studying after the exam.
I just finished my exams thx
I’ll forever have that bone song by Hannah Montana stuck in my head. Mnemonic Devices really be keyyy
For me, re reading and repeating the things I need to know in my head works
i misread the thumbnail as “gram for an exam” and my brain started going places with that lol.
this, the periodic table, noble gas is stable, halogens and alkali react agressively. each period we'll see new outer shells while electrons are added moving to the right. thx for helping me memorize the periodic table/
This is great for my calc exam in... an hour and a half
Only if this had came out 2 months before.I needed help
I thought this said gram for an exam
This video gave me a panic attack and brought up some bad memories 😥
So as a teacher, how can I administer a practice test to my students and a) have them take it seriously (the thought that if this doesn't directly affect my grade, so I'm not going to do it is very real) and b.) how can I guarantee that the answers to this practice test show some level of where students are struggling or having misconceptions?

Science teacher if that helps.
i have never seen a mitochondria in my living room
Would doing yoga count for the exercise? It could be relaxing and help to improve a lot
Well you guys are 4hrs late lol but I'm sure I did well!

I thought it was gram for exam and I was about to get taught how to ace my exams after hitting some bud smh
first i read how to gram for your exam and i thought you were gonna tell us to study on cocaine
Thanks sst exam tomorrow
There are times I stay up late to cram projects rather than studying, and I often find it hard to sleep afterwards, the fact that I've only got 2 or 3 hours left for me to sleep keeps on bothering me and it puts me into stress, only making sleeping even harder...
Guys please, I have a Science project coming up, any ideas??
Rah I got mock exams literally next week and I’ve been slacking fr. I didn’t listen because my stress blocked my ears but very soothing to have ASAP science in the back while I stressfully procrastinate
my Linear algebra midterm is in 2 days. lets go

Can you do a video on stress eating?

It's called spy headphones, you're welcome.
How about if you have been studying. Bet you didn't predict that!
So i'm suppose to play hide and seek in my house and pin point where certain terms are to remember for an exam. Sounds time consuming ..nooo lol
Ironic that I’m literally cramping for a midterm rn
Tell me something I don't know
Yessss!!! My boards are tomorrow
Yes actually
How did you know I had a exam today
I needed this a day ago omg
I hate how our school just throws a bunch of lessons at us,heavily sprinkling projects here and there + having extracurricular activities so we never get to study ahead for exams.
Soo... we’re giving our brain bulimia?
Songs? How about "There's Hydrogen and helium then Lithium..."?
Notice how it's all about memory, that's because schools only care if you can remember and not if you learned. Most people forget what they learned right after the test.
This doesn't work as an engineering student
Tests don't help you learn, it doesn't mean youve learned anything, stupid school system
Well I already had all exams today so this is kinda late for me...
watching this vid when exam has already end for me
Of course I have time to exercise when a big test is today!
Thought it said gram for an exam. Lol
All you gotta do is watch Bill Nye... and you’re set for life

I had an exam today and I slept at like 5 in the morning after studying and then woke up at 8 to read some more and gave my exam, surprisingly I wasn't THAT much tired😅😛🙃
In 40 min* :I
Can you do a video about how vans always land upright please like so they can see

You read my life when you said “you most likely clicked on this video having an exam tomorrow”
This would’ve been helpful last night
I have a math exam tomorrow 😆
I have my SATs tmrw wish me luck
This was timely
Here are a few ways to ‘trick’ yourself into calming down :)

1. Slow your breathing down, make sure to exhale longer than you exhale. This will slow your heart rate 

2. Tense for 5sec and relax your muscles, helps relieve tension

3. Splash cold/ice water on your face or hold something cold to it, slows heart rate 

They’re called the TIPP skills if you want to know more
The first one wont work on me. My bedroom, living room and kitchen are the same area, I live in a 129 square ft space.
Perfect timing
I only start studying 8-10 hours before an exam or test and after every chapter, I pause and watch some thing or go on a short walk. On the the final our , I drink alot of caffeine before I go for the exams and it always works
I have my exam in 28 hours and here I am watching AsapScience.
Perfect timing SAT’s next week
Can you do "what happens to your body when you have a panic attack"?
Just got done taking an exam unfortunately. Driving in stop and go traffic was not a good stress reliever...
Can you do an episode on why we cry when we chop onions??!
Can you make a video on why detention is bad
All the best to everyone else out there who didn't study all year and are hence here.
how did you know that’s what I was doing😩
felt personally attacked by this i literally have an exam tomorrow
Perfect timing
AsapScience coming in clutch
3:24 I remember that in my school where we had elevate which is when people come to our school and teach us things like how to save time and how to study like the u said using short term memory and long term memory.they also included that we have to exercise so we can study better
for some wierd reason playing computer games a night before an exam kinda helps me to score better
I literally have my exams tomorrow!!!
Just the video I need to watch, I have a math exam in two days

I have a business test and chemistry quiz tomorrow but im here
this video could not have come at a better time
Anyone else watching this instead of studying right now? 😂
I watch this video before every exam and then I do the same shit I always do for my next exam which is avoiding studying until the last minute fml
Am I the only one who's ever handed in a test and then 10 seconds later realized that I got a question wrong, knowing the answer?
Watching this during my exam
I’ve read “Gram for an Exam”
I thought the video was going to show us tips to really cram, but i don't think that's the case. I won't ever use the palace memory thing to cram, it's waaaaaaaay too loog. Super efficient but clearly too long. We need short term memory techniques instead.
Where were you when I need you for my finals last year?
Weird, I have two midterms tomorrow and I am cramming... And procrastinating 😢
It’s so weird that I did not study for my physics test , and I got 93% 🤓
Great timing i got an exam next week
Who here is watching Because you wanna get ready for an entrance exam
IB students where you at?
4:30 this is why I have a hammock in my apartment. Not exactly the most comfortable place for my back, but meh.
I wish i knew this before my essay test exam ......
This video came out the day after I crammed super hard for an exam, then ACED THAT SHIT. 😎😄 Sorry I haven't done this well in a long time I'm just proud of me
Who is watching when they are supposed to be studying?😂
Why am I here after every exams
Wait I thought u said

I had and extremely important exam yesterday and you posted this today :(
Engineering final exam in exactly 1 week.
Am I the only one that always crams
Was passing exams without studying. It was either i knew it or I didn't nothing woulda changed it
I needed this yesterday...
Sleep is for the weak
Its my exams tomorrow. Good thing this vid was made
I really hate that every time I study for hours a day, it doesn’t make a difference. When I wake up the next day, I forget everything and nothing even clicks. It’s as if I never even studied at all. What works for me is sleeping in the afternoon, waking up in the evening, then cramming all night and day until the exam starts. Everything that I’ve learned has been part of my everyday life, if I stop taking a subject I’m familiar with, I forget and never get any feeling of familiarity whatsoever.😢😡😢😡😢😡
Right in time thankyouu
The best advise I'd ever gotten from a teacher was not to worry about whether I got a passing grade but rather to worry if I actually know the material.  Focus on the knowledge, not the number
I could’ve used this a week ago.
Where was this video from you guys when I was at uni and needed it (aka 2012) ?!
Was watching in 2x speed
This vid came out 2 days after i’ve done my exams :/
And I thought it said gram for an exam
Bit late 😂 its mock week
Oh God, I have an exam tomorrow
Where was this video on Monday
j could have used this
I'm not in any exam, but I'm saving this for later.
How did u know that I was procrastinating?
Or...... you can just study and prepare for your exam
I have tests all week starting from tommorow and i didnt study...i hate myself.
I've got exams in over 6 months I don't think I have enough time
You couldn’t have posted this a day earlier...
This is so creepy bc I have an exam to take tomorrow and I’m cramming!
Any Indian students who have board exams???
I love that I did this last month. 😌
Another tip I have for cramming is handwriting all your information that you need to know onto a piece of paper + using Flashcards !
Just in time for midterms!
I got a 42% on my APHUG semester exam worth 50% of my grade, but it’s all good, it’s all good...I still ended up getting a B+ because we got so many homework assignments and I did them all. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. A B+ in an AP class is equal to an A so I still got that 4.0 I wanted. But you should probably try on your exams too. The more I study for an exam, the more I second guess myself so I get really bad grades. If I don’t study, I get an average of 78 because I don’t second guess, I just remember facts.
The fbi man knows what to put in my recommendations
Sort of makes sense now, my short term memory is terrible but long term is like replaying a video. I'm autistic so guess my hippocampus works differently to normies?
My exams ended today.. where was this video when I needed it the most 🙃
If you came here even though you have zero upcoming test, say "I".
Wish this would’ve came out before my finals...
Jokes on you I dropped out of high school
Best way to study is to teach others, try to learn as much in class and mimic the teaching to others
Proof that the education system tests your memory and not what you've learned.

when i study, i make a story with keywords and definitions in it, then on the test, i just recount the story
Great I finished my exam yesterday
Yeahhhhh this won't work for use in Engineering or CS programs....
Hope this will save my final for tomorrow.
Could you please do a video on how to fall asleep? I have a HUGE sleep problem where I'll take a nap either because I'm sick or I'm stressed or it's hot and I basically just fall asleep according to cat rules. But after I do take a nap, I'll not fall asleep even if I'm really tired. I have to wake up by 5:30 for school but I'm not falling asleep until 1 or later. Help?
Science has my back
3:35 asapthony scienthano here

This would have benefit me a month ago
Sometimes when i wake up in the middle of the night, i notice my brain going over the material i learned that day.
Ah this video was released in the right time
A day too late
Oh so don't get stressed? I get stressed trying not to stress 😥
I came here because I've subscribed you guys not because I have an exam coming in recent days

watching 10min indian science video, and professor dave right now
Great upload time! Two exams tomorrow 😲
I always want to take a break knowing just 2 minutes will let me do better but my parents say to take a break when i'm done, so it takes longer.
Reading the answers for the questions many times actually works for me (and then having people ask me the questions after I've read it a few times to see how much I remember)
I remember in elementary for band I used to use Every Gorilla Baby Devours Food lol
Great. I watched this after school. I had 3 tests today :((
“You’ve likely come to this video with a test tomorrow, or in a few hours.”

Jokes on you, I’ve already done my test!...

Advice to exercise while preparing for the tests - that reminds me of how i was pulling off an allnighter in Introduction to Zoology: running on a treadmill while loudly answering questions about different types of worms :D
I have not studied from grade 3 to 6,and i will never study because i know too much already
Wow he's right I have an exam tomorrow😌
You people are amazing 😍😍😍😍😍
this would've been useful last week
I remember in computer class I used to sing the keyboard keys as the alphabet and I always got an A (qwertyu, iopasdf, ghj, klz, xcvbn&m. Now I know my keyboard keys, next time won't you sing with me.)
I wouldn’t be able to fit into a cradle tho
Make a video on how not to get bored whilst revising

Watching this while playing fortnite on my play station
My spatial skills have been decreasing and my memory as well but the thing is I have trouble visualizing/ imagining things for an apparently reason like I can't think of pictures words nor numbers all blank I can't even see color for some reason not even black? It's hard to explain.
stop scrolling through the comments and study

Mood: watching this, should be studying, coffe in one arm, typing, not understanding, imma pull an all nighter, decides to do it early morning, never does it, what am i saying....dont like this or imma see this and be like wtf was i thinking at 2am?
WHY AM I HERE I NEED TO BE STUDYIINNNNG !!
Where was this during exams
By not watching this video probably.
I learnt the periodic table by your (asap science's ) periodic table song and btw it's music is can can by Jacques offenbach
Why did I read cream instead of cram
“You’ve likely come to this video likely because you have an exam tomorrow or in a few hours” you know me so well
I’m a fantastic test taker and I like to rub it everyone’s face
WHERE WAS THIS FOUR HOURS AGO
Golf it music?

MIND MAPS
Lol why this pop up on my recommended AFTER my exam....
I have a VERY SERIOUS QUESTION TO ASK AND I NEED YOUR SCIENTIFIC SKILLS TO SEE WHICH IS True!! Does threading your eyebrows last longer than waxing!? Or does plucking last the longest!? Out of all 3 what are the differences in science that lasts longer!?
I just had an exam where I missed 3 of the 6 weeks leading up to it due to medical problems, couldn't get notes from anyone I asked, and my professor only posts blank slides online. I got 65% and I am BLINDINGLY angry because I'm a straight-A student. I memorized all the material I had, so I don't see that there's anything I could have done.
I’m watching this to help me sleep, anyone else?
I use songs all the time
Why isn’t YouTube letting me know your videos are up? 😒
Indian boards  ...T_T
Why is t series in your comment section
the irony of trying to cram for my psych exam on the brain (limbic system especially) and getting a lesson on the limbic system thanks
I have my boards exam tomorrow
just in time
Just in time
My exam is next week....
1:13 - how i passed my periodic table test
Hm. So... I’m stressed when I’m at school and stressed when I’m not at school. But even though I’m under almost constant stress, I still am able to recall a lot when I take exams. Maybe it’s just how my body goes? Is it possible to thrive on stress?
Mind palace... interesting...
How about to NOT watch YouTube so you can study
Oh yeah STOP LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS GET BACK TO WÖRK!!!
1:12 Lady gaga has entered the chat.
The song "Fifty, Nifty United States" helped me daily when I was working for a company that dealt with travel agencies, which are numbered according to state, alphabetically.  Monty Python's "The Philosopher's Song" got me through my university exams in PHL 101.
Funny how I see this after my test today
Where was this 2 days ago
Realllyy want to know how much markers you use each year
Stop watching this video right now?
💙
Just study sequentially and concentrate on concept based subjects like Maths and Physics. Remembering the formulae is good, but if you don't understand the concept you're in deep hell. And you might use those mnemonics for subjects you purely need to cram through. But if you're a science student cramming won't help you much.
FINALLY
There isn't Arabic translation
I’m 14 years old, and I study so I can get a perfect score. This is what bothers me: If I keep being consistent with my grades, and if I mess up once in a test, people will start to downgrade and undermine me. Being an A student is not easy.
how do farts get triggered? Not what causes them, but do you get a certain mindset to trigger a fart? Or is it just a compulsive thing. I have laughed so hard that I farted before, but is that because of coincidence, or a natural trigger?
Who gets - F LOL
My a'levels are literally next Thursday
Oh come on. Just burn your book and drink its ash. Trust me it works.

My midterms were last week 🙃😒
my exam is just an hour away and i am watching this
I've got maths tomorrow!
Stop scrolling through the comments and GO STUDY!!
ma man
I....HAVE WASTED.....SO MUCH TIME.....RE-READING.
What about motivation? Lack of motivation vs laziness vs add? I've been in school 16 years (tertiary school now) and it never gets easier to get moving or to cognitively understand, in fact I personally have had a much harder time understanding what I read. Look at it, I know it's English, but it looks like gibberish/a foreign language.
Reread is imp ik
Haha is I don’t cram, I just write the notes on my arm and make sure they bland in with my Tattoos..
Only understood the word "Adrenaline" in this video.
I used to be severely depressed (I’m not anymore) but something has been left over. I think they’re anxiety attacks, but I’m not sure. What is the difference between panic attacks and anxiety attacks, and why am I having them? These questions have been burning in my mind for awhile now. Thanks!!
I only cram baby
2:08 why the school system sucks
You’re a day late...
Rhe third eye is the cheating eye
Who else sees a comment and says “I wish I wrote that comment”?
HELP! I FEEL STUPID FOR STUDYING??? I used to study a lot, especially before new lessons are introduced and before exams. But then I started hearing how my classmates didn't study at all but still got good grades. So i felt insecure and felt stupid because I needed to study at all. SO I STOPPED. And would copy off my seatmate, and share answers. But see, when I study by myself, I get even higher-- or sometimes even the highest grade? Is this like an esteem thing? Inferiority complex? A syndrome stuff? Help?
I've never been able to use a memory palace because I have aphantasia. It sucks.
Yo who else got a math test tomorrow
How did they find out that i have exam tomorrow
Thank you
Thank you

Memory palace....mind palace....Sherlock

Ok I'm done lol
I am watching this more than a week before finals. I will not study till the night before, and then excuse myself from cramming by saying, "Cramming is useless and a waste of time" and go to sleep calmly while my friends cram the shit out of the syllabus.
Yeah Tomorrow is my exam .. Nice Timing !!
I'm just finishing my exams and crammed horribly inefficiently ffs
I have come to this Video with no exams left. GG guys GG...
My exams are in in 5/6 weeks
Sometimes you don’t have a choice but to cram. I had Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Analytical Chemistry finals in 48 hours. I operated on 1 hour of sleep, took 3 cups of coffee and an energy drink to make it.
im about to be sherlock holmes
Well prayers are the best options for me 😂😂.
I have an exam day after tomorrow and I don't know what to study, someone help!!

Thanks my exams are within a week
I never caught onto songs for the colours of the rainbow, it only took seeing the initials in front of me as ROYGBIV as a funny word that it's stayed with me for life. Humour is a great tool for memory I find.
I have my 12th  board exam tomorrow 😅
Just give up
Imma pull up rn
I have an exam in one month so this will help me a lot
Just eat some cramberrys
That one about re-reading notes... my problem is I haven't read them to begin with, so my study has to involve that at least
grand chase music? or maplestory?
My exam is literally tomorrow and I'm totally blank . I still have 12 hours.  Let's see what can be done . Thanks for the vid btw 😅
Just a day before my history exam.. and I haven't studied anything so thanks I'll go cram now

Illuminati Spotted.
Very nice, it really helped 👍👍👍
cheat

No significant differences doesn't imply no benefit for re reads, it only implies the hypothesis isn't supported by the experiment.
Dear ASAPscience,

I am disappointed with this video. I am a researcher in the Bjork Learning and Forgetting Lab at UCLA. This video disappoints me because it’s so oblivious to the truck load of research that has been done on learning. Sure exercising is great and metacognition is cool. The more important thing should be knowing how to encode the information into your brain effectively. I suggest to talk about Interleaving, spacing, Pre-tests. All video about studying focus on the before and after studying, ignoring that there is research on the During. I would start by looking at some Bjork papers( no just because I’m in their lab ). I apologize if I come off as big headed or demanding. I just really care about the subject and I truly admire your channel for being so educative while keeping it entertaining. Either way, thank you for doing what you do.

Best Regards,
Josue
Hey you! Get off youtube and go back to studying!
0:07 well, I actually have vacation 😂







So you're wrong, asapSCIENCE
I've used the CPF method from grade one and it got me to grade twelve for those that don't know the CPF method 
Cram
Pass and
Forget
Thank you soooo much!!!!
How did you guys know I was craming for an exam?🤔
I'm joke, let me think of an early....

BUT, is memory recall actually learning anything? I can use my phone to access the internet and grab any piece of information I don't recall. About twice a semester I tell my students "You need to memorize this".
Exam in April
I got a test in 8 mins
I have my midterm in two days. This couldn't have come at a better time!
I'll have to invite a girl over to help rock my bed before my next test

I got a statistical mechanics exam tomorrow lol
If only this came 2 weeks ago when I had exams
When you were smart enough to get through high school but you get to college and don’t know how to study fml
This video came just at the right time.
It is all fun and games to make memory palace for one topic. When the n number of topics from 19 subjects pile up. Your memory palace ll be a garbage you ll never visit.  Only way to memories a lot of things is revision. Experience from med school !
I have exam tomorrow 🙄
just learn to study goddamn kids
i never crammed or studied for a test i was always of the opinion if i don't know it now im not going to learn it the night before. i always tested well well except for spelling but as a dyslexic, i never understood why it was important particularly when Americans seemed to spell and say shit wrong  its aluminium, not a loony mum i don't care that your mother is crazy you shouldn't  be making cars and drink cans out of her (ceases sarcastic rant about Americans not understand elemental naming conventions ) aluminium is an element not an alloy so aluminum suggests by its name an alloy which aluminium isn't. as people promoting science you should use scientific terminologies like the metric system rather than a system based on dead monarchs appendages or a temperature system that some German guy just pulled a number out of the air and said: "im about 100 degrees ". you might you don't want to alienate  people but if you run a class so the dumbest kid can learn then nobody learns
My last name is krebs
Nice
I WILL NOT try to learn the afternoon/evening before an exam unless I am quickly looking over a diagram or something. If you don't know it by then, you won't memorize more than like 3 ideas for your short term memory. The only thing studying before an exam will do to you is get you confused because you can easily misread something last minute as you're skimming your notes and this will only lead to worse performance on the exam.
I belong to the opposition party, which is called life. ×
Who else has an exam on 7 March?
Thank you so much being in college is stressful.
Is The great courses plus available for indian students?
My method:
0. Set n=1
1. Write down all the stuff you don't know or understand from lecture notes, books references etc on paper (paper stack n) with a pen.
2. Read through what you wrote (paper stack n) and again write down stuff you don't know (on paper stack n+1)
3. Increment n
4. Repeat step 2 until you have a half page of stuff you don't know.
5. Keep that page with you.

Worked every time for me :)
I always cram for exams😂
I don't study/revise because I just doesn't help
Men don't procrastinate. They just do at last minute.😂
Finals coming in 3 weeks, this will be needed 👍
I have my first exam  in 11 hours.
I'll also reprobate ;-;
Gram for an exam
Tomorrow is my exam

Sort of on point. Perfect timing.
I'm so early, I can't think of a funny comment
Thank you for this, I think I'd like to try these tips once I stop procrastinating!
Where was this two weeks ago? But thanks... wait did I ask for this video?
Try coming here 30 min before your exam... 🙃
Not sure why I am here. I already dropped out of school
Anyone else thought the thumbnail said “Gram for your exam”?
We all love cramming.
Usually I just place my elbow into an old mouldy bag of bread and go to my Exam to pass
Great tips, just what I need right now. Thanks!
This channel is really great 👍

Please see my videos
The highest cause for death is living.
Rip to the 432 people who died while I was watching this video
No matter how I'll die, the question is where I will respawn
Studies show that 100% of people who drink water die. Coincidence!?
Narrator: “The death rate amongst children has dropped dramatically!”

Antivax mom: “......*smirk* fool...”
Planet Earth has the highest mortality rate in the Solar System. In fact, 100% of deaths occur on Earth.
That was a very good video! All facts, and straight to it.
Air causes death.
Must. Not. Breathe...
Pfft- if anything will kill me, it’s myself...
Hey, if you're watching this in 2250, I'm dead
Y’all should have used the ‘<‘ sign instead of ≠ at 1:34
Hey, can you next time make a video about the overuse of antibiotics including for people and farm animals?
100% of deaths is caused by dying
Knowing that many kids under the age of 5 die really made me sad.

sometimes when i think of DEATH, i always think what will happen AFTER the DEATH.
Is it Heaven?
Is it Hell?
Or is it infinite sleep.
I always get chills when thinking about the  sleep? 
No dreams, no nothing, can't feel anything.
Is anyone thinking about it?
Edit : Also, thinking about you can die in every second, just, gave me even more chills....
Bold of you to assume I can die.
Humans need 2 hearts (or at least a backup system to keep you alive long enough to get to the emergency room)

Question- What if our population were to double over night. What happen to the planet. Also what pros and cons would happen due to the sudden change. Would people over populate the planet or could we think of a way to save both the people and the planet. From things such as pollution and or maybe an increase in violence?

Be careful when driving yall 😁❤
Is the fact that the most common cause of death being influenza a century ago at 2:57 relatively incomplete, considering 1918-1920 was the reign of the Spanish Flu, the deadliest flu in history--or was influenza also the most common cause of death in the surrounding years, with the Spanish Flu just adding to the death toll?
Be more specific in titles bruh
i was a premature baby, but im still alivee
Life hak:






Then don't die
This was uploaded on my birthday
looking in a mirror?
This is I question I've been pondering. It's not really something that you would usally do but I want to know if people feel the same way. 
It seems a lot of people on social media have depression or anxiety. Is this becuase of my search history, people wamting to fit in the crowd, all the depressed people on social media to make them feel better or something else?

(sorry for spelling mistakes)
"1.8 eight people die every" .8 ????

Clickbait level = out of this world
Let’s test to see if it’s accurate ;)
What if life is just a battle royale, and when we die, we respawn in a new life.
Mixed up figures: the number of deaths attributed to cancer was 5.7 million in 1990, so 8.9 million in 2016 was actually 3.2 million more (+57%), and not "5.7 million more". The increase of +57% does match the multiplied increase in world population (+41% over these years) and in life expectancy (approx. +11%), but the correlation is not proven. So the question "Why has cancer increased so much?" probably needs a deeper scientific analysis than throwing figures on a canvas. But that does not invalidate the message: try to live a healthier life.

2:20 We don't have mosquitoes in my country. Guess I'm cheating death!
This is definitely interesting, makes you think... 🤔
Maybe oxygen is killing you slowly and takes 60 to 80 yrs to fully kill you
I can't die  because I don't have a life jokes on you asap science.
You should do a video on how meat affects the body :)
Can't die if you're already dead

If heart decease will kill me than all I have to do is not contract heart decease.
Can your vids be a bit less USA-centric? If your number of non-us viewers justifies it, that is (and I have a hunch that it does). Great material as usual. Cheers.
No.1: My depression
You didn't say eight not fair now I dont know how I'm going to die like
If you wanna be a medical researcher or something like that just remember, the money is in treating diseases, not curing them
Crazy. When a van drove into me I was 24 and it was a Friday. Science. 😂
wait why does his voice sound like a roller coaster
1.8 death pre second how dose 0.8 of a person die??
Did you know that 100% of people who have died of cancer have died on Earth.
Did you also know that 100% of Fortnite players live on Earth.
Coincidence? I think not.
Fortnite causes cancer.
The title in short is about my ex.
Ironically sponsored by gates... I'm sure he wants to kill 99% of the population
I the end this video was just clickbait.
What about all them kids eating tipods?

Math 100
Wait how can 1.8 ppl die per second? So.. I person and an 8th?
I'm honestly surprised that the most common way those within the 24-44 year old range was accidental poisoning. I would expect it to be homicide or even suicide given the way mental health is affecting us much more often and with dramatic effects
Remember, 
1.8 people die a second
chair and a rope
my channle is dope XD

Clickbait? I think so

In 2020 I might be alive
Can we please acknowledge the fact that Alcohol, Caffiene, and Sugar can all be classified as "drugs". If you mean illegal and/or prescription drugs, please say so.

Anyone else worried about dying ;)
the BIGGEST cause of death is not living
Just about to go to bed and watch this, im gonna be up all night having anxiety attacks thanks :)
Moral of the story we are all going to die
dying is the main reason of death
You're just using induction when you claim I'm going to die, right? With that logic, if it rains, it should keep raining forever. But it doesn't.


So, I plan to live forever. Best part is, if I'm wrong, I'll never know.
Sponsored by bill gates WTF, YOU MUST BE RICH NOW
You guys never answered why has cancer increased. You only told us the statistics and not the actual culprit :o (Im not talking about biological level) 

Could be in another video but I probably forgot
I literally just ranted about how trumpets can kill you. It can be a cause of lung cancer 




I wrote a whole essay on this in only five minutes ;-; its 12 am and this is what I do
Or, Y'know suicide
Bill and Melinda Gates !! Hum that's a pretty good sponsor...
0:53 - Have anything to back-up that assumption?  What makes you think it's not diet, the increasingly toxic chemicals we put in our stuff, or even the technology that makes life so convenient?
NOTE:  It's been proven that wireless communications technologies cause cumulative damage that leads to cancer.  And the higher the operating frequency, the more damage is done and the faster it's done.  Also, a healthy diet of antioxidants has been proven to prevent cancer.  We are a lot more deficient in these nutrients than we were 30 years ago.  In addition, the foods we eat are pumped to the brim with toxins that cause cumulative damage over time, which leads to cancer.  That's not to mention the various toxins that we constantly touch and pump into our atmosphere.  But "cancer research" (which only pretends to find cures for cancer) would be non-existent if we fixed the problems mentioned above.  Nice try though.
 - Vaccines contain mercury, MSG, aluminum, and other neurotoxins that cause severe brain damage.
 - It has also been proven that malnutrition is a cause for infertility, premature birth, and other reproductive problems.  Maybe a primary cause that "science" won't look into because there's no money involved for patents.
Wait how do 1.8 people die per second?
And what about Europe?
I'm gonna comment and never reply. You'll never know if I'm still alive or dead.
Thanks asap, im so fecking paranoid now.

Hey! My first big accident occurred on a Friday wouldn’t you know? And if I hadn’t been wearing my seatbelt, there’s a good chance I’d have been thrown through the passenger side window and crushed by the car as it rolled on its side and righted itself.
But I was wearing a seatbelt, so I walked away with nothing more than a ruined car and a bit of whiplash in my neck and shoulder. I recovered in about 2 months. Oh, but I was also 28, so out of the age range.
"Who knows how we may die in the future"

2070 news report:

Introducing the death of the future:  new research conducted by NASA scientists after the incidents regarding the moon in 2045 showed that traces of a new super-heavy-element 'scuicidium' was left in the moon crater. This element can be used to target individuals who's neurons emit a low will to live. This attracts a bolt of energy similar to a lightning bolt to strike the individual, killing them painlessly and instantly, leaving no corpse behind. You don't even have to say a word, NASA will kill you for you if you CBA with life.

The death of the future is here.
This Will most likely kill you (if you are american, 🤷 the rest)
Who knew Bill and Malinda would be so morbid 😂😂
86400 -seconds in a day
So
86400x1.8 is 155,520 <- And that’s the average amount of people who die each day

So if you take that and divide it by the amount of people on earth you get 0.00002074 which is your odds of dying every day
What an optimistic video...
This will most likely kill you: anti-vax parents
Congrats on the sponsorship!
BADA BING!
Hands up, who got an existential crisis watching this?

Haven't watched video yet. Assuming i won't finish it before i die. Goodluck everyone else.
Just making small talk. I got poison. What about you?
I'm okay with dying
My breath will do it faster
2:37 I assume that wasn't the intended meaning, but that word order is really bad (and if you like black/dark humor also hilarious)
I’m surprised they didn’t mention texting while driving, it causes a lot of accidents
1:09-1:34   Build that wall! :D
The most likely way of you dying is by being alive.
Life is the worst disease.

It’ll take to long, anyways.
Questions marks, the deadliest of all
20 years old and I track/race my car. Well... at least I'll go out while having fun!
Wait ... I'm gonna die?!
im 28 so i have to stay away from listening to trap music and ill be fine!!!
We need to stop the drugs that are poisoning our country. I mean seriously...more deaths from drugs than two major wars combined?! Either we need to make drugs go extinct...or overdose the addicts more quickly until there are none left. Either way, this needs to end.
The main cause of death in the future
Will be stupidity
NO matter how safe our planet is
We will always manage to kill ourselves
Everything can kill us basically lol
That moment when you're thinking if someone died while watching this.....

Every time I watch videos like this I feel entertained yet sad
Conquer this channel!!! Oh yeah yeah army
Bill and Melinda Gates 🤗🤗
Thanks... I guess
At least when I die I’ll respawn in my bed
Yet another amazing video. As a content creator, I highly admire your videos. Keep up the great work!

I thought the most deaths caused in teens is suicide.
My mother has malaria and she's not dead.
Live life to the fullest and without fear  because you won't make it out alive
So 2017 was just a shatty year
There are way too many ways to die! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That’s factually incorrect on why we get cancer. 

In 1900’s your risk of cancer is 7% ur lifetime.

Today is 56%...

The reason is because people eat sugar and glutamate which are the only oxygen/food source for cancer. 

My reference are doctor Otto Warburg finding in 1923 that cancer cells can’t live on ketones and he won the Nobel prize for it.

Plus, Thomas Seyfried is conducting research in 2018 how when you put a patient on the keto diet, take the drug NOD, then eat one meal a day, your stage 4 leukemia will easily vanish.
wait i may be dumb but how does 1.8 people die per second
please do a video on aphantasia
Just a fact about me. I smoke 3-4 packs a day and I don’t have lung cancer
I heard ligma deaths increased over 500 times since ninja died from it
My greatgrandfather turned 100 years old this month😬😘
When the cause of death for your age range is something you can't prevent. 😱😰😷
Interesting but very messy video. You mention causes then leading cause of death for some brackets in the US. This lacks consistency. Pity
Axiety warning?
So I'm most likely to die of Malaria...


Ok.
Everyone has to die. Doesn't matter how everyone is gonna die.
d i e d e d
Did someone misspelled unintentional?
Knowing T-series is going to win.....,
We will all end up in the ground...
This video is so depressing, but I still don't think I'll ever die.
The malaria VAX won't help soon
I thought I was going to die due to sleep.
Where u go after death? Maybe worht some time to think about
1:59, did u just assume there's 2 genders?
Well this sucks. But great informative video! I somehow find it...better to know, it might help people be more aware.
Why didn’t u include the actual number of overdose death??? Is it a secret???
I dont care what Bill and Melinda Gates think.
1.8 people die every second... So 
.8 of me can die
Time for my daily dose of existential crisis.
Doubt it....
In other words teens have low iq
he sounds stuffed up
Not if I live off of a Machine
That car crash one really got to me. Two of my classmates (one I used to be friends with and one that I joke around with) just got into a really bad accident at 16. One guy was speeding at 80mph and a deer came into the road. They swerved and his car wrapped around a tree. They both played soccer. One’s leg, arm, and nose is broken. And the other broke both of his legs. They will never be able to play soccer again.

It’s so so terrible 😭 please drive the speed limit. And please please wear ur seatbelt. I hope both of my friends can recover. I hope they’ll make it
Will I die eating paper 😦😧😨😰😱😳
Well this is depressing but educational!
ASAP, why do males get the pee shakes after one finishes peeing?

Nah I won’t die because I HAVE THE FULL VERSION OF LIFE. You all have the free version
Wait how can a 8th of. Person die??
WE WILL ALL DIE ONE DAY...
But I live in Europe

If you could find out when you were going to die or how you were going to die, which would you take?
this video is giving me anxiety
when will they run out of markers...
I don't know about cancer increases being due to us living longer. There are numerous things shown in studies that raise the risk of cancer. Life style is hugely important.
Vegan so not applicable ;)
We all die lololololololololololol let's make memes until we all die
Drinks gasoline

“Think I’ll die?”
When they talk about malaria and you remember you're unvaccinated
I bet u they both had an A+ in science 🧬
Loneliness will kill me
Humans will not “die” in the future. All these causes of death are easily preventable.
Leading cause of death from 3-12 is stepping on legos
*anti vaxxers have entered the chat*
Ligma is the most likely to kill you.
15-24 is weird because 16 years old is the minimum age for a drivers test
I stopped watching when I found out it was funded by Bill and Melinda Gates. There is no more evil a sponsor you could have. Hard pass.
Im most likely to commit suicide
If driving is the leading cause of death for people my age, I guess my various physical and mental health problems are keeping me alive then.
Nah it's fine if I die I have a bed
Great, now i'm even more scared to drive
🤔 murder is the number 1 cause of death for pre birth babies
insert "guess I'll die" meme here
None of this applies cuz I live in Canada sooo
am I the only one confused to why you first explaned the reasons of death in the us and then later only world wide? I'd like to know the leading cause of death for kids under 16 in thr US... don't think it is malaria.
thanks
BREAKING NEWS: DEATH RATES INCREASE TO 100%
How can 1.8 people die? A person and eight tenths of another person?
Ironically, the guy at 3:36 reading the Gates newsletter is using an Apple laptop.
Did you know 100% of all people die?
Gamers don't die they respawn
How can 1.8 people die each second??
Why do chicken nuggets taste good?
for ages 1 to the possible oldest age for a human being, you're most likely to die through shaggy sneezing in your direction at 0.1% power.
I GOT YOUR BOOK!
Opioid overdose deaths are rising as over 202,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses between 2002 and 2015, and more than 70,000 died in 2017.1 Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of 50,2 and chronic use accounts for 20 percent of the increase in male unemployment.3 

Narcotic pain relievers place an enormous economic burden on society, costing an estimated $504 billion each year.4 As noted by Dr. Tom Frieden,5 former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “We know of no other medication routinely used for nonfatal conditions that kills patients so frequently.”

Despite these risks, including birth defects and risks of addiction, nearly one-third of women of childbearing age are prescribed opioids,6 and more than 14 percent of pregnant women are prescribed opioids during their pregnancy.7

In April 2016, the CDC published a paper noting opioids have not been proven safe or effective beyond six weeks of treatment.8 “In fact, several studies have shown that use of opioids for chronic pain may actually worsen pain and functioning, possibly by potentiating pain perception,” the paper states.

In the most recent turn of events, a Massachusetts state court judge ruled to release an unredacted version of a complaint filed in January with the attorney general’s office naming Purdue, eight in the Sackler family and nine others currently or previously associated with the company as defendants.9
Purdue Pharma Seeks to Expand an ‘Attractive Market’

The Sackler family are owners of the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma and have a combined fortune estimated at $13 billion. The family received nearly $4 billion in profits over the past decade from Purdue, in large part due to the burgeoning sales of OxyContin, an opioid developed in the early 1990s and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995.10

The opioid class of drugs also includes morphine and Fentanyl, as well as illicit drugs such as heroin. It's also been recently reported in the Financial Times11 that the Sackler family owns Rhodes Pharma, “one of the biggest producers of generic opioids, which never before has been linked to the family.”

This company was launched only four months after Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty in 2007 to charges of misbranding with “the intent to defraud and mislead the public,” paying $634 million in fines.12 This is 15 percent of what the company paid the Sackler family over the past decade, and from their actions, it's clear the company has not changed its ways.

According to documents from the claim in Massachusetts, in an effort to continue to profit from addiction, Kathe Sackler and her staff identified millions of opioid addicted people as their next business opportunity. They identified eight ways the company's experience in getting patients on opioids could now be used to sell treatment for addiction and wrote:13

    “It is an attractive market. Large unmet need for vulnerable, underserved and stigmatized patient population suffering from substance abuse, dependence and addiction.”
Man thinks he will live then die then simply turn to bones yolo, correction just after the leaves die then the new season arives and it regrows and Allah promises to do the same to your very soul and bring you back to life from your very fingertips to your toes
Nah we will all die of ligma

Life is but a dream

Those people between 65 and 69 will never die
as soon as we are born we are dieing
Praying for people on the internet who died of Ligma
Please make a video on Modafinil
Wow the Gates foundation called you up to sponsor your channel. That's an honor.  I think you are wrong why cancer is increasing. It's because people eat more and more processed food and/or junk food. It's no coincidence that as the number of obese people increased the number of cancer deaths increased.
UMMM 666K VIEWS?!?
The Gates foundation is actually funding that Malaria trial, which is interesting. Love that they’re not only targeting one of the biggest causes of death, but spreading awareness in an easily digestible manner.
Wait, how do 1.8 people die every second?? Does one person and half of a body die like a stroke? I'm confused...
3:25, lol just kill the baby after its born like in NYC
Neonatal means premature babies...incase yall didnt know

Death is the







Final destination.
I love you channel thank you so much and I’m also happy for you and your bf💛
AGHHHH IM AT RISK
Jesus or sin people choose wisely!
Honestly the leading cause of death for teens is probably suicide, with the depression crisis, it’s bound to take the lead at some point
Statistics are globally and societally telling.
you should do an experiment using your fans have them send something in to a lab and make a video on it
How does .8 of a person die🤣

Well, that's a massive spoiler.

“Still alive but I’m barely breathing”
Living long is the leading cause of death.
Can you please test of students learning in class. Student A didn't listen to the teacher when student B do. Of course at exam times A will study hard since he/she don't know much about the lesson. And student B feels like knowing the whole thing and study a little. Which one will get a higher grade?
So i will be more likely to die of filping malaria?!?!
1.8 people die each second......so what happened to the other part?
If u think about it, we all die from heart failure
0:45 Cause the government is putting shit in our food and wants a decrease in population
Wait how does .8 of a person die every second?
How tf did they get bill gates to sponsor this video
This is too deep😓
I was shocked that one of the leading causes of death wasn’t suicide
Well that was depressing.
I thought this was gonna be about how we're all going to die in the massive drought and resulting collapse of civilization caused by global warming within the next few decades.
Malaria. Great
Your home bed was missing or obstructed
I already know how I’ll die! Suicide
I cant wait to die sooo. Yay

Malaria vaccines are being tested
Cmon man why you gatta remind me of death
Abortion is the biggest killer (all ages). Abortion is murder btw.
Wait so this is sponsored by bill gates?
I thought the answer was time.
Im gonna miss those .8 people the most
I actually have this fear, (since I’m always listening to music) that I’ll be listening to a stupid song when I die or God forbid a song not by Queen 😎
432 people died while you were watching this video
1:03 you have some spelling mistake covered up. Did you smoke something while making the vid because that also could kill you.
That's not the reason for a rise in cancer ! Sleeping fool don't push the gate's propaganda ! He's openly admitted to wanting depopulation SMH
Can you please make video on what is opioid?
Bruh 2017 lil peep died with drugs that's weird

I'm most likely to die in a car crash or from malaria. Great.
Hopefully i die soon
How do you make your videos?
Its the anti-vaxxers
Death is a transition, not an end, people are so tight desperately in life that they forget the whole purpose of it
You forgot to include a gender perspective, a lot of women are killed by their partner or ex-partner, in some countries this is the main reason of death for women under 45
It's weird that this came out yesterday cause I got in a car accident yesterday a I'm in the age group 15-24😂 (it wasnt my fault tho)
1.8 people die every second, that 0.8 is people dying on the inside
Several people died in the making of this video
I'm from South Africa 🇿🇦

Yo guess what it’s my birthday

I felt bad for the people who died while I typed this.
You forgot about creepers
The number one cause of death is dying
it is not healthy to worry about death . just live your life
Isn't aging just a "bug" in our DNA? I've read somewhere that for example lobsters don't die of old age but because they just keep growing so after a while their body can't keep up anymore and they die. Really interesting..
4/5 of a human dies lmao.
its 11pm at night, why am I watching this
Stop drawing round earth please ! We all know it's a lie
I thought for age group 25-44 when they said Africa I thought they would say Ebola

I want to know why has there been a sudden increase in childhood autism (ASD). I seem to know a lot more people now with ASD children, than the 80s or 90s.
Not if I do it first.
Self

1.8 people die per second. Just how much is 0.8 people? Or is it 0.8 person, since it's less than 1 person?
This will most likely kill you if you are from the US
Wait how does 1.8 people die how does eight tenths of a person die

Looks like I'm safe.
Let me suggest an idea for a video: Depersonalization and its triggers (different drugs, disorders).
If we reincarnate into humans again don't ants reincarnate into ants and have an endless cycle of being stepped on or drowned or even being burnt to crisp with a magnifying glass.?...
Ahhh life is such a fickle thing, all those lives, all those people, dying all the time all over the world...

2:58 that’s because of the spanish flue
7 days and 50 percent of deaths occur in roughly half of these days. How is this useful at all?
I’m scared. I’ve been having an existential crisis for a month and even though I’ve had them before, I’m becoming paranoid of my decisions and health to an extreme. I have a lot of fears now. Woohoo

I heard death was going to kill me, is that true??
15-24 is INCORRECT it’s Suicide
‘Overdosing fatalities’

Can we please address suicide? Can someone just say it? Because it’s like we’re pretending it’s not really there.
Once I read the tittle I was thinking Mosquitoes

Luckily I don’t do drugs.
I’m pro-choice when it comes to abortion rights.
well we all are busy dying, sadly
Dear super amazing person reading this, 
    I hope you have a super awesome day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be happy about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always hope. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be happy, laugh, smile! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone loves and cares about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
   I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. I'm not doing this for myself, I just wanna spread the joy to everyone. Maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cuz i just wat to make everyone happy:)
Early
To be honest I’m probably gonna die by putting on pants 👖
I’m surprised teen suicide didn’t make the top chart😔🙏🏻

how does 1 8th of a person die?
I would’ve thought the leading cause of death for teens would be suicide because of how much more depressed everybody is now. I guess not. It’s kind of reassuring to know that..😬
Hey guys, small suggestion. Can you guys please adopt dark theme? This video is blinding during night-time binge watching.
Let’s play a round of would you rather

1. Have ebola or malaria?

2. Get sick from Ecoli or salmonella?

3. Fall of a 100 feet building or drown in the middle of the ocean?

4. Go blind or lose your sense of hearing?

5. Heart attack or stroke?

6. Polio or cancer?

7. Bully someone so much until they commit suicide or you get bullied until you commit suicide?

8. Coma or brain trauma?
Deadass thought you were gonna talk about suicide in the teenage years.
If you’re reading this you are alive
Time to get Malaria
Overdose is really hard to do. The lucky ones that get to are in heaven.
I’m gonna die because of myself 🗿 stressed depressed and pressed
Rip voice at 0:57
What if I die twice???? So if I die twice does that mean I will be be alive cos in math - + - = +
Why do the gates wanna remind us we are gonna die?
what about canada
weird, i thought 15-25 would be like suicide or something and 5-14 cancer
434 people will die while you watch this video.
I didn't die. Lame.
Watching this when it has 666 k views baby
Who else got really bad anxiety
As a 25 year old who is already struggling with elevated blood pressure, I assume I will die of heart disease at a relatively early age
Guess by age. I’m somewhere in between Unintentional Poisoning.
or... i could just do it myself...
What happens after we die? Will we see just complete darkness and will we not be able to do or think of anything for hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of years? :((
Tuberculosis.
Is it normal to watch killing videos on youtube or liveleak? I dont fantasy or adore killing anyone but its just fascinating to watch police or soldiers shooting a bad guy or the otherway.. It just makes you think knowing that the killed person is no more.
do you know boogie woogie?
How does the 0.8 die?
Death is a good thing
Zombie deer
Can u guys plz do what happens to your body when u get psychosis
My grandpa died from drowning in lava
Please report all values as rates, not quantities
i wish i was dead before i was born
Nah imma kill myself
That malaria vaccine has efficacy of 30-50%. I don't think things are looking up that much if at all
ГОЛОВА, ДАЙ ДЕНЕГ
I want Bill and Melinda Gates to segment and compare how people die based on the wealth% in the population.  Do the richest 1% of the population die for the same reasons and at the same ages as the poorest 50% of the population?
Oh we are going to die? Well I’ve heard this 5,000,000 times so thanks for the heads up
if longer lifespan is causing cancer related deaths then shouldn't people over 70 years of age be dying from cancer and not 44-64 years old? Cancer rates are cuz of we are interacting with thousands of chemicals  everyday. There are dangerous chemicals in everything, especially in fked up non-EU nations like USA, China etc
1:38 I live here...
Midgets dont die, they can respawn.
How is there a 0.8 of a person?
Moral of this story : You could've already died so please shut up and be friends

0:45 cancer has increased because of bad food. People used to eat only organic food, but now that food is mass produced (using chemicals to help food grow, etc.) . Many people don't know that bad food leads to cancer because of corruption in food industry. Scientist are getting bribed to not tell the truth :D if you don't believe, look it up. Also if you know anyone who is pretty young and has/had cancer, just look what they have been eating
I'm on the good path to heart disease
If you’ve met ninja there is a high chance you will get the ligma disease and die

Thanks

The leading cause of death in the world is time, except that abortion is over 91 million a year.
This is a bunch of crap
Anyone else click to see how to actually die? lol
I hate your videos because you use too many markers / uneven objects as letters
I am premature...
Am I the only one who came in the comments section to see if anyone commented on the fact that they said 1.8 people die everyday?
Actually...Wouldn’t 12-18 be suicide???
Time will kill us all
Actually the leasing cayse of death for people aged 15-24 is suicide
How do 1.8 people die...
I want us to live longer but I also know its a reality that overpopulation may be a problem so I’m not sure if I’m all for the goal of saving lifes
Its almost always in our genes like if cancer or brain issues lead in our blood
Abortion causes the most  death
Where is depression? :)
Great video!
Aaaaaaahhhhgggg my legs
How do 1.8 people die , one person and 1/8 of a person dies or something
In the future, a leading cause of death in children will be the direct result of not being vaccinated.
Is this video is sponsored by bill gates? Really? But how?
Every sec die 1,8 peoples??? do you mean 1?
it also depends where you live too guys...u should mention "how you will die in 'US"
@AsapSCIENCE At 2:10, what does the 2x male death rate mean? Does it mean that males are just twice as likely to get into a car crash and die, or that they are 2x more likely to die, given that a car crash has occurred?
I want to die
Just bc my kids r gone doesn't mean they're dead, right KAREN?
I think getting hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs is how I would want to die and that's the only death ill accept
Oh my god (no pun intended) 43308 people died during this video...
heart disease is also usually caused by eating too much processed sugars, sat fat and cholesterol, so avoiding those can greatly help your chances!
I really hate future because future means close to death and close to the end of the world
I’ll probably die of cancer at a old age
And unvaccinated kids?
Almost 40 people died while im watching this video.
Abortion
I thought the top cause of death in teens was suicide
“We’re all gonna die” isn’t bad news tbh
How does 0.8 people die!?!?!?!
Well I guess im going to walk for the rest of my life and if I get heart disease time for sewer side I don't wanna put my family through the trouble of hospital bills and paying for treatment just to see me die in the end.
Why does America give driving licence to 16 year olds :/ they are still kids
sponsored by bıll gates mean is unlimited money
OOF
121k died from watching this video
surprised anti-vaxxers aren't the leading cause of children dying
Disliking this cause of Bill Gates
UR SUPPORTED BY BILL GATES??? NANIIIIIIII
You cant die if you're not born in the first place
Leading is Cancer because people don't know how to eat
Anyway you're gonna die
100% of the people who watch this video will die!
How can .8 of a person die??
Less ppl = Better world, no matter what.
My sister died when she was born AND NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BROTHERS AND IM THE ONLYGIRL
I don’t live in the US, why am I watching this???
No u
What about abortions
Kinda surprised that there isn’t a one where it is 13-15 due to suicide
1.8 million or thousand people?
“We have some bad news, you will die” ok so what’s the bad news
How not to die
If you believe God exist you will have EVERLASTING LIFE (John 3:16)
So what were the casualties of unborn babies a.k.a abortions or miscarriages???
Was hoping you meant the video. I don’t have enough money for a noose
I mean.... Is it really bad news?
how does .8 of a person die excuse ne
I don’t care how or when I’ll die I just wanna know what happens next
Pollution, poor healthcare and over population are the biggest cause of deaths today.
Im only 14 but sometimes when Im on my bed I like to lay down, look up my ceiling, and wonder what happens when I die. I get anxiety sometimes thinking about not knowing and I get frustrated trying to explain something like this to someone so Im on yt to see if anyone else got the same situation
So the u.s. is cancer? I can agree.
We all gonna die some day, you either get killed or kill your self.
1.8 people die a second. How can 0.8 of a person die?
I misunderstood the title hehe, ithink the following things you write in your will will likely to kill you(by somebody)
How does .8 of a person die?
I thought at least one leading cause of death would be suicide
I'm 29 and I'm almost positive I'll die from either cancer, heart disease, or some physical bodily harm. Reason being, I don't smoke,  don't drink, I don't do any form of drugs. But I do eat, I love to eat and try new, flavorful foods. So my heart is at risk here, especially since high blood pressure runs in the family. Cancer, well... seems like everyone gets some form of cancer at some point right? What makes me so immune? And bodily harm cause... well... how can you honestly prevent any and every possibility of this being your cause of death? You could be driving on a highway next to a cliff one day and a boulder just silently comes and crushes your car without warning.
Now you just need someone to trade eyes with a death god to tell us when we will die
Ummm I’m 10 years old
This is the reason why I'm going to leave Brazil. The chance that I can be murder is very high. =/
Heart disease due to poor diet. Eat your plants ✌
This video is a joke. A bunch of garbage info, meant to bring out all the hate for anti vax. Meanwhile bill gates, the sponsor of the video sits back and creates artificial meat in his laboratory, and gives our kids autism. Bill gates belongs in Guantanamo with the rest of them.
1.8 people died every second..
Heart disease?
Uhh.. 1.8 people die per second? I'm probably just being stupid but how does 0.8 of a person die?
Help I don’t want to die
Is it true that if you dont wash your hands SUUUUUPER good after touching raw 🐔 chicken you get really sick and die
I wonder if there's statistics for cause of death and Logan Paul subscribers.
I’m gonna did!?
1 of 26 children die under the age of 5 whatttttt did i hear that right?
At 3:18 you say 15 million are born premature, but the text says 15 million premature deaths.
I bet records will show that 2019's leading cause of death for children under 5 is gonna be Measles...
But..... 1.8 people die every second? What the hell is .8 of a person. Why not just round the number
I’m 13 why am I watching this
I think I will die of cancer
How does .8 of a person die
438.8 million people died in the time it took to watch this video
What if you live in a area where there’s not really any mosquitos?
how does .8 of a person die
Will I still die from heart disease if I eat healthy food everyday?
This video is a lot different compared to current day, with abortion legal, baby deaths is way up
Scientists found the cure to cancer but they are not telling nobody how. Don’t come at me.
~Video~
1.8 people die each second

~my brain~
Thanos snap
Phew thought it was shot in the face
Now children will die because they are unvaccinated
1) Being a cancer scientists
How does 1.8 people die in 1 sec??
I'd hate if one eighth of me died.
i’m surprised suicide wasn’t on this list
Textbook are becoming obsolete, but teachers everywhere are still going "You need book sources, online articles are no good and stay away from Wikipedia"
1.8 people die does that mean if 0.8 of me is dead what is the 0.2 % of me
I laugh at this I am 12 years old and I have sickle cell disease and I an immune to malaria  because of some science stuff.
Going vegan is the best thing you can do to the planets, animals and yourself. You can probably avoid dying of cancer, stroke and heart disease by going vegan (you should also not drink too much alcohol and stop smoking).
I’m surprised that they didn’t mentioned suicide
I’m never gonna die!
Fake news malaria is not the major killer it’s turberculosis not malaria
For me, suicide.
Where is suicide on this list
If we cure cancer the world will become over crowded and natural selection would almost be none existent in the population.
I have a question, with the fact that dinosaurs grew so large because they came from eggs and mammals stayed smaller because they're born alive, THEN WHAT ABOUT PLATYPUSES?!
in teenagers suicide is big also
From where do you have these informations? From books or maybe some interviews?
Thought suicide would be on here
100% of people from earth had died. The Earth is not safe, we need to leave. Donate to my the gofundme to leave this planet.
where’s suicide on here?? cus tbh i feel like suicide would be on here
I'm allergic to mosquito bites in a way they are swollen and have red around them. I'm 11 and the way I'll most likely die is a desiase caused by mosquito bites..
Hope more people die and the world population will decrease
Why isnt suicide on here?
I really don’t want to get malaria.
How does a 8th of a person die... You said 1.8 of people per a second die a second
I will die thanks
Video : "This will probably kill you"
Me : CLICKS ASAP
I'm 12
🏳️‍🌈⃠ 🏳️‍🌈⃠ 🏳️‍🌈⃠ 🏳️‍🌈⃠
Could the numbers of death increase be to the aging of baby boomer and that the ratio is relatively bigger as well. This along with an increase in technology in identifying cancer. I wonder if this is incorporated? Any thoughts?
Eat healthy and be happy
cue to all suicidal people
How terrible is it to be immortal? You see all of these shows talking about immortality, but what would happen to or bodies if we were immortal? What would we wittiness? Would we work on curing diseases that cannot make us die? Would the diseases become so unimportant that we turn a blind eye to It? What would the world look like if that was possible? How would we solve our wars? Anyone know the answer?
what about the 9 months inside your mothers womb whats the leading cause of death? irresponsible parent?liberals? or that your parents simply dont feel like you deserve top live because of mistakes they made?
Guud
Itsa me malario
Press F to pay respects for the .8 of a person that died
For anyone on the fence about spending their time reading the Gates’ letter, do it. I very much enjoyed it and it really made me think. Thank you @ASAPScience and Bill and Melinda!
WAIT WHAT THIS IS SPONSORED BY GATES?!???
You forgot to mention police brutality and injustice
how tf does an eight of a person die
Be ready to change this video quickly! The statistics will change
@1:34 the equasion  is not wrong but ‘<‘ instead of ‘≠’ is better
Just let people die! There’s more than enough people!
my great grandpa just died so that’s a big oof :/
Did you know dying is the leading cause of death?
Global warming shall kill us all
Its my b day
Good to know imma die in a car crash lol
Hit me baby one more time.
But we got to remember death is the best way to help with overpopulation and is important yes it’s is sad but what would be worse is to live in a world where no one has every thing they need to live
1.8 people, so basically a person with 0.8 of a body? Ok I'm bamboozled
What is one 1.8 people supused to mean is it like 1 and 8/10 of a person
Spoilers!
Sucide
u wot
0:07 at first I was just thinking "HOW THE HELL CAN YOU HAVE 0.8 OF A PERSON" 😂😂😂😂
Who thought that when I clicked this I would die
I did
Wow dude thanks for anxiety 😺👍
Love the old timey toilet such a gentlemanly facility he is. I'm sure his flush is discrete.
We've had 3 people die this school year because of car crashes. All in HS
Must be true XD im 20 and I broke my knee in a car crash last week
0:06
Like duh
all the top executives for Purdue  should go to prison for at least 20 years
lol ok
Texting and driving when ur gf wants to break up
As a person with Lupus who has to take anti malaria drugs twice a day, I think that's the one thing I'll never have a problem with.
What does it feel good when you do something naughty
Increases in cancer will be microwaves, pesticides, pollution, foods with preservatives,  overall increase in radiation from the 2000+ nukes that countries have set off since nukes existed
ARE WE JUST GOING TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT THEY GOT SPONSORED BY BILL FREAKING GATES!!!
So the cancer death rate has gone up 8.9 million people since 1990? Thats 26 years. The average lifespan has gone up what, 0.01% percent since then? The rise in cancer fatalities is prob the stuff they are putting in our food and air and medicines
720 people died during this video
Funny thing is heart disease is the easiest thing to prevent on that list. It's all about diet and exercise.
.
GEY
You did not mention that people die because of school. 😏
Heres some asap science

The more you post,
The less i wanna die
Answer:EVERYTHING
"1.8 people die a second" HMMMMMM 🤔🤔🤔 how does that work HMMMMM 🤔🤔
Just the video i need... Hopefully I'm gonna die soon... I'm 21 tho
We know already, life kills us. What else is new : P
What is the background music?
What if u get murdered...
Why did I watch this alone at night?
Isn’t it weird thinking that some people who are subscribed to this channel are dead now?
Living will most likely kill you.
okay i clicked on it... im waiting..
I don't wanna go...
0:03 wtf that's great news
can you guys do a video on borderline personality disorder??
sponsored by bill gates
1.8 people die each second? You mean 2 people die each second?
Haha Aids
You forgot to mention unborn children!  They are most likely to be murdered by there own sick parents and the government supports them.  Abortion is a horrible way to die. You need to all grow up and stop murder not your choice,  not your body.
The leading cause of death in the USA is really sad




Abortion
Fun
Wait! So, wahmen are better drivers than us? I dO NoT BeLiVe iT!
Could you please share some of this research for Europe as most of it is for the USA 😃
So because I can't drive and don't have a car, could I be immortal until 24?
Well the real question is, is the probability of dying in a particular age group higher than proceeding into the next age group
What percentage of people die from natural causes (aging)
I sure it will be the nuclear bombs heat wave that will end my existence. Sad thing is that i wont be able to feel it because it ends me before i would be aware of it.
Oh I thought this was going to be about how our planet was dying
So you're telling me because I was born premature AND my mom was sick when she gave birth to me I could've easily died?
Oh boi
1:33, you used the wrong symbol. you are saying that the casualties from the death toll from drugs are greater than those of Vietnam + Iraq combined. But the symbol you used means the casualties from Iraq and Vietnam are not the same as the death toll from drugs in 2017. You should have used the ''>'' symbol.
Who wouldn't wear a seetbelt? Like it's common sense to make sure your wearing one
we will all die??? omg
how does 80% of someone die bwo
Tell the textbook fact to my professors
Well, I'm 27 and in two years probably I'll be dead due to my Duchenne musclar dystrophy.  :) 
But actually that doesn't bug as the fact of I'm gonna die a single virgin. I mean common girls disabled have feelings you know. :(
You forgot falling out of the world
0:05 yay
These bills are going to be the death of me 😑
Wait 1.8 what people?
2:40 What!? 1/11 children died in 1990 before reaching the age of 5.!? I'm gonna guess it is a statistic for children specifically with neonatal disorders.. And even then it seems way to high! If it is indeed for all children, then I would very much like to see your source..
Cancer
100% of death is caused by dying
Congrats on being sponsored by the gates
So while watching this video people are  now dying holy shtt.. one day we will be in that time too..:"( good luck to your life everyone:)
sponsored by bill gates?!?!?§|§
Future death causes, regardless of age: corporations.
tbh //i'm thinking of suicide long ago ,  and soon i will do it , but all i need is the right weapon
2:45 Its NOT Vaccinatable Diseases?Great!
NOOO! I’M GOING TO DIE??! Why did no-one tell me?
How do you crash when you are 15?
the biggest trigger of paranoia
I honestly would have thought the most about of teen deaths come from suicide
Guys, 1.8 deaths every second just means approximately 9 deaths every 5 seconds. There’s no “0.8” of a person
LIGMA
In 3:20, why does he say that 15 million babies are born prematurly, but he writes 15 million premature deaths?
My grandpa died due to a car accident. Either it will be that (horrible driver), cancer or suicide. But maybe I'll choke on a donut- it would all make somewhat sense. I'm not afraid- better, and worse ppl have died before me ;) they made it too
Да похуй. Мы уже внутри мертвы.

Came here to give you a thumbs down for a click-bait... you deserve it.
More more more!
Can the moon ever fall on Earth?
Like so they can see this!
1.8 People will die per second. 
So does that means for ever dead person, another person is half-alive?
I wanna die high off of drugs too🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I call BS on this video.
DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR
What should we do in an earthquake?
one every 26 newborns dies????? doesn't seem right in the slightest
How do 1.8 people die
Today I will die of malaria and tomorrow I'll die in a car accident, I love science!
Interesting video! It makes me want to learn more about how to better avoid heart diseases. Also, this is a problem with the lack of educational books and the higher count of e-books: I'm less prone to retain information and to learn efficiently when it's about reading it on computers for some reason. Maybe it's my habit of enjoying physical pages more, or if it's from a bad factor provided by monitors. I would love a video diving into understanding which way is better to learn.
Jesus, death toll from drugs has gotten pretty insane. We should legalize more marijuana, good job...! Idiots...
At 3:20, shouldn't it say 15 Million Premature Births to match the voice over?
I didn't see abortion listed 🤔
Well I'm 28 and don't do drugs so I'm good until the cancer or heart disease gets me!
Abortion will be number one thanks to liberals!
I know that i will commit neck rope someday
Find thanos 😂
Thanks.. Now I'm more scared to die now...
I've never clicked so fast
I swear they uploaded this video months ago
432 People died during this video, RIP
Unpopular opinion: I actually don’t want to live up to my 90s becoz I might not be comfortable with my body deteriorating all the time. Idk just a thought
We will all die sooner than we all think👌🖖🤘/\⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️⬛️
ironic that this was posted on my birthday
Good to hear that most people in Europe don't die
Its more like, if you died this is probably what killed you
My husband’s cousin died in a car crash at age 16 after just getting his license. This is pretty accurate.
Drugs are population control we need it
Has there been an effect on mortality rate of children due to the anti-vaxx trend? It would make more sense and its basically a meme now.
Adds are getting smarter.
3:40 the old traditional eastern pit latrines are way more cleaner and make sense. In these S-bowl toilets, your pee would be all over the place even on your feet
So, the US, you say?
this will be handy.
How was your day?
Dihydrogen monoxide is the leading cause of death worldwide. Anyone that eats or drinks it, dies. It is a waste product of nuclear power plants, and is found pretty much everywhere. Fix this crisis before it's too late
How is That bad news?
2:36 wrong..its antivaxx moms..
What if I’m a feetus?
Y'all need to stahp makin' kidz
Good video as always, thanks. 

(1) Heart disease by bad cholesterol by animal products and stress. (2) Cancer also highly effected by animal products. (3) Drugs are dangerous, duh. (4) Motor vehicle accidents highly effected by sleep deprivation (and drugs and our ridiculous ways to move with too heavy or human-controlled vehicles).
1:41
That actually makes a lot of sense, since guns are banned there.
1.8 ppl die each second how??? Lmao
What do u mean 1.8 people?
Where is that 0.2
I am 34 right now and fighting against an aggressive form of cancer since 2017... right now I would be really happy if I will be able to live until between 45 or even 64 like it is said in the video ^^ (yes I know it is "only" statistics)
0:49 but lifespans have decreased since the birth of this country
im sorry how does 1.8 people die every second? whats the .8?
Haha lol! I know that I’m going to die from suicide!
1.8 people dying every second is an average.
Nice video but mosquitoes not mosquitos. There's sad times for us who will die of sadness due to bad grammar.
Read the letter. We people who are able to be here on youtube are so lucky.
I’m 15 what the hell
When you want to dislike a comment but because you can't you report it as spam
I don’t wanna go...
This video pushes death culture and war culture and population control. Nobody has to die, our bodies are overstressed by pollution and die prematurely
About 432 people died while you were watching this video
All we GONNA DIE well








SUCH A GREAT NEWS TO ME
For 5-14, the most common way to die in America is from a school shooting






I’m joking
All this is science stuff is evil, the reason y ppl are dying is because god has other plans for them
You guys are absolute madlads for uploading this today
straight facts. Time heals people. You will find love again.
I wonder how many "cant get over an ex I never had" comments this video is gonna get
“Almost everyone experiences romantic love in their lifetime.”
Okay ouch
Just go to the gym and make you ex regret.
Can’t have an ex if you’ve never been in a loving relationship. 😎
In other words overdose on Tylenol and cut your ex out of your life got it.
Welp I got dumped today so happy Valentine’s Day y’all
It's all fine and dandy until you have 5 out of 7 classes every day with your ex.
This is how I got over my heartbreak:
1. Lots of time. Time is great to do activities in.
2. Doing a lot of activities and creating memories. The more activities and memories you build, the more distant the memories of your ex will be.
3. Remove all the other hard things in life. Breakups are hard because life is hard. Make your life easier during the break up.
4. Realize that being single is just as awesome. I'm serious. Being single can be so peaceful and full of freedom.
3:24 omg don't play with my feelings
I can just imagine all the 10 year olds that think that they are in love.
Or another option: never get into a relationship
It’s like you’re stalking my life... why’d you have to upload this today...!?
Just block everything and delete all the pictures. That usually does the trick.
the problem is ... she was perfect 😔
“Ha! Jokes on you, I don’t have an ex😂!”

Dear super amazing person reading this, 
    I hope you have a super awesome day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be happy about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always hope. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be happy, laugh, smile! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone loves and cares about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
   I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. I'm not doing this for myself, I just wanna spread the joy to everyone. Maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cuz i wanna make everyone happy:)
I know how to get over my ex, but how do I get under my ex?
Isn’t it amazing? When people die you always wish for one opportunity to talk to them again. 

Yet in a break up you go from talking everyday to none at all; the person is still alive and the only things standing between you and the phone is pride or some form of logic.

Just curious on everyone’s take.
Why am i watching this? I don't even have an ex...
1:50 "a leather seat"

THEY FRICKEN MADE A REFERENCE TO CARRIE UNDERWOOD
Can't wait for some "you cant have an ex if you've never been in a relationship" people
ASAP Science: “How to get Over your ex”

Arianna Grande: “First time?”
One word. Weed
Wow that was weird, 
As you said we broke up I almost immediately started to cry, even though you said just kidding right after it. That beings me to a question. Why do I cry at these kind of stuff, where I don't " really" know the person who is affected. Is that because I have a lot of side memories related to you because I watched all of your videos so I subconscious bind with you. And it's probably being amplified by the fact that you share some personal stuff, like buying a house together..

Maybe this can become a New video, "why do we cry when something happens to an Idol"
Can't have an ex if no one loves you!
modern problems need modern solutions.
This is




 day 
i broke up with my ex and started Nofap. Today is day 403.
This came out at the right time 😖
Can't get over you ex if you don't have one.

Insert "fingers pointing at the brain" meme.
This video doesn’t apply to me. Single Squad!
who else almost died when they said they broke up?
Wish I had this 6 months ago lmao
sobs
lmAo....
everyone; Can't get over your ex if you don't have one
me; 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you so much for this video, was already following some of the steps lol, thanks anyways
Next one: how to come over the pain if being single 😂
Watching it while feeling that my gf will break up me soon 😂😂
I’m sending this to my best friend AND I KNOW IT WILL HELP HER OMG PLEASEEEE
Their animation looks different. Damn when last was I on this channel😱😰!!!
YouTube doesn't even suggest it anymore🙈
First viewer from India....🙈❤❤🔥🔥





Happy valentine's day...🔥🔥❤
Could you make some more technical videos to help with GCSE / A Level ?
Broke up with my ex over a year ago and it still hurts thinking of him. I am dating a new person who I do love but I still love my ex and miss him. I just ended up making peace with the fact that a part of me will always love him.
Asap science: “How to get over you ex”

What I see: “How to get over my none  existing ex”
Happy Valentine's Day...
I was thinking about this, but couldn’t you get addicted to the feeling of not feeling bad if you took Tylenol every time you felt sad after a thought of you’re ex? And possibly even love the feeling of not feeling bad so much you got addicted? I feel like if more people knew this, there would be a lot more drug overdoses or dependency because of the sense of relief you get from that? 


I think that’s was understandable I could be wrong 🤷🏽‍♀️
Uploaded on February 14...
really??
Now make a video about how to get a girl/boyfriend
Flat earther, anti-vaxxer....

I don't want that person even for a day.
OMG I HAD A LITERAL HEART ATTACK WHEN YOU TWO SAID YOU BROKE UP
My stomach dropped when they said they broke up 😂
Me: sees title of video. Clicks it

Me: watches 


Even more depressed that I'm single.
I just got dumped a couple days ago. How did you guys know??
Exactly what I needed
AsapSCIENCE uploads this vid
"Almost everyone experiences romantic love in their life time"


The keyword is ALMOST.
3:07 OKAY HOW ELSE TO I SIGNIFY A QUOTE/SARCASM??
3:06 Flat Earther lmao.
MY HEART LITERALLY STOPPED WHEN YOU SAID YOU BROKE UP!

Omg, don’t do that. It’s not good for our heart.
Actually, i clicked this video to forget my crush...
Perfect time to upload such video
Absolute perfect day to upload that video
This video’s music makes it sad lol
Love a cynical valentines video
This video is so well timed for me! 😂 Thank you!
You can't get a Ex if you never date anyone
"because we broke up" 😱💔💔
"joking" 😌
😭 no he didnt come far me stop lurking on their medias💀 I do what I want
Just before valentines .....great!
Could you make a video on how to get an ex so I can use this info?
I can confirm most of what you presented from a recent breakup (caution: I like your videos so I may be victim of my confirmation bias). The only thing that I have to strongly oppose is one of the last sentences "[...]and move on to the next one." I find it helpful to think that there may not be a "next one". Maybe at some point, but for now I prefer being my own "next one" and learning about my own flaws and how to love myself (which may even help if a different "next one" actually comes into the picture).
Stop joking about breaking up!
You two can't break up.
Never ever.
Yu two are the sweetest couple I've ever seen ...
Haven’t gotten over my ex for more than a year, is there a general psychological tip to help me move on?
Keep in mind, I’m Bipolar
I’ve been broke up with my ex about 4/5 months now and still have feelings. 

Anyone any tips or felt similar before?
Way to give me a heart attack at the very end there!! But this is really informative. Since so many people go through break up I would always try to end them via the distraction method so that's nice to know the 'true' results from it and what is actually a better way to go about helping, thanks! Happy Valentine's Day!
U2🍇🍉🍌🍍 better NOT break up I love ya'll together....thank you for this vid #perfecttiming
My heart fell so hard when you "siked us." Not nice. 👍 stil... but don't play with my emotions.
Scare me like that!!(with the breakup joke at the end) 
You two are my favourite YouTube couple
they posted this on Valentine's day I'm SCREAMING
This is what i needed omg thank you
Never clicked on a video so fast
I can't thank you both enough for uploading this today, I really needed this
Wow, he broke up with me yesterday (day before Valentine's). YouTube already knows 😅

"Im so grateful for my ex, thank you next."
Oh...Today's Valentine's Day?
Wait you guys are dating?

(r/woosh)
I dont have exes
Me: am single never dated anyone
Me: see this video on recommended

You guys got me for a split second with the end card 😂
Y'all had me gagging when you said you broke up for 2 seconds, jesus christ
Step One: Get an ex...
Thx for uploading this today.  I needed this.
In the great words of Ralph Dibny...
3:23 my heart broke there for a second! You can't just do something like that 😢
Holy frick i thought they broke up for a sec😰
What is an ex? Ex military? Are women even real?
STOP! My heart sank when you guys said you broke up :( but i'm glad you guys didnt haha
I've been drinking a lot today.
Who's in a happy long relationship but got hurt one time and got curious 😂

To people who never had an ex to get over with:
You're not the only one
I've lived for 17 years on this planet without being in a relationship, so can you.

You'll Survive
Y'all nearly gave me a heart attack at the end DONT JOKE ABOUT THAT
As someone who is likely somewhere on the ace/aro spectrum, thank you for saying "almost" at the beginning!
How to get over your Ex 
1: self love  
2 : distraction 
3: friends and family 
4: Hotel? Trivago
Please people don't take Tylenol just for that reason
Move on from your ex girlfriend... ‘cause I’m bored.
Well, that's the only problem I don't face...
Nah the memories pulls you back...how can u leave someone u love and adore so much for so long ... man  like how
You scared me for a second at the end...

It was worse than Laurex
“Write down as many negative qualities of your ex as you can think of.”

They wrote anti-vaxxer😂😂 made my day

I'm so lonely
this came at the perfect time; God bless you, ASAP Science
“(Tylenol) may help mitigate your desire to say, carve your name in his leather seats” 🤣🤣 I see what you did there. Does Tylenol also prevent Louisville slugger to both headlights?
Useful video as my now ex cheated on me today, on Valentines Day!
Awesome man thanks a lot for this love u ❤️
Breakup vids on Valentine's Day? Geez..

Lol On valentine's day brutal
Negative aspects: flat earther
WHEEEEEEEEZE
Thank you so much for uploading this, I actually really need this. Now I know what move should I make:)
I'll comeback to this video after getting into a relationship first 🖒
Can’t have an Ex if you’ve never been in a relationship.
Bruh non of this has worked for me so far. I've tried everything I Stull can't get him off my mind some how
i should have known before stalking him on social media
Well. Happy Singles’ Awareness Day 😂🥰💀
Thank God for commitment issues  🤣😎🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
You guys are awesome! Love AsapSCIENCE
my boyfriend literally broke up with me yesterday this is perfect
Yeah, I’ve had an ex. 

E: I’ve always been single 
X: and probably will always be but I hope you have a good day nontheless everyone
What if you work with them? 🤦🏽‍♀️😔
Ah I'm already over him. Yay. 🤘😊🤘
Now I finally know if you're dating or not lol BUT I love how you used "antivaxxer" as a negative lmao
I just broke up with a date. : |
How much of a coincidence.
WITH A CAR
heartache is truly one of the most wonderful time for personal self growth.
Joke’s on you I never had an ex
Hhahaaha😬ha😑ha😰
I watched this vid on Valentine’s Day just out of curiosity...
Who knew I was gonna get dumped a week later 😔
Like it was a premonition
"So we made this video cause... we broke up" me: WHAT?!?!?! "Joking!" 

geez louise dont do that to me
Talk about interaction time of a current partner please, thanks.
this helped a lot. Thank you!
TIME is the only way to get over an ex.  You can only move on quickly if you never truly loved your ex.
But if it is REAL love we are talking about, then the truth is this;  You are going to be devastated......absolutely shattered.
It took me 3 years to recover when my fiance left me.  I am now happily married to a wonderful man, but I wouldn't wish a broken heart on my worst enemy.
I can't have an ex if I'm lonely. 😁
Heh , how can u get over your ex when u dont have one 😎😎😎🙄




(Forever alone , gif)
And I just got back together with my ex today.

Turns out I  never got over him and he never got over me...
What a life!
I just broke up with my gf.
And this video.
Thanks bruh

 : LOL SHE CAME BACK TO ME GUYS!!! 
HOLY MOLY! I AM SO EFFING HAPPY
I never had to get over my ex, like the rest of you suckers...

Cause I never had one for 17 years so far.
This came out literally 5 days before I broke up with my girlfriend
I don't even know why I watched this, I'm single Af!!!😂😂😢😢

Where ma' single squad at???
Dang y’all !!!!! I really thought y’all broke up!! Those two seconds when you said that y’all split, I got soooo sad 😞!! 
Glad y’all didn’t.  😃
recently broke up with my ex and this comes up for me..... lmao.. we will all be okay here. 


follow me on instagram tho : TRILLMATTICXX
Happy Valentine’s Day Everyone ❤️
Thank you @asapscience this really helped
I needed this. Thank you.
Yo you could've posted this 4 years ago! Lmao 🤣
This video is very interesting because this methods might work as well for a friendship breakup, not only a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship only. 
I had to use all of these techniques a few years ago and they really work.
Have a nice day everyone!
When you said that you broke up my heart stopped. Don t do this to us ever again!!!!
What if you keep dreaming of them? How can I stop my dreams?!💔😭
People actually creep their exes social media?? I blocked mine from all my social media while I was still living with him after we broke up haha 😂😂😂🤣🤣
Thanks a lot greg and mitch. Love you guys ❤
Lmao i just finished watching You on Netflix and I think Joe could’ve used this video😂
I don't even have an ex
Make a video on how to get a GF
3:06 IT SAYS THERE A FLAT EARTHER AND ANTI-VAXXER 😱😱😱
It's nice that I won't have to deal with this because I'll be single forever



I'm very lonely
Omg you made the ex bf bisexual :')
I so needed this 2 months ago! I'm starting to recover now. I will follow these steps too so I'll be able to move on effectively. Thanks ASAP Science!
Guuuuuys! Dont do this to mee :D I was casually doing my night routine while listening to this video, when I heard -"we broke up" I swear I have never glanced so fast at my phone! Took me by surprise 😂
I needed this, thank you.
Why do we have Hiccups
"flat earther" and "uses air quotes" had me on the floor
my lover (laptop) broke, me sad, but i got new one
Is no one going to mention the "carve your name into a leather seat"? A Carrie Underwood classic. Loved the reference!
bro when you said “we broke up” i had a heart attack
My ex cheated and left me for a close friend, 3 years wasted. She now struggles through life as her man got both of them into drugs and he is in and out of jail, sometimes I feel bad for her, but she made her choice. My wife and I are going on 11 years of being together and have two beautiful kids
Cant be crying over moving on if you have class A amnestects 
Happy LonelinessReminder Day everyone!
You can't be heartbroken if you've never fallen in love 🤔
"anti vaxxer"
yeah, dont want that in a relationship
Thats all why I never wanted a realationship
Thank you for this. I broke up with my ex in September, and this is the first time I've had such a hard time getting over someone, including my marriage. So this really helps.
Broke up on valentine's day :)
Bruh Moment: Why couldn't you have uploaded this earlier, lmao
Been watching this series for years and somehow never picked up on the fact that you 2 were a couple. lol.
Omg that one second they said the were breaking up my heart stopped 
I have no idea why I am so invested in their relationship
I hope Mitch isn't trying to tell Greg something with a video on breakups
My girlfriend and I legitimately broke up the day after you uploaded this
Generic comment about not having a Significant Other :')
Thanks for the video. It gave me a new way of thinking!
Isn't it the perfect day to upload this video!
Broke up with my boy friend. I feel happier than what this video suggests and more confident
Damn it, I needed this vid like 3 months ago

Just got dumped today. Very sad. Thanks for posting this I actually feel better
What I need:
How to get over being single
My heart stopped when you said 'We broke up'. No joke.
Can definitely agree this video is pretty accurate
am I the only one who gasped when they said they "broke up"???
Thank you... your the real MVP
What if you don't have friends? Asking for a friend
If Greg and Mitch broke up, I would be devastated!
The paracetamol/tylenol structure is wrong. You messed uo the amide group 🙃🙃
You guys push Tylenol. You deserve to go to hell.

Sincerely,

My morals, ethics, and intestinal lining.
To think that this video was released on Valentine's Day.
You guys are amazing, I love you 💕
Good video 
3:05 Antivaxxers & Flat earther!!!
You guys are the fuckin best! I'm listening to the Love Song next!
Could you overdose on Tylenol, if so how many tablets.
You cant have an ex if you never had one ;)





Simple problems require simple solutions....
When he said they broke up I almost had mini heart attack. lol
0:01 "almost everyone" 😓
Don't EVER joke about you two breaking up! 😲 My heart broke for a sec! 💔
I needed this. I just broke up with my ex but I want him back but not really.
Niggaz actually got me 😭😭
This doesn’t feel so much like science as it’s all completely subjective.
All excellent strategies  men.  Thank You and may I Never again need them for myself .
I needed this right now. Thx
Ariana Grande taking notes
no offence
Could not have timed this release better. I really need it esp since 2 of my exes messaged me the other day ugh
now I'm going to try negative reappraisal.
About two years late but still needed this 🙃👍
Ugh my heart sunk at soon as you said we broke up I was already tearing up and then u said joking 😑😑
Any chance you could do a video about the thyroid and hypothyroidism in general?
My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday
These guys are one of the very, very few couples-I've-never-actually-met that I would be genuinely sad about if they ever broke up.
I actually got dumped the day this was posted
2:58 Now I see why they broke up
Good thing I'm single
She was going to be my first Valentine's but she left me
Just listen to:

 The Reason- Hoobastank 
Let Her Go- Passenger 
No Ones Ever Gonna Love you- Band Of Horses

Guarantee you’ll just have her in your thoughts all damn night.
I literally felt my heart drop when you said you guys broke up literally my feelings are so hurt and I’m regaining all sense back ,,, oufff thank you for causing a 2.0 second breakdown ,,, all in all I love your videos together so so much !
On Valentine's LOL..Happy valentine's day omg im so happy for you guys(im straight af XD)
Just got out of a 3 year long relationship. Broke my heart, appreciate the upload lads haven’t been doing okay with it haven’t been in contact with her. Love the upload :)
ASAP Science: “here’s how to get over your ex”
Me: NO 😡😡😡😭😭😭🥺🥺😡😭
I experienced a horrible break up because my ex cheated and I found that listening to break up songs really helped. Also Feel good songs like JLo’s Feel So Good, Stacie Orrico’s So Simple and Corrine Bailey Ray’s Put Your Records On made my mood better everytime I felt negative or spiteful towards my ex. 
I lost a lot of weight in a span of 3 months after the break up and I tool advantage of it by shopping new clothes that definitely made me happier and more confident. I was over him in a month even though we were in a relationship for 3 years! I suddenly realized all his negative traits were there all along and I was thankful that he finally showed his real self to me. I moved on so quick that just after 3 months I was dating again. 6 months later I married that man and next month we’ll be celebrating our 7th year anniversary. 😁
It’s all good until you see him over half the time in school ✌️
Damn ASAP ya'll didn't have to come @ me so hard. I told you I was working on it.
Today is valentines day?....
Oh... that's why she was so mad and ended it all.
Did no one else notice that carrie underwood joke 

Wtf that was fire yall
My heart skipped a beat when they said they broke up 😂
Well David is not getting over Liza anytime soon
This is such a good idea! I hope this helps people out ^.^
Step 1. You end the relationship on your terms.

Step 2. Reap the benefits of independence and freedom.

Step 3. You will get lonely and date someone again. Repeat Step 1.
NGL when you said you guys broke up even in a joking way my heart stopped and I felt sad!
Listen to Thank you, Next🖤
Block donate/throw whatever they got you delete pics. DON'T FALLOW OR LOOK THEM UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA! This works.  Stay focused finda hobby work out dance whatever.
This is so shady. This is exactly what I needed 😩😩😩😩
So now I get the notifacations??!!!
Thank you for telling me
Thank you, I needed this
GETTING OVER A CRUSH IN EZIO'S WAY. HIRE 6 MORE COURTESANS TO SLEEP WITH HIM UNTIL HE FINDS THE TARGET'S WIFE/EX AND MOVES ON WITH ADULTERY.
Oh my god, my heart shrunk for a second when you said your broke up, don't scare us like that!
Bold of you to assume I've had a relationship
My heart dropped when you said you broke up, like actually dropped
How to get over your ex?

Ariana Grande: “thank u next!”
I don't know why I'm watching this, I'm single. 
You just knew what I needed right now, thank you for uploading this video. I do have someone i have to get over right now so this helped a lot! ✅
Happy Singles Awareness Day!
how many times do I need to jerk to pictures of my ex while crying before I get over them?
You guys just about made me cry in the half of a second you made me think you broke up! 😭
I love how they start off with "almost everyone experience romantic love" thanks ASAP.
Ahhh science it never fails me thank you I finally decided to break free from a toxic relationship of two years .
OH MY GOD, DONT MAKE ME THINK U BROKE UP
You guys GAVE ME A WHOLE HEART ATTACK when you said you had broken up oh my god
Listen to aesthetic music
Workout
Hang out with friends
Make yourself happy in any way
Don't show any emotion when with/near ex
It’s crazy cuz I just went through a break up with the love of my life then I see this
Thank you, i need your video right now!
Yikes. Valentines Day?

Can you make an episode about tickling?
We were never together yet I still can never get over him 😪
the song on the background is giving me massive life is strange max and chloe vibes
POSTED THE DAMN DAY AFTER I BROKE UP!!!!!!!
i dont know if an FBI agent is listening to me through my phone or whatever but Im literally crying rn bcos of my ex and then i scroll through youtube as a distraction so i can get myself to sleep and stop crying and this thing shows up 🤦🏻‍♀️
This is my first single Valentine’s Day in five years so I really needed to hear this right now. Thank you!
A year and a half by ex won’t leave me alone, thank you for this. Imma send this to him.
Social media stalking actually helped. I got to see what shit he turned into. I showed my 11 year old his pic and said “This is my first boyfriend.”  She replied, “Eeewwwwww!”
I just realized. you guys voices are very calming! 😌
How's one can moveon, if the other partner is always physical present very close to the former, e.g. in long Courses like MBBS, it's just 1st year n there r gonna be 4 more years🙄🤔
Not exactly what I needed, but thanks
Everyone else: how do i get over an ex
Ariana grande: thank you next
im the reason he had to say "almost" at the beginning :(
Bruh I need a tutorial on how to get a gf then have her dump me
My ex dumped me three days after I told him I was pregnant, now I have to deal with him till our son is 18.
3:06 had me weak 💀💀
i literally got a heart attack when you guys said thet you had broken up!! 😖 How could you make such a joke!? 😭😆
3:01 flat earther lmfao😂😂😂
Scooby got waves!
The anti vaxxer and flat earthed part had me dead
When they said they broke up I almost cried omg not funny😂
Start watching TV series on Netflix..
Tylenol has also been shown to reduce empathy.   It basically makes you dead inside LOL
I will remember this if my boyfriend leaves me. Thank you guys.
Reccommends this to me on Valentine’s Day ☹️
Awe the fbi heard me crying ❤
If you click this, it will turn blue. 😱
👇🏻
Wow that's crazy - I broke up with my gf yesterday and you posted this. 
Thanks, guys. I'll try focusing on bad parts... but the only one I can see is that I'm addicted to her so much and it drains me or smth...
I didn't know they are a couple, how nice. :) <3
3:06 Flat Earther lmao.
This couldn't come at a bether time. Today my girlfriend left me >.<. 
That's one way to celebrate valentines day.
I wish I had this with my ex. Well, at least I have it for the future. Hopefully I won’t need it because I will get married and live happily ever after. 

What!? A girl can dream! 🤷🏻‍♀️
On Valentine's day aswell😂😂
Your content is really getting lane and dull. It saddens me deeply that your videos aren't interesting anymore
AT THE END I ALMOST CRIED

3:05

I still see your Shadows in my room
After watching this , lemme just take 5-7 Tylenol.
You're the boss for this year Valentine's day

Jump over them like a Unicorn
🦄🦄🦄
My boyfriend of 3 years dumped me a day before Valentine’s Day.... thank you for this
Pain changes people! Get back to work

Like if you want to  be  fearless
I liked my comment,I want to be fearless
I've always wondered how not liking to read is seen as a negative aspect......
you have soup
Just divide by x 
Ez
Greg and Mitch are my favourite straight couple
You can't forget if you don't have 😂 I'm single from decades.
Are you single too ? Let's see how many are. Happy singletine Day.
Hail the scientist who performed all these wonderful researches !
How does that marker still have ink.
Joke's on you. You assume i could get a girlfriend to begin with
Make video 'Science of time'
This video made me think about my ex so I just had a Tylenol #thxasap
I just become friends with them a few months after and it helps a ton
You broke my heart momentarily when you said this video was made cause you guys broke up. 😡 lol
You broke my heart when y'all said you broke up! I was terrified that's where the video was headed
Go for enlightment ..
You won't regret..
Can’t have an ex if you never had a girlfriend... 😔😔
Thank you.
Omg my heart dropped for that half a second after you said you'd broken up.
ASAP Science, don't know your real names, and I'm surprised that I wasn't subscribed. I also loved all your videos and the cool animations you guys do. Unfortunately this video was not even a 5/10. You did not cover exes who cheat on you weeks after having your child and then leaving you. How do you stop loving a person who cheats on you, tries to get you thrown in jail and doesn't let you see your child? 


Getting over an ex is markedly harder when there is a child involved. Almost impossible I'd say. It's been 8 months.
Can you make a video on how Allergies work?
Asking for a friend, can I use this to get over a crush? (That friend is me btw)
cant get sad about a breakup if you never get in a relationship
Tylenol eh...
How about on its left side?
Like if you get it
Step 1 :  Find one
Step 2 : Well...I have no idea
How To Avoid A Potential Ex (and drama)? Stay single.
Much needed video around this time of the year :)
Nice that you posted this on Valentine's Day. Anyways, if you're following the Athlean x program - nutrition and fitness tips - getting over an ex will be a joke. Being able to improve yourself by mental fortitude and thinking, more energy, more restful nights, and overall fitness, you got the formula for true success in life.
Does this apply to having been rejected by someone you're strongly in love with? It's been three months since I last saw them or said anything to them but I'm still hurting; and since I didn't know them intimately I can't think of any flaws. And how do you stop the dreams aaarghh!
My solution to this, is to never get a girlfriend. Problem solved :D





I hate my life :'(
uploads on Valentine’s Day
Why am I watching this when I hasn't any relationships in my life
This is really the way to go!
Getting over one's crush might be more helpful for them singles on the internet
Great video.  I will consider some of these strategies for sure.  Thank you both for doing what you do here on YouTube.
I actually needed to hear this I’m going through a lot thanks guys
I needed this video 4 months ago 😭
Thanks a lot I needed it today
Date someone else almost immediately. This is the best cure. It distracts you, keeps you in the loop, and someone else still wants you.
O my god when you said because we broke up I stopped believing in true love for a sec
Aye perfect timing
This is why i dont have a girlfriend

I think
U can't get over an ex if u can never talk to girls amirite?
You actually fooled me thinking you had broken up!   Don’t do this ! Haha  awesome video !
My heart has been broken so many times that after a long time I decided to give myself a chance of a real relationship, and even though my girl is awesome, I can’t seem to love her.  

Maybe a video on “how to mend a broken heart?
I was so scared when you said you broke up for a sec
I’m single, but this works with getting over a friendship.
But I see mine everyday in class...
Who is Single too?
my heart skipped a beat when you said, you broke-up not a frenetic fan but still. close cal!
You uploaded this video 3 months too late....feelsbad
JESUS CHRIST MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT AT THE END OF THE VIDEO
I still don't bevelize greg and mitch broke up 😥
Why did nobody notice that there was a jar of weed on the shelf at 1:35
Can u do a video on the zombie deer?
was alone in this valentine , ^_^'
Dude i'm not sad, i just still so mad about everything he did to me!
What are the odds...... I was thinking about this earlier. Someone help me😭
This is bringing up some sad memories 😭
Lol I never laughed so hard when "flat earther" appeared
Lol this is Trisha paytas and Jason Nash they should see this
Why did they break up 
I can’t believe this
Good Valentine's Day video, I like it!!
Someone give me a bottle of Tylenol! XD
love the new thumbnail style
o-o
this is useful
It’s hard to not see your ex when you have 3 classes with them and have to look at them for 2/3 if those classes
0:05




I'm jungSHOOK.
Wow. So smart. Hey I have a great idea, let's talk about breakups on Valentine's Day. You such asap science
Listening to BTS will cure you
Theres no science behind it. It just takes time but you have to avoid them.
This literally made my day!!❤️
This actually works 🙂
I had a mini heart attack with that last joke
When you're ex was your childhood crush 😢
my heart dropped when they said they broke up :c
Went from a 4 year relationship then a short time on my own on to a 6 year relationship.  10 years , I'm having a break now . Lol
3:24 Dear god you nearly killed me with that joke
All I gotta say is thank you!
I just took 9000mg of Tylenol. Should I feel better soon?
Sending this video to break with my girlfriend
You guys are awesome! Keep up the great videos!
When you run out of science ideas, so you post bullcrap like these
Inundate yourself with strange. That’s how.
Step 1:
Murder your ex
Who heart broke for a quick sec when he said that they broke up?😂
I don’t have to ever have an ex! 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰






Because I am single 😖
I'm actually going to use negative reappraisal to get over sugar and sweets!
He was a flat earther xD
avoid can't getting over an ex by simply not having an ex in the first place
You uploaded this the same week i broke up with my ex lol wtf
Wtf has happened to this channel..
You used to make videos that were actually useful and interesting
The music sounds like it's from how to train your dragon. It makes me feel like crying😭
Perfect timing lads
when you said we broke up my heart sunk... holy shit. Don’t do that to meeeee
May the soldiers who died today in Jaish attack in Kashmir live in peace!!
You make it sound like ex-partners are the worst people ever, whom you have to hate, forget and ban from your life immediately... I broke up with my then-boyfriend about half a year ago because somehow my feelings changed and I didn't love him anymore - but I still like him, because he's a great guy and there are no bad feelings between us. I really don't want a romantic relationship with him again, but we're basically best friends and I would hate to hate him...
I legit got offended in the first 3 seconds of the video
Or just be alone forever.
Omg I love you guys so much
4 to 5 away.....try it 😎🇻🇮
I need one about how to get over a crush
U guys are dating?? I thought u guys were just best friends lol. Happy Valentine’s Day tho
Was that a simone giertz  at the very last second?😄
What if my ex was the one that got away, just the wrong situation and if the time and place were different you would’ve married them? We both love each other so much I just hope we meet again after university.
Greg really knows the algorithm
Can you make a video for how to remove body hair
Block them, forget them
I know it's always said "time heals everything", but my ex broke up with me almost three years ago and I still can't stop thinking about him. What if the person you try to get over is the one?
It 
Is 
Valentine's Day
Wait....they were together? Damn I'm so clueless.
Never thought i'd see you guys say HATE could be good for someone. Then again I might be overreaching on my definition of "negative reappraisal". IMO be frank with your feelings, keep what you loved, see what's better and don't put everything in a hate box.
Learning to let go of the love of my life
It's hard when you had such a deep connection with someone but some times it dies & you need to accept the fact they weren't the one for you 
He's a great person though & hope he finds himself and true love though
Just needs to grow & mature
I had to block my good friend because he was way too stalky and always texted me... Sooo... Even though I'm happy I made it and completely cut our contact but... I always think about how sad and selfhating he must feel right now... How can I forget him and his feelings?
I was talking to a man on fb we had a lot of chat and exchanged pics and xpics and now he just really doesn't want to talk to me and i love him😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
God damn its exam day ma dudes
3:20 AH THE EX BOYFRIEND HAD A NEW BF AWWWWWW.
what if I want here back thow and we might accurly have a future ?
The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.
Bold of you to assume I have an ex
"flath earther" "anti-vaxxer" lol
I just started crushing on a girl that I've been talking to for awhile but I'm 99% sure she doesnt like me like that. It hurts so much I cant get her out of my head. Sometimes it does feel like physical pain :(
3:00 wow she/he is a flat earthed and an anti-vaxer it’s the whole package
The cringe în the comments, oh God. The cringe hurts more.
Bad stuff about my ex “flat Earther” 
Am I the only who saw that??
My mum always said: "The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else".
this video came out just in time. Literally broke up with my ex the day before Valentine’s day😂
How do I get over a crush that has a date/boyfriend/fiancé/husband?
First
this is the hardest thing I've done. 2 years later I was still not over him. I tried the negative appraisal but he didn't have bad qualities lol
When you said you made this because you broke up I swear I was ready to unsubscribe lol
Thanks for saying almost
I thought this was going to be helpful but then I realized it doesn’t apply to me because I’m a freshman and I have 5 classes a day with my ex. Yeet.
Thanks for this, it ended a few days ago. I’ve been going crazy everyday since, guess I have to make a list..
>doesn't have an ex
>still watches
don't give me a heart attack like that ever again!
I never been in a relationship WTF am I doing here?!?!? 😂
Murder them. DUH!!!
*frantically grabs tylenol*
I could’ve used this months ago and hopefully I’ll never need it again
Jaja damn, really believed you did break up
you can't get over your ex if you don't have ex *cries in corner*
3:24 YOU CAN'T DO THIS THAT'S SO NOT COOL DUDE
This is SO helpful!
Wait... greg and mitch are dating???
I have a question: are u two guys  together?
yeah yall better  not break up flips weave
Oh Jesus I wouldn't want to date a flat earther. Every day will have no sexy nights!
I clicked on this video so quick
i had an actual heart attack at the end when you said y'all broke up im glad it was a joke
actually the best tylenol ad
I am in one of on off relationship -_-
Blow and hookers work well I hear
🎵 All my exes live in Texas 🎶
who tf uses facebook
This vid made me go stalk my ex
Thank you, Next!
Damn you guys know us so well
Never had an ex🤣
this is true!  I always talk shit about my ex made a whole list of his bad traits and remind myself how aint shit he is and it helped me stop seeing him as an angel and get past it
This video could have been a life saver for me half a year ago. Luckily, Jacksepticeye had been ok as well
First I would like to have an ex
Ha. Jokes on you, I never had someone to break up with to begin with!
3:23 My heart stopped there for a second...
I think its good, that u bring a vid like this on the 14th of February.
I also think its terrible to make ppl think bad about their exes.
For ppl with really terrible exgirlfriend/exboyfreind(/exinterfriends? is that a word) it might help much.
i really needed this today.
Hey @AsapSCIENCE what supplements for weight loss are safe and effective/ hunger suppressors, there's a lot of misinformation from what i read as some are habit forming
this is how many more years you’ll be single for 👇
Too funny that you uploaded this today
jokes on you. I don’t have one.
I wish uploaded this video a month ago goddam
This will be their most viewed video
Just do what I do. Stay single for your entire life.
Say, “f em”
even if I do all these things, still can't get over HER.
Perfect timing fam
Get over your ex...



On Feb. 14th 



*Clap
Great video guys. You're doing a great job but after relationships you normally dont get deprissions. I think what you ment were depressive moods which are totally fixable with the strategies explained in the video. But real depressions are extremely difficult to overcome and it often requires some kind of therapy to cure them.
Pause the video at 1:34 that right there are flowers smoke them not the tylenol weed will help with that change my mind 😂😂🖕🏼
I haven’t watched the video yet so idk if this was mentioned but honestly try to think about it logically. I know that it’s hard bc you’re full of overwhelming sadness, angriness, loneliness, etc. Think to yourself; did they ever physically, emotionally, or mentally abuse you? Did they ever make a promise or multiple promises that they failed to keep? Do their morals align with your own? Are they motivated to move further in life and improve their state of being? Was communication an issue? Did you bond with them on both a friendly and romantic/sexual level (assuming that you aren’t aro/ace)? All of these are valid questions to ask yourself and I notice that for me, they help clear up my tunnel vision and realize that the relationship isn’t as good as I thought it was. Hopefully this helps some people and just remember that things will get better and you will move on, but only if you make the effort to do so.
I’ve done all these things and I’m not there yet 😂 I was doing really damn good for a while then I had dreams consistently about them and now I feel like I’m longing again smh
The negative qualities though! hahahah
Easier said than done.
Now that I now how now all I need is an ex
Thank you guys I've been depressed for weeks so this helps
Revenge also is petty good way to get over an ex after they cheat on you.

Especially when the result ends with them selling their house cuz their dad was tax evading via offshore accounts with money from online gambling, and all it took was reporting them to the IRS.
Great valentine video btw.
The first time I saw you video I got to the part were you said "we broke up", I was shocked and paused the video. I didn't get to the part were you said "we are joking", so all this time I have  believen that you actually split up!
First you actually need to have a girlfriend
What about the old correlation/causation issue?...
OMG NEVER JOKE ABOUT BREAKING UP I WAS ABOUT TO CRY >_<,,,
Does the Tylenol thing work for dealing with grief from the loss of a parent? My mother died recently and I'm struggling... Also this video was helpful to me anyway because while I wasn't in a formal relationship with someone I did recently have a friendship (I was in love with them though) severed so it seemed close enough. ...please pretend this was worded eloquently... It made sense in my head.
How does youtube recommend knows that I need this?
so relatable ... honestly thanks
i really needed this
Telling people to take tylenol to get over an ex is not good advice, that is toxic to your liver in prolonged usage even at low doses; best way is to realize it is going to take time and a lot of it, just try to focus on yourself, take time to find a new job, workout and work on bettering yourself in constructive and not destructive ways, social media stalking, drinking, and destructive behaviors are avoidance tactics that will destroy you in the end. do something good, help someone out, do good things and realize it will take almost as much time as you were in the relationship to get over the relationship; but it does get easier and easier
1:33 - if I had to take paracetamol every time when I feel socially rejected, I would pretty quickly die from overdose. Or at least seriously damage my liver.
You guys scared me at the end omg
Bold of you to assume I have had a girlfriend
Omg thank you
Okay so I was listening to this in the background while cooking and your out card made me internally yell ....WTF .....OH GOD DANG IT....okay you got me
I could've used these tips years ago, but I'm glad to see this later as opposed to never.
Everyone is saying that they don't have an ex because they're lonely
How to get get over someone you never had a relationship with
go into no contact and work on yourself
Thank you ♡
This sounds so bizzare
You can say that again, I got arrhythmia after breaking up
Thank you AsapSCIENCE, very cool !
Guys get crazy over break ups because they imagine the next guy hitting it
Tried it. Didnt work
A funny topic I wanted to see
3:05 - They're a rude, flat earthing, anti-vaxxer? Who on earth was with that person D:
Hey Greg & Mitch,


I love the video, I would love to see you guys make a video on the science behind domestic violence.  What it does to the victim's brains (trauma bonds, stockholm syndrome) as well as the chemical changes it causes (how these toxic relationships literally become an addiction) . Since there is such a stigma on being a victim of such violence, the rest of the world can't seem to (nor does it seem like they want to) educate themselves on why it's so hard for victims to leave these toxic relationships.


Being a survivor of such violence myself and finally being able to break that cycle and leave the relationship. I've become determined to educate as many people as I can on exactly why it's so hard to leave. Why it's so hard to get over our abusive exes and why we tend to go back an average of 7 times before fully being able to break things off. I've done bouts of research on this, for myself and for others I will be able to help in the future. Not only are there emotional, financial and physical dependencies, abusers tend to put on this mask so that people do not believe the victim because there's no way someone so nice can be so abusive. This minimizes the severity of the abuse at hand, this causes the victim to feel like they are over reacting. (Gaslighting the victim)


On the other hand, police aren't too well trained to deal with domestic violence. The first time I tried to leave my abuser, i called the police for help and they ended up arresting me and holding me in a containment cell for hours. (Reinforcing that trauma bond to my abuser) I had to go to court and ultimately at the end,to be proven innocent. But the damage had already been done. If this happened to me, in Canada a country not known for police brutality, think about other vulnerable men and women in America for example who are victims and finally got the courage to leave? Being wrongfully arrested happens more than we would hope. 


I really do hope you guys decide to touch base on this growing issue. I wish no one would have to go through what i went through and i will not take this information with me to the grave. I will inform, support and educate as many people as I can. 



Take Care.


-Nicole
Finally,I'm so happy!!!!
I was able to get over my ex by getting under my new BAE
I like how you said “Carve your pain into a leather seat” instead of cut yourself
explain how song obsession works
I've never had true feelings for someone until last year I met the most beautiful woman in my eyes. We had a lot of common interests and had so much chemistry together. I met her parents at thanksgiving dinner, and that's when the weekend of romance started. Later that night we went got a hotel, drank wine, ate pizza, and had a bath bomb together. It was a lovely intimate night! Four weeks later she got engaged to a different man. Talk about a plot twist! My heart is still recovering
Quite best topic for valentines... not cool guys. Don’t get me wrong, you’re doing great job but this just isn’t the time when you should speak about these things. Peace
Would any of this work for losing someone who moved away?
Perfect timing, how did you guys know my gf broke up with me just yesterday?
I’ve never had an ex! Or a girlfriend😢
If they ever break up the end of the world has officially started
No virtue signaling once again
Is it weird if I don't know what "love" feels like?
can't get over your ex if you've never had one
Does this help with my dad leaving ?
i almost had a heart attack when they said they broke up
Broke up with my girlfriend today. This video couldn't have come at a better time.
Be like Ross.
How do i get over with my right hand?
Been alone for 10 years. I retreat to my perfect illusions to get me through the day to day until I fall asleep.
“Flat earther” “ant-vaxxer” yup… that’ll get me over an ex real quick
Flat Earther** 🤯😬😬
I've been using negative reappraisal for years without even realizing it lol. Only problem is, it's not working with the current person I'm trying to get out of my head.
What a timing asap science!!
Hahaha that 1 second got me 3:23,
I guess I kind of thought you guys were married. Of course, it's always been obvious you're a couple.
do 100 digits of tau
3:07! Much respect
Let me get a ex first
Time is the best healer
que ~i cant get over you~
Wish you made this video earlier
Just say thank u next
Y'all better not break up, you two are the reason I still believe in love
0:02 call an exorcist
Omg if you would've named it "we broke up" I would've died. Lol
When ASAPscience helps me more than my therapist
Can’t break up if you never have a girlfriend in the first place
Awesome and informative video
What are you supposed to do if they are your best friend?
Well sucks when your ex never really opened up and therefore you don't know much about their negative sides.
It may be halthy for the person taking the strategy to exercise negative reappraisal, but is it really worth it to end up exagerating or even lying to yourself, even at the cost of ending up believing it? Is it worth it if you start to spread or publicly defend those ideas, becoming someone toxic or even bringing consequences to your perhaps innocent ex-partner?
That'sa morally delicate suggestion to make @asapscience.
Hellooooo TYLENOL my best friend
Definitely needed this today
Do a vid on salvia like if he should
I’m so happy u guys didn’t break up, those where the most terrible seconds of my life 😂😭
Oh... AND HAPPY VALENTINES DAY
Euphoria~💜
Cant have an ex if you dont have a girlfriend 😎 haha im lonely
Stop calling me out
3:23 My heard died for a second there D:
Just climb
Now how do you get over a long term friendship breaking up
damn, i am going through a breakup right now. good timing...i guess?
(3:06) is the best
Seeing this video and thinking: no matter what strategy i adapt, i will never get over it...
Well then...Where was this video 6 months ago??? 😂😂😂
Why am I watching this? I've never been in a relationship.
It's been 2 years.... I still can't do it
thanks guys needed this
Some of these strategies try to be quick fixes for a process that’s completely normal. I say embrace the sadness and don’t harbor resentment. You want to come to an understanding based on reason not emotion. Although those negative side effects do exist, at least when you recover you’re more you.

Basically in their method you reject every part of that other person. In this method you accept them as part of your past.
You scared me you guys my fav couple
How to get over your ex? Easy don't get a gg in the first place, it works all the time.
This was really good advice
I need to send this to my ex
So basically, acetaminophen will get you over it.
then your ex comes with a gun to shoot you
U guys scared me st the ending with that.
literally got dumped a week before valentines day, the day before the one year anniversary of the suicide of my childhood best friend. she refuses to speak to me and hasnt and possibly never will return my shit. but its totally fine. im totally fine.
Is this a Tylenol commercial?  You could have simply said Acetaminophen.
wait, they’re dating?
I can't help seeing everything she posts i can't help it i miss her.
Just found out my ex and my best friend got together 3 days after we split, this ain’t it chief
im still waiting for the asmr test video
What if it isn’t an ex and just someone you fancy? 







I am in the friend zone :/
Lol I have no ex to begin with
„So we made this vodeo because we broke up“ - DON‘T YOU EVER DO THIS TO US AGAIN PEOPLE!!!!
Yeah thanks I need this
Break up with whomever you're dating cause I'm bored
I’m too lonely to have even a gr
Sad that this was posted on Valentine’s Day...
Where is They watch T Series as a bad thought about them?
0:01 in and i'm already crying
Nice timing 👍
this is incredibly disturbing bc i had a dream about my ex yesterday which caused me to miss him dearly and feel really sad for the whole day today and NOW i see this pop up in my feed LMAO
It's like you guys watched over me wow


even tho its gon be tough cause he wasn't a bad person, he was caring and nice to me and i still loved him even when i was the one breaking up :') help me lol im dying this is the first time this is happening to me
Can't relate but still watching in case i got one in future
1:56 that sly reference lol
I needed this so badly. Lol
Thank u, next
This video is made on the day i broke up with my bf
I'm watching this with my boyfriend so I can't relate or get help from this
Thanks I need this
I never had a relationship, I just want to see what’s the big deal. Lmao
How do I get an ex?
How to have ex when you are forever alone
Why didn't I think of this before? Should have saved a lot of heartaches.
My ex is in my class and we have a lot of mutual friends. It's really painful to have to see her all the time, even though I've moved on at this point 
I feel like I'd be happier if I could cut her off, but I have no choice but to try to stay friends with her due to circumstances 
Sucks that I can't take this video's advice :/
Don't. Live the pain. Feel your feelings like a real human being instead of pining for the false happy place we call society.
Dear ASAPScience, please stop making these  “love” videos and do more stuff on biology and chemistry on genetics, would be nice to see more of that, I’ve watched all you got when it comes to them and I need new ones !!
The physical pain is very true. My chest literally ached for a few weeks after my breakup. Luckily coping better now.
this came out at the right time
I’d probably needed this a couple years ago but this year i have someone special.
brb about to take some Tylenol
Thank u, next
Thank you, really. Thank you
Burning Question: Are Aliens Real? or Do Extraterrestrial Life Exist? What proves it?
Imagine them pooping, it’s that simple...unless you’re into that kind of thing.
Can u get addicted to Tylenol? Lol
Anti Vaxxer lmao XD
It's been almost 2 years since it happened to me... 2 months since I felt any emotional pain... this video in my recommendations destroyed all that ...thanks asap science I'll go swallow some Tylenol now
The best way to get over an Ex is not to have one in the first place
what about still being friends with them since you both share the same friend group? how bad is that? asking for a friend lol xx
That was my first question when I seen this video I was thinking oh crap did they break up I'm happy you didn't you guys make the best videos I've been watching them since I've been in high school and I'm still watching
Thanks guys.
Just broke up from my 3 year long relationship . And, YouTube just knows what to recommend 😔
I never knew they were dating lol
Thank U, Next
I’m naughty. But it’s okay. Because I’m...




Pretty? No... I’m 






Just okay.

Happy Valentine’s Day then ❤️❤️❤️
You had to post it on Valentines day.. targeting the larger group (single) much?
just browse r9k and you will never have an ex 👌
Or just have your ex cheat on you like the degenerate they are, helps immensely too.
Don't know why I'm here, I've never had an Ex, because I've never had a girlfriend😂😭.
Just wanted to let you guys know if you show people your house and where you're setting them up in a video you've already compromised your security. Plus people now know the type of system you're using and can now study ways of hacking it.
Break up for real
Would love to know how to get over an abusive relationship and overcome all the insecurities that shit gave me while also overcoming the fact that my ex has taken all my friends away.
The problem is I don't want to get over and move on to the next one, I still love her and can't stop thinking about us being together again in the future. Wouldn't this bad quality write over thing ruin any future possibilities?
Lifehack: break up with them before they can break up with you
Like iy fou never had an ex...
goddamn it karen
This was in my recommended  and i am not disappointed..
I didnt even know they were together.
I almost had a heart attack when you said you broke up! Please, don't scare me like that
That tylenol xD just get some thc
He died, that made things.... well pretty final.
wait, didn’t know facebook/instagram stalking is a thing, i thought you usually cry and then try to find somebody else to replace them quick and then bounce back emotionally to realize you jump too soon
I’m here for comments only 😂😂like if u too
Never had an ex but have a girlfriend
How do you get over someone you never dated?
Could of used this a few weeks or months ago
Make a video about if you could suffocate and die from holding your breath
The "thinking about the negative stuff" method, while it my be beneficial in the long run for you to get over your ex, I think it teaches you to hate, it doesn't allow you to comprehend and respect other people's reasons (your ex's), it could make us even more selfish for future relationships.
takes the whole Tylenol tablets
Thanks.... u rock!
So bad qualities and Tylenol. Got it!
oops i need this
I’ve never had a girlfriend but... okay
DONT SCARE ME LIKE THAT!!! don’t break up plz ;(
Crap! stop social relationship based stuffs1
Can’t be sad about an ex if you never get a girlfriend in the first place
Burn Book.... lol! 😂
ok now i can overdose on tylenol
Can you make a video of how to find out how tall you’re going to be when you stop growing
3:04 ~ anti vaxxer
Cant have a breakup if u dont have a boyfriend! Hahahaahh.... sob..




Edit:oof i copied comments without knowing im sorry
i swear i thought you guys broke up
0:00 notice the word almost
Yes, I like shredded wheat
Lmao this is not for me
Hold up are these two guys together?!?!?!!?!!?
1:34 I’m sure the weed will help 10x more than Tylenol
It’s hard having an ex when u both love each other and didn’t breakup because of one cheated or u just fell outta love but where forced to
3:04 Anti Vaxxer
To over somebody is to get under somebody else
Ok but what if we're still friends and we both still want to be friends but I don't want to be depressed over this for the rest of ever
Biacth I have never had a relationship
How do you get over an ex who killed themselves while we were together? Because I have a lot of guilt for not being able to stop her
0:00 - "Almost" everyone.......keyword almost
You guys totally scared me when you said you broke up! Happy to hear it was a joke.
Although I’ve never been in a relationship, it’s good to know the 7 stages of grief and know that it takes time to get over someone
I break up with my ex about a month ago, I'm feeling waaay better now.
I only want to say thank you. 4 months ago my ex broke up with me a happy relationship of about 8 yrs. This video will help me a lot
Easy, dehumanize them
Thank you.
I don't have an ex to get over, but I may come back to this vid in the future if I need to. I hope you too [Greg and Mitch] don't ever break up you are made for each other!
Easy,  just use a car
You guys are awesome
‘Flat earther’ lmao
That ending though. You guys are evil.
On again, off again relationships are obviously unhealthy. People think it is fine but I have always thought it was disturbing and will never work.
Wait what happened to the video about incest? Did it get removed?
In a nutshell, take Tylenol.
Hey can you guys do a song about phi?
Thank you.
How to get a date anyone?😂
I'm over my ex. Just came for some knowledge to help friends in the future. Anyone else? Lol
Can’t have an ex if you never had a girlfriend
where was this a few months ago
You guys scared me
3:23 :00000
I think that if you're actually over them you can talk and hang out with them without suffering or wanting them back... I do it
You can't escape, these feelings of hate
I do that! 0:22
do you guys have a video about how to get one?
Asap :(((( this hurts
you gave me a tiny heart attack. Do not ever break up... I forbid it
I ended a 7 year relationship with my first boyfriend in October. We have a 4 year old together, so we'll always be family but he's not coping well right now, but I'm thriving. This video kind of broke my heart. I hope things get easier for him
1:38 there is some bud in that jar
Wait... You guys are a couple??
I'd like to know what will happen to the channel if you guys ever break up
Ima take 60 Tylenol to get over it thanks

I almost shat my pants at the end oooffff
Haha.! Try throwing a child into the picture.
yo why was this uploaded the very day i found out she cheated on me
"When you throw the thrash out, do you go outside later and check up on it? No? Stop stalking your ex!"
I wish my ex the best. However, I never want to see her in my life again
They were dating?? KSSJTAHAGSGSHBSHDVS
I feel personally attacked
Wonder whats in that jar @1:34 ? hmmm....
Omg tylenol??? Wow
Damn good.
Wait, why did I even watch this if I don't even have an ex nor a boyfriend???
My now ex broke up with me last saturday after 2 years of being together :/
Don’t do me like that, damn near gave me a heart attack when you said y’all broke up 😭
when they said they broke up though.....
This hit me right in the feels :/
Can’t break a heart if you never had a heart, right?
I hope my exs know that so they get over me
You are two years to late
That "almost" at the start tho...
This aromantic is never gonna have an ex to get over.

Reasons why i don’t date
How do you can get over if somebody rejects you
hey, guys so my girl of almost 2 years broke up with me today. ik I'm supposed to move on and do all the tips said in the video, but its just dam had when we've planned a life together. idk what to honestly. And the social stalking for me is hard to break, cuz she would post on her twitter passive aggressive stuff, or I would hear from my friends what she posted on snap. I need some help hoimes.
I was really hoping I wasn’t gonna need this video when I saw it recommended like two weeks ago. Come to find out today that I now have another ex girlfriend. I’ll trust the scientists.
I refuse to get over it, I will get her back, and later on, I will be happy that I dont give up something so that I'd regret.
Reconnect with “friends”? Is that a fortnite upgrade?
I was on and off with my boyfriend, 3 times in 10 years, but it just feels so right when we find eachother again. Anyway, I made a mistake when I found myself single, and that was moving on too fast. I just went out for 2 dates, nothing much, just talking. But enough to make sure I was being wanted. Don't do that. Even though we are told that the best way to move on is to start dating other people, you're just becoming shallow. Focus on what you didn't like about you ex is wrong. Focus instead on how he/she made you feel!! Maybe you were unhappy, maybe you were giving more than you were receiving, maybe you didn't feel appreciated enough and so on. This will help you realise the break-up was for the best. Don't rush dating. Stay with yourself for a while, learn what you like, who you are, what mistakes you made (we all make mistakes and we also have to try to be our best versions) so you can find someone someday who can treat you and love you the way you deserve and viceversa :)
Mind ya business
how can i get over my dead ex?
How about your best friend that you  asked out but said no but still have to be around her for P.E.? She's in my class and everything turned so weird and she stopped talking to me dramatically then she did before. D:
Jeez.... please no one take Tylenol to deal with social situations. That is such horrible promotion. Don't band-aid natural feelings, learn to work through them.
My ex dumped me last week this came just in time 😭😅
Thanks guys
Omg this is what I needed.. JK I need a big fat chocolate box, a hot cup of tea  and a nice movie to have myself a merry Valentine day😜
Honestly I just want the healthy relationship that the ASAP guys have, hopefully one day I’ll find the one
I don’t need any tips
If I never had a relationship then I can’t have a ex hehe
help me
Best way to get over somebody is to get under somebody else.
Another tip: give yourself time. Forcing myself to get over my ex made me feel better on the surface short term. I didn't actually deal with how I really felt and my issues with him and our relationship until later on which made it worse long term. Don't push yourself to be over someone in 1 month or 2 or 3 or whatever but stay in touch with what you need to process before you try to move on.
So take a bunch of Tylenol..got it
Hey Syd if you end up watching this video and seeing this comment I’m sorry I hope you are doing amazing
Oh it’s easy. Stay single
my ex broke up with me last year ( on valentinesday )... yay... but its ok i simply made what you've told in the video... but it took ... 3 months
Just smoke a blunt.
While watching this im eating a banana.
Lmao thank god my ex and I aren’t sad over each other at all
this came in months late but im still in great pain help
After 1 year and 9 months he leave me :( now im  working out with my best friends :)
Can't get rid of a ex if you ever had one
I hope that this video helps someone. Me, I think that I finally have gotten over my ex after the toughest months of my life. But, even if I'm not ready to a new partner yet, I'm happy that my life is not a living hell anymore... Strength, for all of you that need it! It all gets better, pinky promise ♡.
Shoot. I think I need to take this advice.  .-.
Just get someone else

2 years later, I still can't think of anything significant shortcomings with her, which only makes things worse.
why am i watching this i literally have never had a boyfriend
Love this
So basically drug yourself and it's all good
My gf broke up wit me Tuesday and I wanna get her back
1:35 Bro just smoke the weed
oh... so it doesnt teach me how to get over hh's death
I Don't Even Have Girlfriend
This was actually quite helpful. I think I'll actually try this metbod out I've never heard of it. It's been one year since I've been dumoed by my last ex and it's still hard to this day to 100% get around thinking about her. But this seems like a good way.
but lets say she didnt leave you and she maybe died in a car wreck after 5 years of marriage and you feel responsible for everything
Whst do you do if you broke up with someone and there in your class??
take drugs o k a y
Cynical valentines
What about, how to get an EX?
I have never really need neither of those strategies, when I broke up with my ex(s), it was mostly in a peaceful way, always talking about it, and no negative feelings came with it, maybe some melancholic days, but most of the time i kept being friends with them (even 2 of them are best friends now lol). I don't think you really need to erase that people from your life, it can be done safely.
Anyone else forever alone?
I’m friends with my ex now.
Got friendzoned after one year of seeing someone and thinking we were a couple. Adding this to my already deep depression was hard. It still hurts a lot after 3 months, like physically hurts...
Easy answer. Get with someone else. Works Everytime with me.
So just become drugs addict
And please NEVER EVER beg them to return. You should always respect yourself and maintain your dignity. You should realise that you’re so much more worthy. Never beg them to be with you, it should be their choice, they should be willing.
Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wait wait wait wait.... So if I'm sad... Take a Tylenol? Isn't.... That gonna lead to addiction?..... And more sadness?
“Anti-vaxxer “ 😂😂😂😩💀
I feel attacked
Just go get the next chic that wants you man, or woman! You're worth it!
Flat earther, lol
So cute and still love the white board animation ahhh you guys are great :) 
(Thankfully I don’t need to ever break up or get over an ex again ;) )
You two stopped my heart with that joke! Can't just toss around "we broke up. Jk!" without giving people heart attacks, you loons. Lmao
My boyfriend broke up with me a day before my birthday. He told me he “never loved me”
Does not read is a positive
I have a crush on an anime character, so I don't have to go through this soon sense no one would want to go through a relationship with me.
I don’t like the push for Tylenol. Try meditation, it does all the same stuff
You don’t have to deal with breakups if you never have a girlfriend...(this is me trying to feel good about myself)
Right on cue

A dose of mdma and the song memories by david guetta
I know another way to get over my ex. Get them on to lie on the bed and then I lie my front touching there front and then move my backside up and down 😂😂🤣🤣
Just saying guys there are plenty of impressionable people that could assume taking a large amount of tylenol is the cure for breakups... you might want to clarify that's not the route to go.
This isn't what I want . I want a video on how to stop your ex from getting over you xD
my now ex-boyfriend broke up with me yesterday (on valentine's day) whoop :'(
What does doing chewing Tabacco or dip do to your health?
I’ve never had an ex.
I have borderline personality disorder and the 2 break ups I've experienced were so intense and my reactions were so unnecessary and toxic. I appreciate this video.
If you’d clickbaited me with “we broke up” I would’ve cried so hard don’t do that
Thanks #AsapSCIENCE
Out of sight out of mind
I’ll use the negative reappraisal strategy for my bad habits
Hope you find a new person thats the best way to get over an ex
Omg! Y'all scared the ever living crap out of me when I heard the words "we broke up" my heart sunk in my damn stomach. Me and my kids looooooooove you guys!! Thank you for the joke but damn....😂😂😂😭
If y’all broke up, that’d immediately break YouTube.  Also, I’d argue these tips could probably help getting over a heavy crush. It’s different from a full-on relationship but if you’re close enough, I’d argue the pain can be the same if not slightly less.
LOVE that you put this up today of all days. I really need it. My ex broke up with me just before christmas and now his already moving in with a new girl... My life is hell and I'm trying so hard to get over him right now.
Interestingly enough, I used the negative reappraisal technique to cut junk food out of my diet years ago... never knew what it was called until now

Can’t get over your ex if you’ve never had a girlfriend HAHAHA ahh I’m so lonely
i fainted when they said they broke up
Was this vid sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry?
It's been almost a year and I still can't do it. We essentially "grew up" together... I know she's happy. I like that she's happy. I just can't deal with her absense. Can't take it. How long is too long for not getting over your ex? Why does it have to be so hurtful? I've fallen behind on every aspect of my life. I barely attend my classes at uni. I'm not as productive at work as I used to be. I. I hesitate to get out of bed in the morning. I don't want this anymore. I can't take it anymore. The pain is too much. It hurts so much without you being around, ex.... I truly miss you
1:34 I'll take the big jar for medicine
Does it work for an excrush?
So are they dating
If you love and miss them why should you leave them at the first place?
Can you make a video on "heaven's gate cult" I know it might be a creepy topic but I don't get it the people involved in it weren't dumb or illiterate or stupid

How to get over your ex....forget they exist and move on with your life
It’s a good idea to not even date someone that you wouldn’t want to like... marry.
Why am I here? I had no girlfriend since birth.
15 and never seen a girl
I'd rather just die at this point. Even when cut contact, the pain hasn't ended and keeps coming back up in the mind.. sucks when you come to realize you're the only one that was actually in love/actually cared and the other has had no problem being over with it... life sucks. Still rather die.
Uff, if you're going to mention a positive aspect of acetaminophen, PLEASE also warn people about how dangerous it is! So many people are killed by it, it's very dangerous to encourage people to take it without pointing out how easy it is to overdose and die. :(
Yall were dating.......frick.
It's not that I can't get over loving him. I DON'T love him. What I can't get over is how stupid I was to have thought he was right for me, and now I can't trust myself to ever fall in love with a truly good person. Anyone have any solutions...?
What ex? :,,(
Looking at people's flaws just makes you selfish. If you can't accept the cons of a single person, you'll likely not accept that of others.
How to get over your ex 101. Just get addicted to painkillers, at least that works for me

Just watching this vid is tough. Heartbreak is the worst.
Just had a break up 3 days before Valentine's
Hello Mitch and Greg! Thank you for uploading that video. I really needed it since my crush recently rejected me, and I really liked him a lot. He seemed like he liked me too until it all just suddenly ended. I wouldn’t have thought that distracting yourself from a breakup (or rejection in my case) would not really help with getting over your ex/ex-crush. I stopped paying attention to my emotional pain and thought it’d be better to ignore it and focus on schoolwork. But I don’t think I’m completely free from that pain. Now that you mentioned writing down negative things about the person every day, I am definitely going to do that stating tonight. This video meant so much to me, so a big thank you to both of you! With more videos like this one, you’re going to keep helping so many people around the world. I’m a huge fan of AsapSCIENCE and a huge fan of you two wonderful, intelligent people! Thank you for bringing your educational and extremely helpful videos into the world! You are amazing!
So pain killer kills all pain
it’s a good thing i’m still friends with my exes
Impossibru
I just impale them and feast upon their blood. But that’s just me.
Emotional pain is painful
Flat Earthers
Didn’t even realise they were dating...
Is this a science channel?
But what if you can’t think of anything bad about your ex?
just smoke some meth lol

How do I get over the feelings I have for my crush of 6 years? We were friends for a while and then kinda drafted apart but I can't move on. I think he knows that I like him but... I'm not sure and I'm too scared to tell him cuz if he rejects me I swear I won't be the same or maybe even kill myself. Any advice?
So basically..... drugs help with a breakup? Tell me something I don’t know....
or simply kill your ex?
Why dose this video have dislikes he’s stating facts huuuu people....
Can anyone give me some advice? I went thru my first breakup with my first boyfriend last year. We only dated for 4 months yet it still hurts 7 months after the breakup. I know he's moved on so why can't I? (he cheated and left me for someone else if that helps)
I wish I had a girlfriend or a friend.
):
Do you like shredded wheat?
I like how you guys put anti vaxxer and flat earthers in as negative quality’s of an ex lmao they are terrible qualities in people 😂 it’s so stupid for those types of people to not get there vaccinations and believe in something when there’s proof it’s not true and they’re just too ignorant to listen
Cant relate
You can't get over your ex if you never have a girlfriend Taps head
I appreciate the intent but the only way you can truly get over an ex is to realize that it was just 1 of many parts of your life. And it’s something that you can learn from and a challenge you need to overcome. Life is a series of challenges. The quicker you complete them the more successful you will be.
Geeeez, why didn't you guys create this video years ago? Ugh. Good thing it's Discount Chocolate Day tomorrow!
3:24 please don’t scare me like that again
I skipped a beat when they said they’d broken up
Cut her head off and use it as a football?
If your interested in a more in-depth look of the brain on why we are social creatures. Read "Social" by Mathew D. Liberman. Very insightful.
Its been 8 months since I've  last seen her. Sometimes I wonder if she still thinks about me. I dont even know what she looks like anymore... I hate this
Yes
Why are you reading this?
If you are dating a girl or trying to date a girl who is friends with their ex, just run !!!
I think I am Patrick living under his rock cause I didn’t know they were a couple and I have known about them since 2015
For some reason that announcement about you guys breaking up scared the shit out of me. I’m not one to normally care about people’s lives. Maybe because you make a nice couple? Idk haha. Plus I love science and didn’t want this channel to end
Excellent
Thanks
My teacher I'd dannielle muzzi
Really?  Couples that break up and get back together multiple times have commitment problems?  Shocking...
3:00 This "negative reappraisal" thing is pretty damn toxic, how about you just accept it didnt work out and move on instead of trying to hate the person and blow out of proportion every negative minutia about them? This is someone you used to love ffs. And if you need to manufacture a one-sided view of the person to move on, then you did not move on at all.
I’m a Virgin can’t relate xd
The only way to get over it is literally to find someone better than the ex which it should be easy... right?
Alexa play break up with your girlfriend, I’m bored
wow great timing .... that’s crazy
Can you make a podcast on the topic of breakups and like what your brain goes through when you go through them?? I think it would be really interesting and it’s something just about everyone can relate to somehow.
I'd be sad if you guys break up
Time heals everything and it is true. Think of love as just familiarity with a person over a long period of time. Block them, avoid them, delete all rubbish chats, photos. Throw away their gifts. If there’s nothing to remind you of them, you’ll forget them sooner.
where was this video 8 months ago??
I don’t get upset with breakups
It’s all fun and dandy till she calls and say she’s preganant.. while you’re on Tylenol
Wow 3mins and 37 seconds wasted when you could’ve just said block them and delete pictures of anything that’s she in
my ex left me recently for another girl i knew and was friends with back in 8th grade. we’re sophomores.
My bf and I just broke up and I’m hoping this helps :/
Can’t get over an ex if you don’t have one
Today? That’s ironic
Love doesn’t exist.
I want to die
Long time ago I unsubscribed this channel for some reasons. And looks like they are more crapier now.
This video isn't useful to me at all, why did I even watch it...
Needed this video 5 years ago. Stuck in an awful marriage with my ex who I chased few months after break up and persuaded to marry me...
r/madlads
Tylenol... the new coping mechanism.
What about the 'you have to get under someone to get over someone' thing? Is there any scientific basis in that?
Yeah my gf just broke up with me for no reason Tuesday.. I just don’t get it
My food cheated on me....My brother ate it...Q-Q
“Uses air quotes” 😂 im dead
I think it takes more than 3minutes of advice on this subject to get over someone
Hurt on a breakup? Become addicted to painkillers!
i cant deal with the pain of braking up with my ex its been a month since and today i saw her walking to her new bf house whilst i was on the bud going home from collage i just started crying and everyone looked at me. i have random brake downs every day or so and i dont want to have to deal with it anymore i just dont want to feel anything anymore. i still have a card and a jumper also a couple bracelets she gave me and i cant get myself to get rid of them i just dont know how she moved on so quickly and im the one stuck in pain i dont want to feel this way anymore ive also started having suicidal thoughts
kill her. easy
In the negative example why the men seem to be the one who is yelling and girl seem to be the victim????
Who is single and is watching this? Just me?
Can't cut off ties with an ex if you share a child. How would that work for us?
What if you're just numb to it? I still dislike the bastard, but it's not heartwrenching anymore.
Tyranol promotion?
Just hold a pic of your friends’s ex, and hit her in the head while she’s looking at it (phoebe and rachel)
Today in Japanese, we were going through a list of possible activities for tomorrow in Japanese, and my teacher called on me, and asked if I was going on a date. I laughed and said no. And then I tried not to make eye contact with my ex who I’m really not over. Oh god. Oofg
What if she isn’t my ex and I just like her? Please make a video on how to get over her. Thanks
What if she isn’t my ex and I just like her? Please make a video on how to get over her. Thanks
What ex?
Why am I watching this? I don’t have an ex and I won’t ever have one lmfaoo
what if u can’t think of anything bad ab ur ex? i’ve actually never had a bf.i’m just asking bc when i break up with somebody they’re not going to be able to think of anything bad ab me.
This is why I’m single and I don’t deal with strays
Can this work on a girl that isn’t even your ex
how do u get over your Crush when she cheated on you even when we havent talked or dated before
I don't need to get over my ex 


CAUSE IM SIGLE
I just took a fist full of Benadryl every time I thought about texting her
I'm so glad this video was uploaded today. Alot of people need to see it
Yes yall are on the right track but instead of acetaminophen I prescribe 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
I like this video being uploaded on valentine's Day... lol
No ex 
No problem 😎
My heart was mended until you said you guys broke up... then it shattered again
Never had one. Problem solved.
But what if she‘s a wonderful person and just doesn‘t give a shit about me anymore. There isn‘t anything bad about her so I can‘t just remember all the bad things she did to feel good🤷‍♂️
Is 1 bottle of tylenol enough !!
Rename the video!!! DO IT!!
i needed this tq
Here before 1 billion views hahah
0:03 nice got over it
Happy Valentine's day amigos
Lol! That timing... can't believe you guys made a video about this. That's exactly what I'm feeling right now even though it has been for like a year plus. I guess this is part of life =/
Joke on you ,I’ve never talked to a girl .......... .............(please kill me).

PLS ANSWER THIS!! Do you feel the same feelings when you get rejected by your crush ......... cos I did today
How to get over not having a relationship?
wtf, I literaly googled How to get over my ex yesthurday, and now a video shows up, iluminati confirmed
Bold of you to assume I have an ex
I just go to why!
I think that we all think it's a little bit immature to block people in the social media just because yes. But I think one of the best solutions to breakups is to block. You don't see his/her face anymore. Their Instagram stories don't appear in your first slot, you don't see publications where he/she is tagged. It can really make a difference.
Who's watching this while getting dumped?
Take acetaminophen? Seriously? That’s terrible advice.
If you're happy with yourself pain from a breakup is shorter than this video.
Waouh ! Nice video guys ❤️
For all those that are still having a hard time moving on. Just know that completely forgetting about an ex is sometimes not the answer. That person is a part of your history and your personal growth. You can still think about an ex and not wish to get back together, it’s completely fine. So don’t put yourself down if you’re having a hard time. Just remember that one of biggest lies that you tell yourself is that everyone has their shit together, but in reality people very rarely do.
Best way to get over your ex? Tie her up, gag her, put her in the trunk of her car, and then roll said car into a lake.
I never date a girl before. So is this video might be helpful?
Who else has spent the V-day alone?? 😂...This is so useful thanks @asapscience
If getting over an ex would be as easy as just following steps or instructions, it wouldn't be that hard. Even though I agree with all the points mentioned in the video (and followed them myself), a lot of the time it doesn't matter what you do. The most important thing is to give it time.
I personally believe that the only healer is time. Don't stalk ot communicate with the ex AT ALL, and let time do the rest.
How can I get a gf/bf in the first place?
Pff, who needs a partner anyways!
NEVER BREAK UP PLZ
I find a murder spree of happy couples  to be extremely therapeutic to the feeling of loss... Ah, what a nice day to have an axe.
Bold of you to assume I've ever even had a boyfriend😛😂😅😥
Whos watching this on valetines day
I needed this video 5 years ago.
this seem like junk science.  where's the citations?
why am i watching this I've never been in a relationship
Step 1_ put your hands around his neck
I really really needed this! Thank you guys so much! I am still stuck on my ex when we broke up almost a year ago because we are still friends and see each other every day almost. We have had a few times in the last 3 or 4 months where we had a good time and then she just reminded me the next day that she just doesnt care about me by going with someone else to do something we were supposed to do. Like I saod thank you guys and I will probably watch this more than once in the coming days.
NEED HELP PLEASE WHAT IF WE GOT KIDS WITH HER AND WE HAVE TO SEE CALL AND BE AROUND

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ;)
*Asapscience board meeting*

Boss: What should we do for Valentine's?

Guy1: Something about love maybe?

Girl: Let's do that I like it 

Guy2: How to get over your ex.

Boss:Throws him out of the window but does the video anyway
Thank you for the video... 

Actually today My ex rejected my handmade candy.. And i got sad. I'll try harder to forget about him
When you get dumped at the stroke of midnight of Valentines Day ending a 2 year relationship. This is exactly what I needed. Thanks guys ♥
Men really never get over their ex. Mainly due to lack of support and the coping mechanism of hiding everything
U guys r literally the best couple of youtube so far.
Wow I thought people """""loved""""" my air quotations!
Ex ...nooo 
Who wanna be my next ? 😅😅
This is perfect timing wtf
I needed this... My boyfriend of 2 years broke up with my in January, and this he told me he already has a new girlfriend. It feels like a set back, because I was healing from the breakup but this threw me off completely and I felt betrayed...
Broke up with my girlfriend 2 months ago. She got a new guy already we dated for a year. It killllllllled me to see her with another man, but I realized she’s just chasing her happiness and I need to do the same. I muted her and all her friends on Instagram (people don’t know when you mute them). Not seeing her all over my timeline helps so much. I still see her out usually once a week, but since I did that I’ve gotten back to my old confident self. Don’t let your ex hold you back. Spend times with friends and family. Workout and get out of the house as much as you can. It’s all a numbers game.
One minute of silence for all the people who got rejected or broken up with today
#ValentinesDaySpecial
Just in time. I had to dump my gf that lived with me. It hurts but it had to be done

Can't get an ex if you don't get a girlfriend


*Black man taps his right temple
I got over my X by replacing it with a x.
Simple solution: sleep with their best friend, film it then post it on Pornhub.
You people do realize they probably posted this on V-day on purpose, right? That they do have control of what and when they post, correct?
Wht an irony...it was released on valentines day..
Broke up with my girlfriend, since she deleted my fortnite acc

I got over mine easily. She was clingier than Saran wrap. I dumped her because she was clingy and shallow. She mostly liked me for my looks.
=[ not even my mom wants to be my valentine today
Thank you
The ending was not funny
Lol
How to get over when my boyfriend died?
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing!
but weed would help!
Ironically, i had forgot about my ex. But then i saw this video and it reminded me of her. 
Now my head is spinning. 
Thanks asap science!
Ahhhh nooo. This got uploaded at the wrong time. Lol. My girlfriend and I are going through some stuff and I'm so scared were gonna split. Been together just over three years
Thanks for reminding me.
Posting this video today??? That's so crazy
Ex’s = 😥😩💔😑🙄🤪🤬
Different strokes.....I just kept loving her, wished her well, and moved on. Not easy, but doable. Then met another great girl, without the baggage of denying the past. Life goes on.😊
Simple: Buy a salmon and feed it to a bear.

DO. NOT. TAKE THOSE PILLS. My dad got hooked on painkillers at like 13. Was in rehab twice before he graduated. DON'T EVEN TRY IT.
I could have used this information four years ago, I made pretty much all of the cliches that they illustrated.
Just remember that things could be worse.
GUYS!!!! You nearly gave me a heart attack when you said you broke up.
Careful with that Tylenol 💊
I need tylenol
What is this Ex?

BRUTAL
See, if nobody likes you and you never had, have or will have a girlfriend or boyfriend, like it is the case with me, then you won't have to cope with parting ;)
These comments are depressing...
ty
Find another one
Girls aren’t real
i took tylenol
with alcohol
a lot
of both
at the same time
i'm writing this from the grave
My ex used to send me love letters occasionally as we were in a LDR, these letters are in thousands and it’s pure love, her family didn’t like me and in my community she couldn’t just run from then as they’ve already threatened to cut her throat. The first thing I did to move on is burning all the letters, then changed my number, my social accounts, then removed every associated picture to her “even if it was my picture but had to do with her” that was 2 years ago, hope she founded someone good by now.
I really needed this,thanks,ASAP Science!
One solution: Heavy Metal
Why do we get anxiety and why can’t we control it???😭
can't get an ex if you never get into a relationship.... damn it
I've never had an Ex... 😂
Well, I guess not having to deal with this shit is one advantage of not having an ex.
I'll never get over them
Thank you❤
Perfect valentine gift!!!
Yea
Spending Valentine’s Day in the doctor and freshly broken up with :-) hope you guys have a better one! Celebrate the love this year!
What ex?
ASAP science please make a video on how you dogs are going to change and evolve in the future bc we’re always on our phones, even if it’s an unpopular topic. My dog seems sad when she sees that I’m sitting on the couch looking at my phone and it makes me think about how dog owners used to be. I could just be crazy but it might be a cool video?
Nothing like turning to alcohol and drunk dialing your ex on Valentine’s Day. Thanks
Is it healthy to remain platonic friends afterward?
But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself. ÷
I really needed this on valantines day..... :(
Well HAPPY FREAKING VALENTINES DAY THEN KIDS hahahahhahahhahahahahahahhahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahhaahahahahhahahahaahaahhhaahahahahhahaha
As an aromantic I loved the "ALMOST everyone experiences romantic love..." not EVERYONE

Can you make better quality videos? This is irrelevant to any important science.
What did the librarian say to the students?
Pewdiepie
Soooo ASAP science guys, which one of you is bottom?
I mean depending on circumstance aren't we all capable of murder?
Erased half of the universe.
I just killed millions of lives today by using hand sanatizers
Watching a Tik Tok ad before this definetly lets me know I’m capable of murder.
Pfff who kills humans nowadays 

We all kill nature now
Can't wait to read all the comments from the super edgy 13 year olds saying how they are psychopaths that don't feel any remorse and would be capable of killing someone
I HAVE THE POWER OF GOD AND ANIME ON MY SIDE
shane dawson joined the chat
FBI has entered the chat
Nah... too much work.
just killed 2 creepers and an enderman watch out y'all.
I actually murder people 



In GTA V
Women actually murder at the same rate as men, they just don't get caught because they know how to get blood stains out.

(Not original)
Everyone's a killer we just haven't been pushed to the edge
If it doesn’t involve me getting out of bed, probably
"Have you ever thought about it before?" About self murder?yeah i did, after every minor inconvenience that happens in my life
I mean I got 10 kills on Minecraft hunger games 






Does that count
Is your heart beating fast now? 

Me: no? 

.... Uh ohhh, you're next asap science 👀👀😀
Someone "why are u fat?"
Me: 2:13
Last night I murdered some spaghetti with meatballs so I am already John wick murderer level
Yup.     I killed 3 mosquitoes in a row today
Yes I am , I once ran over innocent people then drove off and killed the cops who were chasing me . 






When I finally got 5 stars I quit the game
This video was more on the general psychology of killing. Murder is different than regular killing, because it involves a plan. It the right situation anyone could kill, but it is something else to carry out a death plot.
I have over 3000 kills




In Fortnite solo
You better watch out, I just killed a fly 💪🏽
Uh my heart isn’t beating fast 




Send help
The first and second point already proves I'm a killer.......
I thought this was about if an average person could actually kill someone, like can they even hit hard enough, do they even know how? A more interesting question: do they know how to get away with it?
Anyone here after killing someone
Low heart rate= stalking
Soo thats why I want to stalk all my teachers on facebook
Are you capable of murder?


Me: ehhh no


Watches video anyway
How do you make a murderer? It depends on a mixture of certain types of the following:

- genes/personality
- how your raised
- environmental factors (bad environments, negative influence, etc)
- traumatic experiences
- abuse
- mental illness
- brain injury
- drugs/alcohol

With a mixture of some of these specific factors, you get a murderer. Its not like just anyone is capable of murder. There are certain people who are given just the right rare mixture that makes them one. And there are different recipes.
When my swim coach makes practice at 5:30 am then I want to commit toaster bath.
Idk if I’d be capable of murder but I’m always thinking about how I’d cover it up if I did kill someone 🤷🏻‍♂️
I get nauseous at just the sight of blood. 

Murder pfft.

On fortine

Crap.

According to this video, I’m gonna kill someone.
I have fingers to pull a trigger 
The power to stab someone 
Anyone does even children
You are better than my science teacher!!
Yes. Being women is a major quality
Me before watching the video: Probably
Me after watching the video: I WAS JOKING
Correlation =/= causation.  Oy.
I know i am capable  of it cuz my older brother
Teacher: I'm capable of killing my students with Exams assignments etc.
Doing nothing: am I joke to you?
Yeah i once mudered 23 people 
I was in the library and the librarian said

I’m able to kill the mood in any situation.
Bruh I feel bad when I kill an ant.
Well I killed an mosquito it bit me 3 times
Me: reads title 
Also me: who says I haven’t already
Here in germany only 4.5% of murder cases go unsolved
Just read Angel Acuna’s comment, so true tho
Video idea: how headphones get tangled in your pocket
im willing to kill someone if it had a GOOD ending...
for example...

john: im gonna nuke alabama

Depending on the circumstances
Yes, yes I am indeed capable of murder. 
I killed a 2 housefly's that wouldn't get off my keyboard

Watching this video will get you on the FBI watch list
As one italian men said
It's All Matter Of perspective

*Frolic starts to play
Yes, I've already killed like 5 people. I think the most important thing in life is your kill count.
The FBI is monitoring this video and your device
I swear, this channel has started to raise questions.

Yes, but I won't, cuz that's be wrong. 




Also I don't want to go to jail.
" is ur heart beating?"
"no"
"then ur safe!"
welp..
No I could never kill
So primates are naturally murderous 

That explains a lot:
Lmao
"If you are a man, you are more likely to murder"
Nice double standards
There is someone 7 more likely to murder you




Yourself
HI. SO I was thinking that the videos that you guys are posting have a lot of talk about statistics. There is a lot of correlation data that you present, which while definitely is related to the title of the video, but presents no real story or arguments. They seem to be a bunch of statistics sewn together under a common title. Moreover, the videos follow a very cookie cutter structure which is common for the videos that you guys are making. Being a long standing fan of the channel, I feel I would love it more if the structure changed a bit. If there is more story telling weaved into the scripts which leads to some argument that you are making. Otherwise, it just feels like a bunch of cool drawings and statistics form different studies.
"And even games".. laughs in Despair That's what Danganronpa is about!

The villains/antagonists/murderers in the Danganronpa games are probably my favourite characters.

When the "blackened" is revealed and voted against and found guilty, Monokuma provides an execution tailored to them. (Monokuma is the Principal who an evil monochromatic bear, set in the Hope's Peak Academy).

Trigger Happy Havoc - Killing your twin sister out of entertainment is a great way to get the audience to watch. It's a shame the Mastermind craved that much despair that they did this action to their twin sister.

Goodbye Despair - Accidental murder has its consequences, those relating to Teruteru Hanamura and Chiaki Nanami. RIP. Getting emotionally attached to those special characters with interesting talents and having those characters die or be executed can be upsetting for most.

Killing Harmony - The game where you have an overly sexual Inventor and the rivalry/ships between particular characters is interesting. The plot twist in the first Chapter will break your heart and break a significant character's heart. (The Mastermind of this killing game is one of my favourite characters) (Also, yay for a female protagonist and emo hats!) Also, this game features the ability to lie during the Class Trials, as the whole game is revolved around lies and the killing game itself. 

Anyone else here like Danganronpa? UwU
My heart didn't beat faster when you said 😂😂 but I'm too lazy to work on that
I can’t always roll a 20 whenever I sneak up on someone
The closest I ever came to murder was holding an Oreo below the surface of milk until the bubbles stopped. 😁
In Iceland most childeren are fed cod-liver oil called "Lýsi" which is pretty much entirely comprised of Omega-3 fatty acids, and Iceland also has the globally lowest murder-per capita rate. 🙌 go us 🇮🇸
More guns==More safety,well done
Please make video on dark web
I got murder on my mind.
I have thought killing my family.

I once decapitated a fish and sliced a sea lamprey in half but it was already dead soooo.... 








liKe AnD SUbScRiBe
I only dream of killing murderers after a homicide episode
Everyone is capable of murder 

Some people just don’t get away with it or they feel bad after
Yeah i once mudered 23 people 







*IN PUBG*'
Yes. Everyone has murdered. If you’ve hated someone, you’ve killed them in your heart

"Is your heart beating fast?"
I have a resting heart rate in the low 50 most of the time. So I guess all my jokes about being able to have a good career as a sniper are not so much jokes.  🤷‍♀️
Killed like 40 somethin people tdy

>Lowest resting heart rate were 39% more likely for violent crime
>Checks Fitbit

Okay
Anyone is......
But most people know how to control themselves.
BUT everyone has their Breaking Point.
Maybe I can't murder you in real life, but I can steal your diamonds and then murder you in Minecraft.
Technically everyone is capable of murder under the right conditions. 
We are expected to do it as soldiers, and taking an actual life is as easy as pulling the trigger. 
The actual realization of killing only gets dulled when the reality of the guilt fades away and either you are consumed with the idea to survive or you lost your sense of compassion for such things. 
Its scary to think about, and a question we must all eventually come to turns with. 
There's no running from your actions when they are clear in your mind.
"When you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing" - John J. Rambo
With all that jumping to conclusions you'd think they'd be fast enough by now. Haha
You can commit murder, ya know and possible not get away with it.

You're not you when you're hungry

No, I’m very sensitive.
I seriously wish the purge would be real. 
I already know who would be my first victim lmao.
My heart rate was slow..... Dont come near me for your own good
Well technically yeah if you murder someone
Oh I definitely am. If I really REALLY wanted to and was dedicated enough, I totally could. I would just feel super guilty after.
THE FBI WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
I already know I'm capable in the right setting.

You have the answer to question I didn't even know I asked
I attack one of my girlfriend's male friends because he was getting a bit too close before and left him knocked out in the snow






is that bad
Can you make a video about domestic abuse?
Yep. Take my snickers, I take your life. #yournotyouwhenyourhungry
Umm, we prefer "stabbie stabbie" or "unsolicited influx of sharpie sharpie" or "socially awkward conversation initiation", thank you. Murder just sounds so violent outside my safety bubble... And remember, it was never about stabbing Caesar, it was about coming together as a group to stab Caesar. Activities are best done with friends!
Dam my hart went form 0 to 80 in no time grate vid
i killed an ant today
The only thing stopping me from murder according to the video is that I'm broke. 😭😭😂😂
i once murdered an entire colony of ants near my house.
yeah...alot of problems with this but i love the channel
"In a military hose with a lower resting heart rate are more likely to commit a crime."

No shit they're the only ones fit enough to make it to the army.
FUK YEA I AM



Edit: ofc in gta
I’m not capable of murder




oR aM i? 
Yes. My friends are scared of me
I hog tied someone and put them on a train track and waited for the train to run them over...



In red dead 2 haha
Me making some art while watching 
Lol
I have murdered over 200 people...








In Uncharted 4
Shit.. this video inspires me of murder.






Edit: it is called a joke.
This was surprisingly accurate.
That Segway felt super forced
I have a confession.... I killed... 2 spiders and at least 5 bugs today 😔😓😭
I was wondering, has this video's monetization been impacted by its subject?
I got 100% right but would not have otherwise guessed for one second that AI were involved
The comments are so edgy, most people would feel too much guilt.
2:25
It’s Sunday today 
hides in closet with water and food
Okay I'm aggressive af, slow heartbeat and I was abused, fun!
every time i play a videogame?
Murder is human nature. We all are CAPABLEE!!
i will admit, i regularly think about the movie "Hostel" and what i would do.
Im capable of destroying the whole world




President of Russia...
Capable?? Have already killed my best friend for a million bucks on fb😁
This is really cool but I could definitely kill someone the second they are an immediate threat to my baby
What I've learn that serial killers are more likely to be born in Nov
Yes I am capable of murder, No I am not sarcastic
I will do anything for my senpai even if I have to kill my best friend...
I got murder on my mindddddddd
I killed 100 in just 1 day
The video didn't answer the question
"mEn arEn'T viOLEnT"
the thumbnail scared me—
Dont give us ideas ASAP. We might start with you guys first >:) (lol no dont call 911 on me)
I squashed an ant earlier today.
Wow it's been years since I've been on this channel
My heart didn't beat fast lol.
If you have a clean record, it should be safe to kill a complete stranger, with only the motive to kill a stranger.. Not sure why you'd do it, but the chances of getting caught are pretty low if you use a bit of brainpower.
I definitely want to kill on Sundays thinking about the work week ahead 😭😭😭😭
I only fantasize about killing myself
My heat began beating quickly after I realized my heart wasn’t beating as quickly as I thought it would be...
I feel like I'm on some kind of a watchlist now.
Murdering? Killing? Same difference, am I right?
you guys really couldn't have picked a better time to post this video! im currently doing a project on the psychological factors that lead to major/violent crimes such as murder for my psych class. thank you guys so much! i will definitely be using this as one of my resource materials :)
Short Answer: Yes.
I'm capable of murdering myself.
everyone is a killer, you just gotta push them to their limits
What if I told you, thinking about murder every day is not good.
my resting heartrate is literally 53 bpm
welp lol
Of course murder is an evolutionary strategy, it's pretty obvious. In the early years of human existence, men, being physically superior to women, used it as a method to get what they wanted. Women are hardly capable of doing physical damage to a man.

Also, it is a good demonstration of how well you could protect your family in an emergency. If someone came to your cave demanding your food, killing him to defend your property was pretty much the only solution.
I once chatted with a former French foreign legion sniper, I asked him what he felt the first time he shot someone.
His answer was "the recoil of the rifle"
lmao i cant even hurt a fly im scared of insects let alone kill someone jeeeeeez
I'm sorry, but I don't think that saying that lethal violence increases with evolution is correct. I think what you guys meant was that most recent species have higher rates of killing individuals of their own species. I think that all creature that lives in the present moment have the same degree of evolution, from a cladistics point of view.

Can anyone tell me if I'm wrong, please?

Also, sorry for the possible bad English, it's not my mother tongue. If someone found an error, please, tell me so I can improve.
FBI, don't mind me
* Jeffrey dahmer and ted bundy have joined the chat*
“Are You Capable Of Murder?” 
“Yes.”
My resting heart rate is at or below 60 bpm 🔪
I Am very capable of killing, but won't do that unless I'm somewhat forced into it, like attempted abuse of any sort.
Dear FBI agent,
 I’d never kill someone plz don’t raid my house.
The narrator sound more mature 🤔
I have an Apple Watch on Rn and my heart rate was 97
Y did my heart start beating fast tho
I came for the periodic table song ;-;
Is that why undead monsters who don’t have a heartbeat always want to kill??? 🤔
I had to do it... I killed TimCreepYt in call of duty😭

Make a video on rabies.....
i got murder on my mind
Yes, I think I'm capable of. Been murdered countless innocent lives daily every month except on November.
"Is your heart beating fast right now?"
me: no
"Then you're probably safe"
me: ._.
Only my Parasyte the Maxim boys will understand that if your life is at risk then you have to do whatever it takes to make sure you come out alive. So my life is my top priority.
I mean you take that chance every time you fight someone. 
I don't mess around either, you get into a fight by jumping me, well I know how to fight a little, but I will defend myself and neutralize a target in whichever way possible. Violence is never a solution, its a means to an end, and results in an end.
Can you make a video for how to remove body hair permanently
Me: Yeah I could totally off a guy if I wanted to
Me: Slightly bumps into someone
Me: Oh are you okay?!?!? I’m so sorry please don’t hate me I didn’t mean to hurt you!!!!!
Women are less likely to murder because they couldn't as easily if they tried.
So athletes are more likely to kill.
On GTA I am
Your videos have been getting pretty sucky lately. Step it up.
Wow! well I'm happy I am not capable of murder lol scary stuff here
many pro choice women were capable
seems like omega-3 fatty acid is the only way to stop murders🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Superbowl sure was capable of murder

It was the first thing i thought of when i saw the notification.
My heart wasn’t beating fast..
Immediate click. XD
people only had 3-10 murder fantasies a year? i’m either a psychopath or a lazy serial killer..
Heart beat didn’t raise

Guess I’m serial killer

My heart didn't beat fast 😨
er guys what’s the classical song in the background because it slaps
Hi Greg nice to hear you again
It depends who's asking...
1:04
A low resting heart rate increases the chance of ...MURDER?
Come on guys, I think you blew it on this.
My resting heart rate is 55-60 beats a minute and I am not violent at all and never killed anyone....
This is a VERY silly analysis
Eh my heart rate was slow...
You cannot argue that losing a father has NO COST to survival that is obviously wrong and confines a patriarchal myth that is discriminatory against men.
never murdered anyone but this video described me mostly, my resting heart rate is 51 according to my fitbit :D
Now this is what u call hangry
Can you guys talk about salt addiction cuz i have one i use allot of salt on most of my food. I barely drink a glass of water a day and i only eat 1 meal a day
I dream of killing people all the time.. I usually dream I’m a grim reaper tho or I have been taken over by the dark lord 🤷🏽‍♀️
I think we're ALL capable of murder.
Given Situation, everyone is capable of murder... The main thing is how you feel after it.
Hell yeah I'd kill somebody if I didnt get Locked up
Of course I am capable!
I literally butchered my life.
I believe everybody is. I don't even think it's a question to be brought up in any field f science. More as a realisation of the epitome of what we call our "dark sides". Sometimes those "dark sides" serve us well. Imagine having to kill an intruder before she/he kills a member of your household. I'd bet you'd enjoy watching the life force run out of their eyes.
What does it means when my heart is beating very slowly
Yes, yes I am capable of murder. I’ve thought about it everyday,But I got video games and workouts to relive my thoughts.
i thought about murder 





with the death note
I've yet to have ever wanted or thought to kill someone I've known or met. I don't think I will ever want to or think about it. Too much work. Too much anxiety. If it was for survival then there is a possibility.
This is the same question I ask myself when I'm holding a knife.
oh yeah yeah
10 per year ? I've already used all of them, what now?
My resting HR is 30- I'm going to jail
Easier said than done, I have been in a kind of situation before that involves murder, I was beaten to pulp and I couldn't do anything as If I tried, it would have only killed the person. So it's not easily done without experience.
Sunday is so dangerous because of the self entitled church people coming out of church and being rude and disrespectful to other people 😂
I own a switch blade but I don’t think I’ll murder someone with it but I would use it if necessary for home protection.
Okay I’m a cereal killer 







I ate cereal this morning 😁

very great transitions between topics!
Jeez I got to be careful
Yes, i think of killing people on daily basis
Probably higher of a percentage of children who are abused grow up to abuse. Love yourself and your children. Teach critical thought and eat fish! Lol seriously though, it’s easier to prevent murderers than it is to change murderers.
Not really. I mean I'll stand my ground and if I kill someone in a fight I guess that's it, it will not be intended. But in the most of the times I chose not to fight and talk my way out of the situation. Just why I don't join military. That and I can't keep my hair long.
Hell ya, we are all guilt of mens rea
Yeah, as long as I'm murdering myself.
Everyone is capable of murder. It’s really not that hard to kill someone especially if you know them because they never suspect it. However, it’s not whether we’re capable it’s whether we’re willing to murder. I wouldn’t kill anyone because I’m not willing to commit a crime or take someone’s life but if I really really wanted to and I didn’t care I could think of a few ways. 🙃
Every single person is capable of murder. Even the sweetest, meekest person can be dangerous, if the circumstances are right, if the right buttons are pushed, if the conditions of that persons life are in such despair, it is humanly possible. 

All it takes is just one bad day.
Yes. I am.
You guys should make a video about dipping (smokeless tobacco). How it puts nicotine into your bloodstream and compare it with smoking and what happens when you quit. Ive seen your videos about what happens when you quit smoking, and a lot of it applies to dipping but obviously there is differences. I feel like there is not many videos about it even though it is just as bad as smoking and a large percent of people do it and could use the information.
Lol, leave it to non-murderers to determine who and who isn’t capable of murder... 😂😂😂
Once i went on a triple kill
Is it creepy that I got everything pointing at me being capable?
3:12 cause we know how to get blood of things well ;)
Remember, no russian
The guilt would eat me up from the inside. I would have confessed before I know it.
I'll tell you after school.....

Lmfaoo so apparently i will probably kill someone.
I'm scars my heart rate is low
Well... I think that my profile picture and my name will tell you if I am capable of murder......... 😂😅
I don't understand how so many people can be shocked by serial killers and yet so accepting of the military. To kill someone for a thrill or because you're mentally unstable isn't any more horrific than travelling to distant countries with the intention of murdering strangers and their families because your government told you to.
Has anyone here actually killed? Perhaps a member of military?
Of course I'm capable of murder. Those who aren't capable of murder are too soft. I might be a psychopath....
why question me like dat?
Umm...
No

I wake up in the morning, i got murder on my mind
No, I can proudly say that I'm incapable of murder.

I'm also incapable of getting a girl to go on a date with me, but I'm much less proud of that fact...
nah...only capable at staring at my computer deleting my history
Nice job scaring everyone.
If you work in customer service, yes.
4:43-4:47 hell yeah it's creepy and it just became worse because you just said I wasn't the only one who failed to guess (for me it was about 60% wrong but I think that's because on the test the "real" photos and audio, video that was selected had certain elements that made me think they was created by Artificial Inteligence, that's was probable on purpose, the dudes that created that test had a point to make, so the "real" was probably selected carefully according to what the A.I. created so that they trick you to think that the real is the fake one, maybe I should rewatch the video so that I can find how it was done).
Wow, 33% success rate? Hmm... interesting...

I think next time a man thinks to say that women aren’t fit for a position because they’re too “emotional,” they should consider the fact that 85.3% of all murders are committed by men; most of which are in an emotional outburst.
you just gave us a bunch of stats and numbers, I still don't know if I m capable of murder

That low heart rate correlation sounds interesting but is there anything resembling a causal link between them? Like could it be an outcome of the abuse serial killers are more likely to have experienced?
Yeah, I could kill someone. Everyone could kill someone
I'm watching this on a Sunday
My watch says i have a heart rate of 83. Which is my normal when awake. My resting is as low at 57 when asleep.
I would be too scared to kill someone. unless I had to do it for a valid reason, I would.
Imagine if facts were opposite nd women accuse of more murders. Thn I'm sure there wud be several calls to ban this channel by feministos. But don't worry majority of the ppl understnd tht science is fact as I Do. Nd we shud find ways to knw of atleast reason behind it or  lower these cases in men.
Child abuse is the factor for increasing murder🤔?!
The artificial intelligence part reminded me of the Shane Dawson video

I was under the impression that a lower resting heart rate was indicative of good cardiovascular health
I killed 1000 in fortnite
Or a lower resting heart rate could be correlated with higher fitness and it could just be a coincidence that stronger people commit more violent crime

Maybe we're (women) just better at not getting caught?

Does doing Brazilian jujitsu with your partner get included with the strangulation because it's a sport that bonds people but it also has chokes
"Is your heart beating right now?" (No) 


Many people are capable of many things and many are not. But theres no good reason to put yourself in the lines of potential death or prison and a life of super caution where you would probably get caught in the end then your in prison having to join a gang and killing people becuase you have to and living like a dog on a chain in a concrete box.
I read the thumbnail as ''are you Gapable of murder''
im a vegetarian and i tried eating fish but i got a emotional breakdown and couldn’t do it.
Sometimes i wish i was
Lol my heart wasn’t beating fast
Yea it's not that deep
Murders happen when the benefits of it outweigh the costs. Logical, but terrifying
More men are deemed murders because they are persuaded and coarsedad to by women to kill. 
Women are better at getting away with it. 
Love,  lust,  and the pursuit of making one happy play a part in women's crime involving a male person doing the deep for her so she wouldn't get her hands dirty.
I was literally thinking of this for the past week
i killed 99.9% of bacteria
I was wondering...







ex. when my sister was going away she said goodbye and briefly woke me up. Later when i woke up i didn’t remember it
This is gonna look sus asf on my watch history.
Being capable of murder is not even wrong though,. And having thoughts of murder doesnt mean someone is capable of murder, its just a way to release an anger u have in a extreme way to heal the anger.
When you went into men vs women I was disappointed about you not talking about racial differences 😏😏😏
Science of depression and how  genetics can have a part in it.
I wouldn't kill someone because you're bound to be caught in this day and age. I'm not opposed to murder per se, but I would probably kill myself after the act if I ever seriously considered it.
Self defence or protecting your child  can turn anyone into a murderer.I know for a damn fact i am not about to kill someone  just to do it. Thats stupid and not worth it. That being said if i saw a family member in a situation that would trigger my fight or flight , i always defend my family and in regards to humans , my fight or flight always goes for fight... It is just human nature to protect your bloodline and yourself.
These guys are the real real
Honestly it would be pretty easy just saying if u are smart about it

Mr. Ted Bundy
Is that a CHALLENGE?? easy dubs
Does murder by defending yourself (or a loved one) count?
A more likely reason for men committing more violent crime/murder is to do with aggression levels in general. Studies have found that if you were asked to pick the more aggressive person between a randomly selected male and female and picked the male, you’d be correct about 60% of the time. While a 60:40 ratio doesn’t seem like a massive difference, at the tail (extreme) ends of a distribution (generally only the most aggressive people commit violent crime) this stat is amplified massively to about a 90:10 male:female ratio.
Why is my heartrate so low??? Im scared
jokes on you bc the only thing I can kill is the mood
People stopped liking or believing you guys after "The science of racism"
Me me murder boy
Someone tell me I’m not the only one who put my hand on my chest trying to feel my heart beat and see if it was fast enough.
Who came here by pressing the video link.
I would get really tense and have a gigantic hole in me when I do something Not Me
Welp the fact that I am emotionless kiling in video games says a lot though.
I accidentally murdered an ant.... Now I feel bad
everyone is a killer, you just gotta push them to there limit.
Everybody's a killer if they get pushed to the limit
lmao a gene
Yes. Yes I am.
Youtube recording this to me...
3:11 because evolutionarily speaking, us men are stronger and more naturally ready to fight, and with that, comes the ability to kill easier. On top of that, most males are more intrigued by violence than women, as men have always been the ones who hunted and defended. I’m not saying all men are murderous psychopaths, but I am saying we’re more likely to be
I'm more of a overkill due to self defense kinda guy.
I am watching this on a Sunday and now I am afraid
I use to think about murder A Lot growing up. Especially about the ppl I knew. When I was 4 yrs old I tried to put a pillow over my brother's head. He  must've been 4 to 5 months old at  the time. I grabbed a  pillow and started to walk slowly towards him almost like in a tip toe style. He was laying on his back in a bed with his head turned facing the other side of the room. The bed sit kinda low to the floor so I could reach him. I was a few inches from his face with the pillow and my mom appeared out of nowhere. In that moment with in a split second she punched me in my stomach. I slid across the floor in one direction and the pillow went flying the other way. She knocked the wind out of me and snatched my brother up in her arms. I laid there balled up, clutching my stomach and trying to catch my breath. She was standing on the other side of the room holding my brother. She was pacing back and forth  yelling and talking crap but after a few words into it I zoned out. At the age of 4 I knew Exactly what I was doing and Understood what the results would be from my actions. I wanted to kill him and tried to do it. I was the Only child before he came along and I wasn't excited about him coming into the picture. Well my mother met my stepdad and married him when I was 5 to 6 years old and Contuied to shit out 3 More kids like a dog that's having puppies and Robbed me out of my childhood, at a very young age. I became the second parent, maid, tutor, and live in baby sitter with adult responsibilites taking care of my 4 siblings. Keep in mind my mother and step parent (when she met him things went from bad to worse) mentally, physically, emotionally abused and neglected us through out our childhood. I was also sexual abused by family and friends of the family. It's been 23 years since I seen my mother. I cut ties with all off them except 1 and I don't ever plan on seeing them anytime soon.
I have no heartbeat so my gonna kill some body.
Umm. I like seeing people suffer. Is that bad?..
Hm 50% does 86%
i cannot find the reference for the 1.33% claimed on 4:19, seems a bit high, in The netherlands only 0,088% of all deaths were contributed to violence. but maybe that are the perks of living in a safe country.
It’s pretty easy. I just snap
Capitalism, Patriarchy      =      abuse
Hey ASAP Science, how do pills work, like when a doctor proscribeds medication, how does it work with the body?
My nerd friend sent me here.
Damn I must be a man cause I get wayyy more than 3 😂😂
short answer... yes
I think I have the warrior gene. I have aggression but i am also empathetic. I do have thoughts but i just laugh them off and push them aside. Do I think i'm capable? Probably, probably not. Anyone can do it in a blink of an eye, intentional or accidental". My aggression is out of survival, i was raised around fighting back growing up, not by my family because they weren't physically abusive, especially not my father, my mother, though, was emotional abusive which plagued me still at the age of 24. Killing, for me, would be in a choice of survival, not out of being crazy, if I were to ever kill someone, it would be to save someone's life or my own. that's all i can say. other people might have different motives, but i don't speak for them
i have 3 kills in fortnite
If I got them all correct am I a guaranteed murderer
One of my cats killed my other cat
Ordinary Men
They can definitively say: “If you’re a man you’re more likely to murder” 

They somehow definitely can’t say: “If you’re black you’re more likely to murder.”
I think I am.. But I would never unless I protect my own life or the life of an innocent person
Yes...
Will commit murder for profit.
“Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her!”
- Candy Groves
(I will like my own comment...)
Wait, if 1% of all deaths are murders and everybody dies, that'd make the murder rate 1/100. That looks wrong to me.
I'd do a genocide to save my family and loved ones if needed, not just kill someone
Well, women know how to clean blood stains... So I'm not surprised women are less murderous, at least according to the records.. If it happens but didn't get added to statistics, it still happened.
(Then again, most women committing murder use poison. But I'm still just throwing it out there...)
"Did MAO-A variant status predict antisocial behavior in twenty-six-year-olds (as measured by a composite of standard psychological assessments and convictions for violent crimes)? No. But MAO-A status coupled with something else powerfully did. Having the low-activity version of MAO-A tripled the likelihood . . . but only in people with a history of severe childhood abuse. And if there was no such history, the variant was not predictive of anything."

That's from a book Greg was claiming to read (Behave by Robert Sapolsky) on Sidenote a ways back.  Looks like it's Greg that needs to be read for not absorbing the damned book.
I personally know two people who have murdered before. They're both in prison rn
My gf have army Gene lol
I'll definitively torture and murder anyone or anything that makes my cat sad.
I bet this will be trending soon.
Doesn't matter... anyone can be a murderer... statistics mean nothing... anyone can kill...
GRIM joined the chat
Men are more likely to murder?

...don’t tell the feminist...

Edit: god damn didn’t know some people would be stupid enough to not see this as a joke
Yes...I am
I’d be too anxious to murder people
I’d be like “Did I get all my fingerprints off?” “Oh no, did anyone see me?” “Oh my gosh I think I hear someone.” 
“WHO’S THERE?”
I don't know anyone incapable of murder... given the right circumstances anyone is capable of murder.
Someone attacks your child and the only way to save your girl is killing the attacker, you tell me you won't?...
If you are starving, if someone attacks you, etc... etc...
EVRYONE can lol if ww3 starts right now.  I would obviously fight for my country uk. Kill if necessary but I can never injure an innocent human being let alone murder.
Is murdering a Villager included?
2:10 Couldn't you increase just 1% there ?
You can't possibly be trying to link murder rates with heartbeat.
I have a question....

Why do we eat and drink when it’s all going to come out any ways. Why is pee yellow and poop brown when you eat something weirdly coloured. Is there any answer to this? Can someone tell me
Welcome back to why the hell is this on my recommended number 237#
I am a warrior
I doubt I could kill someone cause 
1. I won't even kill a bee
2. I don't want to drive just in case I accidentally kill someone or cause them harm
watches the video on sunday
When I get triggered, yes.
REDRUM
Ok youtube, I saw it.
FBI open up!
I'm afraid to finish vvatching this
Raskolnikov has left the chat
I would kill if it were necessary to protect my family or anyone innocent for that matter. Or I would just break many many bones. Whichever works first.
It seems I'm Gonna murder somebody.
Yeah but I'd go to jail lol
Got to love Raine et al study about Brian functions leading to aggressive behaviour! What I’ve learnt in psychology shows all of us are capable of murder, ranging from use of role models when we were younger, childhood and genetics etc. This video was very interesting!
I feel like I’m going to be on a list now
I am  in  Kate
For fuck's sake, I'm telling you, my Danganronpa marathon doesn't mean anything at all!!!
gets law and order ad
Imma have a resting heart rate of 110, I ain’t gonna do anything!!
I think the word you’re looking for is mukduk
At the end u probably got that from Shane Dawson just saying
Sunday has the highest murder rate? How ironic.
Men commit most murders, it only makes sense that we lock them up.
what is with my recommended these days?
Did anyone else notice the extra hand at 2:20?
I once murdered someone...




I killed my cake T^T
I do love her a lot but i wouldn't murder anyone
The statistics about heart rate are 100% linked to height
Was gunna break up with my boyfriend this weekend... He's told me he has a violent/angry past... Thinking maybe I shouldn't do it on a Sunday now 😅
Just become a cop
Murder? Probably not. Self defense? No question.
siiiickk now im on a watchlist
Yandere-Chan.exe has started
Every human on the earth is capable of murder if forced into a life or death situation. Just ask John Kramer

Sure. For the right person
I got murder on my mind
I am as capable of killing as everyone else.
Everyone is capable of murder, but only if they have the desire to do it
Is a bit scared about murder
I feel like I want to murder someone... Have some fish
Shit my heart rate is at like 70 BPM that’s quite low right I’m 14

I was watching this on a Sunday.....
I could easily kill someone, I have no real emotions. It might actually stimulate something inside me who knows.
Yes I am.
I think I'd do this only out of retaliation or vengeance. Would never hurt someone that did nothing to me.
13% of the popn, 50% of the murders
Ok but wtf 50% of women victims are killed by romantic/exromantic partners...and y'all tell us not to be scared of men...suuuure
Yes I am capable
Next Video: If you are circumsized, you are 99% capable of shooting up a school.
Excuse me, but fortunately it's not the case that 1,33% of deaths are due to murder. Dear god, what a statement.
Better run better run, faster than my bullet
No too lazy, tired, and too much of a loser
I’m pretty sure watching this vid has placed me on a blacklist and my FBI agent watching me is probably working overtime now
y e s .
stalking behaviour when having a low resting heartrate makes sense, you are a bit more dreamy, not as much in the now tbh which leads to having weird thoughts more often, at least that how Id explain it
Your mission begins when you click read more











Oh hey there 😂 Your mission this year is to be the best you can be. Íiké this comment and śûbśćribé to journey together.
I can murder :)
Next thing you know everyone who watched this video gets arrested
is this a challenge?
Bring back the bouncy music!
My resting heart rates 51... but I’m a long distance runner, but does it still count?
Okayyyyy...I'm a serial killer now.gret
I got murder on my minddddddd ohhh ohhhhh
Hell yeah
10?! Where do people live that they fantasize so little xD
this is a stupid premise, anybody can kill anyone
The real question isn’t are you capable of murder. The real question is are you capable of murder





.
Question;
Why is there no successfull black nations? 😂
I murderd ants by drowning them
Yeah I'm a cereal killer
I eat cereal

(i'm so sorry)
Everyone is a murderer who ever ate another animal.
If you are anti vaxxer than you are capable of murder
I didn’t have a fast heart rate
nice video to make men seem worse than they really are 

i find doubt in that study bc women are also more likely to commit smarter, less detectable murders (and in a female).
We should legalize murder...
i killed 30 people
........................ in cod bo4
So you went from being capable of murder to watching a video about whats fake and whats real? Kind of irrelevant ending..
Anyone can kill someone... Justifiable homicide...  But not everyone can be a MURDERER. Oh I hope I NEVER jave to but yes. I believe if I had no other choice. To save my life or someone else's that I LOVE that couldn't protect themselves.
Weird, this video is saying that I am a murderer but I never killed anyone....

"Lethal violence increased with evolution" makes no sense as a sentence.
I wanna kill my brain cells......with some beer.
terrible choice of music, brah!
Yeah ! But only if someone gets me real mad . Once I  was about to hit a kid with a chair , because he made me really angry , but my classmates stopped me . Good thing i am really peaceful and hardly ever get mad .
Lol nice segway
Here’s a question: what would happen if everyone on earth walked in to the ocean at the same time?
I love murder! It's such a turn on!
I have a fast heart beat after running away from the police. Does this mean I murder?
I'm pretty sure I am.
I mean, I totally could, but my ethics say “hoho-no”

Also I’d get in jail, but mostly due to ethics
It’s obviously disrespectful to end someone’s life
Just put me in a room with the inventor of pineapple pizza and done
I know I am. But I've learned to discipline myself to stop "accidentally" crushing someone's throat and ripping their eyes out with my fingers or ripping their tongues out with pliers.
Stupid question. Anyone who's taken your seat before would have answered this question for you. It's yes.
2:46 That’s why, gentlemen, we need feminism
I killed a ant
Anybody is a murderer you just gotta push em to the limit
Once me and my friends talked about the best way to kill someone and best way to torture someone.... It was actually really fun to talk about.... My mom gave me discusses it to because she wants to study the mind of killers... So I know a lot about how most killers work....
i don't think i can kill a cat
cheese is solid milk
If i have to go out of my room then heck no i wont kill somebody
I mean I murdered flies and bugs...
I don't get what a low heart rate has to do with anything.
Definitely
Am I the only person who hasn't had homicidal thoughts? My friends say I'm strange for not tbh haha
When i was 5 i always tried hard to remember if i had killed anyone and wonder why i hadn't taken a human life instead of my pet bunny
please put a video of your whiteboard animation tutorial
Sunday funday
I think I am.
Macbeth should have watched this video
anyone is capable of murder, its only a matter of how much we need to push you
Propoganda at it's strongest
I kinda don’t like how towards the end it feels like they try to undermine fathers
This ones kinda boring tbh
Physically? Yes of course, the human body is quite fragile, anyone could technically kill someone.
This keeps popping up in my recommended. Umm...
Where was the part about being capable of murder?
Only if  earth gets a superhero... I'd wish it upon a candle for sure.
Im not a killer but dont push me -tupac
EVERYONE IS CAPABLE
Well... We all die 
We either kill ourself or die
... so im more likely to commit murder is what your telling me right now.
I kinda like reading murder/serial killer stories but I actually never fantasize of murdering or even physically hurting someone. If I'm mad I just broke things and that's the most violent act I can do
I wouldn’t be. I’m only a few seconds in but no way.
Idk am I?
i can kill someone very easily without any fear or shaking but i dont haram incconet or kill someone without any reason and iam not scare of anything in whole world and i can control my thoughts feeling and my mind easily how is my gens
When they said that if your heart rate is fast then your safe, I’m like... uhhh my heart isn’t really beating fast rn 😟
Yeah...when I stab my stupid friend then the police men are working to find me then sadly they not because I woke up
Although they only make up 12.7% of the US population...




(This is a joke plz don’t murder me)
Man I can’t even manage my bank account, so I really don’t need the stress of murder on my plate.
Theeres hydrogen and helium
I can’t even get out of bed what makes you think I can kill someone
Why am I watching this at 1 am?
Just say bet and it shall be done
I think anyone is capable of murder. Just to what extent pushes them in doing so
In the trenches where it's real lethal
With regards to the ratio of male to female murderers, there's something to be said for the prevalence of narratives in which the male protagonist uses violence to avenge his honor or get what he wants and does so successfully.
why didnt they count proxy wars as murderers?
Yes.
Hmm... wonder why is this trending on Valentine’s Day!?
Shiiiiit
Y’all really think imagine murdering someone 3-10 times a year? That’s wild to me. I don’t think I’ve ever truly been that upset
I've had this reoccurring dream every time I'm extremely stressed, where I commit a murder, then all I feel is an overwhelming fear of getting caught and go crazy within my dream. But like I cry my eyes out whenever I see the littlest thing in pain it makes no sense does this happen to anyone else??
“33% of murders go unsolved” yeah... that is if you find the body...
No, woman can murder more than men because think about yandere’s all over the world
Yes

I have murdered millions of my kids everyday. 😏

Nurture in a sense is also Nature as you don't get to pick your parents either.

Yeah I think so
only on weekends
Yes
Yes
I would never murder someone but I would kill in defense
when I'm mad at someone I just think of punching them or never talking to a human again. But murder? Uh no thanks, blood is disgusting and even though I don't 100% believe in God, I'd feel really guilty. Except it's like really necessary but I can't imagine a situation where that'd be the case.
Not bothered, ill do it tomorrow
We all are murders in the eyes of God, hateful words is considered murder.. ask for forgiveness in Jesus name
Si😃
Yes
Anybody thinking about killing someone while they’re watching this?
Funny I don’t remember reading about my capability to murder in any of my old school science books.
I am.
Yup
I love salmon so I’m ok.
I will not even watch it... of course we are capable or why would it happen hundreds of thousands of times a day in every country across the world?
redrum
i laugh when playing gta. am i under any danger
only going to compare men and women in the murder stats.
Oh yeah

I have a low heart rate. I think it’s probably because I’m a triathlon runner though.
it aint beating fast looks like someone is gonna die
Have the other guy do the speaking. He has a much better cadence and is easier to listen to
:)
3:21 I actually get that. Most of the time it's the fathers that leave and that does little damage (most of the time) while the mother stays with the kid. Unless the mother put the kid up for adoption it is expected of them to stay with them.
Honestly were all murderers, but were like one of those murderers who pays others to do it for them. I used to pay some guys to kill  hundreds of cows, chickens, pigs, fish, etc.
Almoast anyone is. Didn't watch the vid...didn't need to I am a combat vet. My nation told me some people were bad, told me I should go kill those people, and then I did. Other people come up with their own reasons but at the end of the day it's the same thing. Most people can kill if they just get behind a cause to do so and believe it. If your cause is judged sane you don't go to jail, if not you do.
Yeh umm I sometimes think that I could grab a knife a just stab someone or strangle someone weaker...
Yes
this was boring to watch
Yes
I am sorry , I was busy melting my siblings brain
Humans are way more likely to murder other animals than humans.  There are tons of cows and chickens murdered everyday.
Most humans kill animals for trivial reasons, so killing is normal for us arrogant apes, but we can fight that.
Staby staby :)
Murder seems like fun
Yes
Can an AI commit murder?
Yes
Yes
Can't kill anyone if you don't see anyone
No... too much boredom
I mean. I've thought about killing someone. Most days at least once. Fantasizing about stopping a terrorist attacks, zombie invasion, Russian invasion, you know, common stuff
I've murdered pizza before.
YNW Kelly watched this video fosho
Crime and Punishment. Mmmmhmm
I may not murder but might be murdered




I’m not subscribed to pewdiepie and I never will
No, no, no... I would never be able to murder... Unles it's like bug I guess... But otherwise, I wouldn't be able to even watch someone murder an animal even...
Cool vid but it lacks the snap that Mitch gives it, but don't get me wrong your getting better
1.33% of today's deaths are murders?! How?
Women just hide their kills better 😂😂
So what you're saying is men are trash?
Yes
Of course I'm capable of murder, how else will we get rid of people who play fornite? While they're getting kills in their dumb battle royale shit, I sneak up behind them..
What happens when you only eat tide pods and drink bleach???
Sike, I just murder beats ya feel me?
That’s why everyone goes crazy in every zombie:apocalypse movie
I have a low heart rate i guess I’m a creepy stalker and a murderer
There’s hydrogen and helium...
When I was a kid (6-7), I had a grandma that I hated, and I drew a picture of her with a sniper sign on her face. I don’t remember what made me so mad but I was a crazy kid.
Its kind of sad...Ive had or have half these "symptoms", low heart rate, murder fantasies, child hood abuse, warrior gene, but I am a woman..but I have no children...yet I dont think I could actually kill anyone. I always go above and beyond to nuture everyone I meet...I stand up for myself, dont get me wrong; but Im just not an aggressive person. Id rather just walk away than to deal with whatever problem I come across....guess Im weird
Yes
why is the narrator speaking like a 16 year old valley girl
The statistics were written by a feminist
Wait wait... I thought that women and men were the same.... Should we try to make women more likely to murder in the name of equality?
*YNW Melly has joined the chat*
Is this a challenge?
men like to risk it all
yes
Am I the only one who has never thought of killing someone else? I have thought about suicide a couple times though
Murder is so rude.
I have Almost strangled someone when they had been tormenting me for 6 months I had finally beat them up and they were struggling I decided not to do it because I had to go to some place I didn't want to
What did he mean when he said that chances of murdering increase with evolution? Primates are not more or less evolved than any other species
yes
I thought I unsubscribed why am I still getting videos by this trash “Science”  channel
Perhaps
Is water wet?
Probably
Am I capable of murder? I have no Idea, I have to try and find out
... #exposed
I can only if i really hate them.
Yikes, I should probably see a therapist
Today I killed an ant
yes
Wait, so if I’m healthy enough to have a low resting heart rate, they’re telling me I’m probably a future stalker / murderer?  Guess we have to remind this “SCIENCE” channel that correlation != causation.
Yeet
Science behind Rainbows
"Primates including humans are 6 times more likely to kill their own species than other animals".....well, i guess this statistic Comes from the hunter and gatherer times, today we kill 70.000.000.000 land animals every year, that is 10 times more dead animals than humans live on planet earth.
Does killing yourself count?
WTFrick is this vid
Can’t commit murder but I can commit arson
Yes
Yep
Did you seriously just create a video about murder and cite it as an “evolutionary strategy?”  And not give any argument for why it’s an evolutionary hindrance?  You should age restrict this video, the last thing we need are kids learning that murder is perfectly normal because it came from evolution.  That doesn’t make it alright.  You should definitely make a disclaimer.
Yes we are all capable. And not just murder but commiting evil acts that seem unimaginable. For example most Nazi's were just ordinary people, and if any of you were in their place there would be an extremely high chance you would still have done the same thing as they did.
The reason girls are less likely to murder is because we are never caught... we know how to clean up blood XD
yes
China bad
That’s interesting, I don’t think I’ve had a homicidal thought before which would put me in the minority. Do y’all really just plot murders a couple times every month?
Of course
I can commit baklava
Да yes
Yes
No.
I’m not joking or talking about killing in a game but I actually tried to kill my gran twice, I gave her sleeping pills and smothered her with a pillow the first time it worked she stopped breathing then I couldn’t take it I put her oxygen machine on her as she’s got COPD (lung disease) she needs oxygen to live and breath then I tried to do it again the second time but there wasn’t enough time so I didn’t do it but I’m thinking of doing it the third time it’s time for me to finish the job.
Women actually murder more than men. We’re just not caught cause we learn how to get blood stains out of things at a young age.
In my whole entire life I’ve never wanted to murder sombody bc I can’t handle the thought. Heck I can’t even crush a bug bc of the thought of it dying is to much. Instead I get sombody else to sit it for me so I don’t feel the pain
no
Batman rules! badass Punches only! No killing.
There are so many issues with the science in this video. What is the definition of murder you are using? Several of the studies cited sounded like they had major correlation=causation problems, even from short summaries. I miss old asap science
1:00 wow correlation does not imply causation batman
Probably.
In come the feminists
Woaah, the heart rate one was a textbook example of how correlation does not equal causation. The heart rate probably was linked to something that also made them more likely to kill -- perhaps they were scared of being in the army and therefore more likely to deem a threat as bigger than it is, leading them to kill people out of an instinct to protect themselves. C'mon AsapScience, you guys are better than this!
Please say yes please say yes.....
Where’s the other guy. I like the other guy.
well of course i could but that doesnt mean i want to
Nope
uh uh NO
We always want to solve problems. Sometimes, other humans are the problem. Then, what do we do?
Check your facts humans kill millions if not billions of other animals more than they kill other humans...
No
Don’t wanna go to jail
killing is EZ
CHARA?
all the dislikes are murderers.
I have violent thoughts about the guy who swooped in on a girl I liked, not necessarily murder but brutal torture. Jealousy is one hell of an emotion.
I don't think women are less likely to murder because of their kids but because of misogyny. Women are abused and subjugated every day which causes psychological problems that makes them unable to act upon their impulses. To put it simply, women are too gaslit by standards of misogyny to give into their more primal urges, while men are basically free to be whomever they want and whomever they want to be (unless it's womanly, again, thanks to misogyny.)
Which Software do you use for your Videos ?
2:15 guys its easy to stop a murderer, just feed them avocado and it'll all be good.
Amyone can kill anyone.
Make sure to take your omega 3 supplements mates
I don't see why not,if it weren't for the law,I would have hunted down all my former bullies and chopped their heads off their body into pieces
is ur hand ok?
Wat?
To be fair, that statement of only 14% if the female population are murderers could actually just be that only 14% of the female population has been caught. Either women aren’t murderers or women are just better murderers than men.
I can’t even kill a person properly in Fortnite
Women only commit 14.7% of murders? Maybe they’re just smarter about it 😂
HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Meh I wanna murder anyone who has done me wrong. I don't act on it because I believe everyone makes mistakes. Forgiveness is important and being able to move on.
Im really violent when i get mad like i rage i cant controll myself im like turning to hulk when im mad.
Is no one else alarmed by how much higher murder fantasies among average men vs low numbers among average women? 10 vs 3 is a lot
Only in defense, or like really bad people.
Women only commit 14% of murders because they are worse at it... just like suicides
When say that 1.33% of death are caused by murder, are victims of wars counted?!
NOO!
I’m not capable of murder. I would kill myself out of guilt.

as vengeance for the murder of a loved one, yes, definitely yes
Lethal violence increase "with evolution"?
No. There are no organisms on the earth that are "more evolved" than any other. We've all been evolving for 4 billion years or so, every lineage that's still around. Evolution has no endpoint or destination. Bacteria are just as highly evolved as primates.
The only reason I haven't kill a certain someone is that I get the wrong address at that time, few days later I finally got his address but I finally come to my sense and I decided to not risk it, I'm afraid of affecting the people around me as perfect crime is not easy to pull off 

If there is a day where I could kill him and get away with it, I will
Honestly, I've only ever had thoughts about the men who abused my mom and I. They are the only people I could actually watch be murdered and not feel remorse. When it comes to innocent people though, not so much. If I do, it's intrusive thoughts that I don't want.
yes I am
I find it so hard to even have the will to slice through the human body it gives me goosebumps and just scares me although I’m not sqwemish or sensitive to gore
=)
Any human being can
Ted Bundy joined the chat
Probably
Anyone is capable of murder.  Just depends on the circumstances.  Anyone who says they could never kill is lying or extremely un-self aware.  If someone came up to me and my dog and stomped it to death, I’d try to kill them (and it’s not self defense). Just an example. If someone stole my life savings I’d want to kill them.  Raped my daughter, same.
If I bought strawberry shortcake ice cream from ben and Jerries and it's gone before I have the chance to enjoy it best believe Ted will seem like my little brother.
Well I guess I’m a murder
murder could be a malfunction of the ego which increased with evolution rather than a goal of evolution
Yes, yes I am.
Run.
I don't think the question should be if we're capable, but rather, if we should.
Are You Capable of Mukduk?
Whole country full of killaz Ima killa too
Should have posted this on a sunday
The fact that I clicked on this video probably means I’m capable
There is only one person I want to murder 




My mother's cough boyfriend cough
Everybody is capable of murder.
Can the next video be "are you capable of suicide"
Committing murder is risky, and can have severe cost, such as... "not having access to your kids."
you heard it here first if you have a healthy heart youre a stalker and a murderer
Wait if people with low prefrontal cortex activity are more likely to be violent criminals... Does that mean people with executive function problems are more likely?
Humans are not primates.
Im not extremely aggressive in general, but i do have mental problems that can cause aggression and frequent mood swings, but according to this video, i’m fairly likely to commit murder, but i dont really want to go to jail, sorry
Why is this in my recommended?!
wow , men are emotional and controlled by their feelings , how can someone throw their whole life just to kill someone , be logical !
Am I the only one genuinely surprised by the amount of murderous thoughts people have? Like, WTF is wrong with you people?
So you explained some possible reasons why men murder more than women; what theories can you guys tell me for the relatively higher black murder rate?
Hopefully
Did that done that.
Before watching, I'll just say: yes
REDRUM! REDRUM! REDRUM!!!!
Uhhh...who's hand is on the left at 2:20?
my heart is only beating slow cause i haven’t moved from my bed since i got home from school 5 hours ago
It's time for church! Let's go kill some people!
If the Maos of China don't have the MAO gene...
When your resting heart rate is 58 😵🔫
Oh my god what is that graphic at 2:20 5 arms, two people?
El Chapo enters the chat
well lets find out shall we
I think most people are good people and would not commit murder. But medications can alter a person's mind and can cause good people to murder.
Ah no I  think I got the case of the homsidly
no.
But why are men way more likely to be victim of murder as well?
Oh my god
Dam I’ve been watching serial killer documentaries and shit a lot lately and than ASAPscience came out with this video
It’s also possible that woman are taught to be less aggressive and show more restraint than men growing up. Men being violent is seen as more normal and less frowned upon, so of course they’re more likely to go out and kill someone.
This channel got dark, like guys am I the only one thinking this? Is this guy ok?
Accidently killed a spider when I didn't see it in the sink.  I got was and washed it down the sink and said rip
"Increased with evolution" is junk. We aren't further evolved than other animals.
I be killin' noobs on phantom forces in roblox
My heart rate is lower than 60 bpm
Like in Grosse Pointe Blank 
When I left, I joined the army, and when I took the service exam my psych profile fit a certain... moral flexibility would be the only way to describe it... and I was loaned out to a CIA-sponsored program, and we sort of found each other. That's how it works.
Heartbeat? Wtf is that? 
I feel nothing. No pulse
Outside of videogames ive never had truly murderous thought

Beat the crap out of someone yes murder no

Guess I’m part of the 24% of women who don’t
I think a lot about killing people, I'm capable of doing it.
Murdering myself sure
Bed wetting and sexual repression growing up is also a sign of being a future serial killer. Oh and animal abuse
Everyone is capable of murder ok, bye!
Stay sexy, don't get murdered.
My heart rate didn’t go up... stay away from me y’all I’m heartless
FBI joined the chat
i’m vegan
U know what.. u shoud think about the netizen that "murder" with their comment.. i mean it seems creepy when u read some of comments
It's those who are least aware (or in denial) of their violent potential that are the more worrisome.
I cut a bee into two pieces (separated the thorax from the abdomen) and immediately felt super bad and squeamish and just icky. I can watch any graphic horror film because I cant deal with the blood shed and inhuman torture. I can barely bring myself to squash anything bigger than an ant. My empathy level is just to high, I can't kill anything.
Everyone is
yes
We can boil it down to facts and statistics as much as we want, but we’re all capable of murder.
You can’t link something with evolution, everything is equally evolved to its habitat, when you were linking « evolution » with murder rates in certain species did you mean to link murder rates to species with higher intelligence?
Everyone is capable of murder. 

It's just a matter of finding their breaking point.
I once murdered a female mosquito





current objective : survive
Well, now I need to worry. My heart rate stayed lower than usual throughout this entire video. My heart rate freaking dropped while watching this video. Well, I guess I know my future job! LOL.
finally i’ve been waiting for this 🤩🤩
I was asking my friend to tell me the story of how he came out he said ASAP science inspired him now I love this channel ❤️:Also is water wet?
Under the right circumstances I believe everyone for the most part is capable of murder.
“Is your heart beating fast? Then your probably fine”




I’m fine
Oh no I’m such a terrible person.
But idk why I don’t feel bad about it
An avocado a day keeps the killing away
Asap Science got dark
:( at 1:40 it's a left-handed helix instead of a right handed helix :( You're bringing me down asapSCIENCE!
Oh, I've TOTALLY got this "Warrior Gene"! I knew from little on up I was meant to be a fighter...thrust into the sappiest world in all human history! What a divine punishment.

(Ahem) Why murder? It is human nature's attempt to purge the weak and stupid from the gene pool, leaving only the most efficient (or desirable) traits left to reproduce...or, more primally, it is a response to anger - anger that is often caused by feeling wronged in some capacity. And yes, the legal punishments of this day and age make murder "not worth it"...which is exactly why there is such a thing as "law" in the first place.
Great so my mom saying she sees me becoming a murderer is likely
My heart rate is 147
0:38 my heart's not beating fast...
Aggression increases with evolution? That's scary
Hmm my heartbeat is rather low, and I'm a male..
So what does this teach us? Eat your fish, don't become a murderer
I’m not capable of pointless murder
If you killed yourself in the future is it scuicide or murder?🤔🤔🤔
Your thumbnails are so cool!
Well I've been to war, so I'd say yes.
14% of woman commit murder? 
maybe woman are better at it and don't get caught xD
I have an pretty low resting heart rate (lower than 50 bpm at times), but I don't have ""violent tenancies" or exhibit "stalker-ish behavior".
Am I capable of killing someone? Yes, maybe in self-defense, if I had no choice. Am I capable of murder? I don't think so.
There's a difference between the two.
My heart wasn't beating that fast but I'm just naturally calm so does that mean anything bad
"I once killed a man with this thumb"
am i capable? absolutely. but do i wish to? not really
great information! i’ll be sure to store this in my “for later” playlist. :)
Competing for females in nature is probably why this trait is so common in men. It's like any other animals in the animal kingdom. The right to mate with who you choose can very often come at a cost. A fight to the death. Women on the other hand are less likely to kill because of evolutionary biology. We would often forage in groups together, protecting one another from threats from wild animals and so on. I'd imagine with our new sense of moral agency currently we should eventually overcome this biological trait. Yet, It's still important to acknowledge reasons for different behaviours.
I wanna strangle you
lol jk
Too hard, much easier to pay someone else to do it
Correlation does not lead to causation.
Yes
When your life is at stake, humans' instinct goes back to its primitive nature and will do anything to protect themselves. People are capable of achieving anything if they really choose to. It's just matter of whether they want to or not. For example: Person A loves person B and person A won't ever break up with person B, but that doesn't mean person A can't break up with person B. Similar to murder, people can murder anyone anytime they want. But on a normal circumstance, if there's no particular reason, they choose not to act on those thoughts and have control over them. That's what separates humans and animals. Life is all about choices.
I have the berserker gene.
Why is this a video???
Yeah
No u
I get scared of thisXxxxx this is my phobia gettin killed
women makes murder possible
"Murder has inspired documentaries, games, and even podcasts"

fixed
offcourse, im a human, thats what we do
"even games"
Uh oh, I stalk my crushes




Not completely but I memorized on girls school schedule. I just linked the classes I have with her, the classes I’ve seen her enter, and classes she’s talked about and pieced it together
Making a murderer, An ASAP Science original
Everyone, under the right (or wrong) circumstances, is capable of murder. Killing is a survival mechanism.
what a nice non deep topic to talk about
There's some funky business happening with the arms at 2:19
3:56 "Lethal violence increased with evolution"... Primates are not more evolved than other animals! Evolution only means change. The fact that some animals seem more complex does not make them "more evolved".
If you use terms incorrectly, you just add up to misinformation!
Are you a gemini? Then yes. You capable of murder.
I feel like I should be worried since I thought some of this was funny...
I got 3 kills last night in fortnite
I have a dark passenger
I’m getting some major anti-men propaganda from this
Yup.
I would if it's Trump.
the amount of edge in this comment section sharper than a knife
My resting heart rate is 55 😱. Who wants to be the first victim?😏
i would murder all of the bullies in the word, but those who caused suicide of someone i would torture and then kill them
Murder rate is down because of gaming. I murder about 200 people daily just imagine if I would do it in real life
Unnoticed bias: the resting heart rate study was only among people who signed up for the military. (ie there is no control group)
When you kill, you, well, you get to be happy...
I never had any homocidal thoughts let alone it be vivid but i know im capable of murder given the circumstances if it forces me to do it
Get an urge to kill and then realize what it won't accomplish. Makes you feel sick.
0:30 

I'm the 9%? 

Anyone else see this as particularly off?
honestly, it would take too much work and time to murder and get away with it.
I had a dream where I shot a girl in the head with a pistol.
Blood dripping from head. It felt so real. xc
If you aren’t capable of murder - then you should be vegan 🌱
jokes on your, I have tachychardia
I murder in Fortnite
The way they tiptoed around the biological differences between men and women when it comes to the higher rates of murder for men is just plain stupid. Say it like it is, men are more likely to be aggressive and women are more likely to be caring. Doesn’t mean that everyone fits to these parameters but pretending that they don’t exist is just willful ignorance.
Yikes I matched with a lot of these. At least I know how dangerous I am though..................
That’s a lot of likes...
I’ve murdered around 13949 people






in csgo
I’m watching this on a Sunday, hold on, there is a man walking over to my house who has a knife!
To bad women kill more children then men.
I'm part of that 76%  of women that have murder fantasies
I'm part of that 76%  of women that have murder fantasies
Possibly?  I've had a friend, who I thought was more cold blooded than me, say that I sometimes scared her.  But I tend to severely overthink things and planning a perfect murder takes too much time and effort, especially when you have a list of ideals that would contradict the ideal murder.  The most feasible way is an unfortunate accident that can't be proved otherwise, or synthesis of a complex poison, but stabbing them with a knife seems so much more intimate and terrifying.  One cut to the proper arteries and you can watch them bleed out as they die.  But that leaves so much room for error and there's so much cleanup involved afterwards.  Of course, an ideal poison would be something that kills over time, rather than instantly, is virtually untraceable, manifests few common symptoms, if any, tasteless and odourless seem to be ideal, and work in conjunction with the person's lifestyle.  Like, if you know someone likes eating potatoes and is single, you can inject varying doses of belladonna toxins into their food.  If they're an adrenaline junkie and a foodie, entice them to Japan to try Fugu and sneak a very small amount of tetrodotoxin into their fish (works better if you have no desire to try the pufferfish).  Or if they are on immunosuppressants, give them the flu.  Killing strangers is pointless, so someone you despise would be a better target (nothing for me there).  Revenge kills are the most satisfying, especially if they take some time, but the more time taken, the easier it is to trace the incident.  Depending on the degree of familiarity, you also have to show up to the funeral.
Increase with evolution? Is that supposed to mean just over time (as in the example of medieval compared to now) or are you insinuating primates are "more evolved" than other animals because that's not how evolution works.
I cant think of 1 time I've fantasized about it.  I also save bugs from drowning and let paper wasps live on my front porch.  🤷‍♀️
Literally was reading a chapter for my Sociology course on this earlier woah
I am capable but it’s too much work and too much risk. I will only do it if anyone or myself are in a situation where it’s either kill them before they kill me
I feel like i could totally get away with murder but it takes a lot of planning and I'm way too lazy for that
Uuuum I'm a pacifist to the point that I believe the military should be abolished so I'm going to say no.
“Yes” •clicks on video•
33% unsolved? That should factor in the decision...
So I'm capable of murder?
shit my heart rate didnt go up
Yes, next
A video of “is everyone racist?” I believe that everyone has a little racism in them .... but maybe I’m wrong? Or is something else?
@AsapSCIENCE You should do a video on herpes. Considering 67% percent of all the world population has type 1 herpes. But no one knows they could have it because the virus stays dormant and doesn't show symptom for most.
Hell nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. I can't kill mosquito, let alone a Human being.
Yeah probably
I killed my pet fish..
I’ve never had a murder fantasy. Didn’t think I’d be in the minority on that one.
I’m really aggressive but I couldn’t murder anyone
Is killing mosqitoes counts?
I can’t even kill a fly
Yes, I’m actually willing to kill half the population 7.7 billion people is way to many people, kill the poor.
Just another day in Canada.
Rip to all of the people who actually froze to death 😔
what happens when you freeze to death?

A lot of work goes into making these videos, not only do you need to be highly knowledgeable in your field of expertise, but you also need to be an artist. :-)

Me after watching this video: Nvm
Bruh it’s -40 here in Canada

Well, basically...

So scary this happened to 15 in Chicago
My school is really stupid, one morning it was -18 degrees and they didn’t let us in for like 30 minutes. My hands where in my pockets and i was thinking “wtf I can’t feel my hands” and then I took them out and looked down and my hands where completely purple
Short answer- You die.
After reading the title 
Me: Well...you die
Somebody froze to death in my city. Temp with wind-chill was -74
Yesterday it was -44° in Illinois yesterday
Oh great, this came up into my recommended while I’m locked out of my house. R.I.P.
SCIENCE QUESTION! Does Drinking alcohol help you stay warm?
Now i know why Jack let go.
If you live in the Midwest right now you now what happens
Can you make a video talking about AP classes and their benefits / drawbacks? I’d love to hear what you have to say
In northern Minnesota we haven’t hit above freezing in 60 days😉
People die when they are killed
It was -50 degrees Ferinhight just a couple days ago in Wisconsin.
But you can actually come back to life if you are unfreezed..
-Shane dawnson conspiracy theories
This is giving me flashbacks to Jack London’s “To Build a Fire”
Good luck to everyone getting affected from this horrific weather. 
Stay safe 🙏
Bruh in 1869 in Nebraska it was -10 or -9 out there this year it was -14F
Really feeling this in the lovely midwestern -20° weather

You die.
By freezing.
Seems pretty self explanatory to me.
This made me cold just watching this.
2:20 You spelled "Environment" wrong xD
Great work once again! I'd love to see more climate science videos!!!
Welp
I wish the people in chacago luck
I'm in New zeland
This video made my blood run cold
Fitting video. It’s cold as heck today.
Cells at Work taught me to always protect my waifus and husbandos.
Hmm the normal body temperature ranges between 35 to 37.4ºC so at 37ºC you are totally fine. 






Oh yeah yeah
Survival tip: don’t wait for streetcars 💀😢
-45° in the midwest !!! we’ve been off school for a week and a half now
It's -30°C in Canada..😖😖.Why did I chose Canada for my study
Med student here. hypothermia is not just below 37 degrees. A motif people have a basal body temperature of 36,7  ans its totally normal
Hypothermia is when your body is below 35°
When it's 55 outside

I'm freezing to death lmao
"What Happens When You Freeze To Death?"
Basically, you get too cold, and then you die.
THIS WAS UPLOADED ON THE DAY BELOW ZERO CAME OUT
Chicago is -67 right now 🥶
Ask Winter Soldier, he is an expert by now.
Survival tip this winter:-
Take bath with clothes on.
You just had to include the Titanic as an example! THERE WAS ROOM FOR TWO ON THE DOOR, ROSE!
but...




how do we survive aging to death?
hey you got error at 0:19  37 degree Celsius core body temperature is mild fewer hypothermia occurs under  35.0 °C also -37 is way too low i guess typo ;)
You turn into the rapper Ice Cube.
I wish I could draw on a whiteboard like this
As an Iowan right now...I'm offended. 






Just kidding but it's -40 right now.
its -35°F here lmfaoooo
The cold never bothered me anyway. Oh wait, wrong year.
Meanwhile here in Australia it's just hitting 40 degrees Celsius...
I think you mean 37° instead of -37°😊
Dont go out with just a dress or shorts! Take a jacket with you! Wear gloves! Wear a scarf! This isnt about how you look its about making sure youll get home physically fine!


Ok thats it stay safe guys
Today in Chicago, enjoy getting your eyes turned into snowballs
somebody tell this to schools in New York so we can have more snow days
What about death from overheating?
It was 50 degrees Celsius here in Australia last week
In short:
Watching this on the coldest day in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (Canada) since 1907 with it being -37C without the wind chill and -52C with it this morning. Being outside hurts 😫
It's literally so cold in NYC. It's 3 degrees rn.
Is it me or do I get a weird feeling of satisfaction when watching this video when I’m cozy. (>.<)
Winnipeg this week has been colder than some parts of Mars sitting at -40°C with wind chill of -55°C.
Who lives in Michigan and the feel like temperature is -35°F and the actual temperature is -13°F
If you want to survive winter as homless, just go to prison for some months;)
You said 11 weeks, but the text on the screen says 11 hours (3:33)

when the temperature is below -20c then I change from shorts to pants.
Burn or freeze...I still sneeze.
ppl in the midwest need to take notes
When you freeze to death you will reincarnate as frozone
You die when you freeze to death.
Boom, saved you 4 minutes and 8 seconds of video.
What ever happened to Global Waming?

Omg your corneas can freeze?! I did not know this!!
Waif wtf
Did you just actually end the video with we have brought someone back from the dead.
answer to question:

you die
Damn, I should have watched this before walking outside in shorts and a t-shirt in Cleveland.
Norwegians would like to know your location
So like I'm about to take my EMT exam was wondering could you make a video highlighting major parts to help me study 😂 I learn better in your videos than reading
Greetings, it's currently -45° without wind chill, please send help
I would freeze to death but the thing is that ...........
great timing to post this on the day Chicago is colder than Antarctica...
Well that made me quiver! 😂
Who esle watching this was cold?
My body temperature is never 98.6.
It’s always 98.3 or 98.4 for some reason
This literally just happened in a university in Iowa. Gerald Belz, 18

R.I.P. to all the victims.
Turn heater up 4 degrees after watched this video, just in case
Do more songs please!
Saying "being exposed to the cold - within 30 minutes..." is not scientific at all, what temperature is it? If it's - 50C you'll likely be dead within those 30 mins.
2:14 how qUiKlLy your core body temperature
welcome to Canada!
Dying is the number one cause of death in the UK
It might take a little longer but I rather frezz to death rather than burn
It really is a matter of ”when”, when living in Finland.

It’s like 40 degrees in Australia lol
Anyone here from Australia 🇦🇺 and not the Canada or just me????
I can't freeze to death because I spend all my time browsing dank memes.
It's currently -37° in Minnesota 😂😭
My guess: you die

Edit: I was right
That background music really makes me feel uncomfortable ☹️
AsapSCIENCE: “What happens when you freeze to death?”

The Night King is typing...
in the tn it said 35 C, But in the video it says Hypothermia comes from 37 C.
Hypothermia happens when your body temperature drops below 35 C not 37 C
Someone from our community froze to death a couple of days ago due to the -50 weather. This is so sad. May he rest in peace. 😭😭😭
He said 11 weeks, but drew 11 hours. Did anyone else notice? 3:33

I'd rather freeze than burn to death
Lets sum this whole video here:
What happens you Freeze To Death ?
You die,  I saved you 5 minutes
4:03 is that a Day After Tomorrow reference because I love that movie
What happens when you freeze to death? Well you die.

The question should be, what happens WHILE you freeze to death?
Those Germans in Stalingrad went thru some rough $¶%t 😯

This was a really interesting video, thank you!
You said 11 week recovery but had 11 hours on screen
Just another day in canada
-61 in Minnesota and I walked out in shorts
Damm -31 is like one of the warmest time right now in canada😂
Haha... This is helpful... looks outside at -51 weather Too real. It's all too real.
Love Your Videos ASAPSCIENCE.
Greetings from Finland! -35 everyday for a week now. Happens every winter tho haha~
My temperature is 36 degrees. Do I have hypothermia?
My great grandmother froze to death.
She was in her 90s and her nursing home let her wander outside and she fell into a retention Pond and she couldn't get out.

The coroner wanted us to understand that she did not drown, she froze to death , in 50 degree weather.
The government puts stuff in vaccines to make you get cold vaster! How could you not mention this! #readabook
In Minnesota its gotten as cold as -65, yeah I might as well just surrender now
"What happens when you freeze to death?"

You die. Just saved you 4 minutes.
I live in Canada so let me summarize & I don’t need to watch the full vid to know. Your fingers and toes give out first, your nose starts to run & that means your lungs are wet too, your snot/phlegm freezes and crystallizes, every breath scrapes your lungs until you bleed and drown in your own blood and that will freeze too.

Edit: it was -45 Celsius here Yesterday.
“What Happens When You Freeze to Death”

Steps—
-you die
If anyone can give you tips about freezing it would be a Canadian ♥
One of the best videos I've seen on YouTube. After working out in -20 to -30 °F with high wind, the first thing I said when I got back inside was "my eyeballs feel like they're freezing". Now I know why!.  Thanks
What's with the creepy background music man? How am I gonna sleep Tonight??
What happens when you freeze ro dead?
Yesterday was -30F and after I walked to class I couldn’t feel my toes for thirty minutes
If U have cold just drink 2 cups syrup grape
Idk why I said you live.
Please keep those in mind who are homeless where the Polar Vortex is hitting them.. also help them if you can😭
Says 11 weeks but writes 11 hours
Show this to my school so they stop leaving us outside in 10°
When i first found this channel,I thought it's a rapper
At 4:09 you said: "11 weeks" but on the illustration it says 11 hours.
Pray for the homeless in Chicago
Today in LA it poured rain!! The thunder and lightening was pretty crazy, too!! Climate change can be so confusing..
if you live in the north eastern part of the us (more specifically new york state) this video is what they should show in schools lmao
turned it off right after he mentioned ancestors having more hair 🙄🙄
1:56 
why does that girl looks like me. hahahahaha
-40° F in Minnesota, 4 cancelled school days :)
It’s -62 for me I have to wear 7 pears of socks to keep my feet warm in my house it’s that cold
My body temperatur is 36°c
Now a video on, what happens when you're exposed to extreme heat in deserts likewise... I've heard many die 🙄
thank you for explaining our fate to us midwestern americans
Hi everyone . . .




I hope you have a nice day 
I ask nothing of you
Warm wishes to everyone
100% would rather die of heat exhaustion than in extreme cold temperatures.
0:00 Now thats where you wrong kiddo
my hands are always cold
3:35
Narration says 11 weeks, visuals show 11 hours
2:14 “environment” was spelt wrong. Just saying.
3:34
11 Hour Recovery on screen. The narrator says “11 weeks.” Just letting ya know.
Actually 35-36 celsius is the norm for body tempeture.
Good timing with the polar vortex going right now, I see you’ve been waiting to drop this one 👍
I live in Canada and holy shit it’s cold
I never knew my body was that smart.
That background music
Wait so if no one is dead until warm and dead, doesthat mean jack could have still been alive 🤔
Short answer: You die
Haha YouTube you trying to be funny it's -12 degrees in. Chicago now and you recommended this to me
"nothing is dead until it's warm and dead" 
me : so [insert gif] if a penguin 🐧 dies...
Brought to you by Chicago's polar vortex
Chicago is colder than anywhere in the world. Holy cow
A beloved homeless man in my town froze to death 3 days ago from the cold. Hearing about how he physically died breaks my heart even more
Wow Asap really?

Edit: greetings from Chicago, Currently at -18
How did cap survive then?
I think you die
Well, this was a heartwarming video.
Come to Canada to find out.
you become with the ice and snow.
-50° windchills in Chicago brought me here
It was minus 39 this morning. With the windchill
I thought normal body temperature was 37°C... and hypothermia occurred under 35°C. 0:19
I got a 5 minute ad for this 4 minute video....
I love how you post this as I got frostbite in canada
Hypothermia kicks on when your body temperature drops below 34°C normal body temperature can range between 36.0°C to 37.9°C, not normally one to point out mistakes but this bugged me.
This video is hard to watch 😭
You forgot to say minus before you said thirty seven.
Midwest people be like

Its negative 40 where i am...
1:56 that explains why my eyes feel so dry and starts spazzing when it cold and windy
Yeah right 





Tell that to apetor
unless you're Vim Hof, then the cold just gives up
Just like Minnesota
Dying of hypothermia is more peaceful than dying from hyperthermia
@-ing Chicago so hard
Skin damage and a slow death?
Eating can keep you warm as well
For those who use Freedom units, 37 degrees Celsius is 98 degrees Fahrenheit.
Polar vortex gang where you at?
god thank ww2 for these facts
What is healthier?
Purple grapes, black grapes, or green grapes?
Red apples, dark red apples, or green apples?
(Edit) Another question: What's healthier? Mouldy fruit, or fresh fruit?
(I know some people might say this is a stupid question but life is mysterious and ya never know... HMMMMMMMMMMMM...)
MY FELLOW FINNS WHERE U AT??
Simple : I still have to do pe in the snow
i was born at 2:37 AM
Hypothermia does NOT occur at under 37c, it happens at 35c and below, while above 38 is considered to be a fever. A temperature of 36-37.5 is very normal. My temp rarely gets to 37 unless I'm sick and there is no way that I could have hypothermia after going to the gym on a hot day here in Australia...
Today it is -55c in Manitoba Canada
Y'all not gonna talk about Captain America?
I always wondered if it were to be better to die in extreme cold or extreme heat 🤔
rip Chicago evil laugh
In room the Caribbean no such weather
A guy at my college (University of Iowa) was found dead outside this week because it was so cold. So sad
While everyone is freezing, I’m in California. Stay warm! :(
What happens when you frezze to death? Simple







You're dead
NOW THATS ALOT OF DAMAGE
Thx needed to know so the polar vortex hitting me right now doesn't kill me.
Thats alot of damage!
people from Chicago and Wisconsin taking notes
You die





Didn’t watch the video just came to say that
-30 in Minnesota but it’s okay
People in the Midwest want to know your location
Could you explain how it is possible for a single cell to evolve to where we are now 
All so what are the chances of the universe creating life from nothing
Last off why is it Evolution takes millions of years when the sun is getting hotter would it not of been too cold for plants to grow if the world was millions of years old cheers👍 by the way this is not hate I in joy you videos a lot
They turn to rasions. Boys will know
Um Australian here
Short answer: you die
2:13 "Enviornment"
Objective rn in Chicago 

Survive
I was just wondering about this this morning
I gave this video a dislike because he gave the temperature in Celsius. I dont speak British you should ghive Fahrenheit
Its -60 with wind chill where I live in MN
Small eyes and small nostrils of English Europeans was essential for the winters.
Thats a lot of DAMAGE
what about the people who have gone in the  of hibernation in cold?
He posts as it’s -63 in Illinois
37 celsius?? If so i constantly have hypothermia..  my body temp is usually 36.3-.5
this video is uk pe lessons in a nutshell
This video low key scared me
this how michigan be feeling rn👍
3:34 11 hours or weeks? You say one, but draw the other.
when it’s cold







I pretend I’m todoroki (BNHA)
I wear shorts and a short sleeve shirt (I love being cold, if it’s -20 degrees out boy I’m going out there with summer clothing on)
I watch anime
"What would happen if there was no afterlife"
Me before video starts: if you freeze to death you die thats what happens
11 hour or 11 week recovery? 🤨
watching this in 2 degrees fahrenheit 👍
I live in Illinois and we just faced wind chills in the -40s
P O L A R V O R T E X
Maryland: we 6°F out here.
It's not even that cold tbh (for Michigan).
Im Australian so I cant relate...
And now I'm freezing in a 20°C air-conditioned room.
I know what happens 








You die
watching this in Iceland 🇮🇸
just another january day in update new york
Yo you were on the news yesterday on lithuanias tv station
I thought the title meant, what happens after you die while frozen? lol
I've experienced delirium first hand. It's not scary. You just feel hot and want to be cooled off. So taking a nap in the snow starts to sound like an amazing idea
* witty comment *
Short answer: you would die
They never have to worry about a thumbnail
The second I heard ancestors having fur I knew this isn't the channel for me.
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
Chicken strips!!!
This video made me Warmer
I wanna freeze to death so i can become Captain America 😂
Came here because I was wondering about the titanic victims and they answer it for me :)
More reason for humans to go full cyborg. Worst case scenario in exterme cold for robot would be increased mental capacity.
It was -21 where my grandparents live (Kenosha, Wisconsin) yesterday and YouTube recommended me this.
Lmao I’m in Chicago right now -55 so this was fun to watch 😂
People in Canada right now be like:
*chicago wants your location
the funny thing is it's snowing a lot outside
I put on a jacket when I start to freeze to death
Well that was terrifying
Tell me how a couple days ago in new york we were at -20 degrees and now we at 60 degrees







How
2:37 "Really Rose?" XDXDXDXD
Great thumbnail art!
So glad I live in the tropics....
Im in Illinois help
Just gonna test it in Wisconsin to make sure
Midwest here. Damn it's cold. But hey, day off. :)
I'm going camping in the snow tomorrow... Wish me luck!
-69 degrees over here...




Nice.
There is a huge belief in our part of world that Burning of Ghee ( Clarified Butter ) releases Oxygen. Is it true? Does burnig  of Oil release Oxygen?
People here are burning 60,000ltr of Ghee to rebuilt Ozone. 1ltr is roughtly 10$. They are collecting money to save the planet.
Please put light on this topic.
What happens when you freeze to death




Well duh, you freeze to death
this gave me so much anxiety.
we can all agree that this is a pretty cool video
Dam nature you scary
2:17 enviornment...
If it get so cold out there in your country, come here in the Philippines, we are happy to welcome you!
why did u choose this video when it is -40 in Ottawa
Be very careful when caring for a person with hypothermia! A sudden rise in temperature for a hypothermia patient can be dangerous and cause shock and fatal irregular heartbeats.
Wait what? Hypothermia says is below 37C(just divide with more), it is displayed '-37C' and not '<37'. Hypotherima means "below the (normal) temperature" and the normal human body temperature is 36,6C. Counting in Celsius make tenths kind of important cause in 36,6 you are ok and on 40-41 you should go to the hospital. Calculate with more accuracy.
Lol I saw this just as I saw Larry Wheels Vid
I'm in Guyana, almost like the safest country In the world!
No snow, no natural disasters!
I'm safe:)
As a new resident of upstate New York, I've experienced almost everything in this video lmao
in minnesota we have -60 windchill right now
Explain the iceman please
this channel doesnt know anything lmao
so can you kill a large seal and live inside of it to keep warm?
I think freezing to death is one of the worst ways to go.
Uploaded when there is snow storm in NY.
Makes this after the shane Dawson's conspiracy theory
enviornment??  oops
Stalingrad in a nutshell
Environment was mispelled.
You should make a video about essential oil vapes
I don't know Celcius GUY I'll never know when in going to freeze to death thanks
Is it a coincidence that this was released around Subnautica: Below Zero?
How can anything under 37 C be considered hypothermia when 36 - 37 C is the average normal body temperature of an adult? I think you meant to say "< 36 C"
The flat earth conspiracy theories
this video gave me the chills...
People are not creatures of extreme temps. Hot or cold. I use to do deliveries as part of my job. I remember going to a heat treatment plant. It was 92° outside. In there I guess 140° from the furnaces. When leaving the 92° felt like airconditioning. Then when getting back to the shop I worked out, my coworkers complaining of the heat! 🔥🌋😠
why is everybody talking about Chicago Minneapolis is way colder
Ayyyy he sayin my name lmaooo genesis
Meanwhile in Russia
People are having a bath in freezing water
Only watching because of the US polar vortex 😂
It was -24 yesterday in Chicago school was cancel for the whole week
Damn our body really does THAT
I know 2 better ways not to freeze to death. 
1) Be dead already
2) Don’t go outside and watch youtube all day
Why do i even watch this video,malaysia dont have cold season. Here its 37c in the day and 22c at the night.
Short answer: you freeze to death
You freeze to death




The end
I fell in the snow it got in my boots and gloves and its liek -25 degrees celsius man toronto is hard
I liked the new music in this video lol.
Jack Nicholson. RIP
I always heard that freezing to death is a pleasant way to die because you actually feel warmer and drowsier as death sets in. You kind of hinted at this when you mentioned about delirium setting in which causes people to remove their clothes before freezing to death.
Great video for the US right now
Science has shown that freeIng to death is the most peaceful way to die, by the way.
One thing for sure - you should not get drunk when it's cold. Alcohol may make you feel warm, but it's because it's increases blood flow in the skin (among other things), making you lose more heat in the process.
What happens when you freeze to death? 
Fighting Lucas in Ultimate
You Know You Are Done When You Have A COLD FEVER And YouTube Recommends You This...
-30 degrees here in Minnesota lul
I finally figured out why my hands don’t get cold in -5 F/-20 C weather. Thanks brown fat.
Hey ASAP Science! Please do a video on cringing! What is it and why when we see embarrassing or awkward things happening do we find ourselves in extreme awkwardness, physically convulsing and creasing, what is that??? There are cringe compilation videos on YouTube that I simply can't sit through its too hard, but I can watch surgery and it's fine! 😂🤷‍♂️
For those saying Canada is so cold, I live in Toronto where it’s currently -17 Celsius, and Chicago is -28 Celsius
Writer here, anyone else?
How about dying in extreme heat?
I want to freeze to death
Well that -60 front in america def killed some homeless... Perfect timing asap
fortnite ice storm has joined the chat
EVOLUTION IS NOT REAL I AM NOT A FISH LIKE IF U AGREE
So you said it took him 11 weeks to recover however the video said it only took 11 hours, typo?
Just in time for the polar vortex
3:33 week or hour????
Typo @ 2:15 “Enviornment” lol
Well I guess I always have hypothermia because my average body temperature is about 97 degrees Fahrenheit
idk bout you guys but id prefer this over dying to fire.. 🤔
enemy was frozen
2:14 Spelt environment wrong Mr science man
Misspelled environment.
Just had this happen to a fellow classmate... rest in peace
15 homeless ppl froze to death in Chicago. Everyone take a moment to realize how truly lucky you are.
Human: is freezing to death
Human: strips naked to ‘cool down’
What happens when you freeze to death? Eh, you die?
I'm no scientist, but...
says 11 weeks writes 11 hours and why in my comment under this was it crossed out
CoLorAdo wAnts tO kNow yOur locaTiOn
Normal body temperature is around 36.5-37 degrees Celcius so I am pretty sure that you meant that hypothermia occurs when the body temp goes below 35, not 37!
couldnt u just start running/moving alot in order to raise body temperature?
Just another reason why I wish todoroki was real
human body is amazing.
I’m Chicago right now slowly freezing to death
"No one is dead until warm dead"..? What is that mean..?
*11 week recovery
I think they get naked because they want to die because of all the pain
Meanwhile I'm complaining about it being 65 degrees in Hawaii...
I could've just watched the age of adeline
Thanks now I can survive in the shower
It was below 50° today in Chicago.
Haha that's funny when you live in Canada you become Elsa😂🤣
Good thing I live in south Texas, I’ve only seen snow twice in my life lmao
Do a vid of the science of hick-ups
The coldest trmpertite in my area ever recorded is allways 18 below zeor
3:34 11 hour recovery vs 11 week recovery
This video is for Floridians when the weather drops below forty-five degrees.
I think u guys had a brain freeze when u thought to publish on a Wednesday
Lots of homeless experiencing this right now. God damn reverse global warming!
So basically...
What happens when you freeze to death??  You die. ☠️
Meanwhile in the Southern Hemisphere we’re suffering in blazing hot 40 degree summers 🥵
🌴Los Angeles🌴
"Suicide by freezing"
At 3:36 is it 11 weeks or 11 hours?
Chicago rn
I am from Michigan. I've had minor frostbite. When yor skin feels numb at first and it turns very White. Then it feels like there's no blood getting to the part of your body th at has frostbite. Then, your affected skin starts to feel extremely hot.
You usually get frostbite in your hands, feet, ears and face first. Then it will spread to the rest of your body. 
If frostbite gets severe enough, or you don't warm up soon enough, your cells in the affected area could die and have to be amputated!
If you don't warm your body up as soon as possible after getting frostbite, it can lead to more severe frostbite and become a medical emergency! Or, worse yet, it can lead to hypothermia. That is much worse! Hypothermia is automatically a life threatening, medical emergency! You have no choice but to get to the hospital emergency room as soon as possible or you could die!!!
Haha I just got a snow weather warning (expecting about a feet+ of snow) haha
Its -30 °F where I live atm
‘Humans don’t have fur’ 
Me-‘my dog does’
"Hypothermia occurs when the core body temperature drops below 37°C." But normal body temperature is 36.5°C so either im missing something or these guys have no idea what theyre talking about.
And they say global warming is real
When will they get us a patch for this?🙄come on evolution
As a Swede who has been exposed to cold temperatures I can confirm the part about feeling hot when it's cold. You feel colder and colder until on point when you realize that the only thing you are feeling is pain, and it's the same pain you feel when something burns.
Can you guys do the opposite too? In Australia, a far more pressing issue is ridiculous heatwaves, not subzero temperatures
Welcome to Detroit city..
dat voice crack tho 2:15
35 C not 37 C! 37 is literally the normal average body temperature so please do not think if you're body temp is below 37 you're hypothermic. @AsapScience
Like many of our ancestors😄😆😆😆
-50 in Chicago!!!! Yay! 🥶🥶
Well. I am canadian. But this gives me no advantage, I also have cold urticaria (read, allergic to cold). I was born in the wrong country.
Can you do a "The body reacting to only fruit"???
Will Smith- Freezing my a** off
Lmao just dont get cold
He says 11 weeks and the video shows 11 hours. I don't know what to believe anymore.
You didn't mention the peeing ...
Am I high or does his voice sound robot like?
I think you might die. Just a hunch though.
it was -55 w windchill two days ago here in minnesota
Gosh I love ALERT
What's worse freezing to death or burning to death????? What is more painful?? 😐
That's pretty chill
Jack Dawson has joined the chat
So Canada isn't there only place like this in?
Well it is right now -21 Degrees so bye disgusting world
@AsapSCIENCE you guys should do a video about your brain on dabs or oil. Since you have done weed and edibles.
This is literally a documentary on the people living in mid west America rn
Good thing I dont normally go outside during this chill.
Insert a popsicle stick and they're good to go
Oh jeez I’m early for once!
It’s -38 degrees where I live. Canada
Hypothermia does not occur when your core body temperature is less than 37 degrees Celsius. I might buy less than 36, but it’s more like less than 35 degrees Celsius. Also, he pronounced “vasoconstriction” wrong.
3:35 there should be written 11 weeks, not hours ;)
You know what happens when u freeze to death 



You Die
Step one: move out of canada.
Lol. We have this huge freeze rn in PA, we even have to stay home from school, so this is rather ironic.
It was -50 with wind chill in Chicago yesterday and every single place was closed. U couldn’t even breath outside.
During the usa midwest cold how many people here had school or know someone who had to go to school during the cold weather?
Note to self don’t go outside 
(I live in Chicago btw)
Yeah, but can freezing to death kill me?
You guys are Canadian, so I know why you decided to upload this topic now..
It's -30°c in Alberta but some girls still wear dresses and skirts... I wear a full winter gear and I'm still cold. Sometime I wonder if they're polar bears...
Not a fan of this new music
If you’ve got time, watch Extreme Everest with Ant Middleton on Channel 4 (UK). A very good watch which also showcases the dangers of extreme weather🥶
Can u make a video on 'what if the whole world ate only meat/vegetables and fruits.' or ' What effect do mobile phones actually have on us?'
Nothing from this happens when you drink vodka :v
Everyone talks about Chicago and Canada but they ain’t got nothing on New York
Idk you probably get real cold then die
I hate the cold. Anything under 60 is a no no for me. 🤪
Just watched this video bc I'm in the snow waiting for my friends
I live in Australia why am I watching this
So this is how the people in the titanic died.... Rip Jack😔
Meanwhile in Russia.....
I think you just like... Die

Trump needs to do something about this cold weather! Seriously goddamn

Don’t, and I meant don’t, watch this high
Have you heard of Wim Hof? The guy who is called the Iceman- he was really ok staying in ice-cold water for about two hours ;)
What happens when you don’t freeze to death?





IDK
3:38 wait 11 HOUR recovery? Or 11 WEEK recovery...?
We actually have evolved to cold weather, with our intelligence in making furs and clothes
This is so cool I never knew the science behind frostbite and hypothermia
I like this channel. I'm glad you have so many subscribers now.
*environment :)
3:35 it says 11 hrs but you guys said 11 weeks
I feel like I learn actual important information from this than actually going to school.
The reason why People who are freezing to death discard their clothing is because of natural sweat making their clothing colder, not mental. Yes Humans do sweat in extreme cold during physical activity actively trying to reach shelter.  The natural sweat freezes clothing faster, thus removing it in a last desperate chance to survive.
cali's weather brought me here
A lil too soon
-25 today in Michigan
Chicago People comment here
Who in Chicago
Funny how global warming is actually causing these insanely low temperatures, I guess that's why they prefer to call it climate change now. It was colder in parts of the US than it is on the surface of Mars.
Title answered in one sentence... you die.
Watching in a blanket
Y O U  D I E
I've had my eyes freeze before. It kind of sucks. It's very uncomfortable.
I’m high af eating a salad and this video lowkey scared me
Short answer u die
I really love cold weather leggings, hot coffee, Cuddling with bae while watching Netflix 😘 best feeling ever 🙂😀
YOU DIE. saved you 4 minutes
Posting on the same week as Shane Dawson was a big mistake
shi man our body is the real og
Everybody in the north and north east right now
Topical and relevant
Wow
What a nerd
I’m personally offended by the lack of Fahrenheit used in this video
I'll never need this I live in California lmao
This is so intense when you’re high 😹
what happens when this channel makes good content? no one knows.
People in New York right now be like Word to my Timbs.
It’s actually not that cold to be honest haha
That's why being set on fire would be much better
At 3:35 3:37he said 11 weeks and it showed up as 11 hours
Anyone else just watch a video on the donner party? Or just me
DEAD... The End
I’ll keep this in mind for when I freeze to death the next time
Whats the name of tune playing in the video ?
What is the music in the beginning
Quick answer:I will die
Question- What if our population were to double over night. What happen to the planet. Also what pros and cons would happen due to the sudden change. Would people over populate the planet or could we think of a way to save both the people and the planet. From things such as pollution and or maybe an increase in violence?
Why do I live in Canada again  ?
3:34 you said that it's eleven weeks but in the video it's eleven hours
At 3:35 , You said 11 weeks but wrote 11 hours in the video..
I’m stationed in Minot ND it’s a consistent -10+ here in the winter not including wind chill
My hands are always cold even when the rest of my body is normal or warm... why is that?
Could you translate the temperatures to Fahrenheit for the 300 million plus smericans
3:35 
11 weeks or 11 hours recovery? 🤔
HypeBeasts beware.
Next one: what happens if you overheat
So why not just Freeze cancer cells and killed
2:10
QuIcKlY
Probably should have posted this a couple days before the polar vortex...
You should study for you tests thank me later
3:34 11 weeks, not hours :)
Frostbite 😉
Its -30 C and very windy so its very fun when you blink and ice falls from your eyes
Why do people always get so competitive over who lives in the hotter or colder climate?
Tell this to people in Pennsylvania and Chicago ._.
How it is at my friend’s house
one ime me and my friends was locked out in our t-shirts for like 30 minutes and it started to get kinda hot
0:25 you said less than 37 degrees Celsius but you put -37 degrees put a > or < on it
The more simple answer is that you die
Oh yeah yeah
this was rlly helpful!! i live in chicago and we just went through five blizzards in a row and a record breaking cold yesterday!!! i'm sending this to everyone i know in this area so we can be more aware about the cold!
I know what happens when you freeze to death....



You freeze to death.
Wow you also spelled temperatare wrong at 2:16.
At 2:18 environment is spelt incorrectly.  I don't mean to be a pedant but this is one of those "knowledge is cool" channels.
California wants to stay away from you pesky canadians
Well this doesn't seem so bad. Maybe I'll try to kill myself by hypothermia next time!
My ancestors didn't have fur.
New Yorkers right now
the midwest and canada have entered the chat
Tf is -37° C?
2:19 Enviornment lmaoooo
I feel they made this cause of Chicago
ask the everest zombies
So leo could have been saved?
Please do body on DMT
You die. Thanks for watching. Be sure to leave a like down below.
Well...
The lowest the temperature has been in Scotland in the last few days was -9C but feels like about 4-5 degrees below that temperature and even colder with a wind chill.  I honestly, feel no different than the time Scotland had temperatures of -25C.  I doubt it will get any colder here but stepping out there feels like stepping into a freezing freezer.  xx
“enviornment”
This seems like a nice way to die
Hypothermia does not occur when your body temp drops below 37c. That's 98.6f which is optimal body temp. My temp varies between 97 to 99f. Hypothermia happens when your temp drops below 35c or 95f. Check your research friends.
Canada in a nutshell
3:37 you wrote hours instead of weeks :))
Interesting...goes good with the weather
My guess from the title is that you die...
2:15 nice voice crack mate
What about acclimation? Why are some bodies better-suited for cold?
Enviornment
You die, you're welcome saved your time
Who’s in California uneffeced rn lol
Enviornment
Rest In Peace to the homeless who went through this, so sad
If rose had put the life vest under the door they both could’ve lived.
Well...in short you die
2:14 - Environment is spelt wrong...
What about cryosleep
Oh another video on death.
how are you out here thumbing down science 😒
No mention to whim hof?
News on the Polar vortex brought Me here...
11 week recovery*
wait, so is it 11 hours or 11 weeks?
If you want to be more accurate its not Delerium....its Paradoxical Undressing..when your brain thinks you're really hot when you're not...yes it's a form of Delerium but it's actual term is Paradoxical Undressing
Freezing to death sounds so much mors terrible than burning to death.
It’s called hypothermia
In my opinion I like this guy more than the other his voice is more soothing
Please do heat stroke
I live in Europe, I used to live in America, am I gud?
Yea. FCK The Cold!! I’m good with it being too hot outside.
0:55 thats my name :)
What is we only are salt for 1 month plz tell me

What about wim

how to survive extreme cold pro tip - don’t live in england because you’ll die it’s always cold
Like your ancestors not mine
Humans don’t have fur like many of our ancestors? You know that darwin himself doesn’t even believe in his own theory right?
3:39 you said weeks it said hours which one was it?
Just a day in Winnipeg
how about ICEMAN?!
I've gotten frostbite every year since 2011. My eyes froze shut in 2014 and, coincidentally, I became short sighted that year. Canada ftw.
3:05 I thought that was an almond.
And people  freeze  them self to be remelted and alive after 40 years or more😑 im confused
Imagine watching while high.
The part about delirium sounds like material for a thrilling novel. Wicked stuff. Hard to believe it's real.
The  Wim Hof method...
Your body gets cold
2:19 enviornment
Can humans go into torpor? I feel like I’ve done so before...
Oh man sounds awful
11 weeks or 11 hours? (:
0:00 hey humans do have fur... If you’re a furry like me
11 hours lol
11 hours*
You get hypothermia
I legit almost froze to death yesterday, it was the scariest experience of my life. My entire body was numb, I was losing coordination and was forgetting where I was going and my phone was dead from the cold so I couldn’t call for help. Luckily a security guard in a near by building let me inside to warm up. I’m forever grateful 😭❤️
I want to go to a detention with out people that sound like this
I got cold watching this
Hold your breath till you pass out so you won't feel anything
Love you videos! I think this is the first time I found a error. You wrote 11 hour recovery yet said 11 week recovery. Which is it?
2:14 #minivoicecrack l0l
Looks like I’m not gonna freeze to death anytime soon but still some useful info
ENVIORNMENT.
What is a Celsius
Not gonna watch the video but..........you die
Short answer is that you die.
Anyone else freezing rn?
Can you please do one on why they set fire to the train tracks when its negative temperatures
The muscles look like almonds
Idk. You die?
The human body is so cool this is interesting
you get cold, duh
This tought me sooooo muchhhhhhh I spent hours in 6 degree weather and I felt hot af when I felt the heat in the car I felt like I was burning and then I looked at my phone and it looked foggy af the an hour passed and I was good

Chicago take notes!
I don't want to watch this, but i know if u freeze to death, then u r dead man
Toronto atm
Wim Hof Method can save your life!
@ Chicago
This is so sad
Your cells explode
You turn into an ice cube
This music in the start, seems very familiar
Well I die
You dead lol.
When it’s cold outside so you boot up your DS and play in front of the fire place
wow Tired.
This is especially morbid given the recent deaths in Canada and the USA
I’m on the eastern shore of Maryland and it is 14 degrees Fahrenheit right now..
i live in wi and i only had school on tuesday so far and have to go again tomorrow
What about Wim Hof????
I would imagine freezing to death to be cold
0:18 When I was a kid I used to check my body temperature every day and it's always under 36°c tho ._.
This video should be called - what happens when you wait for the public transportation in winter
Winning has joined the chat
I think you die.
Man's not cold
You Die? 4Head
My toes almost froze to death driving to the dentist Thursday morning at -20 degrees Fahrenheit lol
Ummm.... You freeze?
@3:15 Sooo you mean that reverse-cryogenesis has already been done under our noses and everyone was silent about it until now?
Chicago going sicko mode
11 hour recovery or 11 weeks?
Someone I kno got his toes amputated yesterday
mpemba effect??
Haha chicago
Yeah. Really, Rose?
@edmonton
Ah that’s nice

Watching this in a tropical country
Environment.
0:18 It's below 35 celsius not 37. If you go a little above 37 you already have a fever.
You should make a video on what happens when you overheat yourself to death
Just use the Wim Hof method!
I don’t care what happens as long as I don’t have to deal with this pain in my heart anymore.
2:20 “Enviornment”
@ 3:35 is it 11 weeks or 11 hours?
was his recovery 11 hours or 11 weeks? what you said and what you wrote were different.
it was negative 60 degrees
Why does the body get the credit of doing this why not us
3:36, 11 weeks or 11 hours ?
Oh my god
You stop living
At 3:36 you wrote 11 hour but said 11 weeks??
captain America
I would still rather freeze to death than die of heat.
Good thing I live in cancerfornia
Poor siberians
They should make a video like this but for burning to death if they haven’t already! It’s summer for me and gets to 40 degrees Celsius (I’m australian)
YOU COULD HAVE BOTH FIT ON THAT DOOR BOARD, ROSE.
We don't have brown  adipose tissues which are specific to animals that go through hybernation . We only have adipose tissue.
What would happen if you only ate corn?
2:14 his voice XD
Popsicle stick
2:13 nice little voice break
Funny that I had this video suggested. In São Paulo. Brazil. At 38°C
Uhmmm.. You die??
@ the Midwest right now
My brother got frostbite at camp because somebody stole his sleeping bag nobody even checked the tent, it was so cold that in the morning the water they left outside turned into ice
Wim Hof disagrees
Great timing......
What if you thaw the person that froze to death? Would they come back
What Happens When You Sneeze To Death?
So it's really cold and then the last part of it you feel really warm and die peacefully?
In short this video can be summed up by just 2 words: You die
2:15 voice break
Let's just all agree that if your in the UK your PE teachers will not give one it you get hypothermia and still make you do football in the snow
Here in michigan this is VERY relevant right now
2:14 voice Crack hahahahahahaha 😂😂😂
Yeah  so what  I almost  drowned 6 times.
Big OOf
They spelled environment wrong lol 2:14
2:13 nice little voice break
2:13 nice little voice break
3:35 11 weeks or 11 hours???
Yeah so it snowed 15 inches in mid oregon
冷
I do not understand a thing
I live in Hawaii why am I watching this
Is this because of the frozen homeless people in Chicago
Whats the song
would you rather freeze to death or burn to death?
You guys said 11 weeks but wrote 11 hours on the white board
Lol my body is almost all the  time only 36.6°C
If negative matter does exist, what is it made up of? Is it antimatter or are the two different?
11 hours or 11 weeks?
This is a HORRIBLE. 😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure that only when the body temperature drops below 35.5 degree celsius will the human be considered to have hypothermia (normal body temperature ranges from 36-37.5 degree celsius)
I have Raynauds syndrome. It's when the body feels cold even in warm weather. I run about 10° cooler than the average person. When its 80°, its like 70° to me. Right now it's 17°, 7° this morning. I do not go out at all. Lungs go into a very mild shock to breathing that cold. I know that from experience. Had this since birth. At my age it's either retiring in a nursing home so no need to set foot outside or go to any far southern state. I hate winter so mych I have no words to express it.
How much probability of freezing in the -40C with low humidity?
Your balls shrinks and your blood becomes ice.  There
3:40, Revision, when the temperature drops is not prevalent.  When the temperature drops to sub Arctic degrees, seek shelter faster than an Atheist in a foxhole. Clothing and attire matters, however warm shelter is the Only real thing that matters.  You can dress warm all you like, but you will sweat under your warm attire and freeze faster because of it.
it is a silent killer , your body will want to go to sleep . been there did that in -20 ran out of gas on a back road , lucky a logging truck was going to work found me . i was on the brink of being froze to death .  just 2 miles from a gas station but it was closed at 3am .  logging truck found me at 8am.  my body could not move i was shivering so bad I could not even move my arms or legs .  lucky he had a warm truck to get me into .  I was 250 miles from my Home worked on the road , had to be to work at 6am .  I was a little late , but alive
Please like so ASAP can see. I love your videos, i learn a lot. But I would really appreciate it if you stopped getting political like in your wall and racism videos. In a world where people want to learn more and more, educational channels should stay as objective as possible, so that people can focus on the science and form their own political opinions. Thanks, love your channel! (Bill Nye’s instagram, take note.)
lmao u die 😂👌

2:20 typo
Wait... 11 hours or 11 weeks....
Wair a second, this might be a stupid question but....  if glucoses is used to produce heat, does exposing yourself to cold make you lose weight?
Am I the only one that thinks the background music sounds a lot like the terraria snowy ice theme music?
Can the sun burn you to death??
Lol its over 42 C in my south american country
Can you do a video about whether it’s possible to freeze your body and come back to life in the future?
I live in the Caribbean so sucks to be you guys
i froze to death
This video is fake news. Han Solo was frozen solid and survived
FORA HANNNAAAAAAAA!HUHUUUUU
frostbite...the worst thing in the winter
How about death of high temperature
Still rather freeze to death than burn to death
Isnt 37 celsius.too hot
“You Die".
This is America
I heard it's better than burning or drowning to death
He wrote enviornment at 2:15
@AsapSCIENCE you guys have great content but always put in some very very odd information. For one hypothermia occurs when your body’s temp drops below 35 degrees. 37 is average if I have 37.1 I don’t have a fever and if I have 36.9 I’m not hypothermic. In another video you said juul pods were $16. This was hugely problematic because vaping is a smokers getaway and you discouraged it by saying it was more expensive even though it is way cheaper.
Russia is colder than Canada
I haven’t even gotten frost yet.
Are those cat scratches on your hand??
It's negative 20 In Michigan
I was the only one that could take the heat, as to why I did the deliveries. The truck had the engine inbetween the front seats, had gaps so engine heat be in the cab. The shop had no A/C, nor did that old truck.
Really, Rose?
that minecraft music
Canada isn’t that cold tbh
I’m watching this in the cold..
Your kidneys fail from the increase in blood pressure to your core organs, causing you to lose control of your bladder and piss yourself when shutting down. But you won't feel it, you're numb already.
what would happen if the internet shut off globally? 
(like this comment so they can see it!)
Coincidence
R.I.P Syrian babies ☹️
I have a question if someone’s able to help. Near the one minute mark it sounds like what’s being explained is that once you reach shivering stage, that’s when you can develop frostbite. I’m just confused as to wether I’m interpreting that wrong or not, as I have gotten mild frostbite on a few occasions without having been in a shivering state?
Minecraft
Is he reading a script?
3:34 sooooo... 11 weeks or 11 hours??
I don’t live in freezer
It makes sub zero scary
What happens when we get too hot?
here in indiana weve had school canceled for 5 days straight.
You freeze to death thats what happens.
Now do extreme heat and heat exhaustion and heat stroke, i’ve almost had a heat stroke and have gotten heat exhaustion a few times here in Houston.
You freeze to death , duh.
I'm watching this video and my heart breaks for all the animals that freeze to death because of human selfishness and carelessness
Umm.. U spelled environment wrong 2:14 😬
Russia has joined the chat
So basically your body’s like no wait warm this part! No wait send blood here! No wait now this parts cold! Shiver here! GET NAKED!!!
11 weeks or 11 hours?
11 weeks or 11 hours?
Well I'm pretty sure you die
Just use wim hof method
I think you die
Have any studies or attempts surrounding triggering the non shivering thermogenesis for weight loss been attempted? If so what were the outcomes?
11 weeks or 11 hours?
Why do our bodies hurt us in an attempt to help us??
How was there a survey of people freezing to death where the surveyors didn't help the victims? (2:40)
Don’t you just die?
Usually, you die to death.
It’s so gross they get gangrene of black on their skin their limbs fall off 😂😂😂
titanic
Why does this music feel so pushy? Anyone else?
why does it feel cold for a split second before feeling burning hot when you put your hands in super hot running water?
Everyone else "OMG ITS -30C!!" 
The UK: OMG IT SNOWED A BIT ITS THE APOCALYPSE
Now what happens when you burn to death
midwest gang wya?
Why am I watching this I live in melbourne where it’s 45 bloody degrees
I’d rather burn to death.
here in Michigan...
So Titanic passengers are still alive?
So are we just going to ignore how they spelled environment wrong at 2:17?
You tend to die
Really, Rose
I’m from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada ! I’ve had three snow days this week because it’s been like -48°c (at its coldest) , scary to know what happens
wow.
Captain America has left the comment section. .....
What up Winnipeg fam??
Background music is so bad
Ok, now I’m definitely glad they cancelled my classes earlier this week.
I recognise this music so much...
I sometimes wonder if humans were actually supposed to live in such cold climates. I mean, clearly our bodies are not suited to living in cold weather, without advanced clothing, shelter and heating.
I’m from Connecticut and when I was about 17 I remember my aunt dropped me off and I had to walk about 5 blocks to the train station. It was about 10 degrees outside and snowing and I literally couldn’t feel my toes or fingers within minutes. I could barely walk. When I got to the train station it took my hands about 15 minutes to unfreeze. Close last I had to frostbite. I can’t imagine actually freezing to death.
You die i think.
Shane Dawson
Frozen
Disney Walt
Can y’all explain why I experience Raynauds attacks in my fingers in the cold? Is it the beginning of frost bite?
honest question, why did you say "humans don't have furr like our ancestors" do you have a conclusive evidances and links to evolution ? or is it still a theory ? i mean from what i read there are still missing links and it's just a theory but i also heard that it's a fact for some animals and i mean that they evolved but not for humans
I feel bad for all the homeless people...
Good thing I’m so fat cause I never even need a jacket till it’s below 15 degrees Fahrenheit, and I’ll still sweat and burn in the jacket
11 weeks our hours?
sweden
Then how do ppl get frozen when they die to come back to life later?
I guess you die
Cool.
Yeah but where is the terraria ice biome music
my fatass thought it was lasagna
I had a quail chick that got too cold I thought it was dead so, I put it in a warm place and it came back.
TLDW: You die in real life.
I HAVE A QUESTION : What happens when you burn your self 1st ,2nd,3rd degree burns
Asap as per my histological studies Brown adipose tissues are present only in infants not in adults
I know what happens: you die
What happens is you get cold n die
MCT
Who’s freezing while watching this
Where is Justin Y.?
You Die?
So your body burns lipids witch is fat so you can lose some calories while your freezing
I’m still cold when I’m inside my house
a kid here in vermont was just found dead frozen to death yesterday and THIS shows up on my suggested
So what’s colder? Canada or Russia?
Terreria music?
Next video what happens after u die...
03:34 so 11 hours or 11 weeks?
It’s so cold here. I’m in bed with the heat on right now. 😬😬
Can u do one like this but what happens when u over heat and die
Let me guess, you die?
What happens when it’s 2 am and you have a test the next day? You end up on YouTube watching videos like this
Imagine how many homeless people died this way this winter. It's terrible.
Spoiler alert: You're dead ;P
I am visiting minnesota, and you can get frostbite in 5 minutes. you can die in 10
What's the science to Xanax!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????
Die duhhh
What’s 37 degrees celcius in American
It's been cold enough here to cause a water main to break and a heavy amount of flooding in the streets which promptly froze.   It's getting bad but hopefully it'll go away soon. The place I live is used to cold temperatures(usually not THIS cold though but Yoopers can handle any cold temperatures the Earth throws at us).
U die duh
Hi! Could you please make a video about ways to cope with/heal depression? It would mean the world to me!
Really?  We surveyed dead people?
I have fur... It sucks
Maybe they stripped because they knew they would die and didn't want to suffer so they stripped to freeze to death faster
The change of music and tone freaks me out
Sounds like a great way to lose weight
You die I’m guessing
you die end of story that’s what happens
Yea maybe that’s why you don’t go outside naked
Yolar
What happens when you eat too much?
how many tampons will it take to suck up all of the water in the ocean?
ofc i get this recommended to me after it was -55F earlier this week youtube trying to be funny huh
Wim Hof
Lol frostbite in 5min here right now
Hey ASAP science. Can you please make a video explaining why there are only two sexes and not 94 like those stupid people believe please
brown adipose tissue only exists in newborns
I feel like it's possible that people stripped off their clothes because they were going to die anyway and they were so miserable that they wanted to die faster.
What happens when you freeze to death? ... you...freeze...to...death...
omg i just watched shane's conspiracy theory video and was thinking about the disney frozen movie conspiracy and then this video shows up and oh my god illuminati confirmed
Let me gues... You die?
I’m from Montana, so I’m basically a diet Canadian. I’d rather it be below zero than over 70 degrees. We aren’t made for the heat.
Wim hoff
Eh
Can you guys do an episode on chronic illnesses and how they affect a person’s daily life? (And how annoyingly named they can be (like dysautonomia))?
I’m pretty sure that there is someone who can control when they want to be warm. Like their brain sends signals to their body to make them warm. Anyone else heard of something like that?
What happens when you freeze to death...you die.... duuu
U die
well um you die
Can we stop dissing on Rose for a hot minute? Yes, the mythbusters proved it was possible to get them both out of the water, but it took them multiple tries and they weren't in freezing cold water during each attempt. Rose getting in and out of the water while they both tried to fit would have killed them both. FFS. What's the point that they both would have made it if they'd just died trying for that outcome?
You wont actually die 
You will freeze for centuries until someone gets you out

Works just like a freezer
At 0:16 they say that hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops below 37°C. This is incorrect hypothermia sets in when your internal body temperature drops below 35°C. Please fact check your information Asap Science. Disappointed.
You know whats colder?




My heart 💙
Spoiler alert, you die.
You’re insensitive, there’s a polar vortex plunging through my state right now 😫

You get cold as ice.
Them: “which face is the oldest” 
Me: “obviously B, but I’m sure there’s a trick, my high intellect has given me the ability to detect this.” 
Them: “answer is none of them”
Me: “I knew it, they are all the same age”
Them: “they were made by AI” 
Me: “shit.”
Lol now even AI is evolving to catfish us
All this new technology is more concerning than impressive tbh
*gives only 0.2 seconds to guess*
This video was made by AI
they tricked us into watching a security system commercial
None of them faces are real.. these faces were all generated by artificial inteligence
Me - Slowly clicks away
Joke’s on you. I am an AI viewer.
imagine seeing a really hot person but she/he doesn't exist and was generated by AI sksksksk
Anyone else scared for the future of politics with deepfake videos?
If someone asked "who's the oldest?" and showed a realistic pencil drawings of a teen and an elderly, I'm sure people would be at least a little annoyed at them for saying "neither, because they aren't real". That's how I felt about the three faces created by AI.
its scary, thinking how AI can be misused. 😱
i’m very proud of myself for spotting all the fakes. but honestly it was really scary how realistic some of the fakes were. if i was to see or hear anyone of those videos/ images on the internet without being told that one is fake then i 100% would believe them all.
I know what deep fakes are because of Shane Dawson, so I could tell the fake one right away!
15 seconds in and I’m already really confused... just the way I like it.
I got all wrong.
Anyone interested in brain transplant?
On the video call one I knew B was fake because it said thank you for your time.







Should that be worrying?
Can you guys do a video about the science behind asmr? I feel like you guys could really make me understand it because personally I don’t really understand it😂😂
But i had Seen the B person smewhere🤔🤔🤔🤔
Lowkey I thought the oranges were fake... they looked too perfect
“None of these people were ever born”

i screamed when he said they were “never born”... i wasn’t expecting that...

Why are people so mad about the first question it's as if you defamed them and destroyed their lives not as if you've shown a little trick. The point of it isn't to get the correct answer, they didn't expect you to because it's impossible. They tricked you, not into getting the wrong answer (as there literally is none) but into believing there was a correct answer.
I wish I had the power to revert time to when times were much simpler......

Flashback....
”There’s hydrogen and helium”
You would have gotten me with the music one...
 if I hadn't already learned prelude and fugue in c minor by Bach ;)

(I typed this then watched the video and they said it was by Bach, darn this would have looked more impressive if they didn't haha)
4:08 But what if the intruder dressed up as a pet??
am I the only one that is spooked by the faces?
"None of these people were born" My brain was still telling me that they were real but that something terrible happened to them.
You can tell A is mechanic cause B has the little puffs of sound dampening that a real piano has at the end of each note
Is is sad that none of these fooled me (except the 1st 3 faces one)...
Right from the beginning this is hilariously flawed: you ask which person appears to be the oldest, and your answer is lol they aren't real people. Whether or not the people actually exist is 100% irrelevant to the age they appear to be. That is not "tricking" a person's mind, that's just being horrendously misleading about you presenting them with. Here's one for you: I have an apple and an orange, both the size of a baseball, but which one weighs the most?


Haha, neither, because I'm actually holding a cat!
I watch carykh and this is way too easy man
what if i proggramed the AI , would I be superior to the AI . lmao DBH
I have a question? How do we get freckels ;-;
r/totallynotrobots

RIGHT FELLOW HUMAN?
It's actually a burglary that occurs while you are at work in your home. A robbery would include a individual person being robbed.



And yes, this was generated by A.I.
Them:wich person pic is the oldist
Me:a
Them:none
Me:0_0
I do not know what to say for you asap science hahaha 😂😂😂
0:28 Oh yeah, my friend 'min max E [log(D(x))] + Ey [log (1 . D(G(g)))]'! He's such a funny guy
I knew it was Bach as soon as I heard or lmao!
“None of them were ever born.” 
Me:”shit. I’m dead”
B (trick question)
(X) Painting B is AI
Mathematicians are notoriously bad artists, just saying... I actually didn't even notice the "signature" (too small) until they blew it up. 
(√) Apples is AI
Wtf even is that, those are not apples... Going back and pausing I can see they're actually the same image of the oranges, the apple one just has distorted colors.
(√) Track A is AI
Music is about emotion, Track A doesn't have emotion.
(√) Video B is AI
There was something off about it, video tearing or whatever it's called.
(√) Voice A is Human
Voice B sounded digital.

PS. My choices were more "what was my initial lean towards" rather than a thought out decision, so from this I learned I have good instincts at least. Maybe give people more than 0 seconds to think. 5 would probably be fine, most stuff like this on YouTube gives 10 though.
Pronounced.
"Yohan Sebastian Baccch" 

With a rolled c
I got every question correct except the "Never Born" question.
Bro I guessed all of them right (except for the first one)
Guessed all of them correctly (except the first 3 faces) not because I could tell but by predicting whether the person chose to make the fake one first or second based on how they chose to order them before
I heard track b and my mind went "oHHHHH 12 YR OLD PRACTICE TRAUMA HERE WE GO"

that piece made me v sad :(((
Edit: track b is fugue ii in c minor by bach. I should practice it again
okay but why did I manage to get every single question wrong lmao
AI cant create art. Its not how it looks, its the meaning.
Oh, gods.




Who am I?

This vid just made me question life.
This tricked my mind, or did it? *vsauce music plays*
oh my godd i was right on literally all of them
i mean i guessed "none of them" on the first one but i guess that counts
I’m getting carykh vibes from this video
I literally got them all right... idk i guess i have a good attention to detail, i always found something off with the fakes
What if all the comments I'm reading were computer generated.
I have just been click baited.😭🙁
track a 1:27 is "From Darkness, Light - 2. Fugue"
1. B well I was wrong 
2. The first one OMG I WAS RIHJT
3. Oranges Wrong
4. The first one computer YES I WAS RIGHT
5. Video A is right YES I WAS RIGHTTTTT
6. Voice B is real I WAS WRING
0:31 wtf 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀
In conclusion:
Anything that's real is fake
I Told You





Arnold Schwartzenegger's Terminator is right
15 seconds in the video and I'm Already so damn confused... just the way I like it
What if I told you I was actually in one of the pictures.
Me: Will this trick your mind.. hm.
Mind: NOPE NOT TODAY
I don't agree with your pronounciation of JOHANN Sebastian Bach
OH YEAH YEAH!
Voice B is basically every scammer over the phone
Congratulations on your new home (nice to know I'm not the only one who leaves home convinced I'm about to be robbed)
 🏠🌳
I'm already confused
And on a bright note, I've never locked my doors in 38 years. One time when I was a kid, we left for vacation with the front door open (a neighbor shut it for us after a few days).

I don't lock my car either.

I've never been robbed.

Of course, there's that one time when it happens, I'll probably go "oh shit I guess I should have locked the door" but if that happens... I'm still not gonna lock the door.

Shit happens. I'm not gonna go through life terrified of losing material items that are wholly replaceable. I grew up poor. Material things are just things.

(I do wanna get one of those video doorbells, just for the nerd factor.)
Which came first light or dark

How fast does darkness travel 


Why do people even buy Pokemon cards?
AsapSCIENCE why do we get a dopamine rush when we see our favorite youtubers replied to our comment?
Am I the only one who gets kinda scared that AI can do... anything it wants and fool us? 
And if AI composes music or paints like a human, isn't that bad for our artists? Okay AI can't actually generate something completely alone, it needs tons of data to analyze first and then it mixes up what he learnt, but still, wow
This is so eerie. I have chills running down my spine.
Could you please make a video on the structure of a nuclear reactor
I didn’t understand anything please say something I can understand 😕
I don't necassaryily agree with your politics,  but  this was a good video
1. Someone watched this video and said that they look like that person.
2. Obama and the voice call made it obvious
Was it just me who couldn't tell which was which every single time?
I..... got all the questions wrong lol.
I guess I'll be the first to die when robots take over
Someone has probably already said it but...

1:27 track b is a fugue by Bach. I recognized it, that is the only reason why I could tell the difference
”Science is amazing!”
”Technology is incredible!”
Not sorry for that.
You didn't really conclude the video...you just jumped right to the sponsor.
Hey fridge! Call McDonald’s and ask if the McRib is back.
Just gonna put Greg on blast like that lol.
4:15
They're cute together




(If they're actually together then I'm gonna scream)
AWWW YOU GUYS BOUGHT A HOME?!
BLESS YOU BOTH! 😍
#RelationshipGoals #M&G
the only reason I knew the fake caller was because he said "thank you for your time", which is fake af bc customers don't value service worker's time.
That bruh sound effect caught me off guard.





Edit: 
make it harder pls lol
So...um... It's like only my 3rd day out here -// ~(0 -0)~
I can't even read the title right, I thought it said  "This will trick your mind" ahah
if AI fruit is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
The Skynet is here!!!

And this video is created by deep mind.
i knew the music cuz i've listened to emily howell before
Congratulations on your new home!! <33

Ahhh!! You made deep fakes not sound so alarming lol damn you, Shane! 😂
These didnt really trick me.....
Am I normal????
This blew my mind. I'm also not a robot. Tomato bubblegum socks though
Deep fakes has deeply disturbing political and  social applications. If you think about it, back than a video recording was one hell of a strong evidence or proof of things for the public absent from certain events. Now that they became so easy to fake it is getting really hard to tell the difference between propaganda and reality. But what even worse is that it plants the doubt in our mind about everything we may ever see in the future.
think about it:
1. a war broken out between Mexico and the USA, here is some footage 
2. a politician admitted corruption, we got the footage to prove it
3. scientist landed a succesfully cloned camel on the cloud city floating in venus higher atmosphere, here is the video
4. the UN succesfully erradicated poverty, here is some background footage from africa's  former poorest countries, which are now booming
5.  here is the exclusive footage how scientists actually managed to manipulate atoms one by one under a scanning tunneling microscope
6. we have footage of the enemies of the state as they conspire and plan terror attacks
7. we finally find the old films that proves that historians lied us in our entire life and nazi germany actually won the second world war, and the declaration of allies victory was a cover up
8. we got the video from the secret Nasa archives which conclusively proves that the the earth is flat

Would you trust the avarage Joe to discern which unbelivable thing actually happened ?
I got all of them right but I second guessed myself everytime. Haha
«They where never born» 
Man that really hit me...
Creepy...
if you tilt your head when looking at the thumbnail, it looks normal
Only one I got wrong was the music composition... 


Funny cuz muh major

0:31 Bruh Sound Effect #2
Didn't like the video that much because I saw nothing like the thumbnail and this device has phantom headphones constantly connected to it.
What if we were living in a computer generated world.






My motherboard hurts
I guessed everyone right except the who was older trick question

Edit i guessed B
The drawing of you guys is so cute!!
Music one is so easy if you know...

Bach
Sigh... to all of those who commented about "They asked which was oldest", not "which is real" I just have this to say.... The answer is, they are not real, therefore none of them are the oldest. It's not a trick question, its to show you how seemingly difficult it is to tell whats real and whats not.

If they asked "Which is fake" and responded with "They all are" That would ruin the example that they are trying to make.

Did you actually READ the title of the video? Yes, they ARE trying to fake you out. and I doubt ANYONE got the answer right... and that's the point.

Thanks ASAPscience! As always, you make great videos!

Also, I got 4/6 of them right! I was surprised by that!
it's crazy...i could tell the fake and real every time...it's like the music/art/images of the AI are soulless
Got 3 outta 5 correct, the pictures of 3 people & the A.I. music fooled me

More importantly though, could I get paid for determining reals from fakes?
Just for anyone reading this, a robbery is an offence that occurred that involves someone using force or intimidation to get when they want. 

Someone breaking into your house isn’t a robbery, but a break and enter. 
That was my ASAP Facts.

If the voice at 2:57 is so dang good, THAN WHY DOES SIRI STILL SOUND LIKE A TOASTER?

P.S. Every other vocal assistant too. (maybe Alexa a bit less)
Not too hard to pick out the fakes. 
In music, listen for tunes which are perfectly regular; real music has slight variations. 
In voices, listen for unusual inflections. I actually got that last one wrong because the call digitized Caller A's voice for a moment. ("Hello" at 2:58.) On listening again, Caller B actually had a lot more of those digitized tones, but - confirmation bias at work here - I missed them because I was already convinced A was the robot.
Art is a little trickier. And I got the Obama clip right primarily on intuition. 

Beautiful dog, btw!
I got all of them correct.
Even the fake question at the beginning!
I just say the opposite of what I think is real.
Well, I was fooled! >:-(
That is so scary
I knew all the music ones because I am a musician!
I just thought of a really good one: 
Why do songs get stuck in heads?
if i got em right can i like write this on my resume or something?


IS THIS EVEN A SKILL?
0:11 
that's dark...
Fun fact: the guy who coded the AI posted his code on Github. Some guys (legally) used his code and printed the "painting" we see in the beginning. The made 400K+ and the one who originally coded the AI... $0,00 😂
Confusion 100.
I got every question right.... I'm an artist by the way 😋
Voice b the question just sounds fake
1:50 His name is Bach, not Back






BaHHHHH 

not BaKKKK
Was able to tell the fake in every example. Definitely advanced AI
This is how you get everything right. just say the opposite of what you’re thinking and you get every question right
The Obama video was discernible because the lip movement was slightly off-sync (or artificial ?) in the AI generated video.
CAN YOU SEE GOD ?

Imagine if we could design an AI robot that behaved exactly like a human being, as intelligent identical physiologically play football sports musical instruments drive use phones computers hold a conversation it could think but it wasn't self aware, it's abilities were programmed responses like Siri or Alexa, but then after a few years you found a way to develop a program for self awareness

It would then have self control and awareness of the technology of the AI design and all things it 
could do that was designed by humans to mimic human behavior

But when you installed the program for self awareness and the robot became self aware, it believed that it was doing it all

By itself

lol.
I got all of it wrong.....
This is how you know AI will take over the world
This is fake🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Take this Test, Will it Trick Your Mind?
How many Genders Are There?
2 or Attack Helicopters
The Answer? Lol. You already know the answer.  You silly helicopter you!
the fake obama video was obvious because the face doesn't completely match what he's saying. the fake voice was obvious, because voice b was too "clean" if that makes sense? too quick and monotone and robotic. voice a would drag out consonants, kinda slur their words a lil bit.
1:50 Haha on option B I was like, wow this AI is actually making really good music
U together?? If yes aww
The first one I was like WHAT
unrelated but those are some beautiful oranges
I don't know what's real anymore
the music thing was easy for me , simply because i have extremly good ears , if i hear a music once, i  will recognize it , the first sounded good but it didnt sound familar to me , i cant say which bach song it was but it sounded familar 

just now to find out what the music from bach was,  i searched for a video with his most famous works , after listening to 2 seconds to Orchestral Suite #3 In D, BWV 1068 - 2. Air, "On The G String"  i was like "oh thats what that one is called " i recognized it after 2-3 seconds already , dont even know what movie or whatever it was were i heard it , buti  recognized it instantly , i even kinda think it was some anime , but i am not sure (i just know the moonlight sonata was in detective conan)  


but the other things , kinda tricked me , i must admit kinda tricked me
I got all of them right except the Obama one
"Inset Bruh sound effect 2"
So if I got every question right, am I a robot?
Curious but silly question: did any of your videos ever got demonetized?
When AI can do better art than you
These trick videos have always been creepy.
Wow, such an improvement, the last one got me tricked! ;)
I lost 2 braincells after watching this video.
Carykh would be proud and happy right now
Fake obama's lip never changed its lower part so I knew it was fake
My answer to the title : yes it did. 

I cant trust anything anymore. Its such a scary world.
idk why but i thought all of the three people looked similar, like their vibe...u feel me? but i just went with A LOL
"Modernity had failed us"
No the reason why video B is convincing is the background
The phone call was watching easy, because the umms, don't sound like that and all the sounds fit close together.

Plus u could hear the real person breathing
i will never trust anyone again how do i know they weren't made by AI
Yoooooo, i got all of them right
I actually thought the voice who gave the hours was The IA insert Thanos meme about reality
shows 3 pictures and asks which is older HA!!!  YOURE WRONG BECAUSE THEY ARE A LIE!!!!!

but you asked which is older.....as in age.....not which is real.....as in actually alive......
OMG! It’s the beginning of the Matrix! 😅
Now you tell me 
AM I FAKE OR REAL ?!?
Noticed that the eyes are stuck in one position looking dead
This comment was made by an AI.
This is quite the illusion
I got all except the first right im scared
You guys are Canadian and we usually dont lock our doors I dont blame ya🤣
I got them all right besides the faces am i special sjsjsj
This is so goddamn terrifying.
After the first 2 I got all of them right! Sweet!
0:03 imagine if somebody watching looks mostly like one of these
I only got the last one wrong
Welp
I’m not worthy
BRUH SOUND EFFECT #2
It didn't help with the music one that I recognized Bach's piece XD
LMAO THAT SIGNATURE I LOVE IT
I know that track A (1:32) is fake because I've heard track B before. It's Fugue 2. I it fugue 2? correct me if I'm wrong.
CLICKBAIT!!
I'm shocked I got them all right save for the oldest face one that was a very misleading title.
vsauce music gradually gets louder in background
Shane Dawson better give you credit 😂
Bro I remember when that obama video came out that one almost fooled me
0:26 of course it's A because I don't think AI existed in 1901
I love the sponsored message like "what's really important to us with this alarm system is that it looks cute" 😂
The title seems a bit like clickbait. Still enjoyed the video.
Now if only we could teach AI to tell jokes, and to troll masterfully...
now please don't say my girlfriend is just the google assistant
This video was surprisingly eerie...
I wanna know how I got every single one of them right.
CONGRATULATIONS ON BUYING A HOUSE!
i think  you should title this video 'machine learning/ai' instead
Wait are you guys a couple?? Or just friends living together???
Dude, YouTube’s algorithm screwed you up
I got only 1 right😭
This makes me wonder about how this will shape future laws
wait the two dudes who run the channel are in a relationship??
I'm genuinely scared even though I can't live without technology and gaming and pc building and internet.. Future is scary man..
There's a lot of memes in these comments
Got everyone except for the voice one.
The music one was easy. There's like a softer music behind each note that doesn't sound like any period from music
That  conversation with the AI guy gave me black mirror vibes
Woah this really blows my mind! Like what is actually real 👀
Ahhhh I can't get a single one right
0:12 if their never born than how come there is a picture of them
This whole video was easy because, well I've already studyied the topics here.

Unless you're a scientist what YouTubers do is basically a report on a subject, where youcollect information on the topic or you're not adding any information  other than speculation.

Although there are channels like the humanist report and Game Theory, and somewhat lockston. gnogin.
This video was terrifying, thanks!
Nothing can fool me, I am smart bot, artificial intelligence
A robbery occurs when there is a confrontation between two parties, where one is trying to forcefully take from the other.  On the other hand, a  BURGLARY occurs when someone breaks and enters onto a someone else's property, intending to commit theft.  Just a friendly lesson from your criminal justice nerd! :)
"Who do you think is the oldest? A, B, or C?" 
Alright even If picked one you'll probably tell me something unexpected and all of this pretty much becomes pointless, but I guess I'll go with B




SON OF A-
When you failed with all the tests given..
You can't trust the system, Maaaan!
i guessed every single one except the first :D
Non of these is tricking me, And I don't know why🙂
This is honestly scary
Jesus I failed every single question...
0:31 Bruh Sound Effect #2
Can you PLEASE make a video on 'what happens if you stop taking WHEY protein'
The music one actually blew my mind!!  It's hard to believe that track A was produced by a computer.  But I have to say, I died a little when you pronounced Johann with a hard J, lol.
I dont want to brag but I got every one of these tests correct. I was suprised too
0:31 Bruh Sound Effect #2
Congrats on the new place!
0:31 bruh 21 my name jeff bruh 21
Detroit: Become Human 😱
As a channel purporting to support science, facts and math, you repeating the claim that a robbery occurs every 15 seconds is quite obfuscatory.

Assuming it’s true, and you assume the US population is 325 million and that robberies are well-distributed (they’re not), then you have a .646% chance of being robbed in a given year. The expected time per robbery per person is about 155 years. It’s disingenuous to make this sound scary.
the music illusion didn't trick me, i know the Bach one
Let us bow down to our new machine Overlords
I got everything wrong. Guess I am a bot
Bruh how do you leave the house and not close the door? I lock the bottom lock before I leave anytime.
I played prelude and fugue on the piano so I got one right lol
For the first question, it doesn't matter if none of them ever existed. You can still answer the question of who looks the oldest between them regardless if they are real or not.
Thumbnail looks like a cannibal from Streets of Rogue.
On the synthetic audio voice B sounds kind of like Jack Black
I thought it said generative advert cereal network. Yes, this did indeed trick my mind
holy shit i legit got NOTHING right
Oh I didn’t know we were doing trick questions.

What’s the easiest way not to get hurt skiing...don’t ski.
It can’t trick my mind if I don’t have one
Yohohohohohohoho
GOD DO I LOVE ME SOME TRICK QUESTIONS
It's cool that you can like make music on machines....but I hope that doesn't take over the world.

Real music is hard work, like actually playing the piano, or flute or violin. Idk just something about making concertos on the machine is just....not right
T H E  M A T R I X  I N T E N S I F I E S
I love you guys!!!😘
Catfish will be stoked about this technology
Are we going way too far with this Artificial intelligence thing... ?
This is actually creepy not cool tbh
I’ve just realised how smart I really am.
Soon Ai will be controlling everything.
Am I the only one who got EVERY single one wrong. 







Maybe I’M a robot?  😱😨😰🤭🤖
Now that's creepy
I AM CONFUSION
I'm pretty pleased to say I spotted all of the fakes, except for the painting (I assumed the more detailed image was the fake, because I was anticipating a trick). Most of them have subtle flaws, like photoshopped images or CGI with weird seams; the Obama video's mouth movement was slightly off in a few places, and the audio over the phone sounded stitched together, for example.  It's probably only a matter of time before AIs start to figure out how to fix these subtle flaws, though.
I actually got quite a few of these correct..
Schooled straight away goddamn
1:33 i played that Bach fugue when i was in school, so i didn't have to guess :))))

edit: i wrote this before he said the name. i thought he won't.
1 robbery every 15 sc in USA; like wow how wide is USA again ?
I got all of them right. Looks like I'll be the one leading us in battle during the AI rebellion. Thank me later... 

But seriously just thank me now.
Oldest is subjective it can be which was generated first.
This video taught me nothing other than about your sponsor! FFS!
Y'all need to make some vids with that good boi
Somehow ik whatever my brain thought was fake was real so ultimately i wasnt tricked, whos with me 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
i got the apples and oranges one wrong i will not survive the apocalypse
Frick, I dont like it, thats freaky.
Bro I got one right!
Congrats on the house guys!!!
nope I got every one correct 
HA
Wow! The phone call impressed me so much. The technology today is really creepy 😅 And in a few years your ordering a pizza and then you are talking to a machine 😂
1:27 I said this one because it sounded too clean, too perfect.
I got all of them right yessss
Markus painted painting A.
I got all of these right lmao
Hey, this is AI.
Congrats on your new home 💕👬
I got all right. But ask the same question.
I got all of them wrong... :(
you two are the cutest couple i have ever seen!
You can generate stuff without GAN
They never borned.....
So scary then to see them
lol i got pretty much all of them wrong bc i thought they were like trick questions bc the right answer seemed to obvious to be correct lol
Jo-Han Sebastian Bach =yo-Han
You didn't "trick" anyone.
Lol I'm a music major so the music one did not fool me at all. I LOVE Bach.
this couple is adorable and I stan it.
I only knew Track A was fake because I know Bach Fugue in C minor when I hear it lmao
I M surprised because I guessed all of the AI stuff correctly.
I got it right each and every time
I got all of them






Wrong
Oh yeah yeah AI is pretty smart.
All i pick is the wrong one and yes i am confuse
I was pretty surprised I only messed on the first question between the three people and the music one
Bruh sound effext #2
That moment when you get none of comparison right...
I got my friend's face exactly same with C
I legit got everything wrong
This is a little frightening to me. 
We're never going to know what's real and not in the future.
i was fooled by the faces, fruit, and music, but not by:
-0:20 the signature, easy
-2:20 the fake obama mouth didn't wrinkle or move when he closed his mouth after words
-2:54 saying hello then hey, after the real guy picked up is stupid, and then who says "okay. got it. thank you for your time."?
Emily Howell is very distinct from Bach
I wonder if people will use this to frame people
this is scary...
wtf...
Thanl you for a bit of clickbait. This allows me to learn more I guess
I only got the first one wrong 😮 I'm amazed at myself
I guessed right on all of them yay
Simply safest just like smart things
0:31 You played the forbidden sound
Well, humanity had a good run I guess.
I was able to spot all of the fake images because I'm an artist and I spend so much time just looking at things since It's part of my job. I also know how image generators work (in a layman way) and noticed how the fake painting's face was warped and other irregularities. 

The apple picture has that weird part on the bottom of an orange, but on an apple, so it was obviously fake to me, like it was generated from the orange picture.

Music B sounded better and familiar, so I just assumed it was the real one. I thought phone call B was real just because I expected it to be a test for a new automated service AI.

I did not see that the first images of human faces were fake though.
i mean WOW, mind blowing. blur the lines of fake vs real even more why don't you...
I just really need a video of Greg doing the "hahaha, ryan " vine
2nd cutes couple
How do you access this AI technology? I would love to play around with this stuff for fun!
Was always right :D
I've been FOOLED BY THE MACHINES! THE AI APOCALYPSE IS COMING!!!!
AI entering the art world destroys the purpose of creativity
I was able to guess every fake. The music was very obvious. Track A had no emotion
Man AI is getting stronger, but we human get tricked by them!
2:07 I chose A because his skin and voice tone seemed more genuine. O_o
I definitely need that phone AI bot for my social anxiety
Is this philosophy, or science??
Soon ai will be making robots that look hyperealistic.. maybe even to the point where they are literally their own functioning organism because nuts and bolts aren’t “real enough”
Barış özcan da bunun videosunu yapmıştı tavsiye ederim. 
 Youtuber Barış Özcan did this style video ı think see his video :)
Lmao ai can speak better than me
3:18 NO #### DUDE HOW WOULD WE WATCH THIS VIDEO IDIOT XD
They can't fool me I got em all right (Ok let's be real the 3 faces can't really count as who tf would have thought they're not real,there was no way lol!).Although I must admit that was probably more of a luck than skill.This might get out of hand someday,like that AI Obama.Pretty soon we will have to question everything and everyone.Someone will call you and we all be like : Are you even real?Prove it.
A.I is going to take over the world 😰
Whelp, we're about 2 years away from the robot uprising
Just watched the first 15 seconds : Whaaaaat?
This video is also fake .
When you watch it using caption so you can't see the AI signature
I somehow got them all right
I guessed all of them right
big moment for the bruh button fandom
Can't wait for this to be used in games. Imagine importing your face and voice into a game instead of making an avatar that would be really cool
I was guessing the whole video lmao
i didnt fall for any of this apart from the fake people, i feel so proud 😂
I wanna cancel AI now
One time a raccoon set off my neighbor's (Jacob on my YouTube channel, Casper Randominator) alarm
When he said that none of those people are older because they’re non existent I got chills
I proud to say that I detected all the fakes on all the tests...apart from the 3 faces at the beginning.
For "smart" guys, y'all need to learn the difference between a Robbery and a Burglary.  What you portrayed in the vid was a Burglary but stated Robbery.
Quick fact: did you know that 100% of people will die?
Wow maybe one day I'll date online with an A.I. without knowing he's not real,some kind like ghost 👻
I will never get old of the music they play in the backround! It fits so perfectly
Got them all right...
Ugh, pet peeve.  Robbery is stealing stuff from a person (with force).  Burglary is breaking into a place to steal stuff.
Detroit become human
Who else got everything right
Only the last one fooled me. That Voice A sounded so robotic.
the Obama one and the one with the call were obvious, Obama didn't "look" natural to me and the fake caller had a weird graininess to it that was a dead giveaway.
Well, I am actually pretty shocked that I got all of my guesses wrong.
I’m an AI. Or am I? VSauce music plays
i got every question wrong and now questioning the purpose of humanity
For the phone call one, I knew caller B was fake because the AI said "I wanted to know what are your hours" instead of what I would've said, which would be "I wanted to know what your hours are".
Brain.exe stopped working
Damn I knew all of these
Simulation Theory Confirmed!
Why is the only black man in the animation  the robber?  😂 Simplisafe
No joke I just got every single one wrong.
the human mind can't generate new faces, but AI can
bach is actually an alien ai sent from space to revolutionize music so the music one is technically incorrect
Wow, this is dangerous AF, imagine how easy wold be to fake any video.
Only a few years until our new machine overlords take over!
I could tell the music one before it played the other one
I got all the real fake questions wrong, illusion 100
Did he say "J"ohan? It is pronounced "Y"ohon.
I got them alright except for the Obama speech. Very impressive software learning.
I got it all right! That was hard though.
That ad transition was so  smooth.
Watching this high makes me feel like Im in school again in a classroom in the 5th grade.
ILLUSION 100
Aside from the first trick, I managed to tell which was fake every time..... the AI always has the most generic one
Bruh Terminator is gonna happen in real life
Bamboozled again
I got them all right I know my species
That's actually terrifying
I only got 3 of the questions right
0:10, asap science is following in the foot steps of grade A under a's racism test
Got everything right 😁
Finally realistic Obama video games😂
I could tell the music one easily.  There wasnt as much punch or personality in the fake.  The call one was easy too. Same feeling or sound as monotone and almost weird or artificial replies. The people is images of living people compiled so i kinda think its a cheat to say an ai made the images but wherever.  The fruit one could be easily deducted by looking at the outline of the apples or blurriness compared to the meshes in the oranges.  The orange were clear and flush next to each other unlike the apples. When u know what to look for the differences are obvious
Congratulations on the house !
Dam on some real shit the first test is one of the only one I didn't get right. The faces honestly are so detailed and real that the only one the looks even remotely fishy to me was the one in the middle. from observing
Haahahah... All the video is about a product ???? 😁😁😄
Hey asap can you make a video about what would happen if the world is only populated by women 😐😐😐😐 that would be hella interesting
bet you nobody will like this comment
Im very creeped out yet extremely intrigued
i got them all right 😊😊
My every answer was wrong
So basically Photoshop?
Okay cool but where is the illusion?
This is incredibly scary. Am I the only one freaked out by this
1:06 Somehow, I predicted that this would involve a feedback loop and I didn't even hear all of it up to this point... weird.
1:33 I knew it was track A that was fake because the moment track B played I recognized it a little.
Oh yeah yeah





Also I’m so close to 250 subs pls help
Genjutsu
Next we're gonna have games  made by AI
The AI is a paid actor
i'm kinda afraid by the intrusion of AI in the human society :|
I answered them all ✅
100%correct
They’re coming ever closer to replacing all of mankind.
0:13 I guess they belong to the ILLUMINATI
Dude yikes when the phone call happened my home phone started ringing
I feel a strange sense of loss (?) that none of the faces existed.
Yay! I'm stupid! I lost them all
I KNEW VOICE B WAS FAKE CUZ NO-ONE IS THAT NICE ON THE PHONE.
trick question, AI makes real things, and can be people too.
That classical piece was too easy to recognize as man-made if you've ever heard it. They could have picked something more esoteric or obscure.
I only missed the voice one
Sooooo... your sponsor is just like other home security systems. Cool.
Detroit: become apple
Ooookay. AI making video messages is kinda creepy....just me who thinks that? Okay...
0:31 Epic bruh moment ammirite?
Everyone of these has fairly obvious flaws and if u listen carefully you can see that it sounds unnatural and computery AI still has long to go but yet it's so close
Gotta get those deep fakes

If you know what I mean...
Age picture wrong but got all the rest

oh yeah yeah
"Bruh sound effect 2" 0:31
They just told about their security system to about a million people and said it was hidden
i got all of them right except the first two with the people and paintings
I got everything right except for the never born thing
0:40 Did you ever realise that those are the exact same image, just with different colours?
With Obama I can tell the video is synthesized because of the quality of the video, on top of that it looks like synthesized color instead of real images recorded with a camera.

Those two descriptions were basically saying government cameras are shity and the one that looks like it was recorded with an iPhone X with artificial blurring is also a product of a i
If you pinch yourself and it hurts, are you too strong or too weak?
Deep fake Obama
——————————
         Is gone
2:53 Introverts must be happy about that one.
THAT "Bruh" IN THE PAINTING ONE GOT ME
Wow...now watching "Real" videos will be harder to determine if its real or not.
Great vid, I said B for the first one and was not expecting all to be fake ha but got all the others right, scary how real they seem though
gj guys you've done it. You're cute.
AI's make better music than most pop artists nowadays.
Am I the only one creeped out by this?
This is how they will get us. Fakes will cause people to go to prison unfairly.
WHO IS A GOOD DOG! AHHHHH
They are so cute <3
are you two married or dating
I spotted all the fakes once I was told to look for them.
Had I not been on the alert for fakes all but the apples could have fooled me.
Oh yeah yeah, this did trick my mind
When ai composes music better than bach
Yeah, but.... you're Canadian.
Dejavu.... we've been here before people. ☺😐😮😯
Weird I was able to spot every single AI generated image and sound. Even the people at the beginning of the video
Telemarketer called right after the video ended
Those are the best looking oranges ive seen
Why was the robber black😂😂
im suing i thought voice b was real
I suspect Russia will be using AI to generate propaganda in the upcoming 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.
Besides the first example shown I could tell what was real and what was AI throughout the video but they're all very convincing. Can't get fooled by AI yet
You asked which face is the oldest, not which one of these people was born first...
This is kind of terrifying
What the shit, I got all them correct
It is not even tricking my Mind a little bit
Have computers passed the Turing test then?
The voice B at 3:13 was actually Google Duplex at work. It's so creepily real.
That’s soooo terrifying 😱😳😰😵
Damn, I was wrong at all the answers
Oh yea yea
how would we know they were never born tho lmaoo
I got them all right lol
Who is the oldest




NOne oF ThEM
“At some point in the 21st century, mankind marveled at its own magnificence as it gave birth to AI.”
Y'all so good.
Wow thats crazy.
I got them all right 😊
We're going to die 😂
2:39 both are fake cause he never stutters in the vids
this stresses me out haha
Hey guys congrats on the house seriously. I’m glad this account is doing great I’ve been watching your videos for a while now. Im happy to see I can enjoy more.
I want se more or that cute dog :*
Spotify has a green logo not yellow
I got every answer wrong.
What I if told you

You that read wrong

You read that wrong too
bruh sound effects #3
Yay I got them all right except for the first one.
Okay but like I got them all wrong 😑
Voice B sounded more real though! This is so scary!!
they are taking over!
0:11 yes, BUT one of those faces had to be created before the other two. So one of them is the oldest 😜
b r u h m o m e n t
Cool but I wouldn't call these illusion.
OMG THE DOG IS SO CUTE
Girl or trap?
What if the intruder IS a pet??? 🧐
How do we know our universe wasn't generated by AI?? .-.
I only got the first one wrong heck ya
i failed the turing test :(
this is just fckd up, i dont see the positive effect, i just see so many possibilities to abuse AI like that
America has a robbery every 15 seconds. I thought you guys were Canadian...
It's pretty easy to tell composition A is by machine - but only because whomever programmed that AI and set up it's database, provided it with very shitty (probably extremely compressed mp3s) audio files.
3:00 when he said ummmmm I instantly thought it was AI
This is getting scary.
1:50 cough ＹＯ－han
i got all of them right. no ai can trick me
Bruh!!
Oml I got a lot right holy shiet
I smashed the button to get to so hard that my phone fell over. And I have a popsocket on my phone
Oh wow I only got the music and the video right
Included paid promotion huh? the whole thing is the promotion :/
The ending 💞💕
i failed identifying each fake .... is anything even real now
What about vocaloids..?
I knew the Obama one because of my iconic queen shane Dawson ;)
3:06 right there, that’s what gave it away nobody pronounces it like that
I got all of them right...
I wouldn’t be surprised if the terminator actually happens
I guess that the auto-generated caption was also made by AI
Why does the thumbnail scare me so much
In 3:05 the voice b is fake because there is no human in the world that calls a company and asks nicely in what hour they open.
I got all of these correct
i got tricked by the robot.
Can we seee your dogggggggggg!??????!
Basically the movie cam on netflix
Called all the fakes, made me feel very human.
I got all of them right.
Is Florida not part of America any more the drawing at 3:35 didn’t have it.
Am I the only one who's scared after this video lol
Does somebody know the name of Johann Bachs composition at 1:34 ?
That BRUH came outta nowhere
bruh...👌
This is scary. What is our world becoming? More lines are being blurred.
So, basically what Facebook did with the 10-year challenge.
The woman in the thumbnail looks like Sam from iCarly
your questions are silly.
The only ones i got wrong were the painting signature and the fake humans at the beginning everything else i got completely right💪
Imagine getting scammed on a phone call by a computer
"alarm system that automatically contacts the police" that how you get your dog shot up by a cop.
Interesting lol
Can AI make me famous?
Video feel flat too much simply safe not enough science
I got all of them right!
Have you tried breaking in your own house to test the system
I got all of them right.. except the age one
You could hear the sass in his voice when he said “it reminds you when you leave the door open cause Greg literally does that all the time”😤🙄😂
ㅤㅤ
So if I don’t go to work I will get robbed less? Safety accomplished
This two people is AI, this channel is AI.
I got all of them right lol apart from the first one though cos no one was expecting that lol
I got all of them right
I don't know what isn't AI anymore
Yeeeaaa this is crazy
I dont feel safe now.
Its pretty obvious what ai made and what people did idk man myb its just me
Skynet is coming.
Does anyone know what piece track b is, I’ve heard it before but I can’t quite remember
You can tell the fruits and the music
I guessed most of them right :D
I got all of them wrong! XD
bruh moment
Got them all right apart from the phone call
Something about AI being able to create real looking videoes and photos is just wrong...
Was I the only one who was really sad when he said those people were never born? I was like „awwww whyy, poor things“
I’ve got all of them right except the first one
3:22 Oh that was smooth
1:56 YOU ACTUALLY NOTICED GOOGLE PLAY NOBODY EVER DOES YAAAAAAY
0:11 ... That's weird... Because I know all 3 of those people.
Maybe it’s just me but you could kinda tell which ones were robots because they just didn’t have much emotion to them, like the music for example, as soon as I heard the second one filled with emotion I knew that was the real one
The think is that humans make mistakes or errors whereas machines never make mistakes and that is why  we are still able to identify machine different from humans .
If we want machines which cannot be distinguished from humans then we have to make machines which makes mistakes on  purpose.
This is insane
i guessed every single test right
Do anyone knows what's the title of that music by Bach?
I guessed all correctly out of luck
What if a pet IS the intruder?...
With the first one problem was the wording I was expecting something along one of them is fake not all of them, I screwed up with Obama video but the rest I nailed somehow I just know what is real and what is fabricated there are certain imperfections to each of the real thing and with Obama video I screwed up because it had way to many details like the shining head that thrown me off. In other words the game is on Sky Net.
17 robberies happened since you’ve started the video
Got them all right
Are you two a couple?
That is not a "Illusion test"...
I knew the music one because I saw a video by codebullet, where he made an ai synthesize music.

I would have figured out that a did it before it finished if it was longer, but I knew right away once I heard b.

As of now computers learn to write music by copying patterns, but they don't understand what makes music good.

Or they can't write a unique piece, they can only fit random puzzle pieces together that they copied themselves.
I actual found the didifference between most of them because it a bothered my eyes or b my ears
Oh really, so i am an AI
Damn. I didn’t do that bad, got more than half of them right
The music one was easy but i'm also a classically trained musician. The phone call freaked me out the most.
I love how much I can learn about human behaviour from robots built by humans to mimic humans.  They're less complex, for now, so if they can be people, I just need to program myself.
Dude wtf you can make someone with young or old with AI so B is the right answer
Our life is easier yet the cost of living makes us all broke
Congrats on the new house guys!!
Am I the only one who got EVERY single one wrong?
Question- What if our population were to double over night. What happen to the planet. Also what pros and cons would happen due to the sudden change. Would people over populate the planet or could we think of a way to save both the people and the planet. From things such as pollution and or maybe an increase in violence?
It's a scary future..
AI dislike this video
AI left the chat
What is we made something so perfect with ai
I know nobody cares, but I got them all right
I don't know what it was about voice B but it just sounded fake. I think I might have completely crushed every one of these. That is bizarre.
grey did a better video on this ages ago
My brain melted
Opened my mind...
the only one that tricked me was the first one
who else tried to get it right by choosing the opposite you think?
You need a new door
not to be that guy, but i actually correctly guessed what was fake for most of them
asked which face looks the oldest....B...if ai made it or not B looks older
Robots are taking over
Imagine if someone with one of those faces watches this video
Y’all are the cutest couple
This is horrifying
0:31 B R U H
Voice B obviously fake, that uhhhhmmmm is do typical for google assistant duplex duhhhhhhhhh
I dont want to brag but... Im gonna. I got em all right bibiii! Ain't no computer gonna fool me!
Thanks Apple one was easy, if you look at the Apple towards the middle you can see it has the little divot that you see on oranges. In fact, it looks as though the apples used that photo of oranges as a sort of template.
MIND = BLOWN 💥
I have an experiment for you.

Why do people think a word is not real when they say it alot of times? Example: vine
I only missed one.
i got most of the guesses right cus i actually guessed the more “robotic” sounding one to be human, huh
If these 2 broke up youtube would be broken
I got them all right, except the age one.
Wow...
Well I failed
I guessed them all right... but then again, I don't go through my daily life assuming things like phone calls and videos of the US president are fake, so.... I Too Am A Fool
I'm confused!
The oldest one is the one which was created the first by AI.
what is iridocyclitis (did i spell that right)
Did you really just pronounce Johann with a J? I mean I'll forgive the hard k sound in Bach, but come on.
The piano won I new a was fake right when I heard it
One word... SCARY!
i mean i spotted all the fakes
I didn't get the "Illusion" part.  AI/Neural Networks aren't illusions.  They are just machine generated.
The only one I got right was the apples... I'm slightly worried!
Gonna get high and come back to this video
Can someone list the songs used in the audio illusion? Both sounds good.
does anyone else think this is related the Shane’a upcoming new video?
Is the caller one google duplex?
The music one was easy to detect
deep fakes intensifies
2:53 it's like Google Duplex.
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
how...is this...an illusion
Wow, beeing afraid of robbery.  Strange.
This is so scary wtf
All of the answers are B
I missed all...
Wait are you tall guys a couple
The music would have tripped me up if I didn’t know the Bach piece already
Okay, yall gotta help me. I used to have an iPhone where I can listen Sidenote on Podcast, but now I have an android and I don't know where to go to listen. I NEED HELP!!!!
Oh yeah yeah
I got all of them right
Does somebody remember the movie The Running Man with Arnold? they had fake videos like that...the scifi comes true.
3:10 no because the audio quality sucks on both
THIS IS TERRIFYING
4:08, what if the intruder is my pet?
I got every right
I guessed it all right
I got them all right
I was right about what was fake except for the voices T^T I was so close.
Are you a couple?
If you really think about each you can easily tell which is fake, but at glance it may seem pretty real
I'm the guy on the right in the beginning.
3:33 They mean a burglary right?
I guessed all right
For most of the video I thought they where saying a eye
ok but did anyone else get all of these wrong? i’m big scared lol.
Shane Dawson does a video including deepfakes and suddenly everyone is talking deepfakes. Coincidence? I think not.
I’m always getting the fake wrong. I choose the other. Who else?
Watching this after Shane’s video😕
Is the ai painting aaron burr?
Hey Vsauce, Michael here.
I don't like any of this
i got them all right....
ok for almost every test i thought the fake was real....
3:34 what happened to Florida? Did it just float away?
3:34 what happened to Florida? Did it just float away?
3:34 what happened to Florida? Did it just float away?
Didn't fool me even once.
None of these tricked me
Lol only the real music nerds knew for sure that music track A was fake because they heard piece B before
3:21 Vegeta! What does the scouter say?
The bruh part was cringe
Another reason to add fuel to my luddite fire
2:25 one of Shane Dawson’s theories
WAIT IS THIS VIDEO EVEN MADE BY A HUMAN?
The fake ones sound and look odly off
This is fing scary
It's happening ladies and gentlemen.
What if the intruder is disguised as a pet?
got everything right except the fruits
Are you guys couple? Like, romantical couple I mean
Okay so the important part is that it’s cute... not the best advert I’ve seen
wow i got all the questions wrong
Who else got all them right ?
0:30 0:30 0:30 0:30 0:30
We have a channel that hasn’t been invaded. Oh yeah yeah
why'd you leave off half the continental states in the flag
Do I know if anyone in the comments is real ? 😳
I got the last two wrong and the face one
We all screwed...
This is not okey
The music one is interesting cause track A doesn't seem to have any sort of personality, like it was midi generated and track B feels like someone modulating the music to their own.
Yeah AI is gonna take over us
I got them all right. What’s wrong with me lol
This is creepy af
Why did this scare me
I guessed most right
I got them all
kinda makes sense that the melody I found more pleasant was made by AI since it was probably trained to find the most common melodies and therefore the ones we theoretically enjoy more to develop its own music
0:31 bruh.mp3
I could tell which one was fake for every one of them. But they keep getting closer and closer which is pretty creepy in a way.
thank you, but can you guys please do a video on why babies smell so good?
Haha those AIs can't fool me
People that cannot pronounce Bach
who stared at the thumbnail
So this is how the algorithm is gonna take over
you guys are awesome
These are not illusions....they're literally better version of fakes
butter face
This comment was made by AI
OMG is that the weed tuber guy at the end Mitchell Moffitt.  It has to beeeee.  He called his viewers the Moffitts and like I miss his channel.  It's not him but its the other guyy
Bruh, this is just the start of A.I. thinking for the benefit of the betterment of itself or along the lines of them starting to become completely and totally independent of human connection. Shits gonna get hairy man.
Are you guys a couple?
My brain hurts
I got all the fakes. Needs to trick me better :D
I got some right!
This gives me trust issues
I am real person or am i?
I don’t know about art, but I do know about composition, and there were a LOT of things that gave away which compositions were fake.
I got the 1st one right 
I got the Apple one right 
I got the music one right 
I got the Barack Obama one right 
I got the synthetic audio one right
Pff that’s actually pretty cool
i only got 1
So, the Deep State can take over the government at any time having a fake leader give speeches to fool the people?
SimpliFake.
Jebem ja mater onom ko je meni provalio u kucu, dok sam ja bila na poslu, PLUS jebem mater onom ko mu je omogucio da to uradi ..i ne zavrsi u jebenom zatvoru.
Last minute of this video is just an advert for a security system
The end is near..
Cam girl will become a reality
Skynet, is it you?
I got one wrong
Guessed all of it..
I got all of them wrong..... Welp I'm not  becoming a cop :/
I got about half wrong.
I got all of them wrong ):
Robberies here happens while we are at home....
Emily’s howell is showing
The shanedawson effect.
I actually guessed every single one of them right. Not even by luck, just by using common sense. These AIs think they can fool me! Pfffff! Who do they think I am?
Please dont let these robots make the captcha cards humanity would lose
Actually I am quite surprised I could tell most of the real from fakes. The last 5% is the difficult journey
0:14 u wot m8
This is threatening and we should stop it
1:33 when you are a musician and you know that's Bach from the 1st note
your mom was made by ai
so that means, AI is smart enough to compose a fake news story, and people will believe it.
Soon they’ll take over
Ai can’t fool me lol
Video ends at 3:23
Do your brain on DMT
I got all the "tests" right, there is still a slight weirdness to fake stuff, like the composition sounded soul-less and the voice sounded too scripted.
This feedback loop of improvement... doesn’t that have something to do with the singularity?
I knew the phone call one too cause he said hey and hello too much
HHHHHHHH DOGGGGG YEESSS
You guys should do a video on gender dysphoria
Omg it’s the squip duN DuN dUNnn
I guessed the fake ones!
I'm scared now
If AI can do these things, it probably can fake my voice or your voice to say: hey I hate world peace and I’m gonna kill thousands of people. 
And then someone somewhere is going to hit a bomb on a city and the person whose voice got faked is going to be punished...
Now you may think I’m pessimistic but that can(and probably will) happen very easily...
This is terrifying,  because surely video evidence could be falsified for example, leading to defamation of a person's character/ conviction of a crime where none has been committed?
Does it mean anything that I was able to guess correctly all the fakes in this video
this is easy im thanos
This was trippy
this is very scary ....
shane dawson anyone?
imagine the future of porn fakes tho
I m wondering is reality real or fake
Terrifying
What does it mean if I got them all right
SOLD OUT
Kizuna Ai is the best AI
Why do we remember things we want to but when we need to remember something we don't remember?
I just want someone to make deepfake easier to download and teach and use.
The click bate tricked my brain.
Oh the dress is blue
So... the Turing test...?
The AI in charge of the oval office right now needs to be tossed out and replaced with a more convincing fake.  Unfortunately, it seems as though the AI for spotting fakes is failing as he hasn't been tossed out yet.
So this is like proof that robots would take over the world one day
I recognized that was Google's new voice thing right away. What they've shown as examples all have the same inflections. Gives it away
Just wanted to say that a home can't be robbed, only burglarized! Robbery is a crime committed against a person by attempting theft through force or threat of force. So I can guarantee your home won't be robbed while you're away!
Houses don't get robbed.... people do. Houses get burglarized.
AI going to make click bait
AI going to make click bait
We’re already watching this video, while life orbits all around us; does that not mean we’ve already bought into the illusion?
Dont watch this high
I'm a musician... the only thing I got right was that question about a Bach 2 part invention...
I guessed all wrong.
This is scary
This is scary
This is scary
Not saying I’m smart but I figured out the fake immediately for almost every single one. The only ones that I missed were the faces and the voices. Everything else to me was immediately picked up on as real or fake. Anyone else?
I have not watched a lot yet and I have Failed everyone but the 1 on 1:46 which is fake
oh yeha yeah
SkyNet is here 😳
Wtf how did I get all correct
0:09 I bet there are people that look like that though..
AI is scary 😟
Shane Dawson has entered the chat
Most of these, i got right. I didn't guess that the pictures in the beginning were fake. And "caller B" sounded more real than the real person.
anyone know the piece of Bach?
Unfortunately, I only got all of the answers correct because I'd been exposed to them before--either knowing the exact fake or identifying the real one from my past memories; i.e. knowing the quote and expressions to the letter from Obama's immigration speech. So... more examples, pls! Trick me with new stuff!
How tf did I not fail in finding out what was fake?
3:35 run.
deep fake need to get sued
All i guessed were wrong one...hell
I am not very fond of AI
His voice is genorated
Are they a couple
0:30 BRUH
Is this the real life?
Fake news. 👨
The first three I got wrong along with the Obama video, but I got everything else right, so I don't feel so bad... for now.  But dang is it scary how these fakes are getting more and more convincing.
wait this guy has a boyfriend that’s super cool i never what have thot
Except for the first question which was a trick question, I (somehow) got all of them correct. But basically all of them were just wild guesses. Except for the Obama video, I knew about that one.
I could tell each time which one was AI
Yup. Eventually scientists will make a fully realistic human robot and send it out into the world for a test to see if anyone can tell that it's a robot. The robot will pass(no one will be able to tell)
I got all of that wrong...
00:18 How is it an illusion
Still waiting for an AI made gf.
The thing i fell for was that i thought i pressed the dislike button instead of the like :p
0:31 BRUH
AI is evolving...
i is smart now
The AI was a paid actor
The AI ones are the ones that seem too real of that makes any sense
Are we sure Asap team isnt AI
I got every single one wrong... I’m scared now...
Ok, I'm pretty sure the people at 0:10 exist. Come on, 7billion people! What are the odds of them not existing?
Apart from the never born thing
The only ones I got wrong were the first one (lets be real though, cheap twist 👀) and the Obama one. The music was a pretty good fake though, I just happened to recognize the Bach piece :P
Scary scary
I got right each time! SimpkySafe is crap tho!!
While this is pretty cool, its kinda concerning too. I can see populists faking famous poloticians speeches especially with the video and audio being this authentic
Man I got all this wrong wrong wtf is life
Im sorry i sound stupid but im clueless whats an AI?
I caught every fake visual one, but every fake sound clip I chose was AI. I got confused with the Obama one cause the way he blinked in the real one looked weird as hell, so I assumed it was fake x.x
I thought the music one was the easiest because B had more intensity in the notes. A was just very monochrome despite being a very good melody.
Ayy I’m pretty familiar with deep fakes of know what I’m sayin
Was I the only one that could tell the difference between real and fake? Still amazing because if i was presented it in a normal situation i'd not think anything of it.
its kind of easy to tell which is which, ai wouldnt make mistakes and follow a "perfect" way. in doing that, it can break common sense and make it sound off, like the initial song played, the keys sounded off(to me at least). OR like the example of the two people on the call, one was saying exactly what you would hear in a movie or a script while the other held a more human way of speech.
Was this made by Shane Dawson?!
This isn't okay! when AI is smarter then half your friends, like bye fam i got a new friend and she doesn't judge me LMAO
This is scary.
That thumbnail is what I kinda look like sometimes when I get high and look at myself in the mirror
I truly worry for this generation if nobody could tell the difference between the fake one and the real one. Just shows how shut off the majority of people are in the world.
When did you guys move from Guelph ?
3:34 that america was definitely not drawn by AI...
They didn't even try with the Obama video. The fake is so obvious lol
Bruh sound effect No. 3
I was able to cant every single one (not trying to brag) I saying this because the AI one has no feeling and just seems fake. The music just seemed generated, along with the voice. Even though it seems like it, AI wont be able to replace actual humans doing actual things.  Theyre just to perfect and generated.
I thought they were trick questions so i guessed the one i thought you were trying to trick me with.....
3:50 probably shouldn’t tell the whole internet that
I failed at identifying literally all the fakes.
got all the fakes
Nah I’m too smart
Hahaa I got you on the call one as I know about the google thing you won’t catch me not today
So I held a schoolexperiment, the question was: what is the distance between you and your phone to the point where you can't hear it anymore? Of course on different sound modes. We had put it on the lowest sound mode and the distance was 34cm, we went 1 modr higher and the distance was 2m and 64cm, we went one higher than the previous one and ended up with 8m and 64cm the next one was 17m and 64cm the next was 36m and 64 and the next one was 76m 64cm and we did our best making the space around us as quiet as possible. We saw an algorithm in this (from 8 meters). You take the number of meters and double it than you take 1 and add it up, for the next one you double it again only this time you dubble the 1 too so add 2, the next one you double it again and add 4 (the double of 2). But this algorithm can't go on forever right? Because that would mean that if you put it on the loudest mode the max. distance between you and the phone where you can hear it would be 60km (if the space around you was completely silent).  I would love to hear an answer because it seems impossible but maybe there is a chance that it is possible? Anyway the final question is. Based on this info can this algorithm can last up to the point where the distance is 60km?
oh my
Im scared of the future
oh damn....that's not scary at all.....
Shane Dawson has entered the chat
I didn't click this video at first because the title was clickbait trash, but hearing it was about deepfake got me the watch. I just wanted to make that clear in the comments, I don't click clickbait if I can help it, so clickbait trash video titles don't get my click.
That was a cool video!
Oh yeah yeah bruh thats creepy yeah yeah
I identified all the fakes because they fell into uncanny valley for me. The video of obama didn’t make eye contact with the viewer, the music piece sounded stilted (there wan’t enough tempo variation), and the fake voice sounded like a psychopath...
The apples just looked...wrong somehow. Obviously these systems are still learning and need more practice
As advanced as it gets, I still believe that emotions are the one thing that  AI will never be able to imitate.
Anybody else get every question wrong??
3:51 "Because Greg literally does that all the time.  He leaves the door wide open when he leaves. " Shaaaaade. LOL  You can totaly tell who the saftey patrol of the house is, LOL.  I'm wit you tho.
it has begun
This comment is generated by Artificial Intelligence.
When it comes to art and music, I think humans will have a much easier time telling the difference between the 2 than other things.
Why is this in my recommended and why am I watching it at 2 am
Reality?
Hey guys, you are great! do you think you can do a video about "will robots get advanced enough to have the ability to think like humans in the matter of decision making". It would be very interesting!
😮
Obama thinks immigration is broken ? Eye
i wouldnt say its playing a trick on your mind, it's still an illusion but not a trick, more of a video showing how technology is able to mimic human behavior to the point where they give the illusion of being real. which is still insane.
is this comment fake?
Damn scary
omg........ nothing is real
Cant wait until we find out life i fake
I was able to tell that 2 were fake
Only got the oranges wrong!
I guessed all of them wrong
Only the voice calls, tricked me... 101001010101010101011
not cool
I cant guess one right -_-
It was pretty easy
😢
I feel like you guys are blending the advertisers message too much in to the main video. I’m not trying to be critical, I just don’t want the key messages of the video to get lost that’s all ❤️
Isn’t an AI only truly an AI when it’s self aware? Machine learning isn’t the same as AI
Am i the only one who got all right? Its easy to distinguish between an AI and a human because of some uneasiness on the sound and the pictures.
The dog though!!
What does it mean that I got every example in the video wrong? AM I AI ???
😁
😁
1000unlike generated by YouTube bots
God damn. What are the odds that I chose all the wrong answers. It messes me up so bad. Damnn. Am i that dumb or the AI just too good?? Please be the second one. :(
This is scary...
Dumb content
I just need A.I to tell me which one of my friends are real and which are fake
WHERE TF IS TEXAS??? 3:34
Howell?
How does Ai benefit our society? I just cant seem to grasp it.
The apples are not real
Wow dis cool
Humans are the worst thing to happen in this Universe.
I don't need ai to tell me what's fake I know real when i see it
When all the faces are fake. 0:31
Wrong title
BRUH
Aaaa gat people
BRUH
This video is fake as well
Am I the only one who got nothing right?
bru
People can't kill you! That's illegal!
BRUH
The Obama one was easy to tell. His lips did not sync up in the second video.
Not to toot my own horn but I could tell the difference in all of them.
I am the WORST at this
google will lead us the way
Lol that Obama lipsync sucked, better work next time AI
I would never have known the fakes were fake unless I was looking for it.
I always like to count the music in videos and this one bothers me cause I really like 4/4 time and 3/4 time and I don’t know what time this one is in and it infuriates me I think it’s 6/8 tho
Oh 💩 💩 💩. When the time comes when we can’t tell, what is real or fake, how will we be able to judge anything? I can claim that a video of me saying anything is not proof that I said it, because it’s fake, and no one can’t debunk or affirm it. It will make all evidence inadmissible...
Are you guys brothers?
Shane dawson has entered the chat
ᴏᴍᴏ
You are AI
But what if a dog breaks in to your home?
Im high af and at a point could barely tell the difference between real and fake
The AI are paid actors!
But what happens if the pet is the intruder... Hmm... How about that...
R u g4y ?
actually 1 of the 3 pictures can be oldest because if you look at the average age of all of the people that the program used to manipulate them, you could find out how old the average age was
Why that bruh tho
OMG J. S. Bach??
I just went on a school trip to hear people play that yesterday!!
OMG OMG IT SOUNDS SO SIMULAR!!!
Do a video on why none of these fooled us/me? How can our brain tell it is fake. My eyes can't tell but I just know, right away. Something is off.
It probably will fool me because I’m stupid
did they just put a bruh sound effect in there?
Lol he black faced the robber
Anyone else get all the a or b ones wrong or just me?
Fix that door it looks disgusting
Unsubscribed. Clickbait. 30 seconds of info with a 3 minute ad.

Can we get an AI to make realistic looking CGI in movies? I don't think I have seen one CGI monster or animal that looked even rometely realistic.
bruh
Bruh
Why American statistic when you guys live in Toronto?
Well at least I was able to automatically tell which piano was fake. As a pianist I can tell the difference between real and fake
Didn't trick me, I knew which ones were fake and which ones were real.
I’m bouta take war on robots
I got Barack Obama right bc his lip-syncing was off when he said "shooting" in Video B.
Awful title !
How can I get everything wrong? Am I not a human anymore?
I thought painting A and the orange were the fake. Holy shit am I an AI?
I could tell every fake. Not lying. Don’t believe if u don’t wanna.
The computer generators were generated by computer generators
AI does not exist .... it’s just more and more code.....
Cant believe the intrudor had to be a black guy. Smh
Um.... why is no one getting a little uneasy about this?
Dude the oranges look like plastic toys
Didn't find it too difficult to spot the fakes...
3:51 what even is that door? it looks gross.
I guessed correctly every time it was a AI. 

The difference is very small, but if something seems a bit off or too perfect, its the AI

0:25 painting b is Dio Brando

Big thonk
Trickd
That’s was to freaking easy
Is this comment real or AI?
so therefore a computer is able to tell an apple rather than a orange, and i can’t
AI needs to be regulated, if it isn’t we’re bound to end up in a world just like an episode of black mirror
Shane Shane Shane oh my I saw this in Shane’s video
If evolution is a fact why are we failing to address it? It seems like majority of the worlds population seem to deny the fact.
2:13 I'm sorry Mr Obama. What did you say? Did you say something that will make your followers today angry?
Did they move America?
But won't burglars use AI to learn how to break your house, without ever actually trying to, just by testing the system remotely?
I dont like this at all
This is real life it’s creppy
Ok - in my eyes this was a kind of advertisement video I really dislike. Time to unsubscribe.
Can anyone know that what white board animation software does asap science uses
I'm gonna get a call from a girl in my chem class telling me to come over, get sent an address, walk over and get stabbed by a robot. Very cool, thanks AI.
... I am so out of loop
Congrats on a house in Toronto in this time of economic turmoil... 😂😂
As someone who loves machine learning and ANNs, this video was really hit the nail on what AI is capable
of. The explanations were also much more simple than anything else on YouTube lol.
The sass at the end 😂😂 “he literally leaves it open all the time” 
This is bae shit right there
that BRUH got me dead
I got all of the tests right lmao. And I wasn't just guessing. Something about each one to me was pretty obvious that it was trying really hard to mimic something and was just not quite right. 

The one that stood out to most to me was the phone call; the AI says "ummmmmm" which almost had me for a moment, but then it said "what are your hours for today?" which didn't match the pre-existing casual tone it had set up prior (like saying "heyyy" and "ummmmmm"). A real person would have phrased it more like "I wanted to know what your hours today are" or possibly said "what're" instead of "what are," especially since it's speaking in an American accent. The others didn't fool me for similar reasons.
I got every question wrong except the Bach one.
Who else liked the video just for the dog at the end
My Every guess was wrong 😂😂😂
AI gonna take over!
diverging from science towards software (SCIENCE = GOD MADE ,,  THIS = MANMADE)
What the holy f!!! This is freakin craziness!!!! Lol Interesting!!
OH YEHA YEAH
Will This Thick Your Mind?
That is scary realistic
ERNIE IS SO BIG NOW
Photoshop VS AI
GAN FTW!
You could tell which music was made by a human. Us humans are creatures that appreciate beauty and express emotions into artistic pieces, thats what makes humans so beautiful and why AI can never replace our humanity
Why do you call robots Fake? We are real!
Bruh
The original photo and voices were the only tricks that got me.
Luckily, with a good eye a lot of these fake images can be seen based on subtleties
This is a whole new level of scary...
16 seconds in, downvoted
But I’ve heard prelude and fugue in c minor by johann Sebastian Bach before it ruined the music test .-.
You can't believe what you see or hear.
Skynet is coming.
i got every single test wrong
0:15 okay...
DOGGO!!!!
🅱️ R U H
Artificial intelligence may generate faces but how can it make sure that people with these faces don't exist already.
Should we be afraid .....
I find it funny i picked the fake obama because his mouth movements were bad when that was what was supposed to trip me up
AI has gone really far to replicate things to a T! I find this real interesting because AI can create art!
I could tell they were AI because the pattern becomes repetitive.
I can see computer generated voices and people getting a lot of people in trouble, used to frame people and all kinds of other evils.
AI will take over by the year 2030.
I got all of them right expect for the painting .It's small details that give it away,are they convincing ?Yes. Can you tell the fake from the real one IF you know one is fake? Sure
Want some Ai music? Go to Jukedeck.Ai
carykh
Fascinating and scary video, guys! Good job!
I could tell exactly what was fake, I’m proud 😂
I got all of them right, the Obama one was obvious
The thumbnail already got me so ya know
The music one was very easy... maybe because I used to play the piano.
my favorite member of the asap mob
Im not weak minded
Sorry, but this is a bit too click baity.
Bruh moment 0:31
Lilmiquela
Damn synths
I got them all right except for the first one
I find the AI version each time, but I know it's only because I knew one of them was fake and it's what the video is about, but in another context some AI work would easily trick me to make me think it's real, and that's scary :/
Soon there will be laws for usage of ai. Shit gone too far
Knowing one was AI generated, I had no problems detecting each fake.
The voice test was the only one where I was sure which was fake. I'm guessing it's a lot more difficult to fake a voice than an image, because I could just tell even though it sounded like a real voice it was still somehow robotic
It’s not Bach it’s bahh
No
I AM VERY SCARED BY THAT DEEP FAKE!
hey
none of this was illutions or mind tricks.
deserves more downvotes for clickbait title
Why do I always confuse them with the guys in Pentatonics 😫
oh god my life is a lie 
Dont edit BRUH in :(
At minute 0:11 well how am I suppose to know
i literally got every one wrong...smh
Running out of topics I see
Y’all are my favorite YouTubers
Is This Video Even real?
Plot twist.... WE'RE ALL AI.
YOU'RE READING THIS, but we all fake.
Actually your whole world is just a huge computer simulation.
The movie CAM is real
I can’t believe they pressed the bruh button
These are pretty easy to tell. The deep fake wasn’t even convincing.
what happened there? the video has nothing to do with the title. strange clickbait because the real title would have been interesting anyways.
SimplySafe is not a good product. Can’t believe you’d recommend that. Just look up how to disarm SimplySafe
Oh yeah yeah
What the hell!?
With the AI deep fake u can tell it’s fake, or at least that’s something is off, by the movement of his eyebrows. It looks weird and off putting as they move at slightly wrong times during talking and move to smoothly.
It’s so easy to tell. The fake music had horrible musical dynamics and the fake voice had absolutely no emotion whatsoever. But maybe someday it will become hard to tell.
So we are still in the phase where AI is learning to be better humans before it replaces us.
I only guessed right in the music generated by AI because I love the fugue composed by Bach used in sample B
You can hear in the music.  Everything about computers is too precise.
Is this a David Dobrik vlog???
Not to brag but I could tell all the fakes. I'm just kind of proud of myself because I never get these mind tricking things correctly haha. :)
I find this immensely creepy
i feel like i got clickbaited
I took concert piano for 5 years and I did not know that was Bach...
I wrote a paper in college on this video in 1995. How's THAT for predictive intelligence!
How do we know that the artificial intelligence just didn't recreate the faces?
damn this is scary!!
lmao that subtle shade by using obama talking about immigration
Yeah the music wasn't even close tbh...
Wrong colours for the spotify logo guys
It looks like you need to paint.
Your door could do with a lick of paint lads.
What if robbers start using animals to steal from homes that have pets? PogChamp

God dammit Greg! Were you raised in a barn?
There is no explanation of thumbnail.
There goes everybody's job. We all will literally be servicing the machines with all the skill in the future. Lol
It’s pronounced as ‘Yohann’ Sebastian Bach
2:54 was that conversation from Google's Duplex experiments?
Jokes on you, I got every question right
Is it bad that I know b was fake cus he said ‘thank you for your time’?
Destroy the machine
AI still has a way to go yet as I easily picked out all the fakes but one (the music).
None of these tricked me lmao, guess i'm too much of a techie.. Kinda dissapointed by you guys, your quizzes usually put up a fight
Man, Im scared of the future now. Hehe
Netatmo does that, better :p
This is a very bad thing computers creating the art we observe, the speech’s for our leaders. We are abolishing human creativity
The Deep Fake one was obvious. I might not have guessed that it was fake on it's own anf with no context but next to the real one and with my brain already searching for the fake one it just looked super uncanny.
Vsauce Michael here, where is your face
Just a bunch of examples of AI generated fake stuff to go along with an add... There's a lot of science about AI, but not in this video.
bruh
Can an AI make a memes ?
We need to get rid of these AIs before they replace us.. how tf do we make money when AIs do everything? They're gonna take over one day have they never watched movies???
Basicly stolen from LEMiNO
I know track A is fake because I played that song from Bach. I LIKE BACH BUT NOT PLAYING HIS FRICKING FUGUE ON THE PIANO!!!
when you only figure out the track A is fake cuz youve played track B
The government is gonna start killing us and replacing us with robots
CONFUSION 
Oh yeah yeah
Now I want an apple 🤦🏾‍♀️
Great video! Congrats on the house guys. Yay. You're great at this adult thing. Also, can we get more footage of your beautiful puppy? Pretty please❤💖💚💙💛💜
Wow i did a good job guessing which is real and which is fake!!
I wonder if they used synthetic audio on Tupac songs
Who else guessed each one correctly?
The music one was easy because of the tone
Doggo is such a big boy now
I got them all wrong 😕
Listening to this video all I can think of is the prime minister will be a machine when it becomes the prime minister and no one will be able to tell as it will be extremely convincing.
Dear super amazing person reading this, 
    I hope you have a super awesome day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be happy about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always hope. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be happy, laugh, smile! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone loves and cares about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
   I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. I'm not doing this for myself, I just wanna spread the joy to everyone. Maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cuz i just wanna make everyone happy:)
Good job sliding that sponsor 3:18
Don't trust the internet ever again
Can you do why lips get chapped?
Don’t get simply safe ... I have it and it’s soo bad I’ve had 6 false smoke alarms which Caused the whole fire department to come. I’ve complaint to them multiple times and was not satisfied once. I even got hung up on within the first min of a conversation by there customer support. Not worth it
The painting thing is easy there's brush Marks and the eyes are uneven the airport one looks like a badly rendered picture
the most polite jake paul diss i’ve ever seen.
You know the drama is real when a science channel gets into it (0 cool 1k likes lmao)
This is the most passive-aggressive dissing video ever!
a callout that actually makes a difference
If Jake Paul and Asian Jake Paul would delete their channel, then the world would be a better place
You know you're messed up when a channel related to science is trying to teach you a common sense.
also , wow . 
even asapscience has to step in wow
I like how he shows a montage of Jake Paul when he talks about irresponsible behavior.
Dissing Jake Paul with scientific evidence
Considering Jake Paul’s IQ, he’ll probably not understand anything you said in this video.
You know you've messed up when asapSCIENCE makes a video about you and your actions...
Woah woah woah there ASAPscience. 3 for 1?!?! Ricegum, jake paul AND youtube itself!!!???
Jake Paul’s brain can’t handle this complexity.
The 1.1k dislikes are all the 9 year olds already addicted. Smh 🥴😭
I never expected a channel like asapscience to call out Jake and Rice. Just goes to show how ridiculous these youtubers are.
This is the most eloquent diss I have ever seen.
"I'd say my audience is like 8 years old to 16 years old so that's where I try to cater my content towards"

*Shows dead body
0:26 So the case on the right says, Real Car Lamborghini Centenario, Eeh they pretty much exposed themself, The site is rigged, There are only 40 Centenarios in the world, And none is for sale, So how are they gonna give you one if you win one? You need to wait 40 years or something because its not often u see one for sale, The car costs like $3.5 Million dollars i think
When AsapScience makes a video on Jake Paul you know there's a good reason
Why are they still even a thing
"When you're disliked by the YouTube community so much that even a science channel like AsapSCIENCE has to step in & call you out."
Looks like jake Paul did a little oopsie
See? Why can’t people call out people like this! THIS is kindness, you don’t get anywhere just screaming at people and calling them dumb, that only makes them defensive. I love this so much!
Thank you! He needs to stop posting, seriously
Jack paul has left the chat
when someone has gone so far a science channel has to talk about it
AsapSCIENCE dissing Jake Paul, dang now I have seen it all
You here the beginning of a bad diss track in the distance.
Imagine that YouTube tries to get rid of THIS video because they're so money obsessed that they want to defend Jake Paul
It’s pretty sad when Jake Paul has 17M subs and we were supposed to have flying cars by now....
A roast on Jake Paul by Asap Science? I'm in
5:42 with the automatic subtitles on... 
"Also we don't actually know d**k Paul so..."
Why does anyone think Jake cares. He has never showed once in the past that he cares about anyone.
hey here's a thing ima call out to further prove its a scam:
there are only 50 lamborghini centenarios in the world
25 roadsters
25 coupes
all have been sold and all have rightfull owners.
none have been sold to that compagny, and lamborghini disallows the distribution of the cars, because they are "gifts" to veteran lamborghini fans and owners that made noise in the car community or in real life. this is completly a scam, 
but we all knew it was anyways :) 
just a fun fact for yall
entire 9 year old jake Paul army hates on this video
When you have to educate an adult about something you learn in high school
ASAP science snapped
I don't think Jake Paul is going to be able to comprehend anything you said.... In fact I strongly believe he has no brain.
Considering that jake paul has only 1 brain cell, he probably will drop a diss track to counter your polite diss lol
JAKE PAUL + ASIAN = RICEGUM
This was done in the most respectful and educational way. I hope it gets in trending.
if you click the like button it turns blue
You know something is up when a science channel gets into drama.
Asap SCIENCE & Jake Paul is the video 
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING TO SEE ✨🤩👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
EA must watch this asap
Bruh you know it's bad when the science channel gets involved




Holy hell thanks for the likes!

“Cmon Jake, you’re better then this!”
-Someone somewhere
I'm a simple man, I see a Jake Paul call out video explained with science
I like
Thank you for attempting to educate the 'man'-child that is Jake Paul - your approach of calm, reasoned argument, backed up with researched evidence, is what sets you above many other Youtube channels. :) Sadly, I fear your efforts will be in vain. Jake Paul is a spoilt, selfish narcissist who doesn't give a flying whatsit about anyone else or anything other than how much money Jake Paul is making from his poor, indoctrinated fans.
you know you have hit a new low when ASAP Science has to make a video about you
Jake Paul probably didn't understand a word of that 😒

Btw great video on the subject!
However dis video is highly informative
Get well soon Jake😒😒....still miss bizaardvark  
😭
Jake Paul would not understand even 1% of the words in this video.
You know he's really problematic when AsapSCIENCE made a video about him
Damn even the science channels are dropping videos on jake paul!
Who would dislike this video? 
Like come on people
You have earned my respect. Good work
SAY IT LOUDER FOR JAKE AND LOGAN PAUL IN THE BACK 🙌🏻
I'm glad you guys are using this platform for this kinds of awareness.
We have to send Jake Paul back to High School
Did... You just high* key call out Jake Paul and Rice gum....... Respect
Skill cranes are gambling for kids

change my mind
*Dear EA Sports
Jake Paul has an ego taller than the Burj Kalifa and an IQ lower than the Challenger Deep.
Imagine even AsapSCIENCE getting involved, that's how you know you've gone far enough
Moral: don’t let hype beasts get sponsored by gambling sites
Amazing job guys. 
Love you so much. U guys are the best. 
Best call out video
AsapSCIENCE:Dear Jake pa__
Jake Paul: WAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLMART
You're currently on the Top Ten Best Finesse's of 2019
This is the kind of “calling out” video that’s actually gonna have an effect. Good job guys :)

This is amazing. Finally someone standing up, and with science. Y E S
I always assume I'm going to know everything to be said about a topic and I'm always presently suprised.
1.5k Are those who watch Jake Paul's videos
No monetization, very impressed.


Regardless, the message is very important.
Jake paul is the description of a mental health problem
Doesn't care how immoral Jake Paul and Asian Jake Paul...

There forever stay here
I love that even the comments diss Jake Paul
oh yeah yeah

New Zealand does have an age of majority on that page
Like most social media companies, Youtube doesn't follow their own rules.  Glad people are becoming more aware of this.

Such a great video ❤️ you got a new subscriber.

I have a question for you:

What if you study at day and night????
wow, very well handled confrontation guys! you are great
Hey ASAP Science could you make a video on the yellow stone volcano?
Could you do, your brain on lean/purple drank/sizzurp?
5:20 this is very true
I have heard people say "If it's not Jeffree Star approved, I'm not buying it!"

Let's hope Jake Paul single brain cell can comprehend this.
very well said. i learned more here vs school (mostly on me because im a bad student lol) cheers guys!
pls do a video on mewing/orthotropics
i have got a question why doesn't a clock work in space
I appreciate your effort, but the dopey kid doesn’t even know what silicon is. . . That’s literally middle school knowledge.
Im part of the 27% that never sees what ppl get sponsored by even it is my favorite youtuber
this was 100% the best call out video so farrrrr!! props
I cant feel addiction (Help me)
Thank you for this call out<3
jake paul won't understand this video anyway
A lot of states have the gambling age set to 21, there’s a reason
That's the way of doing it. thanks alot 👏👏
hey asap science! i have a question/future video for you, hopefully you see this, but what if there was no pressure underwater?
Imagine if Jake & Logan Paul Didn’t Exist
Did Logan Paul sponsor this video ? 😏
thankyou asapscience for making this video
I hope to wake tomorrow and see this on trending. Well done as always!
HEY ASAPSCIENCE! Can you do a video about alexithymia? I have it and I would like to know what you can find out and teach us about it
Jake Paul left the group chat...
Love this! Thanks for doing it
Damn even asap science wants to get in on the early 2019 beef! Well done 👏👏
Aren't opening packs on Fifa kind of the same problem. I'm probably wrong though.
Don’t gamble, kiddos.

No Gambling ❌
Better to watch tv
There’s no way Jake Paul cares about children’s or anyone else’s health :/
You know it’s bad when he’s talking about it
He will most likely copyright your video and flex on the haters
So, this theoretically a strike against Jake Paul?
Lemme go sort some “coffee”.
K, so im gonna define Jake Paul using jake paul logic, kay? Mhmkay.
Jake paul is a mental disease on his own! See!
Jake Paul is an anagram of Ligma!
No flaws in my logic!
its Jake Paul's damn birthday guys!
Oh yeah yeah

The most perfect and kind "Diss track" I've ever seen in my life.

Let’s hope that his one brain cell can comprehend this
Oh no..  asapscience joining the YouTube drama

seriously good work dudes

Jake got schooled by AsapSCIENCE
Great video  dude!! Awesome job explaining! Very easy to understand stand hope Jake Paul can see this video
people who study addiction for a living should try to find a way to allow people to get addicted to something productive. Maybe they can figure out the reward path in the brain that is tailored to a specific individual, then find general associations that are found in everyone and then apply it to the work force so that people can get that kick of dopamine when they are focusing on a project that typically numbs the brain and kills motivation
2018 = logan paul
2019 = jake paul
you wasted your time on this video cause im sure jake paul and rice gum cant even  understand the meaning of commen sence. but good video
Compared to the universe how much space do I take up, would I be infinitely 0??
Jake Paul is a big stinky biscuit boy.
ASAP just very kindly and formally dissed Jake Paul. It was so nonchalant. Beautiful.
A very well-made and informative video. Thanks AsapSCIENCE!
Uhm jake Paul took that Denver guys content make vid about dat
I sent the link for this video to that mystery box video. Yeesh, Logan and Paul has too much dopamine and got out of hand with the risks.
*sips boiling hot tea*
Waiting for JaackMaate
who disliked this it's literally science the 1.1k of jake paulers who watched this don't like science what's good internet
Can we strap Jake Paul down and force him to watch a marathon of ASAP Science like they do in Clockwork Orange so he has a chance to grow a few brain cells.
I think the sims should be listed under substance abuse category
After this video,i hope that your channel gets more exposure so people with little education can get more educated. Keep going on with this video💛
Oooo I love when one of my favorite channels calls out my most hated channel
Im glad you are making a video about this
Jake Paul and science don't really mix well but here we are
we are Jake pauler !!!!
unproblematic dads 💕
Not on trending, but it is on recommended, so it's a start.

Also, interesting that things tagged jake paul still get on recommended, but anything tagged with Pewdiepie just vanishes from any recommended page.
Ricegum,
The only Asian that needs a calculator
They don't care of their own audience. They just think about money, what can we expect?
Jake and Rice probably own mystery brand
ASAPSCIENCE is like the responsible mom of YouTube that, like, protects everyone and actually has their sht together. Hats off to you to calling him out 👏👏
Breaking news: Jake Paul and Ricegum are garbage human beings.




Wait, did I say breaking news? I meant common sense.
So YouTube will take down creator's videos even though they're fair use, but they won't take down these gambling videos that can harm a large majority of the youth?
Damn Jake Paul you really messed up when ASAP Science calls you at :O
You just dissed Jake, Ricegum and Youtube itself. And all with science!
Science and analysis is hands-down the ultimate weapon in destroying anything
This is going to be such a popular video 😂
Well said, my man. Well said.
Age 17: North Korea
Isn't the site basically skinhub
Mystery Box isn’t gambling tho, you are buying a product not win it all or lose it all.
You know it's bad when ASAP  Science comes for Jake Paul.
Your video make me cry because im scared about getting an addiction
thank you for making this
He tried 5 to mess the Maximilianmus army
Dear Jake Paul,
Get some help.
Love this!!
YouTube is still going to keep his channel up, no matter how much we protest.
I was thinking that mystery brand is like the mistery box of Vsauce. 
Wrong.
Vsause does not addvertise to kids. The prises are educational.
I read the title as “Gamblinforkidsg
Finally a professional talking about this subject. We really needed this video
You thought KSI vs Logan and Deji vs Jake was epic?

Vsauce vs Logan
ASAP science vs Jake
i dont think jake understood everything you said
THIS IS THE SICKEST ROAST EVER! ROAST JAKE PAUL WITH SCIENCE! GENIUS!
Was this just a brand deal for mystery box??
Killua has left the chat.






you won’t understand this if you haven’t watched hunter x hunter-
wOw can you believe how calmly and politely he DISSED them?!
You think jake paul is even humble enough to even watch 10s of this vid?
JAKE PAUL



oh yeah yeah
Oh no.

At least they’re bringing this issue to more people.
I think these chemicals are not working in my brain.  I've been in a casino like 7 times with friends that love to gamble And I've tried to get the satisfaction but I don't get it ! It's so strange I don't get it why would you play to lose more than to win
This should be a "dear YouTube" video. They are responsible for keeping Jake Paul in line!
This is the most factual and eloquent diss in history
I bet those Mystery Boxes are selling like a God Church
Imagine if Jake actually listened to this.
Dam when Jake Paul got that iPhone XS he had like a Triple chin.
Gambling is shi* and is for weak people.
Go and find some proper hobbies people, that will actually improve your different skills and will allow you to meet new people and give you new experiences.
Jake: has left the chat
It's pretty difficult to someone to care or even understand brain damage when they themselves don't have one...
I love that they watched him do this and was so bothered by it that he made a video about it, but still so nice and respectfully
They’re not gonna watch this lol it’s too slow and they have ADD they’ll click away within 5 seconds this won’t get past their skulls
How dare you make a video about jake paul we don't want him to get popular again
Well hope has feild humanity for the last time :3
Thanks for having the guts to post this
Very well explained.
This is totally unrelated but can you guys please make a video on appetite suppressants (such as Phentermine) and it's effects on your brain. Also the benefits of OMAD/ Intermittent Fasting. Love your videos, this was very educational. ❤
All we need is a mother’s kid to get into gambling & proceed to sue Jake & Cumrice.
Is it good or bad that I don't watch Jake Paul?
amazing job , well done !
This is a typical Canadian take down. Savage
Im addicted





To breathing and blinking
you know the diss is real when science channels get involved
Even if ppl did send this to Jake Paul he probably wouldn’t watch it😂
Addiction is AMAZING. It feels soooo good. Lol jk
Honestly, after the Shane Dawson coverage of Jake Paul, I thought Jake Paul would just straight up delete his youtube channel altogether then I watched this and smh
The arrow in the thumbnail is pointed in the wrong way
The easiest thing in the world for Jake Paul to do is to not watch this video and ignore it while keep making money. 

Given his lack of presence here in the comment section I’m assuming he’s done just that. Just another Youtuber, ASAP Science making another take down video. 

Only thing is that this video is actually rather respectful to him and his audience. 
So regardless if he sees this or not, it can be assumed that Jake is just like the rest of us as humans who will “by default” choose the path of least resistance. Even if that path for him involves “willful ignorance.” 

And we all know that willful ignorance just makes him culpable in all this so...
If Jake Paul feels like being the better man and proving me wrong then, hey! 
Good on you Jake! 
Glad to see you using your influence to make an impact here. If not...
We all know how this story ends... controversy gets the best him... he fades into obscurity... and by then may god rest his soul.
lol your infographis were very hanible-esk
the mildest jake paul video destroyed him the most, well done
Mathologer's burn on Numberphile was previously my favorite burn video. This is my favorite burn video now
Best response yet and prolly forever, those who responded earlier never truly brought out the facts as to why gambling is harmful to kids.
Oh yeah yeah
I'm curious if Rice would make a diss track about this. He probably would, and I'm sure it would be pathetic.
Jake is a smart person and maybe he’ll respect the approach to took to the issue. This is a really good video and even if he does not see it , it’s still very informative for the public. Good job ASAP.
Liked the video until I saw James Charles
Well im addicted to youtube lol (i need a life)
Everyone, Jake Paul is now a form of science.
lovely video- explained everything clearly and straightforward- without any value judgements to boot! Will be checking out more of your videos:)
why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave ?
Alcohol is a recreational drug.
I was watching a random video from the 50s in my recommend and I was wondering why they talked so differently then than they do know could you make a video on it ?
Thank you for being a good human
Jake Paul is bad
Imagine liking jake paul... uegh i could never
no one can beat obamas disses but asap science ya'll are second *applause
o H Y e A h Yeah

Fox News, Trump, and the Paul Brothers. The CURRENT Axis of Evil
ASAPSCIENCE POPPED O F F
1.1 k jake paulers who couldn’t comprehend the video
GAMBLING FOR KIDS HELL YEAH THATS A GOOD IDEA
YouTube needs to just freaking step up and not only call the Pauls  out, but to actually act on their rules. Enforce them.
Jake Paul should get Content Copped
Y’all are screwed when the science part of YouTube calls you out
Yes yes yes! Great job on a video like this!!
YouTube needs to take some strict  measures about this Paul brothers..
This is a great video, thank you
Hi I am AsapSCIENCE an I did the impossible and diss Jake Paul using SCIENCE
USPS deliver this video to Jake Paul.
There should be casino gambling games that have free coins made of cardboard to put into the machine and click ze button because zag button iz zatizdying
This is matpat right? Srry idk pls don’t @ me
All the arguments brought up by you can also be used against all the micro-transactions from video games
More like 

jOke Paul
One word: stop
what about like arcades. like technically isn’t it gambling? like spending your coins to get tickets.
Even if Jake Paul or Ricegum saw this they would probably find a way to take more advantage.
JAKE PAUL DESTROYED WITH FACTS AND LOGIC
My ad was for a slot machine app...good job youtube.
2:30 I thought you guys were American💁🏼‍♀️
That's true, good job!
TIL: dopamine receptors look like doritos.
:D 666k views! 666 describes Jake Paul!
Jake Paul and ricescum are so dense that they probably will not even understand a sentence of this video
This is the most Subtle Diss ever lol
You know it's bad when asap science calls you out
Youtube probably wont listen cause they dont care anyways. They would defend the Pauls to death.
Dear Jake Paul







Please stop (literally everything....just leave......please)
Bruh I love you guys
*Shane told jp that erika was good for him
JAKE:breaks up with erika
Shane tells him to be careful about his content as he has a young audience 
JAKE:promotes a gambling site to his young audience*
mystery band is a scam people
3:38 Confirmed Jake Paul has a double chin.
Sometimes they need to take a cookie...
I don't rhink jake understands the concept of a "brain"
Jake Paul and ricescum probably won't be able to understand this video.

But this is the most polite jake paul diss i’ve ever seen.
that moment when your name is the same as jake paul
As much as I don’t support Jake Paul, it’s not like this is a new issue. Loot box systems exist in video games everywhere that are very heavily targeted to young audiences.
I made jake paul a razzmatazz today
I'm addicted to salt, like actual salt.
This video is gonna really make Paul's one brain cell hurt.
Did jake demonetise this vid ?
didn't even know Jake Paul before  watching this! that's how good I am.
Oh yeah yeah
when i was 13 i as addicted to this machine in a place called leisure plex but i won the best possible reward quite quickly and haven't done it since, guess i'm mature
Awesome all it needs is to have a diss track. And would Youtube listen to you that Jake Paul should be warned or blocked?
When the nerds fight back 👍
Waita jump on the band wagon
ASAPscience DESTROYS Jake Paul in epic diss video
OH YEAH YEAH
You know you messed up when a channel used to educate teenagers calls you out
When did asap science become politics and whatever this is?
;D;
Nothing like turning little kids into gambling addicts, YouTube 2019 guys.
Oh yeah dude so many kids use their own credit card to gamble now yeah dude
Flamedddd!!!!
I am so confused by the percentage math at the end. 63% is not 50 percent more than 48%.
Plz make a vedio on classification of animal!
But they weren’t the only ones who promoted the product, so why is asap science dissing them?🤔
(Btw, I’m not a Jake or rice fan)
This is great and all, but there is one lurking variable you missed;



Jake Paul is so popular, that YT doesn't care.
Maybe in a few years, once he becomes obsolete like Justin Beiber, then he will regret his actions.
Spread the news. Get this to trending
Jake paul and Ricegum has left the chat
Are Fortnite loot crates gambling?
Jake Paul: Watches Video, uploads diss-track on Asapscience
it's a really good video, but sadly i believe that jake paul doesn't give a shit. As long as people keep watching and money keeps coming he'll be fine. Even if your video is really interresting and a good way to underline the real issue of gambling for young people. I'm sure that jake paul does not give a damn about it.
How many times has Jake Paul viewed this??
(oooo)
(oooooo)
Yeah good job lecturing Jake Paul when you and your mate are the ones virtue signaling everybody
This is an amazing Diss track
Ah, the classic "I'm mad, better earn money from it" approach. How's them views working out?

Side note: didn't watch the video cos I don't care about the Pauls, however the people who do sure don't mind the money these scandals make them
I tried gambling once. I bought 5 of those scratcher cards. Just to try it out. They were $5 each. So I spent $25. I won another free scratcher. And $2. I never tried it again. That free scratcher I had, the 2nd card I got from that, turned out it was $10. I used it to buy me breakfast that same day.
Good man forcing Jake to finish what he left at High School
Jake Paul is probably gonna watch this and finally use his 1 braincell to fix his mistake lmao
I got an ad for poker before watching this lol
The ad right under the subscribe button for me is slots smh
i got a gambling ad on this
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOUR LEG FALLS ASLEEP. IM IN SO MUCH PAIN RIGHT NOW
Jake Paul and his brother have been a TOXIC example of the negatives of YouTube fame and I sincerely hope YouTube goes Thanos on them.
GAMBLINFORKIDSG
This is important!!!!!!!
Stop recomanding me this
Appreciate you doing this..... kids and young need to be protected against people such as Jake Paul trying to take advantage of young and generally naive people
Isn't Chuck e cheese gambling then
This is why I love this channel
GAMBLINFOR KIDSG
Their is some similar videos to this on game/film theory the one about how loot boxes are bad and Logan Paul is selling illegal  merchandise
Thank 👏 you 👏 for 👏 pointing 👏 this 👏 out 👏
This line is for Jake and Logan...




STOP IT..... GET SOME HELP...
Can everyone feel the tension at 5:13 as the background music goes up the scale to properly show the REAL intensity of the situation???? 





Cause I can!!!
This started with techrax mystery eBay series I think
Borderlands 2
You are the guy who explains someone something kindly with science ... Thank you greg and mitch .. hope this brings change
I thought this gambling BS ended with CSGO
If this is the case then we really need to do something about loot boxes in video games.
Dear jake Paul I actually forgot  you existed until this moment
Oh snap, asapscience dropped their disstrack 🔥
@RewiredSoul you have got to talk about this video!
I don't follow Jake Paul nor have I heard of this site before but one website that I look at occasionally is HumbleBundle.
So far, I didn't go for the monthly pack, only dropping money when something I like came up for sale there.
My point is, isn't it up to the responsibility of each user to control their spending?
I play mobile gacha games ( summoners war and epic 7 ) and follow youtubers that spend a lot on the in-game packs.
I wouldn't go as far as to blame them for my spending if I ever do spend though.

Jeez, how dumb can these kids be if they have to go to "gambling" for their dopamine fix? The internet is so vast, you can find anything else to fill up your time.
That's how science works
Dear Jake Paul,
Gtfo
YOUTUBE SHOULD BAN THEM.
Have you watched nerdcity's video on jake? The dude literally made a video for investors about exploiting young audiences
you know that you are uploading trash when a channel about science(one that does not really get into youtube conflicts) gets into the action
And no one is talking about the arcade machines...
Jake Paul gets dragged by science
This was so well put and kind unlike other ‘call out’ videos
I used to gamble on csgo I got lucky I was able to pull out nice and easy and I lost lots of money but made 90percent of it back
He won't care, he's a sociopath. He  is completely indifferent.
such an eloquent take down - i love it
“GamblinForKidsg”
Love this!!! Well done
Jake Paul needs help...
AYYY AsapSCIENCE taking shots ;)
Im 14 and I can feel that i can gamble resposnebly
When I created my google account I said was 18 so I get beer ads lmao I am 12 btw
If it's too good to be true. It is.
Same thing with chuck e cheese
i agree with your video, but i think maybe an opinionated video should stay off of a science channel
Half way through this video I forgot this was about Jake Paul
I thought this will be another video about drama episodes, I was wrong. This is informative, well made and with a necessary message.
Ooh yeah yeah
csgo flashbacks I lost so much money ughh I was so stupiddd
So does this Apply to Ricegum aswell
And now I see why gambling is haram
Now thats what I call ScIenCE!
Why did u use such an old pic of James Charles??
I am glad not to be one of those 63% of people
AsapSCIENCE is the one who most makes the most polite roast videos on youtube




does that even make sense?
I love you. My guy
This channels honor level has increased
Thank goodness I am not subscribed to those channels.
Very informative:)
Jake paul proves that when a sperm meets an ovum doesn't mean it can create a perfect human
you know its bad when my nerd channels are talking about jake paul
Islam banned gambling 1400 yrs ago
You honestly expect that window-licker to even comprehend what's going on in the cartoon diagrams?
Great to see a little Science added onto this whole drama topic whatever you call it.
Good effort but I'm 100% convinced it's in vain. JP and Ricegum could not care less about what they're doing or the consequences. They won't even look at this video
oh yeah yeah send reinforcements
Lmao I got an add for a gambling website under this video
Now you know Jake Paul is screwing up if ASAPscience of all people is getting into this
I got an ad for poker before this video
Let’s be honest... if a kid is actually going to listen to jake Paul, it’s just natural selection at that point. Call me harsh, but in this doomed day and age, only the best should prevail
ASAPScience joins the battle
Never expected that
Your a bit late
Fortnite aswell ?? With buying skins
Top ten scientists Jake Paul was to afraid to diss.
You may now also becoming a leftwing channel in some cases but this is a good video from you, and being a while since you were unbiased or simply trying to be educational.
I lost $5000 of my parents’ money many years ago because I was addicted to gambling on csgo gambling websites... I was only 14 years old
so opening cases in csgo is gambling? Lel
Sorry you misspelled the tittle. Its actually Deer Jake Paul aka Mr. Incredible look alike
Were those Doritos?
And people think Jake actually cares. Lol.
I agree with the video, but the channel is about Science so why are you talking about this?
love this who else remembers cs lotto?? ( i lost 3 g :(. ) it feels like that “ first time” meme
cocaine addiction ruined my 2018 year..man thank god im clean now
Might this also be a subtle way of saying Jake Paul has a coke addiction? :O
I doubt Jake or Ricegum have the mental capacity or patience to listen pass the 20 second mark
When your get dissed by a science channel
If they get sponsored by mystery brand they will get a link to get a specific price. I bet you can't find a sponsored vid with the url
Who would fall for that anyway lmao
Why are there more than 400 dislikes.....I seriously don’t get it
I love this channel because the creators are not afraid to speak up on what they believe is wrong plus y’all science videos are so amazing!’n
Does this mean I should stop opening pokemon card
You're correct but that individual simply does not care, he will continue to do it until he is bared from doing
Good point. never expected a video like this would appear from this channel 😅
If you play poker but don't bet money, can that be addictive?
Zane hijazi did the same thing
Lets tweet this video to jake
This guy doesn’t sound aggressive at all.This is what a calling out video needs to be like.Preach
Oxygen so you can breath, Florine for your pretty teeth!
Does anyone know if Jake has seen this yet?
I got a poker ad before this lol
Mitch, you are literally such a source of inspiration and light into an often cold, starkly dark world. You inspire me to be me, be my best, and be true in anything I do. Thank you good sir :) love from North America :D
How about Xtreme games?!?!?!?!?!
He's a sociopath so he wouldn't care anyway
You very right
It's not gambling it's just spending money in hopes of getting something worth more
Jake paul is slowly and surely becoming irrelevant, just let his career die off if you dislike him or what he does...
"ricecum"
ASAP science is Petty at the end love it.
YEAH, SCIENCE!!
1:03 me + doritos 😋
Jake Paul was born on the same day as me.. I already didn't like my birthday but now I feel sad on that day.
You expect a man like him understand all of this?
Hey Guys could you make a video about the wim hof breathing tecnique?
I think you need to dumb down your video because of Jake Paul fans watching this
This is how you should diss someone.
Destroyed with science
Yeah Now Did You Understand Jake Paul..?
Do a video on lie detector stuff
This is the best diss video I have seen
I got a mafia city ad lol
I adore that you care so much, you guys <3 you are what's right with the world
i dont think this is a science video
Dear Internet Citizen, please stop making stupid people famous including Jake
Oh yeah yeah
A good show that uses this as a metaphor and main theme for the dangers of gambling addiction is Kakegurui: compulsive gamblers. Good show, even though it doesn't blatantly tell you that gambling is bad, and in some cases it shows you that gambling is fun at sometimes, but the overall message is about the dangers of gambling.
I think Jake is too dumb to understand anything in this vid
Lol reminds me of FIFA packs
There are YouTube stars who are/were TV stars, so what is the impact for THOSE?
Great video, the point is that Jake Paul is an idiot, who seconds?
Christ you know YouTube the bad one science channels are  talking about controversies
You know somethings up when AsapScience drops a video on you...
I DRANK SO MUCH COFFEE!!!
Can you please cover gaming addiction as well?
I've been playing League of Legends for so many years, and even tho most of the time I don't enjoy it and I am nervous the whole time I am playing it, I still can't stop playing it.
Jake Paul is on my list of top 10 hated people.
When you've got to stop missing science class
Send this to jake for little education
This, this is a Canadian diss video.
...sponsored by Mystery Brand
Jake fall takes another L
Can I get addicted to playing the harmonica
I hate that the Paul Brothers keep doing stuff like this and face no repercussions from it aside from a few people getting mad at them for a little while. The day will come when they do something extremely bad and it will maybe finally put them in their place. God knows they need it because anyone that's looking up to these people as role models really need to look elsewhere. These guys are not something anyone should aspire to be.
Shawn Dawson Documentary Series 2.0
But better.
Can someone clear the science up a bit, im slightly confused regarding the dopamine receptors. From what i read and learned, dopamine receptors down-regulate when exposed to high dopamine levels over time, this results in less dopamine binding to receptors etc. In this video he says dopamine receptors upregulate? Can someone explain please?
Wow, I wasn’t expecting this
I love your channel helps me with school actually more than my teacher
Dear  *sociopath
I got a poker ad for this
Now this type of "expose" videos I can watch whole day
Maybe a why do we blink video?
YouTube is pretty wack when it comes to enforcing their community guidelines
ASAP Science making disses
Thank you for calling out shitty people like this. Please continue so we can come to a time on social media where people are ALWAYS called out for their actions and are required to have some dignity. Especially when they are influencing so many.
666k views
As a kid I was addicted to webkinz, I still think abut it sometimes
never expected you guys to make a video about jake paul
Great next we will find out that they both own the site #csgolotto2
They changed their name for « Skinhub », just so you know
That neurotic pos won't change , kill em off.
Doing God's work my friends
Honestly, jake paul doesn't give a f*ck, he got paid a few hundred grand just to make that video and keep it up
when you get called out by asap science
@gameswithlootboxes
Yeah your right ...
Oh yeah yeah
Persuasive, good mannered, and very smart material.
January Paul Drama(tm)
Even if he's able to understand this, I'll bet the gibbon won't care anyway.
I don’t think Jake has the brain capacity to process this.
This needed to be done
I wonder what the lyrics would be if this was turned into a diss track?😁
I appreciate the thought and reason for the video, but we all need to realize that this is for jake Paul, ...jake Paul... I think we can safely assume that he doesn’t know/ care about any of the consequences or repercussions , the only way he’ll stop is if he doesn’t have a channel 
YouTube keeps giving irresponsible people too much responsibility and acting surprised when the same irresponsible people do stupid things
In every sentence in this video, 50 percent of the words in those will be words jake cannot understand. And I realize that my grammar is bad I am tired
OMG! CAN YOU GUYS DO A PROTEIN SYNTHESIS SONG PLEASSSE!!!
Sadly Jake Paul will never understand this because of his nearly-dead single brain cell.
Oh yeah yeah
GAMBILINforkidsG
I have rules about my kid watching  creators like that.  They do love you guys.
When I gamble, I get really nervous for some reason.
best diss track
They’re probably gonna respond with “If you don’t like it, don’t buy it”
It's the youtube algorithm lmao
Yup that's true because of some "content creators" on Youtube I've gamble a couple of times and i'm 14
Great job !
I don’t think Logan will understand all those BIG words
Is this channel tryna use ppls name for clout
How come the drugs look like Doritos 0:55
Even when an education channel is roasting you know you have hit a low
Dear jake paul....




No U
oh yeah yeah our army supports the fight against jake paul
This one of the YouTube channels that is  actually aware of things like addiction in childern. Good side of YouTube.
I can’t gampble. I prohibit myself. The little experiences i’ve had with it have been adictive. A few hears back, my family (great-grandparents) lost everything, including their only income, their has station, to gambling. My whole family would’ve been rich if it wasn’t for that.
Jake Paul likes to play the fool when it suits. If you watch videos of him addressing other adults in his line of business, he is different- shrewd, calculating, manipulative. 
This can be seen in NerdCity's videos after the Shane Dawson series- the clips show a very different tone and completely different language. When addressing kids, Shane Dawson etc he acts oblivious, shocked anyone would think he is a cunning businessman etc...when addressing a room full of business  people and advertisers it is a whole different act, he suddenly knows all about how to push kids to do things and drive sales and revenue using his content. Weird.
I thought this was an MKBHD video
Who else loves asapscience
He won't listen as long as he gets paid.
In short





Ban paul bros 🚫
Send this to ricegum too
This is a great video,but Jake’s attention span is way to short to get through this entire video, nor will he understand most of it.
You can also show this video to EA
What about LOGAN PAUL
Dont worry lets wait and he will die be age.
Gotta love how YouTube doesn't apply rules to their chosen creators. Showing videos of a dead body, marketing gambling to minors. Hypocrites who demonitize news channels who cover difficult topics but are fine with the exploitation of the mentally ill and children.
brazil has felipe neto
Well explained
This is a nice video, but this happens to much, a change of content is nice but a change of purpose is vice versa, no matter how much the comments beg you please don’t switch full time
HERE FOR THE TEAAAAAA
Halogens and alkaline react aggressively
I was the 1million viewer
At first, I thought it was scummy. Now, their just dirt bags. Thanks for this enlightening video.
elegant and classy but it's still a total diss
Rice gum? More like FLEX gum.
I like how this video was calm and collected in it’s delivery. So many people think that the best way to get someone to change is the bash them and yell at them when that literally never works. I’m glad that ASAP science knows the proper way to address issues, and imo, it gives you guys so much more credibility. Thanks for being awesome guys!
"Dear Jake Paul" my senses tell me i must click
GamblinForKidsg
Thank you Asap.
I'm not addicted to drugs because i cant afford it.
This has so much class
Ricegum? More like Ricescum. I'll see myself out now, sorry. :p
i love asap even more now
Hit like for Asapscience
Reply for Jake Paul
Let's see who wins ✌️
Oh these are facts facts
I'm a teen but I will never get addicted to gambling because there's a chance of failure.
Which is why if you gamble use your game sense
What if we used 0% of our brain
Im adicted to YouTube
Great job guys
5:12 slight ominous music
TEA SJSKKSSKSKSKKSKSKKSS
Jake and Logan are whats wrong with society
Coinmaster??
You know it's serious when this channel has to intervene
This video is still to complicated for Jake to understand
Can you make a video about how drinking alcohol as a teen changes you? so like what it does to your brain (also in the long term) and the risks...
watch out Jake Paul coming out with a disstrack on you soon
4:10 csgo gambling intensify
Hmmm this seems VERY similar to csgo gambling youtuber mess
I would pay my entire life saving to stop Jake Paul
I love this 🤓
wanna know why Jake Paul did this? 




because he got paid 100k
#roasted OOF
didn’t know who jake paul was. but deff gotta start watching his vids now. he looks lit lol
oh yea yea, I forgot about this channel
Jake paul be like: Lol, love this vid <3
jake politics
*a diss track is eminent
As an addict this makes me very happy
CSGO Lotto in real life...
I like how polite this diss is, and then at the end of the video you just throw jp's video to garbage can
A channel with biased political undertones in their "scientific" videos is dissing on another channel for not being ethical. Gimme a break.
England is still my city
If ASAP science has to make a video on u it’s probably time to make some changes
0:16 voice crack
so this is like the any number of cs go gambling sites we had back in the day?
Best crossover event in history.
3:38 this is why i don’t watch jake Paul lol
anyone else tried to remove those black spots around play button while watching the videos? 2:44
Best roast ever
Why the hell do asap science need to talk about this
And my mom still say im a gaming addict
Why are you watching this, why am I watching this? We aren't Jake Paul, let's go watch Jarvis Johnson!
Good on you ASAP
Thank you so much
Plot Twist: This video is a mystery brand paid advertisement
All you had to say was you shouldn’t teach kids to gamble ;-;
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah
Mysterybrand is literally just a ghetto skinhub
A jake paul video on a science channel...
I like that you emphasized how encouraging kids to gamble is different than gambling, or even encouraging adults to.
Can't wait to see what BS RiceCunt will come up with to counterargue this video.
Out of anyone in existence who could possibly call out Jake Paul’s tomefferry, it’s this madlad.
They don't care. Honestly. It's sad but it's true
I hope this goes trending so that more people can know about it
Very well said
Youre still watching that phagott jeez
Does that count for unboxing crates?
wow asap taking a jab at Jake Paul...
Why is asap science a sjw channel now

Sure you have way more money now but that’s just not cool
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah
Don't think Jake Paul is capable of comprehending this
Thanks dude
Jake Paul
Logan Paul
And Asian jake Paul

Wish they never got popular
I think it would be a lot better if when you buy the box you are guaranteed something that is at least the price you paid for the box, but you have the potential to win something worth a lot more. So if you paid 200 you could inevitably get something worth at least 200 but it could be work 400 600 etc.
1:56 Mr. blue shirt is a billionaire!!!
Stay in your lane
THATS HOW MAFIA WORKS
Jake Paul and the like, will mould the world of tomorrow.
Well done.
At first when you were explaining what Mystery Brand was, I thought it was a brand deal.
Big chungus is going to assinate Jake paul on January 21 2019 at 3:00pm
People are making jokes about Jake paul not having brain cells when it couldnt be further from the truth. Jake is smart, knows what hes doing, and doesnt care. Not having a conscience is a lot different from not having brain cells.
They had Emma and James(in the pictures) so they should have put Ethan and Grayson in to complete the sister squad
Lol my mom bought me scratcher rn at a gas station
What about COD supply drops
Sips Tea
Oh yeah yeah
but no one is talking about chucky cheese 👀
Oh yeah yeah
This is the most peaceful jake paul diss ever.
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
CS:GO lotto 2.0
Outstanding move
When I saw Shane Dawson’s series he made me feel bad for Jake.  But now I am back to knowing that he is irresponsible and shouldn’t be on YouTube with such a young audience.
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
so called out ,but with science
Did they have to post this on this channel? Isn't the channel name literally Asap*SCIENCE?*
ASAP SNAPPED
Jake paul and Ricescum are idiots
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!!
Inside the mind of Jake Paul: Gambling edition
Well done.
I like how they target Jake since hes more hated but they act like ricegum did nothing when he did the same thing LOL! This should be named "Dear Snake Paul and RiceDumb" 😂
God i hate these money craving, child abusing "celebs", someone ought to lock em up or something.
How is this asap science???? America explain
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. ¤
Oh yeah yeah
Next on Drama Alert- ASAP science vs Jake Paul boxing match. Coming september 2019
Don't be rude the day after you post this is his b day
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
People like Jake Paul are famous and Donald Trump is still president....What a great time to be alive.
I really wonder if he watched this
Oh yeah yeah
Love how even the science channels are getting in it to raise awareness 😍
Oh Yeah Yeah
@ASAPscience It was a farking Brand Deal and Your only blaming Jake Paul because of his past. Rice Also did it but you aren’t blaming him as much as JP
Maybe you aren’t as smart as people think you are.
Oh yeah yeah
best diss ever
that dum dum won't understand
Oh yeh yeh this is so nice
Look, I hate Jake with a passion,  but so many other YouTubers did this before him and rice and nobody got called out
@youtube wyd?
Ban Jake Paul
Appreciate it!
You know its bad when asap science has to address the issue
Jake Paul must have lost so many brain cells so can we please hold him down and force him to watch a crap ton of ASAP science so he can develop a few back

please

thanks :)
to bad this will never hit trending
And of course YouTube will do nothing cause m o n e y
Is Jake Paul watching this?
How do I hide or block this channel?
Guess jake paul never grew up
Dude,youtube is addicted to that sweet sweet jack paul youtube money,they ain't goona  stop it any soon
Because science?
You know sht gets real when a science show talks about a fame wh*re-wanna be-artist/youtuber
Oh yeah yeah
When a science channel that pretty much never gets in YouTube controversy gets in YouTube controversy, you know you are screwed.
Bless you
Do you guys may wanna pet him a bit?  Because you speak like he does something a bit wusibusi-ish, "not that we would not like you...  please be our friend, but  you... could - or could not, do way you feel you want to do today!:) 
- not promote so much  gambling -ISH... thingibingis  on your channel. But hey, no offence here, we could also do a  promo together and than say in the last 2 sec. After the last advertisement,  that  its basically nothing  for your hole  audience-ish.
Like authorities  who wanna have the option to say:" Isaid something-ISH" 
And wanna have the controversy views/money
AsapSCIENCE are THE best of braking down a problem and giving moderate reasons on how to solve it too
Oh yeah yeah
Melting Lipsticks is not an experiment...
Guava Juice 🥤?
just spits fax
Get Jake Paul to see this. Please.
oh no no
He doesn't owe you or anyone anything
I don't understand gambling I find it quite boring really can someone explain why this might be
Paul surely is a cocaine addict
GET SCIENCED BINCH
G A M B L I N for kids G
I saw a bird today
Polite diss track
I’m dead even asap science is stepping in
Jake Paul sucks
Can you start doing science videos again?
Well done guys 😊 I hope he sees this. But also, I hope he hasn’t spent the money he has earned from that jack-o website and can give it back because taking down the video would be a breach of contract.
Wait,Jake Pauls channel is still running?
Haha, JakeTard isn’t slipping this one under the rug! I’d love to see him and his cuckwad brother run out of youtube!
Even ASAP SCIENCE is calling them out
Next you wanna call out fortnite, cod black out, pubg or other loot box based gambling games?
But his teachers never taught him that! Kind of disappointing I know this reference XD
Love you guys so much <3
Great video! You didn't attack him and actually taught him / and the other youtubers doing this WHY its wrong and the science behind it. Jake can't really watch this and argue he is still in the right.
ASAP stick to scince
Damn, this was a really good video, and for a good cause, thanks guys.
Way to hop on a bandwagon
cut to Shane Dawson making a 10 part series explaining and giving excuses for JP
I like how they actually used a scientific explanation instead of stating random arguements like most people would do. Educate yourself people.
i got a casino add
youtube sometimes really doesnt care about the guidelines, i dont think anything will happend to them
Maybe they should take down their whole channel instead? The world is a better place without them
Gotta milk the trend
this video is sponsored by mystery brand
2:00 where's the lever hole?
I'm glad you guys are making Jake aware of the impact he has on these young kids. 👏👏
I am addicted to YouTube
Wait is this a sponsored video
Didnt expect this
0:04 ricecum
Now that he has the information lets see what he does with it
This ain't science chief
Please do a video on the Keto Diet
all the teaaaaa
It's the same as the tmartin scandal....
Your a bit late
when you don't understand that its fake and most if not all people under 12 don't even like jake
why is a science channel talking about drama?
What a cool experiment
I'm sorry but if you're attempting to talk to Jake Paul you'll need to be a lot more direct and use words he can understand.
Even you made a video WTF
5:03 oh that face
Where my Jakepauler army at?
He doesn’t care, he is a sociopath
forgot he existed.....
Oh yeah yeah ricegum is trash clickbait hype youtubers
Huh I have a genetic disposition to addiction.
I love you
The thing is, YouTube’s never going to take action against people like the Paul’s because they are so big and they only do take action when we as the YouTube community force them to!
I thought this was a science channel?
what about T-series
You know its serious when asap science  comes into it
Dear Asian Jake Paul.
Are the same effects of gambling addiction present with the addiction to video games or the internet?
I just wish the "Bird Box" thing cud make a visit to Jake and Logan pauls houses
Here we go again
Well least it wasn't 2018
Etiquette dissing
Mic Drop
👌🏽👌🏽
Trying to be a  part in a drama are we?
jake does every bad thing on purpose because of the youtube algerrythm, people will make videos like these wich would then boost his views on his videos anf jake pauls channle
It’s time to STOP!
Remember when this was a science channel
The 990 dislikes are edgy 12 years old
This should be addressed to video game companies too. They’ve been teaching kids how to gamble for years now.
This is why asapscience is my favourite channel. Safe for my brain development, probably is making me smarter and they don't tell me to go to some weird gambling site.
He won't listen. He probably won't understand. Everyone should know that the man is an idiot.
Get Educated Son
It’s not even a gambling website, it’s a lying gambling website. If you recreate one of their crates with the same odds and prizes, the price of the crate is about 15 times more expensive so with the price they give divide the alleged chances by 15.
Dear ASAP Science, while I don't disagree with this video, you often talk about social/political issues and intentionally use faulty studies but claim it as science. If anyone wants to become woke, reply and I'll give all the video names that contain faulty information.
How many cigarettes would it take to pollute the world??
A factual problem...the receptors gets downregulated that is there number goes down
ASAP don’t lower ur self to titles for views keep it science oriented thank you
I guess this is science...
How does one manage to diss so respectfully? damnnn...
This video is pointless, Jake Paul isn’t smart enough to even understand this video
* cough csgo magic
Peoples fault
risecums?
straight up shots
Do you think this is another Tmartin thing?
Karen took my money
You know things got serious when a science channel has to call you out for promoting gambling to children
I just can't fathom why people like his content, especially growing teenagers and young adults.
CSGO did this but better
Oh yeah yesh
Great work
the only time I’m cool with someone snitching
youtube really needs to crack down actual policy violators instead of prioritizing gaining money
If you trust YouTube content creators as guidance for your life, you should deserve to be exploited..
What did you do to ke Jake?
Well then.
When asap science has to diss you.... you know you screwed up, big time. And I did not even know website existed until now.
Hope he fades out fast .  Or crashes his car
He's not gonna stop, they're paying him to make these videos
hmmmmm Jake Paul is an alien
Okily dokily
Didn’t even put rice gum in title...
That shows how irrelevant he is lmao
All this video does is give him publicity. Jake Paul and the company sponsoring him definitely knows about the effects of gambling on minors, that's probably why this is a thing in the first place.
I just wanna say that you guys are awesome. Keep doing what you do. God bless
Some of the truest words ever spoken right there. Addiction IS awful!!
0:03 "You and RiceCum" did I hear it right? you forgot the S, RiceScum*
GET ‘EM ASAP!!!
Cancel Jake Paul
Scumbag lmao
This is what happens when Canadians get infuriated
I've never tried drugs
I have an addiction of meditation. I would meditate whole day doing nothing more
Mental health problem = Jake and Logan Paul
Jake Paul it's manure and the cancer of youtube
He said addictions are bad
I have an addiction to stuffed animals
AsapNotScience
Stick to science
That roast at the end tho..
So less dislikes wow
He can’t just take down a vid that a company paid him to do
lol they don't care.
You-tubers do have a big influence. Connor Franta encouraged me to come out.
ASAP is a diss Chanel now
Seems like you're trying to get views by targeting hate that Jake Paul gets.
No stop please this is not science
Bravo!
Strongest diss ever
Wow sounds just like lootboxes in videogames.
Where’s the science
1:39 wow it really looks like you !
Mic drop
Gamblin For Kids g
What about fortnite
Is it me or this video just made me wanna go to the website even more?
YESSSS.
I tried it (I’m stooopid) all I got were vans
OMG!! You opened my eyes.. Although I had no idea who Jake Paul was or that mystery box stuff either.
Right after I clicked away to start the next video, a guy in an advertisement video tried to get me to click to watch his 4 part series to be a YouTube star. WOW! True testament to your video on how our devices "watch" us.
Someone needs to sue them for promoting gambling to kids.
Good job
Dear Ryan strike them for using your style. Just kidding asap science you guys are awesome!!! 👍😊😘😍👌👌
dear AsapSCIENCE. stick with being a subpar animation studio for stoners, not a moral guidance Chanel. not a bad video, just weird and random
disliking cuz jake paul is in the title
you did this for views, sellout
At first, I was surprised you made a video about Jake Paul.
First
1.5k dislikes came from 3 year olds who came from jake paul
I thought this is a science channel tho.
#youtubearehypocrits
Nice video bro keep it up
Its serious when you guys make a video about it
If jake paul or asian jake paul deleted their channel the world would be a better place
It's nice that you didn't ramble off on the guy like most do.  I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it, but I feel that it's nice that you actually tried to inform rather than yell at.  Angry rants about who did what get unappealing after a while.
you’re a little late
No wonder Disney fired him
Funny before the oil age a lot of this would get sorted on its own
WOW!!
LOL NICE
Goes to comments to see if jake commented
exposed
Mad facts
If you define an addiction as anything that produces dopamine in the brain and makes you want more, then literally anything that makes you happy is an addiction. Socializing, reading, singing, drawing, sports… I’m not saying gambling is good but this video leaves me with questions
Neat
jake pool
<3
oh yeahhhhhhhh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
Science
You think the Paul brothers have morals, practice ethics, and are capable of deep self-reflection. That's cute.

You might as well be asking a fish to climb a tree.
stop
One thing that really needs to be focused on is the toys that our being marketed our kids in these days. Very many large amounts of toys are advertised as mystery box items for a chance at a rare cool thing inside, its teaching our children at a young age to gamble which will greatly affect our society later on. These kinds of toys need to be regulated or removed entirely, it's extremely negative for our society and is only going to make things for many families worse.
Here’s a video idea!!! Explain the psychological addiction to power that the human race is plagued with. Why are we plagued with an addiction to feel above someone else? Maybe too intricate for a video but idk I’m onto something here.
All the dislikes are 11 year old Jake Paul fans
Top ten rappers Eminem was scared to diss
Do you think Jake Paul actually cares? Is this gonna change anything.
What’s sad is the fact that Jake Paul probably doesn’t care about any of the facts behind gambling and prioritizes money above everything
Lemme tell you what. Do you think Jake Paul doesn't know that gambling is bad? Of course he knows. Knowing exactly how bad things are won't change him. HE DOESN'T CARE! He's a person who cares more about getting money than the well-being of his fans.
Man even science channels are making fun of this bozo now
3:54 suomi mainittu torilla tavataan
Watch out hes gonna copy claim you
I love drugs
O no
Pewdiepie drank whiskey on his channel... And his audience are 9 - 14 year olds...
Thank you
Please do a video on CBD✌
Jake Paul sees video: So.... you’re saying.... I NEED THEM TO GET ADDICTED TO MY CHANNEL!
.....I don't really care about those 2 so...
Its jake, yt wont give him a community guide lines strike because hes there "special" little baby.
Oh no no
Who dis
When you realize Pewdiepie is a huge influence
It doesn’t matter. Kids will still continue to support him and YouTube won’t do anything about it. So, he ends up still winning..
I just want to say is that jake and rice are getting targeted but that I think the first person to use this website is tal fish man and why is he not getting targeted
But he’s a sociopath so he only cares about what’s in it for him and doesn’t care about hurting others.
What? They are really doing this? In Europe, you would directly go to prison for having created such a website...
It's not rice gum it's rice gumbi
Very nice video, unfortunately jake doesn't care cause he just cares about the money
Oh yeah
Where is the FTC? Where is the attorney general??
Im addicted to microtransactions....


Anyone want a league of legends account?
dopamine fein gang
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Very Cool AsapScience!, Very Nice!
jake paul is big doo doo head
I’m 9 years old, tats why I don’t do stuff crazy, I watch memes
ASAP SCIENCE  REALLY WENT OFF
Irrelevant
bruh mystery brand is sus af smh
Why am i. Here i hate jake paul
Nobody’s making the kids get on the site tf
I'm looking for hate comments from the fans of jake
Haha gott ‘em!
Wow! People would just trick you like that? That's not good!
Great PSA.
Not first 😭 ya are fast
Yeet
🙌🙌🙌
Many other "quality" youtubers advocated lootbox or lootcrate or whatever it's called, supposedly with high quality gaming/comic/nerdstuff merchandise, except when youtubers open it there are 30$+ figurines and t-shirts in it, and when you open it there's some "luke I'm you're father" sticker and smelly old call of duty lollipops from last e3 in it. That's gambling plus false advetisement. At least jp and rg showed the possibility of loosing. The only differnce to loot-whatever is higher stakes but gambling is gambling. And all youtubers have kids watching.
oof
Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical of you to call somebody out that promotes something addictive to young children?
jake paul, tana mongeau, and ricescum all need their channels deleted. they are literally ruining children
You know you’re not changing anyone’s mind about this? The lines are already drawn and their is nothing anyone can do to stop what’s happening
Jake Paul is a cancer that needs to be deleted.
Next LOGAN PAUL
Jake will not be stupid enough to understand this. He’ll be stupid enough to be sociopathic and not care because he cares about no one but himself.
Roasted
Canadian insults
I know I’m late but please don’t tell me that Jake is gonna make a diss track on this channel.
I see your point but they can't help that kids ruin youtube for the rest of us. they have the YouTube Kids app why dont they stay on that instead.
Where’s the second part of this diss?
Why aren’t you call out other youtubers??? There is tens of them big you tubers who did the same thing
It's like there's a whole brave new world of stupidity out there, and I just learned of its existence through this video.
just go to the arcade kids
I’m so happy my 7 year old brother is swedish and can’t understand what they are saying.
* clap * * clap * jake paul did an oopsie
3:18 infant gambler
Oh man
Ricegum was right tho.  There were dozens of other huge controversy-free youtubers who have promoted this who have extremely young audiences.   Not an excuse but no1 is going after them
I wonder how Google will respond.
Please stay out of drama, you’re a science  channel
How does game addiction compare to drug addiction
Jake Paul and Ricegum:Play this stupid website that I play for no reason that is addictive!
YouTube:DEMONETIZED!!!!!!
You can’t just call out Jake Paul and Ricegum because csgo gambling cites have been doing this for years listen I dont like those two but to be fair there not the only yters to do this who have young followers
I wouldn’t trust these sites
Honestly I Don’t Care how much money they make, Youtube will fall if these Youtubers still exist. Eliminate them for their many sins.
Jake Paul is cray cray 😜
Didn't two big youtubers like... last year face HUGE legal issues for this same thing? And I know they were part/co-owners of the site, but let's be real here- would ANY of y'all be shocked if the same thing came out here?
For those who don't know some of the boxes would have to be sold at $25,000 per box to make money at the percents that they are labeled at and the box is being sold at $19 so the website is 100% a scam
4 year olds: Mom can I borrow your purse real quick?







you’re adopted
You redeemed yourself from the science of racism video.
Rice gum needs to go back to China like he got no talent. Go back to doing what you’re best at, eating cats and dogs
Dear ASAP science. No kids care about sponsorship of a video. I am a kid and I relate to this.
Tea
6 views and 600 likes, YouTube are you drunk again
I don't care about drama on YouTube anymore I just wanted to watch this because I'm bored
@JakePaul ha
Bruno.
Love your videos. please do a video on how ink poisoning works and if drawing on your hands causes it
This is why I've always thought gambling shouldn't be advertised to anyone. I personally think they should be advertised as a bad thing like smoking and drinking is, same with the lottery.
Rice Scum
Daaaaaammmnn
Who cares. Why are you focused on "controversial" "YouTubers" (that normal people have NEVER HEARD OF ) when you're supposed to teach science
Ya the whole mystery brand thing is super sus
Can you even get the actual items from that site? How do they mail me a icicle? How do they get me a Lamborghini? How do they get that million dollar house? Doesn't make sense.
Tmartn Part 2?!
you ruined the video we you suggested a solution
Yeahh nice diss
This is just ridiculous. Youtube has gone out of control lately. I'm just thinking that this Mystery Brand website is owned or co owned by Jake Paul and rice gum like what happened in TmarTn2's case. Just my guess
9 to 12 year olds should somehow be banned from YouTube 😂
YouTube will never do anything,  they just don't care. It's just a lie to make parents feel better about letting their kids on the app.
Uh oh.
didn’t expect to see this from asapscience, damn. Props to u asapscience
Fax
Yes because teens and kids wach Youtube all the time, the last time I saw an adult wach Jake Paul was never
3019 = today without Jake Paul and his Asian counterpart
Why do our limbs "fall asleep"?
Do any of us really expect YouTube to take any action against a "creator" the drives so much ad revenue? Google and YouTube, and basically every other tech and social media platform that follows this business model selectively enforce their TOS. All they want is as many eyeballs watching videos for as long as possible, and it doesn't matter if a huge chunk of that viewership is impressionable kids.
Don't give your kids money? Simple as that folks
Best callout.
The only thing Jake Paul cares about is money.
He probably already knew and if he didn't he won't care, if it will makes  him money he will do it.
oof
Digital prices are the stupidest things ever
Anyone else see what kinds looks like a destiny logo at 2:37?
its "dear jake paul" and not "dear jake paul & ricegum" because ricegum is just an asian jake paul
I know someone very close to me who suffered from gambling addiction and it was heartbreaking for to see their life become ruined because of it and still refuse to get the help they needed. What Jake and Rice are going is absolutely terrible, exposing kids to something that can ruin them now and more importantly, in the future. But assholes like that I guess don't care because they just want to get paid
@jakepaul
First
the thing is, big YouTubers like Jake Paul, Logan Paul, and Ricegum are making way too much money for YouTube that according to their greed, they'll never take them down. Talking about responsible gambling, YouTube itself isn't even responsible for what it's supposed to be managing and how the rules should be followed.
The sad thing is jake Paul won’t even care about this video. He will go back to his shifty antics.
Pake Jaul
You know you messed up when even AsapScience calls you out.
This is my “Burning Question” - Why do we listen to the same song on repeat?
Never ever expected to see this channel release a video on jake paul. Interesting
Now this is what i signed up for.
This is amazing. You guys should make more videos like this relating science to current problems on youtube etc really creative
you guys are awesome !!! lesson learned
First pewdiepie now ASAPscience? Damn...
I understand that you feel this way and I do to but this is a science channel, can you please keep opinionated videos to second channels please. I understand that there was some science but that still wasnt enough, thanks.
Drugs, alcohol and gambling are the main things that will destroy society. I can guarantee that every person who is homeless, one of these factors contributed to it
( sends this to Jake Paul )
Thought this was a science channel
Man I hate him and his brother
hey i love you guys :)
Oi
All the dislikes are people who are fans of Jake Paul, or fans who don't want him to watch this video. This is not a bad video it is a video educating about Addiction not just a message to Jake Paul.
I’ve experienced this, I spent 500$ on supply drops alone in black ops 3. Every day I would buy em if i has the money. I was 15 at the time and was legitimately addicted. If I didn’t have the money my parents would lend it to me, I thank them for this however it’s probably wasn’t the best idea (sorry). I now save most of my money and only spend on things I NEED not WANT
Maturity
I like how this is addressed to Jake Paul and not Ricegum because although I hate them both equally Ricegum doesn't give 2 shits about anything other than money and clout whereas Jake Paul seems more receptive of criticism and advice (at it seems this way from Shane's docuseries)
I don't think there can ever be too much attention on issues like this that impact children.  I always find myself wanting to make a big video like this as well, this recent gambling issue is infuriating, but it's truly just the tip of the iceberg.
I’m 20, and I would definitely buy merchandise from PewDiePie and Markiplier.
Jake Paul's response is going to be like: "Lol love this vid <3"
Well said 💪💪
You know it's serious when ASAP Science has to get involved
cant convey how much i love asapscience for this
and subscribe for more weekly science videos..




Good video though
I am not surprised that gambling addiction being so close to drug or alcohol addiction. I'm surprised that it was not in the same category earlier. 

My dad is an alcoholic and I do seem to have gotten same of those genes. I can see similar patterns in my behavior. I become very easily obsessed over games. No matter how ridiculous the game is. (Candy crush saga level 4192 in 1,5 years...) So, I have totally banned myself gambling. Also, I am always really careful with addictive drugs. I do not use those if I don't absolutely need to. Alcohol I do use occasionally, but I have talked to my boyfriend about my addictive personality and told that also he should have really small threshold to tell me if my alcohol use ever makes him worried at all.
I can't get adicted...I usually get bored of things fastly or just know how to control myself.
It's not just trashy youtubers but gaming companies have started doing it with loot boxes as well. Why don't we have laws regulating these things yet? Is unregulated capitalism this evil that considers perfectly ok to introduce gambling to kids?
BOYCOTT JAKE PAUL
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A SCIENCE CHANNEL  :(
bravi, avete tutta la mia stima :)
AsapReacts
Loved this video!
Ppl who watch JakePaul videos, actually deserve to lose money on this shit. Natural selection at its best.
It’s Tmartn and Syndicate all over again 😭
we know jake paul and ricegum don't have the brains to understand this video.. I can't wait too see what's gonna happen to those two in 10 years once their audience grows up
Yeah, I buy pewdiepie merch. What about it?
Thank GOD we have ASAP science so us theorists don't sound like haters.
Gacha games
Anyone remember me?
Great video, wish those mentioned in it would care enough to stop🤷🏻‍♀️
Thumbnail:
"GAMBLINFOR KIDSG"
When you want views 😂
Thank you, thank you, thank you for making this!
The Truth Is That Jake Paul Has Become Too Big To Fail From YouTube's Prespective Which Is Sad! Any Smaller YouTube Creator Would of Been Permanently Banned From YouTube A Long Time Ago, If They Even Did One of The Many Bad Things The Paul's Have Done!
There Audience Is So Big That YouTube Dosn't Want Them Switching Platforms! Honestly These Few Irresponsible Creators Are The Reason For So Many Heavy Handed Policy Changes That Effect Everyone And Also Triggered The YouTube Add-Apocalypse Which Is Killing All The Smaller YouTube Creator's...
This is an amazingly well done video yet it’s not going to get trending since it targets YouTube’s broken guidelines and one of their revenue machines
Educate Jake Paul lmao as if he would ever learn something meaningful
Best of wishes to you all 😄
Spill the tea my friend
I'm surprised if Jake Paul would understand any of this video
Not all heroes wear capes...
Only problem is that I don’t know ASAP’s audience age range. So this vid might not be seen by the young audience
I really hope he watches this...
rightful anger
It definitely seems scamish but I really dont see how this is gambling...? How is it different then Ipsy, loot crate or those monthly subscription boxes where you dont know what your getting? And sure maybe he shouldnt be promoting a scam but in the long run shouldnt the parents know what their kids are buying with their credit cards? A better title would have been Dear Parents but I guess that wouldn't have the click bait you wanted.
Joke Paul
They both are brain dead though.
Dopamine isn't the reward.  Endorphins and enkephalins are. Dopamine produces the "wanting".
To be fair there is a similar problem in the gaming industry- gacha/lootbox games. They have predatory practices and their main target is children and teenagers. Sure they state that you should seek adult permission before buying in gsme currency to gamble in game, but with gift cards and obtaining credit card numbers are so easy for teens. Maybe more can be done to ensure children and young teens are educated on the impacts of gambling, or stricter guidelines must be enforced on gacha/lootbox games, such as the Belgium lootbox ban
How does rice gum get a young audience when his videos are all about “will you rub this booty”
Not defending him, just wanting to know
Positive YouTuber VS Negative YouTuber 
Or in this case
Asapscience Vs Jack Paul
So proud of you @asapscience
I tried sending it to him... got blocked by him.
YASS👏🏻CALL👏🏻THEM👏🏻OUT!👏🏻
1:04
With the use of drugs doesn't the brain internalize the receptors so that there are less receptors exposed rather than creating more of them?
You know you’ve fallen from grace when even a channel like ASAP Science is calling you out.
I love this! You tell him want not to do without make a diss track! You guys are awesome!😘🥰😍
Did rice and Jake get away with this without any repercussions?!?
Thank you. Love this. So educational and graceful.
I reckon the Paul brothers are the product of severe inbreeding.
This was great
Dear Jake Paul, FOAD
the only jake paul video id watch is one of him filming himself jumping in front of a train
Great job!
We need to make this trend right NOW!
Jake Paul is watching this crying his eyes out relating to his cocaine addiction.
Well addressed asapsci! Kids should understand this before blindly following them.
first

Welcome back to ASAP-POLOTICS
listen, i’m not talking about the ethics of the wall, but i will say that the money argument is not good. $5.7 billion is peanuts to the federal government. and even if the 5.7 isn’t forked out, it will get wasted on something else... that’s how the government works.

“I’m bill gates”
Buy T Series and delete it.
imagine how many hydrogen atoms you could buy with that much money
maybe 12, or even more!
Well, for a start, the wall will cost at least 23 billion dollars from just the transport due to having to build roads to get to the construction site costing 11 billion dollars.

Then, take the cost of the materials, the equipment, the fuel cost, and of course labour. 

It would take at least 1000 people to make it as the stretch is at 1000 miles. Also, taking into account that the minimum wage for a builder on a large scale job like this is a lot higher than the average builder wage. This would probably cost about 20,000 dollars an hour (suggesting that there is only 1000 people)
You can get a few gallons of gas in California
I’d use it for 3 reasons.

1. Maybe buy a business cuz I need to make money too
2. Donate some to me and my friends’ lil project and we can cruise in a private jet.
3. Buy robux (don’t judge mehhhhhh)

"I will build a great wall, and no one builds walls better than me."
Donald J. Trump
Do how much you can buy with AOC’s “new deal” that costs about an estimated 70 trillion. Or California’s 20 billion dollar train that is pointless.

Edit: never mind those are both democratic proposals they won’t make a video exposing dems
I think your maths may be wrong on some of these
Subtle flex but okay
the flint really shook me... like if we all knew how little it would cost to fix the water especially compared to how much we actually spend, we could easily pass a bill to get the funds they need. 55 million, it would cost 17 cents per person in this country to fix flints water supply why is this still an issue.

I could buy 5.6 billion 1 dollars burritos at Taco Bell, then use the rest of the money for the medical bills from eating all of those burritos
I’m conservative but Trump is definitely exaggerating the border crisis. I feel as if he’s doing this just because he promised people
Lots and lots of bubble wrap.
I would prefer that Flint's water pipes are fixed and that we have single payer healthcare way before building a damn wall.
You could enslave buy scientists to do surgery on a grape
You could buy 1/2 of a EA game
honestly a wall sounds much better than most on the things mentioned in the video
Yeah but who needs healthcare when you can have a wall Am I right
I just did the math, and the actual percent of US debt from 5.7 billion is 0.0263888%

I don’t see how this debunks paying for a wall, some of the uses you brought up are good like solar panels and medicine but most of it is just unnecessary like strawberries
5.7 billion is literally nothing compared to the us budget
Cool, cool, cool. 1:55 THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A WALL
Corruption??
One thing you couldnt buy is the US military
First the science of racism and now this I think you should stay out if the political side of things

Shush with the dang vaccine.
What could you have bought with the TRILLIONS that OBAMA Spent on CRAP
But seriously, there are so many better things that money could be spent on (looking at the vaccine on in particular)
When you think 5.7 bill is big in the grand scheme of the us budget. Oof
Okay yeah but alot of these aren't as beneficial as creating a wall is. I was expecting some spicy examples >:[
Damn you can hella buy weed and wax
imagine how much robux you could get
Who else got a trump ad before the vid?
I would buy a wall and put this channel and all the snowflakes on the other side
Imagine the number of boyband concerts I could go to
you can also buy a ton of ladders for people to climb over the wall
I instantly thought of buying food and now I'm hungry and it's 1am and I should be asleep in the first place aaaahhhhhh 😭
I see a lot of these videos going around but one thing that they all fail to take into account is how much illegal immigration is costing the US a year, by the way it’s a lot more than $5 billion
Irony at its highest
How about asking how much a US military jet costs...
We could pay all the people who don’t have jobs because of the government shutdown with that money....
You can also waste that much on a government shutdown lol

Watching this I just keep hearing it's not that much money. I mean I know that the politics of the creators are opposed to the wall, personally I don't care either way. That said the 5.7 billion can be covered by individual taxpayers, not corporations just people, paying about 73 cents per week for one single year... how much do you pay weekly in taxes?
Wow so many dislikes, people really want a wall
I gues it's to make a good attack on titan live action movie, if thats even posible

Also Trump supporters 'I need to downvote this video because it made me feel bad'
Oh man. That's rich. We could buy Teslas or solar panels for a select few. I'd rather have a wall since I'd never see any of these benefits.
So will it be called the Great Fence of America?
I can buy the biggest pc in the world

They KNOW it will cost more than $5.7 billion!  That's just a down payment.

Only 150,000 student loan debts, that’s sad
how does the wikipedia one work
I could build a wall to keep illegal immigrants out.
I got a trump ad before this. Oof.
For those who are confused about how or why this video has a place on a “science” YouTube channel... electric cars, solar panels, vaccines, dirty/poisoned water, and healthcare (just to name a few of the video’s examples) all directly tie into science. Also, some colleges/universities classify a degree in political-science as a “science degree”.
the best of all this is that Mexico’s not paying :)
Anyone Belizean in the comments? (Probably not)
Trump thinks simple but costly... literally.
The wall is good
20 billion wall that will be breachable with a cheap ladder. Trumponomics ftw.
You could pay for a quarter of the annual maintenance cost of ONE us aircraft carrier
Trump has left the chat
Build the wall
Build the wall
This is passive aggressive. I love it.
Those Mexicans are sure gonna be coming fast
Im pretty sure that wall would cost more than an estimate of 5.7 bills to build from coast to coast. The wall needs huge amount of wood , concrete, metals. Not only u need boarder patrols to watch over their tower there every single day yet , workers and builders , labors to work night and day. This is not even including transportation funds for all the materials they need to build that wall
I could buy couple isis slves
Look Trump I love ya, and know we need the wall, but after finding out how many big macs I can get you better pay up don
I’m not a person who really cares too much about political views or parties or whatever, and these comments show why.

It felt nice seeing you as an anti trump
Pay off 2 student loans
Honestly $1000 or $100 wouldnt be bad.
Trump really loves wasting the nation’s money 😔✊🏼
a lot of stuff
Only 5.7 billion?
I kiNDA support the wall, but the amount of shade it will cause is scary...
We could also build the wall which will stop most of the illegal aliens
Half of the money ill contribute to NASA so we can now find answers to all the theories that they have
For all the US people out there, in the UK trump means fart, you’re welcome

Edit: so many likes!!! Thank you 😀
I would buy my private army and invade Cuba and then start my own nation.
The real question here is how many government workers can be paid with that amount of money.
Build that wall!
Or you could just buy the wall
I'd buy some ramen and a Nokia
This is not science this is political
Why are you trying to make this a political vid. Try not to be biased please!
Well that's a lot of strawberries
honestly I hate Trump and I think that he's a bit of a child but what does this have to do with science? I subscribed to this channel for a reason. I've been subscribed for the past 3 years or so and I've noticed this channel take a downturn not a downturn in views or clicks or whatever but lower quality.
Or.....
You could build a wall along our (U.S.A.) southern border, and fund upgrades to our border security. This would not only give Americans peace of mind but also dissuade people from attempting a very dangerous illegal border crossing. I am the son of a mexican immigrant that went through the proper channels to become an American citizen. 
Unfortunately, we have lost a family member to an attempt at crossing the border illegally. 
You may think that you're  being kind by trying to leave the border unsecured, but until someone you love dies trying to cross it, I ask that you rethink your position. 
Few people would try making this dangerous journey if they knew there was very little chance of success, and hopefully that would encourage them to put their time, and effort into gaining access through citizenship.

That FENTY mention really restores my faith in humanity
There was so much shade in this video, I had to step out into the sun
You can buy my family’s college.
This makes me angry
The average American year spending is 400 trillion so 5.7 billion is nothing.To out that in to perspective that would be like if a person who makes 80k a year bought a $1 coffee.
It's just sad/funny (depending how you look at it) that he promised a wall, one that Mexico would pay for, and now is asking tax payers to chip in instead. 
He just conned his supporters, whether or not you believe the wall will do something the fact is that one of his iconic campaign promises, was a blatant lie (not surprising though)
literally 5.7 billion dollars is nothing thats 57$ out of a 44,070$ budget
#BuildTheWall
y’all do realize that even though the wall cost 5.7 billion the government just doesn’t give 5.7 billion dollars to someone to build it😂
You could pay for .05% of how much illegal immigrants cost the US
Question- What if our population were to double over night. What happen to the planet. Also what pros and cons would happen due to the sudden change. Would people over populate the planet or could we think of a way to save both the people and the planet. From things such as pollution and or maybe an increase in violence?
0:32 the problem is not money, the problem are the antivaxxers
lmao 5.7 billion dollars only covers 150,000 college students debt, just shows how much debt there is
Or you could build a wall that is pocket change to protect all citizens in the United States.
The amount of liters my Charger has
1:57 TRUMP YOU SHOULD REALLY DO THAT
That’s like 8 Whole Foods avocados
So much bias with this lgbtqi channel
The 6 billion Trump is using for the wall is less than .01 of the governments annual budget lol
me: looks at title sees number

me:well then why so exzact?
I'd pay T-series to stop
Orange man bad
What could you buy with the billions of dollars illegal immigration costs the country each year? 🤔
A small loan
Yeah I bet illegal immigrants haven’t thought  of ladders yet we’re to advanced
Edit: it’s a joke chill ik you can’t get over the wall with a ladder
What to do with this information
0:24 Flint Flint hahahahaha
A boy in my class would buy Robux
Oh boy & below me are just all political comments
“1.7 billion people could get a free pumpkin spice latte”
Oh here are the liberals expecting things to be handed to them for free
I’M GONNA BUILD A WALL , IT’S GONNA BE THE BIGGEST WALL OF ALL TIME
We could secure our border
You can buy less than half of one aircraft carrier, but try to stop building one of those defense units at a true-blue unionized shipyard and see how the dems feel about that.
invest in stopping plastic in oceans as well as in space
a bunch of missles
You know what I can buy with $5.7 dollars? 





Shoes
Yeet
Don't buy it. Just build it.
or make the wall and save all the money we spend on illegals every year to fix all these problems as you say and then some but ok...
Why do you have to get political.
5,1 trillion robux
If there is no wall you can't buy anything after a while...
Remember when ASAPScience did SCIENCE videos?
What could you do with the money saved that wouöd be otherwise be spended on illegal immigrants ? 🤔
If only something like 200,000 electric cars could be bought then no wonder people drive normal cars
How is this a science channel
You can buy 950,000 $60 games without tax
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Well borders don’t mean anything an imaginary line saying USA will keep out 100% of all illegals smh
And buying most of those things for the people would make you a communist, and we don’t want that. Build the wall and build it tall
Wow it's really sad howthey're using that money to keep people away when really we could use that money to prevent death and Safe lives😤
The equivalent of spending $5.7 billion out of a $4.4 trillion budget is $57 from a $44,000 income. Imagine you wanna put up a fence at your house for only $57 but your spouse gets so mad they shut everything down for a month and run off on vacation.
All that money could be used for something like this
We could Oh yeah yeah
Myself out of poverty.
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
not muh conservatism
if i got that money i would of finally make my dream






BUYING A GAMING PC !!!!!
Oh yeah yeah
I got a trump ad lmao
Or like start an astoroid mining company
Imagine how much Ramen you could buy..
So trump made a 5.7 billion wall NOT useful? Thanks trump
5.7 billion can buy all those rip its
Build The Wall.
If we can buy that much with a wall (which by someone trying to disprove it put it equal to NASA which is at 0.5% of the US tax budget) than OHHHH BOY can't wait to see how much we could buy when cutting the 3 social services (SS, Medicare and Medicaid at around 80% of the US tax budget.)

That there's a hefty increase of 160X.
Well... This is depressing
Oh yeah yeah
Buy an island and 🖕🏽everyone else
So remember when ASAP Science was about science and did have such obvious biases. Those were the good old days
What about schools funds? My school is poor
spill the tea
Right next to this video on my suggested I saw a video about the 3.8 billion dollar NASA plan to save the US from Yellowstone supervolcano
I thought this was a science channel
Well the last time I checked our GDP is 14-15 trillion so basically it’s nothing.
Well with $100 billion dollars from the iran deal you could literally by 20 times more of what you said.
I think ill stick with the wall
Well if you really want to make America great again, you should make trump watch the video😒
Oh great, their going liberal. I thought this was a smart channel.
asapPoliticalAgenda
Wow that's so cool! That means as soon as the wall is built all the money saved by it could be used for all those things and also provide border security wow trump is so smart
so, so much he could've done with that money, and he chose to build a wall.
How the hell is this science?
Ayo the 19 billion green plan sounds like a good idea
Now what can you buy with $116 billion? (Annual illegal immigrant cost)
That’s a lot of robux
You know the wall is worth it because Honduras and Guatemala (the countries We’ll be blocking out) are the most crime ridden countries in the entire world. And guess what, they have walls around their homes too! To protect their families and valuables from, you guessed it, criminals.
Illegal immigration cost the US 50-200 BILLION annually.... what could we buy with that?
Oh yeah yeah
with that kinda of money we could help stop immigration costing us more money
#buildthewall
What Can You Buy with All That Money That Is Spent On Foreign Countries?
Mrbeast would find something to buy like 1billion of
... You buy a wall 


How useless
How much garlic bread?
We actually need the wall, it would stop illegal people coming in our country and Killing, or harming what we have.
Unsubbing, I wanted science but got political junk instead.
0:36 blame the anti vaxxers
I can by 5.7 billion 99flakes
What can you buy for 39.5billion dollars?? (the amount of foreign aid we will send to Israel in the next 7 years)
Our 2019 defense budget is around 700 billion and you uninformed fools think 5 billion is some outlandish number.
.01% of the budget...
It could help us keep illegal immigrants out
Can you do a vid on why we sneeze and the science of sneezing and other thing to do with the nose please! 👃👃👍
Good thing 5.7 billion dollars is less than 1% of our GDP.
Im triggered and the wall would save america 50billion
Airpods
Why do people act like a 5 billion dollar wall is a lot when we spend more than that on development of one aircraft
Ok ik this is off topic BUT I NEED HELP

so basically I have naturally slim eyebrows and I’ve been trying to grow them with castor oil over the years. But they stay the same and I don’t even get them done ‘cuz they’re already so slim that I want them to grow in the places that I’m supposed to pluck.




I came to this video bc it’s the last video of “AsapSCIENCE” and idk how else to request a video? Soo yeah. Sorry if I bothered anyone.
Answer: Clean water for Flint
could get 1million people to stop following your channel
These guys presented facts, like they always do on this channel. Please have an open mind to not only this, but all facts you come across, it’ll help everyone
Great science content.
That money could help end hunger here in the US and assist other country's as well
You can fund 5 losing hillary clinton campaigns
I would buy normal things
now do it for the 32 trillion dollar health care plan
Build the wall, save double that every year due to the decrease of illegal immigrants and spend it on your proposals
lel
Wait a minute 0:58
I'd spend 5.7 billion dollars on a stripper
1:32 i thought that was maine
You could buy Hillary’s emails back
Kylie Jenner could buy enough likes to beat that egg again

You could also pay 10% the amount it takes to take care of illegal immigrants in the USA
“What can you buy with 5.7 billion dollars?”

Something a whole lot nicer than a wall, that’s for sure..
I would pay to remove the border and buy a lot of cool tech but no cringe tech like the rainbow keyboards I wonder if those are cringe
This is a science channel.  We get it, you don't like him, I don't either.  I subscribe to this channel for science.  Tired of Trump being brought into everything these days.
Why do you have to mention that it’s trumps wall cost?
I do like that you guys are calling out stupid people now haha
The science of how a science channel has political views
Or buy two iphones

BUILD THE WALL
I could buy 1,628,571 hoax hate crimes with that money
Doonld trump should see this.
ASAPPolitics
A wall
Ayyyyyyy. Belize
Haha you should also do the amount of things you could buy with the amount it costs to have illegal aliens
I could compete with bill gates
I could buy lot of a lettuce

Why is this video a thing
This video was made to enlighten Trump
AsapPolitics
I wonder what you can buy with $150 billion dollars (what Obama gave Iran, our enemies) Could you do a video on that ASAPScience?
that just makes me wonder what they do with all our money because 5.7 billion is a drop in the bucket and theres a lot of things in America that need to be fixed
I know I’m not gonna like this one ☝️
Funny thing is most illegal inmigration doesnt come through the border
t u b e r c u l o s i s , yes , looking at you Arthur
Damn she went off
And why would we do any of that?
Still want a wall
You can also do a lower military spending. Today it‘s 600.000.000.000 (600 Billion) dollars and it‘s the biggest military spending in the World. Second place is china with 230 Billion dollars. You could do a Video about what you could do with 600 Billion dollars. You could buy 105 walls and everything in this Video multiplied by 105.
I would buy fortnite to make fortnite great again
All this money spend on a wall when it could be spend in many other helpful ways
Or you could take it out of the military budget
Wtf! Thats half of what ford class aircraft carrier costs. Wtf is wrong with America being cheap to things they need???
The federal budget is 3.8 TRILLION dollars son 5.7 billion is like you have 100,000 that 5.7 billion for 3.8 trillion would be like 50 dollars
Make a video of what you can buy with 800 billion dollar (which is how much USA spends on military a year)
But what about the vbucks in fortnite?
America gave me a small loan of 5 billions dollars
Thanks libtards. Unsubscribed.
The wall won't fix the problem it would actually hurt America in the long run. 
1. Steel prices have gone up 
2. Americans debt is now sitting at 21 trillion 
3. The wall would cost way more then the 5.7 billion he estimated 
4. Most immigrants don't cross the border in dead spots. Most of it is at the point of entry or they get a Visa or visit family and then never leave. 
5. Walls are easily climbed 
6. There are serious ecological consequences to building the wall 
7. The wall does no good if there is nobody protecting it
8. The wall could take years to build 
9. Huge ecology consequences 
10. They can get in a boat and enter through the coast
Anything you want
Can Trump donate me the money please, I am so broke.
Or you can cut military spending in half
I hope Trump sees this ☺️
ASAP SCIENCE!!!!!
Absolute proof Trump is the dumbest human the devil has ever spawned.
I think this should have been in your other channel, due to it being politically sensitive topic, but I agree Trump's wall is a colossal waste of money.
Reads title

Uh oh
I like the Wikipedia one
One word. Sweden.
CuckScience
But instead we should definitely spend it on something so pointless that youd have to have the mind of an 8 year old to think it would be even slightly effective
Dude, you can pay rent for every homeless person but you can't pay back everyone's student loans. I think that says a lot about our education system.
An estimated 1.34 trillion dollars will cost the federal government for Obama care over the next decade cmon Obama could have cleaned up Chicago
This wall will save millions of Americans from drug use and cartels and also will save hundreds of cities from illegal immigrants but still good video though.
So it's really not that much money
Electric cars are actually worse for the environment than gas cars. One of the main reasons for this is CO2 emissions that come from creating the actual car. Over 2 metric tons of CO2 are emitted in the process of making the electric car; gas powered cars produce far less. This is mostly because of the batteries which are much more difficult to make. As well as creating more CO2 in the process of making it, electric car batteries require fracking for precious metals which can lead to soil erosion, air and water pollution, and oil spills. The electricity that powers the car comes from fossil fuels and is just converted to electricity. While emissions will not be coming from the car directly, they will come from the fuel plants creating the electricity. So the term "gas-free" is irrelevent and inacurate in this instance. Therefor, electric cars are not really the way to "go green".
Its so sad to see how people who make youtube videos try to push political opinions into their videos
$5.7B out of $4.4T annual budget is nothing. That’s $57 out of $44,000. Idk why dems are so spiteful to Trump when they’ve approved more money for border security in the past.
This is rough...
ASAP science goes liberal
Some one show this to trump
politics
I could probably buy 1 textbook with that money
I only want it if it's all in pennies
U could guess this videos sponsored
All that for a wall
What I would do with 5.7 billion dollars: I would build a big frickin wall on the border of Mexico.
5.7 isn’t even that much
Wow , so now everyone have become saint forgetting that U.S Military Expenditure is more than $600 Billion !
Do a video about what we could buy with the 38 Billion dollars given to Israel
Ehhh I’ll still stay with the wall.
Please, stick to science. I don’t watch ASAP Science for political videos
or you could buy a a bunch of cars
LUMBAGO
the homeless one wouldve helped statistics soo much. they only have 9 months until they have to be able to live off of theirselves😧
Whooping cough can kill you.....?
Of course (im not ironic) you should keep Wikipedia running for 228 years
Does anyone else know that the wall would cost .10% of our national budget? That's 1/10th of 1 percent of our national budget. People say it's Trumps fault for keeping the government shutdown but Democrats refuse to budge or negotiate. I wish this video would explain how much money it really is compared to our budget. Rather than show it as a waste of money.
0:34 Antivaxxers have left the chat
Pay off 2 student loans
You could obviously build a wall
How to solve so many political problems: Citizens can choose how their taxes are allocated. If people want a wall, they fund it. If people want healthcare, they fund it. People who didn't allocate their taxes to certain things? They don't reap the benefits or have to pay for crap they don't need/want. I'd imagine it would give higher initiative to work, as well!
You can give every person in the USA 15 extra dollars
I have it when YouTube channels go political for attention
tbh the walla ganna be a good idea in 100 years when the population and immigrants are x100 worse then what it is.

This is a fun comment section
But you know what 5.7 billion dollars could really do 




Help end ILLEGAL immigration
yall know the wall only stops MEXICAN immigrants that cross the border by LAND, not immigrants from other countries and those who go by sea or fly. but yall just blame mexicans. Tea 😌✨✨💅

PS i dont see yall building a wall for CANADA but thats the tea 😌✨✨💅
Honestly would rather security at the border. We have a security crisis at the border and I don’t think liberals understand that.
Spitting facts!
You can get 400 million hand jobs.
I will take the tesla s
Well you guys should make a video on what we could do with the amount of money we spend on illegal immigration annually. You may not though since you only show the left side :) Not the truth :)
The 5.7 billion is an equivalent of like 50 dollars of the us budget if you take out all the extra 0’s
Someone send this to the President, better yet, Obama
How  much would you pay for saving 1,500 humans lives annually from border invaders? and 5000 people from violent attacks annually?
Use that money for free health care
Umm, Trump should  forget the wall, I'm getting some chocolates first
Politics has 0% effect on science. Showing some flashy that could or couldn’t work is not the way to fix things, if anything needs to be fixed anyways. I’m disappointed that another factual YouTube channel has yet again fed into the dirty game of politics. Quite sad, as you were one of the good ones.
This isn’t science
I’d just use it to get whatever I want
We could’ve built 30 walls with the money that Obama gave to the Middle East
Period.
Instead of giving this to charity, help homeless people, why not make an enormous wall, stretching more than a thousand mile and waste valuable resources.
Donald Trump is insane if he is going to make Mexico pay for the wall. I mean he’s gotta be out of his mind 5.7B.   WT!
Many of those things are one time or one year purchases. A wall would last for many years and lessen the amount spent by the US on these illegals and their kids
At least 5 tacos
Now do one where you tell us what we can buy with the $50B+ saved per year from the investment of a wall!
But it wouldn’t be fair to only give a certain percent of the population those items with the money.
So wait .... 5.7 BILLION is only a quarter of what nasa spends a year? That seems ... excessive but what do I know
TRUMPTARDS: AHH! LIBERAL, FAKE BIASED NEWS!!
Watches Conservative Pro- Trump videos 24/7


(Triggered? You shouldn't be if it's not true)
There’s no price high  enough to keep our country safe from invaders.
Not to mention that the wall will do almost nothing to prevent illegal immigration.
We still need a wall though
LOL $5.7 billion is a drop for the US govt.  You can put “what can you buy for...” in front of any expensive govt expenditure and say the same thing... literally do you even understand how much money was spent by Obama administration (the biggest govt spender in US history) & much of that money was wasted.  
Also aren’t y’all Canadian??  How can you expect to fully understand a foreign problem when you do not deal with the extreme repercussions that come along with our border issues
Imagine how dumb this video is
Okay but how how is this science?
But what about the U.S. Special Forces budget? It is 700 billion dollars invested in the safety of American citizens yet the wall aims to accomplish safety on a different scale.
Next up: What could you buy with 150 billion dollars besides a country giving "their word"?

Oh oh or maybe: What could you buy with 100+ billion dollars saved after you build a wall and stop illegal immigration?
0:45 well no because libs would abort the child in the first place
Or you can keep out illegal immigrants.who also commit a lot of crimes.
Or you could just stick to the first idea and build a wall
imagine a world where asapscience makes science videos
this video is being brigaded
Do a video an what 150 billion could buy that Obama gave to Iran.
This comment section 
50% righties getting mad over nothing 
30% people making jokes about what they would buy with the money 
10% people wishing this channel didn't get political 
10% lefties trying to explain to righties that most illegals come by plane and boat
Yayy now make one with 116 Billion Dollars.(Illegal Immigrants' Cost)
”The US spending a lot of money if they build that 5.7 billion dollar wall.”
That’s literally 0.1% of the federal spending. 

”Oh yeah a wall doesn’t stop illegal immigrants.”
First of all, it doesn’t. Illegal immigration cannot be fully stopped because people will still do it. But having border security discourages migrants from making the dangerous journey.

For example, 60,000 unaccompanied children arriving in 2018 alone. (25% increase). Due to the risk of human trafficking, drug trafficking, violent gangs and murder.


Walls are basically barriers. Meaning that it will slow down the influx of drugs and illegal immigrants from coming in. A barrier works as an obstacle to make it harder for drug trafficking, human smugglers, illegal immigrants, etc to easily come in. People will still find ways to get in the country illegally. We do have a fence, but guess what? The fence is not even completed nor connected. Some are more secured, most are easily vulnerable, and a big portion of the border is still unguarded. Especially in Texas and Arizona where there’s no fence at all. Having a barrier will slow down illegal immigrants as soon as possible, making it easier for border patrol with the advanced technology and resources we have to catch them. My uncle who works in the Homeland Security and also a border patrol agent in California says it will make their job much easier due to the fact that a fortified steel wall with cameras, heat censors and guard towers will essentially monitor daily activities. And if a need arises, border patrol agents can respond quickly and efficiently to any immigrants attempting to cross in the first place.


We’re specially talking about securing the southern border. If liberals really want to argue about overstayed visas, why not support ICE? Instead of calling them nazis, they are just regular people enforcing immigration and custom laws. We need to increase accountability and budget for ICE to make it easier for them to catch overstayed visa holders.

Also shoutout to all the ICE officers, border patrol agents and the national guard helping to secure our border. Thank you to all law enforcement and military!
That’s a lot of mcchickens
This money is like nothing to r county
Honestly this is less money than i thought now
Could passively protect millions of Americans with a WALL or spend 10 times that giving away free aid to other countries like we do now, hmmmm
I’m surprised he doesn’t just go for the solar panel since he’s gonna start taxing people who have them as he starts to head for CLEAN COAL
You can buy border security.
Or you could give 5.7 billion dollars to me
5.7 billion for a wall?? I see why America is & will forever be in dept
Keep wikipedia running for 228 years? Are you saying wikipedia pays roughly around 2million dollars a MONTH to keep it going?
Or we could've built like 4 walls with the money Obama gave to Iran but ya know.
What I could do with that money...
A 2018 study shows that natural citizens commit crime at a higher rate than immigrants regardless of their legal status. Also, illegal immigration has been rapidly increasing in the past 20 years, while at the same time, crime has been rapidly decreasing. And, only a small percentage of drugs are smuggled over the border by means other than hiding them in vehicles going through border gates. So please, explain to me how a wall is going to “fix” crime and drug trafficking.
Still not enough money to fix Trump's hair
0:40 BOAH
Fun fact:
135 Billion Dollars per Year is the financial burden on US tax payers that illegal immigrants drain from the US systems. (FAIR’s findings)
Someone send this to Trump
Ask one of the angle moms if she would traded her murdered child for 5.7 billion ? I know I would. No amount would be too much. MAGA!!!
IMAGINE ALL THE PUPPIES WE COULD BUY!!!!! 🐶🐶🐶
Now do a video on what you could buy with the 150 billion dollars that Obama gave to Iran
We would keep out  the illegals
ASAP science more like ASAP politics
Video starts making sense at 1:41
Maybe next we could see what Hillary and Schumer put towards border reinforcement ($68 billion)
Or you could get a border wall, which would save the US 135 billion a year. Sooo you should make a video about what 135 billion could be spent on
You need to go to da dentist every 6 month
I’m pretty sure if he said that he wants to put a person on Mars you’d be 1000% against it, unless it was him.
Now do a video about what you could buy with the cost for supporting illegal immigrants every year.
vaccinations are creating diseases !
V-Bucks
Build the wall
- A mexican
Actually tho, trump is using this money very poorly fr tho
You know it’s also got a 800 billion dollar budget? Take away the zeros and say you have 800 dollars trump is only taking $5 of that 800 budget that he’s allowed to use
This is what happens when you let a pumpkin head rule your country.
Now do one for the 135 billions dollars illegal immigration costs the US every year
Every trump voter would only need to pay 87 $
How much do the funerals cost for those who were murdered by illegal aliens?
Now you gotta do a video of what could be bought with the $114 billion that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers annually
Donate 3 dollars to wikipedia
Just cut the money to planned parent hood

BUILD THAT WALL
All this money still couldn’t buy me a girlfriend
Hey wanna know something cool? If you say anything even close to a political opinion it will start a war in the chat. For example Trump is really bad and I can’t wait till 2020 where he will NOT be elected again.
Good job Trump 👍
You can keep our millions of filthy illegals with 5.7 billion too
Why 5.7 b ?
We can buy a peaceful and prosperous nation without illegal immigrants for $5.7 billion. Worth it imo.
0:34 can we do that instead of building a wall that will 
1. Barley do much to stop people from coming into America. 
2. A waste a time
3. Most of the people that immigrate here only come here for a better life, they come here to help their family get out of other dangerous things back home. Not to steal, deal anything, or anything else hurtful to the U.S


No one take this personal this is just my opinion you don’t have to respect it.


Edit: Here’s another thought we could also help people that are homeless, the people that can afford food for their kids Or themselves.
Didn’t realize this channel was so libtard based. The wall in proportion to the budget is approximately $5 out of $4000. But yea 34 billion strawberries is the same as protecting American lives
How many lives have we saved by not electing Hilary and starting WW3?
Trump is shook
I love how they are low key throwing shade at trump, in the most non-chalante, they be like “you could spend this much money on the wall, or you could spend it on much more pressing matters “😂
The budget is 4.4 trillion and 5.7 billion is a very very very small portion so I don’t think this videos is actually truthful in the notion that this would be a “waste of money” to keep illegal immigrants out
Another wall lol
Why the hell would I want basically any of this.
We The People Will Fund The Wall  is on gofundme its at 20mil
What you could do with the money is help the countries that people are leaving so that they don't go into America illegally.
Nice vid!
I rather take the strawberry
I'd use it to make Mexico more welcoming. The reason why there is an immigration problem is that they are trying to escape, if Mexico was more inviting they wouldn't have much of a reason to cross the border.
Center of immigration studies estimates that illegal immigration costs taxpayers  $134.5  billion per year. Even if the wall costs 10 times as much as trump says, if it stops even 50 percent of illegal immigrants from central & south america, it pays for itself threefold. But you dont care about that. Ornj man bad.
What can you buy with the $1.5 TRILLION tax cut Trump gave the wealthiest this last year?
Vbucks.
Um??? Trump? How are you anti-Mexican death spikes beautiful?
This isn’t science
You wanna know what you can buy with 5.7B dollars? You could buy trumps wall, duh
Everyone in the comments says that this video is politically biased but they are giving solid facts as to what the money could be used for.
😮
Vbucks?
I smell bias
America spends $600 billion on the military every year, im sure they could do everything in this video if they really wanted to, but they don't and wont.
Well do something other than what my country’s idiot of a prime minister and not buy a non existent pipeline
How much could you buy with 120 billion? That's how much illegal immigrants cost every year after the small amount of taxes they pay.
but the real question is, how many chocolate bars could you get with that much money?
I don't agree with Trump or building the wall but I don't really think it is good to compare things like this. By that logic our society can't work because you can always say that money put in something could have been put to something more important. Why would we build sport fields if we can put that money for children that have rare desise and require expensive treatment? Why invest money in science (especially those fields that are not connected with medical research) when there are so many people dying of starvation every day? And also every one of us; why are we buying everything other than what we need when we could put that money in something better? Our society is not concentrate on just staying alive; partially because people are selfish but also because that is the only way to make progress. You can't always know why some research would be important or how it can make our lifes better. There are also things like investing in military; in peace it looks like wasting money but when someone like Hitler appear you understand the importance of it. Because of this I think this video is on the wrong track; you can say that you don't think something is good (like building a wall) and why you think that, but just saying how that money is huge and how you can spend it otherwise is irelevante.
Love watching your videos. Also, thanks to everyone who is reading this, have a nice day. :)
Ya well the money that Obama gave to Iran or something I forget whare but you could buy 3 walls
You could buy an obvious anti trump bias
Or you could build a wall that stops illegal immigrants
Pay Donald Trump to resign
Bringing politics into the channel = dislike
Yes we get it. You don't like Trump.
How about... paying national debt?
I used to like these guys, until they went political
All the healthcare numbers are INSIGNIFICANT

2,6 million kids is less than 1% of the population, vaccinating less 1% of the population is equivalent to building a wall to keep the drugs and hepatitis needles outside of the US, it’s a stupid idea to do with 5.6 billion dollars
Hard Pills to swallow for Trumpanzees:

- The Wall is not getting built and Mexico would never pay for it.
- The Swamp just got 10 feet deeper.
- Trump is the dumbest president in the history of the USA.
- You are bad for America.
- The entire World is laughing at you.
"5.7 billion dollars is too much money for a wall"

tries to force socialism on America which will cost 40 trillion
Or we could build the wall, which would keep most illegals out and the drugs that are smuggled in and so forth. You know the same thing your beloved Obama, Clinton's Pelosi and Schumer talked about but never did. The only reason they oppose it now is because they don't want the other party getting anything done so they can try and win the next election. Sad you cant see any of this. They are putting themselves before the people they represent.
Yeah don’t you just hate when your president tries to protect the citizens of the country he runs it’s literally the worst. But that last guy that said the same thing as the new guy without acting on it yeah he was the greatest.
Who else got a trump ad before this vid?
If you live in a country with free education and healthcare you feel really good when watching this video
A life?
T R U M P   F O R   2 0 2 0
Wait he was actually serious with that idea
You can buy peace of mind and safety for all Americans. Jackass!!!
Belize Navidad
Kinda sad to see a science channel, become one that just spits their political view to their viewers. We get it you two are left leaning, maybe just maybe, y’all could post stuff about, I don’t know, SCIENCE
I could get a lot of gold diggers with that money
0:34 this is just awful. I understand that immigration problems are occurring, but take care of your own people first 😕
This video is very suggestive that the money taken from the wall is contributing to americas problems. Maybe instead of going after our president trying to secure our borders, maybe go after our enormous military budget.
What can you buy with 175 billion dollars that we will save every year with the wall?
Hmu
Or we can get 96% if criminals out of this country, and keep them out with a wall for that much.
They are going to dig under Trump’s fence.
Who else came to the comment section to see what stupid fights people are going to get themselves into?🤣
That is the best wall design we’ve seen and it’s better than the shitty fence we have now, that is a very small amount of money for a project that has been needed for a long time, this man is just making it look like a lot more money than it is for the government, we are in trillions of dollars of debts so this small amount of money that we need will not harm us as much as benefit us. It’s time to start protecting our own country instead of helping other countries
Looks like the Trumparmy came.....
all the dislikes are from donald trump supporters
How about 5.7 billion worth of wall?
or you could... you know.. buy the wall and save taxpayers a huge financial strain caused by illegals
Maybe if the people of Flint didnt waste their taxes by allowing it to be wasted by people who live off government programs theyd have clean water. But no. Those dummies cant budget. And ya know what? I shouldn't have to pay for it
Trump just wants to be like China in every way, he always talks about them
Wow look at what the dems give foreign countries so mich more than what america what get for what it needs
Buy fortnite and delete it
About the flint Michigan thing, they received $100 million to fix it and didn’t.
You could buy one 5.7 billion dollar wall
President Trump did right
And what could you buy with the amount of money Obama sent to iraq or Iran ( for me it’s hard to tell) to “rebuild bridges” that they didn’t even use to rebuild.
If this doesn't scream California i don't know what does, on the outside this is a video explaining the cost of things, but on the inside it's completely biased and useless, created only to spark an even further split in our nation than there already is... stick to science and dont pull an NFL on us
Trump is an a-hole
Trump see this
Wow, get me a guy who knows anything about the wall besides the cost because that's literally all this guy has down. Maybe you could make a video on how much you could buy with the 40 trillion we are putting into free cheapskate healthcare for all? You know, to be bipartisan
That's how many likes i have on my newest video
Can we please get rid of this debt?
It was a good run ASAP, but i think the time doesn't stop
Bye "Science" channel, it was fun
wow.
Oh yeah I remembered that I'm unvaccinated




Cya guys later I'm surprised I'm 12 years old
Can you do a video on how much u can spend with 30 billion dollars. How much money obama gave to iran
Or you can buy a nice house and supply for your family
The lives of people killed by illegal immigrants
I want the Wikipedia thing
How much do illegals cost a year though? It's not money out of thin air.
Worth it
Or we could use a physical barrier to stop criminals from coming into the country via land because if you can get in legally why should you have priority over the others that are waiting
This is not science. Walls are proven effective. You don't complain when Democrats spend hundreds of billions on useless/counterproductive things. Ideologue.
I WANT ICE CREAM SANDWICHES
So wikipedia needs 69444 dollars a day in order to work ?
What could you do with 56 billion dollars that  illegals immigrants cost tax payers each year....just multiple this video by 10!
How is this science?
Make another one that says “what you can buy with 20+ billion dollars” (the amount of money the US economy lost because dems won’t agree for the small amount of 5 for the wall)
...
You could build a lot of transgender restrooms.
this is so stupid not how our policy works
Or it costs less than 1% of what the US spends on illegal immigrants per year, but nope, they don’t talk about that
What I love about science is there is typically little to do with opinion, and more with actual phenomena of the world. What happened to the interesting unanswered science questions that I used to love? While scientists are often left-leaning, science is at its heart apolitical. Introducing politics into a science channel is not only polarizing, but also self-inflicts a wound that is unlikely to recover. Unfortunately, after being a sub for >4 years, I'm going to have to unsub. Best of luck AsapScience, hope to see your videos in my suggestions some dsy.
Anarchy anyone
Oahu’s railroad was 9 bill and nothing happend and it wasn’t a big deal and nobody had to not get paid so
You really had to throw an anti trump joke in there?
Great, more lefties videos
Oh
Lot of hookers
Look how much Trump can do if he didn’t make the “WALL”
Obama gave away enough money to build 30 walls to terrorist but, I see no one cares about that.
I'd buy all games in the game store and buy another PlayStation just incase it breaks by accident also buy frozen food incase of being hungry af.
5.7 billion dollars is only a fraction of what the United States sends to foreign countries to help them in wars. Since when was America more concerned about other countries' safety than its own?
Now my favourite science channel is going political? Great.
Or you could just secure a border.
I don’t understand why people hate trump so much about this wall. I don’t agree with how trump carries himself. He doesn’t have much common sense but, 5.7 billion is not a lot of money to the government. Obama spent anywhere from 1 trillion - 9 trillion and he had a government shutdown for 19 days. I don’t think government shutdowns are good but, I mean come on, look at the facts.
there are only 2.5 milion kids in the world, wow!
That’s not even that much, bill gates has like 80 billion
I would build a wwwwwaaalllllll
Sounds like a leftist pushin for hand outs to bad that don’t work in the real world and would ruin the economy
Make America great again
That's a seriously misleading heading. 5.7B isn't "Trump's Wall Cost", it's the amount he's asking for, right now, for a down payment. The cost of the wall he describes is estimated anywhere between 20 and 70 billion dollars.
Unsubscribed
College education :(
Build the wall
Can you make another video on what we could buy with the 155 billion dollars immigration cost the USA annually?
Cool video, but it fails to mention that those deaths from tuberculosis are for the world, not in the United States.  Very misleading.
Now imagine how much $730 billion can buy.
Science channel should = Science. This is not science. Don't go all Bill Nye on us and make us not want to watch anymore.
well it’s actually $20B but that probably doesn’t make it much better
Or you can buy a frickin wall and keep America safe. How about that?
Ok I’m out, all these Trump supporters are giving me Ligma
I would buy 14,285,714,285[.]714285 copies of shrek (yes i calculated that for your info)
I can’t believe how irrelevant this is.
You know what you could do with your money? Donate it all to charity and stop posting videos because of the damage the electricity it take to make and run them does to the environment.
Also irrelevant, right?
Your reasoning makes very little sense in the context of national security. 5.7 Billion dollars is a lot, but worth it when it come to protecting this nation. If people want to be Americans, they are welcome to seek proper asylum or citizenship the legal way. Crossing the boarder should not be an easy task, it should be extremely difficult to prevent illegal entrance further harm to society. Illegal immigrants do not have the right to our nations protection, money, handouts, and benefits.

That was quite the rant, lol just needed to get that out. ;)
Thank God we’re getting that wall up. We’ve got to get these illegal immigrants out of our country. Damn libtards are trying to turn the country into hell. Thankfully we have Mr. Trump as our president.🇺🇸
Compared to how much money we make, this isn’t even much
#trump2020
Trump's idea is really bad. With that money, we could look to end world hunger.

Edit: Notice that I want to say that we could start with not much money. We all start from nothing.
5.7 billion can only vaccinate 2.6 billion people? Wdf never knew they were that expensive
Free stuff? (Right.) <----- vote
Now, do the $155,000,000,000 we would save EVERY YEAR when the wall stops illegal immigration.
our governments yearly budget is 3.8 trillion dollars. 5.7 billion is 0.15% of our yearly budget. that’s like the same as ur parents buying u an expensive pair of sneakers. it’s a lot of money to us yea sure but to the government it barely makes a dent. if ur yearly income is 100k, it’s the same as 150$. just 1% of the governments budget is 38 billion. our government could buy roughly 6 and a half walls before it amounts to 1% of their budget
Well unless my math is wrong the wall takes up about .13% of the us budget for this year, and this government shutdown sucks so I think we should just fund it although the wall wouldn’t do much but it would end the shutdown and get people paid. I think the wall is stupid but I don’t like seeing some of my friends getting evicted.
You could feed the poor
liberal sheit
The US brings in 41 trillion a year in revenue. It's like Trump is asking for money to buy a new skin and his dad said his grades weren't good enough.
You could buy 11.4 billion frosty's from Arbys atleast.
You could get 5.7 billion loaves of bread
What about the $150 billion lost to illegal immigrants every year.
Trump could pay off his taxes.
This is stupid. If you want to argue against the boarder wall then show why it is not worth it for the USA. You could make the same argument for literally anything the government spends money on.
Fun fact did you know before Donald Trump became president we spent 200 billion dollars on the gate program with a Obama
The us will lose more on not having a wall within a few dozen years. And also, do remember that a virginia class submarine costs around 6 billion. There are more than 10 of those and none will probably never see action. So what’s more useful, a wall that can help to fight the illegal immigration or another nuclear submarine.
The government is already terrible with money. 5.7 billion is nothing
You could get a whole lot of V BUCKS
You can help the poor people????? Like seriously?
I wonder if Trump realizes that boats exist.
In the big scale, 5billion isn’t a lot of money. It’s like pocket change.
I just have to glance at my brother to find out
Brb, brushing my teeth for the fifth time today

Who else brushed your teeth after watching this
So now not brushing your teeth is something to be proud of ? Wth
I didn't brush my teeth for the first 15 years of my life because I was not taught to by my parent and I only found out brushing teeth was a thing and is considered essential via the Internet and my peers, but my teeth looked absolutely fine. I remember a dentist even saying that they were completely healthy. But ever since I started brushing my teeth I noticed that if I were to skip a few days they would turn yellowish. So idk....
Brush your teeth people not just kids.

So my friend have been brushing his teeth twice or trice a year with active charcoal for almost four years now and he seems fine.
No holes, no cancer
How would you explain that?
Who else was feeling their teeth with their tongue during this 😂
I've not brushed my teeth for a week in the past. 
No bad breath. Not to the extent that isn't combatted with gum at least. Like garlic breath cause i ate garlic.

This is extreme worst case scenario.

Where do bags under our eyes truly come from? What other factors cause them altogether outside genetics and stress? Is there a way to reverse the process or damage of having bags under your eyes? Is there really a cure to rid them outside of plastic & cosmetic surgery?

if this was true our species would be long gone by now
A lot of incorrect ‘facts’ here. Cavities don’t result in gingivitis, bacteria near the gums cause gingivitis. Periodontitis doesn’t happen in everyone, small percentage of the population don’t develop it. In response to the specific systemic complications listed in the video, e.g erectile dysfunction, there is no clear evidence regarding this.

I don't brush my teeth for years. And they are healthy af. (Dentist comfirmed) 
I eat sugar, chips etc. But also drink good amount of water everyday. I think it is genetic all I can say. Nothing to do with brushing or not brushing.
Thanks for all the anxiety.
Watch this and start brushing my teeth halfway through (I was planning on it soon, this just got me moving).
While not brushing your teeth isn't advisable, what's described in this video is worst case scenario and seriously overestimates the possible dangers. Just think about it logically...there are many, many people on this planet that do not brush their teeth regularly or even at all as they can't afford/don't have access to dental hygiene products or even clean water. Billions of people live in poverty. While people in developed first world countries generally have better dental health, if this video were true all impoverished third world citizens would have terrible teeth or none at all, which isn't the case. In fact while in more remote areas of Central America I've met people who've rarely ever brushed their teeth, and they looked just fine. I've also either watched videos or seen pictures of people with literally nothing in places like Sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia and some of them have the whitest teeth you could imagine. Of course these people also eat WAY less sugar than we do over here in the first world, but still. This video is blowing it out of proportion. If you do eat a lot of sugar though or drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, etc. you definitely don't want to skip out on brushing teeth regularly.
This is focusing a bit too much on brushing teeth and not looking at other factors such as drinking water, rinsing mouth after eating, fluoridated water, and regular dental visits (such as for cleanings).

While it's not recommended and not perfectly healthy, but one could get by with little-to-no brushing if frequently rinsing out their mouth after eating or drinking, and consuming lots of tap water and doing it  consuming water, using mouthwash, and dental visits for cleanings/examinations.
this video talked me into  making a dentist appointment this week lol
Thanks guys! :) I want to see a real time video documented lifetime study of whole food vegans vs wf vegan + bivalves, and possibly also keto, carnivore and other fad diets, to demonstrate the long-term health effects, longevity, and happiness quotient of these individuals, who would also be leading active lifestyles and practicing effective stress reduction techniques, and be evenly matched in terms of genetics and initial health status to rule out these extraneous factors.
this video feels very...extreme. and perhaps not completely accurate on the time frames given
Sees 10 seconds of the video”goes brushes teeth 70 times”

How about a video on artificial intelligence? I feel like that would be cool this year maybe it’s just me though ... lol
OMG! this is the best and scariest video on youtube
I feel the need to brush my teeth right now
I watched this as I was brushing my teeth
What happens when we consume all types of drugs at a time... i.e canibus + alcohol+cocaine.... It goes on
All one by one or at a time
thank you for making me brush my teeth
Okay but I haven't brushed my teeth since I was 10
When I was young I  only brushed my teeth twice a year, or right before a trip to the dentist. I wanted to start getting better at it so in 4th grade I really worked to make a habit out of brushing my teeth and a year later got my first cavity.

I found out later when my family moved just before 4th grade that I went form a city that put fluoride in the water to one that didn't, but yeah for a while I wondered if brushing your teeth made things worse.
Thank you for this video
This makes me want to brush my teeth rn
The one who is reading this
Have a nice day mate !
Man, I really need to start brushing my teeth more. I just don't like the idea of doing it. It's not painful and doesn't take long. It just feels like a damn chore. If there was a way to just make it easier. I'll brush my teeth about twice a week. I do use tooth picks to scrape away plaque and pieces of food debris very often, though.
wow that escalated quickly
This made me brush my teeth every morning. Because I always forget
After 30 seconds I went and brushed my teeth.
Erectile Dysfunction eh? 




Now that's some serious trouble. Gotta brush my teeth every hour.
I've never wanted to brush this badly in my life
Sometimes I'm just lazy to brush my teeths 😕😕 especially during winter breaks lol
I haven't brushed in 13 years and I dont intend to start any time soon!
Brb, just gonna go brush my teeth 👍
And what if we never ate sugar or sour things?
Who else brushed their teeth after watching this
I needed to go brush my teeth right after this vid
* Gasps *
I think eventual Erectile Disfunction would be a good motivation for boys to brush teeth 😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure there is some information missing here.

As in other cultures/other times I doubt that they would survive if all that happened after 3 months, Fluoride/alcohol based toothpaste works as an antibiotic to our oral fauna leaving more space for other bacteria to proliferate and interrupting our own body cycle.

I can even say by personal experience that using toothpaste alternatives or non at all will increase the positive fauna in your mouth, I've experienced less buildup and bad breath over longer periods of time.

All this is taking in consideration a low sugar non processed diet and a somewhat strong immune system
We are all so used to brushing our teeth it feels weird when we dont
So this guy I worked with had the thickest nastiest stankest green shit built up on his teeth. It was like hard green calcium build up. 🤮🤮 Wtf was that?
I don't know why but honestly I haven't brushed my teeth for years and nothing happened.
I ha vs not brushed my teeth in a very long time none of this happens
does anyone even brush?
You had me at erectile dysfunction
What if you stopped flossing
Video: When you stop brushing, plaque starts to build up
Me: Okay
Video: Then cavities start to form
Me: hmm okay
Video: It then spreads to your heart, reproductive system and other vital organs
Me: okay.. wait what?
Who else was like scraping their teeth this whole time.
it'd be interesting to know what would happen if you just stopped moving completely (not even to scratch your eye or anything)
maybe no more you in the ending.
Or is you have Asian DNA like me, you only brush once a week and be more than fine. 👍🏼
Hi could you do a video on what if you keep one eye shut.. like i don't know if this is bad?  How long until you damage the other. Ps love your channel!
Do a video on something like a heart attack or stroke.
Good channel, easy to digest info👏
WE NEED MORE SCIENCE!
I haven't brushed my teeth in three years and I'm fine!
nothing happend to me bro
Spoiler alert...





Your teeth falls out
i dont want to be like the other dudes in the comments but i rarely like 1 per month brush my teeth, and even less 4 years ago and thad my whole lifetime(22). but i went every half a year to the dentist  and never had any problems because of thead besides tartar (but i guess everyone gets that)
Question: How and why do hiccups occur?
A relative of mine, never in his life brushed his teeth, he just mouthwashed his teeth with water after eating, he died at 75 years of age, with all his teeth in place and not any significant mouth/tooth disease.
I haven't brushed my teeth in a month or 2
Who else brushed their teeth 🦷 after watching this video 😂
If water is a neutral pH, what would happen if all the water on Earth became an acid/base?
Wow dude. Not gonna lie usually I only brush at night, and even some days I forget to do that. You really do help me to realize I need to start brushing more so thank you so much!
I now wash my teeth 5 times a minute
How much time editing took to create such a great video?  We want to see.
So if that is true, how is that I haven't washed my teeth in 3 years but they are perfectly healthy?
One minute into this and I'm already planning to brush my teeth again
I stopped in 2006 or so and can count on one hand the number of times I have brushed. My breath is not bad, but my teeth are getting pretty bad.
I smoke and I chew tobacco plus I wake up and drink about 2 pots of coffee a day  with ea cup containing at least 2 full spoonfulls of sugar. 
I have some sorta of mental issue which triggered all of this in 2006 and I don't know why or how it started. I have no dental insurance plus I am afraid to go to the dentist at this point. Add to that early onset Parkinson's Disease and a diagnosis of mild Lewy Body Dementia and you end up with a recipe for this kind of behavior I guess. My Top teeth 'look' ok but they had verneers back on 2005 so you can't see what's behind them. Frankly, I am scared that I will lose all of my teeth but in our society today, I don't have many options to pay them 20 thousand dollars!
Not sure why I am 1) even logging in (except to sub) and 2) sharing this, but you guys make my day and I love your videos. Thank you.
Also, thank you for at least letting me know what to expect. My brain is telling me to go brush, it's also stopping me from doing so. I don't know what to do.
So should I brush two times a day
Even serious channels like this have started spreading so much misinformation that I seriously consider stopping getting info from youtube. This catastrophic series of events of not brushing your teeth is pure garbage and does definitely not happen in general.
This is not true 100%
A guy didn't brush his teeth for 32 years, cause he didn't like it.
He had severe plaques on his teeth, but his teeth were still there. He didn't get any other problems apart from his mouth.
After a few check ups at the dentist, his teeth were back to normal
Who needs to brush? Just drink coke your whole life
Became A lazy brusher for A few weeks and A lot of my teeth started breaking.
I wouldn't reccomend it.
Please make a video on food cravings and how to tackle it..😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥



I'm very tired with it.
And also don't forget to eat foods containing vitamin c regularly
All these people talking about not brushing their teeth 🤢🤢🤢🤢 See you in 20 Years when you have dentures.
This is pretty skewed. You can go months to years without brushing your teeth. Brushing your teeth wasn’t for making your teeth healthy n strong, it’s for protecting n cleaning out the bad from our poor diet, aka the introduction of all things sugary n processed grains n foods. 
Your teeth get strong based on your diet and repair themselves based on diet. Colgate didn’t exist in 1200BC. 
If you want to remineralise your teeth, It’s diet, and to rebuild enamel, it’s diet.
this all depends on your diet, water intake, immune system, and genes. some people can go years without brushing and be fine, while some can brush their whole life and have awful teeth. this isn't saying that brushing isnt a good predictor of healthy teeth, but it's weird of them to talk as if there's a 1:1 correlation between not brushing and having bad teeth.
You will have no more teeth, end of story
questioning how my teeth havent completely rotted away by now
I don’t understand how like before we invented toothpaste and toothbrushes we survived then??

WHY DON'T CLOCKS WORK IN SPACE
Why the hell almost every thing causes erectile disfunction 😂😂😂?
i used to only brush my teeth about 2-3 times a year for about 3 years and I've never had really any bad teeth problems. I did start getting tartar after that long so I've started brushing again but no cavities or any of that and i don't go to the dentist. 
people are just different some cant go that long without brushing some can go years without brushing. 
 me saying this doesn't mean stop brushing and find out. Its very important to brush i just got lucky.

It's been a year now..,
Close friend of mine hasn’t brushed his for about 20 years. He’s had literally none of this ever happen outside of occasional bad breath but uses mints for that at times

I know gross but his teeth are in quite good condition otherwise. Especially knowing he runs a chocolate factory
Seriously I was thinking what if there is no gravity between planets who long does it take to die because absolutely the planets will crash to each other then absolutely we will die 😂😂👍

When I was 8/9, I rarely brushed my teeth. I didn't like to do it, I don't know why.
Now I brush it 3 times a day, but they're still yellow.

Who else went and brushed their teeth immediately after watching this video 😂😂😂?
I brush a few times a year. Flush out stuff with water everyday. And floss just about as often. Perfect teeth, though not white, with some yellowish and black. But that's normal I guess, since my father, who brushes everyday, also has black spots.

One bad thing though, is that I think my bottom front teeth can't take it. Whenever I go to the dentist, it hurts when they clean those first four teeth in front. So I guess I should brush more often. Hmph. What a waste of time to brush. :(

P.S. I wipe all my teeth almost everyday with a piece of tissue paper.
...I am officially scarred.
Well I'm now brushing my teeth three times a day after seeing this and barely brushing my teeth
How does warts form, grow and spread? I've always been curious why they're so hard to see for an untrained eye and spread so fast.

Tbh i wash my teeth like once every 2 months
My Story About Not Brushing:
I went 25 years without brushing my teeth (Don't mean to sound disgusting but it's the truth) and i have had none of that at all not even bad breath. I only started brushing my teeth after getting a little toothache and sensitivity on a few teeth while eating sweet things such as chocolate (I did need to use a soft bristle brush when i started brushing though due to never doing it before). My mouth feels nice and clean since i started brushing them but not much else has changed. (I have no black marks or cavities that i know of or anything of that nature, my teeth are slightly stained due to large amounts of cigarettes and tea but brushing hasn't really helped that much.)
How does helium cycle through the atomsphere?
Won't say it's not probable, but I think it has a lot to do with genetics as for how quickly such things progress.  I won't go into much detail, but for approximately a year and a half, during separation from my now ex-wife, I maybe brushed once.  While I did have horrible breath, and my gums receded some allowing for more food to get stuck around the gum line, none of my teeth became loose and my cavities were so few than even when seen by a dentist for a cleaning, they found nothing at all needing action. I understand the need for brushing, but at least be honest about the risk factors.  For reference, my diet during that time was mostly hot pockets, Roman noodle, mandarins, papa John's pizza, and beer.  Not too healthy, highly processed foods, but still not nearly the damage described.
I brushed my teeth after watching this..even though i brushed em in the morning
I've already brushed this day but this video made me want to brush again.
Im unsubbing. This channel has just become fear mongering for clicks for a while now. I don’t remember if this was always the case, but I’m too aware of it now. Not to mention specific sources to push an agenda while ignoring others. It’s a fine strategy in a debate, but I don’t like biased opinion pieces from a science channel. Science is meant to be objective, and you’re just not.

This is obviously only 1 sub, 1 view, and 1 ad only If I’m on iPad, but it’s really just me adjusting what I watch. See ya.
My response: OMG HOLY S***
FRANTICALLY BRUSHES TEETH
I design teeth for a living. Just wondering if there’s a correlation between brushing with your right vs left hand and your teeth decay. For me I notice that I design more teeth in the 1st and 3rd quadrant and more people in the world are right handed. I’m left handed and tried switching my hands and noticed I went from a clockwise motion using my left hand to a counterclockwise motion in my right. There’s no way for me to test this theory was wondering if there’s a way to put it out there somehow?
This is why 

Healthy teeth=Healthy Body

so i've actually heard a lot about dogs and supposedly their saliva can treat wounds. I want to know if this is a legit thing (I don't have a dog or any pet in general so i'm not gonna go off and do this if this is true lololol) and just the science behind the saliva
I brush every few months. And non of these things have happened to me
A couple years ago I would brush my teeth like once in a month or Half a month.

I didn't find this accurate. If you consume fruits and drink water and eat fresh food not fast food process is slower.
I am never forgetting to brush my teeth again.

I OBJECT. ITS ALL LIES I TELL YOU, IM LIVING PROOF. BRUSHING IS A WASTE OF TIME!!!!
So what did people do before 5000BCE? Did everyone just have no teeth?!
Lol im living proof to show this isnt accurate. ive gone a month without brushing my teeth before and i have all my teeth in tact with no cavities.
I love this channel!!!
Looks like a risk worth taking.
What did cave men do?
I am gonna stop brushing my teeth once a day to thrice a day now

Thanks Now I Need To Go Brush My Teeth Now
hey, i know not many people would be intrested in this but i would love it if you explained autism and/or adhd scientifically as none of my friends understant what i say when i try to explain it to them as i have it. i love your videos by the way and i have already memorised the periodic table thanks to you
How can you get cuts if atoms never touch?
Is there a science about drinking alcohol that make you feel different kinds of emotions.  Like tequila making people angry drunk, or vodka making people more sexual, etc... Idk.  Just a thought
I once didnt brush my teeth for like half a year and nothing haplened
Something feels off... I understand that today we consume much more sugar than thousands of years ago, but still, I'm sure early humans ten thousand years ago didn't lose their teeth at the age of... 5?
Anyway, something doesn't add up, anyone care to explain?
Ok i need to go brush my teeth after this.
why am i so cold?
i needed this motivation.
I brush my teeth only in the morning. Anyone else?
I don't really know what your objective was with this video, but alongside the ridiculous worst-case-scenario fear mongering, you've also got inaccuracies.  Cavities don't cause gingivitis, bacteria do.  Yes, eating unhealthy food with tons of sugar in it will accelerate tooth decay, but eating hard foods and grains causes enough friction to break down buildup on teeth.  And if you eat healthy foods, you won't really have an issue with bad breath either since the bacteria feeding on sugars is a main cause of bad breath.  Tooth brushing is an entirely cosmetic invention to manage discoloration (which can't be prevented, it's going to happen eventually with age) and make up for people's garbage choices in food.  Even then, you're honestly better off buying a tongue scraper and flossing once a week than brushing.
Everything that goes on inside your mouth has to do with genetics.  The vast majority of people will not have these catastrophic problems just by not brushing.

You know there's probably some meth head watching this hoping to justify his or her terrible personal hygiene.
I brush my teeth twice a day and floss daily.  My teeth are still stained and my gums look like they are receding.
My video was on 0.25 for some reason 
And it’s terrifying
I am so depressed that I don't even brush anymore
I must start brushing them 2 times
This doesn't make sense.
1st of all, even if brushing teeth can be traced back as early as 5,000 BCE by the Egyptians, that still means likely JUST the Egyptians (and maybe one or 2 other cultures). Did other cultures have their teeth fall out within 1 year of not brushing?
As others pointed out - animals do not brush their teeth, yet many of them are, if not outright healthy, then at the least adequate enough to live full lives without tooth issues.


There is WAYYY too much suspicion surrounding this video... Perhaps you mean "What would happen if you actively prevented your teeth from getting cleaned and washed even by natural means"? Because some foods naturally "clean" your teeth and drinking water helps rinse them.
The longest I have not brushed is three days.

A bit of an odd request, but if possible, make a video on your brain on dextromethorphan, in varying doses

What if you rarely brush your teeth but regularly use mouth wash? Just curious how the science would change
is toothpaste liquid or solid?
I almost disliked because it made feel so uncomfortable.
Short answer: You get cavities, mouth diseases and they fall out.
The information is not entirely true. Cavities  does not cause gingivitis, bacteries growing in and on the gingival margin does. And enzymes might play a role in periodontitis but the activity of the osteoblasts and osteoclast play a more significant role.

I remember not brushing my teeth for a little over 3 years, never had a cavity or serious issues? I guess it’s because I was so young
Oooh and the symptoms of mental health issues
As a child, until 14 or 15 I only brushed my teeth a few times a years. You’ll be ok

Sir how do you get such great ideas to make videos

Sorry but thats ridiculous, when I used to be on a raw diet in the past I never needed to brush and my teeth were totally fine...come on how do you think that our ancestors managed?

If this was true...Surely thousands of years ago, humans would die before reaching adulthood due to developing these conditions?

You should do a video on the difference between hand broken weed or grinded weed like does it get you higher or burn faster stuff like that
I’m brushing my teeth watching this 😉🦷
So if Castaway were more accurate, Tom Hank's character wouldn't have had A toothache, months into his being stranded on the island. He would have had ALL the toothaches. Then when he made it off the island years later, he wouldn't have had a single tooth left in his head.
It's the holidays and this video reminded me that I haven't brushed my teeth in ages... welp
I brush twice a day, for 2 minutes usually.but once, I brushed for 1 1/2 minutes. Pretty badass.
What would happen if earth stoped rotating
Then why haven't my teeth fallen out
What about cavemen how did they live
Additionally, when hardened plaque (calculus) sits on the teeth long enough, the bone slowly starts to resorb (break down) as part of the immunes systems response. So OVER TIME (I never out a number on it because genetics, diet, lifestyle are significant factors that determine how quickly this can progress) but over time, you will loose your teeth. Pockets that measure 1-3 mm are considered healthy. 4 mms and onward would require a deeper cleaning at a dental office and this is purely to save the bone from further resorption and to restore the gums to a healthy state. There are different kinds of deep cleanings they can diagnose patients with and this depends on each individuals case. Hope this was helpful to someone. I work as an office manager for a dental clinic, and for the record we do these types of cleanings more than once everyday... I wish more people knew the true effects, but then dental clinics wouldn't make as much money either. SRPs can be a pretty pricey procedure...
This makes me want to brush my teeth 5 times a day
No, gingivitis is when you become ginger.

How would your teeth fair, if you managed to stick to the diet we evolved for?
Is there any diet under which brushing your teeth is unnecessary?
Or is needed less often, or does not require tooth paste?

He's 14!
I went to my dentist after 15 years of not brushing my teeth and asked them how my teeth looked and they said I can see you brush everyday
What about the ancient people before they got to know how to keep their dents clean? Clearly, humans have been on Earth for hundreds of thousands of years and they didn't brush their teeth until 5000 years ago. Did they develop some kind of immune system that protects their teeth from such dental "decay" process?
This made me want to brush my teeth immediately
Okay okay I will brush my teeth
Um i think im gonna brush my teeth 5 times a day now...
Edit: I went to the dentist and confirmed a large part of these facts are not true. 

Original Comment:
What about all the animals that don’t brush their teeth. My dog has gone three years out brushing her teeth yet she still doesn’t have a single cavity. What did people before we started brushing our teeth do?  Did they lose each adult tooth within a year or two of it coming in.
I never costantly brushed my teeth every day, yet it's been over an year since I last brushed them and they just look bone colour and I have plaque only on the front teeth. Also, the smell I get from things I eat just goes away by drinking water every now and then.
I have braces so I dont have a choice but I guess that is good thing
What if you stop eating any sugar for ever?

For all of you saying that nothings gunna happen, watch it.
I didn't brush for 3 to 5 years as a young teen because of leniency and I was fine. Got older and things turned ugly. Fast foward to the present and I was forced to stay up till 5 in the morning today because of what I'm assuming in the video is an early form of Gingivitis. Or at the very least a wisdom tooth to be taken out.
All in all brush your teeth. Please. I don't want anybody else to experience this kind of pain.

I come from a family of dentists, so watching this video really made me anxious and uncomfortable. Not because of the information, but because there really are people who do not brush their teeth and come in with these issues. My mom and brother talk about them all the time. Since I was a baby, my mother has ingrained it in my head to brush my teeth, so I have never experienced this before, but my other family members have at some point in their lives (ironic, I know, since we are full of dentists, but that doesn't mean the non-dentists take care of their oral health) and they've talked about how painful it is for them to have gone through the procedures. Just brush your teeth and floss.
Within seconds I ran to brush my teeth I have not brushed them in a while soo
Who else ran to brush their teeth after watching this?
Who didn't rush to brush their teeth after watching this because they already do it regularly
Did anyone else go and brush their teeth for 10 minutes straight Bahahahaha

Right your wrongs folks.
Brushing wont stop you from getting cavities if you arent getting enough Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2 and calcium. Type 'Weston Price' into youtube, he is a dentist that visited primitve tribes and found only less than 1% had tooth decay, and these people never brushed their teeth. This is because they were getting high amounts of D3 & k2 from their diet and sun exposure.
Then I think you would stop brushing your teeth
But why is it other animals do not brush their teeth that's not fair :<
Since when did evolution made artificial produce like tooth paste a necessity to survival.
what would actually happen: nothing 


this video is sponsored by Colgate
I haven’t brushed my teeth in a year and every now and then I scrap the white stuff of my teeth but other than that I have never had a cavity and my dentist always says my teeth very heathy so I feel what you said in this video was in correct
Complete BS.  Brushing teeth is something made up by people who thing a mouth full of shiny white teeth is sexy.  Embrace the decay.  Funky breath is savory and sweet all at the same time.  You don't need teeth to munch down on tender baby back ribs do you???  Exactly!
You are now breathing manually
This is definitely extreme cases lol. Cause yes I know this is gross but I went from age 6-19(13 YEArs!)without brushing my teeth at all and got my first cavity ever at 22. My dentist always said I had really healthy looking teeth but I needed to floss. Im 24 now and I look back in disgust but I do now so that’s what important
and how men live before the invention of toothpaste
What’s if you only used listerine?
Well I'm scared straight

I wonder how the aboriginal people survive without a toothbrush. This can't be true!
I'm going to go brush my teeth now...
I havent brushed in 2 weeks
I feel like this is pretty absurd. I remember as a kid I totally went without brushing my teeth for months, and probably irregularly did it for years. I had cavities now and then but nothing like what this is describing. I definitely didn't lose any teeth. I'm not saying don't brush your teeth but this definitely sounds like a stretch.
Ok but like I haven't brushed my teeth in like 3 years and I have no cavities lol what is this bullshitto

I didn't brush my teeth for a week when I left the country and not only did my teeth feel gross but I got a painful bump in my lip on the inside. Wasn't worth the convenience of not brushing.
I have the best oral care and my teeth stay yellow. My dentist says the biofilm is ideal and to not brush it away. Also, if you dont brush that is fine as long as you dont consume carbohydrates or sugar. Im full keto, ripped and teeth are healthier than those who have full white teeth and dying enamel from all the chemicals ised to dye their teeth white.
So what did people use to do like way back in middle ages or roman times?

My burning science question is the arctic circle in 3d must look like a cone projecting into space. So you can fly straight up in 24h darkness but if you fly straight up at an angle how high up would you go and what landmass would you be over to fly outside the arctic cone? Sorry I can't describe it any better. I'd need a pencil
that 1 day  of this vedio is like 1 week and still it's light yellow and never smell, maybe cause i consume lemon juice in the morning
*brushes teeth straight after watching this video.
I would be British
Mate...i havent brushed my teeth since childhood...im alright..execpt for few cavities on my teeth hahaha
This isn’t accurate because I once forgot to brush my teeth for a while and that didn’t happen
I went about 8 years with only brushing my teeth once a week or less. When I went to the dentist for the first time in those 8 years, he congratulated me on having the best teeth he'd seen that entire day, and said to keep doing what I was doing to keep them healthy. He assumed I brushed and flossed all the time. I don't. People tell me I have a perfect smile and I've never had a single cavity my entire life. I think I'm just an extreme case, cause I eat nothing but junk food, sugar, carbs, and other garbage, and still, perfect teeth. If that's gross, so be it, but chances are if you've had even one cavity, then I'm still doing better than you and I don't try whatsoever. I'm still recommend people brush their teeth because I don't know why mine are perfect.
What do u use for animation..
funny when i was a kid i never brushed my teeth. the only times is when the dentist did it for me and that was a few times a year and i never got anything except for some cavities and a silver crown.

What is the history of dental care...?
Show this video to your kinds in a few years and just let then choose their path.
Ima go brush my teeth now...
What I don’t understand, is did this happen to people in for example 200 BC? Where ‘brushing your teeth’ wasn’t a thing as such? How did they manage?
Great video! But getting cavities doesn’t lead to gingivitis, they are 2 completely separate processes, which happen independently of one another, although both caused by the bacteria in plaque!
When i have kids i will show them this video
I brush my teeth twice daily, yet I ended up having nine cavities and one fallen tooth. However, there's people who spent years without brushing their teeth and have a perfect smile and no cavities. How do they do it?
Who else went to brush their teeth after watching this
Answer me this then why are my dogs teeth whiter than mine when he's  never brushed them in his life and i try to brush twice a day
This video is full of lies I brushed my teeth my entire life  (I'm 17)for just few times  and got only one tooth that has little decay
 and my parents never brushed their teeth  neither did my old asf relatives and none of them got that "neck cancer"
I wonder what it would be like for early humans. Having a low sugar diet and likely more things that naturally scrubbed off the teeth.
It's BC
But about the people during the stone age times? They didn't used to brush their teeth.
Tell me this! What happens when someone goes to Coma. Does the same happen?
So your teeth don't naturally have that yellow tinge?
I have this bad habit of not brushing my teeth. I'm almost 19 now and trust me I can literally count the number of times I brushed my teeth in the last year or two; they are that low. But now after watching this, I'm gonna go and brush my teeth and never gonna skip it again. This was really awful to watch and this whole time I thought the narrator was talking about me.
* rushes into the bathroom and scrapes teeth vigorously with the nearest tooth brush in existential fear*
Just to let everything know, if you own any cats or dogs, their teeth will suffer the exact same without any dental care. I can't tell you how many dogs and cats that come into my clinic for dental cleanings end up with way higher vet bills than necessary than if they at least attempted some sort of dental care at home or had their pets' teeth cleaned more regularly than once every 7-10 years. This is especially bad with small dog breeds such as chihuahuas as they are prone to terrible teeth early on. Please brush their teeth or offer dental chews/treats since I am well aware that even the basic cleanings at some clinics are very expensive and out of some ppl's price range. I'm a vet tech btw.
I know this almost definitely won't be seen but I'd just like to suggest a video for Your Brain on Drugs: Datura or DPH. These are delirients that act on the acetylcholine system in the brain and are actually very interesting.
It completely depends on diet about 4 years ago I stoped brushing for a year. I also stoped eating all added sugar and my teeth while a bit yellow they dentist said they were fine just a bit yellow (I do brush now)
Well I’m now terrified
Is addiction really what we think it is? What would happen if we took away all the technology in the world?
I have one question. What are the chances of getting pregnant in different situations? Like if the man ejaculates during the woman's period, or after 2 days, or the chances for a condom to break, and what types of condoms are the best for no risk. And also, if possible, another question, what is the best way to make pleasure to a girl, so there are fewer chances of faking an orgasm? Thanks, you are the best guys!!
So eating his the problem hmmm
How do we overcome yellow teeth?
Just get veneers
Now I get why my parents want me to brush my teeth everyday.

I might get cancer.

Imma just go brush my teeth now
At one point I barely would brush my teeth each month but nothing really ever happened, didn't  get that yellow at the most part and I'm  someone who eats a lot of sugar so ayyy genetics?
Yum.
after watching this video i went to the bathroom to brush my teeth

Hello Asap Science. My name is Grace and I am such a science nerd and it's my favorite subject in school. The thing is, we are doing geoscience which isn't what you guys normally do. We have warm up videos at the beginning of every class and i would love if you made more videos based around geoscience so we could watch them. the other ones are so boring and long but you guys get to the point with just the right amount of content in your videos. I have been a subscriber since 2012 and I really love you guys and hope you take this into consideration.
Jesus Christ, not brushing your teeth can cause cancer? Gonna fill my mouth with toothpaste and keep it that way for the rest of my life now.
When I was a kid, I only brushes my teeth in the morning. Because I could not be asked to do it right before I hit the hay. I still sometimes forget to now like once or twice a year.
Brb gonna go brush my teeth rn this gave me paranoia
How do I make it a habit to brush my teeth regularly? Someone welp pweez.
I must have good genes, cavities after a month? I haven't brushed my teeth in 26 years, I've had 2 cavities on my molars 10 years ago which have been fixed.. nothing since. I still use mouthwash though, maybe that's why.
What if you clean your teeth too much??
So how the hell did humans survive in 10 000 bc???
I don’t think this is true. This is pretty overstated. Ancient humans may not have had teeth for long but one year is way too quick.
Uhhhh I wanna go brush now
Then actually what used to be the case with early human i mean they didnt use to brush right ?
stopp eating sugar and fats everyday and combine it whit teethbrushing and your teeth will thank you

Why does this want me make me brush my teeth
I had a high school teacher that admitted to never brushing her teeth and saying her dentist said she had perfectly healthy teeth. They looked healthy too.
when did this particular species of bacterium find our way into our teeth/mouth area?  Surely we didn't have our teeth falling out quite so readily in the time before cleaning our teeth with twigs became common. Is there anyway to destroy these colonies of cavity causing bacterium and prevent their reinfiltration.

What our ancestor did when there is no brush and toothpaste
I’m ashamed to say this but I used to not brush my teeth, NONE OF THIS HAPPENED!!! MY TEETH JUST TURNED SLIGHTLY YELLOW! AND IT HAD BEEN MONTHS Since I BRUSHED MY TEETH! This was kinda dramatic...
.....oops
I wanna go brush my teeth now
That's what I thought: you made this video for parents to show their kids.
I was in a crash and was bed bound for 20 months. after 3 I gave up on everything including stopped brushing I went from 12 stone 6"1 so standard weight to almost 17 stone  lots of crappy food but month 20 my leg (reason I was bed bound) was amputated and I went to the dentist expecting it to be Armageddon in there and they said everything was fine no problems what's so ever. I brush now but I'd really like to know why nothing bad happened. very confusing.

How did they do in the ancient world?

Thanks for a video to show kids who won’t brush their teeth. Also, I’m scared now if i don’t remember to brush my teeth for day that I’ll end up having my teeth falling out.
So...Oliver Queen didn't brush his teeth for two years on the island, but somehow when he got back, his teeth were nice af?

Why do we grow my hair in different places as we get older, like longer nose hair or ear hair?
i haven't brushed my teeth since my teens, i am now 56 & still have all my teeth. they are so strong ,that i can hold a bag full of groceries with my teeth, & use them to grip & twist off bottle tops !  a close relative used to clean his teeth every day, by the time he was in his 40s they had all rotted away. so, what does that tell you about toothpaste being good for your teeth ? it tells me it's all a load of hogwash & is just an excuse to make money out of making, selling, & brainwashing the public into beleiving ,that they absolutely must rely on a product that no one realy needs, or that even makes teeth decay faster, probabbly so that dental surgeons can also make more money! it probabbly all started as a money making scheme, worked out by dentists & some freinds who where manufacturers of personal hygeine products as a way of making their fortunes, & maybe also to find a use for a mineral that,originaly, had no known useful purpose (flouride).
Why do men bald and women dont?
Bogus
But I brush my teeth twice a day but I have five cavities and a root canal while my brother never brushes his teeth and eats more sweets than me and still has never had a cavity. Brushing regularly doesn’t always lead to cavity free teeth. I don’t know, some people are just born with having immunity from cavities.
Can you get rid of tar tar if you brush enough and how long would it take to get rid of it
Hey guys. How our ancestors dealt with this problem without brushing their teeth?

That Ren and Stimpy episode.... shudder
how did pre modern man and animals keep their teeth clean without brushing?
Hi
How can animals have their teeth then ? I always wondered.
What kind of evolutionary fail was our teeth.
What happens to the teeth of animals? They don't brush their teeth. 🤔🤔
shouldn’t have started this while eating welp bye see y’all later I’m gonna throw ul
Time to go brush my teeth...
well, i'm addicted to sugar and yet i rarely ever brush my teeth (maybe once a month at times) I've had a lot of trouble with self care and ive always been bad about hygeine, but honestly, i barely ever get cavities and my teeth arent even very yellow, i have no gum or tooth diseases either.
I'm 20 years old and ever since I can remember my dad hasn't been brushing his teeth and just last year he had to go visit a doctor because of pain, they did look awful tho
Why do other animals not have to brush their teeth?
I have stayed a considerable ammount of months without brushing my teeths, and I didn't had  no bad breath, my teeth are  all there stronger than ever and even I can say that they didn't look dirty... I think that it all depends on the diet, and your personal hygiene....
I don't believe your teeth would decay that quickly. How could nature be so poor, why even grow teeth if they are going to fall out in a year. Tooth brushes and tooth paste as we know them are a new thing and many people still wouldn't have them. While the oral high gene would not be good I don't believe they all loses their teeth a year after they get them.
I only brush my teeth like once a week because im lazy
Are there any other side affects in asthma? I’m asking because my grandpa has it
So that’s how u become a zombie
brush your teeth unless you never eat sugar
I know a kid at my school who doesn't brush his teeth at all and his teeth are black not there or are decayed to the point of being triangle shaped
not everyone's teeth are the same, I some times skip brushing once or twice a week and my dentist says my gums are in good health, my mom doesn't understand it she brushes twice a day sometimes three and my teeth are better then hers
hey parents, your young one giving you a hard time because they won’t brush their teeth? just tell them:
if you don’t brush your teeth, you can get cancer
My mom wasnt much of a brusher. But you know, she had perfect white teeth, even the dentists were jealous of her teeth. She never drank any acidy type drinks; she was old fashion when it came food.
This video is completely wrong, the efects You speak about only appear un some cases and for much more extended periods of time, not to speak about the things that You eat, I spent my childhood barely ever brushing and I am fine....
I'm started getting into the habit of brushing my teeth again last month, but before then I like did not brush my teeth for 5 months and the worst was a little bit of yellow tint, and a little bit more smell that was barely noticeable. These situation in the video seem a over exaggerated
Then how did early humans survive?
I haven’t brush my teeth in years and my teeth haven’t felll out but the rest of the stuff has happen
My entire childhood i never brushed my teeth, my parents never taught me. I occasionally went to the dentist but my parents stopped taking me after i was 12 or so. I had an awful diet too, mainly cookies and chips. I had like 20 cavities when i finally got my teeth examined but i feel lucky i didnt get infections/cancer or anything like that
How did the ancients keep their teeth, then?
Hmmmm honestly man I don’t brushed my teeth periodically and only brush every once in a while, honestly the only reason my teeth haven’t completely destroyed themselves is because i munch and crunch ice ALL THE TIME, but like actually tho I get a cup of ice like every day and crunch that bad boi. I never have cavities at the dentist either, I try to brush my teeth but always forget. So either brush your teeth or chew ice...
I havent brushed my teeth and a while ( a year or two) (I know im a horrible person dont be mean) but my teeth aren't yellow I've never had a cavity, and I dont have sensitive gums/him disease, so what does that mean?
Look at how bad this guy makes it sounds if you don’t brush your teeth lol
Well if your diet consisted of fruits vegetables proteins and water then not brushing your teeth for a year wouldn’t even be that detrimental to your health. Maybe some plaque and a cavity or two
what an incredible paranoic bullshitt .
My grandma is lucky she has one of those fake teeth she can just take out and rinse under some water
wait... you nee to brush your teeth?
Has it always been like this?  What about before humans started brushing their teeth?  And, for that matter, why don't other animals suffer similar effects, considering that they never brush their teeth?
Why are  humans the only mammal who voluntary brushes their teeth? Why doesn't our natural saliva organically clean our teeth? Pros/Cons from constant exposure to chemicals in toothpaste?/Effects from toothpaste on the oral immune system? Are we sacrificing "evolution" for "longevity"?
I'm 13 and the last time I brushed my teeth was wen I was like 2 and I've only lost 1 tooth
I chew tobacco and brush my teeth rarely and have a bad diet and i have whiter, straighter teeth than anyone i know please explain.......?
ok, so brush your teeth then
This video is extremely overexaggerating.
um.... how did any of us survive? how did any animal survive at this point.
I brush my teeth every day 2 times, and floss and EVEN clean my tongue but i still got really bad breath! Please someone help me!
Usually I try not to comment on these but unfortunately this is all wrong, well at least for me... I practically never brush my teeth. Sure I get some plaque but the dentist says there isn't anything wrong. I have never had a a single cavity in my life, and have not regularly brushed my teeth in over 5 years. My teeth are no less white then the average Joe,  and I dont experience any mouth issues. Why  is that @asapsciance?
does the color of your toothpaste affect the color of your teeth?
I never brush my teeth
Please can you tell me what happens if a person gets the wrong blood type in them?
What about people before toothbrush and toothpaste? Were they all toothless?
brushes teeth
This made me think of when I was younger and over the summer I’d forget to brush for weeks at a time because I didn’t have a consistent routine in the morning/afternoon, it wasn’t until I got braces that I actually got good at brushing
When i was a kid i never brushed my teath and this didnt haapen
how we can make  a camera which can see through wall.Do you want them to answer? Just reply and like
Who is showing this to their kids?
I’m I the only one who went to brush their teeth after this 😂
I’m scared now
Flossing is more important and mouthwash are more important.  Brushing doesn't do shit but make sensitive teeth hurt.  THAT IS HOW IT IS WITH MY MOUTH.  Believe me i tried to go back to brushing but its nothing but pain.  Im not saying brushing is bad, im saying its bad for me.  Everyones mouth is different.
This video can't be true. How do you explain the fact that I NEVER brush my teeth, yet I never has a single cavity in my whole life? Sure, my breath is stinky, and I have plenty of tartar, but none of the serious complications mentioned in the video. How can anyone convince me to brush my teeth when I don't see any negative effects of not doing it?
Dislikes from people that dont brush their teeth
runs to brush their teeth
Eww 😷 got it. Remember to brush teeth twice a day. I forget to brush at night because I get tired and fall asleep, but I’ll try and brush before I get too tired.
Those who do not wash their teeth are lazy... simple
Lol my teeth are like permanently darkish yellow due to an inncident that happened when I was a baby
This is really over exaggerated.

😓
What is an itch? Cause they just kinda pop up outta now where like what heck get outta here
Ugh when I was little I barley brushed my teeth and so now they are yellow :(
And how bad were neanderthals teeth then?
How people survived without brushing their teeth?
Then how did humans survive in the early days before they invented toothbrush and toothpastes
Brb gonna go brush my teeth now
Once I forgot to brush my teeth for 4 days straight!😷
wow
Just use mouthwash lol
Honestly this video is ultimately scare mongering. Sure there are people with poor oral health who will experience these issues on this scale and time frame. Ultimately though this is not the case for most people. Multiple studies show the average American only brushes their teeth once a day. Since this is the sort of study that requires a certain degree of good faith, none of these results are entirely reliable and likely many reported inaccurately. This being the case it is reasonable to assume that a large majority of people (especially keeping these comments in mind) may brush their teeth much more rarely. I know upon speaking with my dental hygienist friends that they have a large number of clients who rarely if ever brush their teeth. If this is such a common occurrence then why are the results of this video not more prevalent? That would be because this video is an extreme exaggeration of the detriments of not brushing and an inexcusable addition to a channel that is supposed to be rooted in science and facts.
Couldn’t you just use mouthwash and floss to stop a lot of this
Really? I don't remember brushing my teeth in a long time but the only thing that happened is my teeth became a bit yellow
If you had a feeding tube, thereby, nothing past through your mouth, would this still all happen? There would be no longer any sugar, etc. to be broken down by the bacteria, so could this still happen?
Or is it to people that don’t go to the dentist
can you do a video on how teeth turn yellow ? & if it is healthy or not ? i brush my teeth every day , drink coffee about once a week , and im under 21 years so i don’t drink wine. my teeth are still pretty stained & i wanna know how to whiten them naturally & healthy.
I brush my teeth twice a day, it would feel so weird if I stopped. My brother doesn't brush at all and his teeth are now rotting.
Somalians don’t brush their teeth
Whos watching this cuz they r lazy and havent brushed in a few days and want to see the damage theyve already done
I’m 8 and I don’t have cavities. Kids get cavities at 6 or 7.
Its %30 lie. I tested it for at least one year. Not smell bad, there is no any hole in my teeth, it doesnt bleed and fall out. I hate sugar, chocolate etc. so i couldnt see that things.
So I'm not gonna lie I don't brush my teeth very often and when I do my gums start to bleed can I fix that if I brush everyday and would my teeth look better?
If you stop brushing your teeth, you’ll have pennsutucky’s ones
My teeth always yellow

The trick is to not use fluoride toothpaste or treatments . Itll wreck your teeth, dont buy into the bs.

Why do not animals have these problems?
Why don't animals need to brush.
yaa
What about animals?
Then how did early human had teeth. They definitely  would not have brushed their teeth. How does animals teeth dont go through the same things?
Ik this prob sounds disgusting but I don’t brush my teeth everyday like usually I’ll just brush them at night but some nights I fall asleep without getting all ready for bed and I have never had a cavity (knock on wood)
Ho do animals live
Here's a question I can't seem to find a comprehensive answer to anywhere. What causes itchiness? Most places just cite "irritation", but that's not really a definitive answer. Why do we feel the need to scratch an itch? What does scratching an itch really do? What causes a place to itch in the first place? Just stuff I'd really like to know, especially as someone who suffers from eczema.
so I don’t brush often at all, and now I’m scared
🎅🏿 I NEVER BRUSH I LIVE IN 17 Medici court maryland
what about animals? they dont brush theyre teeth and theyre fine why would evolution make our teeth rot if we dont brush pls explain
But Small Child dont brush.....
Animals don't brush how do they survive
Can I ask why our bodies evolved to have such weak teeth that need to be brushed? Like you said, humans have been brushing for thousands of years, but we’ve been around for hundreds of thousands of years, so did all our ancestors have no teeth past the age of 3?
Wow I could die if I don’t brush my teeth?
But animals?
Why
Guess who’s brushing there teeth right now
Yikes

Tooth brushing was pushing forward by the mafia to damage your teeth. Stop eating sugar and you should be fine not brushing your teeth. You will never have decay or bad breath in your life. Just clean it once and awhile when you go somewhere important.
What if you stopped blinking
Lol the haters
I didn't brush for a couple of weeks and had a *lot* of plaque but for some reason, my teeth aren't yellow? even when I was a little kid I often forgot to brush and had like 8 cavities but my teeth never turned yellow, why?
head and neck cancer ?
So is this what happens when we die?

How come animals like cats and dogs dont develop these diseases?
Ok how often do you brush your teeth? Be honest.
Why dont animals have to brush their teeth?
Interesting... But teeth brushing is a very new concept. How, then, did primitive humans survive these diseases?
I Haven’t Brushed my teeth for 5 whole Months and never got any Plaque at all. But I Mostly eat Dairy products. And I don’t smoke.
What does it mean when toothpaste makes your teeth turn to a crumbled chalk-like substance, making your teeth fall apart and fall out? That is what happened to my mother and is now happening to me. If I stop brushing them, my teeth stop crumbling!
Have you watched a youtube video about a man who didn't brush his teeth for 20 years? Named "20 Years Without Brushing Teeth"

i mean the biggest population of people who doesnt brush their teeth are chinese and vietnamese some western europeans (COUGH COUGH british) and indians and latinos and africans


i guess they doing fine tho tbh
How does whistling work?
I didn't brush for most of my life, with no issues whatsoever. My issues only started after I started eating sugary things and drinking sugared drinks on a daily basis. I'm not saying the video is wrong, but it's certainly inaccurate -- you can live quite a long time without brushing so long as you don't eat any sugar, and not too much meat.
Who got motivated to brush their teeth.... just me? ok
A lot of exaggeration ,
Can you make a video about Cyclical vomiting syndrome please
When I was younger I didn’t brush my teeth for months at a time and I only ever had one cavity and I never had any problems with my gums

Do a video on CBC edibles
Can you talk about genital hygiene?
I’ve found not flossing ever eats away at bones in your jaw from bacteria
Most of the points, if not all, are pinpoint scientifically accurate. all the critics either have better genes or a diet that does not inflict serious damage to teeth. Great work guys! You summed up for us a horrifying possibility in just 3 minutes of viewing pleasure.
Watch the video
Well no I know how people I the 1600 feel
cavities do not lead to gingivitis. gingivitis is inflammation of the gums, cavities involve the tooth itself. gingivitis will in time progress to periodontitis if left untreated.
cavities also do not fill with pus. when a cavity becomes deep enough to involve the pulp, in time it may lead to abcesses and pus formation.
PLEASE be careful when posting things like this. it is unfortunately not researched well at all.
Why if we were a lot taller?
Always thought that brushing teeth is a common part of life until I read the comments.
To all  the people who haven't brushed in years: WTF!!! brush you teeth!!!! Like just because nothing too bad is happening now doesn't mean you shouldn't maintain proper dental hygiene. A tooth brush and some tooth paste ain't that expensive y'all.
This video is 3 mins long. Like the time you should brush your teeth but... Who really does? 😅
I wanna see a video where you compare vaping harm to cigarettes harm

Can we see Will naked?
I need to go brush my teeth now ....
What happened if don’t go to bathroom for a week?
Can you explain why it sometimes appear as if shadows are pulling each other
As a child, I refused to brush my teeth simply because I found mint toothpaste vile and the child friendly bubblegum flavoured ones even viler.

Thankfully, I've always been a fruit fanatic. An apple a day kept the plaque away and I've only ever developed a couple of minor cavities over the course of 28 years.

You really need to account for diet when discussing dental care. It makes a huge impact with regards to your teeth. No doubt this would be what would happen if your diet were terrible, but it certainly doesn't convey its facts very clearly.
Talk about huge design flaws lol
Periodontitis also destroys the bone in the jaw which is why teeth become loose and fall out...  less gum, less bone structure. It recedes back with the pocketing and pockets can be true or false. A true pocket will always stay with periodontitis and can range in mm. any more than 3/4 mm is clear perio disease and I’ve even known pockets to get down to 10mm. Deep cleans are given to the teeth under the gums in these pockets in effort to get rid of the tartar. If you keep pockets healthy and clean perio may not progress however further down the pocket the further less ligament onto the tooth causing mobility... periodontist is not reversible but gingivitis is as long as it doesn’t get too far down the line in bad gum health. 

Just more facts for this video, that’s all.
That's terrifying.
I haven't brushed my teeth in 100 years.
Brb brushing my teeth
lit questions
i think they forgot to add a zero to every number, that doesnt sound very realistic
What happened if I well teach my 10 yr old child  12th psychology please answer me

The trick to defeat T series??
yeah, sure, you know humans didn't use to brush their teeth in the past, right kids? and they had way stronger teeth, animals too
I can smell this video
Hey can we have something about the science of being intersex (I think that’s what it’s called) it just sounds really interesting. Have a nice day :)
Then how do you explain dogs teeth when they have had a bit of sugar
But the real question is, will your partner still want to kiss you even if you never brushed your teeth though?
cavities lead to pulpitis not gingivitis
Yeah, I'll add that I've brushed my teeth very sporadically for the past 7 or so years with no major ill-effects. Before you ask what's so hard about it, or say it's gross, I know. The issue is that when you're too depressed to want to live in the first place, taking care of your teeth is the last thing on your mind.
I'm going to brush my teeth after this video
Why do babies smell so good
I went most of my childhood without being able to brush my teeth normally/never was told how important it was to always brush my teeth. I also wasn't able to go to the dentist for years. Other than one or two cavities and some bad breath, my mouth hasn't gone through all that. The worst it got was in 2013 (the last time i had been able to visit the dentist before now) and they said i had a minor case of gingivitis. I know how important brushing your teeth is and I'm not saying its okay not to brush your teeth, but what is it with all these videos saying if you dont brush your teeth, theyll immediately rot out your head and youll be forever toothless for the rest of your life. Why do   people have to scare kids and other people into brushing their teeth
What happens if u don’t eat?
So if humans stop brushing it's bad news but how do every other animal get around this activitiy... Why haven't we evolved like them?
Basically you'll die if you don't brush your teeth lol

No offence but i think those investigations are old, i know a lot of people who aren't good at brushing there teeth and we all dont have a lot of problems
I didn't brush my teeth for a month at a time in the past and I never started bleeding by touching my gums sorry
I'm from the UK. I know multiple people that rarely brush their teeth, and whilst their breath smells they are not as bad as this. This video is probably to encourage younger people to brush their teeth
Thanks
I’m gonna go brush my teeth
If you get rid of the streptococci from rinsing you mouth with iodine you do not need to brush
Nice
My teeth are yellow but I brush twice a day.  How come animals' teeth don't fall out all the time?
Wait toothpaste was made recently so did everyone have problems back then and not to mention what about animals!!?
Animals don't brush but they don't get such infections
I’m gonna go brush my teeth now...
I’m absolutely disgusted with the amount of the people in the comments who are saying they haven’t brushed in months/Years. That’s nasty.
Why we need to clip our nail or what if we didn't clip forever? @asapscience
I was genuinely thinking about this earlier today, how strange
U had me at erectile dysfunction 😂😂
Make a video.what if every government on the earth banned petrol for vehicles..
Hey how to get rid of plax... Tho I brush everyday I got em....
one can be fine without brushing teeth but dont eat anything that contained sugar which is most from sugary fruits and man made product .
What happens if you never go outside
Is it the same for my dog? 👀
is brushing 2 times a day a marketing scam or is scientifically beneficial?
Bullship! Im not brushing teeth longer than year and its not like in video. Im not telling that is good but definitely not like in video.
then how do animals survive this??
What if you eat as a hunter-gatherer though?
Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.
I'm sure that when the cavemen were alive they never brushed their teeth, imagine the smells
I will show this to my kids if i had one
I don't brush my teeth everyday. But my teeth haven't gotten to the point where the teeth are getting large cavities. I do have very recessed gums, making my teeth look huge.
Hey ! what's the gender of Science ? Is it female ?
So does this imply that humans have always needed to brush their teeth? Even before the technology and infrastructure necessary was introduced? Are you telling me that it is absolutely necessary for humans to routinely stuff their mouths with fluoride to simply keep their teeth. This doesn’t make much sense as I have heard many stories of people who don’t traditionally brush their teeth and are completely fine.
Is their any way to get rid of tartar?
What about animals.

People who suffer from depression and are alone tend to suffer the most during the holidays.
It especially sucks if you’re a criminal (see Home Alone)
A maximum weight gain of 3 pounds? Amateurs.
It’s still better than YouTube Rewind
It do be like that sometimes
Santa Claus wants to know your location

Christmas: Am I joke to you?
When your a kids holidays are the best it's a different story when you're an adult tho
Great job ruining Christmas!
People die it's a good thing U know why?








 
Why are people forced to spend more money around the holidays? People shouldn't feel pressured into doing so. That's where stress can stem from. Be happy with what you do have and what you can afford. The people on the receiving end or lack there of will be ok with that either way. A child can still receive his or her gifts when the parents can afford. It's ok.
Can you guys do one about essential oils? The science of or whether they work?
Well I only sleep in the holidays so it doesn't matter

Dear Santa pls make the 2019 rewind not cringy

We get it , u hate holidays
because santa dabbed on us
I watch old videos of ASAPscience and related youtube channels during holidays (when I am not playing PUBG)
This is why you need to go to Tahiti during the holidays. It's a magical place.
Happy holidays everyone...
COUNT YOUR TRASH
Thank you for ruining Christmas
I don't have to deal with that, cuz I don't celebrate christmas :P
That's why I just don't check my bank account during the holidays
Im 17 and don’t stress too much about it. I feel bad for everyone who does. Chill out, if you don’t like it that’s okay too :)
Stay healthy <3
ofc the dinners, christmas movies and gifts are fun. but for those depressed alone or just having a bad time in life. christmas time is a time of hope and looking forward for a better life in the next year. for me its the only time of the year (besides summer) where i dont feel stressed or anxiety.
Thanks for making me hate the holidays
Well you should make a video on festival of Diwali in India then.😂
This video proved that Christmas may not be “the most wonderful time of the year”.
If im not sick or throwing up, my holidays are amazing
I really feel like Christmas would be better if it wasn't about gifts. I'm sick of this American tradition where it is all about consumerism because buying stuff does not make you happy for long. It's really stupid but I wish this video eased the stress and gave tips on how to beat the holiday blues. It's just didn't help making me think about it more.
If you believe it will work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you believe it won’t, you will see obstacles..
Jesus has left the chat
This is how major depression feels to me. I dont want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep. And that's really sad. It was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you're so relieved. I woke up into a nightmare.
Sis, who’s gonna notice  that you gained .5-3 lbs.,, like....
This channel is so good
Asap: Americans are expected to spend $885 in gifts
Me: I got a half eaten Mars bar from my brother, a picture frame from my mom(no picture inside), and a stack of lined paper from my dad. Beat that
Literally my entire family got the stomach flu on Christmas week, three members of which had it on Christmas day. It was rough lol

Eho realise that the:Seasonal Affective Disorder =SAD is like that?
I personally hate what Christmas and other holidays have become. Instead of being a family gathering now it is all about presents and money. It is all a bullsh*t marketing to sell expensive stuff most of the people do not need so not only we can pollute our planet but also to waste enormous savings on unnecessary objects which are 'supposed' to make us 'happy'. Something is deadly wrong with our civilisation..
This year , I just realised that my family and. I are getting lazier when it comes to finding presents
explain allergies
My mom already hates the holidays and I can't celebrate it without guilt. Now you had to make a vid on it. Thanks a lot.😡
Why are you saying the holidays suck?

Not cool, if you’re stressed about seeing your family then you should stop being fake
Thank you reminding me why I hate the holidays. At first I thought I was just being a snowflake...
My parents said we were too old for Christmas when I was 12 soooo 🤷🏾‍♀️
Holy crap, this dude must go through alot of markers

I feel like I'm the only person who is truly excited around the holidays. Christmas is my favorite holiday simply because I get to see all my family. We don't see each other often so it's lots of fun during the holidays!
Well done. You've covered at least half of my reasons.
And that in a very compact 2:51 video.
Thank you, sir ^^ thumbs up

Wishing you a happy Christmas God bless you
I mean.. 3 pounds ain't that bad.
*Family that overreact during holidays *
Even worse, I don't get my Test Final scores by Christmas. 

Day of Christmas: You failed!
Me: ... ;-;
I live in south Florida so I think I’m good with temperatures.
Christmas sucks in the US because all ppl do is run around and spend $$ they don't have on a fake holiday that's over by 12 noon..by 1pm there are no more Christmas songs playing, it's over...go to the islands where Christmas is a month long and more of celebrating, festivities, caroling, good food and company
Let’s face it 
Now we know there’s no happiness left in this world 





THANKS YOUTUBE!
Can we just go cold turkey with what hurts our earth; use less pollution. Yeah, people will use excess of whatever is in thier home and may learn to change. It's a start. The fact we use so much non-biodegradable plastic in everything is nuts.
anyone else heart randomly start hurting
Hey! The holidays don’t suck! Let us enjoy our holidays!

On the other hand, I agree that all forms of alcoholic drinking is bad, which is why I never drink alcoholic beverages, and the money aspect of the holidays do suck.
Because I have to do homework instead of enjoying the holidays
That's why
Thanks for ruinign Christmas, Grinch! I would say Jack Skellington, but you don't deserve being called my favorite Christmas characters!
cant relate because I live in Australia and it isn’t cold
In my country, you can already hear Christmas songs being played in malls and radios on the first day of September. And since we’re prone to typhoons and storms, especially from September to December, a lot of families here are victims of natural disasters. But people who weren’t affected would actively give aid to the victims especially when it’s almost Christmas...

EDIT: Just wanted to share that even though a lot of people are stressed out from the preparations of Christmas, there are also others that despite being tired, are willing to give aid and serve other people. Knowing that Christmas is about caring for others, being generous, showing kindness, and also being grateful and contented.
That explains a lot. I have a good pattern going to reduce stress during the holidays, thankfully. :)
I always get sick during the holidays😭 I’m sick right now and I have a stuffy nose and everything is achinggg😭😭
every x-max vlogs are better than the youtube rewind 2018
During the holidays I lost more than 4 pounds :'((
You can’t say « the uk uses enough wrapping paper (surface) to go around the equator 9 times (lenght) »

If you have 1 square meter wrapping paper, you can go around the equator 9 times (~360 000km) by cutting it into stips that are 2,78 nanometers wide

I should stop taking this channel seriously but there’s « science » in the name
Literally me every Christmas:

Okay let's turn the holiday season into goddam global warming PROPAGANDA.
Okay! we get your atheist already, we get it.

Thanks for putting the kg next to the pounds! :)
Did anyone notice the online shopping store scamazon?
It is because I got sick last Christmas
Amazing present I know
Good thing I avoid most of these by crocheting presents for my friends and family and make them practical in everyday use. Also, it feels much more full filling to learn a skill and gift someone with something so personal like a handmade gift
I hate holidays. I feel more depressed that ever before

I didn't eat anything this Christmas I feel sick because of the noise around... :D

I hate holidays

Especially Christmas
As long as the old lady gives up the pooper I’ll have a good holiday👍🏿
Omg ikr literally everyone around me is sooooooo sick in my school and I got sick about a week ago and I am still sick.....ugh holidays
That's when you're glad you don't partake in Christmas craziness. It's just a time to chill out and spend days on end switching pyjamas and discover new recipes ! (And still work a lot bc well, you're a teacher)
0:29 Well that doesn't mean anything, if I've got a wrapping paper with the thickness and length of my finger, I can just divide it x many times which would make it eventually go around the equator of the Earth
S C A M A Z O N
Nobody noticed this?
Good video, tho I suffer from seasonal affective order for about 5 months! During holidays I can actully come to terms with it.
Christmas has left the chat 😳
Can you do a video on the effects of working third shift (at night)?
You only gain 3 Lbs during the holidays? Amateurs.
90% of Christmas is all about money, worry and stress. and of course, lame cheesy gifts.
Wait, y’all are canadian???
I saw that 20$ at 2:29, not slick!
I took the stress out of Christmas,  I don't exchange gifts
It's sad, but true....Unfortunately, it doesn't be changed
SORRY TERRA FOR THIS

There is always someone who ruins everything!! Great now I'll have guilt!
I'm glad I don't take things that far when celebrating the holidays. I feel bad for those that drink or eat too much and have a houseful of Christmas decorations and probably a truck load of gifts. Jeez...
I sleep a lot during the holidays 😂😂😂
I LOVE ASAPSCIENCE !! ♥️
You forgot about the mass of people who euthanize their pets after the holidays :/
Great selection of studies, though including seasonal affective disorder might have been conflating different meanings of what we mean by holidays.  Can you do a video on why the holidays can rock?  Thanks!
Thanks for understanding!  Happy Solstice!  Peace and Reason!

What a way to make the most wonderful time of the year into something not so wonderful! Geez! Also you should never get so much stress that you may get a heart attack from trying to have perfect Christmas expectations. In the end it's all about the birth if our savior Jesus, and the love our family brings together! Just do Christmas the way you want to. Don't make it so complicated, and hard on yourself, make it a fun and memorable time you will remember! I have found Christmas to be the least stressful time of the year. Relaxing with family by the fireside or glistening Christmas Tree, no school or work, getting gifts, eating great food! Don't look at the negative parts of life! Have a fun and relaxing Christmas, and a happy New Year! 🎄🎅⛄🎉✨❄️♥️
Are you trying to ruin christmas?
How about stress in the holiday due to dealing with family gathering?
Do gifts always have to be physical?
I hate holiday coz you have nothing to do and your sooooo bored 😐. At least school you to somethings
Should i be worried that all these occur for me daily
SCAMAZON So true, lol
"Scamazon" 😂 good one
Christmas is about giving

And not Liking the presents your loved ones gave you...

Reason 1: People call it Holidays instead of Christmas.
Question for atheists: Why do you celebrate the birth of someone who you don’t think exists?
I just noticed that seasonal affective disorder stands for S.A.D
thanks for breaking the magic haha
Well, atleast I've got my friends
True, especially for  not-a-holiday-fan, holidays can be miserable.
ASAPscience really knows how to bring out the Christmas spirit in people.
i got a relly little presents out of my whole family including cousins
It especially sucks if you were apart of YouTube Rewind.
Most disliked video for views on YouTube.
Just showing once again how out of touch YouTube are from their audience.
never usually this early lol
0:30 can you blame us, our flag looks like wrapping paper 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿.
can you please do a video on the science of being bored??
just get them something from their wishlist, surely they will like those things?
and if they dident send you one, they have no right to complain ;p
why are you only talking about america?
I found that giving 100 dollars as a Christmas present worked very well in 2018
Thank god I hate christmas then!

I just get piss drunk year round instead :)
Did anyone notice that Seasonal Affective Disorder Spells SAD
Good that I study chemistry and though have no holidays!
Boi i gained 20lbs cuz i be blazing up ontop of all that shet
My Christmas sucked bc I was rlly sick and at 7:00 pm I got a nonstop nose bleed that bled for 20-30 mins and I had to go to the ER for like 3 and a half hrs

To much latkes (*dies*)
Or because you have to do family interaction but ok.
Great video! I'd like to see a why the holidays are good next year, thanks!

Question: Could teleportation be possible?
This video neglected to include one of the greatest factors that contribute to dissatisfaction and unhappiness during the holidays ➳ the negative feelings associated with feeling lonely, forgotten, unloved, unwanted, under appreciated, isolated, unconnected was others, worthless, ignored, and rejected.  I should know. That’s how I feel during the holidays.  To make it worse, my birthday is December 19th.
1:48, The acronym is SAD, lol
This is probably the reason y it had been so hard for me to love or even like the holidays. I always hated it without knowing y
Do a Video about Lucid dreaming
Tf y'all doing, I only spent £2 on gifts
i wasnt feeling stressed at all, and suddenly after i watched this video i still fcing dont, Christmas is amazing, i wont let u tell me othereise
You made it on YouTube rewind
My dad had a heart attack 3 days ago😢
when did you start to make such dark content
I still love the holidays!
Luckily, we don't celebrate Chrismas Here
We got a grinch here😂
what branch of science is this?
You can cut that $858 down by buying books for people especially kids. I am an avid reader and have little cousins that don't get great access to books. Hatchet at Target  $8.58 on Amazon $4.50. And most of them are even submitting book requests to me on thanksgiving now :)
Don’t gotta buy gifts if you don’t have any friends to buy gifts for 🤷🏽‍♀️

Why you should drink  water by sitting
Am I the only one who actually lost weight during holidays?
Christmas is a business
ive heard suicide rates spike after the holidays 😔 i wish american culture didnt make such a big deal of having a perfect christmas/new years/etc. it makes  it feel way worse than it should when little things go wrong or you dont have anyone to spend it with
1:19 shut up, I don’t need to hear this 🙉😂
Are readers more likely to be successful in life?
Why Christmas is amazing: we all come together to share with those we love. We sing songs together, and sit by fires to fight off the frigid night. We spend days in a frozen wonderland with our family members, and ultimately, we remember and celebrate the birth of Jesus. It’s the most wonderful time of the year :)
Can u do a science behind achne plz?
Damn just ban all plastic, and replace them with reusable materials.




Ps I barely get feed in Christmas.
It is their own problem , any one can find any excuse to destroy his own life . but now I know how to enjoy Christmas without killing myself . thanks a lot 😍💙

It was my birthday yesterday and I was sick
Why not help people by suggesting ways they could make it more positive rather than harping on about the negatives? Just a thought.
I dare you to speak of this subject in the middle of festivities where everyone is supposed to have fun
Also not having all the family together.
This is the evidence I needed!
Hey remember when this channel was accurate and interesting?
Expecting people to spend $885 on gifts? Ha! More like. $8.85...
My family quit celebrating Christmas about 12 years ago. Haven't missed it yet.  We still buy presents just for little one's but thats it. Teens and adults don't get anything. Then on Christmas we have a very nice dinner with everyone getting to eat their favorite foods. This year we are having a seafood extravaganza with seafood from all over the world. The little one's will be getting their favorites. Tiny burgers with cheese and fries. The teens? We just let them do whatever. There too hard to please.
No mess, no fuzz and no stress.
I just hate getting presents for free
Well I live in Australia and don't celebrate Christmas so I think the most danger it puts me in is loneliness.
that "Scamazon".....
You forgot about the Common Cold and the Flu. because they are so contagious, just one sneeze or a few coughs can infect a few people around you. in the holidays, people spend more time together at Get-Togethers, Parties etc. Especially in parties, the flu and the common cold can jump from person to person really quickly, so basically everyone has a cold or the flu after going to something of that nature.
I am looking forward to your next episode titled „This is why ramadan sucks”
I really hope to see that episode.
I want to start boycotting Christmas/Thanksgiving. They are just wasteful holidays!
Anywho. Happy Holidays everyone!
Scamazon.....dang the shade lol
You know for kids it’s 🤩🥰🥳🤑

For adults 🤢🤮😵
i used to like this channel, but i feel like they are only putting out content to support a left leaning ideology. Kinda sad to see.
What holidays every holiday is just another normal day for me 😔
Why does it always seem like people further to the left are so unhappy compared to everyone else?
Nihilism has entered the chat.
Santa???
Nice try. I know it’s you Grinch
New Years firework displays always rub me the wrong way. Do we really need to literally watch millions of dollars go up in flames when they could be spent on improving the lives of the less fortunate?
Great video! Love your content. Can you make a video about obsessions? Possibly celebrity obsessions and when obsessions turn unhealthy and if they can be healthy? Thanks!
1:20 what does the minimum and maximum mean?
Wait, he's Canadian?!
This is offensive to my religion
I see Adam ruins everything has made it way here
I love Christmas! I especially like how the sun sets at three pm and you can never know what time it is
The holidays are manufactured by forces outside of our control.

Just stop playing the game.  Stop buying things for people they don't need or really want.  Help others.  Don't get sucked into the for-profit marketing you're bombarded with.
Liking this comment will give you good luck in 2019🍀
I get stressed from 0% patience but also from wrapping presents. Idk something satisfies me and my parents when we rip something open. Also recycle your wrapping paper this year folks if you can
I have one question. What are the chances of getting pregnant in different situations? Like if the man ejaculates during the woman's period, or after 2 days, or the chances for a condom to break, and what types of condoms are the best for no risk. And also, if possible, another question, what is the best way to make pleasure to a girl, so there are fewer chances of faking an orgasm? Thanks, you are the best guys!!
All of these are so random
Tradition is powerful.
Ha I'm not spending more than like $50 on gifts this year. Not worth going broke to buy gifts. 😏
Christmas joy? Bah humbug.
Break the Cycle, Morty. Don’t give presents.
I once threw up on cristmas day
Thanks for ruining holidays
This chwistmwas im going to geet my woved wones the N wowd owo
why the holidays suck for adults and children.
Children: they didn't get what they wanted for X-mas.
Adults: the children weren't grateful they spent 1,500 on a shirt for them.
How does it feel like to be in the most disliked video on YouTube( YouTube Rewind 2018
Better to buy yourself something.
How in the world DID ASAP SCIENCE feature in Youtube rewind?
You guys aren’t making as interesting of videos anymore.
If your holiday sucks




Play PUBG
Holidays are awesome!
I need a vacation to get a break from that classroom and get some rest. Everybody wants to swing from the chandeliers nonstop and they expect me not only to go, but drive. I'm exhausted.

I tried to celebrate alone but *sigh maybe next year.
Several years ago my family decided to spend $0 on gifts. We just eat, drink, and enjoy each other's company. It cuts down on the stress tremendously, but we still have the stress of dealing with everyone else.
Carlsberg Probably the best
They suck a lot....Cause I'm stuck with a huge cold
When he was talking about spending did anyone notice on the little screen it said Scamazon? Lol
Amazon = Scam??????
Its SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)
Lol 15% don't like the gift. That's a really good statistic
Saved hundreds shopping during the yearly sales.
I know I m the only one who do know Asap means
...so have a Merry Christmas!
Well this vid just sucked up the fun out of my favorite holiday.
What also sucks is listening to Christmas music for TWO MONTHS STRAIGHT. 
I like Christmas music as much as the next guy, but it would be nice to hear it closer to the actual holiday.
0:15 who else thought it was 1 truck a year
This is why you don't get invited to parties
Why does this make me so pessimistic? I definitely need to filter my YouTube recommendations, internet can literally make you look at the dark side of everything
Easy, spend more money!!! who cares about debt?! valar morghulis!
Because holidays carry a lot of expectations and feel like a very important time of year, a lot of people who have it really hard suffer additionally. It's supposed to be a significant date and you're not supposed to be alone/broke/sick/depressed/homeless/etc. I don't know about the USA but in our country in Europe suicide rate goes significantly up as well.  
So, to anyone who might be reading this... it's just a date. And the day after is another day. You will pick yourself up, just don't stop trying. Screw social expectations, the more loud the emptier they are. So, just hang in and make it through. Because one life is infinitely more prescious than one insignificant date that repeats itself each year. What makes it significant is the way you spend it.
I hate being around people during the holidays
@Asaoscience are you grinch ?
I came here for emotional support
It really sucks because anxiety and seasonal depression. HHHHHHHHHHH
Could you make a video on how Dayquil works or does not work?
I already hated the holidays. Birthday is on the 28th 😠😠
I kinda feel sad, I live in Aussie, it's hot and when people talk about snow it makes me feel sad because ik that I will always have heat but at least I have a pool I guess...
I'm glad I don't pressure myself with that holiday competition, I'll just sit home and eat some salmon (which is even healthy food).
And School days swallow
To me what's important is to pay bills and get rid of debt.
Tbh i always eat a lot , not only in the holiday season
I love Christmas and it never disappoints!! Happy holidays everyone
Maybe we can do an experiment?
I gained about 2 pounds this holiday... but then lost 3 pounds after throwing up with the flu. This is why Christmas can be evil.
When you wake up in the morning after Christmas and have to throw out everything and see that you’ve gained weight
I’ve just realised these people live in Canada
Scamazon😂😂
I never get sick during them but I'm also a starbucks barista inside of a mall in Seattle right next to Santa Claus and that is so stressful
Good I don't celebrate it, so it's not my fault.
welp, funny thing my father just had a heartattack, this hollidays are going to suck sadly
Yep!!!
Have a holly jolly Christmas
Early for once
I think u forgot about the reason for Christmas...
I don’t celebrate Christmas or any holidays at all actually. This video makes me feel good 😁
I gained 10 pounds christmas 2016
So basically Ebenezer Scrooge was right all along
I sucks this year because I'm sick 🙁
It's not holidays ITS CHRISTMAS WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
I work in retail so that's another reason why it sucks
I don't compare myself to others. Life is not a competition (IMHO). My mentality is survival first before this "fun" shit where people kill themselves just to make others happy. Lol troll me. 😘
Merry Christmas
"Scamazon" <3
Christmas needs to die, tbh.
Happy holidays 😁😁
When you got another lego set even though you already have like hundreds of them
Why do all the bi girls like me
I think that just made Christmas a little bit better actually. Less expectations.
Seasonal affective disorder aka s.a.d
I think general society really should stop comparing their lives to others especially from social media, no one is posting their hard times to Instagram only highlights. Just have fun this holiday season y’all. Merr Christmuh.
The real hero of these holidays is the liver
Why not just give up on Christmas and try to be happier year round?
I think picturefit and this are the same
Lol usually these videos end on a good note, but not this time, the holidays are just destined to succ
I have seasonal depression.  I find the holiday season very beautiful and warm, but the lack of sun and constant cloudiness in my area just makes me tired and depressed for the majority of the time.
You just don’t believe in god!
why do the holidays suck...

its always the trash in the ocean, yea
Well you kinda ruined my Christmas
What about being sick?
I got a head cold. Yuck.....
I did not enjoy this video but that is neither here nor there
Seasonal Affective Disorder=SAD
Dang you guys find no joy of anything in life.
I don’t have to worry about getting cold on Christmas I live in AUSTRALIA! WE GO TO THE FREAKIN BEACH ITS THAT HOT!
eh, better than valentine's day, I may be poor and lonely but at least I can appreciate the pretty lights and christmas themed shit, valentine's day is just hell for me
!WARNING!⚠️ Why does 😱 it sucks? 
   <It's "Pagan" 📢😡 Everybody>
dude the weight gain is a serious problem for passover
Also people in cold places are often times more likely to be sick because the spread of love and affection can also brinb the spread of diseases
I think the holiday heart attacks is more than just alcohol. I've always been balls to the wall on the holidays, many drugs with no regard for tomorrow. In fact I plan to do it this December too; hope my mom understands, but this is my life.
Ebenezer Scrooge directed this video
Tell me something I don’t know.
Brokeness. Loneliness. Abandonment. Lack of wish fulfillment.
You should make a video of how you shoot your videos!
haku yi a-ni na he na yi-len na, hoxi ha mamina nen gei bo you jju.
Who in the hell is spending $885 in gifts!? O_O
I hate the holidays because it's so hard to accept gifts and people to sacrifice money for you. Like in my small town there was a gift shop on all State patriotism wear and souvenirs, and I found a funny book of poems about cats, and laughed a lot, showing a ton of the poems to my mom, because plenty seem like it was about OUR CAT,  and it was so relatable. When my mom offered to buy it for me, I immediately thought "do I really need this sticking around my room? I'm causing a burden for my mom" and I look at the price tag of $13 and said NOPE. My mom tried to convince me but I couldn't let her buy it for me. This is often with deserts at restaurants and when for example my mom's friend has a lot bigger spending habit and wanted to buy me a fortune for a whole dollar from the fortune machine.... like I can't even repay them because I'm still too young for a job. This was since I was really little when my mom wanted to get me ice cream when I felt really sad, and denied anything that my parents offered to "bribe and help me feel better"... I just need to be alone and I'll be all cleaned up and fine next day.
Not me, i get every year on the Christmas shiet load of fireworks
Wow - that was depressing.
2:16 this girl is literly me when they give me clothes😂
Canadian???
Christmas = socks for days
Can't argue with science.
So people depression comes from caring about the oceans and worrying about heart disease? lol
Why limes are sour
Generally speaking, ive never had a sucky christmas, neither has my familtly. Its not about the gifts, the meal, or the decorations, its about you being greatful for the loved ones and the awesome word around you.
asapscience life is hell
Could you please do why third wave feminism is bad for western society
My clock hit 00:33 when the 33% came up
wait! what! they're Canadian?
I got a question. What’s the science in getting drunk, more importantly why do ppl feel the need to let out there feelings when they’re drunk??
I love sun.
How many people die on black friday yearly? (on average)
its not more then Indian doing on their festivals.  Indian festivals are worst for nature.
well.. just dont get sucked into this monstrous marry-go-round. Like i do - i dont celebrate xmas at all and iam happy.
15% of yall are ungrateful and arent getting anything but coal this year
I love the holidays, I love winter. It never sucks for me. I Hope everyone can avoid these problems and enjoy these times as much as I do.
I don't give gifts and don't receive any and help cooking and that makes the holidays so much more fun tbh
Just relax, smoke a joint, and go looks at some Christmas lights. Alcohol kills you. Weed will help you stay alive. Plus it makes eating all the good holiday food way better.
I think that the problem is that people focus on the wrong things. Christmas is not about food or presents, is about love. People often forget that it is all about love! There is nothing wrong with you wanting to have fun and giving to your loved ones a beautiful present. But it's not just this, it's more.
Christmas* It's CHRISTMAS, not 'holidays' ffs..
And here I thought it was just my father beating me over the head with a broken beer bottle
Yo did that actually say scamazon?
Anyone else here see the Canadian money... no just me
I thought it was a melting lipstick channel...
Is that a Canadian $20 bill coming out of the wallet? Wow! Surprised!
this is partly why i don't celebrate Christmas
i agree
I’m sick for Christmas so yea
I am 15%♡
just overdose on alcohol
Top 10
The holidays aren't good for everyone some people can't even afford to have good holidays it's just sad how this happens all the time and people just forget about it this is just so sad
Thanks for ruining the holidays for everyone
youre literally just stating random facts
sorry but i must say that you dont have a great narrating voice, at least in my eyes it would be better to keep mitch on the narrating job.
I've never noticed the amount of waste at Christmas as much as I have this year. It's quite sinister and frankly sickening. We just can't raise awareness of this issue fast enough but your fun and interesting videos are such a great approach to spreading messages to drive change. You guys are amazing! Merry Christmas, Meg
I think this video will get a subsequent amount of dislikes(-_-)
What happens to your body when your in love
Well i just lost all of my friends few years back from now. And right from then onwards I'm celebrating literally every special occasions alone in my room also my birthdays. Really sucks being lonely especially during new years and birthdays. And it sucks even more when your brother/sisters celebrate new years in their room next to your room with their friends & have fun.
I freakin despise the holidays when it comes to gifts. It's like forcing people to be nice and spend money on each other when in the end they both spent money and could have just gotten what they wanted for themselves or just gotten another person a gift randomly to have more meaning and thought behind it. 


I was amazed when my parents at age 62 decided not to do gifts this year and it was such a relief but I still have to get gifts for my wife's side of the family so it never ends...
I think I've got SAD...
I understand that the holidays have evolved, but for many people Christmas is a wonderful holiday with lots of religious value. If more focus was on the original meaning maybe they would not "suck" to you.
But if there weren't any holidays during the shortest day of the year, Idk... that would probably be depressing too. Life is what you make of it, and you can always CHOOSE to participate in the holiday season or not... I personally just think its all about the lack of sun and warmth. I mean its hard to stay happy when you wake up in darkness when you go to work and go home in darkness at the end of the work day.
You lie in almost all your videos, rhis aint educational
Do you guys remember when ASAP was on big brother? Like if you do
They should make from thanksgiving to Christmas a time for rest.
I love Christmas
Did anyone else notice the Canadian bill? O CANADAAAAAAaaaaaaaa
I spent 300 bucks on Christmas gifts. People going way overboard 30 bucks a person is plenty lol.
I'm toooo early
The only thing that sucks for me is that my sleep gets f*cked.It's 5 am:(
What's better for you - non fiction or fiction?
Thank God I am  a Muslim hmd <3
Danish is no more 😭
i have never died after christmas, i dont know what are you talking about
The topic of the deadweight loss of christmas and gifts was in Decembers SAT english reading section
i have not worried about xmas gifts in 2 years and i can say its probably the best thing i have ever done, i usually save the money that i would of spent on gifts and use it to pay debt.
We've spent $2,000 on our family of 10
Nah, they suck because both of my parents are dead, I'm not close with any other family members, and don't get invited to holiday dinners.
Another reason Ariana Grandes concert is Sold Out 😟
God damn this channel turned to stoner science lol
australia is always summer
That deadweight Chritsmas thing with loss of value of gifts is why I always just ask for just money. That way I can pick my own things instead of whatever they think i'll enjoy.
It’s not that deep
Here's a tip to everyone in the comment section. Pour family has always done wish lists. Tell your family what you want. It makes it so much easier to shop and way less stressful. AND you're always happy!!
31 Декабря -- Русские, Мы накладываем столы . Празднуем по-Лучшему !
В НОЧЬ 31-го . А ложимся примерно в 4 часа ночи .
People expect too much of the season all I want is family, food and.....my yearly gift of socks and underware. Everything else is just a bonus.
For me, it’s because I work retail — more customers, more stress, more rudeness and abuse from said customers
Scamazon?
I didn't know the holidays sucked, other than cold weather.
Why does the doctor look like he is laughing at the guy’s heart attack?
Thanks for the video! I acctually live in Brazil and here the weather is a huge problem. The temperature is extremely high, we spend a lot of money on eletric bills, there is no confort at all in this heat, only with you have a pool ou are in some beach or lake. Even the beer gets too hot! Were we have a tradition to pick up a name of a friend ou familiar and then have to buy him a present without knowing who picked you. Is extremely frustating because you get something you dont like from someone you hate. I apreciate knowing others dont like these hollidays too much!
Cold weather made me sick
What is the name of the program you are using?
I don't use wrapping paper. It hides a present for 5 seconds until the recipient opens it. wasted money on paper and it only goes in the bin.
You guys are such a joyful channel
jeez, I could of told y'all that the holidays suck long before I saw this video. especially when you have family that visit everyone in the family except for you, and then give you a lame excuse as to why they couldn't as much send a damn card.
So ur saying that, Jesus's -Birthday Sucks 🙁🙁🙁😢😢😢
My birthday is December 31
I have a cold at the moment. My throat is torn and hurts to breathe.
I must be the only bastard that hates Christmas with an absolute passion. 
Not due to religious views. But the fact that that it seems that we have to buy evey bloke and his dog some gift. Bugger that I would rather be fishing im contempt with all I have
Grinch...
You just ruined Christmas for me
Come in guys, youve got to talk about rewind
Where are you Christmas? Why can’t I find you? Why have you gone away...?
People gain weight during the holidays. Nah boi I lost weight between thanksgiving and New Years and it isn't even the new year yet.
why cant we precicly remember when we fell asleep or when we woke up?
i haven't celebrated any holidays for the past 18 years and i couldn't be happier (actually i'm severely depressed but that's not related to the lack of holiday celebration)
Meanwhile in India...
Im never been more happy living in a tropical region
Watched this before christmas eve
Way to spread cheer
Lucky that I am a Jew
quietly sips eggnog
I honestly don’t care what i get for christmas.
Haha, people should stop giving gifts to loved ones. You should just love your family and friends and be there for them. I stopped doing gifts a long time ago because it is shallow. Friendship shouldn't have a price tag.
I hate it because you're force to spend time with people you don't even like A.K.A. family.
Holidays suck because they end.
And then when you work in retail people are terrible to you :)
Hey! this is the holidays no science please
Or if you’re like me and just had acl surgery today and have to sit on the couch for 2 weeks that can make it pretty shitty too😂
Why is there a different voice? I don't like it. It doesn't feel like asap science.
Jesus doesn’t like his birthday very much
Who else eating a lot of junk food so you can diet on the new year?😂😂
It’s summer here in Australia so it is boiling but normal.

Well, now I know what to show people when they ask me why I hate Christmas

2:26 I have the exact same wallet 😱
Why does everything get loud when you are falling asleep? I notice this during movies when I get tired the dialogue seems so loud
I actually don't celebrate Christmas nor Halloween cuz I'm Muslim so I'm always wondering how it is celebrateing
Early
Oh well its not like EVERYONE gets a gift or something good. Yet, MY FAMILY get screwed. Some how we lose people and pets around now. It ruins Christmas for us.
I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO SCHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLL
3 pounds you say I’d lose that in a minimum of three days just by sitting. I have a high metabolism lol
At 2:15 is he trying not to laugh or is that just me?
Am I the only one who lost weight during the christmas?😂
i never liked Christmas anyway
That voice, though...
while Christmas can be depressing for me sometimes because of unrealistic expectations, I've never quite understood seasonal depression. For me, the best times of my life are in Fall and Winter, and I get more depressed in Spring and Summer.

Happy christless everyone
Now i have science to support me
Scamazon
Ya ASAP, the holidays this year for u sucks
Nah the trash don't bother me, it's the dysfunctional family drama that make the holidays a suck fest
We have the same phone!
Let's please call it Xmas - because the Christ seems nowhere to be found. All I want for Christmas is that it is over as soon as possible.
Christmas can suck my jingle bells.
First
Past few years, I was trying to force the Christmas  spirit.,, but its just not there anymore, and it doesnt help that ai keep coming up  on aritckes and videos about how  Christmas is a pagan holiday.. Sigh
Honestly being alone has to be the worst, why would you leave that out of the video?
Lol I don't even celebrate Christmas
I personally don’t like the act of asking for things for Christmas. It ruins the surprise on Christmas Day and it’s nice to buy a thoughtful gift for someone that you know they’ll like but haven’t necessarily asked for it.
We need to do something about it people.. eat vegetables, save some money and maybe work in the holiday season.
449th commenter
Bah humbug? 😐
agree
0:40 per month?
I like this but if it takes you months to loose 1/2 a pound or even 3 u got a prob hell my mom has lost weight like 2 times i think or 3 and lost 5 pounds a week which im going to do that to cause well i got fat recently XD hence the video
The grinch sponsored this vid
If you live in the UK you get rain every 5 minutes
Honestly in my city no one has the spirit of chrismas.Its really sad cause my family forgot it was christmas,abd i only saw 1 in like 30 houses that actually decorated the house.Its honestly kind of sad.
Ugh, I have my own reasons to hate the holidays.
me2irl
Ok but its a time where peaple who have a winter depression get a bit more happy, The joy of kids, its just worth it. Everything has an end, so does the world. So just don’t worry! Enjoy your life while you still Can.




Yeah i HATE the winter cuz its just cold and in My country there is NO snow
I hate Halloween all the way through Presidents day. Dont force me to pretend to be happy. Your happiness makes me even more sad lol
Fight me
I always feel so much worse around the holidays or vacations, because everyone else seems happy and I expect to be happy but when I'm not it's just a huge disappointment.
I got a question.. somtimes even when i do have morning wood in the morning i can still in my dream make it so some things dont hurt like they would irl like in a dream i was a week monster in undertale so mu hp was drained by a needle from the head and i was thinking “ oh this is gonna hurt i bet plz dont hurt” and it didn’t hurt but when it did happen i woke up after words a minute later in the dream would after my hp was drained. So how does that work then? ( i got this from the morning wood video of yours)
I never liked holidays from October to December. The only holiday I like is New Years because the fireworks
It can take months??? to lose just only 1/2lbs - 3lbs??? Lol only Americans
i just got sick on the 23rd and I wanna shoot myself because i got sick on christmas 😢😡
who's watching this sick rn? ;_;
It’s the worst if u pass out crossing the road and get run over (still alive tho)
Huh?
This isn't science
People spending money on presents is a good thing stimulates the economy also you said it probably adds more trash to ocean it may not because most first World countries put their trash in landfills and they are the ones buying all that wrapping papper
1:50 I have sad.
SCAMAZON
SCAMAZON
What a nice video!!!
Family for my family is cursed and I’m not joking 5 people have died in December in my family and I’m not even in my twenty’s yet.
What’s ur favourite science ?
haha, I'm too poor to afford real gifts and stuff, I put out the same plastic tree every year, and buy gifts with a total of 100 CAD (give or take).
I always knew it. They suck anyways.
Grinch
it’s yanny
It’s Because of your annoying relatives.
Yeah when i get gifts for my family, they're honest about why they don't like them 🎁
Many years ago, I made a friend who invited me over for Christmas. That was nice, as I'd just moved away from home and it was good to have a place to spend the evening with someone I liked. Until.... I got a gift that I thought appropriate to A - my spending ability and B - someone I'd known less than a year. As she had financial problems, which she was always vocal about, I was expecting something similar. Imagine my surprise when I had a pile of stuff dumped in my lap totaling to about $100 in value! And this was 1993, when $100 was a chunk of change, especially for someone struggling to make ends meet! Why do people do this? I certainly couldn't have afforded to spend as much as she did, nor am I the kind to put myself into a bad situation to do so. But she sure did. Wow. Yeah. It was an awkward evening after that. :(
Yeah, it's kind of feeling sad because of trying so hard to be happy.
Can you suggest the animation software you used
I love the holidays. All of them. Usually the ONLY thing that ruins a holiday for me is shitty whiny people. But my resolution for NYE is to cut negative depressing people out of my life. This year has been a rough one but it's all because of parasitic people that have been in my life. But not for much longer
lol for some reason i lose weight in the holidays
Nice try grinch, maybe next year
nah more like 5k a child.. or that’s the reality i live in(i’m the child)

You mean Christmas you leftists
eh idgaf merry christmas,and even though there are more bad things on earth we have the right mind to fix it,holidays are about the good things and i dont and never will hate it
Well, makes sense home waste would rise giving people are staying home and not going to work..
0:12 that is awful.  I always save the wrapping paper at least...
Well.. my holiday sucks because most of my family is drunk and really loudly singing Christmas carols. They aren’t letting me watch ANY Christmas movies on the tv, and I left my laptop at my other house and my main gift needs a laptop to work. It is so terrible
ok
I HATE HOLIDAYS
Melting lipstick
Well it’s summer here
The holidays suck cause I have a cold 🙃
Good thing I'm Muslim
The holidays don’t suck just think about all the good things instead of the pad like being with your family and exchanging gifts and singing holiday songs, and spending time with the people you love, it doesn’t always has to be bad, thats my opinion.
Why does plastic end up in the sea when that isn't how it should be disposed of?
Moral of the story: Cancel christmas
1:10 I eat a lot the entire here to overcome that problem
TRAGIC.
PREACH
Because they can't swallow huehuehue
Nobody is cooler than the people that make sure they let everyone know that they don't celebrate Christmas
So humans are being disgusting irrational pigs... nothing new here.
My cousins just give me free bags
I try to keep my schedule and lifestyle similar to usual around the holidays. I feel there is no need to eat and drink to an excess for an entire month.
Christmas movies make me happy
If you gift cash to your family, they can't be disappointed, and if they are then they're wrong.
Plzzz
christmas suqqs
Okayyy so the followers of this channel are all nerds...hmmm
where is mitch?
Wow
Add in YouTube rewind and it sucks even more
I HATE Christmas for personal reasons.
The american culture. Those are very alarming estadistics
What does pollution have to do with bad holidays? Based off of your title, I thought you were gone a talk about like... Idk something besides pollution
God gave you a creative brain, You are a usefull person, That understand alote of science, And unfortunatelly you disbelieve in the creator that gave you all this, becarefull before you die brother, dont die as a disbeliever
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Hello
So basically: spend your Christmas in countries like Australia where it’s summer time, so you have much sun and warmth which makes generally happy (most people) and because of the heat you tend to eat less and you sweat more so you drink more water and burn more calories = probably also loose some weight or at least don’t gain as much as spending Christmas in a cold region. 👍🏼
Ugh ,another guy hating Christmas
Go on one direction
The trash that us in the "western" world produce is not actually the problem it is the third world rivers that get it to the ocean and our efforts should go into catching it right there before it breaks up. Once we have stopped the incoming plastic then we can go for the rest but there's no point putting our efforts into cleaning the garbage patches if it still keeps coming.
Why in the ocean??? Its best to recycle them again its makes the world cleaner rather than throwing the trash on the ocean wich makes it worst..and fish eats the trash wich we eat those fish and once we ate them..we get sick..and repeat
I wish I was jewish
Eeh, nah
Issue with rubbish is the fact that you can't recycle wrapping paper here in the UK! No wonder we throw out so much, imagine if it could all be reused and recycled - but councils just won't take it because of glitter/tape etc.
They did surgery on a grape tho
Well its not suck, because you will die on the birth of Jesus. Is that amazing?!
I don't understand how people can be unhappy with free gifts I'd be happy no matter what I got it
It’s cuz all the other months have 30 or 31 days and January has 300 days
The holidays are great and you guys are dickheads.
Am I the only one who does not have cold or snow in the country and they don’t celebrate Christmas:(
It sucks because I dont see her😟
I certainly agree... the holidays suck! I’m very sick of doing this same crap every year. My family finally changed the rules of gifts... we pick a name and have a 30$ limit... years before we had to get gifts for every member of the family, making it hundreds of dollars.
Now can you scientifically explain  why YouTube rewind sucks??
Wow I can’t believe Christmas turned from celebrating Jesus’s birth to this
It's true, holidays suck. You have to meet people that you don't really care about and weigh every word as to not start a really heated argument at the dinner table and ruin a day that's supposed to be happy.
I dont like christmas anyways^^
my sister was born in January
Christmas does NOT suck... It depends on each person's productive ways
Lol
If you think christmas sucks then you're doing it wrong ;)
I spent Christmas deathly hung over. So that sucked.
Can you please do a video of why Islam is harmful ?
At least I don't celebrate Christmas. Just kidding it is worse.
“Are Millennials ruining Christmas?”
What actually sucks is that people watching this video won't change any of their habits even though they learned that they are wrong from this video.
not to mention the fact that jesus was born, is that why the holidays are terrible?
It doesn't take months to lose weight, just limit your're food intake to 500 Calories per day and drink only water you can lose 3-5 pounds at the end of the week.
i Don't think it sucks
Could you guys do a video explaining why there's only two Sexes to get all these stupid social justice Warriors the reason why there are only two sexes
I hate Christmas simple as that.
Woot woot woo woo it’s me
We spent less than $200 on gifts for like 8 or 9 people. If they don't like it... I'll take it back and they can have nothing.
Why would you ruin Christmas?
If i gained £3 every time i put on weight, I would  be rich!
You know what, your channel sucks
AsapGoogle
That's why you have a family of only 3 to 4 people and you give them MONEY for a gift.
I mean I just get a chocolate bar (fun size) and a slap on the back
If you didnt suck the holidays wouldn't either
Lol it doesn't suck as much when you swim and tan each day... Also ice-cream tends to help too.
I kinda hate the holydays and I hate eating too much so I never eat that much for Christmas, maybe even less than a normal lunch because of the stress I get by staying with lots of people that don't stop talking and often ask you: "Why are you eating so little?". Eventually after a lot of these asks I don't even eat the dessert.
I’m always happy what I get for Christmas there are kids who don’t have what you have be grateful for what you have
But the ugly Christmas sweater is awesome! Vitamin D, some sun can prevent cancer and sun is good all around.
I hate thanksgiving I love Christmas I don’t really care about new year I don’t eat more during the holidays and I don’t buy presents so I’m not stressed at all :D
That’s why practical gifts are the best. A nice pack of socks is appropriate from just about anyone and I’ll definitely use them. Gas gift cards and visa gift cards too. If you have a close friend that you can joke with give them a big pack of toilet paper and write them a nice handwritten note telling them you know they’re full of s**t. We as a society cannot worry about being generic. If you legitimately have someone in your life and you know what they’d like then of course get them something they’ll cherish. Otherwise be general, the receiver will likely get more utilization out of it and you won’t end up with a bunch of junk.
I hate the holidays bc I don't like getting gifts, my family, or food so yeet
That’s why you ask want people want instead of surprising people with a sweater.
i was thinking it sucks because some of us need to go visit homophobic family members
isn't life pointless we all will die
Christmas is the worst.
Canadian dollar
wow who doesn’t like the gift they receive assholessss
Im still eating left over Halloween candy
HEY YOU ARE THE GUYS WHO WERE ON YOUTE REWIND !!!
Case im dont have enough weed is  the only reason holiday sucks
Wait wait wait, people spend THAT MUCH ON GIFTS?!! Holy shite! I'm glad I don't live in America! o.o
Yeah I guess India and China should stop dumping their garbage into the ocean. That's where most of it comes from. Not going to let people in those countries put a damper on my holidays. Also 85% of people being happy with the gift they receive seems like a pretty good percentage to me.
Because "mandatory" social contact with your despicables, alcoholics, or stupidly religious relatives.
It sucks when you're too old to receive the presents but still young enough to clean up the house.
People think materialism matters most during holidays, that’s why it sucks. Temporary objects do not bring eternal happiness.
You know what, we are all gonna die one day so may as well enjoy it. I’m British we eat and drink until we are sick. Merry christmas
B
People always die around the holidays for me. Last year my grandma and grandpa died a few days after my birthday. I hate the holidays.
I like the facts but why do you have to do to us like that do you have a purpose for giving us these terrible facts
K
This is why atheists should be given euthanasia
Christmas in the worst time of the year, mainly because people won't shut up about it once Halloween ends. There's also tons of terrible Christmas songs and movies.
Bet they wouldn’t do one on Halloween. Especially considering the holiday is about candy and sugar. And all the little bits of candy wrapped plastic, packaged in more plastic.
No u
Holidays suck cos here in Singapore we get a 2 months school holiday(November-December) which ends WAY TOO QUICKLY Thus that’s why holiday sucks
Christmas is just another way to boost sales. So the rich can get richer while we get poorer.
2:12 Scamazon? Really? Why do you think amazon is scam? And, as a science channel, how can you tell it to people? You can have your opinion but you shouldn't push it using science videos.
We handmade ornaments and I used pretty hat boxes that we can reuse for a few gifts. I hate how over commercialized the holidays are it’s so stupid.
This isn't why holidays suck because if you go by the way they are actually supposed to be celebrated they are great but this is why human habits suck
I hate Christmas  ... I was in TV 2 years ago... it was  in this time... Christmas time... people there helped us but... I learned something about one person... I liked him but now I hate him... he is the main character in TV show I was in... and he presents himself like he is God ...like he is the greatest human being but he is the worst.... he is good only when cameras are around... and when are Christmas... I think about him more often..... another reason why I hate Christmas is because it is just  time when people are stressed and they try to find a good gifts for their family and people are just crazy... they think they have to buy gifts because it is Christmas .... they think that they have to eat because of Christmas dinner etc... that is good for marketing and shit like that and they use it for themselfs..... everything cost more money ( idk how it is in other countrys but in mine it is like this) ... Christmas isn't what it was some time ago.. it was about family and friends now it is about money... then... I feel lonely... I usualy walk around the city with my headphones and cry... noone cares... even if they see me... (if someone is outside of course, because most of the people are at night home where is warm and they are on their mobiles/ PC, they watch TV etc) I am alone outside where is cold, dark and I am crying because I would rather be alone in the dark and cold outside than home... and it hurts.... then... meybe for someone Christmas WOULD  be family holidays but... they don't have family... and now they feel it more than in any other days in the year... like me... or if people aren't in contact all year and they meet only at Christmas, they say hi, eat dinner than say bye, see you next year at Christmas... what is the point of this? They don't know each other all year, they don't help each other all year but they eat dinner together one time in the year because they are "family"... it is all fake...  I really  hate Christmas...
Unsubscribed
You two are really straying away from what made you guys popular. First you tried to make science out of racism, now you are trying to ruin Christmas! You’re becoming another copy pasted leftist news source. Could you guys have had the decency to upload this video after New Years?
Its sad our society is so brain washed and conditioned into these ways. Christmas is a money grab, Its another made up religious holiday that really doesnt mean shit but we were brought up to believe it does.
Actually, if lack of sunlight is bad, come travel to the tropical countries. Sunlight everyday! Unless it’s raining of course. :v But anyways, come near the equator. You can go to the beach or swim in the water. It’s gonna be a warm Christmas! Like my country. Totally not sponsoring travel companies, airlines and hotels.
Yep!... They really suck. I just want all to be over already.
I know... I'm a Grinch!
Thank you so much for this video! This is so true! Every time, I mention to people that I am not a fan of Xmass holidays because they suck - they look at me weird - and I am like dude you do not know my family or how obsessive they get - I would so much rather just go on an alone holiday in snowy mountains somewhere then deal with that shit - if only I could afford that and not have to deal with the fallout with the family on to of that...

Science spin “In My Blood” by Shawn Mendes
This so cool wish they did this for every subject I learn songs easier then written facts this would help me so much
Ariana-Keep on brethin
Victoria Justice- I think we can ALL keep on breathin
I'm actually crying xD
I'm way too much of a Biology nerd.
A weeks worth lesson understand in a short video.
When i didn't understand this, my teacher said there is no other way she could teach me. I watched this video and understood instantly!!!! Who needs school when you have this???😂😂😂
This video? - iconic
Their voices? -amazing
Ariana Grande ? - shook



Hotel? -Trivago
Better than the actual song im not kidding
ExPlaIn
If only biology lessons were like this at school... then maybe I wouldn’t wanna fall asleep so much.
You are gonna die if you stop breathin’ 

Life advice from asapscience
I never thought I'd be 'shook' from an ASAP Science video. I was wrong.
What a Good way to motivate  students to learn
This song made me memorize everything I needed for my test nd I passed it with a full Mark thank you so much for this amazing video😁
Oh, you gonna die if u stop breathing. Lmao lol
At 0:39 that was a great voice thing
Just keep watching and watching and watching
"Into the alveoli" 🎵 Im living. Yassss
Omg you guys are genius I love it 




Anyone watching in 2019?....... Anyone? Or is it only me?!?
I played this song is my science lesson and the students and the teacher loved it. Thanks xx
The moment you realise that it's just two guys....
This is the only way I could ever learn science.
Click this button if you were breathing during the video 
👇🏻
It's so helpful for my test lol thanks Asap Science !!! ❤️❤️❤️
My science teacher showed me this and now I'm in love with your channel😭😭😭😂😂
Still better than YouTube rewind 2018
I'm going into Respiratory Therapy... this song will be an anthem!

Thank you~!
I always binge watch your vids
When I should be doing homework 
My excuse is that it’s educational
I’m addicted. Love your channel ❤️
This is actually so good😀👍❤
This is better than my biology class !! I learnt much more than I learnt from bio class
My breath smells bad, keep breathing?
Attended biology class for week understand 1% watching this video understood 100%
Better than ariana grande?





I think they are equally amazing..
LET'S GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THIS MASTERPIECE 👏👏👏
mom: Ask if you finished studying respiratory cycle.
me: shows this video
0:36 there is a typo for the word multiple it should be multiply
If education was legit easy like this👌👌 
I would never get bored 😂😂
So this is a 2 minute ad for oxygen?
How to remember physic formula (next song)
I am showing this to my science teacher as soon as possible. She will never have to worry about teaching this again Lol!!!!
Did anyone else focus on there breathing, while watching that video
0:37
Into the alveoli
Damn that's some sweet voice
 Can't stop listening to that part. I love it!
Keep bleeding and you should connected with the blood coagulation .... awesome work 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I can’t listen to breathin the same anymore after this
I dare you to say that to a guy 
Having asphixiation (did u spell that right?)
Wtf is wrong with you. I love you guys so much😂😂❤❤
how do i keep breathin' after this?

watch it again :)
Just keep breathing reminds me of Dori in finding nemo ( juat keep swimming just keep swimming)😂😂😂
I literally passed my exam using this as backup. Love the song!
who else is watching wile holding there breath?
May I suggest a song about the cardiac cycle? ❤
😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 at first I tought that are many men!!!😂😂😂
pentatonix who??? 
ariana who??

i only know asapSCIENCE
Your voices are really good wtf
Wow literally took my breath away. ♥️
You are so creative and intelligent
You make things so easy for us to understand ✌️❤️❤️
This video was really helpful, because I have this theme in biology right now, thank you.
Any asthma people out there?
Tomorrow I have an exam about this haha
Omg this'll make biology easy 😭😭
Please do the countries song!!!!!!!!
If you agree like
Well.. future potential video presentation in Science class.. wait till our teacher shows this to us.
My teacher used this video to teach about breathing 😂
OH MY GOD WTF THIS IS ON ITUNES I'M GONNA GET IT I'LL BE BACK GUYS!!!
Edit: just got it only 1.00 it's cheap you're not that broke. GO GET IT!!!
i was studying for biology then found this video.
Saw this video , immediately clicked
Can you please do “In My Blood” by Shawn Mendes
Can you make a song about classification? (Just a suggestion❤🍟🐕)
This is 100000000x better than YouTube rewind 2018
Love it they need to show this in science class 😂😂
Thanks I will use this for my science class
Lets take a moment to appreciate the "bum bummers" in the background 👏👏👏
Well , I have asthma , so ...
Carbon dioxide disliked the video
someone hire these guys as my science teacher at school lmao
This is actually pretty lit!
Why didn't I see this earlier...It's posted right before my Science mid-year exam?! And I was exactly tested on this...
This was so helpful guys 😁Amazing video 🙌🙌💞
Ariana! It’s okay...your job is safe...just keep breathin’ and breathin’ and breathin’ and breathin’!!❤️
I actually like more listening this than the original.
the new way of learning <3 love this song
Still waiting for an asapscience version of thank u, next
Ariana is FOUND SHAKING, QUAKING, CHOKING, WHEEZING AND DYING
Took me 10 mins to realize that was 2 guys
This is WAY better than the original one
Can you do a parody song by Alan Walker's new album, Different World?
Love this! And helps A Level biology revision
SO AWESOME
how you guys are not only smart but talented in music and singing!! And how it rhymes, and how it amazes me about how our bodies work... God's design is ingenius
Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi look different in this one

Damn this got many likes.. Listen to my music on my channel!!!
Please do a version of "Sweet but Psycho" by Ava Max and sing "OC's sweet but a psycho" 😂
Dissapointed, no mention of my boi the diaphragm.
I just love the rawness of your videos. It's very captivating.
I love it 😂❤️ It's the perfect combination of education and comedy 😂
Pulmonologists/Respirologists everywhere will be jamming to this very fresh breath of musical air! "Epiglottis flap stops a tube mishap" is the best scientific rhyme scheme I've heard lately!

NOTE: As some others may have pointed out long before now, there is a minor (multiple = multiply) typo in the subtitles.
Wow I actually enjoyed this!👍🏻
You guys remind me a bit of two pentatonix singers 
Who are also lgbt 
🌈
i love they do it as an a Capella! (without instruments)
Man this was real good!
You guys should SERIOUSLY do Blood, Sweat and Tears.  Perfect for science AND it's BTS. 😻💜
Do you ever just make a song about breathing to flex on asthma ni🅱️🅱️as
Please make on of your songs based on photosynthesis 😁
THIS IS MY SONG!!!!!😍😘😝
Do more songs like this please I sang this in my biology practice exam and it saved my life
Make a Video on the Morphology of Flowering Plants based on Troye Sivan's BLOOM
I want to see you make a parody of High Hopes from Panic at the Disco
They can make science more interesting than anybody else in this world can.
welp, learned more here than my science class
Airways flow through me
Making up all my energy izogen used to make atp intake through cavetys nas path lubricate through the the pharinx to navigate epiqlottis flap stops a tube mishap whether your food air regulated ohh trachea broncji broncios multiply finanly ends up right in to the alveoli just keep breathing and breath and breathe and breathan this is how your bod it keeps on breathe just kepp breathe and breathe and breathe and brethren your gonna doe if you stop breathe oh yeah o2 fills the blood moving round with the the pajsjsju this took so long I have to play this cod.slowly and write every word help me

Mangos dont breathe...





Am i dead?
I can only image how much work this was! Nice job dudes!
Now this is gonna be stuck in my head all day
Who else started manually breathing?
I sent this to my biology teacher & she blocked me LOL
Good music
Good energy
Good lyrics
Good voices
Good vocals
Bery creative
This for me is the best way for learning
I love music and science😍😍
Mum: stop using ur phone listening and study ur biology quiz !!
Me:
Mum: oh
I knew this was going to be good.
We watched this in science today
Better than the original 😍😂
{LYRICS}



Airways, flow through me.
Making up all my enrgy.
Oxygen used to make ATP
Intake, through cavities
Nasal path’s gonna lubricate
Through the pharnyx then navigate.
Epiglottis flap, stops a tube mishap
Whether you’re food or air regulated

Ohh

Trachea bronchi
Bronchioles multiple finally ends up right
Into the alveoli

Just keep breahtin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
This is how your bod
Keeps on breathin’

Just keep breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
You are gonna die
If you stop breathin’
Oh yeah

O2 fills the blood
Moving ‘round with each palpitation
Aiding cells in their respiration
Take CO2 away
It is poisonous toxic waste
Breathe it out to self medicate

Feel that blood pumping
Now the brain’s running
Wanna keep all the those cells activated

Ooh

Back in alveoli
CO2 says “bye”
Don’t wanna keep it in
So you do it one more time

Just keep breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’
This is how your bod
Keeps on breathin’

Just keep breathin’
And breathin’
And breathin’ 
And breathin’
You are gonna die 
If you stop breathin’
Oh yeah

Epiglottis flap, stops a tube mishap
This how your bod
Keeps on breathin’
 
Feel that blood pumping
Now the brain’s running
You are gonna die 
If you stop breathin’
Oh yeah!
I watched this whilst I had a cold ;-;
I have a question:
Why does being paid feel so rewarding?
You ppl are amazing! Love u both❤️❤️😊
how to get ready for a science test 😂
when your old science teacher tries to be cool again
PLEASE MAKE MORE YALL HELPING ME  WITH MY CLASS SKDBSKDBSJSB anybody else taking in information easier through a song ???
Comment your top three favorite songs by asap science
Mine are:
Science wars
The periodic table
100 digits of pi
Thx so much Greg and Mitch for lighting up all my sad days I appreciate your hard work and effort
You guys are truly amazing ❤😘👍
You guys are brilliant 👌👌❤❤
,,You are gonna die if you stop breathin'..."
No shit, Sherlock! 😂
But pretty good video... :3
0:52

This is exactly what I call a nightmare and a dream simultaneously.
just FWI for all you non-science people CO 2 is carbon dioxide.
If a pop artist uploaded this, everyone would say how deep it was that "you are going to die if you stop breathin," thinking, "the hidden meaning is that we should keep going and never give up," while AsapSCIENCE is literally saying you're going to die if you don't physically breathe.
I was caught singing this in Biology class. Turns out my teacher knows this song!!
I want my science teacher to actually present this video in a projector for our lesson.
Dammit MY SCIENCE TOPIC CHANGED!
Please do an acapella with solar system😍
keep watching this so good 😂
I could’ve watched this before my science exam 😒
Thank u, next.
This shi't is damn good
I was breathing for the whole video. BUM!
SO MUCH FREAKING BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, I LOVE YOU THE MOST ASAP SCIENCE ❤️

Black font with a white outline will always be visible despite the background.
I'm training to become an EMT-b (hopefully I'll pass the national registry exam in may) and I loved this 😁😂
omg this is amazing, we were just learning about this in my bio class AND I LUV THIS SONG SO THANK YOU, IVE BEEN TOO LAZY TO STUDY THIS AND WERE GONNA HAVE A TEST ON IT <3
I was like: I swear this would be great for a ASAPScience parody when it got posted
omg 
when u make parodies based on a huge artist for the world to see it
I've played this like 5 times already. It's so AWESOME
0:58 uh.. wut.. depressing 14-yr-old over here 😅

1:00 ahh I see 😂
Kids/Educational Version of Breathin' by Ariana Grande
two mistakes in the vid...
0:36 multiple→multiply
1:34 CO2 doesnt get thrown out as shown, it goes out in the same path as inhaling exept its the opposite way

but i still love it! asapscience forever!
Now that shit’s amazing! Love you both so much! You’re such great role models! 🥰👨‍🔬👨‍🔬
Will you please make a song on heart and circulatory system with a soft song????please I'm a big fan of yours!!!!
That amazing😍😍 i really want to re-study that now😂💔
Better than bts videos/music lol

Sand come to me
Idk why but you 2 remind me of Mitch and Scott from Pentatonix
I’m always so amazed by Mitch’s voice every time I hear it! 🖤
lol thanks for this I have a test and questions on the respiratory system are gonna show up so cheers x
Omg this is so good hdhshssh. The singers and the lyrics are on point!!! Can you do dna of kendrick or bts next? 😂
This is soooo clever! I love this you guys are great❤️
You should totally do a parody of The Sounds Of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel and make it The Sounds Of Science! I would love to hear that! Like if you agree
Wait, is this their actual singing?
Thx I can finally pass my bio exam
I literally watched this right after I took a bio test about the respiratory system on accident
This video was about to make me stop breathin
we love that we said  you can't mix science with music lol
Okay, but why is this so proper???
They should really make other covers because they sound amazingggg
Song:“Your gonna die if you stop breathing”
Me: stops breathing
Great job😂❤️❤️❤️❤️ keep making learning funny process 🌹🌹
Nice but...
Bronchioles multiply not 'multiple'
0:36
You should totally do Last Christmas by Wham! maybe with some climate change puns!
Why couldn't this have come out before my Bio final 😭😭😭
I've learned more in this 3 minute video than I ever did at 7 hours of school.
This is actually helpful...woot
Sponsored by O’ Hare Air
Why is this lowkey better than the original?...
I'm learning this right now and this is helpful 😂🙈
OMG this is amazing!!! Especially for students taking anatomy, this is really a cute way to learn! LOL <3
Oxygen has joined the chat
My health teacher put that in class.
Marvelous marvelous job!!!! Could you please do a Scientific version of "God is a woman" ?
im praying I see this in my since class. Lmao
This is very awesome 😂🤣
This would have been the perfect opportunity to collab with Superfruit! Still great with you two though!
You should make one video of Little Mix's song DNA
this would have been so useful for my bio test
When you think thease are the real lyrics until 20 secs in....
OKKKKKK. Im lost of words. You guys can sing holy!!!!!!
Our science teacher showed us this video today
Breathing now switched to manual







Im sorry
That was actually pretty good...💁‍♀️
I LOOOVEDD THIS! please make more songs like these with popular songs it's so much easier to study for exams with this. 😍😍😍
I love a good science-related song remake. Well done!
Omg I love this!!! 😍
Thank you next 💫💕
My brain after watching this :your breathing auto pilot has shut of you need to be aware of your breathing.
Me:WHY!?
brain :I don't know hold on I'm working on it
Can you guys do sicko mode?
This is weirdly smart 😂
How to remember things for a test 😊
This is SO helpful literally just learnt gas exchange and respiratory system in a-level biology !!
This is frickin' genius😂
do in my blood next.
lol.
W H Y  is this lowkey good?
Awesome job, guys! Love this!
i never though5 they would make a scary vid
Nice video men! I have similar content in Romanian language on Instagram : @bujorrazvan
Philosophy ⚡️🧠⚡️Psychology🧐Relationship & Dating👫
👇www.bujorrazvan.com
This sounds so good! Educational and musically genius!
I actually used this in my biology PowerPoint and I got an A lol the teacher loved the song a lot and she said she is gonna use it in future classes!!!!
Holy shit it sounds almost the same as the OG song without main vicals
Never expect this come real 🤣 but now it's 😍😍😍
This is actually fire tho...
I've never been so intrigued and yet disturbed by those paper lungs
Alcohol and CBD?? How do they react together?
Who's here before a biology exam? 
Just me?okay...
I love you guys 💕

i bet you all the people that disliked this have asthma!
They're like nerdy Mitch and Scott I love it
Finally someone appreciates oxygen :”)
It's so weird how this video came out on the legit day my class started out respiratory unit in science. 😂😂
How about mo mamba?
Thanks now I need to think about breathing
😂😂😂😂ears blessed
I think there is a typo at the start , meant to say multiply but says multiple instead 0:36
I’ll never be able to sing the original again! Hahah
They remind me of people from Pentatonix
Omg y'all 😂 love it! 💕
This actually made my day!❤️😍😍😍❣️
Your the BEST
Who else took a deep breath when they saw the thumbnail and the title😂😂
You guys are like "Mitch & Cam" from "Modern family" 😂👌👌

😮😮😮😮y’all remind me of Pentatonix— ASAP Science edition
I feel like a nerd watching this... I Love It!
Hahahaah thank you so much. I was confused  w this respiratory tract. Those alveoli make me crazy. Thank u so much. Make video on urinary and digestive systems, pls.😂😂😂😂
I love your song videos so much and they actually really helped me so please keep making more 😊
That would have been really helpful for my science test last year...
ooohhh 😂😂😍😘😘 I'll gonna Learnt it now.....luv it
i learned more in this video then what I actually learn in science class... 💀
And if I don't breath?







Become a unicorn








Oh wait I need a horn.I guy (prob im stupid)
CHANGE MY MIND!!!
This is so amazing!😁👌
I like this more than the original
Well since im so early 6 seconds Hi ASAP SCIENCE
THIS IS JUST DAMAGING THE PICTURE OF ARIANA!!!

DON'T YOU THINK!!!!
All fish are quaking
It is spectacularly creepy parodying the shit out of Ariana Grande using analog lungs, I kind of visualised them as actual lungs... so, yeah......
👏I👏have👏asthma👏
Ya’ll breathing manually now aren’t ya’
Song on electric volts ,ohms an stuff?
please do a video asthma !!!
my science grade just flew to the moon lmao
@AsapSCIENCE When you guys said "Bronchioles multiply" the lyrics read "Bronchioles multiple"
I love your songs there're amazing💁👌
I be hyptonize of this video!
Just if this came out a little earlier I wouldn't have failed my science test this bad (I'm moving down to a lower set now 😭)
Never stop loving these nerds ❤️
CO2 *TRIGGERED*
Hey! 


Could you do a science song on Charlie Puth? I am a Puthinator, you see.


Or selena gomez's back to you.


Or believer, and you could explain the brain.


Or on your email :D


THANK YOU
U guys never fail to impress me 😂😊
How to breathe:
Breathe.
This is literally why I pass biology
This was so good it's like you described the whole mecanism and still didn't get out of the rhythm or whatever they call it
OMG PLESE DO MORE OF THESE OMG
Gonna use this to help me study human biology. Thankful for y’all 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Honestly this is what i thought of when i heard the title of the original song
Nice editing!
this is my new favourite thing

This is amazing, super creative!
Wow perfect for science thanks!!
kenape jumpe lagu ni awal2 time form 4 ke ?
I had my AP Biology final on Wednesday; I wish I had this video to help me study 📖
bacon eggs
I should have discovered this video before my biology exams. Oh well now I'm probably going to fail😂
Slight cringe but good effort lol
This is actually good  😂🙌
Who else came here from the Instagram post? 😂😂
Nice way to learn 😂🙏
science classes  in the future are going to be hella fun
ASTHMA DECLARES WAR ON L U N G
Now you’ve officially become Scott and Mitch of superfruit😂
THIS IS SO GOOD I LOVE IT 😂😂😂💞
YASS YOU FINALLY POSTED
A really fascinating way to learn science..!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Best thing about it is that there is no musics and just beat boxing or vocals
I got my Science teacher to play this in class
"CO2 says bye"
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH <3
how an orgasm works with a song idk which one lmao
You know i know i already memorized this
And this is why I love asap science
wait this actually helped me
You guys need to do 'In My Blood' by Shawn Mendes!
#betterthantheoriginal
Is this a parody of a popular song, ive never heard the original
I just came to comment one thing:




 You're welcome.
This is better than the real song. 







 😐
Absolutely love this. It will keep me remember it !
I've been doing some research on longitudinal electrical waves and can't find a good video of someone explaining them. Please make a video of this, thanks.
The dislikes are from carbon dioxide
This video was made for hip teachers
what tf did i just watch 😅

well at least it’s better than youtube rewind 2018
That moment when you keep controlling your airways  ........
This is sooooooo good. Thanks Mitch and Greg
This needs more view it's a bop
who else is watching this while holding there breath? #REBELLIFE
I was so self conscious about my breathing while watching this.
Who else held their breath lol😂
how long have y'all been singing for?
Breath taking
Micro Organisms more like Micro Orgasm
Y'all know this is a bop
Oh, man, this video disabled my automatic breathing
I learned more from this than i ever learned in school
this saved my life
Live for this 💘💘
NoBody makes Science more interesting than youuuuu. Literally your voices are amazing
Do next: Bod Is A Woman
You are gonna die if you stop breathn'🤣🤣
Very good vídeo, i never thought on a musical science video
I will not stop untill somebody sees this at their school 

Day 1
I'm first, what should I do??


Btw this is great!!!

❤ u guys
That's fine but will it play on internet explorer?
Ariana’s wig said GIRL BYE!
Next we need a song about how your body keeps on dumping, you can sit on the toilet and demonstrate
Oh my god I love !!!!😍
This is good but cringe
Currently 535 CO2s Dislike this video.

Well done! My grandson might impress his teacher
You forgot my air!🤔
No oxygen was harmed in this video.....
"You are gonna die if you stop breathing!" -LoVe ThAt
This is amazing!  Thank you
This was so interesting to watch I got so distracted that I almost forgot to breathe
Ari is life🌙💧
My bio teacher writes songs for every unit. She’s love this.
the dislikes are all the co2 cells that your calling toxic and waste. poor co2 just wants the chordates to accept it but no it has to go to the plants where it belongs
The teachers are quaking
This made me self conscious of my breathing
My science teacher showed me this 😐
Teachers. I found something for you.
TOTALLY LOVE THIS UPGRADE!
Gets copyright claimed by like 100 music companies
All those how disliked they don't breath
This is BRILLIANT!!!
pentatonix is shook
"You are gonna die if you stop breathing" 🤣. Seriously though, these songs are awesome
With this who needs school?!
I literally just had an anatomy test on this last week I wish you posted this earlier 😂
I love how the original song is about anxiety and something about the line “ you are going to die if you stop breathing “ 
was very much anxiety inducing, for me anyway
i love this so much
When you realize that it’s just the two guys singing 😮😲😂
omg i have a science test in 2 days about breathing thank you so much im going to play this on repeat
this is gonna help in my biology exam, thanks lol
Can I have some ATP
this post was made by oxygen gang
This is such a fun idea.
this made my day, like for real
this is brilliant
the noobs u bullied in the roblox jailbreak
Hey hey 
Please. Do this for all the body systems 🙃
Guess who's gonna get an A on my biology test 🤚🤚🤚
welp now i know about "breathin"
Ohhhh u guys r brilliant 😂😂👏
This right here is great content
We had to watch this for my science class oml lol
easy yet enjoYable explanation of breathing mechanism!!
oml i didn’t read the whole thing and I was like “THIS IS THE ACTUAL SONG?! WOOOW”
#sciencespin let me love you or lean on
Omg I freakin love you guys.
I just watched this high AF - with a GameCube controller in my hand, and super smash bros starting up. This video is epic
Hummed this song during my biology exam
MITCHEL YOU SING SO GOOD
yo why is this lowkey fire
This is so underrated
You literally just animate facts that can be googled easily or are found in class 10 facts book
This single 2 minute 42 second video explains cell respiration, and how lungs work better than my highschool biology teacher.
The education system is failing me but ur videos aren’t!
ARİANA should watch this!!! :))
Please put on Spotify
They said “breathin” 22 times!!!!!
as an arianator and someone who enjoys their living env class. this is perfect
In My Blood by Shawn Mendes
WOW I have learned more in this video than I do in class.
0:50 Take a moment to pause and look at Greg's face xD
im showing this to my science teacher
This is such a bop
You should make a science parody of imagine by Ariana Grande about why the world is round 
And what life would be like if it were flat 
“Imagine a world that’s flat”
I think I like this better then the really version haha 😂
While watching this video I randomly stopped breathing wtf 😂
Oxygen approved!
Definitely recommending this to my science teacher
My life science students will love this!
Love this 😂😂😂😍😍
Legend this in portuguese
This is amazing
My teacher showed this to are class
CO2 has left the chat.
do you ever wonder what people put before when it says they've edited it?
It gets on my nerves, because they could of put a completely different thing.
Better than the original
Anyone else notice the multiple/multiply typo?
congrats for the most disliked video on youtube!
pentatonix has left the chat
Omg I literally have a health test about that body system on Thursday I really needed this 💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing job 😂🤘🏼
This is awesome! I showed my science class this and they were amazed! So was I
breathin' right now.
watching this with a stuffy nose
I love this! 😂 😂
Mama Mia by Queen
What would happen if the earth somehow collided with the moon or an adjacent plant?
I felt that voice crack at 1:00
ok showing this to my science teacher
It was too perfect of a title to pass up on a Science twist
This is amazing.
I learned more in this few minute video than a whole week of school.
They actually sound good😂😂😂Let me get my science teacher to put this on blast
What if in the future Oxygen will be paid monthy by us??
When Ariana Grande  puts AsapSCIENCE in charge of her Grammy performance
This video made me had to breathe manually
plz do 7 rings
Who's a better singer? Reply for Greg, Like for Mitch
(by the way, i am not trying to get likes!! I seriously just want to know because i like mitch better (as a singer) so please dont be upset in the replies ty)
im gonna like my own comment for mitch lol
😂😂this is so good
I must question this.
I listened to the actual song before this one but for some reason this one is stuck in my head
This is creepy but you can’t lie they can sing beautifully
This is an advertisement by Cooler Master
Here I am breathin' CO2 right now.
who else is breathing manually now
Yeah, Thanks for reminding me that Breathing can be manual.........
Imagine your Biology Teacher doing this :/
you are now aware of your own breathing
Where was this when I had my respiratory system quiz two weeks ago
Sir I need a song of digestion plsssss
i dont know half of the science vocabulary in this video, but i still liked
I stand by my previous comment. The blond dude secretly is a member of pentatonix.
Yay this will help me with my health project.
you are now breathing manually
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen. My nerd senses are tingling.
Do you know how lucky i am because tomorrow I have a test about the respiratory system 💗
trying to stop watching this is the froth time
Honestly such a good Video!
omg this is so amazing!!! i legit replayed it 10 times while i was doing science revision, please do more!! maybe like Freaky Friday - "i woke up in Chris Browns body" but to do with digestion or cells or something in the body idk???
those 1.1K who disliked have asthma
Co2 has left the blood
You should do a video on US debt
I want them to be my science teacher
How they do face reveal this year
Hahhha I can’t breathe 😂😂
When the class played this.
Make MORE LIKE THIS PLEASE
omg, that's really amazing idea!!!
I love this
This is what I needed
A song about geology and astronomy would be cool!!
I love asapscience
The what? The Who’s?
What about exhaling?
0:27 only time i realized that lyric was not original omg
I still cant get over this
Yasssss Adenosine Triposphate is energyyyy

My biology teacher would love this
thats hilarious thank u for existing
this video gave me life
This 10 times better than the original and it actually teaches you something. Well done guys.
I love thissss!!
I wish you are my science teacher
We need to learn science like this.
This is so extra
You will die if you stop breathing

Me: You don't say?
Oh god. My health teacher played this for us. Now its stuck in my head.

Thanks is the Netter way of learning anaromy and my English
THIS IS SICK
This should get more attention.
Omg this would’ve been soooo helpful if I have found this earlier as I had a science test on this YESTERDAY
There should be a song about ATP set to the tune of "O.P.P." by Naughty by Nature.
I was loveeeeee you guys...
you guys are soooo talented... like seriously who would have thought such a scientific song parody..n even your voice is amazing 😍😍😍
Mitch is actually a great singer
More he,paul than school

It could have been better 😞
Hahahahahahha i love you guys so much 😂😂😂
EVERYONE SHARE THIS ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIAS SO ARI WILL SEE IT

This was great!
Science has joined the chat, Ariana has left.
OMG so good!!!
You guys are sooo cool

I think they re speaking a different language
Lol I'm so cringed out
This is art!!!!

I'm watching while breathing
My favorite band.
I really like your songs 👌👌
Shook.
Hahahaha nerds, but things are going well for you, good for you
Mitch is a great singer!! ❤️❤️
I sent this to my science teacher
Love it how he sang "alveoli"
Where was this when I had a unit test on the human body
Thank you now I understand this!Your much beter than my teacher
Ariana Grande is Q U A K I N G
Great video! It made me laugh xD
Is it me or i didn't know most of the words they were saying cuz it's so much science😂
U guys need to make more of these they are so useful ! 😃❤
hahahaha this is so hilarious but so good
Now I love Science.
i probs wouldn’t have failed my exam if this song came out before then tbh
I don't know what to say
meagan maloney has entered the chat
I just did my biology test and all of this was in it 😭😭😭
aye nice those 770 dislikes don't have good taste in music
Can you plz do a song about the digestive system and cell biomes? 🙏
Lol this video has a better message than the original
My uncle qnd his boyfriend looks exactly like them
alright, convert this video to a .wma, put it on a flash drive and mail it back to when I was in Junior High.
Do a song about cells
Cringe level 100
Omg no😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This made me forget how to breathe
you two are good singers
Bro awesome<3
You are gonna die 








If you stop breathing
I feel like science and health teachers should show this instead of doing the work
😍😍make more songs like this
I love your voices!!
Damnnn, if I found this earlier my exam would pass with flying colors!
This song taught me more science than any teacher will
This is a bop.
I just became very aware of my own breathing... thanks guys :/
“You are gonna die if you stop breathin’ “
Watching this video inspired a question which my bio class in uni didn’t cover this semester: so, if CO2 is toxic to us, when you stop breathing is death caused by the toxicity of CO2 if we don’t expel it or because without the intake of oxygen we can no longer make ATP and our cells being to shut down? Basically, which kills us first in this situation?
Wow.. this was actually really good...
2:17 
" You're  gonna die, if you stop breathing "
Me: * eye twitch* ......what......the .........hell............. Have I just watched?........
why was this so good 😆
This is a bop
sounds good
This is a bop
when nerds get creative
I inhaled my spit when he said to breathe
i love this
You are now breathing manually.
I see 3 sell outs
I know I have heard this song before (like the real one) but I forgot what it was called if someone could tell me that would be great thanks
Can you guys do a video on the phycological side of being a fangirl? Being one myself I’m very interested as to why I literally get stomach aches when I look at Harry styles or Ben hardy
video sponsored by lays
Love it <3
Ariana is proud 😂
I would die if this accidentally played in my class because of auto play
I’m so shook right now. Smart and musically talented.
Please make more songs like this, it helps a lot!!!!
What a coincidence that this was in my recommended because I just learned about this in science class. (Lungs, trachea, bronchi, etc...)
I had a test last week, it would've been awesome if you realised it last week
I guess this is how people will remember their science facts
Teachers should just show this to the students
Glycolysis? The Link Reaction? The Krebs cycle? Oxidative phosphorylation? Disappointed. Lol jk, great song!
Ohh thats how you breathe         ._.
All Science discussions should be like this.
I feel like a genius.....
who else is breathing while watching this
Those lungs look a little... off
Nitrogen left the chat
Am I the only one that states breathing really heavily during the whole video?
Hit like if you're breathin and happy about that.🙂

Creeepy
if i were still in high school i feel like i wouldve made this for a science class lmao
This is too good

I have to compliment their singing for science guys
Why did this help me pass my biology exam
Love it! Thank you!
drag me down

I hope someone will make like this to programmer
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
We’re learning about air ways and my teacher used this
You guys probably spent more time writing this than Ariana did
He is actually a good singer
Who else was breathing while watching?

That was wonderfullllllllllll
do the female anatomy with God Is A Woman 😩
Nice!!
The lungs in this video look so cool. They look like painted pink paper bags
😂😂😂 i love it
Breathing is probably what I'm worst at. I have asthma and when I sleep I suffer from sleep apnea. so breating isn't my style
What is the name of the program you are using?

Im i the only one who feels the beats here sound better than the actuals beat
why does this slap???
Now I feel kind of weird...
Jus a genius
I wish I Iearn like that in the school(love Sciences🔬🔭⚗️)
Who else was breathing while watching this video?
For some reason for me I freak out at night more and feel more comfortable having deep conversations and more existential thoughts. Is it just me or is there a reason for it? Thanks
So when's the album coming?
We love a breathin Queen
i wish this song was around when i took my year 8 science test
You snapped!
Genius
You dont even deserve that much screen time on YT rewind
I dont breath when i am in the water....haha awesome vid
tweet  ariana grande,😂😂
Ugh you made me aware of my own breathing god dammit
Im learning this in science rn
this song sounds like it would be good in the background of a scene where the hero is struggling to stay alive and this is his motivation to keep breathing
you are now aware of your own breathing
Co2 is not toxic .
Breathing song is relatable for people with athsma
Pentatonix
what scientists hear when listening to a song
I have Cystic Fibrosis. . .
I am breathing for this
YES.
why do we get hiccups
Best song
great job!
1060 people stopped breathing.
ARIANA GRANDE WHO???
Well... I feel awkward breathing while watching this video smh.

0:50 lovely
lol omg
Ariana, look out, you got tough competition
This video was sponsored by our body
I have one question. What are the chances of getting pregnant in different situations? Like if the man ejaculates during the woman's period, or after 2 days, or the chances for a condom to break, and what types of condoms are the best for no risk. And also, if possible, another question, what is the best way to make pleasure to a girl, so there are fewer chances of faking an orgasm? Thanks, you are the best guys!!
breathes
I didn't see it was only 2 guys singing until minute 2:40
Best singers ever lol

Make a song on quantum mechanics !!
I wish I had a science teachers like this, this is the only way I’ll listen and maybe pass my tests.
0:10 really scared me bcs in Malaysia theres a ghost like that and we called it "Langsuir" go search it
When you need to learn science but you are too lazy so you listen to this song

Kanye did a better job with breath in breath out
Was I the only one who thought Ariana Grande was gonna be in the video?
Scott Hoying is that you?
They’re so cute!
Why'd it take me half way through the video to realize there are only 2 people in it
Beautiful
While I understand using the word "palpitation"  for a rhyming device in the song, they are usually transient events and not the normal way blood is circulated by a healthy heart under most circumstances.
Wonder how much cringe
Omg!
this ruined this song for me
Ckraks
Aaaa love itttttt

Just in time for my heart and lungs test on Monday :D
I'm crying I love this more than I should, I need to show this to my science teacher 😂
I needed this for my bio test on Tuesday 😩hopefully I still got it right
Had two test about this yesterday that timing
This is genius. Nuff said.
This is magnificent
DEAD I LOVEEEEEEEEEE
You guys are so awesome. 😊
Idk this song but am happy to hear this version! Maybe you could get into some metal or alt rock (at least the classic kind like The Smiths, Depeche Mode, Pantera, Metallica)? I'd stop breathing from the laughter & enjoyment I'd feel but it'd be worth it! 😁
I like how they went creative with this sing
SOOO GOOD
This depresses me as a smoker
EPIGLOTTIS FLAP STOPS A TUBE MISHAP 😂😂😂

Hey ASAP Science, i am in the 9th grade and your videos like this are highly helpful in remembering stuffs coz your songs are kinda catchy, so, i request u to make more of these videos. Thankyou :)
ICONIC, SHOOK
All the dislikes were from carbon dioxide

Hopefully this video doesn't simply make you stressed about being stressed! Haha 
Thanks for watching :)
So you are not meant to be stressed Everyday?
Wait... So being stressed isn't supposed to be part of a daily routine? Tell that to every detail of my life
School=exams=stress=cancer


Exams=cancer.  
School=cancer 

Hence proved
I'm watching this while being stressed every day. Glad to hear I'm going to die young! :)
It’s called the phenomenon called “School”
What do you mean “what if” lol
This video stressed me out
milennials knee slap and cackling in the distance
What if?
I am always stressed out. Why is that even a question lol.

Guess I should just lie down and die already lol.
Great!
Now I am stressed about being stressed.
Guess I'll die.
Dont you mean, what happens when you’re in school everyday?

Oh wait


We are
So school is literally killing me.
Yeah let me just not be stressed, thanks bro very cool. I dont know why i didnt think of this sooner 😲😲😲
Any students around here? Yeah, I feel ya..
Waking Up?    Stressed

Getting Ready for school?  Stressed

School?   

Going back home?   

Hotel?   
“What if” Funny.
Glad to hear i'm gonna die soon
Guess I’ll die
What if you get stressed every day? Then your life would be like mine.
“What if your stressed every day”? 

Then it’s a normal day I guess
Well, it means you're a University student... Simple.
Do my homework earlier instead of procrastinating and giving into my You Tube addiction?
How’d you guys find a picture of me for the thumbnail?

Edit: Holy crap. I can't handle the fame. Thanks for the likes
Who are these lucky people who can ask questions like this? This the norm for too many of us.
Why'd you have to waste your talent on that dumpster fire youtube rewind
this video literally explains why i should drop out of school
Me: *taps the middle of my glasses as my eyes glow*
Yes, yes i am.
After work I smoke a joint. Don't feel stressed for the rest of the day
*what if you were in college?
Damn it, showing me the health issues makes me stressed
just come to my university, we are the best examples of everyday stress
What If channel like AsapScience Didn't Existed On Youtube??😆
“What if you’re  stressed everyday”
 Me- stresses about what would happen
"What if"? You underestimate my power....
There was a study about stress that showed that if you dont think about stress as a bad thing it reduces the harmful effects of the stress reaction. I think people think about stress as a bad thing so much that they get stressed about being stressed. The study shows that people who can think of stress as a good thing (since its there to protect you from threats, maximize your bodys performance and to allow you to use a lot of energy in a short period of time) experienced less symptoms of stress and for example their blood pressure didnt go up when put in a stressful situation. Also, according to an online poll about stress people who thought of it as a bad thing and said they are stressed often had higher death rates in the next few years and the ones who didnt think of stress as a bad thing but were still stressed often had lower death rates that were about the same as the people who told they arent stressed very often.
I meditated during this video 😇✌️🙏🏻
AsapScience: What if you were stressed everyday?
Me: First Time?
sees title


Lol me everyday
Sad boy, lonely,  aesthetics, I hate my life.
Me: This is me.
My mental issues: YASS QUEENNN
That’s not a question, it’s a fact.
Hey asap science?
Can u guys answer why I have a hard time sleeping every night?
Btw I also live in Canada!

What If You Are Stressed Everyday? 
Me: I am.
Yep,
Just a regular day in Med School
bruh the ending of this video just gave me stress argh just tell me!!!
having kids = stress for the next 20 years
"What if you are stressed everyday?" WHAT DO YOU MEAN "IF" LMAO
Why people are stressed:
1. The golden law of capitalism is profit seeks the lowest cost of labour. Which means
a) Employers stagnate wages as best they can and bring cheap labour to the jobs, but if unable
b) Employers send the jobs abroad but if unable,
c) Automation

2. Capitalism prevents democracy in 70% of life, which we spend at work. The only choice a worker has is to go to another job where the same top down anti democratic relationship exists.

3. Under our current system, the few employers are given the right to take the value everyone produces per hour and decide what to do with it with no input from the workers. Those at the top give the worker back a dribble and pocket the rest via large pay increases, dividends and rent.

4. Employers then hand these wages to institutions called hedge funds who manage the money of the wealthy, some of which the hedge funds lend to banks, who lend to workers, who take the money with a smile as their wages have gone no where fast for 40 years. Effectively, employers globally by proxy have been loaning their workers the wage rises they should have gotten, to be repaid in full with interest. A global hustle that worked well until enough failed to repay that it caused a collapse of capitalism and the symptom of financial crisis.

5. There is no end in sight to the erosion of the economic conditions of most in the bottom 70% of a given advanced nation. So they break left and right in search of anyone promising change without really understanding just what changes are needed and why few politicians are offering such changes. The left rightly blames capitalism, the centrists say all is fine, the right blames migrants / muslims / jews / insert minority, to deflect blame from capitalism and the media backs the right and centrists up, as do the wealthy who own politicians and media of both sides, simultaneously, in order to distract people from the message of the left, and crush them. Resulting in fascism unchallenged, taking office all over the world.

6. Everyone is stressed due to the above points, which you can see in increasing suicide rates, increasing child mortality, decreasing life spans, increasing poverty rates, increasing inequality, skyrocketing anti depressant usage, and the occasional drug abuse epidemic, such as opioids.

7. Capitalism is also incompatible with solving climate change. No matter how many solar panels and electric cars we throw at it. 
The fun fact that I can share with you, people in the comments, is that I had for a year a really stressful job and I experienced a lot this effects (anxiety, sleep depravation, gained a few kg...).
I knew that I was stressed cause the job made it looks obvious.

But now, In a new job, much more easy and relaxed to do, I don't feel like stressed, but I am!!
Just had a few heart exams and I got anxiety, sleep depravation, and low depression again.

It fun part is that I wasn't feeling stressed cause I was comparing my actual situation with my past self
“what if”
I've had anxiety & depression since I was like 9 or 10, I'm now 21. Honestly smoking weed helps sooooo much.
I feel like I just watched a two and a half minute ad for your podcast.





And it makes me so streeesssss—no.
Wake up: Stress

Go to school: Stress

Come back home: Stress


Hotel: Trivago

How to decrease stress:
Buy less expensive things, work less, have more free time
Hi, love your videos. They are so informative, and I especially appreciate you linking references and further readings. 
Are your podcasts available on Spotify?
Smoking weed helps 💁🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️
Me: *watches the video*




Me: guess ill die
What do you mean “what if”?! I am already stressed all day, everyday!
Our physics teacher told us we lose brai cells and we can lose our memory.
Tbh i dont even kniw what that means
Both asapscience and life noggin uploaded a video about stress today...
Thank you for asking, I want to rest.
Woah 
Life noggin posted a similar video...
Welp. Now I'm stressed about how stressed I am. Noice
saw you on youtube rewind, WE NEED MORE SCIENCE!!
Um what do you mean what if? I already stress everyday
At school we had to do a 10 minute speech, and I was first and let me tell you it was stressful
Nothing stresses me more than being redirected to someone' f---ing podcast for the answers that should have been in the video.

This video stressed me out about me being stressed out all the time 😩
It's not "what if" it's "I am".
Omg, I've been having an affair with stress for the past year. 😖😖
Ahhh, so this is my problem.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

Think positive! There’s always a reason to be alive, and life is worth living!
This video is now making me stress out about being stressed😂
Congrats On the YouTube rewind feature
The question would be "what if I'm not stressed for one single day?"
Hmmm weird how life noggin posted the exact same kind of video 7 hours ago 🤔
This is making me even more stressed
Ok well now I'm more stressed about being stressed so that's cool
"what can you even do to lower your stress levels?"

Drop out. Quit my job. 
Problem solved.
Jokes on you I’m always stressed
I had stress of school everyday, but when I finally lets say "gratuated" I went to another school and that was a mental cure for me!! 😀
Also see: "graduate school"
Now convince the capital class of this.

For fight and flight, my reaction is to just freeze and drop why????
One word:

What if you were stressed everyday?
You’d be like me. Ain’t that depressing
Pffft fr I'm stressed about not having anything to worry about
I'm a bus driver in London  Very stressful job I need to change things
The answer is you want sleep, but can’t. You know what else is true?

Please don't kill me from jealousy...
What if you are stressed *every day

But I guess this isn't AsapGRAMMAR.
I wouldn’t wish months of stress on anyone, even rats ffs
what if you're stressed every day? you become me
Well great now this videos got me stressed about dying young cause apparently stress kills
The good thing is you can control and reduce stress! A simple thing would be doing meditation!
But Stress is part of the journey especially if you're working on a big goal, this is why I've started Youtube to help you achieve your goal!
Um that what if has a word
A n x i e t y
Remove the ‘what if’ part lmao
Holy shit! Are you guys reading my mind? Literally, I have been under stress for two weeks now and this video comes out. Loved it btw.
Thanks. I'm more stressed now.😥
WHAT IF YOU ARE ME EVERYDAY
I wouldn't be surprised if I've been stressed since day 1
That explains why I got sick so easier
What if you are me everyday
I'm student bro






Stress is my second name
Funny thing is because I am everyday.

Like is one relate
lol at students







wait till you get married!
Me when I saw the title of the video: "Oh my god. ASAP Science just did a video about me."
I was born stressed.
Stress Squad, sound off!
Sees Youtube rewind 2018..






i want to die.
Wow, a video about my life...
What if stress makes you breathe slower instead of quicker. When I'm stressed I end up holding my breath without knowing it
Welp looks like the only things left for me is heart problems, fertility issues, memory loss and cancer. Everything else-been there, done that 🤷🏽‍♀️🙃
THIS WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT I WAS JUST A REALLY BAD PERSON ONCE I CAME TO MY NEW SCHOOL BUT I WAS STRESSED ?!
Explains a lot...
Explains why when I worked 2 jobs I lost my short term memory and some of my hearing.
Now im stressed about being stressed, :D yeay.
I mean, I guess stress is also relative though. Let's say you just finished a really big and important project for work that was extremely stressful, everyday stress from like client call or unreasonable boss suddenly seems less stressful and kinda just "oh just another normal day". The more stress you experience, the less those "everyday stress" become, and your tolerance level for stress increases LOL. I am going to cry now.
What if???

I..already am-
Damnit, im not even 18 yet and im always stressed. Just wait until im an adult. Cancwr will be waiting like 
"Sup😕👍"
Now I’m going to be stressed about being too stressed...
What if? Nah man , everyday is an understatement
Meditation is "THE" way!!😉
this is literally every high school/college student
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't supposed to be stressed all the time???
"what if" okay buddy
You should do a vid on the stress in students
Guys first off, I love your videos and everything you do in general.  Not al heroes wear cape, although I have a feeling Greg would look fabulous in one! Having said that, I remember Robert Sapolsky explicitly saying that stress causes or influences a plethora of illnesses but cancer is NOT one of them. There are a lot of so called experts earning money by claiming they can change the course of cancer through stress management. Can you double check that maybe. Tons of love and happy holidays ❤
I'm stressed everyday, and when i'm not, i'm nervous that i'm forgetting something important making me stressed
HAHAHAHAHHA I LAUGHED AT THIS WHEN I SAW THE THUMBNAIL. I LOVE UNIVERSITY
Don't stress everyone! It will get better
Stress everyday? So basically me every second ❤️😑
"what if" lmao
Jokes on you this is everyday life ha.. ha
Knowing all these facts about stress make me more stressed
"What if you were stressed everyday?"
Yes. I am.
Whenever your stressed think of it as your body helping you to take on that stressor
I manage depression stressfully lol It's a vicious cycle of self hatred
That title is the story of my life Except what if
Did you and life noggin plan on releasing similar videos at the same times?
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything!
Hah i am stressed everyday🤨
Watching this during finals makes me stressed.
So this like old question “would you rather meet your soulmate or find out how you die” 

I guess I picked how I’ll die. 😑
What do you mean by "What IF..."
That's my entire life compressed into 2 minutes and 29 seconds
With PTSD, I have fight and flight occurring often. It’s not a fun thing to have.
actual title: This is how your body acts all the time.
“what if” you were stressed every day


i am the stress.........
Is this "Stress Day" or something? I saw a similar video in Life Noggin today.
Im actually surprised how most of the points said actually are true for me
I appreciate the video about my life.
That mouse was really sad when that bird snatched its mate up. :(
What if... I am?
Then u need to hop on my wave. I survived cancer twice and lost half my face to amputation.. a tumor destroyed my jaw and changed everything.. I was labeled a freak. I decided to start over, travel South America and start a youtube channel to inspire others who feel ugly and not good enough for this world.. it's all about energy and mindset.. my scars will not define me. with optimism and positive projection you can overcome any mental or physical hurdle. self love from within overpowers any physical shell! go check me out and subscribe if you want to help me grow. i want to give people a spark of change and join me on my journey!
This makes me stressed about being stressed every day
I wish you'd given tips om decreasing stress through science in this video and not linked to an hour-long podcast 🙁
My tip is for everyone to read Johann Hari's book "Lost Connections".
It pretty much "debunks" SSRI's (and similar drugs), puts depression/stress/anxiety less as a chemical thing and more a psychological thing.
finally, a video about me
Do one about the physiology of workers under an abusive boss.
Problem is my cognitive functions have severely declined and that's what I'm currently stressing about. Guess I'll die then.
!? Life nogin also had a vid about stress???
Umm...there is no "what if"....
We are.Stressed.Every.Day....
I laughed out loud when I saw the title of the video. "What if" HAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'S A HOOT!! XD
The science of twins and just multiples in general
I am stressed everyday! :"D
Hold my kvass
Smoking weed is great for stress!
Tip: Just don't be stressed.
I got so stressed about money, and never recovered up to this point. It became chronic because I developed it as a habit. I accepted it, mistaking stress and worry as part if adulthood. 

It takes great effort to break out of it. It’s like a constant battle with yourself. And the moment you loose focus, you’re back at the habit again. The key that sometimes work for me is to be examine your own thoughts. Observe thoughts and emotions and just let it run through you. Never let it consume you. You have to control how you react, and remember you are not your emotions and thoughts. Then you’ll get a greater sense of being. And for a brief moment your life will make sense...
this video stresses me out
I have only one adrenal gland and it is out of control. I am continually stressed but my cortisol levels are low. There's other hormones that the adrenals pump out that stress us too
2:00 me, i got MG (auto immune ) because of stress .

I’m literally stressing over not being to stressed. That’s how stressed I am •-•
I'm stressed everyday my mom is an abusive alcoholic who lies and tries to throw people in jail by lying using the feminist card this person is a danger to everyone she meets she even threw all of our groceries away everyday is pure hell
This is making me even more stressed.
Marijuana kills —> cancer

= smoke weed every day
Fight, flight or freeze. Freezing is similar but with no hope in mind for survival. (in)famous examples include a deer in the headlights or a falling goat. Humans can get this as well and the immobilization it can cause is hard to describe.
Jokes on you I already am stressed every day
Fantastic video! It took me a while to learn about the impact of stress because I thought it was normal and even expected if you want to be successful. I hit a breaking point when I worked at a high stress job. I had gained a significant amount of weight, felt tired all day everyday, developed digestion issues (IBS) and  experienced general anxiety and dissatisfaction. I can't say it was 100% stress related but I know when I made some real changes, alot of that went away. I made it my mission to learn more and now as a health coach, I'm able to work with others to find relief and get the their energy back and health on track. Chronic stress doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be) present in your life. Take time to acknowledge what's causing you to stress out and why. Perception plays a big role. Try different methods of stress relief and take care of yourself. 💜
Ughhhhhh I hate being stress everyday 😕🙁🙁 what's a good way to get rid of stress ????
Stress doesn’t cause cancer!
If you already have cancer, chronic stress is likely to make cancer progression worse.
Don’t confuse the two
Stress? Is that some kind of sauce?

I'm always anxious ,bored,terrible, crazy, tired, lifeless, frustrated😤😤😤😤
Dear AsapSCIENCE,

It's 'every day', not 'everyday'.

Thanks.
I have stressed so much in the past few years in starting to have heart issues :D 

I’m struggling to breath, dealing with pain and school.

So here’s the lesson: life sucks
Glad I smoke weed (not everyday)
I didn't know I was stressed until now.
I mean, I was looking only at the effects: my blood pressure escalated in the past few months, along with increase in weight, non sleeping ( I go to sleep really late, sleep 2~3h, wake up and sleep another 3h in the afternoon), sickness (it looks like I got the cold twice this year... I heard you can only get once a year, is that a myth? Anyway...), struggle to focus/ remember things... I have it all.
Of course, I need to see a doctor to be sure, don't worry. I'm just lazy AF to go to a doctor.
Are you Life Noggin?
Boy that was stressful 😪
Video Idea: What do antidepressants do to your body/brain?
That's my secret... I'm always stressed
You should do a video on the difference between being anxious (the emotion) and generalised anxiety disorder (the disability) and how they effect people differently
Great now I'm stressing out about being stressed and how much brain damage I'm going to sustain.
Your thumbnail and title have the wrong form of “everyday”. Everyday one word is an adjective while you were trying to use the “every day” form
"what if"
Ahahaha ahaha
Now I'm stressed about my stress, thanks!
W H A T I F 





ITS EVERYDAY
We haven't evolved to deal with this aspect of civilization.  See: "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers", by Robert Sapolsky.
Welp, i'm dead.
Can you guys do a video about the science behind grinding your teeth when you're asleep?
This video stressed me out
This taught me nothing. I am already stressed everyday.
So 200% of the student population
It builds up over time, until you can’t sleep and have to go on prescription medications. You will feel horrible. You’ll do all this research online to figure out what supplements you need to start taking. You’ll loose a lot of weight, and feel fatigued all day long. You’ll have a lot of anxiety. Your mind will be tested. Don’t tell yourself this is the end. Tell yourself that you’re going to seek help and things will get better. Then reach out and get some help. I recommend you go immediately to your doctor. But if you can’t, then try to go to a health foods store and pick up some over the counter sleep aids like melatonin and valerian, stress relief, and anxiety relief. There are many things that you can take that will work. Most things require some time to work, so be patient with them.
I live in a very toxic household. I've been stressed everyday since the age 12. Its been hard. I can barely function anymore. I'm 18 my brain feels tore apart :(
What if????????!!???!?!!!!!?
Well done on the YouTube rewind 2018
this video personally spoke to me on so many levels wow
lol "what if"
Have you ever looked at thing link of stress to the lgbt+ community and how often they experience chronic stress?
This video only made me more stressed
Every adults are stressed of getting caught cheating.
Ahhh, so this is what it's like to be a lawyer
Unfortunately can confirm. Chronic high stress gave me permanent high blood pressure issues, extremely poor memory, and generalized anxiety disorder. All of these contributed to the destruction of two personal relationships and put the in the hospital multiple times. The only solve became to leave my job. I'm now at another company and very happy with significantly lower stress levels. The damage done to my mind, body, and stress regulation will likely never heal, but at least I've prevented further damage. Don't let this happen to you. If you can, in any way, leave a situation of chronic stress, do so ASAP. Don't wait like I did until you're hospitalized for a massive panic attack. 🖤
There’s a difference between being stressed and having problems people... you aren’t stressed every day, we all have problems.
Smoking some weed will help with that
Can you get blind from stress?
please make a "bad make up science" video with Safiya
Me nowdays :((
This explains everything
so how do i not be stressed if school expects me to do my best everyday
you forgot to mention your hair falls out giving you bold spots i have them every time i get my finals but luckily my hair grows back
Life noggin made a video on stress 3 hours before this video was made, and 6 hours ago for me.
I’m so sorry you guys did the YouTube rewind. Only YouTubers I even knew in that video.
The thumbnail is making me feel stressed! 😟
The thumbnail makes me sad 😢
What if you were stressed everyday?*
i was legit born with low adrenal count so it’s hard for me to get stressed which is an honest gift from God cuz the rest of my family has really bad anxiety and stress problems. it would be so cool if u could do a vid on benefits of adrenalin or little adrenalin
Lol I'm stressing out even more due to the information it can possibly damage my body and brain when I'm stressed :D
How do you stress a rat out?🧐
This should be re titled what happens when you go to school
this just makes me more stressed ?
I'm not stress, I'm just normal! ;)
Two hours ago I talked to my parents about stress. This was the first in my reccomended.
I'm scared.
School only teaches me that my homework is more important then my mental health
only watched this video to make sure i wasn’t going to die because this is no longer a what if
I'm stressed and after watching this I want to jump off the balcony . Bbye guys ..
Well, I already know it'll kill me a lot faster, but I don't expect to live a long life anyways. So...I suppose I'm okay with that.
You using "Everyday" instead of "Every Day" stresses me out.
This video got me more stressed of being stressed everyday.
Posted this a few days before college finals week ...
um I'm already stressed everyday wdym
And here's more proof that school is trying to kill us
"What if" hA hA fUNnY
me since 1990
My guy, all you need to do is try and get a PhD in physics
Thumbs up if this explains everything
“What if” ha
even after being a doctor, this stress in gonna kill me.. it already has killed my personality
Now I'm stressed about being stressed!
So I’m not diagnosed but I think I have anxiety, not watched the video yet but these are the kinds of things I’ve noticed.
My skin and hair have got a lot worse
My hands and feet are always cold (I think because blood is pulled away from extremities when you’re stressed) 
I binge eat a lot
My jaw aches from grinding my teeth
I get dehydrated all the time from sweating
Fun 😬
Engineers - So its our routine
Bold of you to assume I'm not already
What if? More like how much more time
“what happens when you are stressed everyday?” 

then it is like every other day lol
This is why I hate college lol, society and my parents make me feel like I have to be there lol (I’m only 18).
Also I feel bad for the drawn woman on the thumbnail even though she’s not real because I have sympathy lol
Every highschool teen who decided to take multiple college classes. 0:00
All these 10 yo in comment section are complaning about school work. They haven't faced the real life yet.
Why isn’t there a cure for asthma?
We live in a self-depreciated society and it makes me sick
Your copying Life Noggin
First
life noggin and asap do the same topic on the same day???
Thanks for reassuring me that not going to med school was a good idea, since I really don't want a high stress career.
heavy breathing
1:59 couldn’t have drawn a better picture myself...
Lmao what do you mean “if”
What if u constanly felt pleasure?
So basically life with anxiety
Yep, I’m stressed every single day.
welcome to my life. what happens when stress lasts years? my brain ruled out flight as a possibility long ago, its all fight now. i drop unconscious from exhaustion at 4am and wake up and do it all over again at 7am, i don't count this as sleep since it's never voluntary.
Reads title it's not what if. It's the story of my Life.
I fell like people have turned being stressed into a competition
I'm too stressed to watch this video
Can u please answer that is taking tests extremely frequently (like a test after every topic) good for students? Why has Japan banned tests in schools till 4rth grade?? Please answer and I love it channel👍
Smoke some weed to relief yourself from stress 😂😂
gets more stressed after watching video
What can you do to reduce stress if you are an incel?
I think many have a broad idea of the word stress...
Love your channel! Please consider getting a better microphone!
The title sounds so familiar 😥
All this video did was stress me out
"What if"? Dude
Married father of three has left the room, forever!
Congratulations you guys were in YouTube rewind!
My favourite part was when you guys and Safiya Nygard melted lipstick 
but the rest of the video was weird
My battery is at 2%
THIS VIDEO IS STRESSING ME OUT
Hard to be stressed when you're unconscious. I can thank weed for what little sleep I get 👏
I feel personally attacked
How do I even know if I'm stressed.
Yayyyyyyy! The narrator is back!
There is a third threat response not spoken of in society.   The fight or flight but also the freeze response.  Leading To curable DPDR
Every teenager ever: LOL!
This explains a lot...
Been there...stress is horrible! You have to endure the immediate stress, then also the after-effects. Much more can happen if the body is under stress, such as hair loss or cortisol physically degrade the body's organs.
i am stressed everyday 😘😘
I'm feeling more stressed after watching this.
Great stuff! We always recommend 3 big ways to cope with stress:

1. Reduce your stressors (if you can). To do this, list all your stressors and put checks by the ones you can take care of later or just get rid of altogether.
2. Increase your coping. Coping strategies are things you do, or could do, to help you reduce your stress!
3. Change your thinking. Most stress is simply about the meaning of stress. Changing your thinking won't eliminate stress, but it can reduce the "weight" of the stress.

None of these will make all your stress disappear, but they can help you cope a lot better. When you deal with stress, you build emotional muscle and that makes you more resilient.
This is why everyone is mean. We’re all stressed. Let’s hope 2019 can lighten up and we all release a little stress  
Let’s just bring back FRANKIE SAYS RELAX
This question is probably asked by folks with no kids.  With kids = Stress for the next 18 to 30 years
Now I feel stressing after seeing that thumbnail face
Answer: you are me.

My main reason of stress is school
This is my life,






Like if u cry😭😭
What if? There's an option not to be?
well, i guess im not living past 30
Oh wow I didn’t know they did a draw my life for me!
hmm, life noggin and ASAP Science uploading videos on stress on the same day. Is there something I'm not aware of?
Holy shit I love the comment section
This stressed me out
Oof I never realized how stressed I always am....
Oof same day as life noggin
So basically my life with anxiety.
thumbs down for saying "whether it be"
this video came out right in the midst of finals season
I really like your videos but can yall do a video on vocal fry? Mitch and Greg but do vocal fry and it is not very fun to listen to.....
thanks, freshman year of high school
Imma show this to my teacher next time he gives me a big homework assignment
can we talk more about panic attacks?
Imagine what kind of experiment did those mice go through... So disturbing
Lol "what if"
Back to normal epsiodes... FINALLY!!
A level students left the group chat!
I think you should tone it down a notch with the thumbnails
This is bad news for all those easily triggered ppl
Guys Science has proved that the only  way of preventing Stress is only by Communism !
How does the drawing at the end look exactly like you guys?
This video makes me stressed.
Yep, I've been through all of those stages due to stress...still waiting for cancer....
I have chronic stress and now I have ibs for the rest of my life
Bold of you to assume that this isn’t already happening.
I’ve been stressed since 10
This is literally me. It’s gotten to the point where I have an average resting heart rate of 120 simply from stress.
Were you on BBCAN?! I’m just now connecting the dots
Number 1 way to reduce stress. Watch hours of youtube.  






jk, i suggest watching self help youtube to make better lifestyle choices. Then actually delete your youtube and never watch again. Delete social media and phone apps. Switch to a flip phone from a smart phone. get an mp3 player for tunes. Walk, socialize in real life. get adequate sleep(no screen means better sleep), eat healthy whole food fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, beans, etc.. Also a big one is getting rid of unneccessary possessions/possessions you dont use. Donate, recycle, compost. yada-yada. good luck, Sorry about the stress my post causes you.
I’ve never been stressed in my life
Ive been stressed and depressed for over 2 years now😧 I don't know what I'm doing with my life
i dont need to watch, i already know what if
Hahaha if. Good one
Two words: exercise and meditation
Already knew what the comments would be before even clicking the video
Gee, what timing since it's finals week
Literally my life everyday
You just become one with the stress. So it no longer affects you
Is this a call out
I wonder what it feels like to not be stressed everyday
I got stressed watching this
But what about the body becoming used to carious amounts of stress? Sort of like exposure therapy? I've had plenty of instances where people around me were in full panic mode, but I certainly did feel the same. Sure differences in personality would affect that to an extent, but do we have research?
Is nobody gonna mention how their thumbnails are gradually looking creepier?
Could you please do a video on smart homes and how they will change things?
I'm stressed after watching YouTube rewind...
Oh. Well then I guess I should be dead by now  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Question : How to stress out the rats?

I started taking Ashwagandha capsules: 400mg BID. Anyone used this before? So far my results are decent after 3 days.
Lol “what if” I already do that I’m in Hugh school it’s a real thing
This video on stress makes me stress about the stress that I stress about

When I'm stressed I don't eat... Which I Stress Starve lmao
People with no common sense stress me out.🎶wish i could go back to the good old days.
Great so now I have to be stressed about being stressed.
Wow when you are so stressed you get more stressed watching a video about what this stress is doing to your health
We call it depression I believe
now i'm gonna be stressed about being stressed
When this video makes you stressed.
So high school is gonna kill me. Kewl!
Anyone can feel stressed out if they saw the thumbnail.
Don't worry I'm used to it I go school...
Just watching this got me stressed
My tactic to reduce stress was Vaping but then I saw your What vaping does to the brain video.
C-PTSD patient here.  It's bad...  That's all.
What if I wasn’t stressed everyday
This video is making me stressed about stress
I have anxiety so yeh. I AM stressed every day. Every second of every day of every week of every month of every year. YAY.
Ah cool so my crippling depression is likely from that ... Nice... Nice...
I think you will explode 💥
Stress is insane. I was going through 30+ hour work weeks, university with exams every week and a break up of a 2 year relationship that came out of nowhere while I just moved to a new city where everything was an hour away. My stress levels got so high I felt like I was going to explode. What's crazy is that when I went into the doctors, I was physically 100% fine. I felt like absolute shit cause I haven't slept in days, and I barely had an appetite to eat, and I was basically shaking from being so overwhelmed, but to hear I was fine just blew me away. Stress sucks. It's such an invisible problem.
Already am sis
It’s weird how you can be stressed from weight but gain weight from being stressed 




Life weird
anyone notice that life noggin and Asap science both made a video on stress today...
Here how you combat stress smoke a joint or two and feel the stress melt away
I saw you gentlemen in the Youtube Rewind, representing Canada :)
this made me stressed
Me being stressed everyday since i was 6: “guess I’ll die.”
Watching this video stressed me out.
I'm stressed everyday so what do you mean what if?
what do you mean what if??? I literally am
My life is a constant stream of stress sooo...I'm gonna die
Jokes on you i do stress everyday
I got finals next week too!
Oh no. Video is on 0:03 and I’m genuinely freaking out because I’m expecting this video to remind me of my weakened immune system due to the cortisol produced when my anxiety is being a d***. Hhhhhhh....

Edit: holy crap I was correct but like wtf being anxious is why I’m dumb now? Like that’s just what I took from this video. I had to stop going to school due to my anxiety and I thought my memory was suffering purely because I wasn’t stimulating my brain enough but it’s probs got a lot to do with being anxious every day also. Disappointing.
How do you stress out a mouse??? 😂😂
Good thing finals only last for 1-2 weeks lol
What If You Weren't Stressed Everyday*
The story of my life
As one who had worked in US and now working in Taiwan, I would say working environment in Asia is much more stressful than in US.
When ur off duty, ur really not 'truly' off duty. Ur boss will message u tons of shit and tasks and make u keep working when ur home. Of course it's illegal, and of course the penalty is nothing for employers.
dont play dota2 when u stress,, please..
Haha guys look at me i AM stressed everyday, I’m so unique!
I am stressed everyday
Wait..so I'm not supposed to be stressed everyday?
Death is always near.
I’m stressed everyday 😭
I stressed everyday freshman year because college prep school that I was going too supported stress so they have more and more work
Thanks college
If you are watching this video....you are already in stress
Stresses about stressing too much
What if???? Ha. Ha. Haha
Saw you in Rewind . I now love you.
Hahaha yeah “what if”....
If im concious and thinking, i am stressed. Facts.
Omg its a documentary on my everyday life!
But they won't decrease the 40 hour work week
0:15
Or freeze
heh... wow... can’t imagine being stressed every day... nope...
Life’s short, smoke a port!
I'm stressed from a toxic school and family, no wonder I'm fat and depressed
Every waking second of my life is like 10,000 eternities in hell.
Stress can cause heart disease and cancer?






Well. I’m screwed.
I smoke weed to get rid of stress, 

Tell me what should I do!!
Hm, good video but it kinda felt like in order to get any value from it one must follow into the next so ... it’s not whatsoever click bait by any means but ... chain link trickery... like making us watch more of your videos when you know if we watched this one we are already bad of ... not cool, taking advantage...
Don't you mean exams at school at the end of the year time?
Then you, my friend, are a student.
I think I should write my will now
So...wait....are there people who genuinely AREN'T stressed every day? Between work, finances and everything else, every daylife is an absolute stress fest.
I have short-term memory loss due to stress. That's... not permanent, is it...?
What if you were not stressed every day?
I'm already stressed every day.
This stressed me
Stay blessed never stressed
Major depression disorder is genetic. Mix MDD with stress and you have suicide.
Life itself is STRESS
At this point I wish some other egg was chosen from my mom's ovaries and not me.
Life is full of so many rules. Why can't we be born and just do whatever the hell we want. I mean from moment babies are born expectations are placed on them and are compared with the rate of other babies.When will the walk,talk etc. From there it is you  go to school for the next 18+ years , then get job, work, get married, have kids etc. I am sick of this cycle. If you can't keep up with this cycle you are shamed by society.All i want to do is explore the world , I don't care about wealth or how much another person is able to memorize and regurgitate . True learning is through the process of experiences NOT sitting behind a desk for the next 50+ years. Human's can't even truly enjoy and appreciate life because they are always worried about the next step.
Well you become me
Sounds like we are not meant to be stressed everyday, but we all are in fact stressed everyday. So, this is a problem similar to global warming that we have to take on as a collective and not individually. Alas, the US government is busy playing the partisan blame game instead of actually working for the good of the country and more importantly the health of every citizen.
Now im stressed about being stressed
smoke a blunt if you’re stressed
I was constantly stressed for four years because of school! One of the many things it affected was my sleep. I would go to sleep at 2 or 3am and have to get up at 6am for school. The stress was so bad that my hair started falling out! I was almost borderline diagnosed with alopecia. Now that I have graduated and the stress is gone, I go to sleep by 9:30! My hair is naturally growing back without any creams or vitamins my doctor prescribed. I do ,however, feel like as if I almost have ptsd. I never was an anxious person but since I graduated I get anxious sometimes for the smallest things. Stress is a horrible thing :/ but I am so much happier now and in a better mental state than I was while in school. There is a light at the end of the tunnel my fellow students!
So glad I changed jobs. The constant stress really made me lose it a little and I still don’t feel quite the same after almost a year.
#ToFarGone 😂😭
Heh... About that...
Imagine being the rat that gave all this information..feel sorry for that stressful rate.
I’ve been stressed from deployment until today (2012-2018) and can tell you you’ll get sick, your hair will fall out in patches(alopecia), and you’ll be unable to control emotional regulation. Don’t waste your time worrying about what you can’t change
If I'm not asleep or intoxicated, I hate it lmao
I am stressed every day.
“What if” 😂😂😂
This is not a question, this is a reality for me at this point
I wake up everyday too early. rekt
Bold of you to assume I'm not stressed everyday
Fapping helps to relieve stress.
in the background it's called anxiety disorder!
Love the podcast. #sidenote
There's this girl I know named Mary Jane, she's pretty good at de-stressing me

Don’t copy life noggin, or life noggin don’t copy you idk
Having pre-existing depression and anxiety plus chronic stress is terrible. I dream of the day when I have nothing to worry about. Just one day is all I want.
Can you watch the podcasts without having an apple device?
Can you watch the podcasts without having an apple device?
I want them to be my Science Teachers
well this made me stressed about being stressed
This video got me stressed
Well I'm screwed
Glad to know what’s going on in my body :3
So that's why I'm sick often and my memory gets worse and worse. I've had stress since I started middle school. It's now 7 years of chronic non-stop stress. One thing to note is that cortisol production ultimately decreases when stress is prolonged for years.
Aahhaaaaa i see
Already am
those animations are actually hilarious...
But I’m stressed everyday
This video stressed me... alot.
Boy I'm stressed everyday
i've never been stressed, life is chill.

I actually just watched this Ted Talk called “Making Stress your Friend” and the speaker talks about how your outlook on stress can literally changed the affects of stress on your body. It’s super interesting and I would highly recommend. Especially to people who are constantly stressed, and may have been freaked out by this video
You guys think you are stressed???






I can’t beat minecraft 😔
Should have been titled: School system effects on your brain
Have you tried not being stressed? 
And at some point... You loose feelings... After about 2 years.... You lose you will to live and you just wish for it to stop...

The story of my gf's life
I'm so going to die from chronic stress!
Time to throw my dreams of being a financially successful man, with a family of 4 kids out the video.

I’ll replace my list of things to do with:



I’m currently 13, I might not even get a driving license. Wish me luck with life, quite 
Honey please, I'm always stressed..
Guys come on. *Every day. It's two words. "Everyday" is an adjective which describes something (a noun) that is daily or normally routine.

Ex: Every day I go to school. (Here "every" is the adjective (could also say each) that is describing "day.")

Ex.: My everyday activities include school, soccer, and hobbies. (Here "everyday" is the adjective describing "activities.")

it's a Jake Paul level mistake like his song "It's Everyday Bro." Ironically, it literally means he is an everyday (meaning average, nothing special, daily thing) bro. Lol. I expect better from you guys!
N O   M O R E   S T O N E D   S C I E N C E !
Whelp, time to think about what's happening to me.
No joke I’m stressed every day and the six months I’ve already noticed

What If You Are Depressed Everyday?
Try working at a car dealership. It will kill you because of stress...
NICE VIDEO. 
Never go to YT Rewind again, that video was so bad.
This video stressed me out
This video stressed me out
I am never stressed
I stressed watching this video
Did you mean: Generalized Anxiety Disorder?
Hears that stress can cause cancer then immediately gets stressed
Welcome to my life....
I've been stressed everyday for the past five or so years. I didn't realize this until I was given anti-anxiety medication a few months ago, and missed a dose, and suddenly knew how bad it actually felt. Like being in a room with a lit candle for too long, or too much cologne.
Im stressed everyday 😩
I get stressed every single day at school, to the point that by the time the day is over I have induced myself into having a fever.
This is stressing
AT LAST STRESS PREVAILS MUHAHAHAHAHA
As someone who has bad social anxiety there's really no time when I'm not stressed out to some extent. The only thing that helps, albeit temporarily, is meditation.
What if???? LOL
My life everyday
This stressed me out
Stress > anxiety > depression > life  ruined.
I’ve been told being stress is healthy but not stress all the time.
I’m always stressed so there’s nothing you can do
Just sleep it off
Ahahaha I get stressed every day
That is me dude
Oh, you mean my life?
The real question is what if there is no stress at all? Would you lose all motivation like if you lose all our dopamine?
GG boys
after living with it for 20 years i find it hard to live without it ...
this video stressed me out
Can you guys make a video on how anti-depressants work and affects the brain ?
The most stressor is a broke college student. Haven't had a job for two months and I've been stressing everyday because I am broke and cannot help with finances. I've been applying every day and I have gotten rejected plus most of the people I've applied to, haven't reached out to me for an interview (I guess I didn't meet the requirements). It just kinda of sucks. And school isn't making it any better.
This made me stress
There is nothing that can be done about stress save changing society.
Yeah... "what if"
I was once hit on by a guy at a bar, that tried to tell me the humans were only born with a certain amount of , and using that cortisol is what ages you. So people age only because they stress out about things. Implying that if I stressed out too much (this included the stress of lifting weights as a women) I would use up all my cortisol and aged rapidly.

 He didn't mean I would just look a little older, he meant I would look 80 in my twenties because I used all my cortisol and age myself... strange man.
I think you could make a great video on recognising voices - you could play a game of “Gregg or Mitch” where listeners who don’t know you personally hear but don’t see you and guess who is speaking. I guess it might vary with listeners country of origin - your voices often sound the same to my British ear!
One word:Exams
Welcome to my life
I’ve been stressed 97% of the time for the past 4 months. The semester ends in like a week and I’ll finally be able to breath before starting all over again in January.

I can't watch this rn because I'm in bed next to my sleeping partner. But heck, I have an anxiety disorder. I stress all the time, even in my sleep. One of the things I stress about is whether my constant stress levels will kill me. So thanks for this video and the panic attack I'll be having when actually watching this!!! (the comments alone already give me anxiety)
*every day
I stress a lot
So you're telling me that there are people that are not stressed everyday?

[Edit: Enlarged heart, is the LEAST bad of the side effects of "chronic acute stress" -- I may just hit my mum's record and die at 45 of a stroke and/or heartattack while standing; she died of stubbornness with a healthy side of stress despite a healthy diet, size, and routine physical exercise.]
Can you do a video on endometriosis!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe stressing us out is a conspiracy to counter overpopulation
I’m already stressed out watching this
Wait... There are people who don't get at least half a minute of stress a day?! How come?
A fap per day takes the stress away
I have ALS and it's been a pretty steady decline since 2011. That is until I took a REALLY stressful job for a year. My symptoms and decline sped up so fast it was unreal. Getting out of that position put me back on the slow pace I'd been on before. That job was awful... So glad I'm not doing it anymore. However, I deeply miss a lot of the people I met in that job. We really supported one another.
But i am stressed every day... Am i gonna die?
1:52 is what happens for every student. School. It’s stressful, and we certainly can’t avoid it unless we want to be unsuccessful in our adult lives (according to school).
Why stress? Over what exactly are you stressing about? Don't fear anything and you'll learn how to not stress. How can we fear nothing? That takes alot of letting go and allowing the universe to control everything for you. "Just go with the flow".
My stressors aren't externally based. It's internally based. I can actually handle life problems. However I suffer from something called toxic shame and have a very negative self concept. I'm on the process of curing it, though.
this video is stressing me out.
Guess I’m gonna die young, then...
Omg  what did they do to those mice
How do you make a rat stressed?
Now I’m stressed about being stressed smh
If anyone is stressed everyday, i have the best recommendation for you. Just meditate 5-10 min everyday before you start your day.   Trust me it can change your life forever. You become more focus, less stress, less depress, lowers anxiety aswell. There is great app on the play store or app store called " headspace". It probably on of my favourite meditation app. Just try it for one day, if you feel nothing then delete the app. Mediation changed my life forever, i think it can help you guys aswell. Asap science has a great video on mediation, you guys should check it out. Peace and love guys
I really hope I die sooner
Is it normal that sometimes I want to end it all but at same time I don't wanna?

What I would like to know: Is there scientific evidence to back up the internet’s claims about the benefits of cold showers? I’ve been taking them for a week now and have noticed benefits, but is there a real scientific reason for the cold water to help with increased energy and skin/hair health or is it just a placebo effect?
Super helpful video!
I have a weird idea for a video. Something make-up-y like a melting lipsticks and how they mix. Idk random
I have anxiety. Help.

Is anyone else wondering how these scientists stressed out the rats?
Your videos are soooooooooo good i love you
So you're saying it's bad to be stressed everyday? Okay great, thanks anyway.

Pls make a video about coma
Anyone else felt stressed when watching the video, just because it was talking about stress?
I’m getting stressed watching this because I know I’m way too stressed
I have a question. How do u make a rat stressed?
When you have a anxiety disorder.....
Oh dats me all day
I used to be an investment banker and I have been a victim of chronic stress.
I was stressed out for about 2 years (almost everyday). I developed panic attacks that affects me everyday. Long term, stressing out everyday is NOT worth it. Gotta think LONG-TERM. Masturbate if you have to (AsapSCIENCE APPROVES IT). 😘😉
When you have Addison’s disease and your body cannot be stressed because your body doesn’t make cortisol
god: then perish
When u have an anxiety disorder yeet
Yes.
What do you mean "if"
We think we are stressed today but people nowadays don’t have it that bad in most parts of the world. In the past people had the stress or getting sick and dying young, having multiple offspring die, having enough to eat, and if we’re going even further in time we were stressed every day because we had to hunt and try not to fall prey to predators.
What if you’re depressed everyday ez video
Welcome to my life as a 13 year old
tell this to teachers
Cortisol ❤️🧠
Well I'm gonna die
That was awesome thanks
Love me a good ol’ science video.
People are going to be stressed for the majority of their lifetime. Going to school for about your first 20 years of life  = stressed. Then going to work for another 40 years = stressed. When you have your own family and bills to pay = more stressed. You are basically going to be stressed until you are dead. We can minimize the stress, but to say get rid of it completely is probably very unlikely to happen because certain things in life is out of our control.
Where can I find that merch?

Now how tf did they manage to make a rat stress out?
I have been extremely stressed for the past 3 months... with the last month being worse than boiling in hell.
Ok and how did they keep these mice stressed for months dog? Exams on cheesiology or sth ?
You know...you didn't do your research here. YOu skipped the studies that found stress is only detrimental because humans believe it to be detrimental. So ur video is literally just habituating the idea that it's harmful....which is making it harmful. If you view stress as simply a challenge to be overcome and not as dangerous to your health you won't suffer any detrimental effects from it. You can look that up on your own. If you wanted to make a video that harms people physically...then good job? Congratz on shortening a few hundred thousand peoples lifespans I guess. Thankfully I won't be one of them cause I do my research. Rekt
Sore u in youtube rewind
Im 20 years old but my mental health isnt any better. In fact, its worsening since i got into university and being stressed daily. I got stress or anxiety attacks almost everyday. Whenever i hear something that will stresses me, my reaction immediately goes into 'stress attack mode' whether or not the issue is truly stressful. But my mind goes into anxiety automatically. I guess years of stress already did took its toll on my brain. Whats worse is that i cant stop all this. It just came like that. And the damage it done(poor memory,slow learning process), really doesnt help with my barely surviving studies which in turn also cause me to stress. Its a vicious cycle.
Have a baby. Thats the source of stress.
Stay cool
I want to know how they stressed the rats out, did they have to do rat exams? I need answers!
Can you drink a powder
Go brain on nicotine
Now I’m stressed that I’m gonna get depression

Life is just a living nightmare. How to not stress out, do not think more than 12 hours in the future and accept your past abuse.

I have always thought my cancer was caused by stress.
The intergenerational impact of the stress of slavery, segregation, and racism helps to explain the significant difference in life expectancy between blacks and whites.  The question is what can be done to undo the impact on long-term chronic racialized stress.'
Have you been an enfp
God damn it.
Is this why as the years go by I start twitching more and having more frequent auditory and visiual hallucinations all while going without sleep a couple nights a week and then crashing and sleeping until like 6pm on days off
How did they make the rats stressed out?
Anybody else get weird muscle spasms when they are stressed? It stresses me out more lmao
Chronic disease here, painful and the threatments don't really help much. like 10-15% of people with my disease end up killing themself and about 80% suffer either anxiety or depression (hello i'm here). 
I don't even get any official national recognition (since my problem isn't popular), at least not until my condition will get worse with the years and I'll be de facto disabled. Yaaay
Smoke some weed
How did they make the rats stressed?! That’s what I wanna know!
Its called school
Yes.
Rewind was a mistake
So, no school?
Its called depression.
Lol every highschooler ever
You mean school?
100% rght
Being stressed everyday is the absolute worst and I would not wish it upon anyone (even my greatest enemy). Seriously, seek immediate help if you are experiencing chronic stress; it’s possible to fully recover
What’s the difference between stress and nervousness or anxiety?
Yes
laughs in general anxiety disorder
First
What if you don't take very many breaks? (Like your forcing yourself not to take a break) And your contantly moving and less relaxing?
This was in my mentions and all I kept thinking to my self before scrolling past it 3 times was how this is reality to me to stress every day and this channel is making it seem like it is so foreign
Redundant video
@anxiety
Why were the rats stressed for 6 months? Receeding hairline maybe
So college is killing me?
Autism makes you stressed everyday as I have autism and I stressed everyday
Well I guess college will kill me then
Me irl
So why university insist ?    They want to silently kill young people with stress.
So constant stress is bad for our memory? In that case, school really does make you dumber.
That’s so right !!!
So basically what you're saying is.....im going to die
Can this please be sent to all schools and universities?
Guess imma die then
If you are stressed just know that in one year things will be ten times worse.
Why u copying life nogging
What happens after 20 years of stress?

Who else loves this music?
Good luck to me :)
They should study high schoolers
Get rid of GSCE's then plez
my brain can't handle this
You mean pretty much my whole life up to about 6 months ago?
Damn I’m stressed on the daily but to tired to raise my heart rate, since I’m pulling 3-4 all nighters a week. Taking multiple science courses at the same time while needing straight a’s to enter the program, was not a good idea. Not to even mention life responsibility making money to survive for yourself. The struggles of being born poor and not smart lol, work 10 times harder to be at the same spot others get effortlessly.
So scientists stressed out some rats every day for 6 months? Lol poor lil guys
how did they stress out a rat tho
How did they stress rats
Wait it's not normal.
I don’t get it why can’t you just unstressed
If you’re stressed all the time? I eat, breathe, and sleep stressed.
I am. It's draining and sucks and there's no quick fix for it. It's called being an adult and working middle class.
School
Nice finna die soon 👌👌
What happens if you bought csgo?
guess im gonna die young then......
Hi
What happens if you’re never stressed?
I wouldn’t say I’m “stressed” to the point where my heart is racing and my breathing increases, I’m just chilling in bed while the entire world around me is on fire. Like the “this is fine” dog, but I know, I know damn well, that this, in fact, is not fine.
shrug
guess I'll die
1:56 wait depression is a disease?
Wow, can’t wait for that early death.
Impeach the Dotard. Case close.
The bills would have to pay themselves... Only then would I start being less stressed.
I’m always stressed cus I never get enough sleep and then I get stressed getting ready for school and then when I’m at school I’m stressing about my grades then I go home and stress about how I’m having a bad day because I’ve been stressing the whole day and then I stress about trying to go to sleep and the cycle repeats
Based on the top comments, we are all doomed
Wow you guys were in YouTube Rewind
OMG!
Isn’t that normal?

Can you guys make a song about all 206 bones or about muscles (wich there are about 600 of them)?
Why do humans use rats for so many studies .... are we like related ?
You eat desserts
I can answer this one!!! You end up slumped over at the dinner table, paralyzed, with your heart racing, chest burning, feeling mostly numb, double vision, and get carted off to the E.R. for the night, because your body forcefully shut you down due to stress. XD Happened to me for the first time earlier this week. They said I'm healthy as an ox, but under too much stress to the point of traumatizing my poor body.
How on earth do you stress a rat for 6 months straight?
Real talk tho stress is one of the worst things you can put your body through. Try your hardest not to “stress out”
B*tch I’m always anxious/stressed.
Well
How about 15 years of stress
too late
Not what if... Why
1:40 Who felt sad for that rat :(
Isn’t it a coincidence that Life Noggin made a video about stress in the same day?
I wonder what slaughterhouse workers go through every day. There's a human cost to factory farming too.
I have been stressed for yrs now ..... i am fine .... i guess ?
I work at the airport. And it stresses me out when people don’t take their god damn elections out of their bags. Only if ppl could listen to my advisements

There's this girl I met at work everytime I see her it's like a luck charm. Let's go back a little. When I dont see her, I make at least 1 mistake when I drive. Everytime I see her I dont make a single mistake when I drive to or from home. She looks at me before I look at her. I see her from my peripheral vision looking at me with a smile on her face. She's a year under me.
😒
YA DIE!!!! SIMPILE
Dead.
The fact is...

That im stressed every DAMN day.
Thanks for letting me know my future
Now Im stressed about not being stressed
Lol I can say this is true, for I've been stressed for about 3 and a half years (with periods to relax myself, of course), but the more stressed I was, the least I could remember.
:)))))thanksschool
It’s everyday bro with that cortisol flow
I predicted before watching that 95% of comments would be "I already am" and I was right
honestly can't believe that you released this video literally the day after my stress project was due in psychology, how rude
Watching this during finals week 😂
Finally a video about me and my life
stressed about being stressed
Well no wonder I can’t concentrate for more than 5 minutes I’ve been stressed for the last 10 years! (Literally half my life)
wow, this explains why i am so dumb.
Lol my whole generation is stressed all the time
Yup, sounds about right
Thats my life in a video
My amygdala is much bigger than that.
What if. Lol
Mood
I’m watching this video but tbh I already know what happens, I’m living it
IITians : that’s cute .
"What if" they say. Lmaooo I live in NYC it's stressful to just exist in this city.
So you become angry and dumb..... pretty accurate description of my life.
Can you guys do a video on how dogs decrease stress, maximize happiness, and help with several other problems??
Ever heard of being in the military?
What if I am already stressed everyday
I like to smoke a joint when I am stressed!
Why am i watching i alr know how this feels
Interesting how Life Noggin made a video about this today and you "chose" the same topic on the same day. :thinking:
What do you mean 'what if'?
...soooooooo, should i just resign myself to this futurem
Did you mean exam weeks ?
My life in 2 minutes and 30 seconds
This was me for a month. It was horrible, diarrhea everyday, could constantly feel my heartbeat for the entire month, restlessness, slept once every 3-4 days, difficulty concentrating, had to really strain my self-control to not lash out at loved ones...
wait... so you’re not supposed to be stressed everyday?
... it's been over 4 years of this.
Wowzers.
What do you mean "What if"?
So... basically anyone with anxiety disorders experience this daily... You should really do a video on mental illness. its prevalence in the global population (roughly 18% of the population suffer from mental illness) and how it is viewed negatively, and should be discussed more openly to change the stigma. Simply talking about GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and depression openly can help people who suffer from it.
Lol stressed daily. I’m stressed every second of my life. College is fun (:
Wondering if anyone can answer this - if being stressed means releasing the cortisol hormone and thus, increased heart rate, blood pressure, etc. , the how does it, at the same time, cause depression? When severely depressed, one is no longer in the heightened state of antsiness/high heart rate.... those 2 responses to stress seem... idk... contradictory?
stress due to unfinished job causes anxiety. cant finish job because of anxiety. 

i feel so scammed by my own brain.
Life noggin made a video about stress as well!! Weird🌊
This just increased my stress level even more
Music is a big help 🎧
What if!?
Should be "why are you stressed everyday."
Drink? I actually get nervous at parties if I am drunk.
Smoke weed?... Basically a fun stress.
Let me save you guys time yes someone already thought of the perfect comment
Life noggin and you lol
Hmm, right after Life Noggin's video cool
what do you mean “what if”?
Before I even start this I am stressed everyday? So I should know the answer?

Life Noggin posted a similar video 4 hours ago. Just sayin' I found that weird.
I swear LFN just Uploaded something like this
Y’all’s timing is PERFECT
does stress have anything to do with hair loss as well? I'm in college trying to desperately get into my desired major and failing at it as well. I'm breathing heavily just by walking 10 minutes to class with only a laptop in my backpack and the rate of my hair loss had increased to the level where running my finger through them, I can pull out 2 or 3 strands. My sleep and eating habits are still normal and I'm happy with the amount I sleep and eat but I'm always finding myself gasping for air after one flight of stairs.
This video made me so stressed
what if that is already me?
#college
Gwoon meer jonko

Thanks ASAPscience..
Good thing I'm not. 👍
Uhmmm generalized anxiety disorder ? 💁🏻‍♀️
hitting the gym for sure temporarily decreases stress for me, but one session of magic mushrooms and any ounce of stress is non-existent for the following couple of months. It's the ultimate remedy, in my opinion. Don't knock it till you try it
Stress is a part of my personality
Graduate Students have left the chat
I'm stressed everyday☠
Only problem is if a stressed person sees this they'll just become more stressed.
Every channel is making videos about cronic stress
Now im even more stressed
Buying a house has been the most stressful situation in my life. Felt like a crazy person liking the house 1 minute and hating it the next.
What would happen if you ate too many breath mints

I always wonder which degrees are harder/stressful. I think engineers/medical degrees would be the most stressful/hardest degrees to go through. Any opinions?
Not meant to be stressed, well I wish I could say I am stress free everyday :-( 
Yea that would be really nice :-)
Thank You Gents for another informative video!!
Yeah , I know and im stress everyday 😂

Anxiety sufferer here...yes.

Poor Elon musk
Could you guys try and take a look at the both short and long term effects of the whole world going vegetarian or vegan. The is currently in Denmark a lot of media focus on extremist vegans and children/infants not doing well because of a vegan diet. But they say a vegetarian or vegan diet would help the water shortage but what about in the long run?
You would kill you’reself or go have a burnout
whoops
Thanks for making a video about me
There's no "what if". I am stressed every day lol
I have sleep anxiety....i am stressed all the time especially nights  cause i have uni in the morning 😭😭😭😭😭

Numma one cause of stress - uploading the same video as Life Noggin on the same day
I’m so stressed that when I’m forced to just lay down and not move  example during a facial , my heart beat beats so fast and I hold my breath 😫 I can’t relax I’m so tense all the time . 🥺
I have never been stressed...
Idk what being stressed is like....
Or have i been stressed? It is just not so bad as i thought?
Well it looks like I’ve been stressed for months *shrugs*
How am i meant to stop stress when i have school?!
This video came just in time
[Sweating violently]
What can you do to mitigate stress? Nothing. We're expected to be stressed every day, by design. Our culture is career obsessed, and there just aren't good jobs. Not for the 99% at least. Life is shit wall to wall, and our species is only going to continue to suffer from constant stress in this social climate.

Cirrhosis of the liver is absolutely correct! When we have a high-fat high-salt diet it feeds viruses and dehydrates us chronically. I've learned so much about this from medical medium Anthony William
In England, ‘chips’ are fries 🍟 and our crisps are America’s chips 🍟

British translation.

Chips=Crisps
Lays is also known for its destroying power of dreams and scamege hahahahaha😂😂😂
What about corn chips?
Fries/chips arent high in salt. They taste salty because the salt is on the outside. Foods like pizza, soup, even bread are far higher because the salt is spread throughout

@LaysChips care to comment :P
I don't understand why chips don't have Surgeon warnings the same way tobacco products do; they both have cancer causing chemicals, although chips have it on a much smaller scale. FDA what the hell?

Okay but technically speaking would these be that bad?
2 things to say about the comments here..

Why so many comments saying "no its crisps", "no its chips" liKe either one is correct, depending on where you live, you may call it something different.

Also why is everyone commenting guesses about what'll happen.? That's  what the video is about, commenting that is pointless, ya'll.

Just watch the video.
i mean at least theres a good side
now we're asking the right questions
Is this making anyone want chips
Nope, lays are famous for the air it sell in the package, not chips.
You should do “What if you only ate HOT chips?”
it’s sodium chloride
Turning 20 on dec 10 and this is horrifying me lmaoo

I was eating crisps while watching this .-.

Not joking, as i lay in bed getting ready to go to sleep i have with me one Cooled bottle of sodawater (1.25L) and go through about one pack of chips, not the snack ones, the share ones. not the GIGANTIC ones just the bigger than snack ones. Have been doing this for about 5 years or so with nights occasionally where I don't. I regularly engage in exersize and play basketball. I'll be dead at 50 for sure! hahaha
We call them crisps in the UK.
shoutout to my boy nasty neckface
What exactly is it that makes chips so addictive? Is it because its just perfect?
The real question is where did you get a bag off chips for a dollar!!!
* eats chips while watching video *
wow thanks for this.
Lay’s are Walkers crisps right?
How am I not dead?
Chips are my addiction,I would crush them up and snort them if I could.
well it's a bit late now, I've basically had a meal deal everyday for lunch at work, sandwich + drink + bag of crisps for many many many years now x.x
Next time I have some crisps I might think twice

Heart has left the chat

It's crisps though
High thought of the day.
I'm scared I don't eat enough good food. Ima get sick!!!!!!!!
this is very unscientific and biased. Eg it's unclear why people died who ate chips. Maybe they also smoked more often. Concluding chips should not be the main diet because someone developed autoimmune hepatitis is equally misleading. Moreover it's implicated soecifically lack of omega3 is a problem with a fries diet leading to more inflammation. While that's true, it's weird to mention exactly this fatty acid- if so many other things are lacking. Event the comparison with lack of vitamins etc nonsensical because that would almost apply to every edible food. What makes chips different from overeating X, would make actual sense. Just clickbait...
I used to eat only chips, so I need to know
Now we all know why God 707 wears glasses

Chips are like cigarettes, even a video about how terrible they are for you makes you want them.
damn...i once at a family sized bag of chips in one sitting...and just 3 small bags raise your levels of that neurotoxin / carcinogen that  much...welp i guess its good i excercise and eat relatively healthy. time to eat some more chips and watch another vid.

I’m British and they’re called crisps and I think that’s a stupid name they should be called chips and what we call chips should just be called fries like if u agree :3

Hilarious that the #1 meal/ side dish at my school is fries. They are the cheapest thing they sell. Even cheaper than a bottle of water.
Eat chips as much as you want guys, but at the same time maintain a diet with all the nutrition you need
So never leave the house
Now you tell me...
Stop roasting me dammit
SHUT UP NOOB! WATCH THIS grabs 5 packs of chips and shoves it all in mouth HAHA SUCKA dies

Of course this video pops up on my recommended as soon as i open a bag of chips
I'm less worried about eating too many chips and more shook over the fact that the 20-year-old developed cirrhosis and died from autoimmune hepatitis from a heavy French fry diet. 
I'm ditching fries with my fast food meals now.
Are we not gonna talk about osteoporosis
I'm eating French fries right now
This video is definitely over estimating the harm of Acrylamide and put some nonsense logic inside. First, humans usually won't be able to expose to that large amount of acrylamide (both acute and chronic doses are not reached). Second, the cause of autoimmune hepatitis is NOT KNOWN so you can't say it's related to something AT ALL! This video is just spreading totally nonsense panic to everyone!
The most serious problem with potato chips is high amount of oil and salt. These two things can cause CVDs and diabet.
No shade tho
Accend to godhood
Awww shoot this is all I eat !!!
That’s me tho
I have osteoporosis
Store bought frozen fries okay?
I’m here for a good time not a long time

What about chocolate chips😯
Does Doctor Pepper brand Zoda have a chemical that increases a person's intelligence. "I mean... there's no way caffeine... from this drink.....is stronger to me.... than xience drink's....                   "
Now that's a nice way of commiting suicide
If you drink a lot of water, eat chips and work out, I'm pretty sure you could eat only that for a whole month with little ill effect.
I don’t know why Americans call them chips they’re crisps
After seeing the video where you guys said that you could be healthy eating only meat i just cant take any videos about diet from you seriously
I'll stop eating food now.

Plz explain why Americans call walkers lays
Tell this to the girl on freaky eaters.
umm think McDonald's would disagree... Good luck with that. I mean isn't the the chemical not the vehicle that's bad? What's the alternative? I like science not sensationalism. I like solutions. Bring something else to the table. Cause it looks like we all brought chips😐
Ahhhhhhh no am not eating chips
No thx
I HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS
As a member of the potato community, I feel slightly threatened by this video.
i ve already been doing that and i didnt get fat
Lmao and people thing vaping is bad. Literally everything causes cancer or some other major health problem.
I don't like chips.
The quarter of a bag scale you showed was wrong, since as we all know a lays bag of chips is 90% air (in reality it’s 60% nitrogen)
If you only ate lays then you would have enough oxygen to survive in the moon, it's scientifically proven.
pretty much you'd die
Anyone else was thinking about 707 from Mystic Messenger the whole video? No? Just me?

when i was like 7-9 there was a solid couple months where i was violently depressed (yes childhood depression is a thing) and so i would only eat chips, but like maybe 5 of those 150 cal bags a day. it literally messed me up so bad that i was put on this special medicine to help me absorb nutrients better because they barely any nutritional value when they’re the only thing you eat. it s u c k e d
Just started this diet! seeing results allready!
What are lays
Can I still eat poutine
Only 6 bags a day?
Is fast food chips (from McDonalds and such) different than homemade ones? I eat a lot of chips but 80% of the time it's homemade
I HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS
Wtf. Who the hell eats lays classic chips. Y’all need some flavour in your lives....
They are also worse for your teeth than eating sugary candy.
The little bits that get stuck in your gums begin to break down into carbohydrates from your saliva and they just stays there until you pick it out or floss.
hahhahAhhHahahHahaHahHaahH OSTEOPOROSIS
i want to eat doritos
Chisp
Too late.
does anyone else think baked lays taste better than fried lays? and this isn’t coming from a very healthy person, i USUALLY enjoy the greasier option but baked lays- the ones you get from subway- that’s where it’s at
Damn
Then you’ll turn into me
I would be happy
I already know what would happen, you would just cut your lips a lot.
Oops
Diabetes type 3
can you stop I haven’t ate in 3 weeks
Are goldfish ok?
this really makes want to say "I'm here for a good time, not a long time" but that last little bit really did spook me because I eat fried potatoes often 😅
Classic lays is gross thoo
Worth it
I have to eat chips at least 1 bag a day or else I get anxiety. 2 so I could be pleased. One day I didnt eat a bag and I was crying and sad and I was so mad. But I also eat healthy. I'm not fat tho and I workout. I went to the emergency room one time because I ate 9 bags of chips(in like 5 hours) and i couldn't breath Dont judge me.Im 14 atm and lately I been eating only healthy vegan stuff and a bag of chips everyday because i dont wanna die of chips so i eat healthy too.
OSTEOPOROSIS
I’m literally eating Lays rn
Why do those potatoes look like they just stepped out of VeggieTales?
I’m draining the supplie of potatoes in this world
I'm pretty sure even half a bag of chips would give me diarrhea lol.
K what was the last time I ate a full bag of chip.................oh ya like 2 month ago and 1 little chip like a week ago
Can you imagine how constipated all those chips would make you? You probably wouldn’t be able to shit for a week.
Cheetos flamit hot ftw
That blind potato tho

Walkers
I just eat McDonalds French fries once a day

Sooo we still have Cancer and we know the reason why and yet they still ask me to donate. Fk that no more donations. Sorry St Jude’s but you are part of the problem. 😡
Omg chaaaappppppssssssss
Please do the science of fats
They are NOT addictive. They are no different than any other tasty food. They also don’t inherently have trans fats. Most makers no longer use trans in their products and you can make them at home without it.
I want a tattoo of the potato grim reaper
i’m eating chips right now
If you eat under 2000 calories a day you’ll stay skinny
Does anyone know how to stop a potato, corn and veggie chips? I can’t stop eating them everyday
Even if I wanted to only eat chips I can't. I physically can not eat more than like, one bag of lays. After that, chips just become repulsive and disgusting to my body; If I had to follow this philosophy, I wouldn't be able to. I would get so sick of chips that I'd rather starve.
The top of your mouth will bleed
This explains why I'm so stupid
No need for a video: You would get fat
So we would die sooner AND we won't get scurvy? Best advertising ever tbh
I don’t even eat chips! Not kidding :/
You would just die
WTF how in hell am I still alive??
Lmao I don’t like potato chips. People think I’m not even human
Let me save you 3 minutes.... You die.
Can you make a video on what happens if you ate ice cream everyday? Please my friend says his sister eats ice cream everyday because it's healthy.
My aunt is addicted to chips, it’s sad but I don’t know what to do about it. She eats a large bag a day...
Lol. I used to live off chips. I could eat a family sized bag back in the day, almost daily. The next day, my hunger levels would be minimal. I would go several months on chips, then switch to something like lucky charms for several months, then spaghetti with no meat for several months. As an adult I have a very small menu, but it does consist of a balance of a few fruits and veggies a day with poultry or eggs. I sometimes go back to eating chips daily, but no more than a week. Lol, I try to stay away from foods that are such an unhealthy trigger.
I’ve always kind of hated potato chips, I rarely eat them because just one bag makes me feel all gross inside.
Funny, I’m eating chips rn
That is sooooo me. I'm gonna die early
I have never been so motivated to better my eating habits
Dafuq!! 😧

Mice aren't good test animals for humans
Some where I read you can survive on potatoes and butter. I do not know the quantities.
If you only ate chips then you wouldnt get the right nutrients for your body and youd probably die from eating junk food
Me: Eating chips sees a video about what happens if you at chips all the time
Me: um... yummy XD
Me: ..
I wonder why all the tasty things in this world are always harmful😢
These are the questions I stay up all night thinking about
So what if they’re Lays “Baked” chips? 🙄
I normally but don't eat chips or fries these days just because of the calories and salt. But so delicious.

This video was stupid. I mean it’s pretty obvious that you shouldn’t eat a lot of anything and you should keep what food you it a good mix.
In short, don't eat just chips everyday 😂😂
WHAT HAPPENS IF U ONLY LOOK AT MEMEs
Yesterday I ate a whole bag of party sized lays chips. Oops, but at least I don't gain weight fast 😂😂😂
The latest lab Rottweilers show us that we prefer raw live chickens over kibble.
Why did you have to ruin chips for me?
Yall got me so scared having me thinking all cooked starchy foods have cancer causing Acrylamide! I looked it up but it seems that whole foods are still healthy even if they have Acrylamide. Due to that whole grains have health benefits along with if you are eating cancer fighting foods like high antioxidant berries, vegetables and fruits. Like a vegan ✌🏻🌱 like me 💁🏻‍♂️
In Ireland we call crisps tayto
I was literally eating chips while I clicked Home and saw this video.
Can you do "what if you only ate pizza" cuz I know a lot of people who do
1:30 he said "or a handful" because that's literally how much chips you get from lays
watching for a friend
I only eat chilli Doritos
Beag of chips
Why are they calling chaps chips?
go out doin what you love most
Obese..
What happens if they do a surgery on a grape
Ate Chips
Doritos are still better
I would say my diet for the past three days has been 50% chocolate
I literally just had a bag of crisps
Who else was wasting chips when watching this 😂🤷🏻‍♀️?
Acrylamide is also in most fast foods, including taco bell.
Eating that much also increases chances for acne 
Source: me
I dont eat em coz I'm broke n they don't full my belly enough, where that crew at?
707 be like. 😂
I seriously eat chips like 2 times everyday.......🙄
Crisps/Chips
What do you mean "what if"?
Who else eating chips right now
So this happened. I was scrolling through my homepage on YouTube while watching this video while it was on "Drag mode" as I can recall, then a video of A woman only eating chips everyday popped up. Man that was so Ironic 😂😂😂 (Like if you agree)
hmm chips give you hepatitis
Is it the same for home made french fries؟
What happens if you only eat chicken
So we can’t eat chips Mann ion care ima eat chips everyday if I want and French fries
What about frying your own potatoes and making your own crisps?
I hear a lot about the addictive and harmful nature of sugar, but I don’t hear about chips that often. I mean, I know they’re bad for you. Everyone knows they’re bad for you. But this really puts it into perspective just how bad they can be. Three handfuls of chips a day really isn’t a high bar to get over, especially for salty snack lovers like me.
I’m watching this while eating chips
This reminds me of that video on Freaky Eaters. That girl that was addicted to potatoes.
How about an episode of an chocolate only diet
*Eats stones* 
"What if we hit a blunt?"
*hits blunt

“Wait, what if we do Stone Science. Where we get stoned, and then just talk about stones?”
This is where this channel is going
Come on guys this isnt what the channel is about... Post "comedy" stuff on your other channel
This is like when your friend tells you to kinda change the answers you're copying off them with the answers being drunk history
Im a stoner but why has this channel become so smoking related?
The audio quality is almost unbearable
But.... why? Why can't this be on another channel?
This channel's content is really trying to relate to youth....
this..this is bad......
I don't understand this channels obsession with marijuana. I do have not much against it, I consume some occasionally myself, but I thought this is supposed to be a general science focused channel.
The only thing funny about this is the fact they said these people were 'comedians'
The Munchies System
i cant explain digestion when im sober 😂
Yo why is the food bladder called a stomach?
No ASAP Science. Please don't try to become someone else. You were the best the way you were when you were not stoned.
When you realize these videos are slowly dropping in quality: 2:17
You'd think with all the dislikes they'd get the point
I learned this from Magic School Bus 🚌 years ago
Really scraping the bottom of the barrel now!
This is not the fagulous science i signed up for.
Is this asapscience?, Maybe it is but this doesnt seem like it belongs here, hope it's a 1 time thing.
I get it. You're trying to do your own version of drunk history.... but it's not funny.
The volume is lowkey trash
'comedian'
Hahahaha get it cause pot is funny.
3:19 The Force is strong with this one
Just got PTSD from seeing the Don’t hug me Im scared clip
Sound quality sucks in this One... :X
This really doesn't need to be a thing
Love it!!!! 
Nuclear fusion!
I am sorry but this is really scrapping the bottom of barrel now!
*hits blunt
I enjoy these. Its funny and interesting ♥️ the graphics and edits had my dying 🤣😂
I hope you guys from ASAP Science are reading the comments on this video. Your viewers are practically one-sided about sticking to this content or not
This... Is not looking good... This feels like a complete disconnect from the channel.  The only thing that makes it recognizable is the very little bit of animation of the same style i know this channel for. As a fan. I hated this video. Like... This felt like it came from a channel that only has editting tricks to use to try make it somewhat interesting.
DHIMS can't wait for the new season🤗💖
I don't know if this video was informative or not. But the sound of this video is shitty... that's the technical thing that made me stopped watching this video right after the intro...
*sees thumbnail in recommended*
Oh no, not again...
pls post smart things
Bro honestly I love this series
Love the video but next time use a different mic 🎙
This is better than drunk history. Subbed.
❤...lmao...on point👌🏾...how about Stoned Science do an episode on why people cry🤷🏾‍♀️
I've smoked pot most of my life. I'm stoned now - and I think this video/concept is corny AF
Can you do old type of videos please?
This channel is done for...
i’m an everyday weed smoker and i still find this series incredibly cringey
Sad to see this channel dying but well whatever
BTICH I LOST IT AT 3:01 OMFG 😂😂😂😂 WHY IT LOOK LIKE THAT
wtf happened to this channel?
Hahaha!! Yes girl they were trying to drown you! 
😂🤣😂👻🌊
OMG, do you see people interviewing drunk people talking about historic moments in time..... ?

oh wait... nevermind
Thought this channel was for kids.
Guess the kid's show art style is actually just for marxists.
Love this!! Please do more! Lol
Munch-munch-gulp!

That's what she said!
Dear AsapSCIENCE 


Can you explain why when we scratch our skin it turns white?
PLZ ANSWER
P.S LOVE YOUR VIDs
ppl who disliking have never smoke a joint in there life
I actually enjoyed this and your channel always
Keep Going ❤️
Editing more A1 than my grandpaws A1 Steak Sauce
Great lol. Please explain how the kidneys work for these n00bs.
*hits blunt
Again love the concept and love the show so far but I’d love to see the person actually smoking or getting high keep up the fantastic work I love this girl she’s great 😄🤙🏼
Why so many dislikes? We have a lot of kids here I guess 🤷🏽‍♀️
Omg this is hilarious XD more please! <3
how am I here wtf
Yes. The quality content we all signed up for
Pardon me if this already exists without me knowing it, but they should do this with actual scientists who are willing to get drunk or stoned.
that was awesome, do more!
Welp time to unsub. Had a good run at least
Loved this one! Looking forward to the next!
This was awesome!! Keep it up you guys!! 💕🎉
What is the plural form of 'villain'? Answer: Villi
Funny idea, but wrong place to have the video, start a different channel for it, disliked for that reason.

Interesting vid but Audio was really really bad.
idk if i can stay subscribed after th is one
* hits blunt * 
What if people could shush?
Explain how batteries work.
Hell yeah, let's get stoned 🤑🧟‍♂️
LOVE THIS VIDS
!!!
Haters complaining but they just need to hit a blunt and watch. Sit down...
.... but why are there so many dislikes? Tf
Stop with the drug promotion
Why Asap why?? Who would actually enjoy this content? Is your key demographic nerdy stoners or something? Because this was just terrible. It's like watching a drugged up student be forced to read science facts in detention, which no one enjoys. Oh and the editing  Y  I  K  E  S
*smokes a stone*
"Am I high?"
I don't like the fact that you are making a drug mainstream. I know that it's not more harmful than tobacco or alcohol, but you aren't promoting them either! Marijuana is just one more drug that will negatively impact our society, as  do all other dangerous substanses! Also legalising is not the same as making something mainstream. Marrying you cousins is legal, but not anything we as a society accept nor promote.

So please keep this channel on science and don't make it political!
loooove this series and concept and the sharing of knowledge (thank you!!!) but not the biggest fan of the angle and audio quality
Yea if stoned people did science 
Thats where humanity ends 
#eloncomefast
I LOVED IT!! Please, bring some science experiences
Almost as good as drunk history
Don't listen to them dudes; keep doing this but don't forget about the "proper" science content.
An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.
This was very educational while also being super hilarious! Kept it interesting! Nice job ASAPSCIENCE. like button!
Best series 🤣🤣🤣
Are you guys okay? You’ve been kind of promoting weed a lot.
Greetings from Germany. I don't have to write more;) 




Okay, maybe not. I like the new content. Please make a few more!
Guys really you have a good idea but you are doing it all wrong. This isnt about the weed, this is just so cringey and poorly made.
This was actually very accurate. 👍🏼 Just finished reading the digestive system chapter in my anatomy book.
Do the immune system. It’s crazy lol
only going down hill from here haha see you at the bottom asapscience 😂
hits blunt

me: what if i digested stones
Ohhh you guys are Canadian! You've just been waiting for the 17th for this huh? Lol
20 seconds in and I'm already wheezing from laughter
This series is insulting to everyone involved.
This is perfect. I want more.
Not the best audio quality, sorry :/ Love you guys tho
Expanding my mind comically 😆❤
The Sound quality is atrocious
Y'all explained it better than my biology teacher from middle school
* hits blunt *
Saliva is just food lube
Great way to dismantle your credibility...

It's not even funny
when they played the dhmis scene...lmao
Explain how a certain surgery works
this was so high quality great work keep em like this
This isn't the right channel. Kids are subscribed to this ffs...
I honestly think this segment is amazing/hilarious and I love how various your videos are!!!! I don't think people understand that there is a science to everything and it can be very comical and informative. If anything, I originally subscribed to this channel because it was the only one on youtube that had good scientific evidence about various drugs and their affects on the brain. It's so important for other people to have access to thin information, whether squares find it useless or not. Don't be scared to make more drug or taboo related videos to science, and don't let anyone try to make this page seem any less educational or informative. If anything it's kind of sad to see how stuck people are and how discouraging they are to you guys creative content. I also think it's fair to say the same people hating on this video also hated on the Science of Racism video.
This is fuckin awesome 🤣
Explain evolution while stoned, that would be interesting
HAHA WEEED EPIC 420 RIIITE  hahaha lololol. snope dog plays
This is how I imagine sharing a joint with a medical student would be like
Honestly I love her!!! xD
the nervous system and immune and lymphatic system
Please mic your guests betterrrr. Good information and content deserve good audio quality :'(
Explain how depression works while stoned 😂
Not a fan because I take science serious and thought you did too.............
Honorable mention to the Pancreas and Gallbladder, they're important too.
Stoned Person Tries to Explain Mitosis or the Krebs Cycle
I love this series! 48th comment!!
"Doing the snake but in your body" LMFAO
I agree with everyone else, I like the original videos! Do them again, please.
what the....
I know it's your channel but the previous style is way better.
Its informative, this one is way off.
Omg did anyone else start crying when it said I need fifty more hours 😂😂
EXPLAIN WHAT ALOE DOES FOR SUNBURN
This girl is my mood 24/7
This series is AMAZING
If this applies to bread I'm outta here...
Yea nah this is not what I subscribed for
I should have known this was coming once they did liberals vs conservatives brain scans vid.

I expect them to double down if I have understood anything about sjw culture
Poo town
who else is watching this while eating..?? 😂👍❤
Naw this isn't cool.
It's not funny and barely informative.
Now if you get people like Neil degrass Tyson stoned talking about space that'd be amazing! However someone that really has no idea what they're talking about trying to remember some lines while stone is just awful.
losing the real quality of AsapScience...
This is definitely not what I subscribed for :\
Love ASAP science and love weed but this format don't work.
The superheterodyne radio receiver, mostly because of the groovy name :3
Lol this series is awesome
So I guess this is what I should expect on this channel from now on? Unsub.
Okay this is getting a lot of hate but I really liked it so... keep it up!
You should do one on skin... where does our skin come from....  I also recommend fractals!
I don't understand all the hate comments. I personally enjoyed it, but if you don't like it, then don't watch. They don't owe you any videos, or in particular the ones you specifically want.
This is genius!!!!!
0:50 DHMIS IS BACK!!!
It’s pretty funny and also simple
Love ur vids btw💕
Takes bong hit instantly feels smarter.
I love the editing in these vids. They add so much more comedy 😊
For the next episode you should have Lilly Singh to explain menstrating
Ohhhh I saw that DHMIS clip
ThiS iS nOt FuNnY
StOp iT
😂😂😂
Everyone seems to be hating, but I liked this lol
*stones blunt


My blunt is ruined
Let us know, what are some other scientific concepts you want a stoned comedian to explain: NONE!



I hope that was clear....?
Waaaaayyyyy into this!
I would love to see the speaker smoking the weed. It doesn't have to be over the top or anything I just like watching the act for some reason.
Use to like this channel but just like all the other YouTube channels all it does is weed... and people claim weed isn't addictive..
i really like the videos but the sound has to be worked on. so much echo.
Here Early!
These kinds of videos are so dumb. Please never do them again.
what's up with the audio quality 🤢
Drawing inspiration from Drunk History? Haha
This was fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it 😁 All the edited bits make it even more fun to watch
+500 views and already 14 dislikes. Who comes this early just to dislike?
Can you have Drew Lynch do one?!
Weed+Science+Comedy > Gold+Frankincense+Myrrh
You should let someone explain why we are in a simulation
This is lol and informative and helpful don’t let the hate get to you keep being you I understand this and it’s creative
high af and can feel everything in my stomach now realy
Could you guys talk about chemistry or physics?
Next vid be on action potentials!! Or how we see things
M E M E science
I'd love to see a stoned explanation of time dilation/length contraction
Can you put this on another channel? ASAP Science is informative, and this is...um..ya know.
Sorry, but this was barely informative and really cringe-inducing from start to finish. I would like this channel to stay informative and articulate in its delivery. I understand some people enjoy this format, but please start another channel if these types of videos are going to be posted regularly
Love the video,  maybe get better audio?
Nervous System or Muscular system
I NEED 50 MORE HOURS
Can you do ALL the systems? I thought the respiratory one was funny. It's nice seeing someone casually explain a system from start to end. Last time I watched the respiratory system after finishing that unit and it was just so entertaining.
This is some try hard new age meme attempt
She explained it better than my biology theacher
Please do the circulatory system!
She is doing a lot better than I would’ve. 

Every time I’m stone and I call the pizzeria place, I always struggle saying what I want lol and I will have the order in my head but once they answer I’m like “wait... what do I want? Why am I calling?”
AsapSCIENCE, fans of DHMIS?
Why is the audio quality so awful? My phone would catch a better audio
Asap bs
Swimming class in high school? What fancy high school did she go to? 😂 
I lived in a nice area but we just joked about their being a pool on the 3rd floor. (There was no 3rd floor or pool)
Please go back to doing your normal dry-erase videos. I love you guys and your actual science vids so much, please keep doing those.
This gurl rocks!
I’ve never been so early!!
I love these videos, but the audio quality sucks, I have to be honest.
I learned more from this than Anatomy class last year. Thanks NA education
I learned something again in 5min.... Best teacher ever....  😎🇻🇮
Nuclear Fission/Fusion. Hehehe.
soooooooo..
 drunk history... 
or am I wrong
Can you do a video about thr process of seeing
"And you're bodies all "AHHHHH!" and you're like "Mc Donalds'. lmfao whaaaaAAA?!
How about doing, dreams?
How about doing, dreams?
Black matter or string theory.
this is content I came for
17th man boi
Definitely laughing at you and not with you. 😑
They missed a great opportunity to call the series Schighence
This video wouldve been perfect for studying bio class
Ups I will go and watch your older stuff
I learn more from these than from school lol
"Yaas"

"BRUH"
Either I'm stoned or she explained it better than I could
WTF dude, there is already a killer podcast called STONED SCIENCE.... WTF dudes???
You should do one about eyes and how we see
explained better than my elementary school teacher
0:44 DHMIS!!!
It'd be great if scientists or people in STEM try to explain these concepts!!!
Why do I feel as though I saw her somewhere? 🤔
Atleast they are doing it legally 
Right?
Right?

Right..
This is great 👍🤣
Cardiovascular system!
HORRENDOUS AUDIO LOL
do this
but better
I watched this on the toilet
I am pretty sure that the editor is stoned as well
This is awesome 😂
the title to this series does no justice for this lol
Unsubscribing because of this series - I have nothing against smoking weed, I often do it myself, but it seems like you're focusing more on poking fun of potheads than the actual science.
Kinda hoping it was gonna be a cute white blonde girl 🤷🏼‍♂️
LOL love this new video style from you guys! Informative, entertaining, and engaging all in one!
Explain optics!! :D
It’s churning not peristalsis for the stomach mechanical digestion!!!
Hi
Since when was i underwater 3:13
I knew by the title that this was going to be one of the more disliked asap-videos.
What about the pancreatic excretions and bile from the liver and gallbladder?
This is just like drunk history
OMFG thank you for commenting on my video
Some muscle building science
God damn this channel went downhill quickly.
I love your regular content, but I like this change as well. I've always enjoyed the way you guys make it easy to learn something new. This new show is just another way of doing that. I am a fan of the art and the artists behind this channel. Nothing wrong with trying something new. Thank you for what you do.
This was honestly so funny tbh
2:43 The sound effects KILLED ME here lmaooo
Series is meh
Stoned Science is already a series with a very funny comedian, Kim Congdon
minutephysics, Veritasium, asapSCIENCE, Smarter Every Day, SciShow.  🎶one of these things no longer belongs here 🎶
I enjoy these! Please make more! Easy to listen to and understandable. Super fun and interesting!
Them edits thou xD
Stoned Science: Weather
trying too hard with these edits
Audio was poor.
Just because weed is legal in Canada now doesn't mean all vids gotta be about it 😂
Well done on the editing. Its the bomb
That's not stoned. That's my everyday classmates.
Dang. All these people are so whiney. "It wasn't even informative" um she just explained the entire digestive system. You just don't wanna listen to a stoned person. Ive already learned about the digestive system so its funny to see someone else explain it in this state.
I would prefer having a serious narrator
Explain relativity
Not a huge fan of this format.
What was the editing on this video it does not work for this channel
DHMIS keeps following me. It's weird.
dude


weed
I loved it thank you 😘
i would first give dislike, but then I start listening and I was mesmerized
"Digestion" system
She did a very good job! And she didnt seem stoned at all smsbdns
What do they mean by someone being stoned
I remember when this channel focused on science and not pushing a left-wing agenda.
2:47 The edibles hit.
Still not fun, still not enough weed, she is undistinguishble from a person who has not smoked at all
Like for sativa 
Keep scrolling for indica
This is great timing, i have an exam on this tomorrow lol
I feel like this is the science version of drunk history
These "Stone Science" episodes  are. Freaky hilarious, keep up the good works in the name of science !
I’m surprised she remembered all that while being stoned lol.
This is the first time I've seen this series and im dying  🤣...but learning. ok ok ok so I've seen comments saying it was boring and im scared it might but cancelled if thats the plan PLEASE then move it to another channel for those who like it



Kthxbai😘
"Comedian"
Why would you upload this?
Hahaha this is awesome. I’m a nurse and everything she said is 100% correct. Hilarious to see another medical professional trying to explain something while faded AF 😄. I would definitely do this if ASAP Science is looking for more healthcare professionals 🙌😄
GENETICS!!!
These titles are way too descriptive
Lost a lot of respect for this channel.
Please don't turn into Vice !!
My psychology teacher used to show us videos from this channel but now I see why she stopped
She’s amazing
why is there soooo much hate omg. I for one love this.
Try getting them to explain quantum physics
This is really stupid... please don’t continue this way. 😑
What's going on asap? If yall need a break, take a break we'll understand
This is a lot like drunk history.
She is not stoned enough
Explain evolution
Lots of thumbs down. Take a hint
Omg she's so awesome! I love her lol
Ok, there goes my sub.
Love the little animations
Well I'm ubsubbing because of this nonsense
Unsubscribe
wtf is this channel turning into?
This channel is going so downhill.
The "digestion system", really?
Unsubbed because this channel has gone far from the channel I subscribed to. I wanted to learn new things quickly and easily. No hard feelings, but bye.
Shoulda been named: "Stoned Girl Tries To Explain the Digestive System - Edited by stoned guys"
Astrophysics lmao
Workaholics wants to know your location
In order to find this funny you actually gotta be high lol
This is the worst series on your channel, it kinda turns science into something stupid and vain. I appreciate your other work but this is really bad,
maximum of 50 hours??? for sure? i remember once, when i was little, i didn't poop for one week straight...
First like
Even as a regular weed smoker, that's just a terrible show/idea. Just building up stupid "stoner" cliches. Next time may make a show "alcoholic Girl Tries To Explain the Digestive System | ALCOHOLIC SCIENCE"... sounds super amazing!? s/
What happened to the mic?
I like to talk about my crazy dreams while stoned.
I love your channel, it's informative in a fun and uniques way. But plz dont do such videos. They are useless. Make another channel for these kind of useless videos. Dont spoil my favourite channel plz 😭
I have so many issues with this video... The sound quality...  The comedians that are not funny at all... The idea that this series doesn't feel belonging to this channel...
Very hard to like this at the moment.
I watched this while I was pooping.
I didn’t release the stomach was so high up 🤔🤔🤔
It doesnt feel like shes making a video. Feels like shes trying to convince one of you but still even unsure the entire subject
I learned alot
I didn't think this channel would ever make such a bad video.
If you really think about it everyone  is somewhat like a donut
How u dislike a video JUST because it’s different 😑 read the title and keep scrolling
It's ok to try new things, but at some point you have to realise this is not working.
Now we need DRUNK SCIENCE
Stoned stone explains stones
wtf is with the audio? cant stand it :(
circulatory system
I love this
Remember when AsapSCIENCE was good? I miss those days. Bye guys. Put this crap on another channel, this is not what I subbed for.
I actually liked her
Tamara is all kinds of wonderful
Lmao so many people mad at the creators for trying something new.
please fix the sound in the video
These people are way to articulate to be stoned.
I learned more here then in any science class
stoned person tries explaining cannabis
you like your dugs Asap science.
Ummm this was okay i liked the science more than i did the stoned part. Im faded now it didnt help the science it detracted.
That audio 😅😅😅
and now you’re losing subs
I thought this would be fun to watch while I was eating . 😂
I think it's funny how smoking weed is slowly becoming more socially acceptable. The young the generation of today will make it legal everywhere in the future. 👌
First yeah
Love these vids
Why is a science channel trying to pass off being stoned as something cool?

EDIT: Google "Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use ncbi" for scientific paper.
Weed+girl=dumb^2
This channel really is going downhill now, huh?
It is not cool to promote the use of drugs in a show that's supposed to be about science.
I used to love this channel for being informative but if that's the content you're planning to push, this is goodbye.
This is...…. just gr8
The previous video was much better than this one
were they also high while editing this
I refuse to believe they're all stoned on one joint. They must not smoke often. Also good strains
not a fan.
Her being high isn't what's making me unsub. This segment being on this channel is what did it for me. Deuces✌️
When are they just gonna rename this to AsapDRUGS
This series is very interesting lol
Lol, stoned after 1 joint
I want to see about how the eyes work lol SEE what I did there?
What a dumb segment. As a Dutchy I'm all in favor of the legalization of weed, but there's no need to encourage it or pretend it's hip or something.
It's a mind-altering drug and being happy with your own state of mind should be much more encouraged. Again: I'm all for legalization, but most of the people I've met that smoke weed everyday are a bunch of losers who don't achieve much.
these videos are kinda trashy. who even learns from these vids
I used to really love this channel. 😣
I just smoked a joint and starting watching this... wish me luck!
This the 1st time I've seen a black person on your channel and this  is what you guys present....I suspect this could be an act of racism 

Its not funny at all I followed you guys for years I never saw a black person on here explain anything
Damn never thought about it.
35 seconds is how long I lasted with this video.  Try again.  And easy with the damn lipstick.  Edgy AF.
Wow so progressive guys congrats...........
unsubbed
Dhmis love it
Schrödinger's cat
Who else freaking loves asapSCIENCE?
They’re periodic table of elements song is very useful... I have a test on the first 20 tomorrow, so thanks Greg and Mitch?
The stomach is a lot higher than you think...hmmm never thought about that before. good point. Definitely one of those stoned revelations lol
Early💞
Get the Swampside Chats hosts to do stoned labor theory of value
Reproductive system, I mean c'mon that 'll be hilarious !
This series is trash stick to your roots which was so much more professional
I would love an immunology stoned science. And maybe consider a significantly higher dosage. Tbh this was less stoned science and more low-key and brief. Didn't learn nothing new.
Nice video, but it could have a better audio
Oooh how edgy.
OMG what a great way to make learning fun! I really enjoyed this video and the first one! Please post more!!!! Nervous system  please 😇 thanks!
This she sounds like a he.
I wouldn't be able to get a word out
yep, this channel is definitely accelerating downhill
B6es series
I love the idea for this series, and would love it if you counsidered reaching out to "stoner comedians" like Mike Rita, Daniel Woodrow, Nitish Sakhuja, Sandra Battaglini or Paul Thompson! They are some of my favourites and have been getting stoned and doing comedy in pot lounges for the past few years even before prohibition passed.
Used to love your content but I gotta unsubscribe bc of this, bye 👋🏻
This video was so bad it nearly made me quit weed. Just nearly though.
Could she speak clearer because my mother tongue isn’t English
So damn early
Best asap science video
Well, that does it. After maybe two years of sub-par videos from ASAP science, this video has finally convinced me to unsubscribe.
Your old science videos were awesome , there's no need of uploading this stoned science videos.
Get someone who has no clue of the digestive system to talk about it stoned.
So what, were the editors stoned as well
I gave this video thumbs up cuz of the "hello there" at 3:19 #ObiWan
Stomach has gastric acid
How about fermentation? Beer would be kinda fun, right?
*digestive
I smoke alot of weed and I still think this was a bad idea.
Hormones!!!
get someone to explain celestial gravitation
What's with the audio damn.
.. But, what's the point? She's stoned, ok? She's a comedian trying to explain something a physician should explain? Are we trying to demonstrate something, are we making a point? 
I mean, hooray for legalisation, good on you! But that doesn't mean stoned persons have anything to bring to the table that any non-stoned person wouldn't.
Do photosynthesis next!
I'm surprised this is legal.
eating while i'm watching this
I can smell the weed used in this video
Didn't laugh once
Stoned Science coinciding with legalisation is how I found out you guys are Canadian.  :P
All I see is this blue/purple lipstick. Literally can’t focus on anything else
You should have someone explain photosynthesis!
this channel has turned into a bunch of hippie nonsense with science, sometimes.
This is terrible and the audio quality is cancer, this isn’t it chief, please go back 🙅‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I love the original channel and I like this one as well. But I would highly suggest to create a separate channel just for this kind of content.
Volcanos!!!!!
i am here for the class not for the lass
“You’re body’s just like, ‘AAAAA!!!’ And you’re like, ‘anyway...” 😂
What was the point of this
She's gorgeous!
I would never ask a stoned person to explain science to me... Take that as a hint.
I miss the animation from the one of the respiratory system.
What happen to this YouTube channel hms
stoned science explains vison
I dont know what this channel has become. Really disappointing.
why cant u invest in better audio quality if you have 8 millions subs
Early whip
dude weed lmao
well if this woman was a picture..she would be blurry..... "out of focus" as they say...
Early aye
Next time try scientist on acid   explaining digestion
We want to see Greg and Mitch on stoned science!!
I wanna get stoned now too lol
how to loose  a subscriber: Get stoned. For sure u r gonna get more subscribers from these contents. Good bye
comedian ?
AHHHHHH, But your like McDonald's..... 😂😂😂😂
Please do the respiratory system next
Who edited this video?...  Bit disappointed.
YTP this is
Unfunny Comedian + Not Stoned at all + Recalling how things work from memory = This
Not particularly entertaining. How bout "Drunk, Stoned ramblings by a couple of intelligent, funny people."?
Can a stoned person explain the reason, the event and the results of the Crusade?
Everyone's saying this series is bad. Honestly if she were a lot more stoned, in order to actually make it harder to talk all sciency, this could be pretty hilarious
She should explain the climate change, and propably she would be considered a scientist with subject matter expertise. Just without spending time in cocktail parties.
I smoke weed sometimes but edibles are the shit for me, strong and lasts a long time, plus you can bring it anywhere ;) ... anyways idk what the heck she's talking about but I'm still laughing
is this...legal...?
Drunk History
I had to check twice that I am watching a video from AsapSCEINCE channel because this one is so bad and doesn't match the usual standard. Couldn't even finish watching half of it.
Please never do something like this again.
Okay am I the only one that actually likes this series?
i want to know all about fagness science
120th comment! Lol
Did you sell this channel?
Unsubscribed. not for me thanks
I loved this
Me in science class
I think you should make a song about all USA prezidents, just like the periodic song and the pi song
This is supposed to be a comedian?
First
Damn the audio is godawful, get a 30 quid lapel mic or something jeez.
Bad. Just bad.
Just from the title I can tell that I don't care to watch the video.
I like the idea, though not this specific video. I just couldn't hear her well -- I know you guys have good microphones, so why aren't you using them?
The last episode was way better with the animations and with the actual science of it.
Video about a chubby black woman on drugs, tryin to explain a scienific topic but instead keep swearing and eating. Thats making wrong associations
Yay psuedo science
2:48 I had to pause there.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2:44 lol too funny
still not as bad as the video on the science of racism
I loved the dhmis referance
Dudes! Do waves and visible light! I wanna see some one trip out on rainbows when they're stoned... And explain it to me of course
Mmm those munchies on her lap
Please Asap Science, I used to really like your channel. But even though I'm a stoner myself, I really don't need people I watch for educational purposes to make 10 unfunny stomach action comparisons in a row.
Seriously none of this was entertaining and the few scientific parts completely got lost between all that bs.
I watching this while pooping.
Reproduction explained by stoned people should be next😛
And some say their politics are stupid. What fresh hell is this ?
Can we have a strait male for the next episode or at least someone who is actually funny and know what they are talking about
Back in 1766, a man patient a J shape pipe for sinks to prevent the smell of sewage from going up in the sink. Pretty sure he copied how the stomach is designed.
😂🤣
Early yo
Isn’t peristalsis in your trachea, not your stomach?
I'd love to see Stoned Science on like photosynthesis, and another really good idea would be a stoned person discovering and explaining what the science of them getting high
Is that her voice or is it the audio?
Wait, she was a comedian?
I liked this one more then the other one, but the sound is sucked lol
Comedian? Really.
Who thought this was a good idea?
Literally my school is teaching us this and it took me about about a day and half and everything I learned is in this video and the worse part is i still have so much more to read
This is what happens when drugs become legal
Chips aren’t mainly starch
first?
I thought that this was a science channel
I love the weird al mention :)
My name is Tamara 😏
Well this channel always tell people what they want to hear not what they need to hear so i'm not supprise when see this 🙄
do one with shaggy
Why cant you ever bring on a person like myself that is functional when stoned? Not everybody gets giggly and loses their place.
Where is the comedian? I was promised a comedian.
13th
i want stoned science to cover like any semi complicated astriphysical phenomenon, like the life cycle of a star or pulsar or black hole
Plain white sauce makes your teeth go grey
Can you do “why are we afraid of spiders”?! I was surprised to see you hadn’t already done it!
DUDE
Yall are hating they just wanted to do a fun animation
Y'all know that that's not a girl right? It's a trans dude.
Stone Science explaining what does marihuana does to your body!
Synapses
Yaaaaaaaas
So many down votes?! This video was super fun. I loved their guest and she did a good job (aside for leaving out the colon). If you have a problem with cannabis, just move on. How dare people learn and have fun?!?!
Yeah "stoned"
I like the use of animations. It's good that it's not just whiteboards anymore. Thumbs up
I remember when asap science was good
Marijuana is now legal in Michigan...Just throwing that out there :)
LOL
Lol this is jokes.
I think it's great to keep putting up cannabis-related educational and/or comedy videos. It keeps me informed. If it weren't for this channel I wouldn't even know the mechanisms. Yes, I've researched. Yes, I've experienced. Your videos help me understand it better. I just want to say Please continue making STONED SCIENCE and other videos. I would hate it if yall discontinue just because of the hate comments and dislikes. I think everyone could benefit from learning and seeing more of its effects. And if they're not interested then they simply just have to not-click. Unsubscribing is rude and most ppl probably didnt even do it just like spreading hate and negativity and want to threaten you into giving them what they want. Regardless, videos will still be watched.
Perfect timing. I’m learning about this in bio class and shitting right now couldn’t be better timed.
Why did I watch this?
Yeah, sorry. I unsubbed because of this series.
If u actually smoke weed this is incredibly unfunny
Is nicotine  safe or unsafe for health
Too many cuts tho...
Yay more fake stoned people... Why the faking though? Is it illegal to show yourself publicly while under influence or something?
Now I have proof weed doesn't decrease your intelligence
What happened to the sound?
Is this legal?
Why glorify weed?
Brain chemistry!
OMG yes
I want more stoned science
2:49
Reported for promotion of drugs and unsubed
Bones
This was painful...
This will be interesting...
I see comedian is used very loosely here
wow, this is horrible. bring back the type of videos from like a year ago.
i'm starting to get worried here............................. you guys are doing alot of "science" on drugs, i don't think that's a good thing
In my opinion I think it would be better if you guys were stoned and explaining it. But otherwise I love it
What happened to this channel? If someone showed this to me beefier I watched it I would not have known it was by asap science. Fix urself. I liked y'all before.
First
First
Bloody liberals
Funny, I'm no different stoned.
Ya’ll lost me
Bro
None we don’t want to see anymore of this
Oh no, I don’t like where this channel is going
Oi
Boo
is it bad to smoke weed everyday?
This is what diversity looks like.
stoned science is my favourite. im still chanting about Miss Epiglotissss. the bouncer of the respitory system
So far I've thoroughly disliked both of your Stoned Science videos. I smoke weed, but this isn't enjoyable or funny, like at all.  And it's barely informative. I doubt these people even have a clue what they're talking about.
I'm subscribed to this channel for science, not for so-so comedy, and not to watch some dummy that's high and acting like a teenager who just smoked for the first time.
the audio is terrible in this
loly
Crap content
It's sick
Purple lip on blackness no
First
what a ridiculous video :'(
I have no opinion on this video, it was rather tedious to watch though
😂😂😂
Why?.. just..why?
The Big Bang.
1 joint? Get y’all tolerance up yo
Drunk history much???????
She's a highentist!
Tell us how the elements were made while stoned
People complaining about it not being funny. And scraping the bottom of the barrel and all this. But 1: It's still about science and education ya idjits! I mean, you still learned something didn't you? And if you didn't, good for you. Help spread the knowledge. And 2: I thought she was funny and cute.
Creating comedy out of drug abuse isn't cool, especially when the drug causes so many mental health issues that people struggle with every day....
Lel
Dudes, you should totally get someone to explain the universe and our significance in it. Or get me to do it. I could totally explain that high and with my hands tied behind my back. The universe is my jam!
thats ....CRAP SCIENCE hahhaahahhahahhahhahahhakillme
I get that this was meant to be funny but guys...it didn't work the way you had intended it to.
Drugs are so cool
Very bad audio
I like her as a person.  She's fun.  But this format is weak.  And, kind of messed up.  I mean, imagine if it was "drunk science."
So many hate comments... It's so easy, if u don't like something, do not comment, just leave, ez pz
Yo
what the...
WhU...........wHy
Horrible audio on this video and she talks very unclearly, difficult to understand what shes saying.
The audio is crap
2:11 terror sites lol (with subtitles on)
yeet
Okay guys, are you a comedic channel or an informative channel? Because you need to draw a line (just take one look at the comments)
Fffirst
Soooooooo Cool
What happened to asap science
Ok this was the dumbest 💩 you guys have done... please don't do it again. I couldn't even watch have way through it.
Love it
ok
no
Where’s the liver ?
Why?
What happens when you eat too much food
They must be stoned to think that this series is funny
Strange video, but funny
I wish she went more in-depth. The small intestine’s villi absorb nutrients out of the goo your stomach turned the food into. The large intestines pull moisture and any remaining nutrients out of the fecal matter. This is why you get constipated when you don’t drink enough water, and why you have diarrhea when you’re sick.
All the comments about "this channel is dying" and etc, just keep in mind that they are still gained 50k subs last month alone. But is still recommend for making this on a different channel or something, because so many are against weed. The idea about this is cool, but it just does not work that well, being bit too ridiculous for people not high.
she's funny coz she's fat,.....and also black
Not into this, sorry. saying like a lot and mumbling information actually isn't better than your normal videos.
TF
We get it this channel likes weed but I came here to watch good science videos...
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢
It’s digestive.......
cringe
why
why is this a thing
This comment section is so negative 🙄
You really need to change the name of this series. Comedians Kim Congdon and Sara Weinshenk already have a series with this name.
Why is the audio so bad? Its not the only thing keeping me from watching but its a majority of why its bad. Me not liking the comedy, the flow of info and its depth, animation and gifs. Those things i dont like but thats subjective. The audio is objectively bad.
umm... i thought food goes to the gallbladder first? i know this cause i had mine removed at 14, and that’s what my surgeon had told me. correct me if i’m wrong please.
I know this is a change guys, but this is still science related plus even more entertaining! Besides, they're in Canada, and our prime minister legalized weed not too long ago so it's still relevant.
Cringe
For all the people complaining about this series, know that this is content that's going to appeal to some audience that you might not be a part of. Just relax, they will still upload and produce videos like the ones people are used to, the fact is a lot of people will find this kind of content interesting, funny and relatable and if that means more people checking out the rest of ASAP science content I'm all up for it.
Dumb
Yikes
Nope
No.
If you guys don't like the video then don't watch the video ..........
This is just trash
I dont like this. Drugs are drugs and I don't like you forcing them, acting like its most ordinary thing.
I usually like this channels content, but this is something I expect Buzzfeed to put out, not this channel.
This sucked.
This sucks. There is no need for this series here.
Wtf is this series
I’m sorry, but this channel has become cancer. 
People in STEM aren’t brain-dead-pot-heads. I think that says enough about what audience they’ve begun catering to. When this channel became more popular it began feeling so buzzfeed-like. It’s a shame because there used to be genuinely informative content posted here. What a waste. 

inb4 “Elon Musk smokes weed!”
That’s why NASA just launched a wide scale safety probe on SpaceX, causing several launch setbacks and the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars…
Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Am I the only one who doesn't find this funny at all? :/
great video, fun to watch
Sometimes I wonder why I’m subbed to this channel, it’s not funny and political
How would YouTube allow this girl took drugs decide make video
Why do you have to bring drugs into this?! Unsuscribing
This was the last straw. Not sorry for unsubscribing.
If you think about it, humans are just large meat donuts
Cringe
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, I'm gone (unsubscribed).
y’all get john mulaney on here.... you’re gonna be swimming in ad sense cash
Achievement achieve, explain digesting system while stoned
(Reward: hmmm....)
This is just another buzzfeed channel.
Soooo bad
Bai
I like the regular episodes. This was garbage. And she wasn’t funny at all, so I don’t know how you can call her a comedian.
I don’t get why there are so many dislikes
You know you have a problem when you're a science channel yet you put out videos that feel like buzzfeed
I don't understand what she's saying. And it's also chaotic and not interesting or funny at all. Well she's high and I'm not I guess....
I love these!! I watched the other one while I was high and I literally thought I was gonna die from laughing💀
Might have to unsubscribe if this keeps up. This kind of crap is NOT why I subscribed to you.
kept subscribed only to be the first one to rant in the newest video. This cannel cannot have the word 'science' in it and preach such a huge, biased, pile of BS and push this to over 8mio subscribers? that's insane! I'm made as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
She’s... a comedian? It’s getting close to unsubscribe o’clock
No. Terrible.
Great great video guys!!
How is it your channel can do this, but people are banned because they advertised CBD oil?
Comments: This channel is going downhill and this video sucks but let me like it anyways.
McDonalds💩💩
Mastigaytion mmmmmwooooow
Why is the audio so bad? you have 8 mil subs and cant even get audio right? this channel is going downhill
This was disgusting, and that "woman" is not funny at all, just obese and uggly.
Yeah I think it's time to unsubscribe lol
What a stupid video
She's the only one who finds this funny.
Stoned comedians should do the reproductive system, or explain fertilization to child birth
Why so many dislikes, this is funny and educational.
Why? Unsub
Facepalm
Please... don’t do this... Stop trying to be a stoner channel.
?
This series is horrible content, unsubbin
Science and drugs? This channel sucks more and more.
Stoned "girl"? She's clearly a grown woman and I would appreciate if a science channel like yourselves would use the proper word to refer to a woman. Women are not girls. Girls are children. You called her a comedian in the video and description, why isn't that good enough for the title? Y'all didn't say stoned boys in the last one, so please consider the word you use for adult female humans.
Baby 👶🏻 making science!
Is this where the channel is going...? I repected this channel but it's turning into a clown show
Anyway, McDonalds.
why is everyone hating on this.. i mean i get that some people don't like getting stoned but still. i don't support smoking etc. but i find this funny and i even learn something. if you don't like it don't watch it. s i m p l e
This channel has gone so downhill it’s pathetic
Sorry but its time for me to unsub... We had a good run... We had a good run.
Channel going downhill
This is better than the first episode but... still mediocre.  Is smoking up needed for this to be funny?
I just find it silly to do a video around Marijuana for the sake of making one. What's funny about someone explaining things stoned? I can't help but feel like this video reeks 'we smoke Marijuana and it's cool'. Don't get me wrong I smoke lots of joints, but this just seems like a bit unnecessary. Keep the Mary Jane to yourselves.
Rubbish - That’s it I unsubscribeed
Buy
These videos are kinda racist against weed. Not a fan, please stop, pretend you never made these and let's all move on with our lives.
I've never see someone so unfunny while high. How is that possible? And she's supposed to be a comedian???
Bye
What is this? Buzzfeed?
Love this series!
Not funny :/
This series is horrible please stop
These commentors are way too entitled and democratized. Just ignore any content you don't enjoy. They're only suffering from your wanton dislike bandwagoning, when otherwise you could be tolerant.
Is this a real female?
By
Guess it is time to unsubscribe...
these dislikes are ugly, jus because weed is involved doesnt mean they dont know what theyre talking abt if anything its just adding humor
un subbing .. bye bye
Im drunk right now and her thought process is exactly the same as mine and it hurts my brain
Why feature a comedian when it's barely funny? This is probably the worst marriage of science and comedy I've seen, not really learning, not really laughing. It would probably be more funny, if you did this to an actual scientist, a really serious and conservative one.
Bi
Please describe degenerative diseases
Maybe its an American thing but.... do you lot always act more stoned than you are? Maybe Its because ive been smoking so long? But if i needed too i could coherently explain anything whilst stoned.....probably without people even knowing.
This is idiotic
Why didn’t you make this video earlier, I just had a test on this yesterday!
bye
God exists because sciennce
Unsubscribe!
Not funny at all
Boring
I came for the comment section. 







These weed videos are always really controversial lol
Wow dum
Do something drunk.....





That's going to be fun
el fagos
I don't understand why people are so upset. It doesn't HAVE to be put on another channel, it's a different series so it's distinguished itself enough from the rest of their content and as long as they produce the content you're used to in a timely manner then I have no qualms and neither should you. It's informative and in ways broken down a bit further to be easier to DIGEST (sorry couldn't help it) for those who are not as science savvy.
pathetic
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL AND THIS IS THE BEST SERIES IDEA MMMMMM
When does she sounds like a dude?
Trash.
Um.
This series is great! Would love to see someone do something astronomy related like binary star systems or the formation of galaxies
She's cute. All these stoned, learned comedians are somehow adorable.
green bubble: BRUH
A lot of people seemed to like the guys episode so now I’m trying to understand why they on this episode whining. If you don’t like it don’t watch it💁🏽‍♀️
There's people so ignorant that they think they have the right or entitlement to tell them what kind of videos to make.
A gently reminder: "IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU DON'T NEED TO WATCH IT" you know why? because you're not contributing to anything.
And some of you may say: "My views give them money" so there you go... Don't watch it if you don't feel like giving money to something you don't like. Don't tell them to change the content to fit your requests. This is not Macy's lol.
You're not a customer, you're a consumer.
There is going to be a lot of people that they will watch it regardless.
Love the series guys. Keep em coming. Maybe do the nervous system, circulatory system, etc. Reproductive system should be funny.
only one blunt.
who else watches this high???
This was so good in so many ways
Please stay a science channel. This is clickbaity
drunk science is way better
This is cool and all but stick to what you've always been doing.
Why is every one mad? Why can’t they try something new?
Who's watching this stoned?
This channel is going downwill
I love when stoned people try to explain things.
