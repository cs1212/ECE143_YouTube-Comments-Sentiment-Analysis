Religious or not   - this sad to see because it’s a treasure to the world. Built in the 12th century 1160AD 
Heart Breaking
This building is sooooo beautiful inside and outside and it’s been iconic in Parisian history. This one hurts 🤯🤯🤯
I am really feeling sad. It's a Marvel that Humanity achieved in terms of engineering and architecture.

I am a Hindu, but still my aches to see such wonder getting burnt. We used to have this picture in our History book(part of Indian Social Studies syllabus), as kids we used to get awed by this Cathedral. 

I have hope in French Govt, they will do a great job in restoring this.
So much History and relevance to the entire world.,gone in the blink of an eye.`Paris`we stand with you in sorrow and unity 🙏🏽.
I'm not even from Europe and I'm crying
I’ve never visited Notre Dame and now it looks like I’ll never have the chance anymore :(
I’ve been there. It’s indescribably magnificent. I’m HORRIFIED!
One of the World's most beautiful buildings. It must be restored. The glass was incomparable. So sad.
This is the most visited cathedral in europe this is a hit to the whole of human civilization!

Ps. Don't respond or react to the trolls please ignor them and don't read their bile!
This is astounding. I was there, in Paris two weeks ago... It was my first time. I was sketching this.... I was eating there. This is devastating. My prayers are with the people of Paris.
Norte Dame is not just a cathedral, it is a symbol of western knowledge and the site of one of the first universities in the modern world. This has much greater symbolic significance than most people are prepared to understand
This is very sad, a building from the 11th century.
I just don`t know what to say.
A absolute nightmare.
Sending my Prayers to Paris! The world is watching we love you!!!!!
I always wanted to go there ever sense I was younger, I guess missed my chance 😭
The most visited (30K per day) monument in France is up in flames. Sad!
My husband and I have been in a queue of people wanted to visit Notre Dame. He did not want to wait so long. Now that chance will never come again. Never wait if you have the possibility to do something especially. It could be the only chance you will ever get. So sad.
Le cœur des Français est en train de brûler. C'est un horrible désastre national.
I´m a full grown man now , but this hurts , this really hurts like a punch in your guts and soul
So sad. Hope for the best.
The world must help France rebuild this historic treasure if it can be.  Such a sad, sad thing to happen.  I have never been there, but this is painful to watch.
For nearly 1000 years it’s stood. It has achieved an a on the test of time, and yet here it is taken from us, just because of some renovation work.
I visited noter dame caterdral in 2018 it was very good and beautiful its to sad its on fire ;(
I hope they will be able to rebuild. This is a gorgeous building
Our lady, our hearts goes out.
I’ve been there and it is so sad because it is the most recognizable and beautiful cathedral
Hold the cross high so I may see it through the flames.
(Joan of arc)
This has to be on purpose. Survived all these years, and then this???? It’s stone. Hmmmmmmmmmm
And this is what happens when you have a twisted moron like macron to run your country. Stuff like this happens.
Totally sad!!!!  A beautiful Cavaille-Coll organ is in there.
I’ve never gone to visit but this still hurts to watch. :(
This is very sad....😓😓😓
I am glad I had a chance to see this church building...
This loss of History, Art and Architecture just leaves me speechless......
Now I want to watch The Hunchback of Notre Dame just to watch the amazing detail.
Just more European history down the drain. If the regressive leftists had it their way a mosque will be erected in its place
Watch what happens in the next couple days....  they'll blame the "yellow vests"  Macron is an old Rothchild banker.... open your eyes   something stinks !!!!
I grew up in Paris.  I can't tell you how many times I have been in the Notre Dame.   It is an architectual wonder.   The building is just amazing.  Was amazing.  like stepping back 200 yrs.  This is a great loss.   My family and I can't beleive this is happening.    We are just heartbroken.
Insert Burzum music in the background and enjoy!!!
R.I.P. Quasimodo! =‘(
There is a scaffolding on the cathedral.
So my educated guess is that some worker screwed something up.
Happened to a church in my hometown, too - some 11-12 years ago.
A cigarette not properly stubbed out before throwing it away, or a welding torch carelessly handled...et voila.
Frenchmen do not fight Nazi's  Or put out fires !
So very Sad. Hearts and souls are breaking all over.
The revenge of Quasimodo!
Do we know who/what did this ??? I'm on holiday day in France next week sadly to say not in Paris to share shock and grief. My thoughts are with you all in Paris r.i.p Notre-Dame xx
Macron will build a mosque there.
Western Civilisation is under attack
OMG this is so heartbreaking......😖
Literally a river right next to it
😲 Someone is going to have some serious splaining to do. And why am I not seeing any firemen, trucks, or hoses, or did I miss something?
Wow, Ken was one of the last people to be inside the Notre Dame Cathedral.
France needs to come back to Christ...
On the scaffold , constant flame stove without smoke. Fire is fed by constant gas supply.gas pipe.
Unfortunately，Historical artifacts are great，I hope that you can rebuild this great building，from china，If there is a rebuilding donation, I will definitely donate 1,000 euros, even though I am only a student.
Incalculable loss to civilisation.
I was just there last November, Notre Dame was such a magnificent architectural wonder. I hope they save it.
so sad. I can't see the firefighting going on.
My heart breaks with you Quasimodo
They need to find out how this  happened
THIS IS NOOOOOOOOO ACCIDENT PEOPLE✔✔✔✌
Arson? Accident? Act of, ironically, God?
Seigneur, que Dieu bénisse cette maison que Paris, en France, a gardée pendant mille [1000] ans. Merci à Dieu, la couronne d'épines a été préservée. Merci à Dieu, le célèbre orgue de Notre-Dame a été préservé. Merci à Dieu, la Croix d'or a été préservée. Seigneur, nous te demandons d'étendre tes mains ✋ ✋vers cette cathédrale de louange, de délivrance, de prémices et de culte. . . Notre Dame Paris, France. . . montrez-leur que votre main ne tarde pa guérir et à restaurer.

Kyrie, eleison. . . Christe, eleison. . . Kyrie, eleison.
Sad, sad very sad, France is dog gone, down the drain.
Is beyond my Comprehension,  why they did n`t have an sprinkle system.
Let's do a crowdfunding to restore it
So sad. The paintings the history are gone.
Some people did something.  Right Omar?
What started the fire?
Surrounded by river too
😢 from France
850 years old Charge Survived history Franc
same happened in brazil...something ain't right
thank you France
I've never been there.. I hope the damage will not be as massive as it looks. It's just a building but there is SOOO much history, people, stories tied to it..
Huge loss for all of us.
My heart goes out to Paris.
To the people of Paris i am so sorry for this tragic loss .
It's so sad! I hope they can put it out before it spreads.
quasimodo will have the hump over this
A piece of history is burning down..
Coincidentally during this Easter happened where the people from entire world needed it most...survived many wars and revolutions for 855 years and yet it burned for an instance.
This was  good to see 😉
As a Muslim we with you in this precious loss and condolence
What a shame.  Hopefully no one got hurt.
I THINK ISREAL HAS ALOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO.....
So sad so much history in the Building
A Notre Dame spokesman said the interior is entirely broken.
Notre Dame is so hot right now.
renovation company has left the chat
Another victim of Trumpophylium Destructivorum
Not very much into prayer.

That's still devastating, a human mark that will be mourned for years to come.
This is astounding!!!!
Why is there no water on  this fire?
My heart just tears when I watch this.

I remember when Windsor Castle burned. I visited it last summer. You would never have known.  

I am reminded of the awful earthquake in Assisi Italy when the Franciscan cathedral collapsed. Through many years and hard work, that church did rise.

But this looks a lot worse. 

I just hope that there are thorough detailed studies and inventory and reproductions of every item and surface of Notre Dame because this fire is going to melt the stained glass windows, turn all the wood and paintings into ash, blow up the stone and statues.


But why...why....did it take so long to get water on to the cathedral????
Lord have mercy
Dammit, Frollo.
Is this a sign of the end?
no way :(
The roof is on fire.
It took 2 hours for the fire  brigades  to arrive and the free mason media has already stated NO arson  is involved. How do they know. because  they are free masons n free masons burnt The Churche before Good Friday cause they know millions will be Praying  at That Very Church
Such a complete and utter loss....Gone forever.Horrible camera person constantly pan zoom in and out has to be worst ever!!!
so sad i dident visit it yet 
big lose for humanity
but all must be more sad that years ago we lost 5 thousand year old historical in iraq and syria
"  When Frollo says run away with me or die, you can guess which one she chooses. As Frollo is laughing at the release of Esmeralda from his life, Quasimodo, in anger, pushes him off a balcony from the cathedral where Frollo falls to his scorching death " from the disney movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Co incident? Or Prediction?
France died as a state, because this nation had already died
ᚺᚨᛁᛚ᛫ᛟᛞᛁᚾ᛫ᚺᚨᛁᛚ᛫ᚨᛊᚨᛏᚱᚢ᛫
humanity has lost one of its architectural wonders ..... it can not be replaced ....
Liberals attacking.
Oh Noooooooo! I visited this cathedral when I went to Paris! This is awful! 😧
Thank God France is a big time supporter of Christianity unlike CNN and much of the media. All the people that will rebuild the cathedral  with the Catholic community is a great thing. In Jesus name amen.
It is just a sign that a century is finished when this holy place turned into ashes.......but new century is going to start.....so it will be rebuilt and more history will be added on.........that is why we have more books to reads.......
"Oh Babylon, Babylon...I will destroy your idols in one hour"- God Almighty
what happened??..what made it burn???
If Notre-Dame Gets replaced by a mosque...

I don't know, but Europe needs help.
Europe, do you wanna be a Third world country? Is it why you keep letting those people flood your streets?
Just seeing such a beautiful and historic landmark getting destroyed makes me sad... I hope this was not deliberate...
This better not be a terrorist attack
The religion of peace probably did it
I am angry😈
Is it Terrists
This worls is slowly coming to an end. The history and all the darkness from the church is coming to an end wonder what their trying to hide now these kind of buildings just dont burn like this.
thats an attack against christianity its not just notre dam its many more churches around france
@ 0.24s the satan appeared in the smoke same as when Twin Towers were burning on Sep 11 2001
Where's is the fire trucks??
So sad... 😢
no fire figthing helicopters with the river next door??????
Frollo did it
god bless all people in the world ............
Obviously the cathedral represented a FALSE RELIGION and God let their gods house burn to the ground. In fact all curches, mosques and tembles are the houses of false gods.
the bells, the bells, bit of a coincidence that Quasi  went out to buy a duck not long after the fire started, just saying
OMG OMG  what happens. The facade was built in such a way that it will stand but the rest, my god the history how did this happen? 
Heart breaking
Turquie mensonge du génocide arménien prophète Jésus vous aime pas
paris has fallen
Now I know why Eastern Europe has closed its borders
Stupid questions
This is so sad
The war between good and evil has begun. Not sure if people are paying attention.
Nooooooooooo!! Omg
Where did I leave my mixtape?
Coming so close to Easter suspicions of arson come to mind. If so then who would be most suspect...hmmm...someone who hates Christianity...maybe a group new to France that doesn't hold this place sacred. You figure it out.
It's not about how much we lost   its about how much we have left
It is not just a loss to Catholics and France, it's a loss to western civilization.  I'm an American atheist and I mourn its loss.
800years rip
Allah, blessed this day, made space for a new mosque.
We will
 rebuild. Yeah right a church satan
Wow. That hunchback's Organ Solo really was fire
Well.................that's a shame
The job of MSNBC is to narrate how completely gone it is and make the world believe it's an accident. This is ARSON just like the other churches recently burned in France. It's evil in action.
People say its the "Fall of Western Civilization" but the thing is even though it was a tragedy it isnt a fall of a civilization.
6.8 million restoration project but not 10$ for a fire extinguisher. Sprinkler system? Shower? Genetic flammable low bid trees or climate change?
天道好轮回，苍天饶过谁
I was planning on going to Paris and seeing it when I was older but now it’s just ..
Serves them right for all those boy rapes they've committed and covered up for decades!
So very heartbreaking! Love and prayers to Parisians and France.  A cherished landmark and artistic treasure that graced the landscape for centuries!  No words - it’s a heart rending tragedy. Very upsetting for art and history lovers the world over.😭
I'm not religious at all.  But this is sad given its history and engineering beauty.

Just curious, catholics, is this "part of the plan"?





I'll see myself out...
The best way to know why is happened is what decision will be made. What will they build? Will they rebuild or put something else there?
Truly a huge loss for Paris, France, and the rest of the World!  Perhaps this event will bring people in this world together.
I have a hunch Isis or something is behind this
I hate this. I hope they rebuild it, it won't be the same but I feel like it has to be done.
GOOOOOD
I want to make a Frollo Hellfire joke right now, but that would be in such bad taste that even I can't bring myself to. 

Really, I'm at a loss for words. Even as a staunch atheist, I desperately hope something of it can be saved. This place, religious or not, is such an iconic and storied historic landmark.
What is the reason of this catastrophe?
Very very sad news...My prayers are for the people.
MSNBC tell me Orange man bad.
Last month, at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles, in north-central France, a statue of the Virgin Mary was found smashed, and the altar cross had been thrown on the ground, according to  La Croix International, a Catholic publication.

Also in February, at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, in south-central France, an altar cloth was burned and crosses and statues of saints were smashed. The attack prompted Lavaur Mayor Bernard Canyon to say in a statement: “God will forgive. Not me.”

And in the southern city of Nimes, near the Spanish border, vandals looted the altar of the church of Notre-Dame des Enfants (Our Lady of the Children) and smeared a cross with human excrement.
It's sad
This is so sad, many years ago me and my sister visited notre dame  cathedral it is one the beautiful place to visit when you are in paris.
first the rise of religious violence in France now the Catholic church burns down..i wonder..before that 17 march another church almost burnt down ..bring the immigrants ..you guys are doing well wakaka
Something tells me there is something unscrupulous and sinister going on here.
This is a False Flag.
The French, your soldiers killed and destroyed in many aggressive wars. For example, Yugoslavia, Libya, Syria. Your cathedrals are just from what you stole in the world during the colonization of America, Africa.
Now there will be a French mosque. I write to you from Slovakia. You are a deterrent example of immigration to us. You can get it for yourself.
The right thing to do is to Rebuild the NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL.
If you are a Human being who cherishes life, Morals,and Freedom From all Evil,Then you would support fixing it.
So many people's ancestors were baptized and have taken faith in Paris because of the NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL. 
French people(Religious or not) need to Stand up & do what truly is right.
 Also anyone who commited this crime & Those involved Should be Brought to Justice and be PERMANENTLY HELD RESPONSIBLE.
 It's obvious this was a covered-up Crime. If it looks suspicious, that's because it IS Suspicous.


La bonne chose à faire est de reconstruire la CATHÉDRALE NOTRE DAME.
Si vous êtes un être humain attaché à la vie, à la morale et à la liberté, vous voudriez qu'il soit réparé.
Alors beaucoup d'ancêtres ont été baptisés et ont fait confiance à Paris À cause de la CATHÉDRALE NOTRE DAME, .
les Français (religieux ou non) doivent se lever et faire ce qui est vraiment juste.
 De même, quiconque a commis ce crime et les personnes impliquées devraient être traduits en justice et tenus responsables de manière permanente. Il est évident qu'il s'agissait d'un crime dissimulé. Si cela semble suspect, c'est parce qu'il est suspect.

Awww, everyone is SO sad. Thing is, you know who did it. errrrr, hmmm some people from the middle east perhaps? They tried before didn't they fools. Thing is, the people of France WILL NOT BE TOLD THE TRUTH. Don't want to insult the people from the middle east. World trade center (check), Notre Dame (check), next ? When will people wake up to what is happeneing???
Research Dresden, Tartaria, Worlds Fairs Buildings Destroyed, Iraq museum looted....you will start to get a bigger picture.
:(
Good Lord, there are so many idiots here in the comments bringing politics into this. People, a piece of history is burning down. I'm not usually one to swear but for the sake of everyone please calm down and have some f*cking respect.
This is horrible. 😢
We were most upset to hear about the terrible fire of the Notre Dame Cathedral.
What a sad thing it is ! 
It's sad for people all over the world. It is sad for us Japanese, too. One year after the great East Japan earthquake of March 11, 2011, we know that about 2,000 people, such as the citizens of Paris, attended, and the mass was dedicated to the affected areas of the Japan and the victims in the Notre Dame Cathedral.  We wish you all the best in this hard tIme. From Japan
I don’t live in Paris in France; but I’m a Catholic and Christian and this hurts; because I never got to see the inside of this building and reading the comments; I don’t know if I every was going to see it; but now I wish I had seen the inside of it; because it sounds like it was really beautiful and pretty inside
That's what happens when you let sand people in the country!!!!
Maybe God was not powerful enough to quench this conflagration?....or did not want to intervene....or doesn't exist....please humanity pick one.
where will the child molesters go?
10 churches were burnt down in France the last weeks!!! This one too.
It wasn't an accident. Wake up.
Million of 3rd world muslim economic refugees welcomed to Europe what did you expect?
FROLLO DID THIS. Okay I know that joke is in bad taste considering what a tragically serious matter this is. But I cant help but see the irony in this
Hopefully there's plenty of building/fire experts in the comments; I would hate to be let down..............
Wow
This is terrible. There goes a real piece of history. That building is more than 800 years old. :(
Trump did it, yeap. Trump is the explanation for all disasters.
I don't even pratice this churchs religion but just watching history buring and being destroyed is making me sob my eyes out
This has been another moment in PC and diversity at any cost   ...so why won't any world leader deport  them? why no halt to further immigration?  Why is having them more important than our lives or civil rights?   There is military in Paris and drones with cameras yet they still can't stop terror.. Only deportations can save the west.    World wide CW is coming as our leaders have deserted us in favor of this cult in turbans
Very sad.
Despite the ignorant Americans who make fun of the French or the changing political atmosphere we the people of the United States have always stood with the people of France in fraternity and Liberty. Our nation was founded upon their principles and our founding fathers stood side-by-side with the French as we gained our own liberty and freedom. We have always come to their aid and will continue to do so. It's sad to see such a magnificent structure burning but buildings can be rebuilt. This is about our mutual people. Vive La France! Vive la liberte!
Isis....
The French are so dramatic I just heard a french guy on the news compare this to  September 11th lmao. Nobody even died and nobody outside of France really cares.
That's one heck on a renovation!
God’s Wrath: A Message to the World

This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross (Acts 2:23). For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. (Romans -18).
I’m supposed to go to Paris in exactly one month & I can already tell my experience is going to be greatly altered. I feel terrible for the people of Paris & France in general. I know how much this place means to them, & it means so much to many others around the world. I’m grateful it looks like nobody was hurt, but this is very sad to see.
That’s so sad you don’t need to be catholic to understand the history and religious lose
I hope Quasimodo made it out safely.
A mosque will  be built in its place
Very sad.
France no longer has a heart.
PMSnbc second most fake news a board or two.  what a bunch of dumbasses
why no one is trying to put the fire out? Where are the helicopters????
Breaks my heart let'S PRAY TOGETHER
Erdoghan did it.
Only Erdoghan dares doing this.
Erdoghan did it.
Enjoy Islam ,French people.
Sad......
You know Quasimodo predicted this.
Stop doing little boys I hope it burns down completely u sick people
In France (since the beginning of February) there have been more than 10  attacks on Christian churches, some burned  and other suffering acts of desecration.  St. Sulpice, the second-largest church in Paris after Notre Dame Cathedral, was one of these. Investigators confirmed that the March 18th fire was started deliberately.
Muslim pos did it.
Centuries gone, to dust in the. When America was just a thought to the philophers of France. Seems prophetic, with all the allegations against the Catholic Church, what is next for this great religion that has shaped our humanity, can it find a porpoise again?
I'm kind of interested will Notre Dame be the Joan of Arc 2019, will it help rally France in the midst of the " yellow Jackets". Certainly with such a monument of humanity Emanual Macron the Radical Centerist will have the sympathies of the world. No one died but the history alone lost, is comparable to 9/11, only where do we go from here, to pare phrase Le Monde Are we all Norte Dame today?
Such a revered structure does not just catch fire by accident, even with renovations in progress. This fire was a deliberate act, very likely a coordinated and well planned event.
IF the muslims are to blame for the burning,  they will pay !!!!
No,no,no,no,no,😳😭😭😭😭😭
This the perfect visual of the current state of France. Her culture, religion, history, patriotism, and national pride is going up in flames
9/11 Taught us that metal burns and melts because of fire,? Why is the Scaffolding standing? Is anyone waking up???????????  "I Pet Goat" said it was coming down, BEFORE it happened!
Figures released by French police showed that 875 of France’s 42,258 churches were vandalised last year.
Was Mohammed working on that Cathedral?
NOOO MIO DIO...
But it's not collapsing at freefall speed?
NOW WHEN ARE THE MUSLIMS GOING TO TAKE CREDET FOR THIS ?
Our prayers are with Quasimodo right now
Frollo burned all evidence of his harassment  of Esmeralda
Russians suffer for the French. Pray for you
It was God's will. This is a remainder that you shouldn't put a flag of fake country in holy place
I hope the Hunchback got out OK.
Wow I love old building's this is just sad  the only thing I could say about this is like 9/11 all over again and just imagine if the white house was in this kind of destruction the people of not just france but world are completely traumatized by this it's good that no one was killed and you know what else it always seem's that it's predicted in some type of media look back movies like the hunch back of Notre dame and the ending of the valley of gwangi nobody could have ever think that something like this would ever happen and I don't know what could happen next this year I hope everyone stays safe and is ok well maybe in the future this landmark will rise from the ashes of destruction
Accidental? Arson?
Wonder If the muslims had something to do with this.
It survived hundreds of years, 2019 by fire? Doesn't make any sense...
It is Holy Monday... Jesus cleansed the temple on this day. Coincidence ?
A 859 year old building doesn't just magically catch fire, foul play is in order
Honestly i still don’t get why they aren’t using planes. Most likely the cathedral will burn down
Don't worry after it burns down they will replace it with a beautiful mosque.
Trump Turds running amok!
I wonder if this was because "Some People did something"?
I think the media will say that Muslims did it .. anything bad muslims do it ?! .. i hope That fire will not happen again
Why not organize a water dump or a foam dump from a helicopter or airplane..  those fire fighters look like they have garden hoses
Now that Cathedral will be replaced with a Mosque...
I think it should keep burning as it is this is amazing, what a spectacle!!! Wonderful
That's what you get with the islamic invasion,
I truly think it was an accident during renovations but IAM happy I wasn't the only one who kept getting Hunchback of Notre Dame images!
Cool video!
Holler snackbar?
one spark. trapped gas from decay. poof. fire is unforgiving. am so upset. dang.
Another culturally enriched situation
Second most iconic structure of Paris is gone....
Peasants, lords, kings and priests have touched the walls of that cathedral for centuries. Those walls are now utterly destroyed. Rebuilding it with new engineers will simply not bring back the old glory
WAW 😂😂
the police have better water cannons than firemen but they only use those on the Yellow Vest protesters. Priorities....
I have been inside this cathedral. And now it's destroyed. It's like a part of my history got gutted. 🙁🙁🙁
😊😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10th Christian Church set ablaze since Jan 5 2019.
Do the cowardly French need the the U.S. to come rescue them again?
Ihr seit beschämend mir fällt nichts anderes dazu ein überall auf der Welt sterben Menschen Chaos wo Mann nur hin guckt und eure Kommentare dazu nichts aber eine Gebäude brennt und ihr weint fast eure Herzen sind Tod Schamhaft traurig sehr traurig 😢
Rachael MadCow blame Trump yet?
Wish many pedofiles burned alive there.
Trump: I thought this was located in Indiana?
All  because they would not talk about the mouth's long protest
Rebuild the entire cathedral. This is the work of the devil and narrated by CNN and MSNBC. The devil's hands.
Two years ago I visited this cathedral. By then also it was in the midst of security.
How did this place catch on fire in the first place?!
Where is the hunchback gonna live now?
who do you think is responsible for this?
Is Quasimodo ok?
Was this another Trump Turd firebug gone crazy?
Disneys had predicted this fire through the movie the HunchBack of Notre Dame . The death of Lord Frollo plunging into the fire pit.
probably some stupid welder and his gas tank......there were already renovations going on!
ushering in the Islamic state of the west
No Need to waste money traveling to France anymore.
Massive timber construction, tons of stain, paints... Just wow, huge historical loss.
I will never forget this sad day.
One hour for the fire Dept to arrive! This was a set up by the evil of the left and anti-Christians. MSNBC loves it.
Not religious in any way but it's really sad from a history standpoint.
if we Germans can rebuild a freaking church from rubble they can rebuild this
EU loving Macron is a Curse on France!
I'm sure it's just an "accident" .. right before Easter...
Frollo came back for revenge.
Paris and France  is a Muslim city country now anyway.
The Muslims did this there will be a war
My Muslim friends are friends of peace, and they would never laugh at what has happened. Shame to see anyone taking pleasure in this situation. 
This is devastating, but as my Catholic Church has stayed afloat for millenia, this fire will only bring us closer together in prayer as we begin our Holy Week. Hope noone is hurt physically due to this fire. 
a historical sight.. oh god this is tragic.
Have friends that live there, live chatting with them right now as I write this. They all think the same thing, Holy week for Christians leading up to Easter Sunday with numerous attacks over the past 18 months against Christian houses of worship but no mention of Terrorism. So I asked them if they thought that this is a Terrorist act and they said of course it is. When I asked them why is it not all over the media, they simply responded, the media will not report on it due to fear of retaliation against other religious groups. When asked what other Religious groups they are discussing, they said really Jerry, you need to ask that. Should be interesting to see what transpires over the next day or so and see what the actual cause is. Very sad all the way around : (
https://www.gofundme.com/NorteDameCathedral
The police have put out an APB on Quasimodo.
its not a fire its terrorism
This is terrible why they dont use helikopters???
I am sure MSNBC and Rachel Maddog will try to blame this on Trump and then tie it to the Russia investigation.
I guess the facade will survive but the rest ?
Three black churches in Louisiana burnt down last week and the fires was set by the son of the local sheriff. We have been in grief for the destruction of our houses of Prayer. Please pray for us also.
I bet the Russians did this
I know quite logically that many of the world's great structures will be underwater and otherwise destroyed in just a few decades, but watching the flames destroy this feat of mankind, built for the greater glory, is truly a gut wrenching moment.
Cultural enrichment!
Me thinks "some people did something" maybe?
Have the French surrendered to it yet?
The perfect metaphor for France right now.
Quasimodo is sick and tired of being locked in the tower by Lord Frollo
Ilhan Omar and Jussie Smollett said they seen 2 white guys, wearing red hats yelling, "this is maga country" running away from Notre Dame right when the fire began.
Revelation 18:8 For this reason her plagues will come in a single day,
    death and mourning and famine,
and she will be burned up with fire;
    for mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.”
9 And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning. 10 They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say,

“Alas! Alas! You great city,
    you mighty city, Babylon!
For in a single hour your judgment has come.”
I wonder where EU and France was when 100s of Serbian Monasteries and Churches were burned by Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija, Monasteries and Churches who were older than Notre Dame itself. I suppose Christian Europe failed to do anything about it, in other words Europe pushed God out of its courtyard a long time ago and this is just a sign...Really sad nevertheless.
Dammit Judge Claude Frollo. Why did you sang Hellfire again?
Hopefully macron does the right thing and build a mosque there so that France's ostracized migrant community can finally have some semblance of contributing to french culture. The muslim french community deserve that and more.
I doubt it can be repaired.. The structural damage must be huge. To rebuild it would take stonecutters that have long since died along with there secrets. The cost would be staggering and make take a decade if even attempted. It would be easier to replace the Eiffel tower than this old stone structure. I doubt even the Free Masons have people to recreate this masterpiece. Very sorry for the French people to lose a part of there soul...The world has lost an Icon..................
I bet is was a red-hatted Trump MAGAt. They burn churches here in America all the time.
I hear they will rebuild it as a Mosque
I'm surprised MSNBC hasn't said that Trump was spotted running from the building.
'Accident' 🤡🌎
beautiful
MSNBC, Where's Trump's taxes? Can you find out and let the American people know?
Notre Dame got the same sprinkler system as trump tower
Build a Mosque after it burned down.  This is the god's will.
Ahh the globalust banking halfwits are at it again. Will they ever stop? Probably not... ordo ab chaom.  
Gloabalist bankers to the judiciary: 'Let the hordes run riot' 💀
Well, well, well, I wonder who could be responsible for this, HMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Where are the firefighters?
It looks like a factory with the smoke coming out from the roof. Europe has been been built on the blood of others but Really sad to see something of historical importance getting destroyed!
the spirit of all the deceased orphaned children molested by the spiritual hands that's supposed to love them.
No helicopter water drops like they do in forest fires?
That’s the shot that tells you it’s a planned attack. They’ll get thousands of police on a mosque shooting in NZ but zero response is just ‘natural’ when it comes to burning cultural landmarks of Christendom Europa. 
This is a declaration of war
Quasimodo just had enough
This is contributing to global warming!!!!😂🤣😃😄😆
criminal macron will accuse the gilets jaunes......
like hitler accused the communists for the chancellery fire
Rats-childs style operation to deflect from the yellow vests revolt
Score more points for cultural enrichment. Paris truly has turned in to a sh!thole due to Emmanuel Macron, the EU, and globalist policies.
MSNBC..... Where's "Morning Joe"   his opinion will really matter ?!?!?!   Just like his "story" about his intern.....  com'on Joe what's your prognosis.... inside job ?
🖕🏻🇫🇷🖕🏻🇫🇷🖕🏻🇫🇷🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻😂
I guess a Mosque will replace it.
When NATO countries were bombing the ancient Serbian churches in Kosovo in 1999, the Western 
people were rejoicing. Now, when God is punishing the French for their crimes against the Serbs, 
the Serbian people are praying and expressing  their sincere sorrows for the loss of this church
which is as old as the Serbian churches deliberately destroyed in 1999.
The U.S. will blame Iran and invade on behalf of France.. Worked with the world trade centers...
This is God's judgment.

The Roman Catholic Church is of the devil.

They bow down to worship and pray to Mary who is still dead.

Jesus is the only way to the Father.

Yet the Roman Catholic church calls Jesus a liar when he said:


6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

John 14:6


It is also written:


5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

1 Timothy 2:5-6


Roman Catholics need to stop bowing down to worship and pray to Mary because she is dead and cannot hear you.

Even Mary needed a savior because Jesus was the only one who was without sin.

That is the truth in love.
Rumor has it that Pope Francis ordered his minions to set the fire in order to further destroy anything "traditional."
rip the hunchback
You had one job France...
You can donate via cash app at $notredamefund
All in God’s plan they said.
Perhaps it is time to (re)watch Disneys The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Serves president Macron right for his attitude to Mrs May during Brexit, justice served French Frogs 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Unionized workers?
Probably an incendiary device with a delayed timer left by General Dietrich Von Choltitz
karma
Hey MSNBC, why aren't you streaming President Trump's roundtable on economic reform?  Are you afraid of your viewers finding out the truth?
yellow vest did it ?
This is the first relevant and #RealNews story that MSNPC has reported in 2 & 1/2 years.  Bravo!
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the .1 Peter 4:17
Hellfire from Frollo
the irony..
This is so Montreal has the biggest notre Dame now!!
This is what is happening in this world all holyness being engulfed in flames, well never be able to create something like that ever again.
It will collapse.
It's called Jewish lightning.
Wheres your God now?
Heh
MSNBC-  "Fire Engulfs Notre Dame Cathedral....Trump Responsible."
Out with the old in with the new, great Holy Week teaching actually
French President Macron scheduled this fire to destroy history and merge France to globalism.
God is sending a message to Europe? They have turned away from God with secularism
why? the orange color of the Smoke biological weapon?
maybe it was all the candles
No one to blame other then the  Liberal minded French people
They voted for their Savior
i see NO Hoses.... why the delay!
Trump: I hope the Hunchback got out OK.
Maybe it’s a sign
This makes me sick. Glad I got to see Notre Dame years ago. Are there not firefighting helicopters in France that can spot drop water and chemicals on fires like we have in America? Airplane firefighting wouldn’t be acceptable in downtown Paris. Does it even matter? What a tragedy. ☹️
The Illuminati did it again...
Symbolic of France’s national suicide
Im sure MUSLIMS had absolutely nothing to do with it!!💁‍♂️
This is the 9-11 of art history.
Don’t worry ! The churche will be raplaced with a beautiful mosque 😍☪️☪️☪️!!! La ilaha illallah
I hope is not the religion of peace responsible for this.  Very sad.
Awwww did your make believe God not save your house house of self
May be DEW HAARP fckg deep state ! time to have em in GITMO!!!
Globalist burned this great piece of french history to punish the french people /gilets jaunes for their impudence against the onslaught of eu/globalist agenda .dont let this stop you french brothers viva les gilets jaunes
Norte Dame survived the Nazis and World War II. But it couldn't survive the enemy of France, Macron!!!
Let me guess fox news did it
ATTENTION PEOPLE: APRIL 15TH IS THE DAY THE OCCULT ARE DOING SACRIFICE BY FIRE!!! DEVIL WORSHIP!!
The radical left.
Never fear, President Dumfuk J Alzheimer is now a fire fighting expert and has offered his advice to the French authorities.
I never watch msnbc and I’m glad I didn’t see any commercials. 
The fact that they didn’t have an ARMY of “fire watchers” working all three shifts is beyond me.
Arson
So now the yellow-wests can begin doing something positive for a change... cleanup & rebuild
ISLAM
Isnt anyone annoyed by the same clip so badly cut being played on repeat there for almost 6 minutes straight
I have no sad feelings for anything Roman Catholic burning!
The Fire God killed the zombie god in Paris.
Nothing to see here folks, just making room for a Minaret..... move along.
AOC thinks its really cool.
Looks like some people did something
How come that the fire spreads so fast???? How is it possible  if it started from some unique location??? It would have been localized and put down then, am I right? All this sounds very strange to me.
Islam religion of Peace? 🔥
BREAKING NEWS! rachel maddow confidential source confirms trump stsrted fire that destroyed notre dame in paris. democrats launch full investigation.
The NBC News livestream had an Encyclopedia Britannica article about the September 11th attacked beneath the video.
R. I. P Quasimodo
The house of self righteous self-serving selfish Christians burning down I guess it is going to be a good day.
Very interesting timing....
Disney/CIA/Mossad predicted this arson crime in their evil movie "THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME."
Government is broken. Purification by fire!!! Prepare!
Poutine a fait ça!
Its not burning up as fast as the United States is with old tinyhands at the helm. if only we could get the ratpublicans to "abandon ship"
Free Assange or more stuff will magically catch on fire!  Assange 2020!!!!
Religion of peace?
Job inside ...    no sign of French fire brigade  in the air   ... planes or  helicopters ?     Is that  think for the Easter  time ?
Did a Muslim do it?
What does it matter anymore. Let it burn.
An ominous omen, of the future of europe.
Looks like that’s one less building children will be touched in
The revolution is beginning to happen! You are either for them or against them! FREE ASSANGE!!!
Don't y'all find it very ironic and symbolic that all these church fires happened back to back just before Easter? God is trying to warn y'all to not celebrate Easter. Celebrate passover, and stay away from these false churches. They are of the devil.
This is a strong blow on Western civilization. Unimaginable! Straight into the heart.... and worse than 9/11....
Terrorists
Let me guess, thoughts and prayers... This is God's work, everything is and has a purpose. As terrible as this seems, it is retribution for all the child molestations that have gone unpunished.
where is the air water for a plane  & helicopter ? ??????? where are all teh fire fighter fighters ????
If it's built into a mosque, its gonna look horrible.
Okay, I will do the Crazy Religious Nut Comment:   "God is punishing them...."
god is great allahu akbar
If they had raked first, they could have prevented this terrible fire.
Notre Dam burning! France burning! Europe Burning!
you guys should put "notre dame cathedral " in google translate in arabic and find a news reporting in arabic on youtube..find the most views and google translate the comments from muslims on this devastating event. they are praising the fire. while we are sad of this historical religious monument. muslims are saying " God is greatest", " O Allah, pour your anger on the enemies of islam, which is more and more, and burn them with the will of Allah", "Something joyful, I called God to burn France because of the looting of the gas of Algeria for free, will burn all, God willing" "Oh God, more than these fires in France", "Oh, traitors, my Lord, avenge you, Yaaklab's agents, and you have taken refuge in the infidels, and you have not suffered from our brothers in Palestine. Praise be to Allah, they burned, and God willing, the studio is burning. 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼 Long live Palestine"..this should give u guys an idea...look it up yourselves. i didnt have to dig for these comments,,, they were one after the other.  here is where i got the comments 
The Russians Did It ?? So Sad All The Lost History
The sense of loss is widespread for this historical building.  Can't help thinking of the women of wealth, knowledge and property the church burned to death to confiscate their lands and money under the ruse of religion.  Maybe the eradication of such monuments has an upside for the mind of future generations.  Some losses make way for better things to replace them.  The value and importance of the whole building does not come close to that of even one of the women who were tortured and burned to death, so let's keep this in perspective.  Karma?


That said, I hope all in proximity are safe and sound.
Tragedy?, huh?. Calm down Steph, it's only an old historical building. A tragedy is if people were burnt alive in the building(cathedral). A building can be rebuilt, repaired or replaced. A human life lost to tragedy, cannot be rebuilt, repaired or replaced.
The greed & negligence of catholic church for decades, has led to this catastrophe ... a loss of cultural history that far exceeds just the catholic church.
