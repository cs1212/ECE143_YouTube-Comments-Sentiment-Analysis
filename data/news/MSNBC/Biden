BREAKING NEWS : Nobody cares or wants Joe Biden gasp
Wow, super late and predictable.
Fk no! No more old career politicians!
Never forget that even with the benefit of hindsight, Biden gave George W. Bush a Liberty Medal just last year(2018) for bringing so much "freedom" to the world. He also voted for the war in Iraq and helped author The Patriot Act. He was also extremely hostile to Anita Hill and was chairman of the committee she testified before. So when he laments how she was treated, he's the one who treated her that way.
Really?  From the way the media has framed it Joe Biden has been in the race since January.
I will be donating to Bernie Sanders on Thursday then! Bernie2020!!
Not voting for Biden.
YANG2020
Yangang where you at
Sorry Joe, if I am going to vote for an old guy, I'll vote for Bernie.
Biden has 0% chance of being president.
That‚Äôs like holding a press conference to announce that we‚Äôre going to announce ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A BOY!‚Äù in a few days! How very anti climatic even for a creep like Joey
I'm a Democrat and have been for 30 years and Biden will not get my vote.
He is to coservative and will not get my vote.
If he gets the nomination Dems will loose.
Sorry Joe it's to late for you to run and win.

Biden your memes were funny but BERNIE 2020!!
I guess a candidate that would actually do something about the ramped corruption that had been on display for the last two years would be asking too much?

Uncle President doesn't have a good ring to it
It sounds like Biden is not too enthusiastic about this.
Is he being pressured into this by the DNC?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sniffer.‚Äù
Creepy Joe is going to save us from Trump?
If Biden isn't a very strong "yes" on impeachment, he might as well not bother to run
Joe, do it!
Why not? If you don't run, you won't know whether you could win or not. As far as I'm concerned, we should have a president who is already knowledgeable in the field of foreign affairs as well as domestic. Someone with honor and integrity and has a working knowledge of civics, the law, government, history and the Constitution of the United States of America. We have to stop this hyper partisanship and just vote for the BEST candidate of our choice. üåπ
Lol..Creepy uncle Joe has as much chance as CPL had.
LOLOLOLOL
Schmo Bye-Done
creepy , zombie joe!
Is this an announcement for the announcement?
He will TOUCH the lives of millions!! Hahaha
He will not perform well in the televised debates. His ideas are way too old school.
Creepy Uncle Joe Biden
He will legalise groping.  Well at least in the White House
The public is being denied access to about 2,000 boxes of records from 
Joe Biden‚Äôs Senate career -- information that spans more than three 
decades.



The University of Delaware, where the Biden archive is stored, says the 
records might not be available until late 2019, possibly even later.
Just a reminder that not only did Joe Biden support the invasion of Iraq in 2003, he also was a big part of the War on Drugs.
Yes, Yes, Yes! We have another easy chance for 2020! Trump 2020!!
My prediction is once he announces his poll numbers will immediately begin to drop. No matter how much money he raises from big donors and Wall Street it will never make him likable or relatable to every day voters.  Nobody wants to hear him defend billionaires, nobody wants to hear him defend Republicans. Statements like that are evidence that he's not gonna do anything to upset those people.   He has no grassroots support, no support among the base. He's gonna make excuses for the status quo and that's it. The only people who like him are party elites, media elites and older moderate Democrats who think that it's still the 1990s.
Big Deal , My pet dog announced it was running for President - and Spot is polling better than Biden .
Creepy uncle Joe is in
Say No to Joe!
He's really going to get in touch with voters. Get his hands in there if you know what I'm saying. Is presidential run is going to leave a lot of people touched.
he missed his chance in 2016.  will be too old.  too bad bernie is just as old. bernie got screwed by the dnc and hillarites
Joe...go home!
Let the race begin.
steve miller song :     I'm a creeper and a peeper a groper and  poke....r get my jollies on the run...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. some people call a weirdo some people call insane  don't you worry don't worry mama the right wing I'll blame .. grope you grope grope you baby all of the time..             cause I'm a creeper and a poker  and a underage stroker  someday I'll do some time
Love Joe!
Please no 
I‚Äôll vote tRump if he‚Äôs the dem candidate 
I want new ideas not old  guard
Bernie or we give trump 4 more disastrous years
Biden is a Clinton puppet.   We don‚Äôt want or need these deep state swamp creatures anymore.   They promote fear and war.   

Just say no to Joe.
Bernie 2020
Bernie 2020
So we have had the hot diarrhea of presedent for two years, I guess that's why they think they can win us over with the plain oatmeal of candidates
what bout metoo?
The last time around, Joe Biden said he wasn't going to run because he had to put his family first (meaning not America first). That's fine. Let him be the president of his family, but not of the United States of America.
Another thing: He's 76 year old, too old to run for even the dog catcher in my town, let alone for the POTUS. Let Bernie duke it out with Trump, and may the best man for the country win.
Blah blah blah blah creepy Biden 100% corporatist. we know your history next.
NO MORE PEDOPHILES IN DC!!!
I literally don‚Äôt know 1 person who wants biden to win.  Not 1.  Except for every pundit on msnbc
Joe Biden/Al Franken HANDS ACROSS AMERICA  MAKE GROPING GREAT AGAIN 2020
the issue is the 1994 crime Bill put that video up and he needs to answer for every single thing he said!! My people go look at that video make it very public! Called Joe Biden tough on crime bill 1994, tell us who and what he meant!!?? Keep in mind whites did same if not worse, they got off we are still locked up!
Wall Street Biden= Trump 2020 re election victory.
NOBODY 2020
wait Joe Biden hasn't announce his candidacy yet?  Sigh ppl keep sticking his name in polls.
Gropin' Joe in 2020?
Fkn nick cannon is to blame for this smh
We're saved
Why muddy someone else run, like ummmmm Bernie
Can this guy just go away, already?
Creepy Uncle Joe. .. nasty
Don't do it, Joe
Just. Don't.
No thanks.
Thats wall built 2020!! Trumps making America great
It‚Äôs about time
lol this is not news it's like, speculation about speculation
His time came and went. He won‚Äôt be able to counter Bernie with his middle way neoliberalism without attacking him with right-wing talking points.
Despite what the media might think, no one will vote for Joe, again.  Especially after two months of waiting for an announcement?  Talk about gutless.
No more molesters!
Another Hillary-Net Terminator Robot ? ... Again ? ...
Creepy Joe!
Supporting Bernie. Not interested in Biden.
Corporate guy
No country for old men
Oh c'mon they got like 20 ppl running already....
Half truths Joe.... if you are going to quote Trump give the full quote.
No way! That's awesome! Bout to take they house back!
Looking forward to Bernie trouncing Biden.
The first time biden ran for president was in 1980.
Bad idea.
Bernie. Mayor Pete .. 2020
This guy shouldn't even be in the race. I don't care if he is best buds with Obama, Bernie is getting my vote even if I have to write him in!!
but can PEDO Joe pass the sniff test?
More like corporate cork sucker
Nope.
He has no chance against Trump.
Dont bother joe
If it came from Andrea Mitchell‚Äôs broadcast I believe it. Don‚Äôt prove me wrong Joe Biden.
No chance
No Joe Biden, do not run the presidency race.  You are robbing Bernie chances of becoming one!
In the primary, I‚Äôm voting for Bernie. And if Biden wins, I‚Äôll be voting Green Party.
This is great news for Republicans.
anybody is better than the orange imbecile
Whoopdeedoo. üôÑ I better stop rolling my eyes over this or they'll get stuck! Thank you, establishment Dems.
I wish my democratic brother would not fight against each other.
Uncle kiddie fiddler Joe Biden.
Lame.
To old !!
creepy joe.
IDK why he would announce he has enough luggage to drag down the Democrats party..please don't announce....
He's running as a republican guys relax
He'll be too old(78)if elected.
Your time has passed. It‚Äôs time to step aside and let younger minds step in while in their prime.
Bernie can't win this election even worst Pete ( they need Black n Hispanic votes) that is very simple. Is  Joe Biden vs  Kamara Harris wild card Ms Warren.
Mayor Pete has my support.. We need new blood. Biden has made too many mistakes that were detrimental to the black community. #NoBiden #NoBernie
Know what's ballsed-up his chance? His idiotic fart-assing around toying with an announcement like any other machine drone donorbot politician driven by focus groups and political consultants without a true spine or set of beliefs. Biden's are whatever the largest DNC donors tell him they are.
He doesn't have a goddamned chance. It's all downhill for his bland establishment mush from now forward.
Kamela Haris said if she gets elected president she will impeach Trump. very smart for a democrat.
Aggressive progressive
Nooooo!!!!
Bernie
WHY
Expect Hilary to run as soon as Biden throws in his hat.
Please don't
Biden set to announce his offical run for president this Christmas.
Biden has just too much baggage.   1)  His "affection" for young women/girls is creepy.  2)  His brain is unreliable.  Research his surgeries.  3)  He's the Bush Mafia's mule.  That's why he was picked for VP and that's why they want him now.
I don't like creepy pedos or extremists, Trump 2020!
Kanye West for President 2020
Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders!
whoever grabs John Kerry as their VP wins the game
Here's my thoughts on the DNC plan this time around.... With Massive Voter Fraud, like they did to Bernie, the DNC makes sure Biden is the candidate. He picks Hillary as his running mate. With even more Massive Voter Fraud than last time they finally steal the election. Biden has a Fort Marcy Park Moment and Hillary is now President for Life. BTW, Bill Clinton showed us Polls will tell you whatever you pay them to tell you.
And now the demographic split. Older Democrats seem to favor Biden and younger Bernie
Woohooo Donnie he's coming to get ya. Oh I can't wait to see them in debates.. Donnie your gonna be reduced to a 5th grader. Even if you don't get the nomination the spectacle of watching you oblirate Donnie in debates is mouthwatering.
LOL
I am not glad about this! Bernie Sanders is too old. and so is Biden.  This country requires a new direction.
Please, no...
I'm for Bernie for President in 2029.
Msnbc and the beltway corporate Wall Street media establishment nutting in their pants with Biden, Mayor Pete, and Beto.
Who cares.
He called gays ‚Äúsecurity risks.‚Äù 

Former vice president Joe Biden once told a group of constituents in Delaware he viewed homosexuals working for the federal government as ‚Äúsecurity risks,‚Äù according to an archived local news.
The media is really pushing for Joe Biden awfully hard.
Let's end the 'Joe Biden for president' delusion right now
The Clintons are a crime syndicate. Obama was in on it... He knew all about it.... and Comey was a crook. CNN's ratings are now lower than the Food Channel.
Bang
No chance
Joe Biden shouldn't bother. Kamala Harris is much better.
My first question for Mr. Hands....  I want accountability for the money Obama gave you for curing cancer..  How is that going?
LOL!
Biden is first in the polls by 27%.  However that can change.
Please don't run if anything just go home what's this democratic candidate # 178, I lost count after the Mueller report I mean the Barr redacted report
Wow what a great thought I just had I'm going to announce I'm going to run for president then I can raise money to pay my credit cards
Americans people do not care ,  he is done before before announce Pres run .
Fake News
WHO WANTS TO VOTE FOR A CHILD GROPPER AND MOLESTER...
Wow!!! It's like living in 2007, only in 2019! I am soooooooo excited. Was the sarcasm thick enough?
WANT OBAMA TO RUN AGAIN NOT BIDEN
Uncle Joe, I'm with you bro
Give me a break ! !
Before announcing Biden will give a "touchy" statement.
Well Joe, against my advice , on every site I saw you on , to keep yourself above the fray , I wish you luck. Obama said you are a good man.
also its fun to see all the bernie boys out now... last time they were crying about it being hillary's turn.  suddenly its not so bad now that its their guys turn.
what a JOKE , sniff and squeeze ugly JOE is BACK , RUN!
No.
Is only one man out there and is Bernie Sanders. Period
TIME TO STORM WASHINGTON BY THE MILLIONS AND SHOW EM WHAT A REAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LOOKS LIKE!
Biden can not win against Trump. The reason is that to win he has to take the bully pulpit from Trump. Silent Trump, I can see Biden doing that.
Who cares?
üá∫üá∏‚ù§SANDERS/WARREN 2020/ #46‚ù§üá∫üá∏
He is too out of touch with younger voters... His era of politician is over and Bernie is our future.
Here‚Äôs a quote from Joe Biden on millennials. 

‚ÄúThe younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break. No, no, I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here‚Äôs the deal guys, we decided we were gonna change the world. And we did. We did. We finished the civil rights movement in the first stage. The women‚Äôs movement came to be. So my message is, get involved. There‚Äôs no place to hide. You can go and you can make all the money in the world, but you can't build a wall high enough to keep the pollution out. You can't live where‚Äîyou can't not be diminished when your sister can't marry the man or woman, or the woman she loves. You can't‚Äîwhen you have a good friend being profiled, you can't escape this stuff. And so, there's an old expression my philosophy professor would always use from Plato, 'The penalty people face for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.' It's wide open. Go out and change it."

Talk about DOA.
And now a 1973 newspaper article surfaces in which Joe Biden says that homosexuals working for the government are a "security risk". Hes not going to win anything. He can spend his golden years sniffing the hair of women who desperately want to get away from him. And now all the democrats have to rely on is crazy Uncle Bernie and his I am a millionaire but I want you to depend on the government for everything type of socialism.
We don‚Äôt want this mf
Meh
While Biden has name recognition and if it came down to it, I'd cast my popular vote for him, but I hear that he's not for marijuana legalization across the board, and that, if true, is one of the things I'd hold against him. For me, he must change his mind on that matter, otherwise I might not even vote at all in the so called 2020 presidential election, knowing that the president of the üá∫üá∏ in not elected by the popular vote...am still ambivalent on all the other Dem candidates; the gender and race of the candidate is of no factor to me, even though I know that it's a white-male dominated system of things. If the congress, now under democratic majority, don't stand against the current corruprion and perversion of justice and lies spewing out  of the republican control Senate and WH, then I say we should get our just desserts.
Great leaders are never afraid to stand and fight for justice and truth, even when confronted by rich and powerful men of the world!!!
Andrew Yang needs to be the next president he would do the most to change America for the best its not about money it‚Äôs about people‚Äôs lives and there health I feel like some people out there would rather make money then save someone‚Äôs life
Who cares
Sleepy Joe needs a nap he looks tired talking about how he was the vp of Obama. The muslium who flew 580 billion to Iran and passed the worst concept of Healthcare. Trump 2020
Biden is great. He should have run four years ago. Now it's too late. Give room to new talent, Joe.
Joe touch biden: if I am your president I will keep your kids safe, hug every individual i encounter, I will make sure everyone smells good, I will keep your children's hair comb with my hand comb. I am creepy uncle Joe and I APPROVED this message..
Trump is the 3rd worst president in US history.
That's awesome I'm glad that old sack of s*** is running the Democrats will be eating him alive he'll be eating them alive there should be some very juicy s*** coming out about him I mean swimming in nude in front of female FBI agents that is proven that is a fact that you did that kind of s*** and is funneling and touching and yeah he's a creep what's the weather rest of the Democrats it'll be a fun show buckle up
Seems like a vanity presidential campaign for the old school democrats...just thinking how much money he‚Äôs going to waste on this makes me cringe.
here comes shotgun Joe biden quote manufacturing will never return to the usa.
who cares
Hes really affectionate with kids. Totally not creepy.
Mr. Vice President  !!! My vote will be for you.
Born Nov. 20, 1942, Biden will be 78 in 2020. During his first year in law school, he was accused of having plagiarized five of 15 pages of a law review article. Biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation, and was permitted to retake the course after receiving an "F", which was later dropped from his record. Once again in 1987, further plagiarism accusations emerged. After graduating law school and becoming an attorney he started a small law practice. He didn't care for it very much because the practice of criminal law didn't pay well. Slick-tongued and capable of cheating and justifying his transgressions, Biden had all the prerequisites of becoming a consummate member of the  D.C swamp where he could flourish and get in on all the perks. So, that's where he set his sites. At the age of 30 he went to where the REAL money was, Washington D.C., having won a senatorial seat in the U.S. Congress. He has NEVER left. Why would he? After all, he finally found his POT OF GOLD!
I hate the entitlement that comes with this dragging-on announcement. And I really like Joe Biden. But candidates have been out there, busting their butts for months, showing the work they‚Äôre willing to put in.
Looks like Bernie supporters will be voting for Trump
Dont vote for a women creeper. Kissing on the mouth
Does he have nothing else better to do?
We don't want more cooperate Dems.
A little to late. I lost interest in him.
B00!!
Can he get Obama as a vice president
Stupid polls put him no.1
We don't need another insider Democrat as president, We need Bernie ! Bernie is the champion of the working class and has a track record to back it up .
Hillary's male clone is running. Oh goody.
I think I've watched videos for the last two months now, that all told me that Biden will announce his candidacy "next week"...
MSNBC is going to have to start buying subscribers like CNN and TYT does.
Why isnt there someone who isnt a child
I‚Äôm a Trump supporter and will donate to Bernie he is a gift to conservatives. He and Biden both!
Go away Biden we don‚Äôt want you we want Bernie
Sorry Joe. It‚Äôs a no for me dude.  You had your chance and we ended up with Hillary which led to DTüò°
Great I'll endorse anyone but another Republican at this point. I don't care whether its Bernie or Biden...heck better yet maybe we should put them both inüòÄ..they say 2 heads are better than (1-dum Trump)üòÇüòÇüòÇ
But Joe's a cis gendered white male....
How's those Blue Cross donors?
Biden/Franken 2020.
"We're just Friendly"
Biden will get spanked worse than Hillary did if he runs in 2020 against Trump.
Drama queen Joe is a coward. He waits and whines and complains while everyone else is running. He is toast before he starts. Bye Creeper Joe
I do like Joe, and was feeling positive about him running, but I have to be honest, I am way more on board with Mayor Pete any this stage. He is more than half Joe's age and is a more exciting prospect in my opinion.
GREAT IDEA    MSNBC   Biden  is our man !!!!!!!!!!!!
Why now and not after Obama's run ended? Hillary was a better choice at the time? Joe wasn't interested at the time? Like I just feel this choice is out of touch with what's going on in the country now. Biden missed his chance by not running in 2016.
Establishment Democrats need not apply!
geez might as well throw in Hillary, more corporate sell outs.
Biden??  You mean more of the Obama/Clinton/Deep State crime ring?
Is it too late for Bernie to run as an independent? (Because the DNC just preemptively chose their candidate. Again.)
Biden waited too long to announce; people are tired of the old Democratic guard that never seems to inspire people, and wants to retain the status quo while raking in the corporate cash. Hard pass.
They all need to stand down & make sure #Bernie2020 beats Trump! Of course, they won't because they want to keep the status quo!!! Keep it Dems, and we'll end up with Trump again!
Nobody cares.
What a waste of time and resources, what's the point, he's irrelevant!!
Elizabeth Warren, the first female commander and chief!!! You have my Vote üåû

And Nimitz Class
Might as well have Hillary run again.üòí
Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill that lead to mass incarceration and failed to do his job in regard to corroborating the testimony of Anita Hill.  Creepy uncle Joe is so vengeful about the truth coming out that he's willing to let Trump be re-elected.
Bought and sold by corporate money ..him and obama
NO NO NO
Biden is boring.
Of course Biden will run, the Establishment Democrats are desperate to lose, every time they come close they do what the donors say and not the Base
Good bye, Joe.
I hope, very sincerely.
Eh..........
DOA. No one cares. Centrists are desperate.
Unless Biden attacks Trump with everything he's got and on every subject from A to Z, he will lose.
Can't wait to watch him crash and burn.
Joe "Pervy" Biden.
I'm looking forward to a president who doesn't tweet his crazy thoughts all the time!
Trump made humongous Tax Cuts for the Super-Rich and now plans to pay for it by taking the money from Social Security and Medicare.   Screw him and the GOP.
clinton may as well run too.
I like you Joe but this ain't it brotha! New blood is needed. anybody  under 50 has my vote!
Go Joe!!!
Why is speculation now breaking news?
ü§¢
YES!!! Creepy Uncle Joe.  The memes are ready to fire.
Too late Joe, go home.
I'm sick of this cat-and-mouse by Joe Biden. Get in or stay out.
Vomit. Same old same old.
No thanks, Mr. Biden. Go, Bernie Sanders!
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter...He‚Äôs still going to loose!
Bernie has no chance... the socialist thing won't work. I guess creepy uncle joe is the guy.
Too late for Biden, he wouldn't even live half way through a term.
Meh.  I think he's missed the window.  I'm going with Mayor Pete.
We'd vote for Richard Gere's gerbil over Trump at this point!
Go Joe Go. Just tell the orange toad that you enlisted in the armed forces. Them ask him, if the bone spurs hurt during the weekend golf rounds. Drop the mic
Biden hasn't had an original idea...SINCE NEVER! He's like 5G,who ever said we wanted it~
Biden/Sanders 2020
He will not win
The Internet will halt with Creepy Biden memes and videos.
Good luck, Biden. You're currently 12 points behind Bernie in the latest polls. BERNIE 2020
Joe YOU ARE A CORPORATIST,
NOT A PROGRESSIVE‚ÄºÔ∏è. 
So Congratulations, Joe, trump just won! 
Screw the Democratic Party Old Guard‚ÄºÔ∏è 
We are dead.
Whole to meaning to a touchy feelly president.

Trash
are u kidding me ... breaking news: biden TO announce,,, i think there are far more related breaking news, how about after he announces, u tell us guys... we dont need the clip per clip whateve this is...
#BidenObama2020
Waiting for Biden to smell Kamala's hair on debate night
Yayyyyyy!!!!
I'm voting for Bernie Sanders again
Bernie will crush Biden on the debate stage !!!!!
Love uncle Joe but i dont know how I feel about this
This should make all the senior citizens of the democratic party happy.
biden is the new Hillary.  the fix is in
Trump will easily defeat Joe. Is this the best the Democrats can do?
Ugh
What‚Äôs the matter Joe? Is this one of those ‚Äònever send a boy (Mayor Pete) in to do a man‚Äôs job‚Äô? He couldn‚Äôt close the deal so now it‚Äôs up to you? You couldn‚Äôt close the deal the last two times you ran, and the stakes have dramatically changed since then away from you, but have fun pretending like you still matter!
Blehahaha
Please Creepy Joe and commie Sanders don't have a chance , economy great, unemployment rate is a all time low,jobs coming back to USA, border protection for the Americans and not foreign countries self billionaire and not bought
Go joe 2020
We all want Biden to run as much as we all want gonorrhea.
#berniegivememyfreestuff
#MayorPete2020
If Joe Biden wins the nomination, I trust democrats will rally around and vote for him. Hey, I get it, we all want our favorite person to be the candidate. But I hope whoever the Democratic candidate is, we will all support her/him. I have little respect for the Bernie folks who voted for trump. And I was and remain a Bernie supporter.
Will Almighty, All Knowing Powerful God tell Joe Biden, "Depart from me you wicked (He-She knows a lot) man, I never know you-
Oh uncle Joe... Dude, don't do this.  We love ya' but I don't want you to be POTUS... 
BERNIE SANDER FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020!!!!
Creepy Joe and his propaganda arm of the DNC feigning as "news" MSNBC... I'll be voting Trump thanks.
The slimy RUSSIANS are all over this page trying to sabotage Biden. They are sooo transparent & easy to spot:
"I'm voting for Bernie"
" Go away, Joe"
"Creepy Joe Biden..." etc.

They attack Biden because they fear him the most; He poses the greatest threat to Trump's presidency.
Great. Number 19 that's a useless POS, more so with PEDO Joe.
#BookerCastro2020 or #CastroBooker2020
It feels like this is the fourth time he's announced his candidacy in this cycle, just given the amount of coverage he'd been getting as of a couple months ago. I think if he'd announced right at the same time as Elizabeth Warren, it might've caused more of a stir - but the public's moved on now, and it feels like he's that last kid to make it to the three legged race, only to find everybody else has already packed up and gone home, and it's started to rain.
We want Mayor Pete!
Creepy Joe is dead on arrival !
I think he shouldn't bother
Go joe ! Go
AWESOME
Vote for Mayor Pete who brings youthful enthusiasm and intelligence combined with pragmatism and listening to the presidential field.
Is anyone actually excited about this????
Why can't Biden stay away from politics, stay home and enjoy your good work and money.  You're  not going to win a tall not.
Joe Biden,  please lead your / our party.  Bring order to the herd.  If you and our party are not careful we will spend another 4 dangerous years with a reality show host leading our country (That is the nicest description I could come up with of our pres.....)  Be a leader not a runner in the herd.
Biden for 2020!
too old. too late. I don't not like him but it's time for somebody born in the 2nd half of the 20th century to be President.
The New Hampshire poll shows Bernie taking the lead at 30%. Biden is set at 15% and Buttigieg at 14%. 

Biden has made segregationist comments and has an issue with touching and getting too close to women without consent. He wrote and is proud of a crime bill that has scorched the black community. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Buttigieg has secret tapes that is trying to deep six. Racist cops were taped commenting against their black police chief. Buttigieg tried to fire / demoted the black police chief; he fired the whistleblower and fired the city attorney who did it so the investigation from arising. However, the racist police officers kept their jobs (yeah, big surprise).
Not only is he a Hillary and Obama FRIEND, He started out his campaign by starting a controversial War. I am so disappointed in Joe, he gave the oppinion he was carring, religious, and stood up for the American people. What does he do? Slams the President, We want a President for ACTION not MOUTH. We have had enough mouth in the last numerous years. We want to hear what you are going to do about helping our country, not what everyone else is doing wrong. If you want a chance for President stay away from talking about GUNS< TRUMP< AND DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM HILLARY AND OBAMA> STAND ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET NOT THE BACKS OF OTHERS.
Extremely interested in a Joe Biden presidency especially if Obama is his vice president!!!!!!!!
Good; I want him to explain his stated segregationist view; I want him to discuss his plans to cut Medicare and social security where he agreed with Paul Ryan; how he supported a Republican prior to the 2018 congressional election; his transgressions against women; and his love for the crime bill back in the 90‚Äôs that has scorned the black community. 

Oh yes; I want that conversation. I am looking forward to it with eager anticipation. 

I want his tax returns for 10 years. Make it so CNN.
OK. So what? Why should this guy, now, supplant any of the highly qualified people already in the race?
Trump 2020
And he hated blacks back in the days while Bernie was literally fighting for civil rights for black americans.....where was creepy joe than?
He reminds me of Jimmy Saville.
Biden is good on foreign policy, and putting Russian in check. Also, to reassure our allies that we won't  forget their sacrifice with us doing war time.
Creepy Biden wants to touch all the girls in Congress
üíñ Biden üíñ Yaaaaaaaaaasssss
Bernie Sanders.üëçüíØ
Bernie,Joe,Beto,or Kamala are my favorites
We're going to have another Hillary moment üí• But with Biden and Buttigieg ü§ü. Just let the younger generation have this one.
Don't do it Joe!  Your corruption involving your son will come to light.  If Dems don't stop you now, the Republicans sure will.
Any of you seen Andrea's new band called MSNBCannibalCorpse  lots of pics of her live on stage with them on BITCHUTE
Ol' Crime Bill Joe is in...time to vote Green Party
don't give that crook any money for the campaign such a waste of money
I bet he's looking up old Neil Kinnock speeches already.
No one likes creepy Uncle Joe anymore, lock up your daughters America...
Stop pushing him. He is a disgrace pervert. We don't need more corruption in the WH. Clean the swamp
He needn't bother... Nobody wants another creepy old man...
I bet he will keep the president salary not to say he's going to win but to say he needs more money for hair transplant
LET ME KNOW WHEN HE FINALLY DOES IT BECAUSE THE MEDIA HAS BEEN TALKIN' ABOUT IT FOR  A MONTH NOW OKAY & THEN AS SOON AS HE DOES THEY'LL SWITCH UP TO BRINGING UP ALL OF HIS PAST DIRT TO KEEP A STORY GOING LIKE THEY USUALLY DO & BASH HIM LIKE THEY'RE DOING BERNIE SANDERS NOW!!‚úåüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I don't think Biden really wants to be president. People are just pressuring him..
This is the best thing that could happen to Bernie 2020. Go on Joe, run, and further split the establishment vote between you, Harris and Buttigieg. Centrists and Softcore Republicans are a plenty this time around. Awesome news for Daddy Bernie. #Feelthebern
NON!  Say it ain't so Joe!  He should keep his beak out of it unless he's a supporter of Warren or Bernie!
Creepy Joe    
U1  Criminal   running to avoid indictment
God hes such a creep. Can everyone just stop already??? Too many people in the race. WE WANT BERNIE!!!
Lol pedophile Joe was supposed to announce weeks ago.  He won't even win the primary.  Too many creepy videos of him fondling little children
Breadline Bernie vs Pedo Joe. Pass the popcorn.
Eww racist creepy uncle joe enters the race
Joe Biden's back:  Hide your daughters especially if they're under age.
No one needs another Obama
GROSS....
Creepy joe in a race!!!! So I wonder how many more women he will touch up?
Good. No thanks to that skunk, Lucy Flores, who tried to bring him down.
That will be a total mistake on his part,,most women don‚Äôt believe his answers about his woman issue ,,also he had his day and missed it sorry also with Bernie üá∫üá∏. Time for new blood to lead our country üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
CHILD RAPISTS ARE POPULAR AT MSNBC
NO! We need a sweeping Sea Change. We need fresh, DEMOCRATIC BLOOD in our White House. We NEED Youth, Relatability, ‚Äúa today mindset‚Äù, We DO NOT need more Old Fogies & We DEFINITELY NEED a more 21st Century DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT not another retiree with same old, same old 20th century ideas & ideology. JUST NO TO BIDEN!
I voting for him
Who cares? Biden is a has-been person. And should remain as such.
None of these lefties have a chance of beating the Trump machine!
Mr Biden will get my vote in the primaries.
