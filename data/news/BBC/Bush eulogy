Wow the comments are sick. Don’t scroll down.
George Bush did a fine eulogy for his Dad.
No matter what you think of either of these men, it’s sad to watch a man bury his father.
Bill clinton looked suspiciously uncomfortable during the 'lady of the night' gag.
He will face justice In front of Must  God 
For his unjust things he did in his life
Goodbye George HW Bush! Thoughts and prayers to all of your family, friends and USA as a great nation 🎉
No idea why I was surprised to see dirty comments.

Faceless and nameless weakling.
Mr Bush Jr's Eulogy was so emotional. I edited it on my channel. Have a look please!
That was lovely from George W Bush to his father R.I.P.
watch ' EVERYTHING IS A RICH MAN'S TRICK'
Breaking news: former civil servant (i.e 41st POTUS) dies.
I love this guy ,he is godly
Who gives a fook lolll Awful person that deserves no respect.
Damn, I thought it was you not your dad 😑
Anyways.
I need subtitles for this video
Awww so beautifully written xx
WHATS IN THE BOX
A great tribute to his father.
I am a huge critic of George HW Bush, and remain so, but we are all human at the end. RIP.
One less globalists to worry about 😂
Whom among the comments  community is living a life free of sin ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
That eye-dagger he shot toward trump when speaking of integrity @ 10:43 could have cut diamonds. Well done.
Very fitting from George Bush Jnr
GOD BLESS HIS SOUL   OUR CONDOLENCES
iam crying wow    love that family
As a French, I have to admit that his eulogy was very emotional. We disagreed on Iraq war, but we always have been allied. God bless Bush father, what a great man he was. God bless the American nation, what a great nation you are. God bless our american brothers 🇺🇸 🇫🇷 ♥️♥️
Well done George W ♥️
a great speech and he couldnt have done this any better. just brilliant and lovely.
BTW I'm also here for How D Trump reacted, he didn't disappoint me.I love donald trump,he's on another level person.love you orangie.
I am drunk as fhck
YO KISSINGER... YOU'RE NEXT!
Must be nice having a rich daddy. Wish I had a speed boat 🙄
eulogy to a psychopath
Rest In Peace Mr. President.
This is so much more dignified and less political and enraged than McCain's funeral.......such a contrast.
Dont cry bush... he was 94..
you know how many Young people in Iraq died....
Great speech RIP.
Prescott Bush 👁️
A very well done eulogy from one fine man to another.
Bill Clinton is moving his mouth around like a goat :)))
George W. Bush will outlive his father if he lives until Christmas Day 2040.
Hell has a new resident
Why still he is alive ??
Life is vanity
I never thought Bush Jr. was a very good speaker, I mean ... we've all seen the press conference's with proof of this BUT he did his dad proud with that eulogy. It was beautiful. Despite your thoughts on politics at the moment, despite what you think Bush did or trump DOES, we could at least be respectful enough to let the man have a funeral. At the end of the day we are all human beings. We all have hearts. We all breathe the same air, we all die, we are on this planet together and it's sad to admit that we don't treat our fellow human beings with respect or love anymore. There's something to be said of being respectful enough to give your fellow human being and his mourning family time to grieve and time to remember their family member together. All that being said, he was also your president. I'm Canadian, so obviously I can't vote and its not my country, but what happens in the USA often has an impact on us whether it be big,small,bad or good, we are obviously closely tied with the USA and for good reason. I enjoy being in the states in Arizona for a month when our winter is the worst here in Alberta, so I like to keep up with politics. I'm big enough to say I didn't support a lot of things Bush did, but I can still say RIP when he passes on and it would be nice if a lot of you in the comments that are here just to hurt someone when they aren't here to defend himself, would do the same and move on. Their are millions of other videos hating on him, go do it there. This isn't the time or the place. Not ONE of you would be able to walk up to any of these people here and say to their face all the crap you guys have been spewing all over the comment section. Not one of you would say boo in person, not one of you, but being behind that screen allows you to voice opinions which is fine, but we are seeing more and more of these opinions that are straight hate speech. Be an adult, you don't need to hide behind your keyboard. If you wouldn't say something to the persons face, if you wouldn't say it in front of his family....don't say it online. Just a bit of a coward move in "my opinion". Honestly I don't want to make people mad, I just feel like I see this a lot, in so many different situations and I just wish we could at least try to be decent to our fellow human beings.
Anther criminal funeral
Good radiance.one less criminal
Rest in peace 💯🏴🏴🏴🏴
This is beautiful......just beautiful.......
You'll be in a coffin soon enough you war criminal.
A very touching, funny, and perfect speech. You honored your father, Mr. President. Our hearts broke with you and your family. He was a great President. And I'm proud to say he was my President. And he is indeed with you sister and Mom. Much love in this hard time to you and your family. And R.I P. Mr. President and thank you for all of your service to our great country!
What about the millions of innocent children souls which you slaughtered in Iraq?
Rest In Peace in the kingdom of God
小布什每次都很搞笑
The skull and bone very satanic world. If you dont repent hell is waiting all those sitting there.
Dead dead dead, this worldwide response of "good riddance" is what you have coming to you George W jnr!
Devil's
My graveside won't need 24/7 guards to stop ppl from defecating on my grave as the bushes do
that whas great
GHWB had the pleasure of being reunited in the afterlife with Robin and Barbara to look forward to, but eternity is a long time to be haunted by the ghosts of John and Robert.
Mr. President words very well spoken I will always respect the sitting president of the United States of America I respect you for your presidency I respect your father's I even respect the president that I don't agree with politically may you rest in peace
The crucified USA
I hope he joins his dad in hell soon!
i cried in the end. i lost my puppy and my wish of going to heaven is to see her again.
Now answer to the one true king for your crimes death comes to us all
I might not be a fan of any of those people either but why do you guys have to be so cancerous?
A thousand points of light...
British accent is so cool.
Know your abode is fire and fury.for eternal . You killed people thinking you are gonna live forever.murderer
Why doesn't Bush do a eulogy for all the dead Iraqis he caused for his oil tycoon
They can both rot in hell where they belong
BBC is fake news!
he should not give tribute bacoz he is responsible for killing of innocent Iraqis .
What a touching, funny and loving tribute from his son.
Best speech from George W Bush to his beloved father...
A WAR CRIMINAL HAS GONE ! GOOD SO !
Suicide bomber will be nice ...so many criminals together...☣️☢️
Well, that was truly elegant and healthy mind speaking. Kudos to the courage to face the loss of dear ones. Got a lot to learn from this speech... and there comes last 60 seconds @12:00, indeed heavy to handle... RIP Mr. George HW Bush
0:21  Love how Bush said "Presidents and first ladies, and didn't acknowledge Trump individually.  LOOK AT TRUMP'S FACE!
Like father like son.I would never have believed that war crimes ran in the family.
It hurts so deep to lose mom and dad..
How did Jeb get an invitation to this event?
Dear BBC, why are you burying real news, to cover the funeral of an evil man?
I remember the only slipper was thrown😃
Good video
TRUMP LOOKS LIKE HE IS TAKEN A DUMP 😍😀😃😄😜
🇺🇸 USA
Murderers
Who was the person in the robe and the wizard stick?
How about world trade centre. .......is his job. ....no face
I thought that George Bush died, not his father...... Well now I know
I see.
That's the America I like. You can crack a joke and show a sense of humor in your father's funeral, without being disrespectful.
You people saying horrible things...y'all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.. RIP Mr. Bush and prayers for healing with his family members and friends.
All the money, fame, power... at the end, nothing left but a legacy of... ?
They can both go to hell

Thugs
Why would we say nice things about these murderers.
老布什总统比他儿子小布什不知道强多少倍！但是小布什又比现在的特朗普强多少倍！美国现在的总统是一届不如一届😂

One down, couple more generations to go and we’ll either be rid of this family or it will have inbread enough that it’ll join our royal family 🇬🇧
Rest in jet fuel
Dear president Bush, I sincerely wish you to burn in hell for forever.
R I P,H W Bush may god forgive his sins what he did as a human and as a president of United States.
300 million Americans and its skull and bones members again and again
very nice eulogy...for once racism/black oppression wasn't brought up
Both son and father was a terrorist.... They can bomb any nation without proves ....soon son will taste the death and dwelt in hell with his dad...
RIP ☺
Now you can see that they are human just like everyone else.Sorry I can't say the same about Trump,cause did you see him barely shaking his head saying "no" at 11:46
bbc worse than cnn
I’m on the highway to hell🔥🔥🔥
Great.
I'm delighted he's gone (YAY) may he & his family burn in hell <<< BUSH
Burn in hell :)
A criminel paying tribute to his criminal father
Good riddance, should of be swinging from a rope long ago, lets hope his son is swinging from his neck before he leaves this mortal coil ,F$$king tyrants............
This was a beautiful speech, it's just a shame that none of it was true. I'm sorry for the family's loss of course, but I can never forget the appalling atrocities that man has caused. All those vulnerable women & children whose lives have been destroyed forever, and all the lives taken by his actions, those are the people my love & sympathy are with. I know also that I shouldn't talk ill of the dead, so I won't. I'll search my soul for something kind to say instead. This is what I've come up with.......





I'm on a fools errand.
Kill them. No better murder them. Never leave the supporters.
I'm sure his burning in hell no doubt
In my country we say.about death people, only good talk.So I have nothing to say.but I'm not sad bcz of his death.and I believe too that only few % in the world care about. Illuminati elite
bush family thank you kosovo kid thank you and with my albanians brother rip president
To all the people who chose voice your political opinion about the Bush Family: Not the time, very inappropriate, and shame on you.
God curse America.
Rip you are now bush food. I wonder if he's still worshipping Satan? God is good.. I thought today felt good and now I know why.. good riddance.
The ex-ruler of USA speaking of his late father, all the good is being praised, BUT the gruesome reality is swept under the royal carpet. Histories are written with reams of lies,  This is what is entrenched in the people of USA & the people of the world, LIES. Truth is bitter & lies are bitter sweet, so the people have been bombarded for eons with the second option, & the people truly believe these"lies" to be the "truth",!!!! May the Good Lord forgive us all for our judgements & choices. Peace out.
🦀🦀🦀🦀
Thật tuyệt vời
The Bush family has served the United States for many years. Truly they have shown both leadership & class in inviting President & Melania Trump to attend the memorial. Blessings to the current Pres. & also to all of our former Pres. & their families.
Elected by the people and they kept world peace every president in the church.Unlike the UK head of state and her hereditary replacement through the British democratic deficit.
Looking at all these comments below just shows me the true power of evil. Evil breeds more evil. Our culture of negativity, paranoia, hate, war, greed, conspiracy, etc.....it all starts up at the top, and trickles down to the citizens below. It takes a strong mind to not let your soul become full of hate. I did not vote for either Bush, and I despised their policies. You people celebrating your hatred of the man upon his death are equally as fucked up.
Seeing Obama and trump that close kind of freaks me out
Something most of these two men’s victims didn’t get .
The bush dynasty is OVER.
The deaths of millions are on their hands.
And they WILL pay. In this life & the next.
May Allah swt thrust him in the deepest part of Hell for s all the evil committed from this evil person and those with him against Muslim world, where he has gone none can help him know except Allah swt
Evil
weg damit , und den rest auch
Evil followers gathered, soon your turn g bush dog
Hope he burns in hell
The most successful criminal this world has ever seen! Prescott Bush was a Nazi collaborator with Union Bank.
kabbale..soooo criminal. Es lebe Trump!!!!
I can’t believe how disrespectful people are... is this seriously the world we’re living in? Someone dies that you don’t like so you tell them to “rot in hell”? That’s pathetic...
And thus Lucifer welcomes another to the pits of hell, to suffer a personal torment until the ends of eternity. . . Look closely, as many Luciferian NWO players sit in that hall.
War mongering skull and bones member sending off another war mongering skull and bones member.
In my opinion former president bush jr handle the 9/11 attacks well I didn’t agree with war cause I had to say goodbye to my dad many times when he left to serve our country first time I was 4. I respect everyone in that room because there human if I agree with them or not does not matter. It is so sad to see someone burying a loved one but his speech was amazing. (Sorry for poor grammar I suck at grammar)
Who cares go to Hell 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Human being are cruel, so as the comments here. Can't u all give respect to the departed soul.. shame n disgust u haters.. try love in ur hear..
😃😃😃😃😃😂
A very underestimated man George W.
How can this be?  David Icke says this guy was really an immortal Reptilian / illuminati Lord responsible for countless atrocities and a new world order plan of domination over the human race  !
Just bomb this room, and it's peace and prosperity on Earth guaranteed for the next 1000 years.
Reptilcans !
PABLO ESCOBAR IS HAPPY NOW HIS COKE AND WIL FLOW FREE THROUGH THE US
Another Devil going up to speak. That beaded eye devil.
Hope Trump rectify by the sermons
The rest of the Bush family should jump in before they fill the hole
Didn’t know he could read
Haters always ganna hate!!!
War Criminals Convention
Best President ever
You people are sitting here gawking over a traitor that mentioned the new world order over 200 times during his presidency.
Helped assassinate jfk.
And betrayed his men in the military and let them die. Thats how he ended up on a raft in the ocean.
He just ditched the plane he was flying WITH MEN ON BOARD without any warning and everyone on board except george hw bush died.
Thank god he is dead....
Don't feel sorry for him
God, this has just made me realise I will have to do this one day. I'm going to give my dad a big hug next time I see him. He is 72 and full of life but I so try not to think of the day I will have to speak in a church. What a lovely speech. Whether you agree with politics or not that's a son talking about his dad there and you can see the love.
R.I.P
Awww, so sad to see a war criminal go unpunished...
Rip.
Irony of commenters labelling bush as the devil when they spew nothing but death violence and hatred. I have no doubt all you guys would be the pigs in animal farm
Please respect the man funeral even if 'if' he was evil bashing his funeral makes you the same.
Most heinous terrorist in history
I am not sure if he can think about tens of thousands of people who loss their relatives and beloveds because of him and his father..
So many criminals in one room honoring another Criminal
Whatever your political beliefs I have to say that speech was very well written and delivered with humor as well as eulogy , not easy to hold one's composure in such circumstances, what sets Western civilization apart is how we honor our dead nobody does it better.
Brings back some nostalgic feelings as Bush Jr. speaks.
To hell wit the whole family
Rest In Peace r.i.p.
George "I destroyed the twin towers" W. Bush
This is a Satanic ceremony dressed up as Christianity. No wonder the BBC is getting excited.
war criminal!
how many people did he kill?
Imagine burning for eternity lmao
Lucifer is probably in hell, hammering away to give his brother the best return party ever - I could only imagine how over the moon he would be when his nephew joins his father and him
Thank god he's dead.
Hope hell has a special place for him, also his son.
U.S. Oligarchs
Trump = the only man in that room not part of the globalist project
You killed millions people War criminal father and son go to hell 🔥🔥🔥🔥👺👹👹👺👹👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Good riddance, the world is a better place without these satanic zionists preparing for anti-christ
He burns in hell for all the wars and deaths he has caused for his Masonic masters.
My Great President - George W Bush. I love you sir
Michelle O'bummer is the first man to be Flotus 👌🏼
