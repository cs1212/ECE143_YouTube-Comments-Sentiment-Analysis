I can’t believe Harry’s a dad now! 😭😩💕❤️ Much respect to him and Meghan!
CONGRATS !!!!!💜💜💜
A beautiful mixed baby boy, love it!
Racist comments can also be a sign of a mental illness. So I'll give the benefit of the doubt.
I feel bad for the tax payers
this is so precious I can't understand why anyone would hate on their new family
Why is Harry standing next to two horses? lol When they said a traditional birth I didnt realise it meant giving birth in an actual stable! :)
4,5 million British children in poverty Stuff the Royal family.
Please name the boy something like Clevonté aka Lil Clee Clee. Or name him QuadraCleon. Just some GREAT suggestions lol.
God bless them both.
Too many comments are just people whining about a monarchy most of the commenters don't live under/with. I bet you're all fun at parties.
But alas! This is not over. He will get his due in the end...
Félicitations
7 in line for monarchy crown ! Someone said  democracy ?
You got yourself alilniggaboy
How do you know did you consult your crystal ball.
CONGRATULATIONS to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, they have BOY JOY! All of their admirers are THRILLED for them! My name suggestion is: Mark Francis Charles.
Congrats awww
I’ve got a name suggestion, please name him Tyrone
Aww he looks so happy!❤❤❤😊
If they were ever to name him after his grandfather and knight him he would be Sir Charles
Look at every other news agencies  comments of happiness and congratulations,  and then look at Fox News comments. Someone needs to take out the trash lol.
Attention everyone Mike Gravel needs your help to get him in the dabates. You can donate to him as little as 1 dollar to get him in.
My 50 cent 1966 :You don't know what goes on in any family and the White Markles are not different but if you take the trouble to read his own interviews you will have an idea of the efforts made by the Sussexes to help him. If you love him tell him to stop taking instructions from sad Samantha.
Congrats!!
Happy Birthday Baby Sussex!!Congratulations Harry & Meghan, on the birth of Baby Sussex! I’m sure it felt like forever waiting to meet him. You both are such kind and  loving people and will be rockstars at parenting. I hope you never lose your childish enthusiasm. Take your time and enjoy your little family. God Bless from Virginia❣️
wow, it is amazing.
Congratulations <3
Ore cruento alterius ad vescendum!
he looks so happy. i hope you and your family will always be happy
♥️🙏baby love ♥️😀
Ehhh don't much care about royal , nasty people.
his name will be  Alexander..  just a guess.. lol .. and more names guys??
I think maybe Prince Harry and Meagan's son is San Tun Shwe's child with Joseph F.
Hewitt's a granddad!
So happy for The Duke and Duchess and Sussex!!!
Please name the baby Leroy Rufus Alexander William.
Great news:)
CONGRATULATIONS MEGHAN AND HARRY WE LOVE YOU! ❤️🥰💞👏🏽
Down with the royal family!
Interesting, the usual weight of a two week post term baby is 4.5 Kg. Or 9.9 pounds, someone is full of 💩
Lmfao, what a joke!
Reprobates
Who cares!!!!!
Ghetto baby
IF THE BABY IS WHITE IS NOT HIS....... THATS AN ADOPTED BABY 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Congratulations to the British taxpayer...another royal mouth to feed.
I have never seen Harry so happy, beaming from ear to ear. I am so happy for them.
Yay 😃😃😃
Not surprised by the disgusting, racist comments about a newborn baby. Now, think about it, this is a newborn baby boy and people are already saying horrible racist comments. Yet, we humans are the ones who are not going extinct.
Is his name Sir Daquan Dindu Nuffin Da IV?
Prostitutes have babies every day. Why is this news?
Congrats Harry, Meagan and Baby...❤❤🥳🥳🥳🥳💙💙❤❤👏👏👏👏🙌
So exciting! Congrats for them I'm sure the baby is beautiful <3
James Hewit must be happy about his new grandchild!!
Their baby is no more "royal"  than any of our children . 🙄
FINALLY SOME FLAVOR IN THE HOUSEEE😉😂😂😂😂
Congratulations Megan you improved your lineage.. and also will get a good chunk of inheritance.. Cause we all know you will divorce him and then get good child support.. Harry.. you should have listened to your grandma..
Verry smart Harry, keep it up and congratulations!
God that Harry is goofy AF lol!  He called the hatching a "Thing" LMAO! Guess we all know it's a lizard,  Illuminati,  Thing now!
Yay, now we can stop watching her hold up that MOON BUMP, LOL! JOKERS!
Baby should be given a flexible non-gender specific name like Pat, or Robin
Nice another reptilian archon baby born should have burn that thing alive soon as it was born ..
Another Illuminati #CULTOFBAAL luciferian demon born again
Can’t ever take THAT back.  That’s unfortunate.  🤢🤮
I can’t believe Meghan’s a dad now!  🤮
Who said "son"? That assumes its gender. This is a shameful setback for LGBTQ rights
7th un line to the throne I mean what throne. Theres no wars no sieges no nothing so why keep this stupid tradition like if we still in medieval times LOL. they just can't let go of the past
Meghan was on the reality TV shows all she wants is fame and money smh it's a shame
Good job to the surrogate mom I wonder how much she got paid.
💙👶
America is celebrating the birth of the Royal baby isn't that wonderful? making the US and British special relationship even closer than ever before.
Who really cares. So they had sex and she got knocked up. Millions of other couples have babies too. They are nothing special.   Lol
So Markle finally delivered a baby after 10 months of pregnancy??!!
He is a spawn of incest. This is real life game of thrones right here.
The Anti Christ has been Born. NOW BEGINS REVELATIONS!!
🤘😈🤘
I wonder how many stupid liberals that tell us every day that Trump's a dictator even though there's not even a single solitary shred of evidence that that is true are sitting here rejoicing the birth of a royal son to one day rule over the people of England it's so pathetic
HE, SHE, i mean IT is going to wish it was never born 🤢🤮
born into a freak show family 
GOOD LUCK!
Aww congrats to them!
His grandmother & father are evil people. Many will never know because they are literally above all laws, and untouchable. That "Royal Family" has destroyed so many peoples lives, and has damaged many in their paths. Goes back centuries.
Help
Yes!
Royal Trash
they are all demons
Lets hope its some hialrious african name.  I be Prince Know wha Im saying
The Royal boy
☺️☺️☺️☺️
Erase.  I think maybe Prince Harry and Meagan son is San Tun Shwe son with Joseph F.
Nobody cares. Save the child from those "parents".
LEEROY PUFF-DADDY JUNGLEBANGER was FINALLY born and I'll bet the surrogate is glad not be carrying that ghetto b@stard anymore.
Congrats Meghan and markle
BABIES NAME IS   KFC
KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN
This is what happens when you allow foreign races into your country...you risk  corrupting even the royal succession bloodline.
Born on Cinco de Mayo and the day after my birthday!😊. Now everyone will celebrate the royals baby on his birthday!😊
Gotch yoself alilniggaboy.
Is the baby colored?
Another guilty baby that allows the minorities to write themselves into the host nations history and to erase the NATIVE englkish from their own.  How long before it was blacks that landed on the moon?   Or invented flight and combustion engine?  ALREADY happening.
After a year Prince Harry will be filing for a divorce.. He should have listened to his grandma.. He ruined the royal heritage.. Big mistake.. Never believe in blacks.. I'm not racist is just a fact..
💃💕🏃PRINCE CHARMING &  HIS PRINCESS/WIFE DID IT THERE WAY🍼👶🍼
