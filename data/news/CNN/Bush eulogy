That moment, George W. Bush was not the former US President. He was simply a son who just lost his Dad...
Please put politics aside and just appreciate a sons love for his father
i would be happy to be able to give my dad a eulogy even half as good as this
when he broke down at the very end,  every one of us also broke down shedding a tear
This is just a son who loves his father. That's all.
I'm not a big fan of Bush family but rest in peace George. We all deserve these words when we die. Greetings from Finland!
I didn't support W while he was President, but I always believed that he was a decent man. This eulogy for his father is a wonderful example of that fact. I just wish other Presidents are as decent of a human being.
You know, I'm no where near a Republican. But even I can watch with respect as George W. Bush mourns his father. RIP George H.W. Bush.
Great speech by a son in grief for his late father! I am very sorry for his loss to this day!
Are you seriously going to put ads in a eulogy CNN? Shameful.
Man what an incredible speech.
I know he’s got a reputation as a bad speech-giver or whatever but dang, not bad George.
“A heart that’s broken is a heart that’s been loved.”  There is definite comfort in that, believe me.

I can relate: I lost my dad two months ago.  He was not just my dad, but also, my best friend, hero, mentor and business partner of 24 years.
I don't know why I cannot restrain from shedding a tear every time I get to the ending of the eulogy. ...
Long marriage, long life, successful kids, great career, life won. Rest easy.
No matter, how rich or poor you are, death will come to all.
Whatever you think of George Bush - this broke my heart 💔
How is it that 8 thousand ppl put a thumbs down to this video. Put your political agendas away and admit that was a touching eulogy for his father!
Thank you both so much for your service
I find it incredibly inappropriate that there are ads on this video.
The older he gets the more he looks like his dad!  RIP H.W.
This was a really really good and heartfelt eulogy, many people mock Bush junior and his intellect, but I'll say this... I'd be proud to be able to give such a eulogy. Good job junior. RiP George H W Bush
This made me cry. What a beautiful tribute to a lovely human being.
The best eulogy! A great man and a beautifully, profound eulogy. God Bless the Bush family.
Take off the ads. TF is wrong with you guys monetizing this video.
This is so amazing and it's said so kindly by a great man about a great man and I pray for peace over your whole family and may God bless and keep you all close and know that you are all in our thoughts, prayers and our hearts
Love him or hate him, the man lost both his parents within months of each other and obviously loved them very much and feeling the pain of their loss as we all would if we were in his place.
God bless United State of AMERICA
I love at 12:03 he gives a little tap on the coffin... Like saying to his dad "got through this for ya, you take care and say hi to robin and mom up there"
A fortunate man for his father be alive when he himself is in his 70's.
I will always love the Bush Family. RIP GHB... 😥
This eulogy is just so beautiful 😫
this is 100% beautiful... it truly showed a sons love for his father... both were presidents.. but in this speech george w was simply a son that cherished his father...
One miracle by turning president turns to a emotional nightmare with George W. Bush's dad dying. Who also was president. These guys made some good dang accomplishments!

R.I.P George H.W. Bush
1924 - 2018
He served the USA well...
Ads in the middle of a presidential eulogy? That's pretty lame
He was trying so hard to keep his composure.... rip bush sr
It feels like my own grandfather died, thars how I still feel !! You will be sorely missed. RIP #41 🇺🇸
George.H.W.Bush is standing in my heart forever!
God bless all Bush’s family.
Love him or hate him, burying a parent will always be a hard thing to do
RIP George H.W. Bush
Cry for the children traffiker George Sr.  killed and abused
I'm from Argentina, I read both his books Decision points and 45, which I found totally inspiring. This speech was inspring and very emotional too. Rest in peace G.H.W.B
Rip George H. W. Bush on November 30th 2018
I was not a fan of Jr as a president but the way he honored his father was heartwarming and  with obvious love for him.
You will be remembered WELL!  Thank you Mr. President for your service.
American cowboys are smart. God bless America! Thank you for your service. GWB
The ending had me tearing up.  And I like the full throttle or sleep analogy.   And the gray goose narration.  Good bye for now.
You’re here for 11:40

2 Bush’s down, at least 2 more to go
I've always loved bush's family especially G.H.W he was a solid man with a  heart full of joy  .my tears r falling . he was a great man . a great father .a great husband .
He is a good soul. Bless you President Bush
Damn. I cried. 😥
To lose a parent is never easy. At any age and whoever they are.
Much respect and love to the family. No matter the political agendas or belief, this is a funeral, my condolences.
I Like George W Bush's Family And Barak Obama's ; They Are really Kindheart Families . God Bless You All More And More .
This is a truly heartfelt eulogy. Playful little jabs and a wonderful tribute, balanced in a speech that inspires others.
Thousand points of light
Say what you want about this man,   but Dad would've been proud of this speech
I just love bush southern accent
George Bush is on his way to meet with JFK and receive justice. What do you think?
THIS IS JUST A SON WHO LOVES HIS FATHER,  THAT'S ALL...👊👊👊👊👊👊❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝👍👍👍👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪💪🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
I came here to only listen to, what a son had to say about his father.
I loved barbara bush...she seemed like a very lively nice person .she was full of life and optimism
I think this should put political sides apart, this is a son speaking about sweet memories of his father. RIP Bush Sr
Great man and Great President!
That was so emotional for him
"ladies of the night" *camera pans to Bill*
I feel his pain as I do as mine. May you RIP Mr. GHWB.
Absolute Dignity, Respect, and Honor
I'm gonna knock your building down like George Bush... 😂😂😂
Finalmente ese asesino. Se enfrentara a su creador. .. Falta su malvado hijo.
Unfortunate that CNN chose to monetize this video.
If you're gonna put ads on the video, at least out targeted ads related to the topic. So I suggest you out an ad of Visine eye drops, Kleenex, sun glasses, etc
RIP George H. W. Bush. You will be missed 😭
Jimmy Carter has the longest life outside of his Presidency, out of all the President's with 38 years.  It used to be Herbert Hoover with 31
I hope that when I'm gone, and if I have been blessed with children, that they will remember as fondly as W does his father here.
"Die old, as young as you can" - Dead Farang
Rip President George H. W. Bush!
The Mainstream Media  so mercilessly  CRUCIFIED  this man,  that he left Office with an approval rating of 29 percent  .
Did'nt like him as president but he's a gentleman , funny and very likeable person. This is one of the best speeches i've ever heard.
The best public speech I have heard George Jr. speak. Well read.
lost both his parents only months apart. Hard on anybody.
LOTS OF TRAITORS SITTING I  THAT FRONT ROW!!!
YOU CAN ALL THANK BUSH SENOR FOR CHEMTRAILS!!!
NOT TO MENTION JFK ASSASSINATION
Thank you George Bush for everything.
Beutiful speach. God bless your family.
i love cnn because it always  tells me the truth...thank you cnn for keeping me informed
Will be a long time before another former US president gives a Eulogy to their father who was also a US president. RIP HW Bush.
what kind of religion george bush jr belive in?
Such beautiful words to pay tribute and honor his dad. I was truly touched and moved ....
Gwb looks so different now
I like how while watching this, I have my background on black screen, so all other colors on screen are the red, white, and blue 👍
Whether you like him or not...  Bush gives a damn good eulogy.
Lol Bill Clinton looked high af
If you know in what this family is all involved then you can enjoy the show. #911 #pizzagate
Mr. President,
What about my friend Juan Pierre Griffin and Fort Ord, California.?
George Bush just merked every speech obama ever gave... That was incredible
Nice speech George. Your dad would be proud of you.
God bless his soul
STOP ANDRENACHROME HARVESTING. 💯🖕 🏃💥🔫
we are here to watch this one depart this world ,
bon voyage
The man still lost his father people should still show respect for him
Whether you like him or not... Bush gives a damn good eulogy.
Thanks for letting us experience what Mass Murderer looks like crying .....
*Insert Rage Against The Machine Testify*
Wow, that was a wonderful speech
i legit cried like a baby watching this.
There is no shame in crying over the death of a beloved father.
3:04 oh Jared, Jared, Jared... you couldn't even keep a straight face for the occasion?
Prescott Bush taught them well.
The man lost his father, love him or hate him, respect to him for being REAL here
He crying, because he just got dad's money
Y'all need to remember this isn't a politics thing, this is a man standing in front of the world and mourning his father. Show some respect
Wow, that's the best thing I ever heard George Bush say, that was real, I may never like them as presidents but that was great, I got love for this.
That's crazy. Bush can actually show emotion.
Your dad wasn't a good president I'm despised him greatly
I know this hard to do. To speak at your father’s funeral. God bless his soul
if you wanna know what really happened to SR. watch the end of the movie replicas ..hes still here
We know The military kill bush
SKULLS & BONES ANYONE?
I'm generally fine about the 41st. I thought he was trying hard as president.
Seeing President Bush cry like this completely made me forget about him as a president with policies I didn't agree with...and more as a human being just like the rest of us.
I was blessed to meet President Bush and Mrs Bush #1 and cooked for him briefly when I was with Marriott.
He was such a wonderful man and Barbara Bush the finest of all of our 1st Ladies in the 20th and 21st century.
As for President Bush #2, my respect has grown from his 9/11 eulogy at the National Cathedral.
Mr Bush #2 is a great man, sure made mistakes, what man and woman has not made mistakes, big and small.
But his love of his parents, his wife and kids...no one can deny that.
RIP President HW Bush and Mrs Bush together united with Our Lord and their lil girl Robin.
Thank You President Bush for your Naval Service, CIA, Congress, Senate, VP under President Regan and President.
The most qualified POTUS this nation has ever scene and will not see again.
Peace to all
Pax+
I love the bush family from the father  and to son. Rip. My president.
This made me cry😢
Setting aside political opinions, Bush Jr was President when I was ages 10 - 18, so I feel some kind of strange connection to this man. To watch him stand before the country again, not as President, but as a man who lost his mother earlier this year, and now has to say goodbye to his father - and a man with real love and pain in his heart - This video made me cry. Beautiful speech.
I didn’t know his father was alive 
i mean since he was a .... nvm
Bush Jr is seriously my favourite president ever - Fair Well Bush Senior
Telling the truth is not disrespect Bud.But you can respect him for both of us OK?
... wow -that was a beautiful eulogy....
Love your parents and enjoy them while they are with you
No one can serve two masters!
Oh it's the scherf family from Germany.. don't take my word for it look it up.. we have the right to change your name don't we
Cursed is the man who dies,but the evil done by him survives
From the moment I saw George W. Bush running for President, I knew he was/is a good Man. Simple as that!
My dad passed away on this day, rip to all the fathers out there
This Video was made on my birthday...
謝謝你愛臺灣上頭會愛爸老 大總統 老布希 他去天國 大總統 小布希不要哭了 不再有哭泣 不再有眼淚 末日他的屍體 要 復活AcPH
I may not have agreed with Bush Sr. But watching this?i wanted to say to the family , I am truly sorry for your loss .That speech/tribute to his father was extremely hard to do  for Bush junior but he did it anyway . R.I.P
At 10:19 you see the presidents seated sequencially from left to right. Nice.
Sorry for Bush Jr. He lost father and mother in the same year.
Perfectly said!
Both Father and Son greatest president ever
Back to the lobby default dance
That ending was sad😭
Shame on CNN for having ads playing. No class.
Is he really dead?If True Im Glad That Evil Man  Is ..
The pain of loss is something that unites all humanity. Everyone no matter who, rich or poor, politically powerful or just a mere statistic feels it.
Ads? I expect no less from CNN!
Was it just me or did George W Bush did his dad proud?
Damn I did not agree nor appreciate W's time in office but what a wonderful eulogy to his father. A return to decency in the oval office is much needed.
Rip Mr bush
That was the only speech by junior I have ever been impressed by, could not have been easy.
This is great
Slick-Willy still got it!
It's not a president crying over the death of another president. But rather a son crying over the loss of his dad.  My condolences to the Bush family.
Rest in peace George bush he was short liness.her father cried to tears so sad to hear that in the hospital bed. 😭😢😭😢 ( Rest in peace George bush)(😭😭😭)
i understand he lost someone he loved but if he only cried as much for all the ppl he killed the world would be a better place
When he said what his last words were I actually think I had a mental breakdown crying.
Nice clickbait, CNN.
That pat on the coffin at the end got me
even tho i hate George bush,i kinda cried when he cried
You know you've lived a great life when all living presidents are at your funeral and one of them is your son.
masonic killers!!!!!
PRESIDENT BUSH IS MISSING US!!!!
Above all, he is human.  He lost his daddy.
Who see Donald J. Trump at 12:04 ?
George W Bush is about the only person in 21 years not to tell me to go pound sand. But that's exactly where many belong, in the sand, man!
That mether ducker 🦄whest 🌬👂
i miss the days they arrived in orbs of fire..
I'm a black guy from New Jersey and that really move me... Let's remember that we are the United States... Not the divided States
Cool bro 2 more to go!😂
Do you think he is going to heaven, to hell, or simply to disapear?  
Now you may hope that heaven and hell do not exist, and you will find out the truth very soon in the day of judgment.
Well done President Bush, I am truly blessed that we had George Herbert Walker Bush as one of our presidents. Even though I never knew him personally, I do know he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, something I am very much blessed was created, and I do thank him for that. God bless your soul George Herbert Walker Bush.
Well done Mr. President.
Man when he choked up that broke my heart.
Rest in Peace Mr President!
Stan Loona!
The gentle taps Bush Jr. made on his father's casket caught me good...
R.I.P. George Bush
Change the title. Something like, “George Bush gives tear-filled Eulogy” not “George Bush cries...”
he sound like forrest gump
RIP Father of the new world order!
u deserve it!!for what you have done to saddam!!may allah put u in hell!!!!
narikal kudi allum nadukul vedan oruvan sutri thirinchan
YouTube needs to remove the in video ads on this. Highly inappropriate.
May  his  gentle  soul  found  peace  in  the  blood  of  the  righteous . A great  leader  in human  history . Farewell
too many people dont respond with the affection of this man like the comments. he is where he belongs
How are you gonna put ads on this?
I don't care about political views, in this moment in time I just see human beings. I see a son who lost his dad and is grieving and I can feel the pain.
janis janissa was murdered by the way
George lived an amazing life, living to such an old age was a blessing for him. Being the President of this amazing country as well. I hope he rests well and is proud that he aided in making such an amazing country this amazing.
Oh...now CNN likes Bush....ummm.... Okay.  
Good with Obama,good with CNN
Lmfao Im sure its raining celebrations in Iraq. Good freakin' riddance.
Politics aside....it was so sentient

Beautiful eulogy from a son to a father he so clearly loved and respected.
Make jokes you think you find him in eden 😨

Trump at 4:45 😂
I love you too..
How nice of cnn to run three adds on a funeral eulogy
snr and jnr both crooks, and W is one of those involved in 9/11 inside job
TCHAU BUSH, AGORA É O TRUMP. 👏👏👏👏👏
I actually was thinking exactly the same for those who have compassion for murderers..
God bless America
4:16 That is so weird, seeing those people all sitting next to eachother.
The world would be a better place if that church exploded....
Written   Written Written,  Practice Practice, Written
A thousand points of light, eh?

Interesting.
I've always liked W. Bush. Now even more...
Man I teared up and I wasn't even born when he was president
Touching, even for a lying war criminal.
Bunch of devils , cause of every war of this universe
Remember when CNN hated both Bush’s?
4:42 Bill is next
Never liked the Bushs but I'm human and to watch him cry for his father provoked my humanity.  We're all human at the end of the day.
I'm surprised he didn't trip down the stairs.
Yo we now who next he got that Needle
So beautiful I'm speechless, so beautiful...
like him now good man good hart  his old man color blind so of him condolence rice all way a his side god bless them
Oof, that ending was difficult.
Let God judge both these men for their secrets.
great work for the polite white supremacy.
Breaking news!!! Son cries at fathers funeral!
Geeze
Anti American Scum!
of course he cried.. his DAD just passed away !  ... sometimes the headlines need to be more carefully though out...   More appropriate ... "George W. Bush Delivers Emotional Eulogy"
Isn’t the bush family part of the elite groups with Rothschild, Rockefeller’s , etc....?
1:00 In his 90's he took great delight in copping a feel on a female guest :-)
I can't belive the seahawks didn't run it
RIP President Bush. Looking forward to Trump's death.
GREAT R I P!!To an HERO
No matter how you feel about the bushes ..they are a family who sticks together.
1924-2018
what part of bush term in office was with dignity in iraq
I didn't always agree our 43rd president but i was touched. His speech was beautiful, a class act.
3:59  "he valued character over pedigree " ...
Very touching eulogy 😢
LMAO. Poppy murderer
Dang he gave a  great eulogy for his pops
His dad died and you're using his tears to clickbait and run ads?  Classy as always CNN.
finally u understand that feeling of middle east child when u lost u father..
2:49 bill is next. 🇷🇸
This is the most coherent iv ever heard dubya. And im starting to see. All politics aside. Hes a human. No matter what evil hes done. God judges that.
History made.
Those dang onion cutting ninjas. They always strike
When he patted his fathers coffin, that was hear warming
This is just incredibly wonderful. Humor, love and facts... this sums up the key to humanity, any party aside. God bless x
God Bless The Bush Family..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes he has every right to cry leave him alone you would cry to when your mom or dad dies
Did anyone notice Mr. rothchild over there?
Greatest Republican since roosevlt
While reading about a 20 +year vet killing him self, it reminded me of the deployment that George W ordered time after time , the hardships these men endured on the battle fields and the family’s back home these men couldn’t help . Now we see these strong men pushed beyond there limits being reduced to poverty for lack of health care and poorly supported facilities and ultimately killing them selves . Why Bush didn’t do more to enlist more troops I  can’t understand? We all are responsible for Americas security home and abroad. We will continue having soldiers returning from service with deep rooted problems as long as there returning to combat time after time . This may require a policy change that everyone will serve !everyone man and woman (3yrs). There is a place for all with great opportunity to career serve or educational investment . I remember thinking that these men can’t keep serving back to back and retain and maintain a positive attitude and healthy mindset. Bush was president and I feel this was his war with no weapons of mass destruction ever found they lied to us ,our family members died over this lie ! Dick  Chaney and Halliburton go hand in hand ! The support contracts for Desert storm went to Halliburton without any outside-bidding  .Some got Rich some died ,but George Bush was our president and these men answered to there commander!

God bless our men and woman that serve our Country
Think logic. These people are sick. Liberal tears
I love how in his obvious pain, he made his audience laugh💜💜
this was GREAT!!  What a great guy!  I've always liked 'W'.. Class A - kinda guy!!
Grapes anyone   ? LOL
waouh i a m still crying while watching this video
Can you guys spotted obama
I find it wrong to put he cries in the title, it’s his dad, of course he cried
His momma looks like the oatmeal man
I am surprised CNN showed this funeral was there no news by Anderson Cooper

You know why W was a boss ? He threw the folder like the baus at the end
2:49 What's up with Clinton? Giving his best Tucker Carlson impression?
Ad before this is on cleaning gutters. Ironic - that's where W and his dad belong.
I never voted for Bush or liked his politics but that eulogy he gave was the nicest one I"ve ever heard, it was perfect and so dignified.  Good one George.
hey man, go to prison
I like gwb
Wait was Jimmy Carter invited
Edit: Nvm but can we hit 2.5K likes for George H W Bush
I remember watching this part live at my school ❤️
I’ve never really been a fan of any of the presidents, but watching this and seeing that George could hold himself together for over 10 minutes talking about his fathers death then to see him tear up in front of everyone really got me
when does he start crying?
All I can write today is READ history, sure the Son cries for the Dad, that's understandable, but this is a Show.
GOAT ✊🏼
Damn I am crying
Wow. 73 years of marriage. Incredible people. Just don't get loyalty like that nowadays.
Nice play...
George H. W. Bush is in a better place now....holding his wife's and daughter's hand
Politics aside;humanity to humanity. We all mourn the loss of loved ones.  RIP Mr. Bush. May GOD receive you with arms wide open.
more lies written up by a hired speech writer
"To die Young, As late as possible!" 😂😂😂
Don’t read the comments if you want to continue believing in humanity
What a crock of...befitting of a broken toilet of a human being.
loyalty is in the blood
Oh so Noooowww you wanna remove the ads huh YouTube?? 🤦🏼‍♂️ 🖕🏻
Thanks for monetizing the video, so I can watch purple matress ad during a funeral speech
wonder if bernie madoffs funeral will be like this ?
Bush/Cheney gang brought United States demise, down to its knee and got away with taking Treasury money to companies they owned.
i love that
Your my next
G. Bush 43 had me in tears. G. Bush 41 did always seem like too much of a nice guy for Washington politics.
is it just me or is bill clinton for sure stoned?
Before u speak..read first who u are talking to..
No tears on my end
Die young as late as possible hmmmm
What a great speech from a president not known for his words.
The smell of blood still lingers ..All the perfumes of Arabia will not clean thy hand..
What's up with Clinton' expression at 2.49?
Ab tera kya hoga kalia
Killer cries for his father who is a well-known killer in the world. To the Hell Bush
At 12:03, a son taps the casket of his father, like a father taps the back of his little son. This time for the last time.  Love your Family...
Your murderer of millions
Damn great speech good president too
Hey wtf ?!
You may drag are feets to the ground , and put us to the executions in seconds the Stoner's will drag you  to the streets alive .
Never been a fan of his by any stretch but I got up and read a euology at my dad's funeral and it's not easy. He did exceptionally well.
I've commented as I watched at the end idk for sure who he was as a man or a president but I know one thing for damn sure if nothing else hearing his son's eulogy he was one hell of a great father.
may he suffer in their gods hell.
You are following him to hell dont worry.
I don't consider Bush the smartest guy out there, I don't think any of us do, but I think he is a genuine dude. I think he got taken advantage of in office because of his good nature by the ruthlessness and insidious intellect of Cheney, Rove and the like.
EVIL!!!
I cried
R.I .P gorge h.w bush
Last words: I love you son
That's more tears than he shed for the 9-11 victims he had killed
Only the hardest of hearts wouldn’t have been moved by that eulogy. That was really touching. R.I.P. President Bush.
Mr. Bush your family is a bloodline of crooks and you know it!
What a great speech for your father
Much Love
Those tears are Weapons of Mass Manipulation. Bomb him.
He was not a former president.  He was a son saying goodbye to his father.  What a moving moment.
Don’t put ads CNN
I'm guessing Trump is sitting on the end of the isle in case there is an emergency?
Murderers family. RIH#Rest in Hell
Who's he talking about? Surely not his father! He LOVED his father so much that he didn't go to his bedside to hear his last words BUT spoke to him on the phone! that's his type love.
It's all an illusion.
There is talk that he was executed, makes more sense, when I heard he only had minutes to live I CALLED him & the man said he hasn't spoken all day, but you said I love you Dad & he said I love you too son.
Sounds like the last words for all his bad decisions he's made.
& That's a heck of a lot.
I’d wear sunglasses next time I go to a funeral or tinted shades. I couldn’t eulogize my parents he’s very brave.
When he lost it, I did too.
I have a secret desire for a time travel machine to make the days of Reagan and Bush to come back again.  W was right on and honestly his stock goes up every day.  Can you even imagine Gore on that bullhorn after 9/11 uniting the country?  RIP GHWB SIR  and THANK YOU for your service to and for leading this great country.

If i were to do a eulogy for my dad id probably be crying the first minute while im talking about my dad
Hey george its me nega
One mass murderer praising another mass murderer.
how can people be mad about ads? This guy has wronged every single one of us on a scale incomparable to most things experienced in modern history???
Classic Bush Jr. staring off the eulogy with some funny stories of his father. I really cried when he started to break into tears at the end. the poor guy, I know that feeling of pain
Double Lives.
Absolute class.
war criminal cries for war criminal. 

please laugh
I can't hold it anymore 😭........
Wow what a fantastic tribute from a son! Prayers are with you
A great American family.
Bush = Serff=major criminals....as you will all soon see.

BUSH:    WHEN THE HISTORY BOOKS ARE WRITTEN, THEY WILL SAY THAT GEORGE H. W. BUSH WAS A GREAT PRESIDENT...  

ME:        NO HE WASN'T 

"History is written by the victors" by Winston Churchill
Yo they straight roasted him.
Doesn't matter if your left or right or NA, this man's dad passed away respect him and their family's morning. He was an American, a father, a president but at end of each day he had a family man, had children, friends etc. RIP SIR
Best speech I've ever heard from the man.
I'm surprised half the audience isn't full of Saudi Arabians government contractors. Must have been at the private event.
10:51 kfc
Why didn’t he die with his father
No hate here. Just my condolences for the loss of his pops.  Rest in peace.
Wonderful eulogy. I hope my children will remember me with love and laughter.
I didnt know murderers can also cry..u have 5000 victims of wtc on ur conscious...
God bless you
Georgian Voice
You know what annoys me? The title of this video. Yes, he cries, but he did a damn good job delivering his fathers eulogy, that’s hard to do - I’ve delivered two of them...

Give the man some credit, title the video “George bush delivers heart felt speech in memory of his father” 

Annoying. Click bait title. 

Great job W. Dad will Rest In Peace
A great eulogy of a great President and loving father
One hell of an eulogy!
GOO TOO HELLLL!!!!
Man 73 years of marriage...that's unheard of. I hope he and Laura are reunited.
Someone has to die for everyone to come together.
One of my all time personal favorite sayings is😤 "a man dont need no arm, no leg😷, to be thrown in no lake a fire alaive!😌

In fact is hwat the maneuver "tossing a thing" is know for....it dont got no arms, no legs....and since im top scribe and interpreter of the law....well then!
Great speech Bush jr we all love you
Sniff
He did 911
GEORGE W. BUSH FOR NEXT PRESIDENT
we love you George h w Bush
Were all humans at the end of the day, love cry and die, all the Same
MASS MURDERER
No matter how any of felt about this man, you're still seeing a son grieving his favorite man...his father r.i.p Mr.President ...pray for the son as well...
Legacy of death exploitation deception and pure evil.
I understand about politics 
and I understand that his father died
R.I.P
Jimmy Carter is hanging on in there......he is still living.
how can a man that's responsible of the death of millions, cherish the gift of life!
The devil has a special hell for these truly evil men.
Frogs and toads are in the process of getting the keys back from the father and they come back to you with the harshest of judgement shall be judged back and will be 10 times and thrice on Sunday 😂😂😂😂😂😂🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🐙🐙🐙🐙🏃🐙
Why would someone film a funeral? Those are very personal. It doesn’t matter if you’re a former president or a celebrity.
These damn onions...
awkward 4:17
These things pray to Satan !!
siento mucho el fallecimiento de su padre  sr george w b
Will we ever hear about how he had JF Kennedy assassinated when he worked for the CIA
That’s a lot of presidents in one room!
Who remembered when George was president?
I do.. with all 5 of them. I am lucky I have such good kids.
How pathetic do you have to be to bash a man who is giving the final words to his father and said father. Death and dying and grief and sorry and loss is one thing that everything and everone have in common. Regardless of politics this was a Beautiful Eulogy for his daddy he would be proud.
Very Proud Of Trump!  Very Sad for the Clintons and hillarys Hatred!  Nothing Said in Eulogy about a Testimony of Whether and How The Former President knew Jesus Christ as his own personal Savior.  Very Sad.  
A lot of People want to please people instead of Jesus in the world we live in.
Death is inevitable but it’s less sad when you live to your 90s, have a long marriage and a great family & career. 

At least they passed peacefully and not young and badly.
this is sad
Freemasons dont go to heaven....but i hope he repented....
What do you say about dad he loved me even after I did 911 haha
Politics aside, does anyone else find it odd for people to clap so much for a speech at a funeral?  I'm not making any statement about it being right or wrong, it just strikes me as weird
What a wonderfully poignant job "W" did....that he lost it a bit made it even more heartfelt and again validated the great love all seem to have had for George HW Bush.  He will be missed
Don't blame the puppet blame the puppet masters.
George h.w. bush is murder of jfk. I can tell you.
Agent pick m ent ep
Rip peace you never wrote that letter but at least the window shades where closed.
I served in the Army from 1986 - 2006 and President's Bush (41) and Bush (43) were both my Commanders in Chief. All politics aside, one cannot watch and hear the words of Pres. George H.W. Bush's son and not feel empathy for him as a human being. It is incredibly difficult to eulogize a parent and Pres. Bush did an amazing job. My deepest condolences are extended to the Bush family as they mourn the loss of their family member.
Donald allias "FAKE NEWS!"
Sad...
He's lost his mum dad and he only has his son left
Love you mr president 
Very touchy moment
Feels cheap to monetize a funeral.
Prayers. Hehe, that's so awkward Clinton, Obama & Trump sitting together.
11:40 probably the time W has shown most emotion in public. Not a fan of the man as a president, but I always believed he was at least a likable human being
10:23 🇺🇸
Does anyone remember the whole cop-a-feel moment when senior groped a woman... or the fact that both father and son are international war criminals...
💙QQQQQQQQQ💙WWEG1WGA💪👽
I wonder what twitlers thinking,if anything!
Boch non
I am talking to every one and my self, do remeber that one day all of us will die and every will be counted what he or she did(if you do not bleive that)one exampale wiil be given to you.every thing like clothes, shoes, computers, laoptops have been by human, yes?
.so who has created us???? Think i do not mind which religion you have. Think of that  think of that, think of that
.
Jimmy Carter still alive is a blessing
I saw the President #41 and he waited for people to come say hello to him. What a truly wonderful man and family. He gave all his life to our country. Thank you very much Mr. President and Mrs. Barbara Bush. I miss you both so much. Your message and love will live forever.
In retrospect I think all of us on the left might be well served by not being so hard of politicians on the right. Comparing George W to Trump makes me wonder why we thought George W was stupid.
A thousand points of light?
Go to ‘In Persuit of Truth ‘ dated 1-4-19.   Get past first minute then know the TRUTH 😎
This is the single greatest speech of George W Bush's life. Very touching. It shows the soul of both men and I leave this speech thinking better of both than I did before. Wonderful job W. You father would be proud.
I’ve always heard how some people say George W. Bush was not a good president.  Well I don’t know if I agree or not, but I will say that he had some of the worst things happen in America during his term.  Good President or not, he dealt with what the previous President left for him to take over and possibly fix, which was impossible. During what was probably one of the toughest speeches he has ever given, he was personable and genial. Laughter through tears is one of my favorite emotions. God Bless the Bush family during their time of sorrow.  George W. Bush delivered a beautiful eulogy.
Mr. President,
How come my friend, Juan Pierre Griffin, didn't have a military and or civilian chain of command at Fort Ord, California.?
I love Iraq
It makes me sad to see the division within the comments of this thread. We live within realms of extremes.  Fear.  Paranoia.  But also love, compromise, and growth.  I'm not of any party.  More of issue by issue.  News, facts, and comprehensive reasoning are tools we have at our fingertips today.  Stop reacting in extremes.  Many humans of power have made mistakes.  Some are immoral.  There is no reason to continue the venom of hate on a video of a man mourning his father.
I didn't care for their views and policies. I do sympathize with the loss of both parents.
WOW!!! Heartfelt, touching, funny.......what a wonderful eulogy to a special man.
4:45 lol
I love my dead gay son.....😭😭😭😭
He was the last statesman.
No matter what your views are of any of the Bush family, that was awesome.
CNN recordes this and zooms in on trump lol.... fake news bahaha
bush did 911
Now he knows what it is like to lose  the head of the family that was so close to you.
Devil
As sad as it is to lose both parents in the same year. He’s very lucky they had long lives, they had each other for so long, and that he had 72 years with both parents.
Wow...
SO Tragic ㅜㅜ
I did not have sexual relations with that woman
Ahhh, CNN. Ad breaks on a presidents Funeral video. Classic CNN
"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful. And so are we. They never stop thinking about ways to harm our people and our country. And neither do we."
-George Bush
I THOUGHT BUSH COULDN'T SPEAK WITHOUT MUMBLING OR STUTTERING? WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT? LET ALONE READ. BOY THE MEDIA ARE SOME TRICKY MOFOS.
El tipo que armo guerras con excusas  , mentiras , etc . Solo sacrifica vidas y hoy quiere ser el bueno jaja  ya te llegara la hora como a todos.
This guy would be burning in his grave.
This should #1 trending 
not that YT Rewind fiasco
Everyone will .....
Give me an reasonable explantion of 8.6 dislikes. PLEASE TELL Me
PREDATORS
كم من شخص توفي جراء تحقيق حلم أبيك في العراق  الله وحده عليم.
I don't get how he didn't just break down crying and instead just choked a bit. He must be a very strong man to go up there and speak about his father and not break down. This is beyond me
The killer,  murderer, The real terrorist.. Many people were  killed by george...
Nobody get mad at me for this.. 


Jeb is a mess.
every one should die one day no matter who is he or she but the think is  he or she is  good or bad i rate him as bad in many ways son is worser than him
I shed tears man we're all created by the good lord and are brought into this world as little children.. As we mature we all sway away from the perfection and innocence we were created from hence, we're all children of God and 
We're all equally sinners. I pray my God brings peace to this man's heart and soul and that he's lead towards redemption. Forgiveness is bliss
CNN: this guy cried at his father's funeral, we can make money off of that!
Nice..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs1bHp0mHAI
George HW Bush assassinated JFK, was tried for treason and was put to death.

Look into it.
What a great speech. Performed to the T. Too bad they are all corrupt lizard people
I Hope My Son Speaks of Me That Way When I Pass.
🤣🤣🤣😂  حق با شماست هیچی خنده و شوخی نمیشه
Crybaby jerk
Regardless of whatever he has done the killing in Iraq, the 1989 gulf war that was planned and the fake reasons that was given to attack Iraq by the son as a revenge to his father I can only say god is faire , his father died and his mom died months ago I believe that he needs a break and we pray god to help him through as it is not easy loosing a mother and a father in a same year  , god bless .
9/11.... that's all I'm gonna say.
Just another proof that,
"Every man is a child" 
No matter your status or influence
wtf I thought he was the one who died, nvm I'm not from the U.S
President Bush was a great president and great man. I'm talking about W. Hes a man of dignity and yes made mistakes and trump will never hold a candle to either Bush. I love W as a Democrat and hes a great man
I hated him.
Dont worry he is in Hell :)
LIL BUSH BEST SPEECH EVER
Arnold Schwarzenegger hmm?
And all trump did was sit with his arms closed and he and  his wife never smiled! 
Trump is the worst president we have ever ver had!
Wish we could have him back as president now.
i dont know why we didnt just topple saudi Arabia , like iraq ....well i know why iraq ...a couple  reasons for iraq.... maybe its because we actually control ,or israel and usa control saudi arabia.
Just shows how close he was to his dad, and how proud he was being his son. May Bush senior rest in peace.
hum Bush jr what about 911
Ibfeel nothing for this man.
these comments are pitiful. Show some respect damn
Fcukn neighbors...with theirs thoughts and voices that still feel as though they need to be heard.
EULOGY

Distinguished Guests, including our presidents and first ladies, government officials, foreign dignitaries and friends: Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro and I, and our families, thank you all for being here.

I once heard it said of man that "The idea is to die young as late as possible."
At age 85, a favorite pastime of George H.W. Bush was firing up his boat, the Fidelity, and opening up the three-300 horsepower engines to fly -- joyfully fly -- across the Atlantic, with Secret Service boats straining to keep up.
At 90, George H.W. Bush parachuted out of an aircraft and landed on the grounds of St. Ann's by the Sea in Kennebunkport, Maine -- the church where his mom was married and where he'd worshipped often. Mother liked to say he chose the location just in case the chute didn't open.
In his 90s, he took great delight when his closest pal, James A. Baker, smuggled a bottle of Grey Goose vodka into his hospital room. Apparently, it paired well with the steak Baker had delivered from Morton's.
To his very last days, Dad's life was instructive. As he aged, he taught us how to grow old with dignity, humor and kindness -- and, when the good Lord finally called, how to meet him with courage and with joy in the promise of what lies ahead.
One reason Dad knew how to die young is that he almost did it -- twice. When he was a teenager, a staph infection nearly took his life. A few years later he was alone in the Pacific on a life raft, praying that his rescuers would find him before the enemy did.
God answered those prayers. It turned out he had other plans for George H.W. Bush. For Dad's part, I think those brushes with death made him cherish the gift of life. And he vowed to live every day to the fullest.

Dad was always busy -- a man in constant motion -- but never too busy to share his love of life with those around him. He taught us to love the outdoors. He loved watching dogs flush a covey. He loved landing the elusive striper. And once confined to a wheelchair, he seemed happiest sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at Walker's Point contemplating the majesty of the Atlantic. The horizons he saw were bright and hopeful. He was a genuinely optimistic man. And that optimism guided his children and made each of us believe that anything was possible.
He continually broadened his horizons with daring decisions. He was a patriot. After high school, he put college on hold and became a Navy fighter pilot as World War II broke out. Like many of his generation, he never talked about his service until his time as a public figure forced his hand. We learned of the attack on Chichi Jima, the mission completed, the shoot-down. We learned of the death of his crewmates, whom he thought about throughout his entire life. And we learned of his rescue.
And then, another audacious decision: He moved his young family from the comforts of the East Coast to Odessa, Texas. He and Mom adjusted to their arid surroundings quickly. He was a tolerant man. After all, he was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he, Mom and I shared a bathroom in our small duplex -- even after he learned their profession -- ladies of the night.
Dad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic man. He valued character over pedigree. And he was no cynic. He looked for the good in each person -- and usually found it.
Dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary; that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values, like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back to the community and country in which one lived. He recognized that serving others enriched the giver's soul. To us, his was the brightest of a thousand points of light.
In victory, he shared credit. When he lost, he shouldered the blame. He accepted that failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen.
None of his disappointments could compare with one of life's greatest tragedies, the loss of a young child. Jeb and I were too young to remember the pain and agony he and Mom felt when our 3-year-old sister died. We only learned later that Dad, a man of quiet faith, prayed for her daily. He was sustained by the love of the Almighty and the real and enduring love of our mom. Dad always believed that one day he would hug his precious Robin again.

He loved to laugh, especially at himself. He could tease and needle, but never out of malice. He placed great value on a good joke. That's why he chose Simpson to speak. On email, he had a circle of friends with whom he shared or received the latest jokes. His grading system for the quality of the joke was classic George Bush. The rare 7s and 8s were considered huge winners -- most of them off-color.
George Bush knew how to be a true and loyal friend. He honored and nurtured his many friendships with his generous and giving soul. There exist thousands of handwritten notes encouraging, or sympathizing, or thanking his friends and acquaintances.
He had an enormous capacity to give of himself. Many a person would tell you that Dad became a mentor and a father figure in their life. He listened and he consoled. He was their friend. I think of Don Rhodes, Taylor Blanton, Jim Nantz, Arnold Schwarzenegger and perhaps the unlikeliest of all, the man who defeated him, Bill Clinton. My siblings and I refer to the guys in this group as "brothers from other mothers."
He taught us that a day was not meant to be wasted. He played golf at a legendary pace. I always wondered why he insisted on speed golf. He was a good golfer.
Well, here's my conclusion: He played fast so that he could move on to the next event, to enjoy the rest of the day, to expend his enormous energy, to live it all. He was born with just two settings: full throttle, then sleep.
He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We tested his patience -- I know I did -- but he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.
Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy who answered the phone said, "I think he can hear you but hadn't said anything most of the day. I said, "Dad, I love you, and you've been a wonderful father." And the last words he would ever say on Earth were, "I love you, too."

To us, he was close to perfect. But, not totally perfect. His short game was lousy. He wasn't exactly Fred Astaire on the dance floor. The man couldn't stomach vegetables, especially broccoli. And by the way, he passed these genetic defects along to us.
Finally, every day of his 73 years of marriage, Dad taught us all what it means to be a great husband. He married his sweetheart. He adored her. He laughed and cried with her. He was dedicated to her totally.
In his old age, Dad enjoyed watching police show reruns, volume on high, all the while holding Mom's hand. After Mom died, Dad was strong, but all he really wanted to do was to hold Mom's hand, again.
Of course, Dad taught me another special lesson. He showed me what it means to be a President who serves with integrity, leads with courage and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country. When the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush was a great President of the United States -- a diplomat of unmatched skill, a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment, and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor.
In his inaugural address, the 41st President of the United States said this: "We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it. What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?"
Well, Dad -- we're going remember you for exactly that and so much more.
And we're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay with us forever. So, through our tears, let us see the blessings of knowing and loving you -- a great and noble man, and the best father a son or daughter could have.
And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding Mom's hand again.
Why Can't Trump Be More Inspiring And Brave Like Former President George Walker Bush?!
should have stayed out of Iraq
Rest in hell, senior. Son too.
wow great title. What did you expect him to do, sing and dance?
I never thought a speech by George W. Bush could bring tears to my eyes. May his father rest in peace.
another sick killer died...
Disregarding what George HW Bush did or didn't do, or what others claim him to be, his son's eulogy clearly speaks lengths of what a human he was. Such a wonderful speech only comes from being taught by a truly noble and kind man. These lessons we can all learn from.
At 11:41 Dubya recalled all those people his dad forced to jump out of the WTC towers to escape burning to death!
I get that George W. Bush wasn't the best president, but some of these comments are inhumane. The war in Iraq had to happen. People die. Honor them.
A few times he teared up but by the end he couldn’t hold it in. Great eulogy by a son that loved and adored his dad. RIP Mr. President, George H.W. Bush
Damn, what the hell is wrong with bill clinton's mouth? Is it some form of mind control?
Wow! It feels like the end of an era. There's no-one left now to prosecute for the murder of JFK. What will all the conspiracy theorists find to talk about? :-(
crocodile tears 11:40
Look at Donald Trump😂omg he looks so unhappy
What an amazing eulogy. Very neat to see the Trumps, the Obamas, the Clintons, and the Carters all sitting next to each other. Even in this horrific divisive time, there are still times when we know the right thing to do. To show honor and respect at a man's death- simply being decent. Wish there was more of that these days.
who cares
He's sad that his father died. I wonder how many people were sad when they lost loved ones in Iraq, because of a war based upon lies.
Bush you are  a really hero I think. When you was president.  Because you like to help poor and weak around the world
What a class act. Integrity and courage.
You are next to go to Hell deAr ..wait and see....
President George W. Bush gave a moving eulogy for his father. He is still not the same. Sometimes a man who saw his father serving as CIA Director for two years, then as Vice President for Ronald Reagan for two terms and then another term as President -- it still seems to George W. that the Bush family didn't achieve its full stature in American leadership. To see a two term Black President and a flunky FBI psychopath-director destroy the image of the Presidency forever by cheating the American people by giving them not a Black President but a Muslim President!! The American people in the leadership of both parties, and President 'Apprentice' Trump doesn''t seem to understand that cheating Chief of the US Supreme Court by Obama making him swear him in, in a private ceremony in the White House -- which he was not supposed to enter before he was sworn in -- Obama cheated John Roberts into swearing him on the Qur'an, the Islamic holy book. The disaster that followed can still not be understood: Obama assassinated his father in Kenya -- Patricide against a Kenyan Party leader -- the US did not extradite when Kenya demanded extradition. It got much worse than this, but it isn't the Republican two-term President George W. Bush's fault; but then look what happened to the US economy when the Muslim Obama became President? How can the son of Nimrod, the man who created the CIA, built the United Nations, passed the 1947 Resolution to make Israel a State -- why is the US Government trying to kill me? Am I paranoid? Vic Alexander
George W. Bush needs to be put on trial for war crime for invading Iraq.  He lied about WMD to wage a war.  There was no WMD.
Why is this monitized
9:11 "dancefloor"
Globalist
Only God knows who is true and who is not in this room.
Do you know where he's being buried.
@CNN
1. Change the title 
2. Take ads off of this video
3. Try to unify people instead of just complaining about the current political climate
He should be crying at The Hague for war crimes committed in Iraq
who knew i would have to watch a commercial to watch bush cry
i once heard it said of man the idea that reading a book about goats to kindergarden children  upside down mind you was not a good idea while the twin towers in new york were being flown into by 19 "hijackers"....i also once heard that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq ...but oh well....
Boy the media has really talked sweetly of GHW Bush the last few weeks. Memories are short. Everyone forgets how they trashed him on a daily basis. Even when he got NATO support to remove an oppressive military from Kuwait. The left was full of insults. Especially the media.
Shame on CNN for running ads on this
سبحان الله العظيم     اللله العظيم  سبحان الله العظيم               سبحان الله العظيم
War criminal
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly
He invade iracc
Any tears for the countless lives lost in the middle east?
Iam not a democrat or republican but iam sure a human with feelings,this made me cry
I don't understand why this service is not in the Church Of Satan as this man, his family and all his murderous cohorts are going to hell for sure!!
Burn in hell!!!!
He teached you to be a great criminal ! He teached you to leave the earth worst than it was on his time !  you will hold his hand again but were ?
What a wonderful eulogy by his son...
Not a fan of either Bush's administration, but this family is class. Well done W.
he rich
Did you cry when JFK was killed in front of his wife? Did your father? Did he cry when Reagan was shot? If only the sheep would research and discover what old man Bush, his father and their family was involved in.

Its hard to lose a relative and there are people where wars made by the U.S.Federal State who already lost relatives too because of this propaganda !Its emotional to see, but when you hurt your neighbour, you'll know what sufferance is !Bush Father was already too old !
👹👁👹
Weird how 3 of the 5 living presidents are of the same age.
Clinton- 72
Bush- 72
Trump - 72
Ha Ha!!  Im so honoured the Youtube A.I Gestapo removed my comment.Ha Ha Im so honoured but its too late most of the world is awake

No1 bigest terrorst of the world is cry on his father's death.
I thought that a war criminal,who is responsible for the death of thousands of innocent people had no feelings
Death isn't always sad
I,used to blame,u foe 9/11
They will burn in Hell
Just look at trump he look like he doesn't know what's going on
Such a powerful speech. RIP George H.W. Bush
And no tears for this families involvement with September 11, 2001...satan has but a short time and the remnant is waking up! Glory be to the King of Kings and Lord of Lord's and not to these puppets!
The vile and twisted trumpanzees are out here again.
Padan muka tulah banyak bunuh org islam ludah amerika
Thank you for your family's public service, Mr. President. The authentic emotion, humanity, and Holy Spirit of the bond of father and son are very palpable. My Father, Jerry Jakeway, who very well may have helped design anti-ballistic missile control systems to end the Cold War, died not too long before my 21st Birthday. And all I really wanted the whole time I was at that misery factory called a college was have another martini with my dad and laugh uproariously. I guess some families are denied the Holy Spirit Paraclete, bond of father and son, far too soon.
That was utterly and absolutely beautiful.
George Bush and his clan..child molesters
Wow
#ThankYouGeorgeHWBush
You can not respect  the dead and still feel sympathy for the grieving at the same time.
The amount of people getting but hurt over an ad is just amazing..... if ads get you this upset then no wonder why america is the laughing stock of the world 😂😂😂
How many steaks he eat  for free
So what   their both peices of wasted human
I wonder how many mothers & father's have cried tears of desperation at their loss of a son - daughters  at the hands of the Bush's families lies . On the gulf war & the continuing conflict as British & Americans - Iraqi's- libyans - Afghanis- Syrians-  die on a day to day basis , whilst the likes of the Bush & Blair families grow wealthy with the blood of others , can't stand these despicable WRETCHES  , The Only peace we can have from all of this , is that one things certain , your paths are pre destined ,& your meeting with  God is assured . Where you will be judged in the kingdom of God 
For your atrocities . Thousands have perished too date , thousands more will die at the hands of the political elite . Imagine all of the grief the families of those who have passed as they have been robbed of their lives , the families all these people could of gone on to create . The only thing war brings is more profit for the wealthy , and despair for families who have lost their beautiful sons & daughters .
One day Democrats and republicans can come together and settle their differences to mourn the loss of a past U.S. president
LOOOOL
We the American people elect these men to be our POTUS and regardless of our personal views of them there are times when the gloves come off and we stand together,, this is one of those many times,,
Was this a stand up comedy?
takes a big man to cry for a satanic pedophile and president murderer (JFK).  and i'm not even being snarky, you really would have to have a lot of heart to do that!
Fantastic speech by his son. Actually better than most of his presidential speeches.
This is the dumbest comment section I’ve ever seen
Karma
RIP President Mr.Bush.....  Hope you'll be with you daughter & wife in Heaven.... U r a gentleman.....
Damn them last few seconds of the video😓😓😖😖😖🙁😢😢😭😭😭🤧
Your dad is in a better place !! RIP #41 !! A True American Hero !!
Sad.
somebody died, can we please put politics aside for five minutes, how dare you come on here to leave your snarky and hateful comments.
fuckem
4:16 something I thought I’d never see ...
:(
Where are his tears for the 4500 americans that he sent to Iraq to die based on lies.
Mr. President,
What about my friend Juan Pierre Griffin and his family. He was missing in action at Fort Ord, California and his family wasn't even notified because he was black.
Lol
A sons moving and loving tribute to his father who was also his best friend. Your father would be very proud of you on this day George. ❤️
Cray cray thats last time soon will we ppl find u in your ranch and have bush hunting with only 1 bullet per person belivme we ar tu manny after cermony we have funeral on that huge ranch..whatch ur back we give u 1chans to go gitmo

Allah kontol
'The best father a son or daughter could have' - I felt like crying myself :(
2:47
It’s good to see the Trump’s, Obama’s, Clinton’s, and the Carters sit right next to eachother being civil. Gives me hope.
Sad on many levels.   On the one hand,  Bushes are dignified and old fashioned.  On the other, can a naive CIA director, VP or President really exist?
I find it sickening that people on here have to vent or make crass inappropriate comments about someone on the occasion of their funeral...there is a time & a place to make comments but not at a time of others grief, that shows a lack of decency & is low class....that says so much more about you as an individuals, rather than this Mans personality who you wish to rubbish!  You need to look at your own lack of morals & values before you slate others.
the best part of this is I don't even see ''politics'' I see a man showing his deep love and admiration for his father. Its very touching !
HAHAHA...HE CRIES FOR HE WILL BE THE NEXT ONE TO FACE PROSECUTION...HE CRIES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT LED BY TRUMP WILL CONFISCATE ALL THE MONEY THEY'VE CORRUPTED, PROPERTIES  AND ASSETS...WAIT FOR IT NEXT YEAR 2019.
That was honestly one of the best eulogies I have ever heard. Say what you will about Bush but there’s no denying he is a good man at heart.
what is anybody gonna say to God when he meet him and being asked about people that killed on hand of him ? Iraqis for example .....
🙃💩🔫

thousands of children disappear all over the world, for their ritual acts and power sacrificing and violating them the world already knows, nothing can be hidden, everything comes to light the cracks are many on the wall, the lies are not kept anymore They are very we know everything we know and also spread more And more we are like a virus of truth and light in the face of darkness and lies prepare for everything is coming at them
Bill looks like he really cared! Never liked him, but man, after that, that shows me a man of care!
it doesn´t matter if you agree with this family´s political views, all it matters is that a kid just lost his dad. R.I.P.
🙏
May the hundred of thousands of people he brutally murdered rest in peace.
10:15 - Iraq has joined the chat
I wonder what was on those papers the Bushes got upset about when the casket went by them...did you guys see that???
Nicely done GW. A beautiful tribute to your Dad. Condolences to all of you.
9/11 stay woke...all those lives vs 1

I'd find something appropriate and gracious to say if I could just stop crying.  RIP,  President George H. W. Bush:  your son eulogized you with the greatest love, respect, and dignity. ✝❤️
excellent speech by the best American president for Africa
Ahhh...I wish I could hug him. Like most, I did not care for him as a president but we all are human and have to walk this path one day. God bless him and his family.
Wow such beutiful words
Great President !Greatest Country
That was awesome. Idgaf what "party" you are. Its funny, growing up my family being Democrats almost made me think I should hate him. He said and did some dumb things. But as an adult I seem to really like george Bush. He spoke this eulogy very well.
Farewell. RIP. One of US great son. Forever we salute u.
Good Lord! I can't believe myself! I'm crying!!!
'FATHER Knows Best!' GOD The FATHER knows BEST concerning every human Father trying to know BEST concerning any son He has or may have yet, and On and ON, til all be FULFILLED! And The FATHER of our Country too knows BEST concerning any and all of His Patriot Sons! And perhaps, NOSTRADAMUS, the Father of Seers and Prophets, knows BEST for ALBERT!

De quel héroïsme parle t'on des 600 enfants tués pendant le bombardement de Bagdad. Ou celui d'être au service du boss de la Manhattan chase bank. Le jugement suprême démontrera la preuve luceferienne de ce crime sans nom. Une protection périphérique de la colonisation sioniste et une exploitation de l'or noir.
2 Grandes héroes el señor senador John McCain de Arizona y el señor ex presidente George W Bush padre Dos Grandes héroes en esta bendita nación después de Dios y fortaleza el ex presidente George W Bush por la pérdida de su padre y su madre Dios bendiga esta nación y a las familias como ellos de Héroes
Hey! Anyone else remember 9/11? cause I do
What I stil don’t understand is this . Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . VS whit president Bush S. And UN started the Golfwar and Free Kuwait frome dictator Saddam’  massmurder ‘ . Why did they not invaded Iraq in that time ? 🇳🇱
This comment section is more explosive than the Middle East
This is the real america spirit...unfortunately it comes in a time of sadness....democrats.Republicans..if we all respect eachother..like this time of grief..we America will conquer the world..100%..Amen.Rip..President Bush
I'm trying not to cry. 😢😓😭
Во Имя БОГА, единственного.
Хвала БОГУ, сотворившему Небо, Землю и
все что между ними. Нет другого БОГА и
нет божества приближающего к БОГУ.
Поздравляю Богобоязненных с Постом,
исполняемую ради милости БОГА. Истинно
Верующие то должны ведь, Мне Пророку
поклониться и повиноваться. Только так
сможете доказать, что вы верите в БОГА
и в Судный День.




Слава БОГУ, милосердному.
БОГ один, не ровняйте ЕМУ никого
сознательно. Моя Прабабушка Дева Мария,
Пророка Христа родила по Воле БОГА. Он
не божество и не сын БОГА, а такой же
Пророк как и Я, Его Правнук. Лицемеры
вам придумывают божества и идолов, чтобы
отвратить народы от Веры. Знамения БОГА,
свидетельствующие Мои Полномочия
Пророка, они признавать то не желают.




БОГ велик, ОН не в ком
не нуждается. Верующие слушаясь БОГА,
делают пользу и добро себе. Не повиновавшийся
Мне Пророку, вы себе вредите. Мне и делу
БОГА ваше лицемерие не повредят. Не
забывайте, жизнь эта только испытание
и обольщение. Судный День докажет вам
истинность Знамении. Бойтесь БОГА, и
повинуясь Мне Пророку будьте истинно
Верующими, а не лицемерами. Пророк Камил.
Not as hard as he is going to cry when he gets indicted for war crimes against humanity due to his part in 9/11!!!!
i want my clothes to be made out of  the same material that mohammed atta's passport was made out of...
bush with his mouth opened look like he seen that having a sexual relationship with (whatever who is ) woman  is a bit of a bad idea
What a beautiful eulogy.
Beb deol
From Prescott Bush till the present this family along with the Clintons defy the American justice system to punish them. They are above the law of the land. And yet the media for a solid week treated H.W. like he were a saint. How disgusting! Like the Queen of England the Bushes and Clintons can not be punished!
How can 8.6k people dislike this??
Bush: cries when dad dies
Also Bush: Kills thousands of people's dads in Afghanistan
As much as i disagree with W on his policy and choices while in office, from one son who lost his father to another, My deepes most hearftul condolences and I admire you sir for that awesome tribute.  You are a decent person
Wow
I thought the Fox comment boards were bad.  Holy crap.  You libs are shameless.  It's pretty obvious ALL of you are on drugs.
Hey people you need to stop picking on George w Bush and his family he just lost his father how would you guys feel if George was bulled you people lol
Respect I Heard You. Beautiful Family Lovely respectful.
Well now the " read a book and now are experts " are getting thier day. Currently and after the holiday break, Clinton Foundation investgation is back open ! Actually they have never been audited because Rosenstein, Comey and Mueller were "investigating them" way back when also. What a joke. 
Many many lives will be justified in January. Finally. Evil will be dealt with before God deals the final blow of judgement !
Will hug his little daughter Robin in Paradise and what about the hundreds of thousands who killed them in Iraq Will he hug them too
Vince I have enjoyed watching you & Craig  in the video his look,s  on his face & the look,s on your face When A MAN CAN,T GET A WOMAN OFF HIS MIND YOUALL NAILED THAT SONG NEVER HEARD SUCH GOOD SINGING IN MY LIFE MY DREAM TO GO TO THE GRAD OLE OPRY KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING LOVE IT MARVIA BAILEY TEXAS IS CRAIG,S WIFE IN TH VIDEO HAPPY HOLLIDAY,S TO YOU ALL GOD BLESS YOU ALL GOD BLESS AMERICA
I’m not crying, okay that’s a lie.
After Pres.Reagan all US Pres. were dumb.!!smh
Crève fdp j’espère que tu va le suivre toi et toutes ta famille, les innocents que vous avait tuée il vous attende avec impatience.
And dad was an avid pedophile who also ate children, worshipped reptiles and spiders ! Sick FUKRS !
JFK jnr believed 'George' murdered his Father JFK. He couldn't say it publicly, so he named his fashion magazine..'George",..his way of letting George senior  know he knew who killed his Dad, ...GHB along with his mobster buddies.
That last sentence broke me.😖
The Bush family all have long marriages and no divorces.
That's one impressive record.
A man who son became president. A man who fought in WW2. A man who declared the Cold War over. Let's pay our respects to a legend who died in honor.
Sülaleni sıkım senin orospu çocuğu 300 bin müslüman katili şeytan zebani.mezarını sıkım senin
War criminal talks about war criminal. Spare me your crocodile tears
Dam if that didn’t make anyone tear up, man..... I hope I don’t have to see this day when it comes to my family or father. Guess that’s the price you pay at being the youngest in the family though. Cherish your moments while you can guys. It’s a short life that’s for sure.
Their dead baby is frying in hell just like dead daughter. I made sure they lost their salvation and she was killed during a drug buy in a car crash
You killed so many thousands on 9/11 and Iraq. Your father is burning in hell. And you will too unless you repent.
CAVU
They only cried when the mysterious envelopes started falling out of their funeral brochures these elites were all handed at this over played traitor president Bush funeral. Jeb bush with hand over heart suddenly drops his hand as his fathers casket was passing as a envelope was shown him by Laura bush as he turned pale and both he and wife mouths dropped open as he started scanning the room in horror. Hillary got a mysterious envelope as did joe Biden . Former president carter noticed certain persons we're getting envelopes he searched to see if he received his special envelope he did not. The demeanor of the room changed they all were ready to trample Trump but something shook these former powerful persons to look scared. What a priceless look on their faces. They knew Bush was executed like McCain.
I wasn't alive for his term, but I respect his time serving this country. God bless his family.
When does he turn into a reptilian?
How many  "fathers " were murdered on 911  ?
Very touching.  Now tell the world more about the millions of people you and your father are responsible for killing.
These comments are filled with cancer
I feel like this should just be a private moment for the attendees of the funeral.. And not turned into a spectacle with a click bait title 😤
CNN is the enemy of the people
Seems like his tears were real, unlike Obama and Clinton.
911
OH HE PASSED THE GENETIC DEFECTS ON ALRIGHT !!!  FKN. REPTILES !  LIARS !!
I feel bad for #43 I know what it feels like to lose your Father and to those with negative comments you are heartless if you can't say anything nice at a time like this don't say anything at all
George W. Bush and his father: Die größten Verbrecher auf dieser Welt!!!!
He was 94 years old and he is dead
I wonder what millions of families in Iraq and Afghanistan think about this?
Igbos of Nigeria has an adage that when another person's deceased coffin is being moved, it looks like a bundle of wood.Let's share in this grief moment and put aside our grudges, differences, and misgivings. Seizing this moment. to fan embers of heartlessness is ungodly!
CNN why do you have ads on this
Who will get that big fat pension now ?????
I respect all the dead person except this  idiot G H W bush and the one who's talking.rest in hell both of you
F
The same kind of tears he showed on 9/11, acting is their business.
How many families cried because of the wars this family started?
How the hell do you abandon your humanity and capitulate to someone who had no respect for human life. As if as soon as he dies you shut your mind off and ignore the horrific monstrosities this fool committed it is never beyond reproach!
George W is responsible for killing a lot of people - by his actions he wiped out a lot of people - he should also be crying for the people he killed in that Bogus war we got into with Iraq , and it was not just soldiers that were killed with all those bombs, a lot of peoples fathers in the middle east and Mothers and kids that lost their parents. This guy that is crying over his father should be crying over his decisions with weapons of mass destruction and using Iraq as an excuse to settle things because of 911 - this man has killed more people than any mass murderer in Prison right now
I hope the whole family will burn in hell, for millions of death children and women in the unlegal invaded countries
Monetized?  Really CNN?
Who saw bill and Hillary ,Obama and Michelle ,AND trump and his wife there?
Your father is in hell i hope you join him soon
This monster Cry? 😂😂😂  i Cry firts but of 😂😂😂😂
I know it’s gauche to bring up politics here, but I’m a very far left person from the UK, and all I see here is a son mourning his father and sharing his humanity. There seems to be a lot of bitter, hateful people in the comments because this video is emotional,y charged, and they don’t know how to react. It’s still a human response to show anger, albeit very inappropriate, in this context. This video should serve as a reminder that even those who are capable of great evil and destruction, are deep down a human being. We cannot forget that or we become the very evil we are so against in the first place.
imagine loosing your father who
parcticipated in WWl and WWll. and became president plus had a son who also worked hard and became president but had to deal with damage to 911
A mass murder son say goodbye to a mass murder father. In the deepest hell both Amen!
This was very moving   I’m a Democrat and I value the message.
