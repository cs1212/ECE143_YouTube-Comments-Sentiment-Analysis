That’s one happy man😂. Good for them for doing it their way.  He’s got the girl and he’s got his boy now. Good for him.
Great another Royal tax Leach.
Harry great fool from red hair father and a mother who did unsuitable things near by her death.
God bless the three of them ❤️❤️❤️

Prince Harry is a stallion !!  And his wife will improve the royal gene pool considerably.
Blessings to Baby Sussex!
Congrats Harry 🎉👍
LOL...prince Ninger...
The things the monarchy does to appease the money lenders and ignorant sacrificial peasants.
Good riddance.
CONGRATS TO HARRY & MEGHAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats both of you
I wish Diana is alive to Withness this day, I love those boys  humility.
I doubt Harry will accept a patron of Prince. If the baby is a Prince then he will have to lead the Royal life. I think he will want as private a life as he can for his children. Remember he hates the press after what happened with Diana. He will still be an Earl.
Imagine.... 
Europeans left England to escape aristocracy and here you have them fawning over everything the Royals do.... 😂😂😂
Typical American behavior.
He got the horses in the back 😂😂😂
CNN... Its not Meghan of Sussex! Lool its Meghan... Duchess of Sussex!
Wow today is my birthday
Well, the British tabloid have not been kind to hear at all and they talk about us in the US being racist.   The UK is 87% white and many over there are not very welcoming of people from their former colonies.  Just ask Indians, Pakistanis, and Jamaicans among others.  

Best wishes to the new parents and keep the media at arms length (at least the British).
He looks so happy.
It’s a happy beginning. Congratulations to the trio Sussex. Best news for this decade!!!
Shocked i thought it was a girl  HARRY xx
Happy for you. 💕❤️🇺🇸
oh my.
Mes felicitations Prince Harry et Meghan. Depuis New Jersey
Prince Harry's smile says it all! He is such a proud Papa and could hardly contain his exuberance during his announcement earlier today...we are all excited and happy for the proud parents of baby Sussex! 👍 Can't wait to see them pushing him around in his stroller, or Dad walking around with his son strapped to his torso in a baby carrier enjoying the safe grounds and protections of Frogmore Cottage where there is plenty of space and tons of Security to protect them against the jealous haters and the crazies! May God bless them always!!!! Good job Mom and Dad!!!!🌹
Congratulations!!
Honest question...
Why is this being reported to us as news?
Gefeliciteerd Megan & Harry,met mooie boy.God's rijke zegen!!!.
This little thing hmm 🤔
No more lies love Harry!
CNN first post how black will the royal baby be. Disgusting network.
Congratulations
Baby sponger has arrived
Congratulations to Harry’s half-caste son
Another royal parasite
Still haven't heard about them returning what was stolen from Africa.
I'm so happy for them!!!  Harry is beaming !!!!!! May they have a long  happy life , filled with so much joy !!!
Congratulations!
Harry and Meghan are a unique couple and deserve the absolute best. Their good people. Best wishes to their family.
Lmao so why was YouTube saying twins?
Awww....healthy baby!💙🌈🐼🐷🐻🐯🐶🐵
Congrats to the surrogate.
Who gives a rat's a**
That Baby Boy is going to be one good looking baby ;0)
Congrats.  Royals aren't special.  They are the same as everyone else.
Spercer
What an awesome day......Congratulations to the Sussex Family.....💙💙💙💙💙💙
Cannot wait to see this little bundle of joyousness!!
Coongs!!!
How this make Orange man bad?   We need CNN for #1 best Orange man bad propaganda.
Only now is AmeriKKKa proud of Meghan.  She had to move to Canada to be successful and lived here for many years.
Congratulations to duke and duchess of Sussex
❤❤❤❤❤
So exciting
I just don't get it.  What does the royal Family do again?  I mean to deserve the privilege they born with?  Please explain?  That's one hell of an expensive national symbol.
Being a parent is the biggest joy!
A baby is a blessing. Many will not know how it feels to have a child. Yet, some of you are leaving vile comments. No wonder the world is in such turmoil; so much hate instead of empathy & compassion for others!
So this family gets a free ride for life and for their descendants because...???
Salute!!😄
"Gleams"? Weird adjective to use.
There's an awful lot of inbred breeding in the Royal family & its nice to see that they are starting to expand their gene pool finally!
Awww ....
NOW THIS IS REAL NEWS.
CONGRASUATIONS PRICE HARRY PRINCESS MEGHAN 🎈🎈🎈🎈
NO ONE REALLY CARES ANYMORE WHAT ENGLAND DOES NOW THAT DIANA IS NO LONGER WITH US....THE MAGIC AND LOVE IS GONE

How do they know it’s a boy?
They should name the boy Tyrone.
He was lovely on jealous and selfish  people put thumps downs on a special  occasion.  I don't care who he is but birth is a wonderful  experience  . Love to you and you new family.
I wonder if Grampa Markle will get a look in
Amazing news :)
I care as much about his child as he cares about mine.
I usually could care less about this royal stuff,  but I'm genuinely happy for them. God bless them.
Megan 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹👌👍
Love!! 👪 Nothing like the love of a child and parents...❤❤❤
That's the mullato one right?
The look on Harry's face says it all!  He is one proud Papa. Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess.  Welcome to the world Baby Sussex.  Wishing them God's blessings.
Wow i bet that baby is Japheth, Shem, and Ham. Is this the return of Nimrod he was described as being a leopard. The line of all three. Have the freemason got their prophesied King Arthur?
great …….
Just what we need to concentrate on royal children. This is definitely something we need to know about. Keep in mind it’s super rich elite like this who will survive when global warming destroys everything else. We should be having less children. Overpopulation is one of the worst things happening right now that is not mentioned at all.
HiZoo.com
A million love,happiness and joy to the most popular DMaghan and P Harry and indeed D Meghan deserve this happiness at that barrage of attack from her awful family not to mention the racists evils of those hatets losers, many,many good will may go to all and happiness to the new Ma DMeghan and Pa PHurry well done and carry on marching with mighty and high y are indeed a gallants 2
Congratulations!!! But by at a backyard.. at the stables? That is a great news, isn't it? and... what women??? not your wife??? and why you are so tense???

🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔👈👈👈💕👄
Who cares? These people are strictly propaganda
Duck
I blame Donald Trump for this!
I feel bad for the british presenters having to work on a public holiday lol
Yay!
Wonderful Harry and Meghan, The Best To You as a Family.........
Finally all the rumormongers can settle down and find some new idiocy to obsess over. Congrats to the new parents.
I thought that if you could have only one nationality in the US, and since Meghan has requested the British Nationality, that means she will have to give up her US nationality, so there won’t be a double nationality, right?or is there a double standard in the US?
I think Baby sussex has big brown eyes and red hair:))
No Gods our kings down with Royalty
Monday's child is fair of face . .   Congrats! Can't wait to see pictures!
2,00,000 Americans dying every year because of fentanyl crisis...and 🇺🇸govt doing nothing....😎😎😎😎
More babies......I hope.
Congrats! American prince with a black granny. I love it 🥰
Well, well ,her beloved father gave a note of congratulation with swallowed pride, and wish them Grace which he did not show towards the Daughter not to mention for the Queen or the Royal family , honour and he indeed showed lack side of it towards his beloved daughter  and duty indeed as a father he did not showed an honour of that side when blubber mouthed all over  the paper that pays him,  sad to say Old man good y have a big mouthed daughter  go and embrace her and your other grandchildren and show them your love this Grandson won't your love nor your advice.
Wow people have baby's everyday . So she had a baby stop localizing these people theres nothing special about it. Like f .
let's hope lefts will not ruin his gender. Peoples in CNN are insane
Another Leacher on British taxpayers' money.
thst is such a lie ... all my british friends. tell me they do not like her at all and they never support her .... i even said why ? it’s obvious he loves her ... 
it’s absolutely a lie that the brits love her ... lying to the cameras shame shame ... 
he loves her so they need to get over it
Illuminati news
Wow if they had a home birth they went back to tradition. The  Queen had all four of her children at home. Thumbs up for Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan for following in the footsteps of the Queen
Congratulations Harry and Meghan on the birth of your baby boy. I love you. 
 Lots of kisses  to your baby..
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😇😇
Harry married who she loved and wanted William marriage who he loved and wanted and now we await the future of the kids and their personality and what type of princesses a prince a Duke the kids will be no one knows the title of the baby yet and if the baby will have a title so I just can't wait to see the personalities of the children what they going to be like because Harry is rambunctious Megan is outspoken so I translate the personality of children might come right out in the kids so your mother always says don't wish for what will happen your kids will end up just like you
Who cares!
FAKE NEWS it's a girl
Thank Godboth mother and baby boy are doing well after the birth!  I'm overjoyed for them.  Love this couple!  Love and congrats from the USA🇱🇷💐❤❤💋👣👑💏
Hi bigots. 👋
Lol a home birth was the tradition lol they had their own royal obstetrician, QEII even had his cancer surgery performed in Buckingham Palace.
Well at least history didn’t repeat itself.  Charles broke Diana’s heart when upon seeing Harry said “oh God it’s a boy (with disappointment in his voice) and look he’s even got red hair.”  Harry always wanted more siblings and later always wanted kids.  He is very proud of Meghan and his new baby boy and it shows.  Hopefully they will be a happy family.  Something his Mother and Father weren’t able to do because of the Camilla “third wheel” Charles valued over all else.
Wow 😍😍 england has a wonderful future. So happy for them. England is an example of tolerance and multiculturalism.
Congs to Harry and Meghan from Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👶🏼👶🏼👶🏼😘😘😘
so many comments no one will know im gay
Are those people even going to read these comments???
It's coverage like this that inspired me to start subscribing to Democracy Now and the Intercept.
I knew it would be a boy💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 welcome baby Sussex!!!!!!
Royal trash having another demon seed
and the Tonight Show baby watch is ended
I think the burden is over for him and all those who felt responsible for him his brother felt a deep sense of Burden and responsibilities looking after him feeling bad he should be the big brother and you should listen to him so when Harry does little mischievous antics he feels shame for his brother and he feels disappointed but now how he is a grown man he's married I'm a little bit of the attention is still on Harry because now Harry has married an American he is married mixed race and he has married quickly and now this baby has taken its wonderful time which I believe it is a home birth because usually takes that long for home birth and the baby is taking the tension so you know there's a lot of Envy on his big brother side but at the same time I know his big brother's probably happy for him but how he has handled it's in a much different way I am happy for her and and Duchess Meghan I am happy for them she's a strong independent woman and he needs that balance now it's time for the big brother to find his footing and his own Journey his personality now needs to come out because I signed William is a bitch pull back when it comes to his personality so he needs to find his own footing and I wish them the best and I am happy baby Sussex is here it's a boy it's a boy it's a boy
The majority of people in England don't care so why would we?
we shouldnt even have kings queens or princes anymore, come on folks those days are over lol
Who cares!!!!!!

#CNNSUCKS
Harry and Meghan did well. They had a healthy baby boy on their terms. Congratulations to them both.  (Believe it  or not people had babies before hospitals and doctors.) You go Meghan and Harry!!!
Harry looks exactly as James Hewitt I am sure the baby will something like Harry.
CONGRATULATIONS PRINCE HARRY. YOUR ARE A FATHER NOW! WELCOME BABY SUSSEX !  MEAGHY YOU ARE OUR PRINCESS. THE PRINCESS OF THE HEART, THE PRINCESS OF THE WORLD! GOD BLESS YOU, YOUR COUPLE AND YOUR BABY SUSSEX. GOD BLESS THE ONE WHO ALLOWED THIS EXTRAORDIBARY UNION  AND THEN THIS BABY. GOD BLESS THE QUEEN OF UK. I LOVE YOU MEAGHY , PRINCE HARRY AND BABY SUSSEX. MY FAVORITES.  PEACE AND LOVE FROM MAYOTTE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.
This what every woman on the planet would want. A man like Harry who showers his wife and child with so much love, especially at a time like that.
If Diana was alive, mm would not be in the RF.  The pillow burst.
1 more parasite ~ we have to pay for ~~~~~~~~~~~~ london uk
James Hewitt must be cuffed with news of his first grandchild.
I am the baby's daddy!
LETS PRAY the socialist dont try to turn the boy into a girl at 5 years old...
Glad he's a Taurus😃
Careful calling him boy.. advice from the colonies.
Who cares?
Harry is a beta male... and no we won't pay for your family.
Harry is a dope.  He was used by this Narcissist, Meghan, for his wealth, notoriety and social connections.  Just look how she hooked him with the quick pregnancy  "Anchor baby".  It will be a life of hell with her.....so sad!
MEN CAN'T HAVE BABIES! 100% HOAX!!!
Congratulations from Ghana on the birth of baby Sussex. The British were  our colonial masters we still have alot in common.  And mama Sussex has brought a big joy to the whole Africa continent we love you Meghan as our sister  And Harry as our in-law.
Wooo Baby Boy? Did they just assume that babies gender? Like slow down, it's 2019! Let the baby be fluid and pick 🚼
#fvckCNN
#fvckPrinceHarry
#BERNIE2020
This mug is a shapeshifting reptilian!! That baby is a mix breed human and reptilian but he can still shapeshift ya'll mugs better get WOKE like me and open up that third eye!!
This Brit can't understand what all the bloody fuss is about; he was one of 366,000 children born worldwide today. 


Why is the entire world lining up to kiss the Royal Family's arse!?
Dont care about the biggest welfare usurpers known as the royals, how about the british citizens theyve sucked dry to have such luxury. Not surprising that the welfare of the elites is important to CNN enemy of the people
This non story is so GAY it's caused me to puke in my mouth causing my tooth enamel to decline.
Hey look! It's Prince Harry and What's her Name!
The baby is 1/3 black, would you call him a nigglet?
New baby boy on board people 🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🚶🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏂🏄🏄🏄🏄🏄🏄🏄🚵🚵🚵🚵🚵🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏍🏍🏍🏍🏍🏍⛷⛷⛷⛷🏂🏂🏂🏂🚴🚴🚴🚴🚴🚣🚣🏌🏌🏌🏌🏌🏌🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌😘😘🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👏👏👏❤❤❤
Great Britain! Your King Baby sucks like no other baby in the entire 

history of humankind! 

What an ugly baby! Lobster Boy! Use it for a pinata! 
What I want to know is what happened to the Royal After Birth ... the Holy 

Placenta?

Did they jest discard it... into which bin? Something like that could be 

worth a lot of money on the international market... or did they cook it up and eat it up... a royal raconteur delicacy. lol



Sorry... but as an American I feel it my patriotic duty to tell all royalty 

to go straight to hell.
Can we talk about Black their wedding was!! She's the Beyonce of Royalty!!!
Another entitled POS the world has to babysit.
Another parasite on the British Taxpayer.
She doesn’t have american citizenship. She forfeit her citizenship when she became a duchess. Noble or royal titles are not recognized within the American federal republic.
Britain in turmoil, and this is news.
Just another royal parasite .
Megan is actually a man and this isn’t a real baby. Fake pregnancy
Believe me You don't feel successful until you get married and make a Family❤.
🌹 Talk about a Genetic Lottery!!!!

Queen Elizabeth is a descendant of MOHAMMED. Prince Phillip is a descendant DRACULA. And they're GERMAN! They're PURE RH NEGATIVE relative Tsarina Alexandria was "mysteriosly assasinated." So enter Diana, an Oriphim, and not only PURE RH NEGATIVE BLOOD LINE, but ALSO a LEGITIMATE line to a Jacobian Scottish king.

And NOW...... American, Native American (also Scot, if West Cherokee) hopefully a dash of Nubian/Egyptian and Egyptian/Irish..... topped with a sprinkling of Gaelic/Camelot that pre-dates Columbus............. POSITIVE EUGENICS AT IT'S FINEST!!!!

After she pops out a few, if she doesn't conform...... be watching for another mysterious car crash in some obscure tunnel!!!
Congratulations to the new Parents. Who could thumbs down this so evil smh.
Is his name Sir Tyrone Dindu Da IV?
If there's a riff between William & Harry, I hope this brings them together
I'll never understand why Americans care so much. They have no political power and not even half of Britain cares.
Once again we the British Taxpayers will have to pay for this Royal Inbred, the sooner we rid of these Benefit Scroungers the better.
Who cares?
This is "BREAKING NEWS" . . . why?  Because the "family" is entitled for no reason at all.
The Grandfather will be so pleased.


Has anyone seen James Hewitt lately?
what a Islamophobic people
Please CNN, just report on this happy moment and birth for the Sussex's 😍.  Don't drag up painful past involving death and other sad stuff!
The Anti-Christ is born......
They should abort their son
Who cares? Millions of kids are born every day. Why is this kid special?
I am extremely happy with the three of them.
Why is still this a news? King,prince,queen..oh come on for fuck's sake don't you have other important things to cover
sambo
Again cnn is fake news, how in the world is this breaking news?
Get ready for a blackie. It will be named Mambutu Wakanda Kush III.
Kill it before it grows.
A gingergroid it's like a unicorn
A royal chimp................Hahahahahaahahahaahahahaahahahahahahaahahhahaahahah
Son? thought it was a genderless theybie.
