So many people going to be homeless along with pets & scared stray animals .
So sad to watch this devastation .🙏🙏
Seems the tax money from cannabis legalization would come in handy.
I feel for these people. I am from Trinidad and we had a horrible earthquake a few weeks ago. I said that I preferred a Hurricane to an earthquake because at least you get a warning for the hurricane. With the earthquake you get no warning. After seeing this. I don't prefer any of them.  This is so sad. So much disaster all over the world and yet people still continue to be unkind and hurt and harm people. When will we learn to live in peace? I pray that anyone who is experiencing any type of pain or discomfort due to this will get a speedy relief. I am sorry for the helpless animals. Scared, cold and hungry and don't understand what is happening.
This is why I will never move to Florida, there is literally a hurricane every year
There's a kid in my school named Michael he stormed out of school yesterday
All employees make sure you park company vehicles under the hotel's driveway roof! We upgraded to full coverage while saving 5% by switching to Geico!
Praying for all that are affected
My thoughts and prayers for everyone in Florida and everyone who lost their homes in Hurricane Michael thoughts and prayers from New Jersey may God be with you and may God keep you strong y'all are going to rebuilt from this.# Florida strong. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Another huge tax cut for the wealthy will fix all  this in no time
Sooooo is this a turning point of how we build buildings near the ocean.   Seems like EVERYTHING needs to be tied down and also what about power lines???  Do we need to find a better way to build power lines so that they are protected during major storms???
Also why aren't the windows hurricane proof,,  if you live near the ocean it should be in building codes..so much destruction..ya know the trees do the most damage ,so what next????
Dear Precious One, it is so important for you to know that we ALWAYS have our Lord Jesus Christ's attention and that His strength brings confidence, security and protection to those whom loves Him. Jesus cares so much about you and wants you to ALWAYS come to Him in prayer. Thankfully, we know God responds to us. He is the “Most High,” the “Almighty” (Psalm 91:1). His position is exalted and His power is limitless, yet He is accessible to us. God invites: “Call upon Me, and I will answer” (v. 15 nkjv).     

An ancient legend tells of a monarch who hired weavers to make tapestries and garments for him. The king gave the silk and the patterns to the weavers with the strict instructions to seek his aid immediately if they had any difficulties. One young weaver was happy and successful while the others were always experiencing trouble. When the boy was asked why he was so successful, he said, “Didn’t you notice how often I called for the king?” They replied, “Yes, but he’s very busy, and we thought you were wrong in disturb him so frequently." The boy answered, "I just took him at his word, and he was always happy to help me!"  Our Savior Jesus Christ is like that King - only much MUCH greater. He is loving and kind enough to care about our smallest concerns and faintest whisper.    

Never EVER be afraid to call upon the Lord because He truly cares. Call upon Him by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be secured and justified in salvation. You will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed.❤️❤️❤️      

Please find comfort in praying the following prayer with me....Dear Lord Jesus, it is amazing to me that You, my Lord and Savior and Father God who created the universe, care about me and want me to come to You in prayer, thank you for loving me so much. This I pray to the honor and glory of Your name Jesus Christ. Amen! May Father God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ!
I LOVE it when I hear about Hurricanes BLASTING red states into OBLIVION! It makes me HAPPY!    :  )
Lets let the stricken residents of Northern Florida recover and rebuild without the usual sanctimonious lecturing about global warming.
Rebuild so mother nature can do it all over again!
I would like to know why you guys don't build your homes out of concrete the damage would not be so severe because where I am we do not build houses out of wood and in 2017 we had the most powerful storm came true and that was Hurricane Irma my country got a direct hit and I had no damage to my home
Wow that's just amazing. I'm pray that everyone out in those areas made it through the storm. We got fires and earthquakes out here in the west,  but a massive storm like that affects more people in a short period of time.
😢😢 Its sad people , we went through this and the aftermath its worst.   Now you guys have a idea of what we going true after last year Category 5 Hurricane in P.R.  Thanks God the hurricane when fast and now is time to get united and work together to rise again.   Hopefully the guy on the White House sends the help and when they arrive the do the best they can to help the survivors of this horrible experience in Florida.   God bless you all.
Americans make houses extremely cheap
, it’s time to use cement like poor countries .
THAT'S A LOTTA DAMAGE!

yeh I said it.
Why is there so many hurricane happening in such close time frame? Gosh what a way to lower the human population in short time. God help us all 😔
Actually, Hurricane Andrew was the strongest at cat 5 in the 90s.
Just another regular day in Florida, back to business soon
The footage they captured was intense.
oh my god my grandpa lives in florida i hope he went somewhere😭
Prayed for some this's affected!
Good get rid of all those insane Florida men I keep hearing about on the news
I was in Florida yesterday!! It wasn't like this 🙄wtf
did someone say hurricane? imma send prayera so everything gets fixed instead of donating food.
Comments need to be Disabled.
Eventually climate change is going to make Florida uninhabitable. But somehow I doubt even this storm is going to convince anyone in the hurricane zone to reduce their carbon footprint. It will be business as usual.
O my god 
It was really crazy ...
Was almost a category five wow
Poor family's that lost there family's
"NOW THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE"
I feel so bad for the people in Florida. I wish I could help!!😭
“Hurricanes tearing up your city? Spray it with Oxy Clean and it’s good as new” Billy Mays
How is he standing or is it Photoshop?
Remind me to never move to Florida. Geesh.
This too shall pass. God speed and good luck
Wow!   And we think our tornado's in the Midwest are bad.
Hurricanes are only the beginning. We can all look forward to watching Florida slowly sink over the next few decades as sea levels rise.😎
Jeeeeez loouuuuiiiiise!!! 

Prayers for all the people who are suffering. 

Crazy weather is happening right across the solar system.
Reporter please go inside, debris flying at that speed can be deadly;  ... The history it's not worth it men, stay safe

Start using steel and concrete to build and you guys will manage  a little bit better wtf with all the wood housing? be wise.
where is yasuo's windwall when you need it
😢🙏👼 prayers for all affected by this unfortunate tragedy. 💨
It had already been hit by not a category 4 but 5 in 1935
SINCE 2017!! DUDE  HARVEY WAS TERRIBLE!!

But I pray for those in Florida, Georgia, AND PLEASE DO NOT CAUSE MORE DESTRUCTION!!
cheap construction. that roof saved you from flying debris. coming through the glass lobby entranceway. it was a blessing.
Storms like this will continue to get worse if we dont do anything about climate change now. Im so sick of people denying it and saying that it isnt real when its literally happening before our eyes.
When u name a hurrricane micheal
U gonna have the moves of Micheal
The punch of Mike tyson

This is feeding frenzy for reporters.
Stay dry and safe Florida people.
this is so sad 😣  sending prayers 🙏
Hey Florida
M I C H A E L  H E R E
“Rips roof off building”... shows carport tipping over...
Hurricanes: we dont mean to make damage! Plus, its not like we can go to the same place!

Also hurricanes:
So Harvey and Micheal were category 4's, Houston gets murdered and now yall. Damn
Florida will eventually just get submerged into the gulf.
We need to keep them in ur prayers 🙏
Prayers sent..
I wish I  could come and help.
Days of Elijah. Don't divide His Land.
Wow watching this I get flashbacks from Maria it was exactly like this wow I hope everyone stay safe
God bless everyone. I'm praying for yall.
So sad 😞 I was there 2 months ago. Prayers
A great concert of Michael Jackson - shake, shake
I hope everyone stays safe.
The US can afford the loss...

Imagine what happened to poor little Puerto Rico.
Take a shot everytime he says "familys"
i wonder what excuse the insurance companies will come up with not to pay claims ...
FLORIDA DESERVES IT LMAO
Hell yeah! I hope it devastated my cousins life to shambles.
Prayers and peace for the wonderful people in the Florida panhandle. Hope native son Jimmy Buffett can do some concerts in the area to lift the peoples' spirits during the cleanup efforts.
Adult me feels for those who live in that area and little boy me is like "Cool! Destructionnnn!!"
stop building cardboard houses
I'm gonna leave a like on this video
yeah but according to repubs climate change isn't man made and is not an important issue lol Vote them OUT!
Throw them some paper towels
Thanos is coming. None of us are safe.
Just another MAN made STORM.
-_-
prayers for family❤
Geo-engineered storm directed at Americas red state    Hope and prayers to all of you to stay safe
Welcome to the End Times..
Incredible footage.  So, so sad.
This is not the power of human  but it's the power of The Mightiest God. The weakest human is helpless
May God bless everyone
Without power goes without saying. That’s the least of your worries during a major hurricane. 🤦‍♂️
Thanks ABC, great coverage, very brave reporting! Stay safe guys and girls, God be with you!
Jesus Christ it’s not hurricane micheal it’s hurricane micheal Phelps
Jiren Powering Up!!!
Told yall to evacuate.
I will it what is going on on YouTube incredible
Support
Not global warming & NOT mother nature. IT'S THE US GOVERNMENT
And this is why we need Donald Trump to build a wall





This is a joke prayers to people suffering from the hurricane
Omg damn I feel so sorry for these people gonna be praying for them all!
Why would you go to the highest floor in the hotel?
He said stunning and apocalyptic in one sentence, repent you guys god promise he wouldn’t bring another flood,but that is definitely a warning ⚠️ 
 I pray for all the families that are suffering🤦🏾‍♀️🙌🏾🙏🏽
Hurricane, disaster, families-families-families-families, apocalyptic. 

Hotel roof collapse? More like Check -In parking area roof, yes?
I don’t understand how people can’t move trees but storms can but storms can’t move people
Praying for you all.
Awesome coverage by David Muir!  Thank you. Be safe!
Maybe its time to move out 
..... out of Florida
Stand Your Ground Florida.... Shoot That
I was just here for my anniversary August 13th. This is insane. 💔
I have family in panama city so I been anxious sincei heard it was going to hit and they lost power so I haven't been able to get ahold of any of them
This seems to be the most raw Micheal Footage.  Stunning. This news crew took too much of a risk
Now that's allot of damage!
Global warming?
My prayers from Puerto Rico 😔😓 I've been in that situation and it's horrible
Hard to believe this is in the same state as me. Here in South Florida we haven't experienced anything.
🇺🇸DON'T TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE 🇺🇸
This is "fake news".
Prayers for these people. 

My friends, The Lord Yeshua is arriving soon! 

The Lord loves us! 
It is written that God so loved the world, He gave us His only Begotten Son Yeshua, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John  paraphrased)

This is why He came down from heaven to die in our place! He rose again the 3rd day, and has assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

I pray you all accept this Wonderful Gift from God today by making Him Lord of your life! He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him! So don’t let anyone or anything stop you from coming to Yeshua today. 

All you need is faith as a mustard seed and sincere words from your heart. 

He will hear you, make you new, deliver you from your sins and from the judgement headed to this earth. 

For all those that call upon the Name of The Lord shall be saved! (Romans )
These kind of storms will become more and more common as the effects of climate change become more prevalent.
I never find your loveing
Instead of sending thoughts and prayers, why dont you help fight climate change instead that will help wayy more.
Hmm.. Something is not right. Two hurricanes in a short period of time? Climate change seems to be speaking violently.
Maybe we are waking the anger of Gods, or maybe we are suffering hoax consequences of playing Gods.
climate change is not real isn't..?
Solid reporting. Well done.
Michael goodness gracious
Damn Flordia is getting destroyed.
Help I’m here with my sister we’re scared I don’t have food pray for me
Damn this ting just passed me. Good luck and stay strong yall. Sadly the season ain’t over yet
Hurricane season takes it toll
"Weaponized Weather Should Be Outlawed"!!! "Lock Up The Perpetrators"!!!!
the biggest losses? the food crops
Days after Trump calls Climate change "fake". A once in 200 year hurricane hits - yeah - think mother nature is trying to tell you something? Climate change is cold hard reality. It is scientific fact.
Mother Nature really doesnt like Florida
Hey Vsauce! Michael here.
Congratulations Michael you doing a good job
Rapture is on its way.
My cousin lives there lots of damage prayers
Hey GOP:  Climate change is real!  Stop being so pigheaded and greedy!
So blessed that we don’t have this here..keep safe people as long as your love ones are ok the rest is material possessions. It will be a battle but stay strong 🙏
Sign of the Times
For the future storm's that sweep through. Is their anyway to make those walls more sturdy after the pass?
While in California..
God bless the people
Thank you for that news.
That hotel must have been made of Raditz... or something equally as weak...
The news team can report but can't help the ones in need
Stay away from the windows Jimmy got dammit

The Earth is having birth pain is ready to spew so many sinners off her!!
Satan is behind all this.
Now that is scary weather
It's not just about climate change,it's broken laws of God ,
That's a lot of damage. I pray to satan to help the people in need.
Yikes. The map projects the storm headed directly our  way in Athens,ga. It's gonna get bad in about an hour! I'm taking my beagle for a walk now. Cheers
Stay strong the people of Florida

Welcome to the End Times

Cudos to the cameramen
we filipinos are used to that kind of storm
So, you heard what the news reporter said, " it's almost apocalyptic ", so don't get mad at me!
I hope there is no more people gotten hurt/killed...😰😭😭😢😢
Dam. I'm in Florida and I didnt know there was a hurricane?!?!? 😅
Right wing nuts are saying today:

" a good guy with a hurricane would've stop that bad guy with a hurricane"
Keep your head up god next to you believe.
gotta love climate change, it's all fake news right?
Can you imagine? “I’ll park my car here to protect it” and the next thing you know, something fell on your car.
�Your face would look better between my legs.�
Be humble people;)
I am in tampa. I got lucky it was just some rain and some wind
Please People pray!!! Stop fighting amongst yourselves. You are all Americans! Stop everything so that God will have mercy on humanity
God bless Florida
this is sad best beaches in the world
Please vote 🗳 this Nov
insurance companies must be crying
We are in Dothan, Alabama, 90 miles north of PC.  We've been without power since 1:00 pm.   We have not been able to get current news for our area all day.  Even this weather report is old.    

1969 I think is when Hurricane Camille came through and spun off so many tornadoes.

News channels are leaving us totally in the dark as to where Hurricane Michael is.
Holy Cow!
That looks like the awning of the hotel , not the roof.🤯
My mom stepdad stinkers fishies all evacuated
Hey vsauce Michel here
It's a good thing we don't send our money to other countries now. Because we need to pay for our damages from the storms and hurricanes.
Damn, they got it real good
Your cars are to blame
Ight they got the name right.
:O Hopes and prayers to all of you in the hurricane. So sad
Very fine news reporting.  Thank you.
Almost Apocalyptic he said.

Jesus is coming soon... Repent. for all these things occurring worldwide are just the beginning of sorrows.. More to come..
Why 👏 are 👏  you 👏 stand 👏 ing 👏 outside?
My thoughts and condolences goes to all the families and the people who survived Hurricane Michael. Be strong Florida.
God is coming back
Prayers go out to everyone
Hope they have good incurrence
God have mercy on those people. Guide and protect them in they precious name Amen.
“Please stop with the hurricanes I lost everything ☹️”

Mother Nature: 🖕😂🖕
Man alive. If you don't think global warming has a part to play, you are in denial.
omg feel really  bad
THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE
Hm ye only a 2 hour delay tho
The easy part is over.
I don't get why they still make buildings and structures from paper thin plywood and cheap 2 x 4 wood studs. I don't know how people in America didn't even bother to learn the mistakes that were portrayed in the three little pigs story... It's like knowing you will get robbed, and still don't buy yourself a lock to prevent it from happening. And then you are shocked and stunted, wondering why you got robbed in the first place.
202nd comment lmao
😰😢 hoping the human and animal casualties will be nil. 🙏🙏
Florida stay taking L's. Just joking damn my prayers go out to Florida residents. Im from texas so i know what its like to go thru a hurricane. It sucks
Thats right Michael, parge the wicked!! ✊
And they still say global warming is a hoax. This is just the beginning.
I was just there so sad to see all the destruction
Wow , prayers from Ukraine !
That's really scary. So happy my relative moved from Florida months ago.
Damn Florida isn’t getting any breaks
God's anger strikes again
We all gone flying
That escalated quickly. I feel so bad for these people I’ve been there. I’m originally from the Panhandle and I lost my house in hurricane Ivan years ago. I also went through Hurricane Harvey last year.  The only good thing about a storm is how strong it makes the community afterwards. The aftermath is stressful but together they will get through it.
irma is stronger then micheal and they said that thing is the strongest hurrican that hit the us since 1969
Keep praying maybe Trump will care about you lol. You guys voted for this.
LUKE CHAPTER 21:25-27. mens heart's failing them because of these things coming waves roaring and sighed on earth moon sun!!!
This is so sad and devastating to watch, I hope everyone in Florida is safe!
Florida needs to be wiped off the map anyways lol
My prayers goes out to all the families!🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is my home
N0thing but the government doing this. Look up cloud seeding they came up with it in the 1960s and used it for war. Why your think those airplanes be in the sky spraying stuff
Is insurance gotta pay for all of that damage.
CORRECTION @ABC.. NOT THE STRONGEST TO HIT THE US SINCE 1969.. ANDREW WAS 1992 & A CAT-5
Imagine Puerto Rico in the moment , everytime you try to look outside it was sad , Hurricane Maria was category 5.
I feel bad for Florida 🙏😭😢😰😱🤧
Great reporting David, BE SAFE BUDDY👼🙏✝️📖📑👣💛✝️✝️✝️, 
MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!!🙏🙏🙏 ✝️✝️✝️👼
Keep driving dipshits
Im in Michigan, my thoughts are with those in Mexico Beach.  I wonder if any houses, etc. survived.  I can’t believe all the negativity on this site.  Im embarrassed for all of you that see this is a funny thing.
Thats exactly how hurricane Maria felt like... Like civilization was torn down
Like 21 playing out in real time
Some of us still don't believe the end is near, this is nothing!!! Wait and watch!!!
Damn it, i got hit and there’s no power 😭😭 no fortnite
That force coming through right before the hotel pillar gives way and the roof comes down is uncanny.
That’s an easy $150 to replace the windshield in her car. That ladies damages in bad.
I am from Tartaria, people from The USA you should take shalter of Rassia (the part of Tartaria)
Stay SAFE  all...🙏❣
Let's all PRAY!!!💕🙏
I've got a my niece in Georgia Lord keep her safe and her family.😦 she's in the path.
This has nothing to do with global warming.
WE NEED NACHOS!!!
“Well damn Jackie! I can’t control the weather”
Anyone need food? I have lot of rice I can send out. Just slide me a DM
Damn I got sick just watching this.
Respect to that reporter tho
"Let's rebuild so we can act all shocked next time all our shit is destroyed again"
Great....David "Manure" reporting!! I'm out....will not listen to this fool.
People need understand that the anger of GOD is in places with too much sin.....
People need to stop bringing God and "Prayers" to the comments.
You know that the atheists will become triggered and tell you that god and prayers dont work.
Tallahassee gang where you at?
Thank goodness. Every people  safe after hurricane.
The word you're looking for is "portico." Not roof.
Wow! Real news on ABC... while CNN and MSNBC continue non stop propaganda on Donald Trump.
pray for florida 🙏🌹🙏
You have strength you know you do Do not give up this will pass we shall overcome
micheal myers no
This hurricane was made by Donald Trump he’s pure evil
florida gets another hurricane for the year first irma now michael
The end is near
I love Florida, but my God they always get hit with hurricans. Prayers to the Families.
That's where your wall should go.
This is so sad, I went through Irma last year the only thing we lost was power for about two days nothing this devastating. Praying for these people.
Jesus is coming soon!
where is ur JESUS now 😂
God bless they souls
Hey Florida Vsauce Michael here, where are your roofs?
Some of those coastal neighborhoods are just gone. Where did all the debris go!? OMG!!! 😢😢😢
A moment of silence for all of those who will not be able to play cod tn 😔
Looks ALMOST as bad as my bedroom. ALMOST.
I think it's time to consider stopping the rebuilding in these areas on the coasts and start building inland...
Damn Miami is lucky this year sorry for the panhandle have a nice day
they deserve it
just build lol
This is so sad. 😢😢😢😢😢
Climate change!!! Rock you like a Hurricane!!!
Hope this doesn't add to the python epidemic like Andrew left.
Keep voting in Republicans this only the beginning. Climate change is a Chinese hoax don’t ya guys know that 🤧
This is the beginning more to come
It's not a roof; it's an awning
So how do we volunteer to help out?
Build concrete homes instead of wood
Is Tampa ok
Global warming is a hoax made up by China.
I wonder if trump is gonna go down to Florida and throw some toilet paper at the people
Whilst telling them it’s fine . 

Lmfao ....
Ok but y would u live near a beach y not live in the middle like 2 or three hours away?
Chemtrails haha geo storm real time the movie showed yall 🐑
Ahhhh! Is this true 😢😯😢😯😢😯😢😯😢😯 So sad
I meant sinners paid their price
I hope that anyone hit by the hurricane has a quick and safe recovery❤️🙏🏾
Thanks Obama.

Oh wait, my bad, thanks Trump.
1 point palm trees.
Column made from steel pipes and plasterboard... Hahahahahaha
It's going to be a black friday on the panhandle. Free dollar store reparations.
Hope they got those rooms for free.
the MOST HIGH is bringing judgement to America

..this Babylon is finished!
What people stayed to film?
My heart goes to all the helpless animals 💔💔💔
So many climate change alarmists...
Imagine chilling in your house watching pornhub and the roof just falls
Why is people outside walking? SMH!
Noooo I live in Georgia!
Let's see I can fly
This is funny:D
Seems horrible.. I'm lucky that I live in NJ and no hurricanes often come here.
Hope everyone is safe and with their families😌
Why's Michael always gotta be messing stuff up?

Okay soooooo maybe just maybe climate change is a real thing 😬
I feel for those people I kno their pain nola 05 Katrina
Plastic...
No😭😭😭
Well I guess Albert was wrong
Well, Michael will most likely be retired. It being this bad.
MSM is soo damn dramatic.
Nature always wins.
They should make the houses into boats. Floating homes with anchors to keep them in place.
Mother nature is fighting back. This is her earth.
um my name is Michael so I'm so sorry Florida
GUNGA GINGA
I feel very bad for those ppl. I hope they will be safe again. I understand that this had occurred and this was just one of the second most biggest hurricanes since 1969
I heard that it is the date 1851 not 1969
Maybe its time we listen to mother nature for once
I’m so scared my great grandma and grandpa live in Florida and we’ve went to that beach before 😭😭
Lost my gramps
I just wanna know how they got all those good shots in that wind and the camera stayed stable
How can we help
Nature is scary.. I hope people/animals got out in time
Michael Myers has definitely returned.
Did the banks & aTm's blow away also?
3rd strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US.
Nobody had a fokin launch pad?
Mother nature really doesnt like flordia
prayers to North Florida.  I am in SW Florida and it looks really scary to me. I hope people won`t be hurt.
I wish I coukd have been at that hotel. I blew it. Went to Tallahasee but I left too late in the morning to get there in time. I hope I get another chaance someday.
Only jesus save  look for
diners pay their price
Extreme empathy for those people!
Some one tell Trump that climate change is real.  Period.
Seems like the Coast Guard are going to have a lot of this hurricane
hey vsauce
I feel so sorry for the people that are trapped they had no warning ⚠️ at all the Storm came out of nowhere !!!
Why does ABC try so hard to scare the sheeple
First kinda
This guy
Is HAARP involved to destroy and control us?
Palm trees gangsters.
Don’t worry it’s just the hurricane mod
It wasn't such a big deal. A lot of media hysteria.
Global warming
God help them

The Earth is so beautiful isnt it?
So sad for all involved ......glad the hotel gave shelter for the   people.......still nice people around.....

Imagine getting clapped by a hurricane named Michael
Insurance companies are having emergency meetings to come up with ways to not pay for claims
The storm is closing in hit the chug jug
Damn I’m over here in Miami with some good ass weather
Just imagine that in 3 more weeks that area would had get hitted by a Cat 5 hurricane!! (That happened in Puerto Rico)
Wow Florida just can't have a break
Mother's going to come and flush it all away! Learn to swim!
N O W   T H A T   A L O T        O F    D A M A G E

Real talk why does so much bad shit happen to Florida? It seems like every other week some crazy shit goes down over there
That was scary
Weatherman Mike Seidel would have loved to be there to experience the real storm...named in his honor
Damn ..
Sacrifice Florida
Seriously in Florida they don't build stuff to survive hurricanes?????
What happens when Hurricane Michael hits Jackson?
Then this hurricane just got BAD.
I’m not in Panama City but I was in Santa Rosa and we left to a shelter during the storm, we came home and our area was okay. I feel bad for PC I like to go there sometimes ☹️
If It was real news news but this fake news.
some where anderson cooper is standing in a ditch
Don't worry Floridians, I am sure Trump will arrive soon to throw you some paper towels, if you're really lucky he may even dedicate a golfing trophy to you.
Anne Frank
Wow I love that
Don’t ask for BFB 13 ever again...
why must they constantly do pop ups11 RUINS IT!!!!!!
Welp, insurance companies... ASSEMBLE!!! TIME TO PAY BITCHES!!
Natural disasters is powerful than gossiping.
I hope u guys will be ok
micheal the original father form the vampire diaries
We have a tornado in virginia
More hurricane is coming, if people not  going to do something.
guys its just level 4 and 5. in the next just few years, not even a decade you will see category 6 and 7
Bad statistic given.  It is NOT the strongest to hit since 1969.  Hurricane Andrew hit Miami in 1992 as a Cat 5
At least this storm is fast moving.  It escalated from a tropical storm to cat 4 that quick.  Compare that to hurricane Harvey which was so slow moving and Houston got all that rain.  Ever since I saw that fake ass broadcast from the weather channel with the guy pretending to sway in the non existent wind I don't believe what I see on tv anymore.  I feel so sorry for the helpless pets and ppl who have to stay in shelters.
Keep on electing Republicans. God is punishing... Values and Morals are at an all time low in Florida.
The ocean will consume this planet. Watch.
Prayed up
Ttump will be there soon with paper towels!
The Spirit of God is being withdrawn. The destroyer " satan" can control the weather.

God is Trying to " wake people up, because "  there's a much greater crisis ahead.  Much, much worse , and more widespread than this. 

Ironically  the name " Michael " is a Hebrew name. It means " is like God"

If you haven't fallen on the Rock , Jesus, and be broken.....then you'll be ground to powder.
Lmao my package of clothes might get lost
R.I.P white SUV.....
Now thats reporting! Right in the middle of the action
Praying for victims of Hurricane Michael. Be safe. Have peace. Stay strong. 💙❤🇺🇸
God bless USA
I live in Marion county Florida. For some reason, we haven’t had rain in the past 24 hours.
4th largest not THE largest . Moron

Сочувствую. Мы недавно наводнение пережили. Держитесь!

Why do news reporters report like they're not apart of the situation?

News Reporter: As you can see here young Kyle Jenkins is going on  a shooting rampage right in front of me lets follow and investigate
So much focus on roofs, good report on roofs
No good in any storm that begins with Hurricane.
Jesus christ
Gives me maria flashbacks, no joke. Be safe everyone. Its up to the people to help eachother afterwards
Where those houses made in China?! #1 economy on the planet you'd think Americans would build more solid houses...
I hope they do what we did in south Florida And change the building code to the Miami Dade code
That Is what the people in Puerto Rico suffer in Hurricane Maria.
Dont worry Trump well be there soon offering paper towels...
So, Michael is a very bad guy.
Ssoub7ana llah l3adim 9ader 3ala koulli chaye waffa9akom llah
God do this.
We need help from Puerto Rico think they can give us some water bottles back ?
Comments are a real shitshow here.
Godspeed
very happy about hurricanes hitting US - much deserved punishment for denying science of climate change, you can pray to imaginary powers all you want - reality of the world will hit your delusional person anyway. 

heat your surroundings - prepare to boil
Sin !
The wrath of God
Pray that everyone gets out of this hurricane safely.
My family was in this hurricane... We lost contact and don't know anything now..
Why dont all these people have boats and life preservers?  Ill never understand how one lives by ocean but has neither????
“Apocalyptic “
wuy don't they build the houses and buildings of cement and Steele?
I have an old high-school friend in Mexico Beach, named Chuck Guard. I hope he is okay.
This is only the beginning........
Why do all weatherman have the same tone? Do they force it, or is it all the same guy?
Please hit mar a lago
How odd that hurricane Michael hit with a new HOLLOWEEN movie came out
Natural Disasters is Gods Punishment for our sins.
😢🙏🏼
Thanks for doing professional news coverage. This is what your channel should be doing. Not the subjective emotional garbage which has become common place.
Mean while in new england yup this why we dont go down to florida ill just deal with the snow
i didnt know that hurricane was going to be this strong
Georgian here. Drinking straight vodka and trying not to shit myself.
Hate to say this but MAN needs to stop messing with mother nature. HAARP, Geoengineering and I'm sure CERN plays a role too..my heart is sad for everyone :(
God protects the weak and the poor🙏🏻
Epic
Come on and and slam and well..
I can relate. We were totally destroyed by Hurricane Irma last year, never ever have I experienced a storm that powerful.. shook  our apartment for 2 hours , tore roofs off, toss boats & cars all over the place. May god be with those people that were affected by Hurricane Michael.. stay strong 💪🏾 and stay prayed up. God bless you all 🙏🏾
Hurricane *Bichael
And the dumb thing is that people will come back to this place, and rebuild. Just move away somewhere else.
fake news
Who cares. This has been going on since the beginning of time. No big deal.
It doesn’t matter how much you pray these people still lost everything...
Only people who are scared of dying believes in a god what weak humans
This is probably the worst year ever for Florida
President, Panama City and Mexico Beach have been nearly wiped off by a hurricane"

Trump: " I will tweet my condolences later to the Presidents of Panama and Mexico after I'm done with Kanye West.  I wish we could help but Amurica first"
Funny how the largest pop of unbelievers for global warming get get hit the most
Whats the hazard pay for this??
Does anybody else think that earth is gonna come to a end?
This was shot in a hollywood studio....

#FakeNews
Not as bad as Katrina
the brother of hurricane Maria.  We most get accustom to this weather.
I guess climate change is still fake
Every county in the state should adopt the building codes we have in S. Florida.  Dade/Broward/Monroe...not sure if Palm Beach has them too.
Don't worry people the whole country will taste gods wrath.
Cardi b
Hurricane Micheal Myers :/
JESUS IS COMING SOON!
All who left their houses are being victimized by BLM raiding their homes . I heard it from Rush and Hannity ....spread the word ......Al Gore......Benghazi ....
That makes sad when I think about people how are there during the storm. It's just like experiencing a war made by someone against someone and the victim are Innocents people.
I hope all people there are safe.
Wonder why things are getting so intense everywhere !!!
Yea but whose boat was that boat?
Remember to vote the hurricanes away in the next election folks!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Isaiah 29:6 - Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
This is great reporting but it's important to note that this hotel is in Panama City Beach, where the winds were "only" 100 mph (category 2 strength).  The worst of the winds @150mph (category 4) were more than 20 miles south of this location, and you wouldn't be standing there filming it.
1 million = 1,000,000
Get right with God people, we're living in the end times.
Anyone else pissed off that they won’t put Drake and Josh on Netflix?

I thought YouTube wasn't supposed to monetize disasters?
Tbh It wouldn’t be hard for me to believe the News channel took the roof off because all the faking they’ve been doing this year 💀
there were loads of people saying its fake news
Who knows if things will get worse or better there are more hurricanes then ever
WOW 😳😑☹️
This reporter is brave and handsome ( no homo)
As someone who is not personally effected from the hurricane, but has a lot of family in mexico city, thanks for the prayers. It means a lot to see a community band together and offer up prayers. My grandmother and uncle lost their little convince store and houses but were luckily evacuated to another uncle in Tallahassee. Heading there this weekend to bring a generator and what not. Thanks again. :)
大家好！
I live in Alabama and we’re going to be in red zone tonight I think. My windows are literally howling.. i’m so scared.. our house is surrounded by trees🤭🤭😩🙏
Prayers who are affected - Bigger ones are ones is on the way as we continue to stress mother earth - Earth will break our ego. - Time to awaken and know the principle and design on which earthworks to sustain herself. The fact that we are not awakening shows how much blind we are.
So sad
Trump should've done a rally in Florida to not disappoint his fans.
Why not built concrete buildings where there's risk of hurricane? At least the towns would not be wiped off the map.
I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, Florence brought a little bit of rain and wind and it was right off the coast but Michael brought a ton more rain and a lot more branches/trees came down
where is trump？
Sad how it has to go this way before Trump and others understand the importance of climate change. Here’s the proof
I didn’t know Trisha Takanowa was actually a news anchor.
Looks fun
I live in New Bern. I feel for ya guys, Florence got us a few weeks back. Nowhere near as bad though. Praying for you guys.
Strongest storm ? What happened to Wilma and Andrew?
woah...
I live in Panama City beach and stayed because we couldn’t find a hotel for 4 dogs and a cat. Luckily my neighborhood didn’t get it as bad as others. Our power is out of course and trees are broken and fallen everywhere, but the houses didn’t suffer much damage. But Panama City beach is broken down and torn apart. I was lucky but sadly not everyone was.
Andrew was stronger
What is with these names for hurricanes?
Hello, Humans. "I too once had a family, Danny. Many years ago I lived in Japan: a pet of my master Yoshi, mimicking his movements from my cage and learning the mysterious art of Ninjitsu, for Yoshi was one of Japan's finest shadow warriors. His only rival was a man named Oroko Saki, and they competed in all things, but in nothing more fiercely than for the love of a woman, Tang Shen. Shen's love was only for my master and rather than see him fight Saki for her hand, she persuaded Yoshi to flee with me to America. But Saki vowed vengeance. I remember it well, as my master returned home to find his beloved Shen lying on the floor, and then he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words, and during the struggle, my cage was broken. I leapt to Saki's face, biting and clawing, but he threw me to the floor and took one swipe with his Katana, slicing my ear. Then he was gone, and I was alone."
~ Master Splinter from (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

TERRANCE OUT
I was in Irma last year .. our house got hit with a strong cat2 with cat3 wind gusts ... let me tell you that was some scary shit ...
When your garage door starts to bow in and out from the wind gusts .... the ac vents inside the house rattled upon wind gusts ... every wind gust that came thru, you were hoping that nothing breaks thru ...
I could not imagine a solid cat3 or higher coming thru ...
That hotel canopy is not roof, it's a canopy.
Am I the only one thinking how much stuff you could steal
Oh my I'm so glad I didn't go there for fall break cause that's where I usually go for vacation that's really scary I hope they are all OK
Did I just see the Florida man reporting this?
RIP 😢
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
My city didn’t happen anything and it Kissimmee
Like Hurricane Andrew in '92, which was also classified as a category 4 hurricane at the time of its landfall in the Homestead Florida area. Interestingly enough Hurricane Andrew was reevaluated and formerly reclassified as a category 5 hurricane ten years later in '02, joining the ranks of Hurricane Camille in '69 and the Labor Day Hurricane in '35. Similarly, I believe Hurricane Michael will be reevaluated and perhaps reclassified as a category 5 hurricane joining the small elite list of landfalling category 5 hurricanes. There's too much destruction that's reminiscent and quite similar in nature to that of Hurricane Andrew.
My 20 year old concrete house can withstand and storm
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Mhwo
🙏🙏🙏
Geoengineering
Omg..
I thought i was but Michael is cat 5
Haha!
People will say this was staged, those are actors. There was no hurricane.
Repent to Allah before a painful day(The Hour) comes
Would be nice to get real reporting rather than these overpaid ABC dorks. Be safe everyone.
My state is hurting tonight.
May God make them suffer more for what they've done to MIDDLE EAST.
Hope Trump doesn't aid people throwing papel towels at them🙏...
What is the approximate time that these hurricanes remain for example, in one state?
I'm from the common wealth of Dominica and we went through hurricane maria last year and now its this hurricane affecting Florida, so sad. People of florida, stay strong.
man I sure wish a hurricane would hit the white house xD
Jesus was a carpenter. Why doesn't his sorry ass float down to help repair their roof?
i think the hotel you all are in is next or did you think it will stop out of nowhere?
super
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
omg thats what y'all get for voting trump
MOTHER NATURE DON"T GIVE A DAM ABOUT YEW !!!
Trump strikes again!
I thought global warming fueling hurricanes was a lie, a Chinese hoax. Well say goodbye to your rooftop it's going to China.
Time is precious. We are fragile. Life is short. Eternity is long. Every minute counts.  be a faithful steward of the breath God has given you
Where is the president?? Campaigning
Not the "f"ing roof of the hotel its the hotel car port roof.
I HAVE THE BEST WAY TO AVIOD THIS KIND OF TRAGIC DISASTER.... GET THE HELL OUT OF FLORIDA... 😎
The comment section needs to be disabled...
So sad :((( Guess their halloween is ruined :( Good luck people out in the hurricane! :( I feel bad for the people who lost their homes too. Prayers to everyone inside of this terrible storm right now 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I have no sympathy. You live on a coastline and built a house from wood . Come on dude.
And just think, this is just the beginning of it for flordia. Just wait until half the state is permanently under water in 4 years
MJ>LEBRON
I know there’s a lot of speculation on global warming, but there definitely something going on, there’s been a lot of powerful hurricanes in a very short amount of time, ands scary
I dont even think it was a hurricane
I think they were testing a new weapon

Just think about it...
What are the ingriedients to a storm?
If you have hands
You can cook one up ⚡🌀🌊❄🌋
Where's TrumpleThinSkin At This Time of Need?
Geez there's like 2 hurricanes a month now
Trust me.... if we had built a wall.....a beautiful wall....a wall so treemendus like.....just treemendus.....Huge...all around Florida.........paid for by the animals in Mexico....the island of Florida would be safe....
perfectly safe........believe me.
Dead island riptide
The Earth is taking back what is rightfully hers.
Fortunately Michael was a fast-mover. Hit hard, hit fast, move on. Michael had the wind and storm surge, Florence had rain for days. Both storms were very destructive, and illustrate how ineffective the 'Cat 1-5' ratings based on wind speed are at helping people understand what to expect and how to react. This is why the Florida coast used to be simple 1 or 2-story reinforced cinder block structures, they could withstand hurricanes and were cheap to repair. They accepted the fact that hurricanes would come sooner or later and built accordingly.
I had a friend that lived in Virginia and he moved 2 weeks ago he thought hurricane Florence was going to hit us but luckily it didnt. Now he just moved to Florida and this is what he gets. This right here was his WORST FEAR I feel so sorry Tyrone. All my best hopes and prayers may be with you. 🙏🙏
So: First of all i am really Sorry for the victims. So i did the Moral thing

But you have to admit
They deserved every second of it.
The Industry in the USA is way too big
They throw pollution around them like shit and they dont even care.
But when a hurricane occurs all are like: "Oh shit why do we deserve this"

And for all These republican kids that now shit About pollution and how it affects storms; Yes, yes pollution  worsen a storm and yes they will get harder and harder until you stop. 
So believe in the "Chinese Hoax" and i hope the Hurricane will come to you, too^^

Sorry for eventual grammar errors

Panama city .a beach full of homos and white snobs. That place is heartless a lot of murders happen there especially during spring break. When all the privileged  do all there drugs .panama city is bad .
Theres always some weird ass news reports going on down there of course Florida would get hit
So the elite sicked Haarp on Trump in key largo. Don't make sense . They are pissed
If your gonna live in fl better have a brick house reinforced with concrete and steel beams built 20 feet above your ground level or your shit is gonna get messed up eventually
People, start to build solid buildings! You are ridicule yourself.
Pray people are safe and no one lost their live
amor los finales felices muajajajajaja
I’m a 8yr old kid loving this my life is a lie now;(
Wow!! 😳
Damn

Conservetards will find a way to blame liberals for this
wow flordia has had 2 huricanes now its sad that 26 people died for this huricane
52. Say: "Do you wait for us (anything) except one of the two best things (martyrdom or victory); while we await for you either that Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait, we too are waiting with you."
That is not the roof of the hotel goober.  It is the  porte-cochère which any noob could have predicted would have come down.  It's like a big airplane wing.  What is wrong with these reporters?
PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH WAS ATTACKED IN 01 BUFFALO NY HOUSING STAFF WERE ATTACKED 1990, ANOTHER OR 2 nd TABLE OF PEOPLE AT A WORK MEETING WHO APPEARED LIMP MAYBE DEAD. US HUD OFFICE NY.
Fake news.  Nothing happened.  Lol
Wait...you mean something significant is trending on YouTube? Did I accidentally JUMP into a new timeline?
The Chinese made this happen to punish the Americans for tariffs.
I’m so sorry my fellow countrymen and women :( many blessings for you and your families! My thoughts and prayers are with you! God Bless America!
Quit naming Hurricanes friendly names and people would be more quickly to evacuate.
We need to stand up against this hurricane that is oppressing our society.
The earth is rebuilding its self through these horrific hurricanes is sad but it was said by god in revelations all we can do is stay strong keep our head up pray everyday to the main upstairs and rebuild ourselves and homes and stick by one another and help each other as one nation and a family..
Everything 75 miles of the coast should be torn down from Texas to north Carolina except for sea ports and emergency services. In its place plant trees. Then we dont have to worry about hurricanes or rising sea levels anymore.
LOL!
Fake news

Stop being mean hurricane go away
This video is fake!!! Fake!! Fake i say, CGI. They all doing everything to make us believe global warming is real, smh!
humans have to rethink how our coastal infrastructure is built in these regions. just rebuilding is increasingly insane. concrete structures, elevated "safe ground", underground electrical infrastructure, etc! america needs to make it happen!
Well when you live right on the water front what did you expect. Sooner or later it was going to get hit. Should have thought really hard about moving there. FL is the last place I would have moved to. I'll stick closer to the woods. And to stay in the storm not a good idea to stay. Can't feel bad for you.
Casualties ?
OOF
OOF
My aunt died from hurricane Michael
Puertoricans endure more than 20 hours under those same circumstances, maybe worse! With  200mph winds... it is terrifying! Wishing a speed recovery, hopefully you being on the main land bring all the help needed ASAP unlike P.R.
pray
Seriously.....climate change has no cure 
Volcanoes erupt...we can only watch
Earthquakes...
Hurricanes....
This has been happening for millions of years...
The earth is not a static thing nor will it be controlled...
We are cleaner than weve ever been as a whole....
All we as a race can do is use our advancing technology to build better structures...its out there.
Its a coastal area....the ocean is vast and powerful. ( i was on a destroyer in a hurricane in the atlantic) There will be many more hurricanes in the years that follow. Thats what the earth did and does long before we were here. Do you keep rebuilding every few years in the same places that are wiped out every few years. I saw florida get wiped out some years back..storm surge took the coastal homes away...disappeared. How ironic that the human race can send cameras to other worlds but we cant build a hurricane proof home. Or a tornado proof home. Is this a surprize.....
The word hurricane/earthquake/volcano.....destroys and renews.
We are a tiny part of this as we suffer the damage caused. You know i could use recycled everything but will it stop an eruption? Or a tsunami caused by an earthquake? The earth does what it does.
I don't mean to be political and really do feel and care about what the families are going through. However is demonstrated fact that with the planet warming, these storms will become more severe with greater catastrophic flooding and winds. As the populations also grow along coastlines, more people and property will be in harms way.   Aside from measures to ensure we don't contribute to the planet's warming, what we need are investments in infrastructure, smarter storm barriers that one day can help weaken the storm off the coast (hurricanes are starved of warm ocean moisture when they go across solid terrain) before it actually gets to the main populated lands.   We need private/public partnerships that build smarter roads, bridges and bulildings that can withstand category 5 or greater wind speeds and better storm drainage back to the oceans.  We can have political fights on the daily, but nature has no political agenda.
I've been through six hurricanes. Elena, Charlie, Irma, Jeanne, Ivan and Frances..They were all very different. None of which were any fun. Anything past Cat 2...leave
So..
Watching Michael when you're living in  the Panhandle was insanely scary.... I really wished they evacuated when they has the chance but they didn't.. We didn't because we lived here... But the people vacationing should've done that
It's been like 3 hurricane's here, and FEMA didn't even help. And it's scary with 4 small children.
Cool water park
What amazes me is that they keep building wooden houses in hurricane areas. I lived in Okinawa for a while and they get hit by Cat 4 and Cat 5 hurricanes all the time, but their houses and buildings are concrete so they're barely inconvenienced. Eventually the US is going to have to learn and start building their houses the same way.
Was anyone else hoping that their school would be canceled

How did the camera men/ tv presenter not die????
im getting hit by it right now...
http://DoWeeklyWork.com/?userid=5405
It wasn't the roof of the hotel - it was just the port cochere, which you would expect to have problems in a major hurricane. So unnecessary to exaggerate, when it was as bad as it was.
Lol
That's why I don't live in Florida. Anyone living there is stupid.
Fake news.
Houses should be built to withstand cat 5 hurricanes.
EEE.
Wow
Sorrrrrryyyyyy
😔🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Just the weather doing what it does. Nothing new here.
People do you think David Muir or Lester holt is a better reporter here?
I just hope people don’t leave the pets behind ,we all have right to live
We have probably LESS than 12 years before this is going to be the new normal... and the worst will be a lot worse.
Oof
Oof
“The most alarming part of the sentence ‘we are facing crisis’ is not the word ‘crisis’. It’s the word ‘we’.”

An explanation as to why there are so many climate change deniers. They’re simply too afraid to confront the consequences of their own actions. So they run.
Scary.
...
God please why do you allow us to go through disasters? If you say you love us so much then why put us through this?
Sears is better than the storm , buy sears to show bezos wrong , help sears now now after hours gets 80 cents per share, because sears is good
AT THE END IT IS GEORGE STEPHANOPOLIS FROM FRIENDS REMEMBER WHEN THE GIRLS GOT HIS PIZZA AND HE GOT THEIRS
Lotta prayers in these comments. Hope they work better than the prayers after the last hurricane
0:26  FAKE NEWS .......Was not even close to the Strongest Hurricane  since 1969. This was nothing compared to 1992 Andrew Cat5  hit Miami FL with 177 mph winds  with 27.3 billion dollars in damage
http://MyMoneyHour.com/?userid=3297
Did you'll know... That Donald Trump carried Florida in 2016 elections .... He turned Florida Red.... That was historic ... Not this hurricane
Everything is staged today. We’ve seen media FAKE NEWS REPORTS of wind, rain and damage. Don’t know what is real or fake. Maybe that’s their plan...
Where is our President ? Entertaining rappers at the White House...oh ...ok👍
fake and gay
Hoping everyone except the Trump supporters are safe.
To think this is climate changes is fault is ridiculous, Florida is hot literally all year round except for November through Early March, every single month after that is always 80-85+ degrees
Hay Trump Puerto Rico wants to know what the  "relief aid looking like for this one?" are you going to throw more paper towels at them?
Who cares
Damn Micheal really had to do it to em
☝️🕊
Is this like worst than hurricane Irma that happened last year or no..?
http://MyMoneyHour.com/?userid=31064
Good ole tough Palm trees..🌴  however on a more serious note, ,many messengers of GOD have been warning you all of these days..especially the bible of which MOST of you mock..worse and more worldwide disasters coming,sorry to say..
Our mother Gaia is showing us that if we continue to increase our CO2 levels this is just the beginning. This November remember to vote the Republican filth out of office and candidates that are for environmental policies that protect our planet.
Nice
We need to start building bunkers in places that are prone to having hurricanes.
Well, this is a fake hurricane.  "FAKE NEWS".. Why?  Because Donald Trump said "..global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese for economic gain."  Trump is the second coming of our nation's lord and savior.  Just ask any evangelical.  How dare anyone equivocate with Donald Trump---- a true and genuine stable genius!!
It's sorta hard to feel much sympathy for people in a state that elected a governor who banned his own environmental protection agency from doing any research, planning, or even mentioning the term climate change. 
I mean; how many times does mother nature have to prove her point, before the message starts to sink in?

BTW, if you're reading this and plan to respond with some version of "but hurricanes aren't a new phenomenon" -- Don't bother. I already looked into it, and can't find any other storm on record that went from non existent to a category 4 in such a short period of time, let alone a cat 5.
STOP WHORSHIPING A MAN Jesus worship GOD INSTEAD THE FORMLESS GOD INFINITE ONE
It trumps fault,,,,
Who cares about those fake patriot racist hillbillies.... Wash it all away... Its stolen land anyway.  I hope the next hurricane is a category 10.

Come and tell me "Climate Change" is not real! I'll slap this storm onto your face! Everything that have happened is because of the synergic effect of climate change! Bcz the temperature is increasing, there are so much energy available in our atmosphere, that's why the hit and intensity of this storms are hell monster!
These lying sob
There was only a 25 mile wide swath at Panama City beach that got slammed. Targeted right at the Air Force base. Everywhere else got rain
Welcome to our (Puerto Rico) hurricane maria world.  It's just past a year and NOW the insurance and FEMA help is starting to come in.  A year.  I hope Florida does not have to wait so long.

What happened to Disney world?
On November 6, Floridians need to remember that while their lives were destroyed by a hurricane, Donald Trump was hosting a rapper and a rockstar in the White House.
Posted some of the aftermath on my channel. And it’s just “minor” compared to all the other destruction. This things was a beast
TAKE A LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AT THIS ONE SPOT THAT LOOKS TERRIBLE, "DAMNNIT JIMMY DONT MOVE THE CAMERA ANYWHERE ELSE THEY'LL SEE ITS NOT AS BAD ANYWHERE BESIDES HERE"
Thank you God, may I please have another?!  Got dammed a hurricane.  Do we have to rethink living along the coast now?  Or, do we take measures to learn how to control hurricanes and send them right back to Africa?
Lets consider the viewer for a moment shall we? GET YR CRAP OFF THE SCREEN!! We know who you are.....we don't care who the talking heads are!! WE WANT TO SEE THE FOOTAGE DAMN IT!!
Why did it seem like i didnt see almost no coverage of this hurricane until it was about to hit?
I think this year has had the most hurricanes ever, last year was bad too.
My.moms friend that has no family and no girl owned 5 houses there and they got flooded and destroyed
Why don’t they call hurricanes terrorists.
Wow, I’m very late, I live in Panama City and I was with my brother, mom, 2 friends, and my moms friend, me and my friends were sitting in my room when the power went out, then a little while later me and my brother’s windows broke, so we huddled in the hallway, me and my 1 friend were fairly calm, my brother and mom were covering up the dogs kennels, (we had 15 dogs at the time of the hurricane) my other friend was crying with his mom, me and my friend were holding 3 dogs, a bird, and our cat, we locked the dogs and cat up and put up the bird, (they were all in a safe space) and we had to get buckets and towels for all the leaks, putting towels and buckets in every room, our ceiling fans had water coming out of them, the door was breathing, it sounded like a loud whistle, we were only warned that the storm was gonna be a category 2 on Sunday night, then Monday morning we were warned it was a category 4, all the trees outside my house fell down, people’s fences were going past our yard and after the storm, about 2 days after, we went around our neighborhood to see how bad it looked, we saw the light posts snapped in half and stop signs in people’s yards, and every tree was knocked over into the street and into people’s yards, it was truly scary.
HAARP?
they should just stop making wooden houses on the coast i mean its common sense i live in cancun and all the houses are made of concrete and when hurricanes hit you dont see this kind of devastation
Wow !
I sure do Wish you would overdramatize the carbon that we put into the air, as much as you guys try. I always feel like I'm watching an  overproduced telenovela in English when I click ABC...😒

I truly cannot believe "the leading light" of the free world and democracy still uses timber construction in high risk storm zones?? Just when it seems you Americans cannot dumb down more, you do.

Newsflash....RC construction. See Singapore building codes...Dumbass's
i can feel their pain, down here in tampa and it feels like we dodged a bullet again, if you live in florida you're beginning to feel that it's just a matter of time before it's your turn, global warming people, the latest report says we've got 10-12 years to do something significant or events like this will become normal.  people like donald trump and rick scott are the problem not the solution.
Oh please. This is great. It will bring TONS of jobs to the area. Tons of people will get insurance  money AND new cars. We melted the ice caps and we must suffer consequences of that. We cant play the victims. People with insurance, claim everything. The jews will make you  prove everything to get anything. 

Shamless that the news has reported on 6 hurricanes in a row and always making it feel like doom and gloom. Why not show the good parts. How americans can brave the storms and rebuild. Naahhhh. Thats not good ratings huh.
Why do people even live in Florida? Hitch hike up north so you don't have to start over and over again and again...
Ppl got to learn to leave their homes behind even if they just go out of state and stay with strangers or sleep in the car its better than staying in the disaster zone.
What kind of country is this?They must  make  Hurricane  shelter near coast  line citizen.
I just feel for the poor animals.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but laugh a little at 2:38 and what the internet might edit that into in the near future.
That reporter deserves a big raise and promotion. He has nerves of steel. Great, great coverage. What I wonder is how did he choose that hotel? How did the crew know it could withstand the hurricane?
This is what happens when you let gays marry
I’m curious why do people stay yeah I understand the people that can’t afford it but for those who are able to leave why do they stay
Climate change is caused by the Sun. Don't be so arrogant as to think humans can outdo the energy coming from a STAR. Man made "climate change" is a lie. Climate change is true, that's what climates do, they change. They always have, and always will. The problem is, liberals think we can stop it, we can't. All we can do is ADAPT to it. That's where the conversation needs to go. Not the cause, because the sun is the cause, but to how we adapt as humans to something we cannot stop. Cheers
Os arquitetos devem pensar nas formas de construção para a superfície que garanta resistência aos fenômenos dos 5 elementos terra terremotos, água maremotos, fogo lava vulcãnica, ar furacões, éter irradiações de todo tipo de ondas micro e macro, etc... é isso aí irmãos desse zoológico por hora o estágio passante terreno ou da Terra nossa querida Mãe e que nos ajudem nossos avós o Sol e a Lua...
I live here. Tomorrow is day three with no power, no “help” all phone services are down(luckily I have a hotspot on my iPad) people are still trapped . No stores open.. nothing anywhere. We are on a curfew from dusk to dawn because of looters.Damages are so so bad. I watch my fence post one by one ripped and tossed like a rag into my neighbors house, giant trees ripped up like nothing thrown feet away, House across from us just crumble.
For all you people chiming in on this speaking of global warming and what not about the storms how about you do some research and check back the last few years most of the hard-hitting Hurricanes happened between the end of September and the middle of November it's nothing new it's just that time of year
🐊 Where are all the Florida gators though? Will they roam the streets or they are further inland from the sea to be affected? Stay tuned and find out. Now we go for a live briefing from the White House... “It’s gonna be a rough one!”. 🐊
The hurricanes will only get worse:(
God doesnt want people to live in Florida. Florida is the place where XC43 (Jesus Christ) will land. He will only land there when there are no human beings living in the area.
God is not the destroyer! Stop telling people this is God! He the destroyer Apolloyon/Abaddon in Revelations is at work here! Ask who created FEMA way in advance of the destruction of New Orleans! Your government under bush! They have weapons of mass destruction (Star Wars) and are using them! Does 911 ring a bell! That was the kick off! Geepers what do you actually think your nuclear reactors are for? Wake up every nation is involved in this!
By all means this is terrible and very sad . People lost their homes and maybe even severely hurt. But isn’t it crazy that a storm can do this much damage !?
Maybe if we put all the dumbasses that don't believe in climate change including Trump ....and put them inside of one of these hurricane ... tell them to survive maybe they would change your mind about climate change!!!!!
Fake
I pray that everyone would be safe, so as the animals.
I’m sorry we had a hurricane ?
Those news reporters think they are indestructible until they get hit in the face with a stop sign. Like it did to one reporter.  😆
Two deaths so far. One was an infant. May they R.I.P. The westside eyewall crazed this area. This was not even the "dirty" side of the eyewall. They were lucky. What is so crazy is this newscaster was standing right under that roof reporting before it collapsed.
Rip homless and stray animals tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkWEHm3T9Y&feature=share
who else thinks all these hurricanes are a sign that the earth wants us dead?
This hurricane is..fake. Sad! So sad!
We do they have to have people names,how about objects ..
Stoners! Peep Out The Dank Content!! :D
Why would you ever stay for this? Its terrifying! With hurricanes we have the benefit ig warnings weeks  in advance, yet people stick around?
Wow
Maybe God is angry?  Trying to tell us something?
How did Native Americans survive?
I do hope everyone is ok, but at this point, come on people... Stop rebuilding in what could literally be considered a runway for hurricanes.

Ig this is what happens when to many people say rain rain go away please comeback another day...
Karma america karma. Stop invading
They say lives will be lost people will die; you cant call 911 for 2 days......yet they send their camera man and anchor man out there

They are dangerous for real in puerto rico is like the bread if a daily life   ,and people have to stop being stupid material stuff are ni important .they can be replaced..just go to. Shelters  ,i know is sad my  prayers
Why the hell is it called Hurricane Michael.
Isso serve para que as coisas sejam feitas com mais amor e consciência porque não fazemos tudo em forma de pirâmides aí o vento passa sem tantos danos porque não acordam as autoridades para por exemplo para essas coisas simples...
My name is Michael
I bet blacks are out looting
Funny how they get ads.. just saying
If we named hurricanes ghetto names, they wouldn't do anything.
Yo guys I’m sorry but I had to do it to Florida I mean it’s Florida come on
This is what you get when you have too many gays
What a drama queen. His act of concern is so fake.  The guy is forcing the drama out like a fart. Fake Drama, inexperienced reporter, a disservice to the tragedy at hand.
Natures opinion on Kanye meeting Trump
I’m happy I don’t live in the ya that place is probably going to wiped off the earth considering all the natural disasters like hurricanes and yellow stone wich is overdue already
Why God  gives  so many hurricanes to this country :(
vote trump for more hurricanes!
Sorry , the White House is too busy hanging out with Kanye to help.
Didn't this region just go through a hurricane? Or am I getting it mixed-up. Whats with all the hurricanes seriously. If this keeps up living in these coastal areas may not make sense anymore unless there are significant improvement to infrastructure.
It's sad to see how everyone is like "oh so sad, my prayers go for all those who are affected by this " and then go back to living a life of not recycling,  using plastic, waiting on a drive thru for their McDonald's instead of getting off, eating meat every meal. Like wtf is wrong with y'all? Global warming is smacking us across the face and y'all are just taking it. And even if I'm wrong what is so wrong about doing these things that bring no harm to anyone and helps our environment that we live on that gives us life.
I have to tip my hat to David and the ABC news for being their reporting the hurricane. Their is not a check big enough for me to put myself through that if I were a reporter. I hope the damage is limited to just the material things. Hopefully all the families and furbabies are safe.
How dare you not blame President Trump for the weather it’s an out rage! As a president Trump supporter I demand you guys stick with the program!
No one care
I live on a tropical island but never saw  this yet!!we've got hurricane too every single year but i never saw something so dangerous!!ok i live in Mauritius and all our houses are made of concrete even the roof.i mean i know what is the feeling of seeing your houses and trees and everything being blown up like this but i still don't understand how a country like the USA still build houses like that!!I'm really sorry to see whats happening there.i'm not critisising none of the people but living on the coast like that is so weird building houses like this!
The united states are 5% of the world population and using 20% of world resources and the outcome is this you need to change..
台风？
The Coke capital of America where most dealers from Latin America reside has finally got the second call from GOD
Obama, no major hurricanes, Trump, setting records. With all the Trump hate and groups claiming to "own" the weather... It's criminal, my opinion.
Sorry
If you are shiting in a water with the tramp and Francisk , you have to run or Dy every day in your shed on my planet. Amen.
😥😥😥😥😥😥
Yeah, gee, this doesn't happen 20 times a year in Florida...right? Why is this news? If you live there either deal with it or move. No sympathy from me for the idiots out there.
God punished all of you because of the gays🙁.  Repent you sins now,  and god shall lead all of you to heaven
I not care about the people but i wanna know if the animals are okay

Funny song
🚬🐸🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
What are you guys trying to distract us from this time? Making this hurricane out to be a cat 4+ when in reality itd been a cat 1 the whole time.
This is what happens when humans live off from others misery God is watching you can’t go to church or other religious dwellings in the Latin world and then bring illicit drugs to harm a flourishing society and live of its misery look at Puerto Rico and all others it’s time to stop doing all this and start using the land to help and endure humanity
Imagine praying and thinking that does anything at all for the families facing this devastation.

Hope the next one comes soon
They will only get worse as climate change accelerates. There are things that we could all do, that our oligarchy/ corporate owned and controlled government of the elderly rich could do, but the people are too propagandized by the oligarchy’s media and their churches to be willing to act to save ourselves and future generations. Apologize to your children; you CHOSE suicide and mass extinction. You chose war, death and suffering. Your God doesn’t reward blackmailers and greed crazed sociopaths. You, the American people, are responsible for this, ESPECIALLY those of you in the media!
What is expected, it’s Florida? If you’re in Florida you should expect devastating hurricanes. At least they could rebuild. This is just Mother Nature taking course.
This is punishment of God against america because they cross God his redlines n bombing others countries injustice destroying their cities. So this small punishment but big punishment is about come against america with complete destruction no one will survive except those  that God want them to be survive and your Government n rich people n elites will run into their special underground bunkers and the people of america will be the victim
Hurricanes have always existed, but we are making them worst. Exactly like floods and fires. We are destroying the forests, beaches, mountains and so on that use to hold this things down. By building in places we shouldn’t, cutting trees down, destroying landfills, filling them with contaminating and flammable trash, contaminating the skies with fuel, coal and all sorts of nasty stuff we are killing animals, nature and changing the chemistry that helps us live and survive in this planet and we are destroying the things that use to make this natural disasters less strong. But it doesn’t matter to you Americans because you don’t give two shits about anything or anyone until it affects you personally. It will happen to you too, eventually, and then it would be too late to solve the problem. Not wanting to do anything about it is just making excuses for being lazy and egotistical. But we depend on ourselves, no god or shit is gonna helps us if do not help ourselves.
Those illuminati occult devil worshippers could not stop these huricanes occuring in the US?hmmm  thought they are so powerful as the world depicts them lol.
Last year when the two cat 5s devastated the Caribbean lots of Americans made nasty comments.  The most maddening for me was how some people implied that buildings in the Caribbean lacked codes. I kept telling those trolls that no matter what, against a cat 5 storm no amount of codes will make a difference.  Fast forward to now and yeah tell me trolls, how did ur precious codes stand up?? Anyway, prayers for all those affected by this storm.
I will support all of you guys and will rebuild back every single home with Mr. Donald Trump and his cabinet God bless America and American people we love you guys❤️😁👏🏻❤️🇺🇸
We are doomed hurricane after hurricane fires earthquakes nobody can afford the basics anymore but gotta ha ve that damn i phone!
“Woah Hurricane Michael more like hurricane tortilla”
I’m so happy this happen lmao hahaha
I’m from Miami, FL and I’m glad it hit north lol. Don’t got time for that here. But y’all might think that it isn’t that bad, ITS HORRIBLE. I hate hurricanes, no electricity, or signal, and it’s so hot in Florida , it suffocating.
ABC jika di Malaysia bermaksud=ais batu campur@ais kacang :-) sebab asal usul saya tanah islam Malaysia,bumi ni tanah islam tetapi disifatkan tanah arab kerana menurut Al-Qur'an yang diwahyukan dalam bahasa arab kerana disifatkan agama islam...hakikat rasul Muhammad dalam Malaysia berbangsa melayu pula...ada yang lagi hebat dari kuasa Allah?..saya hanya penyampai berita gembira dan duka tapi benar apa yang dikata saya,Allah akan kotakan@laksanakan insyaa Allah...amin
Trumps fault. He doesn't care about black people or brown people or women or queers or tranny's or people without flood insurance. If Hillary was president everything would be ok. If you don't realize this is sarcasm then. Dam, just dam.
Now these  Americans will know the feelings of the people of Syria somehow... How it feels like to see your home destroyed . Being homeless.They loves to make fun out of them .so how does it feel? Remember there is the creator Allah the almighty to punish u . don't think that just because your country does not get bombed like Syria  then you won't be able to face such calamities.....
Don’t know why this mf America builds all houses mostly on wood and stuff.... they should start building houses of cement or brick blocks... America is dumb as hell. People knowing this will happen don’t do shit... they keep building all wood houses don’t know why tbh
Haha God is punishing Florida for being gay and republican!
I wish we had a president we could begin to trust.  This right after us in NC and NC coast still reeling from the last one is getting more rain and we are without any reason to believe  our POTUS when he says no worry.  This is bad, and Flint, Michigan still has no safe water.  How should we trust FEMA or the White House.  They are spending all of our money caging kidnapped children  and creating  huge tax breaks for the one percent.  I’m a conservative but not an idiot.  This is going to be really bad for our country and children.
I don't know.  Does anyone actually care about these storms anymore?  I mean... They warned you coastal idiots to move away from the coasts years ago.  You are still there.  So I guess it's kind of hard to care or feel remorse when you were given the choice but chose to stay.  So now you are getting what you chose.  And I am supposed to feel remorse?  I am truly confused why I should.
Worst hurricane since 1969 huh, guess this invisible town here in south Mississippi never got obliterated in 2005, at least you guys still have structures standing, we were left with just the concrete foundations, there was nothing left, period. But I get it, we do not exist, we of course never even showed up on the news or even talked about when we were eliminated by Katrina. Smh every storm now you hear them say “this is the worst storm to ever hit the US” and what happened to it only being a 1 when it hit? Lol still can’t get this weather thing right can we. And shut up with all the trump shit, god it’s old already stfu
This is what you get for sinning go back to God
Most high ain't playing, y'all keep sinning
Gods left hand was named Florence. Gods right hand is named Michael. Keep voting for war mongering Democrats and Republicans and things will get worse. #voteLibertarianParty if you want gun rights AND gay marriage
Irresponsible
It looks better than Mosul Iraq after the US troops left it! Maybe Trump should bomb this place now to make up the deficiency?
Why do weather reporters tell us to seek cover yet they stand out in the storm with no protection ? Will it take a tree branch going right through a reporter and pinning them to a McDonalds to get them to change practice ?
Will flying sheet metal severing the head of reporter have same effect?🤯😩👊🐔💩
1 like = 1 prayer for all those families going through this devistating hurricane


🙏🙏🙏
My prayers are with these families
Allahu Akbar
I’m in the hurricane pray for me
I was in Hurricane andrew.  The news stations are so dramatic. acting like everyone's devastated.  yes a few people died but most didn't and are good. They like using words like devastated , crash, slamp, bursting,ext... They want to be fear into people just so you watch there channel.
It looks so beautiful 😂😂🇺🇸🇺🇸😸😸
