His eulogy was beautiful.
No matter what our political stance is, let's honor the Bush family durring this time. This is a beautiful eulogy.
I never was crazy about George W and I was a kid during George Sr. But this moment touched me because it shows we are all human.
I also did my father's eulogy. It's the hardest thing to ever do. To convey the love between a father in son to an audience who will never understand that the words you speak will never do the relationship justice. Great job 43.
I love George bush, he has the best sense of humor
I did my own dads eulogy this year and I know that it is hard, that was a great speech.
That truly was a beautiful eulogy! I salute you Mr. President, May you RIP
The last part of his eulogy broke my heart.
My heart broke when he was tearing up
Watching the end left me in tears... I’m crying right now. Thank you for everything and rest in peace  George HW bush
I was never a fan of George W. Bush. However, i can honesty say I have developed a true honest respect for this man, his father and his family.
I admire Bush for his loyalty servicing the country no matter what position he is in.   His presidency has high points and certainly with some criticism, same as any other presidents.  But his character is unique and his love for his family is tremendous.  Beautiful service to remind all the politicians in that room what kind of public service ethic should be.
Was one of the most touching eulogies I have ever heard.  RIP President Bush 41
Mr.President I must say you had a awesome old man during his lifetime. During his term as president he passed one of the powerful civil rights legislation the ADA American With Disability Act which gave the disable more opportunity for employment and lift most of the major burdens that the disable encounter.
I always liked George W. He has a great sense of humor.  And man,he got me at the end..RIP president bush
Never thought George W would make me cry.
WHY would ANYONE 'down-thumb' a Son's eulogy??
Great eulogy. Prayers for his family. So sad
How our 43rd president was able to keep it together I will never ever know....A beautiful eulogy indeed🙏
Probably the best speech he’s ever given
Man its refreshing to see a wise leader.  Not the smartest man but wise and honorable.
this is very loving and sincere. God bless AMERICA!
Well done, Dubya. Appreciate your family's service to the American people.
I was never a fan of George W's politics, especially not of his political party. But his words touched me deeply; and all I wanted to do after he left the stage, was give him a long hug.
What a terrible year for Bush Jr. lost his mom and dad this year
Beautiful eulogy
Thank you Mr. President for sharing this with us. We pray for you and your family!
A great eulogy from a son to his father!  RIP President George HW Bush!
Man i really miss president bush . Very touching and moving speech .  I Always cared for both of them . I served under 41 along with President Reagan;  classy old gentlemen indeed these two and 43 was also good Presidents 
Much respect
RIP George H.W.Bush!! You are now rejoicing with your loving wife and daughter Robin!!!
RIP George HW Bush
Tears. Was not a fan of George Bush as President, but none of that matters. What is heartbreaking is watching a man, a boy, cry for his father. Brings me to tears.
NICE TO HEAR A PRESIDENT SPEAKING PROPERLY!
READ MY LIPS, that was a beautiful eulogy!
aww such an awesome eulogy by his son rip George HW Bush :(
Today, George W. Bush was a son, just a son....
I've really learned to appreciate "W"! No matter what your politics, as a president, a man and as a son,  his character has shown me that he has put his best foot forward. His after office life has been great. His generosity with his time and his thoughtfulness with our troops has been outstanding. I'm sure it was hard for him to say "goodbye" to his father. He did it with love and honor.....I wish him and his family well.
Laura Bush looks regal as always!
Great Family. All should learn from them. RIP SENIOR BUSH
Politics aside people....
This man spent a lifetime in service...
When he did not have to!
So behave yourselves and show respect 👍!
What a beautiful eulogy! Rest In Peace!
God has come to pick up his Angel.  Barbara and Robin welcome u home to the kingdom of heaven..Thank you for all your services 41..u will truly be missed.... ✌✌...
Feel so sad for W and his family not only have they now lost their father they only just lost their mother a few months ago.
Truly beautiful.. I never realized what a great father he was. I was always told he was tough on his kids... and Jeb is an asshole.. but senior and junior have my utmost respect
God bless The Bush family and may that Ole Goat & BB rest well with Robin2❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My arrival to the US in Eugene, OR was in 1989 when "41" was the Commander in Chief.  "43" was the President when I was in the USAF.  Great Eulogy! RIP sir....
In hindsight, George W was treated very unfairly.
Our condolences to the American people for from the country of Kuwait.

We have lost a great man but we will never forget him, he will always be in our hearts.  R.I.P
Houston Strong ❤️💙✈️
Texas Proud ❤️💙✈️
Beautiful & Heartfelt Eulogy ❤️
Continue Prays for The Family ❤️🙏🏽
Not a fan of either George Sr or Jr, but that was a beautiful eulogy.
What a great eulogy!  RIP President Bush. 

Why would 121 people give this a thumbs down?  Bunch of idiots with know feelings.
12:20 it breaks my heart seeing George W. Bush breaking down like that for his father... one must got balls to give a farewell speech to a loved one.
This was a beautiful moment.  What a loving and touching way to eulogize your Dad❤
It must be really hard to loose a love one well we all are gonna die someday so be kind love you neighbor like your self 😊
That was such a beautiful eulogy from a loving son and family who absolutely adored him. I couldnt hold back the tears at the end it really broke my heart. 
💔💔💔😢😭😭
George W Bush did his dad proud today and everyday!!!
RIP Sir, may God's light and love bring you eternal warmth as you are reunited with your Barbara and Robin.
Mr. President, thank you for such a heart felt eulogy.
I do believe the whole nation if not the world broke down in tears with you, Mr. President.  I know I did.....God bless your family at this time, and may God embrace your father in his new life.  
Thank you for loving and leading us, Mr. President. Rest in peace and love.
Dammit what an emotional end, and just as im feeling respect for W. freaking stephanopaulus jumps up and goes ‘HEY THANKS FO...’ totally ruined my mood
He really loved his father. you can tell
R I P George h.w bush LOVE YOU and all ways will!
Such a loving tribute.
And God eulogies Bush sr through the lake of fire.
Thats where satanic traitors go..
To quote Truvy from Steel Magnolias: "Laughter through tears is my favorite emotion."
So evident the LOVE this family has for one another. Let this be the goal in this life for us all to understand and hold dear to what is MOST important: the VALUE of a Loving Family and leaving a Legacy to the Generations present and to come.
Wow.  Just wow.


Not only was that one of the most endearing and just all around incredibly beautiful eulogies I've ever heard.  George Jr. got a brother teary eyed like a mutha.  Good on ya Mr. President.. you done your daddy super proud man.  RIP Papa Bush
God bless  to my Uncle Bush.  Love you , Always . I salute you Sir.
For sure, there was true emotion shown by Bush towards the loss of his father.
It is often the most of times, the loss of a parent.
Lets leave it at that...because im not so sure that emotion truly extends to everyone else.
This made me cry. He sounded like an amazing man and a great father to his kids.
Hebrews 9:27 (KJV)  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
Awww I know how hard is to say bye for ever to your father, beautiful  eulogy, great job, this moment touched me :(
12-05-18
Yesss! And next month... the U.S. government and the nation's main-$tream media machine will clever-lie distract the American population with ANOTHER six week funeral for $enator McCain!
RIP H.W. I hope you're in a better place.
Powerful. I cried at the end. If it was me I'd have been crying at the start...
Great how he spoke of Robin and his mum at the end.
I guess we all think about meeting our loved ones in some sort of afterlife. 

Good to see that all the Presidents were there. Carter had tears in his eyes.
Would have been very interesting to see footage of the biggies being seated...
Wow. That was emotional. God bless The Bush Family :'(
Beautiful may he sleep peacefully x
Im Texan. Born and raised. Proudly🇺🇸. No matter what you could say about the Bush's. You can't deny the love they had for one another. True family goals. This was touching and beautifully said!👏👏💚😀
RIP GW Bush👼
Damn! What a strong son. Rest easy 41.
I never had a father I wish I had of had one like him! Some people are SO LUCKY! R.I.P PRESIDENT BUSH SR.
Very touching. Great job 43!
Praying for the Bush family. May God have mercy on his soul.
Wonderful Family. Although I was not alive at the time, that brought me to tears.
i tell ya George Bush Sr was a good prez of the US, George Bush Jr not so much, one thing is everyone loved George Bush Sr for sure
May Yehovah bless the noble president George H.W. Bush
one thing about George Bush Jr is the ulogy of his father, i couldn't do it, tried with my mom but cried

This was a beautiful eulogy. The Bush family shows how strong and united they are and with the values Bush Sr and Mrs. Bush instilled you can tell it will continue that way. God bless.
dude you had ur dad alive until 72 .... lucky
rip President you will be miss my all
I wasn’t politically a big fan of either Bush Sr or Bush Jr but I have great respect for these men.
Bush Jr. saying such beautifully spoken words about his adored and beloved dad,George Sr., it brings tears to my eyes.his humor, as always,brings light to a saddened situation,and to an audience of onlookers and listeners,his words spoke of a kind hearted,humorous, man of faith,family and friends. George Jr.,what a very well written, wonderfully spoken eulogy... Mr.President you are now with your beautiful soul mate Barbara and precious daughter Robin residing in Heaven hand in hand, along side the Almighty walking those streets paved in gold!.....
rest peacefully Mr.President♡
President George H.W Bush will be missed bigtime.  RIP Mr President
A great man is gone
Literally In tears. RIP
Horrible president but undeniably likeable, relatable and charming. What a great speech.
That was a Beautiful Eulogy😢😢
Thank God , for the gift of your father, I will never forget him.  God bless the Bush family.
Seriosuly. Yall are gawking over a traitor that tried to destroy our freedoms and turn us into a new world order slave plantation. They allllmost had it. The final nail wouldve been hitlary.
But god had other plans ;)
Great family 💯💯
Good remembrance thanks for sharing this private moment with us and the world
I cried. A family who loves each is a blessing from God.
All political views aside, this eulogy is beautiful, when he breaks down, that shows just how much he loved his Dad, rip Mr President ❤
Just want you to play with me.
What a beautiful speech.  May he Rest In Peace ❤️🙏🏼
God called home a very good man who will be very missed by all... regardless of political affiliation! Number 41 may you rest in peace with your daughter while holding The Family Enforcers hand in yours. 

Number 43, I had the honor of living in the great Lone Star while you were Governor.   I also watched as you became our President! You gave your father an excellent farewell.   My heart is filled with grief but strong in faith to Jesus Christ.  I stand with you and the entire Bush family and want you to know that you are loved, admired, and blessed.  Great Job Sir!  

I proudly salute George H.W. Bush! God bless you
May you rest in peace ❤️
Oh gosh, that ending.
President Bush, we love you be strong
Die young as late as possible 😪 Rest in peace Sir. 🙏
Thoughts and prayers to the Bush family, beautiful eulogy.
The Ayatollah should do Carter's eulogy next.
That was the most "human" I've ever seen him be. Very touching. Bless.
Very moving and the ending was wonderful … R.I.P. Mr. President
Beautiful!😢
Beautiful loving eulogy
Makes me want to go and hug my father.
God Bless America. RIP President George HW Bush
Paragraphs of historically reports of happiness and tears during a holy  worthy miserable lifetime inside our beings.

Beautiful  eulogy. Rest In peace
Bravo. Best eulogy anyman can receive from his son.

Beautiful speach
When a man cries...it's humbling
What does truth bring in a moment like this? Tears that this family's will grow even closer.  May Almighty God by His Spirit bring you comfort and peace.
R.I.P. G.W! We love you!
LMAO 😂😂😂 I like how they turn the camera to Bill Clinton at 5:18 when he says “Faith and Family”
Two friend and co-worker of mine were the son and daughter-in-law of Van Standifer, the founder of Midnight Basketball League and friend of GW.
I had the pleasure of viewing photos of my friend waltzing with GW at a White House Ball.
She said GW was beyond kind and gentle.  
Seeing those photos was thr first time how tall he was.  I wish I could have met him.
People die everyday. We’re all human
Amazing what the fear of death will d ok to the mind and others that feed off it for the pursuits of LIVING.
This maggot should be shot!!
I can’t wait for the day we’ll be listening to the Clinton’s & Obama’s eulogies!  GOD BLESS YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!
When body bags arrived back home from the war (weapons of mass destruction)    did ever THE SON  EVER WEPT ?
No now defaults don't have any wear to hide oh no default stay back
The clergy look like they're  contestants on the Price is Right.
Won't you play with me?
I just wish... we could get along. All the gentlemen and the ladies are going away. Made me cry.
Very touching eulogy from his son to his Dad rip Pres GHW Bush
9:12 to the end😢❤❤❤❤
12:18😢😢
Im starting to like politicians based on values and less about politics
now he is finally  meet his maker we all will someday
😂 I thought there was only 1 bush
such a great speaker
I don’t think I would have 5 people at my funeral. Look at how many people paid their respects to this man. Massive.
I thought this was a press conference for the  evidence of iraq's weapons of mass destruction
So beautiful.
LOL He does not deserve this.
As a person who lost my dad at age 15 and my mother in May i can relate to W s humor and tears beautiful speech W.
RIP 41 & much respect 43 my condolences to your family!
Love 🇺🇸
Rest in peace President George Bush thank you for your service and thank you for being my president
Well spoken. 😢😢😢im so sad for his death
This was absolutely beautiful.  I always liked W even though I disagreed with him at times.   I voted for him twice and would do it again.
Rip  cenioir bush
He might not have been the best president but he sure loved America with all his heart
I’m not crying you are 😪
RIP President Bush. Such a great family. We all should take lessons from them.
Wow everyone is there.  Trump, Clinton, and Bushs
bush had no honor and all his crooked family
Moving  eulogy , warm and full of humour and love... tears here as I think about my own dear dad
God speed mr presdient
Inset distracting pictures for “the news” is complete disrespect for the man delivering his Father’s eulogy.
What a surprise from “the news”
My deepest condolences to the family. George W. Bush. You, Jeb are in my prayers. Your father fought well to keep our country peaceful and safe. This a beautiful and touching eulogy that you've written. Your father was very proud of you becoming President.
rest in peace big dubya
To loose his father is brutal - there is no different about beeing  a president, a doctor, or a worker - it leaves you in tears
The Dalai Lama said that George W. Bush may have not been the best president but that he is a great person, I think this just further proves that point.
The mainstream media can turn villains into heroes, and heroes into villains.  Amazing to watch so many amnesiac Americans just repeat whatever the news tells them to think.  

"Sarah, if the American people ever find out what we have done, they would chase us down the street and lynch us."   -George H. W. Bush  to Texan journalist Sarah McLendon, 1992.
Lmao look at trumps face
That’s was so sweet ❤️
I wish I could love this instead of just like it. I’ve always loved the way that family holds theirselves, they’re very humble. Rip George H.W. Bush
Can you start to imagine what the heck they'll say about Bill Clinton? lol lol OMG
Rest in peace.
This made me cry. I was in the same position as him when I lost my dad last year and had to make a speech for him at his funeral that I was hard to do. Also brought me memories of my father. George w. Bush did good job remembering his father and mother. RIP George H.W. Bush
So moving, beautiful speech 😢😢😭😭
Rest Easy Sir. I would like to thank all of the Bush family for thier service and sacrifices for our country.
W gave a great eulogy about Papa Bush. Papa Bush was a genuine man of great integrity who was well-mannered and thoughtful. Both Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush were great Presidents.
How awkward it must be for Clinton, Obama and trump to be be all in the same bench
Beautiful Eulogy indeed..
An ex President eulogizing another ex President
I just love how the camera zoomed in on Bill and Hillary C.
They’re such of a great family, bless them during this time! This made me laugh and cry, Rest In Peace.
Good lord it must have been awkward to see President Trump next to Former President Obama - I know I felt the edge lol
No words could describe the love of the father and his child. The meaning is too deep.
Beautiful sincere moment. The Bush and Ford Family and Lady Bird Johnson Family seems to have a genuine family bound. Where was the Kennedy' s and Johnson Family Representatives? Nixon family Representative usual invited?
I doubt he spent his last hours in peace. Thinking of all the evil he did. He escaped justice here on Earth but cannot escape Hell.
I never was crazy about the bush family. But that last minute of that speech completely ripped me.
Well, I was never a Bush fan, but at least I really think, that this family has their morals straight and are human beings, miles apart from the Trump family
R.i.p.great man
Donald Trump at 0:24 seconds.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏
Beautiful.
I sincerely hope president pumpkin was not in attendance
Humility
Rest In Peace Mr President.
Thank you Mr president 4 being here! N thank da Bushes 4 inviting him!😊 RIP HW BUSH
A lovely eulogy from a son to his father.   Very nice.
We all know the feeling when you lose your dad and you never for get
Rest in peace champ,,,,
9:58 That's too bad. I like broccoli. Its like my favorite vegetable.
I really like how this is funny and not self-serious and boring.
RIP BUSH SR
Beautiful
Look at the Clintons looking so happy
for all of the nutty liberals who characterized Bush 43 as evil... Think again... Not a mean bone in the Bush Family a family of profound class, dignity, respect and humility.... Thank you Presidents 41 and 43..
So, the "weapons of mass destruction" gives a eulogy for the "new world order".
Rip h.w.
War criminals. Mass murderers
6:54 "Jeb is a mess... Jeb is a mistake" XD
3:28, PAUSE IT, WHAT ARE THOSE EYES FOR!!!
10:43...............you know Trump's thinking "I'm gonna make him pay DEARLY for that one!!!!!"
Beautifully delivered.
Why does he laugh at the end? At least that’s what it looks like to me but maybe he’s crying I don’t know 12:55
Btw good eulogy.
It was great to see George Soros among the people.
Does Bill Clinton ever close his mouth
I love how trump always has his arms crossed like a petulant toddler. Or like an extremely insecure teenager.
Finally went to hell for what he did in Iraq vietnam
Rest In Peace
🙏 RIP God bless them all
Met zo'n mooi leven is dood gaan niet erg.
RIP Mister H.W Bush.
Hail To The Chief
Beautiful 💖
I still can't decide if the Bush family members are shills for the new world order that H.W. once endorsed. And I don't trust people who belong to secret societies and who lie. I am referring to Skull and Bones as well as H.W.'s famous "no new taxes" promise.
Hahahah hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
that's awesome what a great life with tax payers money...I'll eat some peanut butter sandwiches
President Bush your dad is a great dad not just not be still is. I pray that God recieves him with open arms. And to you and yr family May God be with yor family  alway. Another angel in heaven.
@that guy please for the love of all things sacred stay off the comments section!  You literally have stated the same stupidity everywhere on this thread!  People like you need to STEP AWAY!  RIP Mr. President.
I wonder if Trump even knew what was going on, and if he DID know that it was a funeral, did he know who it was for?
RIP Mr President .
Poor Jr. Sorry for your pain Sir.  Count tour blessings that you had your dad at your side all these years. many of us are not that lucky.. guess money does  buy you a long healthy life
You could tell Jeb was crying around  12:55. Red as a beet, and that micro breath reset at 12:59
car dumping in the lake ? come on dont be coy... :)
RIP George H.W. Bush and God bless the Bush family...:) ...broccoli never set  well in this family either ....Such a wonderful family...
"Bush did it"
So many clueless and heartless people in this thread.
Murders thats all
Very sad... My condolences
George snr was old school and showed great humility,and to see jnr crack shows we’re all the same really out of our roles.god rest amen Sir
"Distinguished guests, family, friends and Comrade Trump...."
Bush Sr convinced me to become a Republican.  The first time I voted for a Republican was for him. I'm now a Conservative Republican.  So he changed my life without ever meeting me
All this eulogizing and white-washing about the "Good old days" of H.W. Bush conveniently leaves out a terrible legacy. 

Remember - the Iran-Contra scandal in the early 80's, under Bush-Reagan, in 
which U.S. sold arms to Iran, then used that money to support radical 
leftist rebels to overthrow the democratically elected govt of 
Nicaragua, just so Americans could continue to have cheap labor and 
bananas from Central America. These same illegal immigrants today are 
clamoring to enter the U.S. under political asylum, due to political 
instability in their own countries, thanks to Bush's legacy. 

Or 
the medal H.W. Bush gave to Navy commander William Rogers III, who 
recklessly entered Iranian waters against international law in 1988, and
 ordered Flight 655 to be shot down in his aggressive blood-lust 
-thereby killing almost 300 innocent passengers midair, including 66 
children. H.W. Bush said on several occasions -"I will never apologize 
for the United States — I don't care what the facts are..." So much for a
 man of integrity and God. Wonder why Iran also hates the U.S... 

Or
 those thousands of innocent Iraqi children who died violently in the 
Gulf Wars - their heads, torsos, arms, and legs exploded and 
crushed by the tonnage of falling buildings from U.S. bombs, because of 
an engineered Lie, whose downstream consequences later lead to further 
hatred of America by the survivors, and rise of ISIS. 

Let's not 
forget the fabricated "War on Drugs" that led to incarceration of 
thousands of young men for the possession of weed. You know, the same 
shit that many states have deemed legal and medicinally beneficial ever 
since. 

These politiicans actually believe their Lies and godless
 actions are justified. Folks, there is no difference between democrats 
or republicans, or their elite criminal friends. It's all the same crock of
 shit - about power and money, not about innocent lives, God, or 
"American values". If there truly is a God (and I believe there is) 
-During Judgement, all will be revealed, and All accounts reckoned with.
 You can't hide the Truth from the Creator.
On his watch
Dam globalist
And not one word about God .......Way is Narrow , Few will Find
He crash me 💔😭💔💔💔🇺🇸
Sorry to the Trump always supporters, but Trump's body postures are always incorrect every single time.
President Bush, We loved that you wept. We know you are human.
Whitewashing the character of a war criminal. His son, "Dubya" was also a war criminal. Americans are so gullible and easily brainwashed. None of the Bush's deserve respect. Get real!
he saved a nation and a country Kosovo, i am a witness, R.I.P
🙏 R.I P.
AN AMAZING PERSON AND A GREAT AMERICAN JUST DIED. THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE AND GOD BLESS YOU FOREVER AND EVER IN HIS ALMIGHTY PRESENCE REST IN PEACE DEAR PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH.
being nnative  texasian   i  wouldnt  feel right not  showing  up  they  dont  know   texaian   well
Draft dodger, and false patriot Donald Trump should takes notes. He’ll have a lot of time to think when he’s impeached, imprisoned, or loses in 2020. Mueller will be a national hero, just like Bush Sr., who’s bravery, and patriotism will never be forgotten.
Oh May he RIP Dad an President Bush he was a Father fo The Whole World May Good GOD Protect Him an his Wife..May Lord be with his Family n give u Guy's Strength n Make u Strong Jesus Christ Name Amen...With Much Much LOVE!!!
Read My Lips
RIP PRESENT BUSH
I heard bush did 9/11
🙏🕊🌹
RIP, but seeing Hillary's face just made me think of a lizard, can't put it any other way. She looks so creepy.
yes unce bartmure tuner   tuners  neice   uncle  wikie  nicie   little  chrissy
Bush did 9/11
هجولو فيه وهو ميت من مدينه لمدينه
I wish I could go and send 1/2 of the elite to kill the other 1/2 of the elite, and then profit from the war.  Then on my death have the mass of people kindly eulogize me.
Today everyone says its so sad, such an American he was. 100 years from now they're gonna say he didn't do a damn thing about climate change.
Rest in peace.
Its should have been Trump): rip
11:44 ❤❤
R.i.p 😢
ONLY HEARTLESS,💔 MISERABLE, 😖UNHAPPY, 😟 LONELY, 😐 PEOPLE would find No Enjoyment in such LOVING eulogy, giving it 👎SAD! 😢 I'm Truly Blessed🙏 I'm not them! 🤗
I wonder how many fathers he and his father killed. How many kids he left without a dad. 
We shouldn’t judge about the dead, that’s right. But we shouldn’t deny the crimes which took place in their time. 

Thousands of INNOCENT people. 
Kids, women, the ill and the healthy were murdered. 
Absolutely slaughtered. 
Just because they live thousand of miles away doesn’t make their death less gruesome. 
It’s how it is.
A great man. He may not be perfect but we can see from his family that he’s been a good father to his children and a faithful husband to his wife and thus a good president to his country.
Anyone else notice When he mentioned ladies of the evening , Ol’ bill clinton looked around and asked where?  Lol
No matter if we are republicans democrats or independents we all need to be united as Americans and the bush family taught us about family life and love ❤️ Rest In Peace #41 you'll be missed but I know your happy to be with the love of your life and your daughter Robyn in heaven  and I'm sure there will be plenty of vegetables in heaven. This was a beautiful service.
One of the most beautiful eulogy of Walker Bush, giving speech about his greatest iconic father Herbert Walker Bush have ever known. Mr. President 41st, George Herbert-Walker Bush, was and always will be (in my heart) the one truest American Hero. George Herbert Walker (and fellow son, and US 43 President George Walker) Bush. Once again, I’ll always have President 41 and his beautiful wife of 73 years a part of my heart, and always cherish these precious memories. Rest In Peace Mr. President 41, and Mrs. Barbara Bush.
He celebrated 911
Political differences or not.  Our former President George H.W. Bush dedicated his life to service.  He served our country.  He helped so many people.  President Bush led by example.

I'm saddened by the current state of our country's politics.  The current state of our nation's capital is in disarray.  Our White House is filled with hostility, unprofessionalism and extreme rhetoric.  Conspiracy theories and lies have warped the minds of many fellow Americans.

Even though this is a sad event, there is a current sense of decency, normalcy and professionalism in the room.  As I look at all of the former Presidents, I feel a surge of pride and honor.  It is wonderful to know that Carter, Clinton, Bush and Obama will continue the philanthropic achievements of George H.W. Bush.  The flag over the President's casket, the men and women in uniform along with the former Presidents and First Ladies give me hope that professionalism will return to Washington.  

To see George W. Bush saddened by his father's death as he gave the eulogy tugged at my heart.  God Bless him.

Heavenly Father I humbly asked that you touch the Bush family and give them strength.  In Jesus name, Amen.
Love.
George W. Bush eulogized his father beautifully. Truly a remarkable family that shows love honor and humility. People can sure learn a thing or two from The Bush Dynasty the true definition of an American with value and morale. R.I.P #41
Trump, not to pick on you again, but will you be remembered like George or any of the others?  Around 11:50 it looked like he was beginning to close up and walk away...
You and your father killed millions of people around the world and now you are  crying for your father it doesn't make sense George W Bush
Nojmul Hoque
I really don’t understand why he’s not next to the Mother and father bedside when they passing away,only phone call?
I've seen George W get emotional twice; once after 9/11 and today.
REST IN PEACE PRESIDENT BUSH SR.
😭😭😭😭
I'm thinking that this is a half eulogy and half ripping Drumpt telling him what it is to be a President and father. Was beautiful though.
😭😭😭😭
Where some people have a father, W. has a Dad. I haven't always had that relationship with my own father. It took my mother's passing for it to happen. Seeing this and Sully the service dog at the casket choked me up no end, especially given my unconditional love of Labs.
I was sobbing throughout this entire service. I simply saw it as the funeral of a father, husband, and service member. I'm completely in awe of this man's incredibly rich life. I was born1990 so of course I have no conscious knowledge of him or his presidency, but when you lose an admirable parent, friend, comrade, etc., someone who all sorts of people speak of in high esteem, it guts me like a knife. Bush came as his son here, and only as his son. RIP.
ok guys its enough. this has been the news for days now. its over. show us things that matter.
😭😭😭
Saluting all surviving Presidents 4 all the hell you’ve left this pitiful country in. As much as my heart has been moved still doesn’t excuse the condition this world is in. peace 2 the WORLD 🌎 4 Gods sake.
You dont celebrate a death.....
With the exception that GHWBush was a great president towards the end of Jr's speech, which I hated Senior as Potus, the rest was very touching and humorous. Not fond of the Bush family & I hope never to see another Bush POTUS in my lifetime, I genuinely feel sorry for the Bush family loss.
Very touching speech,hopefully Trump learned something.
41 was truly a great man.. my parents were democrats and when I was young he was president.. my parents bashed him constantly.. as an adult I didn’t really know much about 41, I was young when he was president.. but now I know what a truly great man he was.. this was heartbreaking, can’t not cry
I’m touched by the last words, “Dad’s with Robin, and holding mom’s hand again.” Long love stories will continue, he misses her too much, so he comes to find her and his young deceased daughter
Hello
Dubya knows how to honour his daddy
A thousand points of light



Read my comment 
NO MORE TRUMPS!!
H.W. was a gentleman.  Maybe one of the last great presidents.  Him and Reagan both had great senses of humor and H.W. wasn't a fan of 'reaganomics' which makes me like him more than Reagan even.  Even though he broke a promise and raised taxes. He did it for the good of our economy.. for our country.  It's hard to imagine 'you know who' doing that.
RIP SENIOR BUSH
Although his eulogy was probably the best one i've ever heard in my life, it doesn't excuse the fact that George W. Bush is a war criminal who should be executed for the thousands of people he has killed from home and abroad.
Fake news
President Bush Jr. a very very nice eulogy and I am sure your dad was listening and laughing too . Please look after his dog Sunny . By the way I will always remember you for your jokes and humour . My prayers to you all in this time of grief.
LOL!
so sorry
No matter if you're conservative or liberal, that was beautiful. A man saying goodbye to his father. A man who was President for two terms and breaks down, knowing cameras are on him and a Nation is watching. That is family. RIP President George HW Bush. Mommas been waitin for ya
SENIOR BUSH IS AN EXCELLENT  EXAMPLE  OF A FAITHFUL AND DEDICATED HUSBAND.  MARRIED TO ONE WOMAN FOR 72 YEARS, AND FAITHFUL TO HER ALONE, OH MY LORD,  THEY DON'T  COME LIKE THAT ANYMORE,  HE IS A RARITY. RIP MR. PRESIDENT, HATS OFF TO YOU.  YOU SET THE BAR VERY HIGH,  WHO CAN COME CLOSE???

Good job little Bush in the shades way showing that garbage Trump how to be a real President,man and human!
Most evil
Presidential family... why does the country has to shut down..? Nobody cares. He and his family destroyed the country and its people 👹👹
The guy had honor. No matter how people feel he had honor. And what I like was how GB 1 said how his father loved everyone.  That is the keys to America is that we love one another. Let us not let his death be in vain. He loved the Clintions he love the Obama he just loved everyone. ANd that is the greatest commandment that we love one another
My deepest sympathy  to the ex-President of Estados Unidos of America.  I'm sorry for your loss.  Thought it was your Mom's funeral but it's your Dad.  the world's condol and mourn the country...
Kudos for the Video clip! Apologies for butting in, I would appreciate your opinion. Have you considered - Schallingora Publicity Extracting Scheme (search on google)? It is a smashing one of a kind guide for learniing amazing eulogy speeches minus the normal expense. Ive heard some interesting things about it and my m8 after a lifetime of fighting got excellent results with it.
Condolences to The Bush Family. Absolutely a beautiful, memorable n inspiring funeral. It touch my ❤️  America mounrs your loss.  Thank you for your service Mr President H W Bush.  God Bless. Rest In Peace #41.
Mr Choo, you're right.  It has nothing to do with the past presidents, nor their spouses.  It's to celebrate Bush's life.
RIP
Great eulogy
Democrats and liberals demonized and called Bush Sr. every name in the book was when he was alive.  Now in death, these same Mutts claim to admire, respect and mourn him.  You Subhumans should be ashamed.
I was born when George W. Bush was president, grew up when Barack Obama took office, and now observe as Donald Trump carries on with his presidency. We may all have differing opinions of all three of the people that I mentioned, but this very video just shows the love that a father showed to his family and his country. I don't care if you are Republican or Democratic, I care if you will just take a moment to put politics aside, and remember a Father and a Husband who wanted nothing more than to make his family proud and who tried his best, as all presidents do. May you Rest in Peace George H.W Bush,  thank you for your service to this country, and thank you for loving your family and friends as yourself.
This is just another corrupt politician getting the whitewash treatment: Embalm, cherry-pick a life narrative, marinate in vacuous sentimentality, and all the guests slip back into the DC swamp to feed at the public trough.

What raises this particular service a few notches beyond the norm is its an attempt to rehabilitate Jr. who was neither a "war hero," nor a marginally competent president.  Secondly it lets people who hate Trump love on a mediocre dead republican president so they can make their Trump hatred seem less partisan and more principled.

Thank God we didn't get Hillary or Jeb(!); talk about dodging a bullet!
A TRULY GREAT MAN OF AMERICA PASS AWAY BUT HIS HEART REMAIN TO US...MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE.....I DID NOT BORN DURING YOUR TIME AS A PRESIDENT BUT LISTENING THRU NEWS WAS ABLE TO KNOW YOU....I WAS IN GRADE 4 WHEN JR. G.W.H.BUSH PRESIDENT IN U.S.A. PHILIPPINES
oh please ,,he was a war mongering profiteer, why is it that every one who dies is suddenly beyond reproach,
you know... if someone out of this world heard you talking about your father he would think what an angelic guy he was!! all the world knows he is a war criminal... as well as you.
What in the world I s going on with Bill Clinton's mouth?
Trump does not look and in any way
George W Bush and his son  are war criminal. Both of them will rotten in hell.
bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal, bush was a war criminal,
All the rumors, all the speculation, I just don’t know.  While I believe that HW committed crimes against this country and humanity, we don’t know the reasons for his crimes.  After I heard of his passing, I asked God a question, and the feeling I got was one of utter and complete peace.  I believe he was forgiven and is now with our creator.  So, all that said, if God can forgive, who are we to not?  RIP Mr. Bush.
Dr. King Schultz:
''But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it. Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do. I kill people and sell their corpses for cash. This corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. Now, quit your pussyfooting and shoot him."
Nobody will be upset when trump leaves this earth.  He’s a terrible person to his very core.  Complete hypocrite and as dumb as it gets
Stockholm syndrome much!...get therapy people!!! these parasites are genocidal sociopaths and your paying your respects! Thats not normal!!!
all these here commenting about Bush is a joke.
Where were all these emotions when he bombed the hell out of Iraq on false pretences. This war criminal killed many sons' fathers you will ever care to count and caused so much grieves to millions. War Criminal
Has he thought about his decision to send the troops to Iraq to bring blood and tears to the families of middle East? Although he cried for his father, I hope he could have sympathy for those innocent lives died in vain due to his decision.
Bush did 7/11
Good riddance
Massive place to worship could have feed a country for  the price of that waste of space.
Ņ  I
I always loved George 43. I voted for him. I did not vote for Bush 41.
Alles Hurrensöhne... alles Show...ich hätte den alten Sack schon vor dem Vietnamkrieg getötet.... einfach lächerlich... Alles Verbrecher 🖕🏻
«Huge war criminal honors recently deceased war criminal»
RIP Mr President
9/11
What a disgusting family. Well good thing is that he is now where he belongs. IN HELL.
You know this Old Native American do not care if you are Republican or Democrat or a Libtard or  progressive they are just all titles given by the White Race ...  Every since the White Race got here and stole our land from Canada and Alaska and all of the America's all you have done is lie and Cheat and Steal ...  Every President past and present and if there is a future  all have a Agenda  force small little race war's and put rich against poor arrest people of color maybe even shot a few just for funnies ....  Everything every President ever said was and is a lie they all hold secret prisons just for people of color also places they experiment on people of color strait out of Nazi playbooks....  I hope and prey the entire White Race all die and soon with everything they have caused in the world.... I am glad Bush senior died  now the rest of the President's need to die .... And every one of color know's they are all part of the illuminate .....  The entire White Race was also created by the Nephilim and the Annunaki up on the Caucasus Mountains of Russia .....
I'm republican and I reckon that we should honor those who sacrificed their lives for the bad decisions that this family got us in. Yes! I understand that he was the president but he does not have higher status than those thousand who died for his son stupid wars.
Rest, In, Sulfur...
my,my.... so many idiots on one page
where's those weapons of mass destruction...nope non here, how about here....nope non here
It looks like George Bush is giving a speech to a retirement home. The audience looks not only old but heavily medicated too. Who else agrees?
To the Hell!
RIP George HW and Barbara Bush
War Criminals
To the Hell!
Family of murderers
Bill Clinton appears senile for sure looks lost .
MASS MURDERING BASTARD GONE,THANK GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank You MR Bush!!  We may never be able to reverse the damage you and your father caused.
 RIP to the Millions of lives lost in America and Abroad because of the Bush/Clinton crime syndicate. 
-RIP America
Hell is earth if your not rich. Heaven is when we die. Because than we are all rich.

President George H.W. Bush
 was sued by 53 members of the House of Representatives and a single 
U.S. senator in 1990 amid Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The lawsuit, Dellums v. Bush, sought to block Bush from attacking Iraq without getting approval from Congress. this was is a violation of constitutional law . with his oath he violated  ....now he faces GOD for judgement
Speechwriters are a dime a dozen in D.C. they also do weddings and everything else in between.
Shouldn't you first mourn for the thousands of people you killed?  Murderer.

How can a murder even be inside of a church????  Doesn't one of the Ten Commandments say "Thou Shall Not Kill"???
Go to hell the father and later the son
Damm thats a lot of PeckerWoods!, wait where is Satan?, O he's there you just cant see him working those puppet strings.
Hw was executed by lethal injection for treason you fools !
Maybe Dubya should look under his coffin and say, "Nope, no weapons of mass destruction there!"  Then we could all have one good last laugh at the expense of the millions those two caused to die.
I'm hoping the first person he meets in hell is Saddam.
Trump 2020
Unfortunately many Americans still love the current president. Forgetting the values of the presidency. Trading goodness and values for the current rhetoric of hate and divide.
Bush and all his supporters can go to Hell.
Omg, people are so brainwashed it's painful to watch this and read those comments...What about the tears of the millions of children whose parents have been murdered by those two monsters? You're just pathetic
Yay! Can’t wait till you follow ur dad and Mom to HELL!
Bush family are traitors
Absolutely death is sad,  but I'm not shedding a single damn tear for that family.  The list of horrific and corrupted things that family is responsible for.   From George Sr with his oil and time as the CIA director,  to his presidential reign of terror and then this half wit son...  Made a mockery,  a joke out of every American.  Between those 2 bastards WITH their unjustifiable Wars, THE WOLD IS BETTER WITHOUT THEM...  let's not do this,  when a piece of shit dies,  and everyone pretends that they were greatness...  That's a lie and absurdity!!
This was so touching, I couldn't finish it. It brought me to the point of puking in the toilet. One day some will learn what this family has done.
George W. Bush you can cry all you want but those crocodile tears won't go away; from your countless wars you waged on Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc. Millions of innocent souls were killed and you will be judged for it in the day of judgement
Nice, But Bush family is the family war not needed and opiates.
I don't how will trump eulogy will be, don't know how someone will do it honestly and the truth.
War Criminal Jr. eulogized his War criminal father.
Good riddance, purveyor of evil. 🖕
terrible president
WAR CRIMINALS
