Sweet . 💝
This is wonderful news. I only wish the best for the happy family. Lady Diana must be smiling from up above. Both her sons now have families.
I have to say this is my favourite royal marriage. I love that it has broken so many stereotypes
Congratulations and Happy Birthday to the new baby boy ,the family getting bigger,,, I know he can olny be a handsome little man, :-)
They are such a beautiful family!!!
Why the media always point out by racial. .. A baby is a baby stop putting a brand on him already. I hate the media such mess
As a dog lover I like the name Spot
Good job congratulations
Muchas felicidades a la pareja ideal. Que Dios los llene de salud, amor, sabiduría e infinitas bendiciones para todos.  Muy buenos días 🍀😘☘️💯☀️❤️
Wake up PEOPLE
Look ! how happy he is.... 😄😂
The one talking at 1:07 is my teacher and he was just walking past and did not know about the Royal baby
So happy for them. Know princess dianas looking down.
I can't get over the sad, no-class comments being posted here.  A healthy child is breathing his first breaths in the loving arms of his parents....LEAVE THEM ALONE, CAN'T YOU!  Are you so unhappy that you find it necessary to dump on this young family?!  Shame on you!
Well done - non-speculative commentary for a change. Perfect footage that includes Princess Diana!!!!
Will they move to America???
Congrats
I loved that he acknowledged that what women do is amazing!😍😍😍 Giving birth is no easy feat, love a man who pays homage to that. Btw this is not the first interracial royal in Britain's history just the first to be acknowledged as such. Congrats guys. 😊❤❤
What’s the baby’s name
Edit look at the time that I wrote the message I wrote it in the first 2 hours
Emotional ❤️❤️❤️ congratulations 👪❤️❤️❤️
ARCHIE IS THERE A ROYAL IN THE PAST WITH THAT,NAME. KING ARCHIE PRINCE ARCHIE DUKE ARCHIE..LORD ARCHIE. DESNT RING A BELL. ARCHIE MY THE WAY  IS....A MEMBER IN
Congratulations
I wish the media would mention prince Charles as well, Im sure he is a wonderful grandfather.  Why only focus on diana?
Congratulations to both parents ♥️
Your Alliance must be at its end if you're sending your children after me. I will watch intently, so that your royalty knows the price of its continued defiance.
Congrats on the thing that will be bullied into suicide before age 3
Congratulations to you guys.
ANYTHING TO DISTRACT !!!!
So happy for them.
CONGRATS FOR MARRYING A B GRADE ACTRESS, WHAT DOES HE NAME HIM-GROLLYWOOD
I love them❤
My teacher was in the video he was the one with the dark short beard and he was with a woman who had blonde hair
Look at every other news agencies  comments of happiness and congratulations,  and then look at Fox News comments. Someone needs to take out the trash lol.
👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dman,the baby is lucky
In a luxury lobster/champagne hospital on a tax payers money while UK healthcare in crisis. Typical Narcissist
Congratulations
It is necessary to hear GOOD news every now and again... Congratulations Harry and Meghan!
🤣🤣🤣 um ok ... so many people
I knew  the secrecy wouldn't last long! Every new parent wants to show their baby to the world even non-royals! Of course WE ALL have the most beautiful baby in the world!
0:38 BELLOW it wh don't ya! Like you were born utter those words!🙄🙄
Their new baby will be star in the royal family
Why do they keep referring to Meghan as Meghan Markle? ??
Why not Prince Harry and Meghan!
Just because the Prince has no last name doesn't mean you should keep using hers.
I was a Princess Dianna Fan. I am a big time Harry fan watching him grow up (little rebel) from the states side. It was amazing seeing the happiness in his heart for his first born. His Mum would be proud.
Why GOD bless America? not  Uk?
Lindo Harry eu gosto vcs dois meghan Markli
Baby after mum Spencer mum would love that Harry
Haters eat your hearts out!  A year ago, you all lost your minds about him marrying her and now, not only are they about to celebrate their anniversary but have a child together.
Super danks yes.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
On the front really don't be naive as if they were seeing action pmsl
I wish Diana could have been there. I know she is with Harry in spirit and love for her youngest child. Elton John so wonderfully described Diana with the song "Candle In The Wind" that he re-wrote to sing at her funeral.....Elton John couldn't have done any more to make sure we all remembered and loved Princess Diana.....and now her sons along with their father and step-mom can go forth and make a wonderful life for this little boy who Harry is so absolutely smitten with. 
Congratulations Harry & Meghan, Duke & Duchess Of Sussex on the birth of your first-born son! Whatever he be named will be an honor to all who waited for this birth!!!
Good Night.!GOOD.!
The bitter facial expressions on Nick Ferrari because the Sussexes didn't mention the place of birth you would think they committed a criminal offence. Relax man they are still in awe of the whole experience.
Eu gosto vcs dois
I want to see a baby very close, is he red headed like his father or cute like his mom ?
Congratulations Harry on defiling the entire english monarch with your ape fetish.
HARRY: WE HAD A BOY THANKS FOR CONGRATULATING US.
LGBT ACTIVISTS: HOW DARE YOU ASSIGN A GENDER WITHOUT ASKING THE BABY.
J.K ROWLING: MEGHAN AND KATE WERE LESBIAN ALL ALONG.
Ok
Why are the press rewriting Prince George birth? He was born in the afternoon and we didnt see him until the next day when they left. Only Charlotte and Louis were saw the same day they were born. George wasnt seen for almost 24 hours after his birth announced. The queen didnt show Charles for like a month after his birth.
CEO
You know Kate Middleton is pissed that's its a boy and now all the attention will be on Meghan and Harry kid now.
❤❤💞
Not true. Queen Charlotte was Biracial and so was Queen Philippa of Hainault. Be careful to get your facts straight before uttering words you’ll have to retract later on. Why are these two previous interracial marriages in the British monarchy being kept hidden from the general public and seemingly intentionally so ? Why is it such a bitter pill to swallow that these marriages happened ? Meghan Markle may be the most recent in our lifetime but certainly not the first. For those interested please do a google search for Britain’s previous mixed race royals. Fascinating history that obviously most everyone including historians have chosen to overlook or even deliberately deny.
Let's hope England is still there.. when this boy comes of age...
A black baby with orange hair?
Surely that's not good news.
Great! Now she can stop cradling the bump! 🙄
Meghan Markli Harry vcs dois será bem vindo o Brasil
On another note. A dingo ate my baby.
May God bless the England, and the Monarch.. give them the strength to root out the radical Muslim movement..
Albert, Robert, George.
Not impressed, how about you all get a job and support all these babies you have? Yea,I know, they don't have to.
People here  actually Believe this Is For Real !!Wake Up Sheep !! 🤷‍♀️
Congrats to your new son.  Will the name start with a K or  J like Jerome.
First comment -always wanted to try this😂
Time to 'come' clean, Harry. Time to stop living a monstrous lie. Tell us! Who's your real DNA daddy?
TRUMP'S AMERIKKKA 😤 has No class. That the racism is a damn shame.
Love Meghan with your ENTIRE heart and soul, Harry. She is your mate in more ways than one.  Now, the mother of your son. A very special royal. He is the CHANGE this world has been aching for.  Color barrier has been demolished.
Men cant get pregnant. Who's baby did they steal
Another leech born to a useless family
Slut's live too smooth to believe?!
I mean he’s only a quarter black so...
Wish Meghan & Harry would Please stop taking millions from tax payers. I don’t care what they do with your children but costing millions for your ok looking clothes isn’t someone who cares about the poor. It’s ridiculous. I happen to make a good living but I would never spend that kind of money on clothes if I was on tax payers salary.
Say hello to the antichrist...
good use of tax dollars, good thing uk have no other issues to deal with
We, The World Audience, Really Don't Give A Damn Bout Our Royal Baby Sussex Not Ever-Becoming, King Of England/Commonwealth... #BabySussexIsAlreadyThePrinceOfOurHearts
Prince Harry and Meghan have NO CUSTODY Rights. 
Because the Queen has Full Custody over ALL Royal Children. 
So no child support.
Imagine if the baby ends up looking like Thomas Markle??!!! Lol that would be the best! Boys tend to look like their mothers, and Meghan looks like her dad! That would be the ultimate karma for her ill treatment of him. How stupid, you know, that Doria "the absentee mother" now gets to share in these pivotal moments in her daughter's life, and yet the father who took her of her has been vilified and marginalized. Meghan sucks! But anyways, congratulations to the surrogate for delivering a healthy baby and to the Prince and his hag for the new addition to their family! Byeeee
Who cares? Stop trying to convince us these people are important.
all this in less than a year. he wasted no time getting her pregnant and she's related to them too.
He calls their son “it”
Will the boy be made to use the back entrance..
Black money Queen
I dont get why is this such a big deal, and I thought that only Brits were into it. I guess it's Americans too.
No different than Will and Kate, and the amazing work they’ve done!!! No different than any other mother who’s worked her hard and carried a baby for 9 months and given birth, those are the people who deserve recognition. It’s never been a big deal to me that she’s biracial, I’ve never considered a persons color as something to point out or focus on, unlike her who focuses on her caucasian side~  My gosh people, stop idolizing, it’s a dangerous road to go down.
How media try to make Megan Royal. But she will never be. She has no royal blood, and this baby always will be half prince. She is just regular American woman. And her ancestors were slaves. Come on.
//  ABC NEWS //   YOUTUBE  LICENTIE//  PRINCE  HARRY  AND   MEGHAN  MARKLE    WELCOME   BABY  BOY       CONGRATULATIONS.
I kinda hope it’s black as an eggplant
The little guy should be called "Mohammad" ...... in loving memory of Diana.
I understand they are now calling the baby 'BONGO' - has it come out ghetto BLACK?
The Royal family will one day be blacker than an abo's armpit. God willing Muslim too 😂
Harry loves babies more than Meghan so I'm sure he will be a great dad. Congratulations and God protect that child from all the haters out there.
baby going to look like Obozo jr.
I wish people cared this much, about children in the system. Than about a child's ethnicity, and family. Monarchy out.
I wonder if he's a ginger black kid.
Mug
She probably has had enough children to move on to the second part of her plan.
Why is still this a news? King,prince,queen..oh come on for fuck's sake don't you have other important things to cover
Did they really call him Agon🤔
The prince looks like seth rogen
