I am so sad to lose this breathtaking and historic church.   My heart goes out to the French.
Symbolically all of France is burning. The oppressive tyranny of the Macron regime should take full responsibility.
Crying 😭  right now I’m glad I had a chance to visit it in 2012 on my first trip to Paris. I love Paris and the French, May god bless the people of France 🇫🇷.
My sympathies to the nation of France and the world.....
So tragic seeing this breathtaking, icon destroyed. The sheer scale of the treasures lost is most heart wrenching. Before the fire is out it's easy to see many of the stone walls will need to be torn down and rebuilt because time has not been kind to the stone itself. The soft stone was saturated with moisture from the elements. The heat from the fire is causing the stone to explode as the moisture expands rapidly. Before the night is over walls may fall without the support if the roof keeping them from falling inward.

Luckily the fire crews have, at this point kept the fire from destroying the bell towers. There is fire and water damage to the towers. However they've been saved from total destruction. We may still hear some of the bells ring Easter Sunday. It will be a blessing if the bells toll Sunday.

Thankfully many priceless treasures were saved thanks to the help of hundreds of first responders, the faithful, tourists, and passersby running in and out of the building as fire raged above them. 

As of now 11:30PM local time the fire is close to be contained. Fire crews are in the towers tending to hot spots and stopping flying embers from catching the timbers alight.

My heart goes out to all, like me, whom cherish Notre Dame not just as a religious icon, but as a stunning example of seemingly impossible architecture shrouded in the rich history of France and the world beyond. Let's us all do what we can to rebuild this iconic beacon of Paris for future generations to admire and learn the role Notre Dame has played in over 850 years of  history. The mighty can fall. The people can help the mighty rise up once more.

Cheers!

Vive la France 🇫🇷
It is not an attraction. It is the Seat of the first child of Christianity
@Mr.9. Tell me whose church is not immoral? Can you validate one?
So sad this happened. I hope everyone is okay and I hope it can be fixed up.
You had ONE job, Quasimodo!
Wow...I’m full on crying. 
Such a tragedy....
survives two wars and a power drill kills it.
Easter begun. Aurora!
This is so sad !!! 😢
Prayers to Paris. I went to Paris just recently and it is sad to see a symbol of France burnt to dust. Notre Dame is a symbol of France's History. Prayers to France...
How sad! All he times we've been to Paris this was our number one place to go. The history is just unbelievable. And the statues, altars, paintings hopefully these will be saved as much as possible.
Macron did it lmao 😂😂😂😂
This is totally heartbreaking to see.

I speak french and I can say that she absolutely not translated what the speaker said
Hunchback of Notre Dame
the corner stone is 850 yrs.' old!! set in the dark ages. its survived so much. Hundreds of French conflicts wars and 2 world wars
This is so sad 😭
Coaccident ? Same date 94 years ago communist blew up one more church and kill 200      @ex0M
This is so sad I'm just crying
Crazy flames. Sky is full of heavy smoke. Wish everyone well and keep off smoke. 🌷
Sad such a beautiful building and so much history lost
What a tragedy! I've have never been to Paris, now I'll never have a chance to see this historic site😥
Paris Is Burning"
Rip 😭
So sad to see this
So sad represents French liberation so many sad things going on in the world today some people would say it's the last days
Someone set fire on it or what. Sad.
Mossad Job.
um... ah.... ummm.... aaah... uummm,..
what??
what % of the cathedral was damaged after they contained the fire?
that so sad
sue!
France needs to start fireproofing its other iconic cathedral at Chartres.  The advantage of this happening in France is that the superior artistic taste and technological skill of the French ensures that whatever rises from the ashes will be both breathtaking and fireproof.
😪😢😭
“The gates of hell WILL NOT prevail” - Jesus
who else was watching the live stream?
Is the Hunchback okay?!?!?!
Serapis house burning down.. wonderful👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I cannot believe this 😢😢😢😢😢
They burn this to hide all the evidence and our history from the past
Oh I hope this was not intentional or an inside job as some speculate. I am not French but I am Catholic and this is very heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers are with Paris and France 🇫🇷 This Holy Week will be even more sad. But I hope they can rebuild, although it will never be the same. God be with you and us all!
Let us all stand with France
My favourite and special church ..
This cathedral fire is a tremendous loss to the world and the arts!
☹️😢💔
With absolutely no proof . . . I suspect ISIS.
people have to accept the fact that nothing lasts forever.
it takes me back to the fire in the house of Windsor in 1992. Because Notre Dame is under construction maybe valuable historic items were already removed.
Thoughts and prayers to France
My Heart Is Sad To Watch This But At The Same Time I Am Confident That They Will Save This Holy Place From Destruction And Rebuild What Was Damaged In This Fire For As Jesus Said In The Gospel Of Matthew All The Powers Of Hell Shall Not Prevail Against It.
the Notre Dame is over 850 years old. it was built in the 11th century and is about 10 centuries old. This is a historical monument not just for religious faith, but of art, to a good portion of humanity. This cathedral will not be rebuilt within our lifetime; This day will be remembered in world history.
Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame, from the book by Victor Hugo
, In 2010 academics uncovered references to a "humpbacked" carver in the memoirs of Henry Sibson, a 19th Century British sculptor working at the cathedral at around the time the book was written. The documents were found during a house clearance in Penzance, Cornwall, and are now part of the Tate archive.
"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt (CATHOLICS, which have killed and oppressed multitudes of Christians, and follow the traditions of MEN rather than the truth of the BIBLE) ...He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire."
Isaiah 43:12a,13
What's the insurance carrier on this one? Anyone know?
Historically, there is no price tag on the structure. Still...it may have been insured. 
Remember when isis blew up the ancient buddas...
When ever  i see this i think back to the Halloween  tree and how they rebuilt the beautiful  cathedral  i will neve see it the same way anymore
Wish they rebuilt such beautiful place!!!
air drop the water
not the first "fire".  oh the "holy" catholic church.  so noble, and righteous, and pure...

"...a general processing was made to NOTRE DAME, which the king assisted, intending to testify by this public act the zeal with which he resolved to maintain the religion of his ancestors; confirming it by the frightening PUNISHMENT of multitudes of miserable PROTESTANT...they were FASTENED TO BEAMS WITH A PULLEY AND AN IRON CHAIN, and then successively raised and plunged again into an ENORMOUS FIRE."   History of the Protestant Reformation.  Anne Marsh Caldwell - 1851
This is heartbreaking. Prayers they can save it. What a terrible loss to the entire world.
They’re drawing a conclusion to the cause of the fire saying it was because of construction.Wow that was an easy and quick investigation!!
They wouldn’t have it any other way since it would mean blaming and offending.The shear magnitude and size of the fire is bizarre.The entire cathedral is fully involved.
Bummer
I just hope nobody was hurt.
Third world islamic invaders strike again.
Y can't firefighters get up there?
That just look extraordinary to see that famous church caught on fire yesterday!
Look at the clock... 22:55
😢💔🙏.
Капец... Просто капец... 😖
Das tut wirklich weh...800 Jahre Geschichte sehe ich hier brennen😪🤧
🙏🙏🙏🙏
So very sorry! It meant a lot to the World...So sad..
Haven't the French heard of air tankers?
They don’t know let
For what it's worth,  perhaps some silver lining can be had by salvaging centuries old wood knocked down in storms in the southern United States.  Use a loss to help rebuild a loss.  I grieve at the disaster,  but fire did not take any lives.  What does that say to us?
Good :)
So very expected. Nothing lasts forever. Thank you you Notre Dame for being what you could. They will rebuild you but an era has ended. Thank you and Good bye🌹🌹🌹
This is suddenly becoming “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” Ending.
3:52. You’re welcome
Sorry this has happened but in the end everything in this world will be burned up says God
Notre Dame..............WTC
i hate this.
She calls Notre Dame a "popular attraction". The world is turning satanic. Christianity is dead in France. It was a supulchre.
So much  history  just  lost! I'm  sad! So Sorry,  !!!!!
Oh boy I just woke up from this coma and cant wait to see how my favorite church is doing
Coming so close to Easter suspicions of arson come to mind. If so then who would be most suspect...hmmm...someone who hates Christianity...maybe a group new to France that doesn't hold this place sacred. You figure it out.
Ehh don’t care
C'est fou
HEARTBREAKING
Memes
I hope they can rebuild and save what they can God be with Paris
Just seen a video not very long ago saying that the Cathedral was falling apart. And now it's on fire? I'm sorry but that sounds suspicious to me. I hate that it is burning at this magnitude, but this building will be rebuilt, it's an important landmark, and holy place.
I am french.
Do you guys know what caused the cathedral to burn ?? Prayers to Paris 🙏🏻 I love there 😭❤️🤧
💔
Just some people who did something, the 11 other churches burned this week in France had signs of global warming...
Muslims set it on fire....
Either before or at the time of the JEWISH Messiah's return, the Vatican will crumble as well. Forget about His HUMAN mommy. He is the truth , the way, and the life. He is the Afikomen and Cup of Redemption in the Passover. Try reading Revelation 17.
Would this case be investigated upon with updated information & broadcasted with respect to freedom of speech or would the investigation be brushed under the rug with fear of hate speech, fear of losing more audience & support?
Where are the facts? 
Where are the witnesses? 
How come no one saw this coming?
How come no one tried stopping  this fire immediately? 
Why are many non muslims & modern muslims pointing their finger towards extremist muslims?
Notice how the MSM is not talking about WHO did this? Very fishy. Islam perhaps???
It's not just the roof, it's now the frame of the building which means the Cathedral is a total loss. It's a sad day and a huge unfortunate loss for the world as the cathedral is well known and loved by the world.
Some people are going to be jobless after this mess is over
No reason to visit Paris now!
So are we going to continue to play stupid and blind to the elephant in the room or are we going to finally have a dialogue that involves acknowledgement of certain truths some find hard to swallow..
Under building seven logic, this thing should have collapsed and free fallen into it's own footprint by now.
What other better DISTRACTION WOULD MACRON NEED to divert the yellow vests anger of his treasonous deeds and the rapid demise of his administration! The khazarian mafias r very DESPERATE RIGHT NOW!!!!
Pull it !!!
(Larry Silevrsteen)
They rebuild the cathedral in  pairs and they rebuild the temple of Solomon in Jerusalem what a wonderful year and many more to come
GOD BE WITH PARIS!!! THIS IS COMING FROM A TRUE CHRISTIAN, NOT AN ATHEIST CLAIMING SOMETHING HE IS NOT!!! ALSO, A MONARCHY WOULD UNITE FRANCE MORE THAN A REPUBLIC WOULD!!! God this breaks my heart. Atheist prayers are fake prayers, we need nore Christian prayers, Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox! PRAY FOR PARIS!!!
Its emotional for people all around the world   Cest dommage
The Leader will re build this. Trump Resorts International is already in contact with French officials. It will be Cathedral Trump Notre Dam.
It's unlikely to be ''renovations'', but maintenance and repairs on a many centuries old structure.

God raises up and God brings down!  God is in control!
Izgorilo je ono što je vatra trebala spaliti. Zvonici i ponos Notre Dame bude ostao uvijek, kao simbol snage. Ispod je rimska kripta i temelji rimskih građevina. Na desnoj bočnoj strani  južnog tornja je skulptura Maurice de Sullya. Zvonici budu ostali. Osobito Cloiche! Staklari u francuskoj budu uvjerljivo i precizno izradili stakla, u to uopće ne sumnjam. Zapravo, izgorila je slabost, odnosno onaj dio koji je slab! Izgorila je samo taština, ostalo je sačuvano!
Frollo is to blame for this.  He wanted to burn down all of Paris.
Poor Quasimodo 😭😭😭 #RiP
That's awful
i
Good job that’s what happens when you don’t bully the shit out of your electrical apprentice
This 🔥 happened too close to Easter and we might want to double check Steve Bannon's time-line. I'm not directly saying he started the 🔥 but he's been trying to disrupt France, and build his own building in Paris This was a disbursement of epic proportions. So Paris Investigate any new contractors being added to the team of restoration team. Investigate fully and throughly and benefits from this.
"Streamed live 5 hours ago"..................That's not live.
That's great hopefully the Vatican's next
This is terrible news. May God comfort the people of France and shroud them in His glory during this most saddest day!  Rebuild it! Rejoice His name on the good days as well as the bad!
calm down - they can rebuild
inb4 they build a mosque over it
When the Serb churches burned in Kosovo and Metohija, the firefighters did not extinguish them! And you are one of the participants in the destruction of Serbia for 90 years through economic sanctions! Now Islam will fire you over France!
Muslims stood by watching Notre Dame burn... all shouting 'allah akbar' …..why ?  the fire occurred exactly 1 month post the mosque incident.... why?  and many promise to rebuild the cathedral... and to what god exactly? … humanist? to man's worship of man perhaps? … seems so
HELLFIREEEEEEEEEE
HELLFIIIIREEEEEEEE
sorry not sorry
I guess god doesn't like it when you diddle kids
Step 1: Stage an "accidental fire" at Notre Dame cathedral.
Step 2: Broadcast footage of the staged fire around the world.
Step 3: Hire teams of muslim men to rebuild the cathedral.
Step 4: Every time a native French citizen asks tough questions about immigration, have muslims go on TV and say "We rebuilt Notre Dame!"
I feel that the terrorist events of recent years have shown that mankind is going to be extinct in the near future!
Tragedy or Terrorism????
Perhaps, KARMA is catching up for what the "European" French has done to many non-whites with DESTRUCTION as a return and as just a "beginning".
The year is 2019, April 14th, The French Cathedral,  Notre-dam in Paris.  This Monday, Is being destroyed by fire,  I believe this is a deliberate act of Terror.  Hold fast the dogs of war. Pute aside anger and fear, And bring to justice those who instigated, And the handlers and sponsors of this madness, They are truly depraved.
ahh fire
Luminous meeting gone wrong. The Marathon continues.👁️👁️
When you finally finish building a fireplace in your Minecraft house and place the actual fire down but forget that your house is made of wood.
in tears....terrible news.
Notre flame
20$ says it was Muslim extremists at fault
The diversity hire at the beginning of the video can't even pronounce Notre Dame correctly.

Phonetically, it's no-truh dahm, not note-er dayme.
I guess I better not upload to Instagram that selfie I took of me smoking in the Notre Dame cathedral a few hours ago...
There are rumors that a Muslim extremist set it ablaze....
Babylon The Great City Destroyed......😎☝🏼 The sexual Immoral Church.. one day☝🏼
Jesus is crying.................lol
I'm sure they'll replace it with a big beautiful mosque.
I think it's really unfortunate. I am not at all a Filthy christian or Catholic and i am really feeling empathy for the History and just  plain the Majestic beauty of this church i mean look at it's age alone sad very unfortunate and sad....... DW Spirals
How convenient. Now they can replace it with a mosque.
probably groups on rooftops watching and cheering having a party?
WHITE folks going crazy...
In other news flint Michigan is still out of water
The team sucks anyway.
A church with gargoyles has burned GOOD!
Do the tower? Involve?
the jews & muslims allied with each other & did it
Leave it to the black reporter that can't properly pronounce it. Playing that black card.... Great work
The movie actually premonition
they will build a mosque in its place
100 years and $ 1 billion to restore.
Sins of the Priests who have sodomized so many children going up in flames. Pray for the children..
WAKE UP, CIVILIZED WORLD!!  This is a HORRIFIC act committed by Muslim Extremists!!!
It was probably a Muslim starting the fire haha
It's not a historic site, tourist site, or land mark, that is only incidental to its purpose.  It is a sacred temple made to worship, honor, and give God the Father,  Son, and  Holy Ghost. The Gory and praise  that we owe him.
its islam  they been burning down churches this past week and so on... its not accidental   do not fall for it
Might be an accident... but just before Easter? Something stinks, and it smells like...
ALLAHU AKBAR!
Muslim inflammatory act.
Can someone tell me why the Catholic Church is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild if the structure was insured?
bahahahah hahahahah hahahahah fuck god😂😂😂😂
Praise The Almighty God!! Burn it down!!
Notre dame be like 🗿
muslims are destroying france
Why won't the wizard Jesus bring rain?  This doesn't make sense.
Oh boi isis is back
Lol
Good riddance.
