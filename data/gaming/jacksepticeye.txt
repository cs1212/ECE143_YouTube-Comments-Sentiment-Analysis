Jack, ya silly boy. Now we know you live on earth! Everybody show up at the earths atmosphere
I have a ps4 camera, a $100 canon camera, a forever 21 mirror as a flip screen and a macbook with imovie BUTTTTTTT I have the same ikea broken lamp as jackaboi, mines ain't broken but glad to be among the same top tier high quality mediocrity üëå

Top 3 most sparkliest things:
Diamonds
Glitter
JACKS BEARD
That‚Äôs all good, but can your computer handle 100x100x100 block of TNT getting set off in minecraft?
Imagine being Jack and you're relaxing and you can hear the muffled screams of fan girls in distance....you turn around and see  a group of girls squashed up faces on the window.....
Me: what about the tape on the chair






Jack: DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
1. IMPROVE YOUR CABLE MANAGEMENT




2. Send it to Setup Wars
Jack is straight FLEXXING on us...
FYI kindergarten 2 is coming out in June 2019
I just realized that Jack still did not tear off the duct tape on his chair yet
jack has done his setup tour

Felix... it's your turn
Blue light lamp:

 *looks at Red lamp*
*looks back to jack*
Am I a  to you?
It's a FAKE BACKGROUND!! YOU CAN'T FOOL ME THIS TIME JACK!!
Great video Jack! 
But the real question is...





Is the background real or fake?
Jacksepticeye 2 years ago:‚ÄùI wish I had a full man beard!‚Äù

Jacksepticeye Now: SNATCHED KRATOS‚ÄôS BEARD
Who remembers: 








Guessing phrases in other languages?? ‚Ä¢w‚Ä¢
Oh if only my setup looked this nice... One day, one day it will... :P  Thanks so much for this tour, Sean! Loved it! <3
Pretty Sure The White Board Suppose To Say L A U G H
Plac that says ‚Äúthe office‚Äù. Because this is my office




Edit: I never would of guessed that it was your office!üòÇ
Jack: I hope that you have a good day, ok bye 

Outro: I‚Äôm still a joke to you, ain‚Äôt I?
Hi jack
What screens do you use?  
Greetings from the Netherlands
GREEN BACKGROUND!!!!
You forgot about the green background.
And whit what do you automatlickly get what tou want on the background.
Everyday Jack moves closer and closer to becoming the father
Nobody:
No human:
No soul in the universe:

Jack: Here's my office setup
Jack, Can you do more drum videos preferably drum covers??, also can the song be thousand foot krutch - Courtesy Call??
I use super high end stuff But For myself I don't agree with yt lol
Was I the only one who thought jack was going to say ‚Äú Laugh! ‚Äú but instead said ‚Äúouch!‚Äù ? üòÇ
Make this blue if you love jacksepticeye
üëá(I'm gifting subscribers)
Damn Sean. Even with this whole setup you still don't have the Coke sponsorship.
But honestly for some reason I love when people talk about there setups or hardware.
Edit: Someone's going to say "I'll show you hardware" and I'm honestly just waiting for itüê∫üòπ
Jack, what do you use to record gameplay or anything on the PC in general?
YESS I love computer stuff, and camera stuff, and audio stuff... I'm such a nerd, a moment of realization right here.
Jack: I like doing the standing stuff for
Thinking
Me: Jacksepticeye Funniest home videos,reddit videos,VR games
I love that he still has Spider-Loaf on his monitor!
Just saying thanks so much Sean you at first made me do YouTube. Sure I'm not the best or have the best stuff but playing games is what I enjoy and that's the best part.
Is it weird that I love Jack's new haircut
You are a rich boi I am not üò£üòîüòïüò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Jack looks like Elijah Kamski from Detroit becomes human.
As you can tell, Jack likes to put glitter in his beard.
Wait, how does the greenscreen work? ü§®ü§î
Quick flex with the royalty ram üòÇüòÇ Love u jack
Can we all just respect jack for his cable managment
You know this man swapped out his hentai wallpaper for the making of this video...
What I wanna know is:
WHERE'S THE DRUM SET?
Fan questions.
Dem likes.
Jacksepticeye, how do you do Antisepticeye? Show me how to edit plz! Thanks.
After hearing Sean saying that I don't need all that Youtuber crap, I feel "important" now.
Real background/fake background place ya bets
Show us your samily (Sam family) please üòä
"I'm not going to show you my house"
what do you mean jack?
We live in your house, remember????
We never left....
Is Jack's hair really gray to u guys compared to his beard?üòÇüòÇ
I was just captivated by that high quality beard the entire video.
like a cat and a laser.
Rtx Titian is actually the best right now
Omg I have the same keyboard as jack!
Jack: I use Adobe and  Premiere to edit


Robin: Am I a Joke to you?


Thanks for the  likes!
What are Jacksepticeye's headphones called does anybody know?
Gonna sound odd but I‚Äôve always really liked how Sean‚Äôs mic picks him up in a softer tone when he rages and scoots away from the mic. He‚Äôs right it does add a ‚Äúgenuine element‚Äù and makes the quality better somehow. Anyone else agree?
I don have much time but I'm using my friends account he is in the bathroom can u do me this favor okay my friend is a you tuber and has not made a video for a while cause he thinks he will never succeed can u give him a shout out to boost his confidence cause he is not in the mood to make a video and want to make him happy. And I know you will he has watched you since he was 9. he is 14. Thank you very much Sean.
Jack, you should play Just Shapes and Beats
But you didn't tell us the full specs of your pc. You only talked about the GPU and case.
OMG you getting older or there are stars in your hair
We were ALL WAITING FOR THIS JACK
Jack: talking about Pc specs
Me: confused silence
Jack: keeps going
Me: slams table ENGLISH!
opens door

Jack: "Yo! Welcome to mah crib
Of course people are gonna find where you live. Just follow the screams of the Irish septic boy.
other english speakers:where?
irish people:Hwere?
Great setup! Always good to see how the pros do it.

Do you use a UPS to keep things running if there was a power cut?
JAAAAAACKKKKKK WEEEE HAVVVEEE THE SAME FOOKIN DOORS

Jackseptickeye's Office Setup Tour. More like Irish Boy Flexes PC
All of this shiny equipment, and that blue lamp is like, ‚ÄúFather?!‚Äù Lol poor thing. 



Also, I just realized that the tape on your chair is to cover the green for green screen vids.
Jack... when are you gonna unbox stuff from your last tour? I prepared my stuff for you 4 months in advance... I‚Äôd love to see a unboxing tour gift video from last years tour...
Jack....u didnt show us your search history..
Jack: if I had more lights in the background 
Me: so you can smash them all?
Your pc could power my life support
JACK, PLAY PCBUILDER!

You look a little like doctor strange with the beard
So they streamsniped you irl?
Jack: The computer is a beast, it can run anything



Computer: has trouble loading beamng
What headphone do you use jack?
in the philipines PMA stands for (philipine military academy)
Don't let this distract you when Geico can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
Fascinating to see how professional Jack's gotten over the years :D I still remember his old "setup video" from back at the wooden cabin with the pillows on the walls and all that!  
Any other 2013 / 2014 people around?
Blue lights biggest enemy: jack with VR headset
G-FUEL sponsor this man
Jack , which editing software do you use?
Love the set up but what editing software does Robin use?
Jack: (chair squeaks) OW!

Felix: (THUMP!) BUt CaN yOu Do ThIs?!?!
I have that exact same mouse omg!!!

It has worked really, REALLY well for me for a long time.
Need a new chair though xD Unless the tape is not for covering up damages?
have you ever used a editing software called DaVinci Reslove?
0:52 Jack records in IKEA change my mind
Who does the thumbnails
You or robin?
Hey jack!

Just wondering if u can tell me (or anyone else) what monitors u use and editing software and microphone and recording software ty
Jack's insane.
He basically lives in a padded room
Thank you. I'm 11and I'm starting YouTube. That really helped A LOT!
Can we take a moment and admire Jack's eyes
Gorgeous <3
Meme in the background in the beginning

:Smacks board: LAUGH
You forgot the green screenüòÇ there's tape on your chair for a reasonüòÇ
Based off of how nice the door is your house/set up is beautiful.
Sick setup dude , I like seeing other YouTubers setups, it‚Äôs inspiring.
How do u connect and record your ps4
Sean, may you please make more Subnautica below zero, satisfactory, and/or vacation simulator content. We all miss it and we‚Äôd appreciate it. Love everything you do keep it.üëçüëå
What happened to Satisfactory w/ Robin?
(puts this video on in the background while I do other stuff)
Me:
Jack: (normal Jack stuff, I'm not really listening)
Jack: REGULAR BOWEL MOVEMENTS
Me: wait what
(video ends)
Jack: talks about the power of the graphics card

Me: But can it handle 1000 Mammoths vs 1000 Hiwachas on TABS? ü§î
jacks beard sparkling brighter than my future damn! What do you use on that? üòÇ‚ú®
I'm a total computer nerd, i got rediculously exited at the Gforce RTX 2018 Ti XD Nice compter, tho, jack!
Do you have glitter in your beard?


I sat looking at it the whole intro. ;;)
Yesterday I watched some of your Room tours and wanted to see a new one. And you uploaded what I wanted.... what a coincidence...

Edit: btw the same happened to Bottleflip challenge. I had watched the old one and Felix uploaded a new one the next day
Can't wait until the next episode comes out of Sally face comes out
it seems Jack that you have a better system than me, but I might as well share my setup, I use Sony Vegas Pro 15 cause I find it better suits my cinematicness whether in gameplays or filmmaking, and I use Audacity for my audio cause it's really great for voice acting, I even learned how to make Dalek and Cybermen voices in it, as for a camera, whatever's high quality and portable, a mic? I use a Rock Band game mic cause it's made by Logitech and so it's an actual USB mic despite it being made for an early 2000's PS2 game it has modern day mic quality and it's freakin awesome, it was basically a free mic that came with the game, as for monitor, I use a tv screen for the main monitor cause it's gigantic, nice flat screen tv that's HD, I also use it as a tv, now I don't have a second monitor yet but I'll get one, as for the computer, I'm still trying to find the right kind for me, I wanna get a VR ready computer, as for my seat, I'll be planning to get a couch instead, haven't got the best lights yet, still new despite my channel being 5 years old since May 4th, still trying to figure things out but if you can suggest stuff for me, go right ahead, I don't have much right now
dare you to build me a gaming pc you said you like making pc's :D
RELEASE THE GREEN

Your chair is sad, being hidden from the world!
Sean, you should try like cooking videos!! Like trying to make different meals!! That would be so cool lmao
You look like the father in Farcry 5 (not being rude)
WHERES THE FUCKEN GREEN SCREENNNN
jk lol. Great setup!
any decent quality microphone that cheap for youtube ?
I am very sorry jack for not keeping up for 2 years
Ok,ok you've seen the video,now answer the question:
You are the luckiest person.
Be glad you have that sweet pc!!!

Technically the RTX Titan is stronger than the RTX 2080ti
REEE
You're wrong, the RTX 2080 TI MSI Lightning Z is better and the RTX Titan X is better, but the EVGA is the third most powerful
More drum vids? I‚Äôm a drummer
Jacksepticeye:two computers 
Cartoonz:five computers
Jacksepticeye is now jack samurai xD


The man bun
Wait, hold on! It takes 14 minutes for a office tour? GASP!

Jack forgot to play Real Background Fake Background

I want a basement tour, I am not a cop, you can take my word for it.
Like if he looks crazy in his screen shot
how do you send your camera recordings to your PC if not please reply
Jack haven't you heard that heroes never dye ? ;) 
Or are you just getting getting old ? :D
I love and hate set up videos because it makes me happy for them and yet jealous that they have awesome stuff
Thank you Jack for all this useful information and showing respect for all you fans with what you share on your own YouTube channel. 
Actually,  I have a question that I'm thinking about it alot. The question is belonging to the time you spent editing your videos and  how could you manage your time doing all that stuff alone?? 
I would be so thankful if you answer my question and thank you again for spreading happiness and love to all world.
Regards 
Ahmad AlQattan
i need that graphics card but damn is it expensive

@Jackcepticeye How do you add a face cam when editing or recording? Like how do you overlay it on the video?
All hail the glistening beard of the Gaelic Gladiator!
I thought the Titian was the most powerful GPU
Jack lives with Kratos and Boy in a cabin in the middle of the woods
Jack... you look more and more like your one brother everday. You can definitely tell you two are brothers. Lol
JACK! good Lord man, fix that lamp!! Duck tape that sh*t or somethin' !

Is it just me or does Jack's hair look lighter (and possibly more grey) than normal?
this is literally just depressing to see jack with that PC and I'm sitting here with a 1060 3GB and an i5 7600k lmao

By the way I üß°üíõüíö your channel
Blx4r /a lot of numbers/
JAAAAAACK!!!!! WHAT ABOUT THE GREEN SCREEN!!!!!
my grap card has a dragon on it is a gaming grap card
The question is, which The Office are you a fan of - US or UK?
"Don't let the size fool you"
Do u use one computer for vids and one for editing or one for both
The poor red lamp is there and it can‚Äôt get the attention it wants it‚Äôs always the blue lampü§£
But why no mini fridge? Saves the trip if your doing 8 hours of streaming
His magnificent beard is glistening
Is it just me or is jacks hair going grey?
Also what happened to green chair?
Rocking the man bun
Omg you have the same PC and monitor as me
Jack, why aren't you using an SSD?
I wish i had a setup like that ;-;-
Bro your old hair and no facial hair looked wayyyy better
Isn't the ps5 supposed to have a 2080 ti?
It's so weird that I was actually always curious what your recording room looks like.. I feel like some stalker.. :D
Man your PC is the one I dream of..
But wouldn't a X299 cpu with more cores do a better job at rendering and editing? Just a thought..
What resolution are your monitors? 1080p or 1440p? Awesome setup!
SILVER FOX ü¶ä üëå
whats ur stream deck like
But Jack, what about your monitor specs?
The O in the Origin logo kinda looks like a Septic Eye actually.
For sure, you don't need all this stuff. It might make things easier but it's just something to aspire to have eventually (and he didn't even show everything because I'm pretty sure that's an Elgato stream deck under the left monitor.)
Hey Jack are u ever gonna do more satisfactory?
This would be my setup goal. Unfortunately money and space is an issue üíî
gosh you starled me at the startüòÇ
your beard is SOOOOOO SHINY!!
Mad , ive been subscribed to this channel on 8 different accounts and i first subbed to u at 3k
Well technically the 2080 ti isn't the faster or strongest you on the planet, the fastest GPU on the planet is a Nvidia rtx quatro 8000  it's 50x stronger and faster than the 2080ti and
i feel like im the only one that's here since the wood cabin tour...
You should get an uninterruptible power supply for your setup 1500VA PFC would probably do but even if power may be very stable the minor fluctuations in the power could damage components a little bit quicker or if you lose power even for a few seconds while recording the video would have to be completely redone from corrupt files
Daddy with a top knot ü§§
How did you get them to all connect and form a video?
You don't have the ultimate gamer chair for 399 only, that can do this.... and that .
A Cool setup of tuber simulator.
Heck yeah I‚Äôve been waiting
I'll wait for u to sleep jack. . .

Hee. . .hee. . .hee




. . .Just kidding bruh. . .




I don't even know ur address
Well now we know there's no green screen
How to sneak into the house and say hi to Jack : disguise as a pc inspector.
I feel like Jack is gonna change his yt icon to PMA...
I was wondering what kind of screen recording software you use or would recommend, and also how you record sound from games while having it go through headphones?
And the mysterious green screen still eludes us.
Holy beard care oil!
You look like a Viking SeanüòÇüôÑüëè
Which version of the, The Office do you prefer the UK or US
I love that blue light just hanging there broken while playing Gorn.

your beard is so shiny! It reminds me of looking closely at a superhot character!
Speaking of drums, you ever gonna do more covers? The last one was really good! I‚Äôd love to hear more System Of A Down. Maybe ‚ÄúAerials‚Äù, or ‚ÄúViolent Pornography‚Äù.

Either way, S.O.A.D or not, would love to see more drum covers in general.

Much love. Sincerely, a long time fan.

I searched "Jse Setup" Literally yesterday. I rewatched your old video then I said "I wish Jack made a newer video about his setup.". And you did it... Wow.
His beard is so sparkly in this vid
Hey Jack can you show us your cutter on video please? :)
Started watching you this week and your a absolute legend!!. Love your videos and love your accent üòÇ. Keep up the good work bud :)
Hi Sean, This is a great set up video. The desk is a good touch for when making videos, It's very fancy. Me and my co host too use a levalier mic but not with the reciever we just use an ipod that was purchased and it works just as well. We do also use a mic when Livestreaming which is also amazing. Keep up the videos dude it's always nice to let the fans see your kind of set up. P.S. Love the wire management the wires on my set up are all over the place :')
I can imagine buying a desk like that before realising my cables are too short and everytime i raise it the monitir disconnects.
Its weird to me that he has a studio to record in now, and he used to live in a room and block echo's with a matress.  Time flies by way too fast.
Hey eh has pewdiepies mic quality now
The video has a Pepsi ad
Now make a video of Robin's setup. :D And what monitor stand is that?
Get rid of the Man bun
E L G A T O
That table is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Jack really is becoming peak hipster
Ps. Just put oil in the beard before recording? Respect
Okay I need u to shave jack plz
I really think sean should start a series about computer making or something like that. Just bc he likes talking about it so much. I'd really like to hear and learn more about computers but from sean teaching me xD
I have been waiting for so long
I‚Äôve been sub shins 10 subs
Jack where's your greenscreen
Jack please play super Mario maker 2 plz
Sorry, I was mesmerized the entire time by Jack's beard; it looked so glittery :D
Obviously that computer isn't for sale, but if it was about how much would it be?
You‚Äôre beard looks so sick
You changed from a normal good person to a hipster boy
Make sure you register that assault knife
What ever happened to the drum videos?
The soundproofing on the walls... did you have to glue the squares up yourself or did it come as a big sheet?
How is the green screen atachted?
I just realized that jack has a really sexy forehead
That beard brah! :)
Why is your beard so shiny
I can conclude that Jack's camera quality is better than Felix's
You should send a camera recommendation to Felix
Jack can you play destiny1???

Thank You Sean for your words on You Tubing. I've slowly built up my YouTube channel over three years after getting my Bachelors Degree in Film in 2016 and I'm now reaching a point where I truly feel I am enjoying it. I've almost got my setup that I want and it just...feels good to be able to be myself and entertain people.

Wait i am the  only  one who saw hole in the ear ?
Welcome youtube
Fake background?
Meme
Other than the lavalier mic, I'm assuming, because you are an "energetic boy," you are using an omni-directional mic at your desk? Very nice set up. A dream set up for most of us who do sound and/or video recording, or are aspiring to do so. Only thing with new computers, I'm not a big fan of Windows 10. Thanks for giving us a tour of your great studio set up!
When a rich kid shows his true form.
I‚Äôll tell you what I don‚Äôt understand. What did 209 people dislike about this video????
Your green-screen is on the floor. So how do you get it to stay up and not fall?
I havent really watched jack in over a year and I come back to see him with gauges and a man bun wtf

Very motivative cuz I am new noobie youtuber
It's shit to hear that when you were renting in the past people would just appear on your door step and expect something form it, that's supper creepy
He probably answered it and I'm dumb but what headphones does he have?
How the hell did people even find out where he lived through the inside of his house/apartment?
Do you oil your beard
There I lay wondering.... is his hair going grey?
What about your green screen? Where‚Äôs that at in your room?
Does anyone know what monitors he uses? Thankyou
8:03 look at his hair
Lose the beard
Me ded guys he has sooooooo much stuft to record with omg
I feel like the broken light is a reminder for spacing during VR and thats why it doesn't get replaced.
Whats your screen recorder
What about the sound board?
Hey jack did u dye ur hair on the sides or r u just getting old?
Nice set up. If you made it stay green the eye emblem would look loosely like a septic eye
Damn that forehead
Remember the old days when u used to do the outro like ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs it for this episode and I‚Äôll see all u dudes in the next videoooo and high fives all round kapeesh kapeesh‚Äù
I'm kind of curious about his house, but at the same time, can't /belive/ people went to the other places he'd lived...that's just creepy; he needs and deserves privacy just like everyone else
Yeah it's insane... now I feel poor
His hair!?

Can you please please die your hair green again please please
Get a haircut
Can I play crisis
Quick question...Are we ever gonna get another drumming video again? Just been wondering...for a while...
Am I the only one who misses the drum covers
How much storage does your computer have
What's that on the window ledge at 11:24 to me it looks like a single server rack. And on top of it there is a casual monitor.
Speaking of drums, you have to make more drumming videos!!
Okay thats cool and all, But can it run Crysis?
I haven't visited this channel In a long time but he has VERY MUCH changed his appearance
I wonder if the green haired jacksepticeye would have ever imagined a room like that
his hair is like suuuuper white looking     lol light
Am I the only one who assumed Sean‚Äôs floor was carpet
Origin is honestly a really really bad company from my experience. About constant issues for years though I‚Äôm sure especially in these cases of sponsorships they make sure it works out for them.
Can it run crysis
mEmE
2016 Jackaboy 2019 jackaman
Are you old
felix should get a camera
Sean I still love you but I miss your old look. I liked it when you just had green hair and no ear hole things and beard.
With my cosplay content I just need a camera, cosplays and conputer to record unless i do a challenge video or a video at night I need the lights lol
What‚Äôs his wallpaper?
Cut ur beard
Is 64GB of RAM really necessary
With all the lighting right up on Sean's face, I couldn't really tell how much gray hair he had... But oof after watching this, Wow at 29, I don't know anyone who's had that much hair decolored
GodDamn you look old
Good choice on the 55mm prime. Amazing lens. Wouldn't have thought of it for content like yours but you definitely make it work very well! nice choice, always love to hear peeps that are into their camera gear!
What Desk?
Ah finally.
Man bun O.O
The Green Screen Must Be Hideing.....
Green screen?
Green screen?
Green screen?
How do you get the markers to fall
If you are in South Africa and saw the simble that was on the camera (simble is ZA)
So, is jack going bald?
Why do people ask about the quality of the camera that jack has? Don't they see it in like every video??
2:03
Sexy!

Poor poor Naive SEAN...

It's all about money

What about the laaaaaaamps?
Oh oh oh yo mum's basement
Have a good day person reading this comment!
Hey, Sean. Question if you have the time. I don't want this to seem like I'm prying in to the details of the rest of your house, but I was wondering where you keep all the stuff you had on your old shelf?
Jack can you do a cool vid  with your Mcwomans like idk vr or something lol.

I‚Äôm still not used to the mini ponytail on your head. It looks weird

I want the old jacl back when he has no beard and have green hair
Jack I wanna say that your set up is fantastic! Whenever I do let‚Äôs plays, they last about 10 minutes at most and I only use my phone and my PlayStation 4 recording (no camera). I take about 15 minutes to put my video together, never edit anything, and wait 30 for it to upload. I wish I had your set up
Favoriting for reference to when I eventually try my hand at this kinda thing.
Dear god i wish i had that baby for my pc
How much would you say that costs?

I don‚Äôt like the beard, I really dont

Was that a fake background or a real background?
Need more broken lamps hmmm.
Can I get this stuff in aus
jake u need to shave
Great office setup and awesome content and glad you don‚Äôt tell people where u live. Because parents who think that there kids have entitlement to meet the youtubers are in the wrong
Monitors?
Jack said it if you got a potato start with a potato and work your way up to a steak! Haha. Encourage the small channels to grow! In a small channel of 42 subs and this video really inspired me more to continue
Why does this video enlarge your forehead XD
We need to know the storage of ur PC

I got jealous when i saw ur pc .. becuz my pc is 9 years old .. and im in desperate need for a new one .. because rn i cant record because my computer is shitty .. but yeah i just need like $500 or $750 for my new pc .. but yeah .. :(
Hey jack try playing surviving mars: green planet

LET YOUR HAIR DOWN YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD. LET YOUR HAIR DOWN! LET YOUR HAIR DOWN!
My setup xb1 PS4.  4 controllers for some reason and the shitty ps4 headset
All of you have been fooled. The background is FAKE!
Also i find this funny but jack is basically saying "I have fancy things" while we are watching this on inferior devices
What about the monitors?
hai jack :) i have a really needed question about the goXLR. i¬¥ve read in the internet that the monitoring of this is terrible. what would you say ? the monitoring is a high priority for me and i would not spend so much for it when is so bad. i hope you can help me, greetings from Germany <3
Grey hair
Speed is key
please get rid of the ponytail
You could use a plastic white plumbing pipe for your plugs. It will look a lot tidy. You can spray paint them to if you don't like the colour but make sure you sand it down before painting üòä
Whats the story behind the duck tape on the chair??
Pewds should use your camera
Go back to skate
Please bring your camera when you go to Pewds place

I remember your cabin days. You my friend have come far and you seem like you stayed humble. Congrats my man!
I'm sitting here drooling over this setup, like holy cow!






who says holy cow anymore?
Sean, thanks for the great advice at the end about equipments and stuff. Because when the video started I felt so poor in my life that I can't afford any of that. But just like you said simple equipments can be worthy for a great cause and I highly accept that. Thanks again ya Legend :,))
JACK! Double sided tape is your friend! Stick the power strip to the back of the desk crossbar!
OMG!!!! His beard shines and so does my heart üòçüòçüòçüòçüòÜüò≠

I love how you're not one of those showey-offy yootoobrrs who just dispose all thier riches in your face
Jack has a hole in his ear
Where is the green screen jack, show us
What type of keyboard do you have?
I would have thought you would have three monitors

Okey jack still didn't remove the tape in his chair I like the style tho but I like the green showing wait is it green?? Idk. But I hope Jack will remove the tape

So cool! Feels like a field trip in a YouTuber's office. greatest part is that this is free.
What about your green screen
For some reason I really wanted to see how the green screen worked
What headphones do you use?
That beard is sprinkled with glitters.
WHAT ABOUT THE GREEN SCREEN ??
W H E R E S T H E G R E E N S C R E E N?!

Y does his hair look grey
Hey Jack try using final cut pro for editing it's a one time purchase and easier to use I was in a film class and edited with both and final cut was super easy
Shave ur beard challenge
l like your vidios jack!!!
I really don't understand why people would invade someone's private life just to see them for like 1 min. I mean yeah you really wanna see the person but that doesn't mean you can just show up at their house!
Just a warning, the camera costs about $2,000. It looks good, but don't use it just for let's play's, take it out, and snap some pics with it.
Jack please play the game snakey bus. It's super fun game. Hope you make video on that soon
One of many reasons why I love this channel:
the best and most hilarious unboxing I‚Äôve ever seen
You and wiishu live together
Not a question about equipment, but what editing software do you/Robin use for your videos?
That beard shine tho üëåüèº
my setup costed ¬£22,000
Jack can you please do a subnautica video please please please I won't stop
Jack: Setup Tour
Felix: Look at my Webcam Shows Potato
Is the the new kratos?
the lighting keeps making me think the Gaelic gladiator is getting grays hairs.
The best setup ever
Where do you keep your green screen??
I love your setup Sean the camera you use I actually have but the rest of the shit nope
You do need a lot of good hardware to even stream a game most people are stuck with a i5 76k or lower and a gtx  1060 3gb graphics card or lower you can‚Äôt stream on that hardware only video streams would  work good
I wish I have a computer set where I could do Yt and Fortnightüòñ
Can you play a plague tale ?
It must be hot as hell in that little room with all those lights around him... lol
Jack, your beard looks so black yet you head looks so gray. What's going on with your lighting?
Hey Sean or Jack .. what the name of your Desk the one in the video you showed that goes to the height you set. 
Thank you and keep up the good work
is that a real white hair ?
You should do a yearly gear update

JACK?! Where‚Äôs the green screen???
Yo but can you play Crysis with Ultra settings on  100 FPS?!
*Looks at notification " Jacksepticeye's Office Setup Tour"
Nobody:
Me: Well , it was his time to flex.
Standing Is Best when Your Playing Horror Games.
Someone's getting jealous of that quality
I like 2013 setup it is awesome
I miss that jack :(
Such High Quality video.
I like how you still haven't replaced the lamp you broke back from beatsaber :p
0:53 small glimpse of his house
In what world do people think it‚Äôs okay to show up to someone‚Äôs house like that...
A) It‚Äôs creepy that anyone found his house in the first place
B) WHY. WHY WOULD YOU SHOW UP
This video actually made me laugh towards the end!
I miss the green hair...üò¢üò¢üò£
What about the sound reduction walls?
I dont wanna watch this because ima computer nerd and i dont have a gud pc but jack does and ill get healous lol
Forget everything else, I need to know where you got that dope viking axe bracelet. 9:47
Hey jacksepticeye ur beard is almost as big as my dads, but with a whole lot of less grey hair
How old is Jack ?
Also, you brought up how the background was plain for the camera that you used, so I had an idea while re-watching this. It has been a while since we saw it, but have you thought of bringing back the bookcase of fan-made/other special items you have received. Of course, maybe have two so there isn't just a random bookcase by itself and one that goes with the flow of the room. Not sure if this would mess any of your VR systems up, but thought it would be cool to see a return of something that you always loved to look at and be able to showcase some of the items that you cared for.
But how do you do it with your console when playing/recording exclusives?
Say, why not just getting an equivalent power supply (the brick that's part of the plug) for your wall power instead of using a transformer? I do agree with it being a nice to have, but if it's just for that one thing it seems pointless to me
Im so jealous, i wish i have a desktop like this. ;(
SEAN BUY A NEW BACKGROUND LAMP ALREADY ITS BEEN A MONTH!!!
REAL BACKROUND!
People go to Jack's house, meanwhile when I run into someone who is in the public eye/famous I stumble back five steps whilst apologizing for infringing upon their private space. xD 

I know Jack has said he's cool with people coming up to him. I'm just poking fun at how vastly different people are.
you didn't show your green screen!
Sean, 5 minutes ago i thought i had a nice gaming computer (which i do.) But now after comparing it to yours i feel like its garbage.

Edit: after looking at his
 specs, he said he as a couple hard drives. Are those hard drives regular hdds and not ssds cuz i would be surprised if they werent.
An artist played pasporout 2.
Is it just me or is his beard twinkling?
Jack..... You forgot to show the green screen.... If that ever existed
Do all Irish people yell and have a great sense of humor?
Can you show your mic
HE HAS NO LEGS!CONFIRMED!
Where is satisfactory
Jack what happened to the shelf you had in your old apartment full of fan stuff, did you keep it, do you have all the stuff people have given you over the years?
Real background = Like the video
Fake background = Like the video
Pick your choices now folks!
How much does all that sound deadening material cost
I only wanted to look at your window.
GREEN SCREEN
Do you sit like a true gamer (etc. with your legs on the chair)
Okay, Robin wins, sorry Brad, he wins.
jack playing satisfactory with his graphics card on his beast of a computer: üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
me playing with my crap computer thats old and has baaad afterburn on the monitor: tries to look to the left and it takes 10 minutes to load ahhhh welp, eventually the money i put into this game will pay out in entertainment üòÇ
That was a nice close-up Jack
Jack's beard looks so glittery in this vid. He said he hates it and now he puts some in his beard
0:29 yeah keep that private (in a good way)
Any body else notice his hair looked gray because of the light
He jacked up. I bet you shower with Irish Spring
Man. Your beard‚Äôs thick.
I love the office show!
Your desk scares me
Slime  ranthir
I spent a lot of time during this video trying to figure out if your hair had changed color, as well as staring at your beard.
There, I got that out of the way and I can say what I think of the video's content.
I really ought to, once I have a place of my own, get a desk like that.  My mom says I sit down too much and need a setup where I can stand while at my computer sometimes.  (Honestly, I'm happy with my low-budget setup right now, and the desk is, at the moment, the only thing I'd even remotely want to change.  Maybe when/if I start playing games for my channel or making different videos I'll find other things I'd want to change, but right now I'm happy, and that's all that matters.)
play TABS
Where‚Äôs the drums do more drums
Out of every youtuber that showed their high-end setup sean on the other hand convince new youtuber that is not necessary to get all the high end stuff just to start youtube career this is why i like him
Why do people bug youtubers when they find out where they live leave them be .
If I know where a youtuber lives I would go to their house to bug them I'd rather wait till a big event happens to meet them  .
Has anyone noticed how septic eye Sam has basically vanished from the channel after he got rid of his green hair? COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT!!
Green screen
Everyone who is curious about rest of Jack's house his living room is shown in  The episode where he talks to Bryan Decart ( Detroit become Human )
how much the camera cost ???
I wanna say link the chair, but you probably don't do that
-911 what‚Äôs your emergency?
-kid,telekinetic powers
-location?
-weed farm
Jack:keeps making romantic choices

Finn:imma bout to end this whole mans career
Mutes copyrighted music but leaves the nude scenes. What a legend

Wow thanks for 300 likes
Am I the only one feeling genuinely bad for Sean's frikkin' eye?!
You keep forgetting that they know a family there in Puerto Lobos, so their life would be safer and better than any other option.
nobody:

life is strange: wHeN wIlL yOu LeArN tHaT yOuR aCtIoNs HaVe CoNsEqUeNcEs
jack u should learn to play the ukulele so you can play it whenever it there‚Äôs copyrighted music
Daniel's doin a BOY from God of BOY. 
He gets super cocky, does an oof, realizes his mistake, becomes Loki...
This is legit the first time I've seen Daniel harm Cassidy. And I've watched three other people play this game.
Underage drinking,working on an illegal pot farm,

Sean: LLLLLIIIIIIIITTTTTEEEEEEERRRRRRR
i can see a pattern. 


1) They get a place to stay.
2) danial gets friends.
3) one mistake.
4) on the road again!
Jack: has Sean go swimming in the lake after he just got a tattoo
Me: remembers what Penny said about the water 
Welp I sure hope Sean enjoys that infection
Let's take a while appreciating the game. The developers made a great job planning the characters, personality, script, the plot, and the drawing of the setting and atmosphere and coming up with colours and all. Her hair for example is just cool, and I feel it sure does represent her personality. Little things, but not randomly made.
37:49 Sean: somebody blew the lock ‚Ä¶* Me: somebody also blew sean.
I really hope smth happens and then Sean's superpowers get triggered so he can flex on Daniel
Replace copyright music with All The Way
Calling it now, at some point in the game there will be a choice for Sean to make Daniel look at the flowers
*whenever Cassidy asks Sean to do stuff with her*
Jack: *presses yes every time*
Damn jack sure can talk for those last 14 mins
Cassidy: they're armed
Jack: uhh we're all  armed (raises arms)
Life is Strange 2: "I'm glad you and Daniel have each other"
The Walking Dead S1: "I'm glad you and Clementine have each other" 
Me: Uh oh, oh god please no.
I have a theory! Daniel has got the super power from his mother. Karen also had superpowers but she couldnt live with it and that is why she left.
And maybe Sean has superpowers as well but he hasn't discovered them yet.
29:12
"Other people's dreams are not your responsibility" -Jacksepticeye Best quote 2019, keep inspiring people around the world Sean
The romantic scene with Sean And Cassidy
And Jack Singing makes it more BetterüòÇüòÇ
You want to borrow my 130 lbs dog Sean? He's a giant love muffin!
15:29
Jack: are they even at age to drink?

10 Minutes Ago: sees little kid work at pot farm and sees little kid almost get roughed up by guard
Love jack, and all,  but I disagreed with about 75% of the decisions in this episode, lol
Jack: Makes bad choices
Game: Gives him bad consequences
Jack:  :0
I like your (Jacksepticeye) idea of the story. Dedicating the first episode to character building and the rest focus more on both his powers and finding Mom seems alright.

Also, I agree with you in which building a better relationship with Daniel would have better than with Cassidy. But, as we all know, this game has smoke and mirrors and we'd wound up at the end of a gun any way we choose. Finn... what a Jake. 

Heh... Adventure Time.
At least Max was old enough to be aware of what she was doing and tried to make the right decisions. Daniel is literally a brat who does whatever he wants without a care in the world for how it will affect other people. I thought he'd improve my episode 3, but that just isn't the case, and now I'm wondering if this is supposed to be the climax of the game or just even more buildup in which case they'd have to rush episode 4 or 5 if it's the latter.
No one:
Not a single soul:
No one in this universe: 





Me waiting for the plot twist where Sean has powers: üòµ
TL;DR of Jack's summary:
Life is Strange >> Life is Strange 2
Joe: GET IN HERE YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE
Sean: my Daniel senses are tingling
1:10 
Jack:  goes to settings to turn off copyrighted music
Jack: Hums copyrighted music
Damn that ending.....He just turned into








SeanSepticEye
15:30 
Jack: are any of you a legal drinking age?
*they all work on a weed farm*
*Sean and Daniel as adults at a bar

Sean: "Hey remember that time you blinded me? Yeah, this round's on you."
So the lesson learnt today kid with super powers hangs out with weed hippies end up becoming a super powered thief GJ Daniel
Daniel said he want to spend time with Sean
but Jack say no 
poor Daniel
Such a neat and comfy episode - plus Jacks commentary...something awesome! <3
Yeah because Daniel didn't want to wake you up
God, Daniel is a major brat. I can‚Äôt
"The child asked me to put him in danger." Great fckin excuse man. Jees can't believe I used to like Finn
cassidy: they're armed!
jack: *holds up arms* we're all armed...
me: stop it dad ur embarrassing me
Hey if you hate daniel they did good job at it
Jack:are they legal drinking age
Me: Jack they live in the woods i don't think they need it
Let me tell you about this...

Daniel improvement in episode 1:
Became brat (with powers)
Daniel improvement in episode 2:
Became a stuborn
Daniel improvement in episode 3:
Became (almost) a killer
This is like the walking dead.but with no zombie.
Daniel and finn are progressively becoming my least favorite characters
Hey Jack, they always knew that their mum was alive. They just thought that she abandoned them.
Sean and Cassidy swimming 
jack on the other side of the lake . CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT
Having the music on would seriously make this game so much more emotional.
(dont read this if you havent seen this episode)








Well...Sean is one step closer to becoming a pirate...i guess.
Merrills gun: pointy pointy


Daniels power: im about to end this mans whole career
Jesus. The disconnect between me and Jack is just. Ridiculous in this game.
Jack: Yeeeeeeah!
Me: Noooooo!
Jack I think you got mixed up. The moms character was always alive. She just left the dad, Daniel, and Sean without saying anything. They always knew she was alive she just ran out on them when they were young. Thats why Sean wants nothing to do with her.
The next episode: August 22nd

Jack:31 of August, BIATCH!
Spoilers!!!!





Sean has a SEPTIC EYE now * da da tish*
Me: Watching video while eating peanuts

Also me 5 minutes later: Crunching intensifies
Cassidy: wow you really are cold 
Me: IT'S NOT MY FINAL FORM
16:00 dude you would have found out about Finn's family thing if you asked him about his story, you didn't do that so that's why the jail thing makes no sense to you.
19:58 and he packed up and left everyone because there was no one to actually leave. He had no one, so why should he have stayed.
Daniel:Can levitate stuff and move it around But can't stop a bullet
Daniel: gets shot and starts telepathicly messing with all the shit
Jack: ‚ÄúUhhh... I think I made a super villain!‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ Dead 51:15
Anyone else disappointed that Jack didn't have Sean pursue a romantic relationship with Finn? 
(Also, did Jack KNOW that Finn was totally flirting with Sean or even knew the romantic relationship route with Finn was possible
???????)
Jack you are amazing and inspire and help me every day this series is one of my favorites
15:00 Jack: "If you have a steady job"
Says he as they literally just got fired and I don't even know if they got their money...
Sean: I did it, my bad 
Big joe sucker punches Sean 
Clip of Madagascar k.o scene
Omg i just realised finn looks like wade from gtav
didn't they mention this lake is toxic or sth
but yolo I guess
The fact that Jack and I have the same CUNT mug makes me happy on a spiritual level
it would be cool if Sean Gets A Power Like Regen Or Something
"Are any of you even at the legal drinking age"

Jack they're working at an illegal pot farm

And are on the run because they killed a cop
Jesus Christ you choose all the things that I wouldn't choose!! So frustrating, but i kinda love itüëåüëå
when Cassidy started to undress, my brain was...









And i realize, Sean did not use it i was like...
Today's fact: Iguanas have three eyes. Two normal eyes and a third eye on top of their head that only perceives brightness.
Who's happy Sean in game and Cassidy finally got together
THE WOLF TATOO PFFFFT SKKSKSKSK LMAOOOO. It's sweet tho
If i was Danielle i would be an introvert of all the introverts... I mean i know 73% of y'all gonna do the same...right?
Was anyone else super uncomfortable during the skinny dipping secne
Sometimes I feel like jack is the voice actor of mater from cars
Why does Big Joe looks like Michael from GTA 5 ? ü§îü§îü§î
Sean's definitely half blind look at the way hes walking in the end scene
Everytime there's supposed to be music playing jack should just sing.
yo call up obito, he'll hook him up with a sharingan
"but my winky shrivels up in the cold water!" jacksepticeye 17-05-2019 there a quote for ya X'D
I KNEW you were the type of person to like Gorillaz!! (favorite album?)
When jack says it‚Äôs gonna be months before next episode
Me; fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
Jack in TWD: thinks ahead


Jack now: My actions don't have consequences
Dear Daniel,
when will you learn... whEN WILL YOU LEARN, THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES?
Imagine if when jack made his own music for the beginning he got copy striked
"i don't wana get in any more trouble"
bro you killed some copes. i don't think it matters if you bust a meth farm.
33:42 
Jacks face looks so uncomfortableüòÇ
Cassidy: The best way to remember someone is...
Me: A kiss!
Jack: Sleeping together~
Cassidy: a tattoo..
More life Is strange to please 


(Ps love you vids)
I can't take it, there's SO.MUCH.AKWARDNESSüòì
I just felt such a rush of RELIEF when you decided against Finns‚Äô plan üòÖ
YouTube:
S√©an: posts nudity on YouTube again and doesn't get demonetized
It's like Atreus all over again,  but if the kid doesnt fix his attitude, 

im adopting Sean as my lil bro. üíÅüíÅ

Edit : wtf Daniel???  omggg his eyeüò≠üò≠üò≠
Daniel: "I'm not a little kid anymore!!!"
Also Daniel: *hasn't even hit puberty*
Nooo!!! I'm heartbroken by Jack's decision with Finn. 

Well is his playthrough. He can do what he wants.
Daniel needs to let Sean be himself-


CHILLBROCHILLLLLL
Sean: Want's Daniel to control his powers

End of Episode Daniel: I'm bout to end this mans whole career.
Man-I have a gun .. down to your knees 
Daniel-My man its 2019
Aaaanddd now In game Sean has every std in existence
Sean and Daniel already knew their mother was alive before seeing the letter. Sean literally stated about 5 times a few even directly that their mother just left them, she wasn't dead.
Game: does sean like boys or girls 
Me: yes
I also have a superpower 

My superpower is making chocolate disappear
ahahahah When Jack said "its Aries season" I couldn't get the picture of Julien flossing with knives out of my head
30:10
"Are you resisting the urge to kiss me right now?"
"Not really. I'm really into this cheesecake, though."
I'm easy to please. I see Cassidy, I click! I see Life is strange 2 I click! I see Jack I click!
Just kill joe with the screwdriver 
The screwdriver strikes again
-jack
has flashbacks and laugh
26:27 IS THE FUNNIEST THING YOU COULD EVR HEAR FROM SEAN
When you are in the same room with your parents and a sex scene comes on...... Lord i bust out laughing due to an award scilence. Way to go Sean!

Also did anyone else get a frickin trogan comerical in this? XD
I wonder if Daniel ran off to his mother...?
"We didn't come together" 
I love you Sean
Daniel: Have a power

Also Daniel: Never use his power
dude jack always somehow ends up with the best ending like
anyone realize Finn looks like Floyd from GTA5
Is this the origin of Anti (AntiSepticEye)?
The way Jack realizes that Finn may be dragging Daniel to the heist in the middle of the lake scene lol.
How did he not see that coming much earlier
Why did you have to sing that song The Scream note killed me I can't stop laughing
I feel like the storylines seem rushed and the dialogs don't make since all the time even in context.  I agree with what you said.
It's confirmed. 
Sean's a bottom!
I'm hoping, the next episode involves Danial growing up. He will have to deal with all this new trauma, and the consequences. Hopefully he steps up, and comes into his own. Instead of just being a brat.

EDIT: After seeing the teaser, My guess is Sean gets up alone. Either everyone is dead, or gone. Then he sets off on his own. Clueless and heartbroken. Eventually, Danial will show up to save him, when the cops have him backed into a corner.
Hey can you please play Reassembly or Swarm Universe? Also the heavy is a spy
Cassidy"wanna come in"
Jack "rip monetization"
Sean, you should just make your own game someday honestly. A story game I hope, i think it‚Äôd be pretty good
You sure Sean ain‚Äôt gay bc it looked like he had enough room for that pipe. ü§£
Talking about lotto and stuff, couldn‚Äôt Daniel just rig the powerball or something?
that's what i think is going to happen:
sean and daniel are going to run away and searching for a place to go,because porta lubroes is dangerous for them because the police can find them they will go to theyre mom and she will have powers aswell
I hereby thank myself for 1 like
Shout out to me
I DUNNO WUTS HAPPENING ON TV MOM IM 12. IM SCREECHING
"You, your friends
& your dog
are dead!"

(Reference to that 2D puzzle horror game - can't remember what it's called)
34:48 
Jack: does anybody have a dog, i want to take it just for one week!
Me: as a wise man ones said ŒúŒüŒõŒüŒù ŒõŒëŒíŒï
Sean: ‚ÄúWe have other things we gotta to do.‚Äù
Jack: ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúLike Cassidy...‚Äù
That moment when you realize Jacksepticeye sounds like a better writer than the writers of life is strange...
Shaun definitely gets it right at 33:50 that's me in a nutshell lol
I like Cassidy more then lily-
Daniel is really starting to remind me of Atreus from God of War.
plot twist: Donald Trump is in this game and the wall happens






which is a really bad thing
Hey! Just clarifying for you, Sean, that they never thought their Mom was dead! In-game Sean hates her because she walked out on the family and left them, and she never tried to contact them or anything after.
MORE LIFE IS STRANGE!!!!!!!!!!!
Goes skinny dipping and bang 
Jack: ONE HANDED GAMING
Jack: A light little wapoosh~
Me: Okay Sean what happend what is wrong?! Are you okay?! Are you fine?!
didn't she said she couldn't draw ? @_@
Why isn't ANYONE choosing Finn's path?! 
I'm so sad :(
I completely agree with Sean's assessment of this game and how it could have been so much better (more time with the father and less with the grandparents and just more of a defined plan).  Unfortunately it is what it is...kinda like GoT season 8...
Jack: I think I made a super villain 
Me: gasps are we gonna get Daniel v Max?!
When does anyone get sleep?! It's Jake from State Farm!Top of the morning to you jack-a-boi! X3

When the music stopped, I started sing Let's get it on, and Jack also started it, a laughed so hard ü§£ü§£ü§£
8:27 not watched any further stopped to comment this


Big. Joe. Is. F***ED


Oh.
SEAN  (the game character)NOW IS PARK OF THE JACKSEPTICEYE TEAM AS HE NOW HAS A SEPTIC EYE....also owie!
I feel bad that Lyla hasn‚Äôt talked to Sean in this episode! üòû
Now this would be the right time to say Damn Daniel
yeah clearly whoever wrote this part knows 0 about weed
33:55 
I would be like SEND HALP
keep going with this jack üëåüèº really good bit of fun to watch while relaxing
Yep Jacksepticeye is ready for another gameplay.

Showing us he can finish this game.
Good content my guy nice laughs along the wayüíØü§ùüòÅü§£
"I'm great at weed" - Jacksepticeye 2019
SUPERVILLIAN!! WE GOT A SUPERVILLIAN!!
Want pizza üçïüçïüçï with a cute hedgehog delivering it
Sean you should listen to the song that plays at the end of this! Its called Natalie by Milk and Bone. Its such a good song and fits so well with the ending!
You better tell Daniel that he might be an uncle And you better tell him
Sean needs his own powers
Feel like this is a spin of to dark phoinex lol
god i didn't realize how freaking awkward these games are without music
Wow, I'm starting to get early...


W-WHAT DO I SAY?!
Jack: Is ok with people harvesting pot. Also jack: gets triggered at littering.
i agree with everything you said about LIS
"That's a lotta blood."
Boi, there are people dead here, a nosebleed is more blood than is on the screen.
33:27
Jack making the best part of the video.
Wow I was on edge through this all. But yeah, I guess I can live with these results, I also wanted to see some sort of major conflict like this.
Guys, hear me out on this. What if daniel and sean have healing abilities, and to trigger them, you have to have had a serious injury. When dan got shot, he shrugged it off like it was nothing. So maybe sean's eye will heal!
Jack: Daniel doesn't have a good role model
also, Jack: *Gets naked with Cassidy while knowing that Daniel and Finn disappeared
God dang man you gota do what is best for Dan man! You dont got yo timy windy power no more
OMFG I'm so lucky he did a quiet intro cuts I had my headphones on max XD
I wished it was Sean with the powers so the game would be more fun
8:56 I laughed so hard when jack said that XD XD XD XD
I just realized Jack's Sam eye is just staring through my soul.
Are they set up daniel to be super villain
Dude, jack i watched all the endings and  you got the best possible one trust me
JACK before you upload your video go back and add royalty free music PROBLEM SOLVED
This episode has gone uhm...
Very kinky.
29:13 ‚Äúother peoples dreams are not your responsibility‚Äù hits me hard every time
I don't usually watch your analysis of the games at the end but I agree with you 100% on this one.
People: Sean Sean Sean 
Me: YES!!!!!!
Jack: Me Me Me Me
Momma bear Cassidy for the win.
That girl was so flat that youtube algorithm approved her as a Lad





    Madd !
"screw the hookers, bring on the choc-o-crisp"
Holy crap
That's all I have to say.
After looking, in my opinion you got one of the best endings for this episode, good job!
Jack remember that campfire from part 2 life is strange 2 ep 3 someone said that you can‚Äôt change the past what if max caulfield will,come
You sounded like Tow Mater, from Cars when you did that accent.
Jack forgot to censor the... Things on Cass 33:41
25:12
Looks more like a shaved sheep with a wolf head and a fox tail than an actual wolf lol
Daniels becoming a narcissist at that age....
BECAUSE YOUR VIDEO'S ARE THE BEST AND BECAUSE LIFE IS STRANGE 2 IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
Alright, this comment ended up being way longer than I originally intended lmao. Read if you're interested in some fun facts and my thoughts on varous parts of this episode and LiS in general I guess haha. I even broke stuff up more to make it easier to read. 

To clarify, I don't think Finn and Cassidy are siblings. I think Finn just calls some people "sis" as a character quirk. 

Also, yes, they know their mother is alive (and they always did, imo, but I'll get back to that later) but Sean appears to have severe issues with her that makes him never want to talk to her ever again. Maybe it's just because I can relate to Sean in that aspect, but I understand to some degree why they're not seeking help from their mother more. Puertos Lobos was already THE PLAN and Sean wants to follow through with that and live somewhere their dad was familiar with. It does make sense if you stop to think about it. Yeah, I hope we find out in more detail what their mother did, and I think that comes naturally hand in hand with the boys meeting her again somehow, but I understand why it hasn't happened yet.

Oh and btw Sean, Finn explains why he was in jail if you ask him about his story earlier in the game. It wasn't actually his fault, at least not entirely, it was his dad's. Finn "packed up and left" after that happened, because his family was so chaotic. He had no need to tell anyone, he was better off without them.

And Sean is still 16 I believe, so yeah, the potential sexy scene is a biiiiiit awkward lol

There was a way to silently get into the car, it's a little tricky though. Oh, and if you go with the heist Cassidy isn't even there so avoids getting hurt from what happens to that house in the end. So it's not such a black and white choice, imo. It's actually so bizarre to me that Daniel attacked Cassidy in your game because that didn't happen to me, he just does the "I can do... WHAT I WANT" and opens the door with his power.

I think the problem Daniel had with this group is that they're so much older than him. Just remember how excited he got when they were with the grandparents and he found out Chris was around his age. It was the same with me when I was Daniel's age too. I wanted to hang out with kids around my age, not teens way older than me. I think it was different with Finn because he's so chill and had already met him briefly at the Christmas market. With Cassidy, especially since she's so into Sean, I could see Daniel getting more jealous and not liking her as much (which is how it is even if he doesn't attack her)

D.A.N.C.E. by Justice played during the part where Sean wakes up late and everyone was cheering "SEAN! SEAN! SEAN!" as he runs up

This is just my theory, but I still think Rachel had a power and died not knowing it. That wildfire spread WAY too fast and only died out once something happened to Rachel... still seems like way too much of a coincidence to me.

I wouldn't dismiss the importance of episode 2 so early tbh. Remember, we also met Chris and what happened to him at the end of episode 2 is bound to be important at some point, as well as how the dad handles it and everything.


I was always pretty certain the boys didn't think their mother was dead all this time. Their dad didn't lie about anything. Their mother did something horrible and THAT is the issue here, not some shock where she's alive. Sean knew she was alive, he just didn't care because, again, he has mother issues.

Also, of course Daniel's going to lash out if he got shot in the shoulder. That has nothing to do with any choice you made, it can happen either way.
OMG HE KNOWS WHO GORILLAZ ARE MY HEART JUST JUMPED OUT OF MY CHEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#15 on trending. Yup üòé
Jack what's wrong? Your intro wasnt loud.
You should wear a squad life is strange 2 cosplay hoodie for the next episode
Damn jack. You really messed it up haha
Sean just you know the ending you got was one of the best possible ones
8:55 üòÇ nice Friday reference
Penny is secretly the Flash, he's just phasing
DAN THERE WAS A LITERALLY DOG
PET IT FOR DAYS
Whoever got the hitman reference, you're a real OG!
15:50 Finn is secretly BillyGoat from the Escapists
Bruh, jack needs to his own choice biased game!
I HAVE THAT SAME ‚ÄúBLACK HANDLE UNT MUG‚Äù!!!
I‚Äôll be very mad if Cassidy is dead she‚Äôs the only character other then Sean and Daniel I care about
Edit: never she was just Injured
Sean: *completely ignore Daniel even tho he said he want to be with his older brother more
Daniel: *get mad
Sean: Why are you mad??

Also i feel like this game is pretty clever when it makes you choose between the ‚Äúready to grow up Sean‚Äù and the take care of responsibility (Daniel) and the ‚Äúteenage kid Sean‚Äù who just want to do what he want, having the choise to develope character like that is really cool

BUT i‚Äôm really bond with Daniel so FUCK THE 2nd OPTION IM GONNA TAKE CARE OF MY BOY DANIEL
oh boy Sean is getting a septic eye.
Now where have I heard that before...?
Jack: "Are anyone of you legal American drinking age"

Me: Jack they are working on a illegal pot farm I seriously doubt they care about the legal drinking age lol
Yeah Jack. you got the best ending.
Atleast he swiped his V card
jack screamed "young love" at two children skinny dipping and kissing
daniel is a little shit. poor sean...
but jack your decisions weren't the best - however idk how much the storyline really changes based on your choices
SE√ÅN HAS A SEPTICEYE
Great vid, love to watch you play story games
ON YOUR KNEES. WE SO DIRTY MINDED DGJJJKLO
The beautiful song indeed make  the ending a lot better.
Jack: I think I made a super villain

One minute later...

Jack: Alright body check who‚Äôs dead and who‚Äôs alive?
Any one elce hiding in the comments at  33:37 üòÇüòÇ
i haven't watched him in years. HOLY CRAP HAS HE CHANGED
You can borrow my dog but if you steal her I will steal the head from you shoulders... actually no I won‚Äôt coz your awesome but you would be sent to jail



(This is not a real threat it‚Äôs for the jokes)
Hey keep doing these videos there really good
Jacob has depression 100%
20:38

Oof the cup lmao
YouTube is drunk again 313 views 383 likes
I'm not a very critical person in general but I'm quite enjoying this series, I get why Daniel is acting the way he does, he feels neglected and doesn't want to show it and because of this he is training by himself and isn't being taught things properly by Sean because he is a kid too and sometimes neglects his duties as a brother.  I'm interested to see how next episode pans out and what's going to happen between Sean and Daniel. I feel I'm one of the people that likes how the game has and is panning out üòÖ
I think it‚Äôs really interesting to be playing the bystander to the superhero (or super villain with how this game is going)
I really feel like Sean is going to end up have at lease some kind of power. Especially after that last scene. Unless they just kill off the main character, but I don‚Äôt think that would be very likely.
Square Enix: adds option to mute copyrighted music
Also Square Enix: doesn't censor boobs for youtube
‚ÄúMan you really are cold‚Äù HAHA
Hope everyone's having a good day, i'm early pretend I put a joke in here
20:35 We in sweden do speak like this if we come from Sk√•ne. I did not come frome sk√•ne but from Sm√•land so my accent is like a amerikan accent (for some reason)
I dunno, I think Daniel is justified considering all the trauma he went through so he's very dependant on Sean
Loved this episode dude!
I can just imagine at 33:28
Jack is just outside singing
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get it on‚Äù
Jack: Are any of you legal drinking age

Me: aren't they working on a weed farm
If they spent the whole first episode on the dad then Sean would just complain that they wasted so much time on a character that was going to die anyway. God, I get tired of him complaining constantly, especially about the voice acting, which is great.
Where we‚Äôre Finn and Cassidy is season 1 or was it before the storm?
When you were talking to Cassidy and that girl left her arm glitched.
Jack, an Irishman who won't say no to a drink: "Are you two of legal American drinking age?"
Me: "Sir, have you been drinking? Your acting like a pot and calling the kettle black, again."
I think they are swedish of how they prononce the city Malm√∂ 



I should know
i think the new characters show the passage of time and how far they've travelled
31:37
Sean: you ...want me to...come inside?

Me: Huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue.
Daniel probably left on his own
Congrats Jack, you got the best ending possible...
Oh wait nevermind, Sean got killed
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance to the Force?
They interviewed the kid
Oh, training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear

Does Star wars not exist in that universe cause this reminds me alot of Anakin so much
Daniel basically has the force
23:00
Jack Bullet Club confirmed
Why didn‚Äôt you go for the safe aghhhhhh (I haven‚Äôt watched this all yet) 



Edit: well shit...
Cassidy looks like lil miquela.
please make your own covers of songs to play in the background of the muted scenes
‚Äú I think I made a super villain‚Äù
He was already a super villain, did you see what he did to Cassidy and the tree in the lake?
Once again Jack is going to get demonized.
yep, kinda sweet to show sum nude to like 1 mill people 34:03
As long as Cassidy is alive, Sean has hope
Me: is that Weed?
A little bit later: IT IS WEED!!
The credits are always for welcome back to jacks story telling tips.
That escalated quickly, can't wait to see what happens next, Daniel is gonna go super sayan lol
Jacob is so awkward i am too so i like him lol that whole sentence seemed so uncomplex üòÇüòÇ
the gaelic gladiator knows da accents
Every boy feels there you know what in that cold lake scene
WHY DID THEY LEAVE US ON A CLIFFHANGER DON'T PULL A TWDG ON US
I so ship Sean and Finn.
Daniel's the new Super Villain Mate.
54:20 Oh man that eye took an absoulute pounding this episode
I'm not a fan about how they're changing him into a villain
In the credits someone's name was Constance gay
I played Party Tattoos by Dodie during the cutscenes. It works way too well.
Sean is just Carl from the waking dead now
Episode 4
 is coming out 22 August 2019 and Episode 5 is coming out on the 3rd December 2019
Jack do more funniest home videos
Also do the sham wow commersial its good cause vince is in it
after you should do all the good stuff with daniel
I feel like at the end, Sean is going to have to end Daniel's life to protect the world.
The description kills me
I feel like Jake thinks he's a sign if Jesus JAKE STOP WE DON'T NEED A CULT.
Sean you would love my dog Max. He's an snoutzer poodle mix and I could just watch his adorable tail wag all day.
wasn't the river toxic? thats what they said before.
bro when is the next vid
Wish I could make a video game great as this. Ah...
Sean likes those long plays man
We are dedicated fans.
We are always on the watch for new content.
We are SepticSubs.
I wonder what would be the conflict Jack said,
I wanna see more Daniel powers Jack said üò§
Daniel is my favourite character lol alot of people hate him
This is the best video Jack and I hope the new one comes soon can't wait
His face seeing that tattoo killed me
Tati gained 2mil + In a day 

Can i reach 100 in a day?
calmest intro he has ever done
YOUR VIDS ARE THE BOMB
I hope Daniel gets more mature as time goes on, he really annoyed me in this episode and the previous two. I knew they were setting up for Cassidy and Sean to get together. That sex scene made me uncomfortable as well. I would have let Finn get shot. I'm sorry but if someone screwed me over like that I wouldn't want anything to do with them and wouldn't care what happened to them. I agree with you that they should have built up the bond between the dad, Sean, and Daniel more in episode 1. Maybe we'll get a flashback of them bonding in the next episode. It looks like Sean will be alone, maybe he will reflect on the good times they had together?
I got so freaking happy when Sean and Cassidy got together. I knew it was going to happen but still
Cassidy inviting Sean to the tent: 

Me: MAKE BEAUTIFUL BABIES
29:25 when she said "I plead guilty", at first I thought she said "I peed again"
I like how the percentages at the end fucKING SPOIL WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
Every man respects sean when he went in the lake
They work on a weed farm. I don't think they care about the legal drinking age. Lol üòÇ
My problem with Life is Strange 2 is how useless the power is in the game and its boring plot. Literally the plot consists of Sean and Daniel's father dying so instead of seeing what happens if confronted by the cops, they are just running place to place with no value to them doing random activities that are meaningless and chatting, which is also meaningless. In the first Life is Strange, the story was more complex and interesting with time mechanics being intertwined with a tornado, meanwhile trying to discover what happened to Rachel with the player being thrown off track with a collective of shady and suspicious characters. Furthermore, Life is Strange gives the player a new time wielding mechanic that makes the game more interesting and unique, meanwhile also making the mechanic an essential part of the game to progress. This differentiates in comparison to Life is Strange 2 where not only is the power not given to the player, but the power has proven to be useless. It has not been utilized meaningfully with the plot and the fact that this is playing out so blandly ruins the game for me. Not to mention Life is Strange 2 has worse voice acting, worse expressions, and has a bland cast of characters. I couldn't care less about Sean and Daniel's relationship but in the first Life is Strange, the cast of characters are unique and intriguing and Max and Chloe's relationship is strong and makes the player feel attached to them. This is a bit of a rant, but yeah
oh man you need to look up that truck scene with the music!! its too good!
25:12 got me like OOF
Don‚Äôt turn your back on the wolfpac üê∫ü§ù
I feel like Daniel ran away because he saw the damage he had done
that's kinda sad. The developers said that this is the episode with the most choices yet the choices were so black and white that in the end there was no conflict and most people got the same ending. I feel like this episode could have been handled better especially with Finn's romance(?) route
56:50 hahaha constance (wheeze) constance gay hahahaha
Nice video and love the new mug
long story short Hi I am Kassidy with purple hair not to be confused with Cassidy with purple dreads 

So I‚Äôm one of those people who are doing something during videos and episode 3 videos threw me through a loop...
feels like people forget how kids act when they feel even a smidge powerful
No offense Shaun, but....






WHY ARE YOU CHOOSING THE WRONG THINGS AAAA
Nice haircut Jack üòé
Come inside? Uh I'm dead. XD
If this is anything like the walking dead then in episode 5 Sean Diaz might ‚Äúdie‚Äù protecting Daniel from the cops or big joe and Merrill then you‚Äôll be Daniel and using the power 100%





And Sean will either be shown alive at the end of cutscene or actually be dead
I really can‚Äôt defend this game anymore. This whole episode felt like filler and added nothing substantial to the story. They were trying to show us how Daniels powers effected how he acts, his personality, and how he grows as an individual but it was poorly executed. There‚Äôs no real call backs to past lIS2 episodes and the story as a whole feels choppy and disconnected from the past decisions you made. The point of life is strange is to have a say on what happens to the main characters, but it feels like every decision we made was pointless because every ending is basically the same. It‚Äôs infuriating bc as a fan I feel like they could of done a much better job with a title that has so much potential
I think Daniel got away with the money
And this video has been age restricted
I can not wait for the next episode ü§©ü§©ü§©ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
you will utilize Daniel's power if you choose the Finn route.
This Plan Is TERRIBLE




how is it terrible you are amazing jacksepticeye
I sense a Brody comeback in the future.
I hope Sean isn't dead cause Daniel would probably lose is sane and
Kill himself just to be with Sean
Very very sad...
To be continued...
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
AAH need another episode >.<
I have a lowkey crush on Ingrid lmao
No offense but he did pretty bad this ep I mean he ignored Daniel every chance he got
Yeah, I don't like Daniel at all, don't like him before as well.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Don't worry Jack you can have my dog as long as you take a photo with himü§£
I was screaming "no" since the skinny dipping part
Cass: let go swim in the lak

ME: She wants the D
the entire lake scene all I could hear were creepers being hit in the backround
idk why but i think sean and cassidy has the same face
FINNA DON'T MANIPULATE I'M TRYNA LOVE YOU
And that's why you still have the condoms safety first kids
Im actually crying...I binged all the ones you've done in a day, was dumb enough to get attached, and now trying not to cry. I legit hope episode 4 comes SOON. I wanna know if my boi, Sean, and his girl, Cassidy, are okay...
Why is everyone shouting sean this isnt Heavy Rain.
37:34 no Sean Cassidy already did that for you
oh god i killed my brother
we'll sorry Sean
Theory time what if they make more life is strangers like 3 then  a 4th one and so on and what if the last one all of them come together to form a super squad
when he cuts out D.A.N,C.E. by justice and its not the same /:

The best way to remember somebody is AÃàÃ§ KÃàÃ§IÃàÃ§SÃàÃ§SÃàÃ§
Just replay. I mean I looked too but gonna try other paths to experience it.
I would like to see a Life is Strange game where the main character has super speed, I think that would be super cool :)
Last episode I thought the voice Jack kept doing at the farm was Mater from Cars.
25:05 that dude just like glitched and I'm laughing
I got ad from oe of our political parytes ...
Why do you love relationships with people in life is strange
They pulled a Negan plotline when they were gonna steal from the boss. legit!
"you want me to come inside" youre a bit young for kids sean
You are turning into a nitpicky old man Jack.
aaaaaaaaah i love this series so much and cant wait for the next episode
51:42 jack turns into a chainsaw
DE-MON-IT-IZED
3:36 Stop your making me hungry
Wait wait wait: he drinked a beer and got a tattoo - dude you mustn‚Äôt do that üò¨
Is it just me, or is sean looking more like sean as the game goes on?
Sean and Daniel have taken their first steps to realising the truth...
Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.
Through Passion they gain Strength.
Through Strength they gain Power.
Through Power they gain Victory.
Through Victory their chains are Broken.
The Force shall free them.

>.>
Plz make an episode 4 plz this game is so good
Finn looks like lil pump xd
YouTube: DEMONITIZED
Wish he went with the Finn route xD
Sean they knew the mom was alive, she just keft without a word
I love how jack goes around and doesn't explore every option. Just finds the quickest answer
Please do another when it comes out or when you can! I love it!
Jack:-Makes excuse cuz he knows what is gonna witness 31:55 üòÇ
jack play (a plague tale)
i cant wait another 3 months for the next episode!!!
I think you're being too critical
Who else called it that Jack kills everyone.
Merrill?
More like Merrill-juana
Honestly there's a certain aesthetic to the tattoo.  A weird doodly aesthetic. I like it tbh >.>
daniel is basically tenn from the walking dead
THE MOM WAS ALWAYS ALIVE SHE LEFT THEM
So is Daniel Mob from Mob psycho 100
Daniel being a brat results in one thing...


His brother losing an eye.
Holy crud that is one bad ending for an episode
I came back to your channel I used   to watch your skate videos I like how your channel has grown
I don't know, Before the Storm is my favorite. Especially because of Rachel. And I wish too that the developers used Daniel's power more often. The whole thing between Sean and Cassidy was so sweet, I really liked that. Hopefully next episode there will be improvement with the audio and voice acting. I enjoyed the episode
MAKE A PART 3
nothing can best dbh!
jack a boy u got me at a bad time lol im at a camp
jack‚Äôs face in 29:30 PRICELESS
JACK!! Your eye.
Just wait until Dutch‚Äôs appearance in episode 4 he will have the best plan he just needs some money
Do you remember the grandmoms house she said they lost touch with the mom.
Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuh Daniel should get some lessons on how to use his powers from Mob......from Mob Psycho 100 if you haven't seen that anime...go watch it...please
25:11 that look in jacks eyes.. I sweat
They want to go there because there dad always wanted to go back you have to listen jack
I want jacks mug. Ok thx bye
i really wanted sean to have a power that wakes up in the end
Damn Daniel hurt who he was tryna protect the most. Makes sense . And I saw it coming but they still did a good job of exceeding my expectations.
51:04 jack created brightburn
It's so different without the music
Told ya Finn would piss you off! When I found out that they were going to do it anyway, I went back and said yes to Finn's request and then they made out. I was pleased lol
When Sean says we are all armed and shows his arms I was crying of laughter
Jack: "...Does anyone have a dog I could borrow?..."

Me: "I will personally go to the store and buy you one" ;)
Wow!! Amazing!  I can't wait to see what happens in the he next episode!!
25:06 stare at penny and witness the glitch in the matrix
33:58 that is exactly how I feel all the time
Can you do another play through but with the music?..?
First of all Daniel is just the worst and secondly Cassidy better not be dead üíÄ
Sean found a reason to use the condoms!
God, Daniels the worst.
 I don't often advise killing off the kid but. Yeah. Please
Get rid of Daniel
Sean should‚Äôve given himself a tattoo he‚Äôs the artist üòÇ
I reckon Sean does have a power, but I think its mild healing? Mean how many times has he got hurt because of daniels powers? Yet he seems to heal up within no time.
Dont get me wrong though. That eye is well gone üòÇ
33:44 "ook" LMAO
Septic eye got a bit literal
25:52 she... Omg she want to go skinny dipping üòÇüòòüòçüòÉü§£üòÇ
jack pls play hollow knight
Damn... ''you're alone, now.'' Did he diedededed? One man adventure from now on?
Daniel has just felt unlikable almost this entire series imo. Sean is a good character with his arc but Daniel hasn't really changed at all and it frustrates me
Sean now has a septic eye
when you were the younger brother? does that mean you somehow passed your siblings in age?
theyre gonna have a prison episode omg this game is wild
JACK, why dont you just cue up some ncs or something and play it while recording durring the parts that have no music...?
That felt like such a short episode
u mad a super mistake not a super villain
Sean's gonna get a septic eye after this episode! Hit the road, Jack (septic-eye)!
DO MORE DO MORE DO MORE DO MORE!!
Daniel the last air bender
I think Sean's dead, and we're gonna control Daniel now.
dude no :((( we didnt get the finn kiss
Sean kinda really smart somewhat
The weird this is, I am 17, but I have no Girlfriend.
I cant believe he let him cut his hairrrüò≠üòñ
Daniel is actually still one of my top characters along with Sean. I love him because of how extra he is and surprising.  Despite this episode, I still love my the brothers :)
Am i not supposed to watch this?
Oh you can borrow our dog please go ahead dig her grave up üò≠üò≠üê∂
as long as I can come with!
I got a feeling Sean is going to get powers too in the future
Parenting advice for Sean: 

At this point, he is essentially Daniel's father, so he should act that way. Daniel really isn't a little kid anymore, and teaching him things includes leaving Daniel to make his own decisions more often. I believe if Sean did nothing(both people, lol), Daniel would have responded anyway. It would have (probably)resulted in Finn getting killed, but Daniel would've then learnt to react to a situation on his own, instead of expecting to be pushed by Sean all the time.

Sean has to balance out teenhood and adulthood, this will cause drama naturally. I don't think IRL Sean has to push this, I find trying to developing a character kinda boring. I'd rather see characters develop like real people(with input from real people). So if IRL Sean has to skip an interesting scene because it it's bad for Daniel, I'm more than willing to accept that. I'd hate it if Daniel became a supervillain just for entertainment. Feeling something for a character in a game is essential to your own entertainment and that of anyone watching it.
Holy shit why can't that child just listen, I mean I get it he's just a kid but common he almost got a beating the first time that's gotta be an eye opener already of how serious the situation was , maybe it could have been better if Big joe beat up daniel maybe he'll actually listen more, damn Daniel feels like more and more of a brat as the episode continues 

And congrats on my boy sean finally getting it down
No Sean is still 16. It's February 2017 in the game. I think Sean's birthday is in July.
That ending, oh god...
Im probably the only one tht doesnt ship Cassidy and Sean lmao
Where was your editor this episode in that nsfw part
All I think is holy shit I want to play this
YouTube terms of service, hello???
How is this video still not age-restricted
did anyone else notice in the end credits there was a list of names titled "production babies" what is that about lol
Me when Daniel gets out of control with his powers: Brightburn?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
4:02 Sock's
Who else hates Daniel now
Honestly, this episode has been my favourite. I really dislike this game. But I love Cassidy's character so I think that's why I liked this episode
watch sean's face at 21:27- 21:36
Jack really never uses his head does he?
I just love how you make him do all the power decisions wrong, he will be a great sith to the war ;)
Am I the only one who said yes to the heist just so Sean could kiss Finn?üòÇ
"I know" lol
Cassidy is so attractive
its a good enough option that they even let you mute the claimed music and not narrow it down to all music. just be grateful, jack. you couldve just edited in some sound or something honestly =/
ur the one who chose to mute
The swedish chick is Kenny's wife from the walking dead
Jack, you missed out on way too many things. At least try to take note of the game.
I don't want the crew to split
I liked the ending that jack got but I kind of wish he went and kissed Finn instead of having Sean get with Cass
Turn back on the music. Ads totally don't mean anythingüòâ
Oh how i wish lyla was there and not cassidy
Honestly ill let you borrow my dog is yoir the one paying for the shipping-
It's all Daniels fault
Was that Finn at the end?
My sister was playing a whole new world in the next room when they were in tent making out . Bruh
FBI OPEN UP
I feel like Daniel is too uncontrollable. He‚Äôs young, and he knows he has power. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Daniel became a villain, or Sean had to stop him in some way.
i also just realized Daniel is the Mexican Darth Vader, he even has the force
You know what they say an 
An eye for an eye
I still miss Lyla..
It really sucks about the music :/ it really adds to the game imo.
I feel like the game just does a bad job in reminding the player that they're trying to get Sean and Daniel out of the country because they're basically wanted criminals and if they're out of the country, they'll be safe. Instead of having Sean discuss how they're gonna go to Puerto Lobos due to the whole Seattle fiasco and how they're criminals with the group during the bonfire scene, they let Daniel speak about how he lost his friends and father. Yeah, that's sad but I feel like the whole bonfire scene would have been more emotional if Sean brought it up again, since it seemed to have been discussed with the group, mainly Finn and Cass, before.

For episode 2, all I got from it was a very poorly executed build up to their mother's bedroom and fan service due to Captain Spirit. Though I appreciated the brothers attempting to have some form of connection with the mother's side of the family, I feel like, they could have emphasised this with little interaction with Captain Spirit and more interaction with the grandparents and have more interaction and conflict with them in regards to their mother. Instead of having them break into the bedroom, they could have had an emotional verbal argument with Daniel going off about how he never knew his mother causing their grandmother to give in.

I think what we all have forgotten is that their mother left them, but I myself have totally forgotten the reason why. I also have completely forgotten if their mother is in Puerto Lobos or not, but what I would like in the story to hopefully leave people shocked and surprised with their jaws hanging, is for the mother to have left the Diaz family due to her powers. It's cliche but it makes sense. It manages to answer the questions of how Daniel got his powers and why his mother left. It just completes the narrative of the game. If their mother is in Puerto Lobos, I hope it's not because she lives there, but I hope it was her attempt to see the boys again.
Seeing him get in that water with the tattoo made me cringe.
Daniel is that one kid who mess up everything
SEAN AND FINN COULD‚ÄôVE MADE OUT IF YOU SAID YES TO STEALING
1:06:05 
Either he played the episode first then recorded it or he somebody spoiled the choices for him but doesn‚Äôt that mean the reactions on this episode were fake????? üëπüíÄ
Cassidyxseanxxxx
I agree with Sean. I don't like emo Daniel.
You should‚Äôve age restricted this lol
Just started the video and I'm already ready for some conflict I think it's been two peaceful not that there's anything wrong with that but that's just how these games are
I feel shawn is dead and so is Cassidy I also had to add he is the new jacksepticeye
idk what the heck is this series now XD
45:38 saving my spot
So... did Sean finally get to use the condoms he kept in his bag?
DEMONITIZED
25:04 that glitch though
I think Hannah is pregnant. o.O
Also i have a cat you can borrow, he's cuddly lol
It was actually the first time that I wanted to punch Daniel in the face for being a brat
Was gonna play this with my 7 year old probably not the best idea
DANIEL PISSES ME OFF SO FREAKIN MUCH. I WOULD'VE BEEN SO TEMPTED TO ABANDON THIS KID FOR PUTTING ME THROUGH THIS.
He diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Did anyone else get a sense of deja vu or is it just me cuz I remember being 5 years old I had a glass in my eye you can imagine how scary that is for a kid and if you're wondering yes I'm fine I just can't see very well out of it although I did hurt like s***ü§îüòÑüíû
Jack trying to do a accent gave me the biggest headache
I feel like jack has forgotten that they have family in mexico
Got a condom ad right before Sean went swimming with Cas. It was a sign
That would happen either way because Daniel is a little psychopath
3 months???? Smh.
jack finna shane dawson our dogs
Bad brother = bad brother :P
I really wanna see Sean have powers idk whyyy maybe sum with blue electric or sum . Anythingggg
lol he forgot how to do his outro
DO I REALLY HAVE TO WAIT SO MUCH JUST TO SEE IF F@CKING SEAN CASSIDY DANIEL AND FIN ARE OKAY ?!
Casedy is the girl version of jack the truth
Sean: Daniel use ‚ÄúSUICIDE‚Äù
Tbh i hope next episode we get to play as Daniel, even for half of it. That way they can really flesh him out more and we get the fun of using his powers more, instead of only playing as Sean, telling Daniel "yes, use them"/"no, don't use them". And if the brother's are apart from each other now, it would make much more sense to see both POV.
Give Daniel the attention he deserves ‚ÄúSean‚Äù
Can u do life is strange for your next video please
Okay so Sean set sean up with a girl coincidence I think not
Got a German Shepard that I'm giving away. You want It
CAMERA ONE
30:18 sooo cringe
Daniel reminds me of Vanya from Umbrella academy
There's a limit to how much I can take off Daniel
That was hard for me to see Seans eye when I played it a week ago. Finn drove a wedge between Daniel and Sean.
I really want jack to make or be a part of making one of these story driven kind of games. After listening to his criticism i know for a fact that the story would be awesome!
Can anybody tell Max I see her pretending not to see me?
Awesome play! good stuff.
Chris Handsen walks in
About the first episode and the mom thing.

I like the idea. It makes more sense to have a sort of introduction to the whole Diaz family during the first episode, build up this "bond" between Esteban (the father) and the player, and then end it off on the seemingly abrupt car topple that we saw in the teaser for the game, and Esteban's death. But, if the devs were to do that, the writers'd have to really try and implement the whole mom thing well, since it's likely an ongoing thing that Karen is actually alive and the brothers have no idea about it. Just to have this big reveal to the characters when you barely really feel connected with the world would likely fall a bit flat. But, then again, we  talking about the company who made Life Is Strange, so they'd likely pass with flying colors if that was what they wanted to do.
Call me crazy, but if Daniel gonna turn out to be the main bad guy at the end of all this? Or is this another Atreus from Dad Of BOY situation?
Ah of course it ends there... But omg, Finn, you kinda suck, and Daniels not very likeable anymore :/
18:18 
Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it fo it do it do it do it...

45:45
Do it do it do it do it do it do it...

Edit: noooooooooooooooo!
I really wanted Sean to end up with Finn, but when Finn pulled that stuff with Daniel I was just kinda disappointed and frustrated
Merrill's voice is too deep for his body
That was so very intense. Oh my. Im sorry sean! That eye is a goner now.
I swear to God if Cass is dead, I'm done.
29:35 is it me or does this voice line sound weird
Cass is trans. I'm calling it
6:43 and i oop-
who kinda thinks cassidy and sean could be a great couple
What if Daniel is blaming himself for his Dad and Mushroom's death. Leaving him alone on a pot farm with super powers probably was a Brightburn move.
easy wayy to solve this problem,report the weed farm.
Sean and Sean both got a hurt eye
see ya guys again in august i think probs
Life is gay am I right boys raises hand
sean: doesn't even get hit pass'sout because of fear
Glad to know im not the only person that hates Daniel
25:06 the party gets so crazy one person decides to phase between dimensions
Ok so my prediction for episode 4, we get a time skip, Daniel is alone thinking that Sean is dead
He doesn't end up going to Mexico and just becomes a wanderer, travelling around hence why he is so old and still just wandering
there goes Sean's eye.
Anyone thinking this game is like elfen lied sometimes
Demonetized
ITS ARIES SEASON
40:08 i see sean has one and of those gamer bottomless pocket
Anyone else see Ingrid fly across the screen at like 25:50?
I miss Lila
So another video with a different ending
FIrst of sean I would like to apologize for skippong the end credits of any video games that you've covered, i'm now realizing that I've misse out on so many more oppertunities that I have realized. Now to answer your question I think it was the wrong desicion to use daniel's powers because he hasn't shown any signs to sean (in the game) that he can use them in a practical use without harming others around him. I also wished he'd use his powers more but I believe that because sean didn't see that in him earlier daniel never had the courage to use his powers more throughout the episode. I hope that makes sense Jack and if you've read this far I'd love to know your thoughts as well, and also if their was anything that didn't make sense I'dlove to answer any question.
That was the most awkward yet cute romance scene in a video game ever
On the next episode, where Sean wakes up and awakens his superpowers
SEANS FUCKDING EYE NOOOOO
At like 33:50 I was dyingüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ how awkward it is without the musicüòÇ
so uhhhhh... sean is 18 right?
he is so damn safe
Pick and poke tatts are
since when is nudity allowed i'm suprised youtube hasn't taken down the first episode yet but also happy cause its just 2 or 3 seconds of the whole video
Guess Sean now has a septic eye.
This is what deaf people experience on phub
And danial saying they wont tell they saod there wouldnt, flash back to danial saying he wouldnt move as he ruins everybodys job
33:26 
Darude Sandstorm starts playing
This isn't the last episode is it? I'm asking before I look at it. Cause I want to watch the whole thing in one go
30:15 my checkpoint
Daniel such a pain lmao
demonitized
Big Joe has a little joe
54:11 how we thought nick fury  lost his eye
33:52 In the living room with my grandma :|
Definitely from a player standpoint, it would make more sense to build the whole interaction between the kids and the dad in the first episode, but I don't  know that that makes it better storytelling.  The fact that Sean and Daniel are just living a normal life when everything unexpectedly goes to shit, with no sort of preparation before hand, is more honest storytelling in my opinion.  Your main character is a teenager, and this is a time when you DON'T want to spend a bunch of ooey-gooey family time with your parents, for the most part.  Sean is practically embarrassed when his dad hugs him, because he's a teenager, and no matter how much he loves his dad (and it is clear he loves his dad very much), he's at that point where he wants to be treated like a man, not a kid.

So the fact that we don't have all this time with the boys and dad together I feel is more honest storytelling, and the fact that we can spend so little time with dad and still be horrified when he is needlessly gunned down by a trigger-happy cop really says a lot.  Sean just going about his day, trying to have time to himself and get ready for a party before everything goes crazy and he goes on the run with Daniel leaves the player in that "holy shit, now what the fuck do we do?" mindset right there with the boys.  I disagree that the first episode needs changing just to be a cohesive story.

This episode, however, in terms of meandering from the narrative.  This episode was kinda all over the place.  I think they could have hit all the high points without it having to be homeless kids working on a pot farm.
Wait why has jack not been asked to be in a movie
Sean listen to me FOR THE INTRO:TOP TO YA LADIEES  MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYEEE  and play mortal kombat 11 everyone request this AND GET YOUR GREEN HAIR BACK
i feel like it would have worked better by just combining the 2nd and 3rd episode.
i like the ways jack is fiddling around the story. but i think just combing the 2nd and 3rd would have been a simpler way to be less boring.
HIS POWER LEVEL IS OVER 9000
Life is Strange 2 is absolute garbage compared to Life is Strange 1. You can't change my mind
I feel like Daniel will become a villain of the Life Is Strange Universe/Franchise
You know that's messed up I tried every ending and it inevitably ends bad
At least he didn‚Äôt die as a virgin forever
Life is strange2 Episode3:  try not to cringe challenge
DUDE PLEASE GET EPISODE 4 OF LIFE IS STRANGE 2
Avoids copywrited music, gets demonetized anyway
I didn't like the outcome of this episode, but I know it's to get this story going.... I just hope we get a satisfying ending...
actually if you do want to be an adult, making bad decisions is part of waht adults do.
Wouldn't it be cool if we see Daniel bring down a mountain with his powers that be so cool
I think the mum's going to have powers
Sean didn‚Äôt even get to brush his teeth :(
Bets on meeting Max and Chloe next episode? I mean they're in California and Los Angeles was where Max and Chloe planned on going
WASNT THAT LAKE TOXIC???
Thank you Jack for noticing that neither Daniel nor Finn are to be seen anywhere because I thought I was the only one who noticed
honestly though all the bad things happen just because daniel‚Äôs being petty so
I hope Daniel doesn‚Äôt disappear, I love that kid üò¢. His lack of attention makes me sad, too.
I hope chapter 4 gets a bit more action in the middle of the chapter.  I like character development and all, but it is somewhat annoying having the only action sequences be and the very end of the chapter.
There going to Mexico because Mexico has no extradition and they wouldn‚Äôt be fugitives
She said this "damn daniel"
Last time I trusted somebody I lost an eye.
Right now i'm disapointed why dosen't sean have powers but daniel
jack why dont u just make your own game
Just obey Meril. Don‚Äôt escalate the situation
The dude in the thumbnail to the right looked like dantdm
Daniel cmon now I've seen other characters younger than you like Clementine catch on to what they need to do to survive quicker than you have like you need to stop whining in listen to your older brother
I wonder how long Sean lasted.
Is it only me or does Cassidy's face looks like Sean's? üòÆ (the character I mean, not JacksepticeyeüòÇ)
37:37 oh god
That end tho...
Hi I love life is strange
Jack what you think makes more sense would be too cliche which is why the way they do it makes it more fun
I HATE DANIEL
HEY LISTEN
26:35 üòÇ
His power
I bet Sean has healing powers or something
Well the child has just gained teleportation.
another AJ
a super AJ...jeez
Next minute Max comes in and rewind's time like she is more powerful then daniel she can make a ecplise and a tsunami
Why do I feel like this video and the previous are gonna be taken down
They talk about their mom if you go to bed with Daniel.
tbh I kinda hate Daniel in this episode...
I think sean is perished and daniel has become older
HE'S A SITHLORD I CALLED IT
Did you forget to censor or what?
why is your face cam smaller
If you made the other Finn would die and Daniel would be extra angry
Didn‚Äôt noticed the finn kiss choice
Awwwww big joe
I get why people would not like Daniel in this episode but if you go through everything it makes a lot of sense.
1) He lost his dad
2) He's had to give up everything he's known for the entirety of life before that point
3) lost his dog
4) Thought he let friend near the grandparents place down by lying to him
And now his brother, probably the only person he can actually trust is hanging out with other people, leaving him alone and saying they can't go to their mom.. Of course he's acting bratty he wants love plus he's nine. Honestly I feel bad for daniel.
Powers come from their ancestors
aw, shit. here we go agane
...is Sean dead?
Ingrid totally sounds swedish, at the least very Scandinavian. The voice actress is from Iceland iirc, the languages are closely related and pronunciations are similar.
30:57 pause
I like Daniel but to be fair I think he's been the problem the whole time, from the beginning. Does anyone agree? If not, please don't be too harsh on my opinion.
Do you have a tattoo?
I like your mug, unt
its like the walking dead all over again
If someone asked me to kiss them i would say no  and just make it as awkward as possible
At 25:58, anyone else see Ingrid just nyoom across the screen real quick?
I want moreeeeee
What if Daniel has is Powers because of his mom and maybe that‚Äôs why she left?ü§îü§Øüòè
boioioioing
How is the credits as long as the Bible but they can‚Äôt make a clean polished game
33:43
HI GUYS IN NEW ON THIS CHANNEL HOPE YOU WELCOME ME
Wonder what the plan was
God damn it, I was watching this before going to sleep, how the hell am I supposed to sleep now!?!?!?!?!?!
She actually thought the wolf was good but I would have been hesitant to say it‚Äôs good
Daniel I understand that you really love your brother Sean but if you love someone you don't control them and take hold over them you can't expect them to be with you 24/7 just like you hang out with Finn without  Sean sometimes he can do the same with Cassidy and y'all will always be brothers
i think it was cool to have both cassidy and finn in this episode so you could choose which romance path you want to go down
Life is strange 1 is better than 2
How many people think Sean got Cassidy pregnant?
Why not add your own music
more!
They don't know where the Mom actually is, they just lost their jobs, and puerto lobos is where their father grew up and likely still has family.
Life is strange 1 was way better
Damn, Daniel
Who took the money
Man who else is bummed that we have to wait another 3 months for the next episode
Violet vibes in the ending of Sean
That went real bad real fast
I‚Äôm honestly hating Daniel and Sean the choices here are not the best in my opinion
I think the mother might have the power too... Jacob said "it can't be random"... and maybe that's why the mother left? Maybe she was scared when she found out she had powers ?
What do you think?
I don't really like how Daniel doesn't listen to Sean and shit, but I was sad when he got shot just because he's a kid. Hopefully he's okay and I hope the next episode comes out soon because I need to know what happens to everyone.
NO SPOILERS
At 1:59 he looks like he's taking a dump
That eye tho
you should have done nothing and let fiin get killed
2:03 his voice doesn't match his face
First off,  jack asking if there even at legal drinking age, overlooks the fact of them working at a illegal pot farm, hmmm dose it really matter
I still think they may end up giving Sean powers as well, possibly something that has to do with the eye that keeps getting hurt.
Chasity like i be stroking
Sean! I remember now! Cassidy and Finn were the ones that you saw with Sean's grandparents when you went to that little fair thingy. The train hoppers! edit: Literally hit enter right before Cassidy said "we met at the market" edit 2: I think if you chose Finn as your lover Cassidy might have been the one to do the money heist? I dunno.
;)
27:46 lol
yasssss
I don‚Äôt have a dog but we have a lot of cats you can borrow. üòä
I think once they're in Mexico they think they might be untouchable/can make new identities and be at less risk of cops tracking them there? Plus didn't the dad have a cabin over there or something?
Jack! he is you! he's got a septiceye too!
Jack get ready to delete this video sooner for showing nudes
29:15
I guess if Jack does become a father, then he would be an awkward father when talking to his kid about things like this!
I can't neglect my brother because I don't have friends.
33:07just his face
Why are y'all so mad at this nine year old who just lost his father, is constantly on the run, doesn't have any friends his own age, the one person he's close to would rather spend his time with others, and he's told to keep his power away at all times. Of course he's mad af ~
Does anyone think whenever they say Daniel in the game Matt Watson saying damn Daniel comes up in there mind because I do
daniel in this episode reminded me a bit of atreus in god of war, both kids start getting cocky after discovering the potential of their powers and stop listening to their mentor figures.
33:48 EXACTLY
I played the first Life Is Strange and I really liked it. I keep watching the videos for each new one, Before the Storm, Captain Spirit, and now this. Honestly, the only one I even liked was the first one and they seem to be getting progressively worse. The choices in this episode didn't even matter at all.
I agree that the direction for some of the voice acting could be better. The game hinges on these choices being tough because you're invested with these characters, but it's hard to be invested when the dialogue gets unnatural.
I don‚Äôt know y but I think u have to kill Daniel soon in episode 5 maybe
53:53
Big Joe looks like my dad.
goddamn i hate eye trauma yikes
WTF IT CANT JUST END LIKE THAT!!!!!
Is that the end
You can have my puppy
Your choices matter a lot more than you think!! You totally ignored everyone but Cassey baciclly.. wHeN wiLl yOu lEaRn!!
Is it just me, or does Sean do and AMAZING impression of a hippy dude at 26:35 - 26:46. Seriously, why is this man not a professional voice actor!!!
I'd like to say something about the tattoo part,  jack seemed to think it was ugly


But just know not a tattoos have to be pretty some are just based on a reason like I've seen some people get ugly written letter from their kids tattooed on em,  Sean got that tattoo to remember which in way is gonna make him love it even more than just a normal good tattoo
thats a nice cup you have jack
Maybe dontnod and square enix will make Sean have a meet up with Max and Chloe.
Do y'all ever have that moment were you taking a piss and you shake to make sure it's all out and then you put on your pants and a jolt of piss just comes out and runs down your legs
Why are you guys so pissed at Daniel? wtf.
He lost his dad, then had to runaway from home, having to obey his brother, discovered powers, had to deal with the police. Then suddenly his brother started to not pay much attention to him and was manipulated by a guy he really trusted (Finn), also had to work on a pot farm and get SHOT. AND HE IS FUCKING NINE. Give him a break.
danos end game
Daniel the Bad Airbender
39:29
I like this game so much I screamed when he said the next episode comes out in 3 months.
i guess in the next ep sean will wake up and it will be his super power im just gessing
It looks like a 4 year old drew that wolf no offense thoüòÇüòÇ
Daniel it's just overwhelmed with all the events happening all simultaneously like he literally got shot in the shoulder so even though past Tendencies had shown that he was acting like a villain in the making I don't think this counts as anyting because his powers are very attached to his emotion and if he's overwhelmed I feel like his powers will overwhelm him too
1:08:45 i think daniel is a supervillain now
That‚Äôs sad. The different endings arent drastically different
It was very weird watching the sex scene without music
Nudity and Sean still has ad revenue
There are other paths replay till you've played it from every possible angle. It's a game. Someone dumped on me for saying that  back in episode 2. You'd think people would now that by now as Life is strange and before the storm were the same way.
I really don't like Daniel anymore!
Jack should just bust out his drums when there is a scene with no music
ffs, Daniel...
Is this the last episode?
Knew the condoms would come in handy
Merrill God damn can you let someone talk for once actually Sean came to stop Daniel and Finn and so did Cassidy
Did anyone else noticed that Sean and finn could‚Äôve kissed
i cant wait to see the next episode and will  Sean be wearing a badass eye patch. if we ignored Cassidy will Daniel not go out with Finn or is it gonna be the same i guess its gonna be the same
Why yoy gota ruin this for me
33:55 I put on 'Lets get it on'
Kill Merrill and big Joe
13:41 No. They aren't related.
Merril and Daniel were nowhere to be seen in that last scene, so I'm thinking that maybe he took Daniel to the police station or something along those lines.
51:10 he mad af
I agree with the criticism, although I think overall, it‚Äòs still a good game even if it‚Äòs not comparable for me with season 1.
But, I‚Äôm really confused about he mum now, Karen... did I get it wrong that they already knew that she just left them years ago, but they just did‚Äòt know that someone (like the grandparents) were still in contact with her and that she is still interested in her boys?
Or did they really think the mother died until that letter?
I HAVE A DOG
I think it would be best to go back and redo this episode to see where it goes considering we didn't get much out of Wastelands and waited so long for it.
35:17 Who is caught it that he had a weak pull out game
That wolf tattoo looks like my problems
NSFW
33:23 is like your watching a movie with your parents and THIS comes on.... and you can't do nothing about it
(To minds think alike eh?)
Jack, I have 3 dogs, have one if you want
ALL AD MONEY GONE
This plan is even worst then ducth plan
You can borrow my dog to Sean... So that when you return him, i can gloat at everyone about how my dog has been touched by God. :D
is Sean dead
1:09:58 Yeah the descisions are smoke and mirrors, but I feel like they still have value, being able to explore minor variations on these events. Like you got the date with Cassidy thing, while others got that sweet moment with Daniel you mentioned. In something like a movie they have to pick one of those scenes and cut the other. Not to mention in the begining you can learn about all those other characters you talked to, or not. It aint perfect, and the fact that games need to make money still affects it, but i feel the value for this style of game as it is still is there
Deceased rat
55:29 no nine year old is THAT complainy. at nine years old thats when you dont wanna hang out with your siblings. they seem to be writing daniel like hes 5 years old
Sean had the best trims. You can't fuckung touch Daniel. That boy is finna kill you. WHAT IS WITH THE OVERREACTION DAMN. And then taking away everyone's payday tf
A Light Little Whapoosh
damn daniel
damn daniel
That haircut you get is not worth any points you‚Äôd get from Cass afterwards, I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt get it
39:58
wow ok
Sean is so awkward
Nooooooooo
I can see why the ending messed up. It because he used POWER. It hasn't changed since life is strange 1. Choosing a life of a person by using power can let thousands of people die
I see an boobdemono
no they aren't actual brother and sister because cassidies brother was one one the reasons she left
not being with your brother enough will affect him. if you werent nice to him in the last episode and said "tell chris about your powers" he wouldn't, he'd lie.
How did this not get demonetized? I mean, they were literally naked. No hate, just confused as to how this demonetized thing works. Also, Daniel and Finn are now my MOST hated characters on this game!!! I knew Finn would take Daniel anyway even without Sean's permission. Also, I think that Cassidy should really come with Daniel and Sean when or if they go to Puerto Lobos. She is always talking about seeing new places and meeting new people. She should take this chance, plus I really want Cassidy and Sean to get to know each other better. Just my feedback.
Um im 12 and this love thing kinda cringing me out
DAMN DANIEL
It‚Äôs so weird when he keeps saying ‚ÄúCassidy‚Äù.. well cause that‚Äôs my name...
Big mojo
Damn... Now who will be hero?
Y‚Äôall negative people that don‚Äôt think Daniel is a good character shouldn‚Äôt watch if your gonna whine about it
9:01 damn Daniel
I hate life is strange 2
I want to know what info Finn was feeding to Daniel while Sean wasn't around... I know he's just a kid but they will pretty much listen to anyone that gives them the time of day and although Daniel had his problems with not getting what he wants. This whole being pissed at Sean thing feels way too much for him to have conjured up on his own. After all Finn did call Daniel, "Seans secret weapon" after they came back from working.. Then followed it up with the more you try to control him the less you will have. Maybe (if Finn isn't dead) he will confess up to something?
my eyes
yayüòÇ
I'm so sad the music's muted... It takes SO MUch away from the game... I know why Jack did it, and that I can watch it with the licenced music on other channels. but it's just not the same...
i have two dogs and i live in greece soooooo kindof a hustle to borrow
you should have grabbed the condoms before you went in the tent
Finally
i dissvlikee seann, just cuz now, he isnt the sweet boi i know, (i just dont like thr hair, no offense to the people that like the new hair)
I think the mom has powers because Sean is not related to the mother but Daniel is so he must get the powers from his mom
When Sean asked if anyone has a dog he can borrow I looked over and asked mine if she wanted to be borrowed and got a blank stare back üê∂üê∂
Yeah I chose not to use the damn power at the end and well bye bye Finn. I thought that I could of talked things out with him. I thought that if I used my power I might of accidentally set the gun off killing someone. BUT I was wrong :( üí©üí©üí©üí©
34:49 i have a dog!
jack, can you just stop comparing the first life is strange to this one, I know it's sequel to the first but the story is different. in the first game you played a girl who has the powers but this one you are playing a person who's little brother has powers. in the first since you have time powers you have to think about the choices you make and make a wrong mistake you use the powers to get better outcome but in this one you have to takecare and teach/guide your brother since he's just a child who doesn't know shit and what's worst than a child who doesn't know shit, a child who has powers and doesn't know shit which makes him cocky and shit like that and thats where you come in  to try to protect your little brother from his stupidity and cockiness because he thinks he's powerful with those powers. so stop comparing the usage of power of both games, 
What happened to penny?
didnt you get a chance to choose between going to puerto lobos and trying to find the mother earlier on in the game?
Why call it life is strange, it‚Äôs kinda almost ripping off the first game if there isn‚Äôt any characters from it
20:47 
Oh, well imagine

As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor

And I can't help but to hear

No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words

Kinda sounds like that song.
After you upload these to YouTube, do you replay it with music? the Life is Strange series games soundtrack creates a great atmosphere. Sucks that you are playing it without music the first time.
15:00 yeah they probably are at legal drinking age as they look like they‚Äôre in their late teens, they referred to themselves as adults multiple times. I think they must be legal drinking age, even if they‚Äôre 18 they can drink.
I like the stuff with Sean and Kassidy but I feel like he's getting distracted I hope this doesn't bite him in the ass and Finn doesn't do something stupid because I love Finn I love them all
I love Finn, but I hope in episode 4 you can give him some shit for bringing Daniel to Merrill's, even though Sean told him no.
I want to kill daniel
‚ÄúNo. You can‚Äôt make this into some cosmic bullshit‚Äù ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs Aries season‚Äù JACK WHY üòÇ
Big joe just walks out done with this shit when Sean stole his car
Is it a thing for big YouTubers to have big beards?
jack your so good with your mouth
Hopefully this episode is a wakeup call to the little shiy
Dude no one will call the cops they all hate the police and government
So looking back at the end choices (spoilers), either Finn died and Daniel would be upset and lash out with his powers, or Daniel would hate sean and use his powers regardless. Keeping that in mind, as bad as this played out, it looks like Jack picked the best ending by supporting his brother and his powers, all while saving both Finn (Daniels friend) and Cassidy (Sean's friend) and keeping everyone alive. I honestly believe this was the best ending we could have gotten (yes, I know how you feel about Finn but Daniel likes him so imagine how messed up or hurt Daniel would be if he died, he might have never forgiven Sean for letting him die).

I bet we playin‚Äô as daniel next time...
I hate that this ends here
Hi
Yo, shawns gonna look pretty cool with an eyepath though.
Me reacting to daniel's powers again
is he a jedi? Worthy??.. He's a jedi im sure
Or that Sean and Daniel get into a life is death situation and Sean gets his powers like his brother and blows something up better than his brother and gets wasted like Daniel in the beginning
Why is everybody saying that daniel is the worst character? Hes just confused but still a good kid
JACK YOU DID A PROFESSIONAL JOB AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST SERIES IN HISTORY AND IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SERIES IN A FEW MONTHS THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK ü§óüôÇüëåüëçüèÜ
Am i the only one that really likes Finn? I know his decision was really stupid and wouldn't help sean and Daniel's situation but if you think about Finn perspective,it makes sense as to why he'd want to do that. Everyone in that group deserves better and i know Finn wants that he just didnt know how to do achieve that in a safe way i guess. I just think Finn had good intentions <3
I'm at 10:50 in the video, but I feel like at some point mabye this episode or some other Sean might get powers a mabye but not sure.
Also can we get some F's in the chat for Sean's left eye.
The only question I have about going to Mexico is do they have there passport and don‚Äôt you think the police would inform border patrol
This is why I don't like most kids characters they just make some unnecessary things.
I swear there should be more girls like cassidy just like oh your a virgin its fine dont be nervous just it doesnt matter
Why does he keep thinking that someone thought their mum was dead? No one said the mum was dead, Shaun knew she was alive all along.
Is it only me that hates it when protagonists or mc falls in love especially when they have siblings to take care of? Oh only me? Okay.
They never thought the mom died. She abandoned their family to go who knows where. Sean fully knows that and that's why he is so against going to her or her family for anything. Daniel was so young when it happened that he doesnt have any actual memory of it. So he's got a bit more of a fantastical view of his mom, and therefore wants to go to her
Daniel turned into a windy shitbag this episode
Daniel says he's not a kid anymore then goes and acts like a bratty kid! Just cuz you throw a tantrum, doesn't mean you get to use your powers. Listen to Sean for once Daniel! P.S. Cassidy helped you more than hurt you, so what you did was unfair to her...
Hi my name's Daniel I got shot in the shoulder then decided to use my psycho powers to destroy this house
LIL UZI, LIL PUMP, MGK , TECH 9INE are the aliases of some of these characters lol.
I have two theories for the next episode: One is, if Sean is dead, you're going to play as Cassidy and travel with Daniel to Mexico. The second is based on the last cutscene where we see either Sean or Daniel walking. In this situation Daniel was abandoned and we get to play as him in his teens/adulthood. But if the way there would only take a month as Sean said, it couldn't be Daniel, since he is only nine years old. Also because of the desert we can assume he's in Arizona or Mexico already (since in Episode 3 you're in California)
Daniel has easily become a very unlikable character, Even if he is a Kid, He acts like he‚Äôs better then Sean who‚Äôs trying to be a father figure and a Brother at the same time, and he makes serious mistakes like going with Finn to steal money, and Sean has to pay the price for Daniels mistakes

I get he‚Äôs trying to prove he‚Äôs responsible but at this point I don‚Äôt really sympathize with his character, and because of his Powers Sean lost an Eye, Because Sean was Right  and he paid the price for it.
The only way to keep Cassidy out of danger is by changing your mind on the heist and she runs off.
Upload the next ONE PLSSSS
Jack, they already knew the mom wasn't dead. They never thought that she was dead. She divorced the dad and left them. There was an whole flash back of Sean saying he hated his mom for that reason üòÇ
The real question is why. He would easily have killed Cassidy for no reason why not just kill Merrill with no evidence because of his powers grab the money and leave? Jesus this episode was a mess
Am I the only person that didnt want Daniel to get laid with Cassidy?
31:35 no Sean that‚Äôs how babies are made
Jack thinks 2nd episode is pointless and i understand why he thinks that cause there was srsly no point but when u actually start to think about it..Chris is somehow an important character in this game. They put a whole different storyline for him and Daniel and Chris needed to meet each other in the 2nd episode. Why? I mean, i don't know..We still have 2 more episodes going and maybe they make a sequel called.."After that" like with Before The Storm. In my opinion, i do think Chris still has some important figure here even tho we didn't see much of him now. Maybe their mother has some kind of connection with Chris's father or smth? I forgot but i know we saw that letter when we find out Chris's father has a relathionship with someone..Maybe that's their mom. Either way, the end of this game is probably gonna be very very tragic and idk if i'm mentally prepared for it. I just think something bad is gonna happened to Daniel or Chris. And i think we will see Chris again. Btw, who tf called the police at the end of the 2nd episode? Was it Chris's father? It was never mentioned tho
I have dog in my house if you want you can borrow it sean he is a pug
I feel like one of them is going to die in the finale episode, probably Daniel???
OKAY BUT JACK IF YOU CHOSE TO AGREE TO STEAL FROM MERRILL WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO FINN YOU WOULD'VE KISSED HIM INSTEAD OF CASSIDY
Fun fact about legal American Drinking age Jack, each state has it's own law about it. Some don't allow it until 21, and some ,like my home state , allow under-aged drinking as long as it's under adult supervision and not in public. In public or attending a bar you have to be 21.
I like Sean, he is trying is best to live his life and take care of his little brother. Yet the corrupted kid just try to kill his girlfriend without showing any remorse after that.
I know he is a kid but that does not make this forgivable in any ways. 
I've know a lot of kids who got mental disorder because they had a lot of traumatism yet they were still nice.
I would not be surprised if Daniel becomes a supervilliain and Sean has to discover his own power (if he has one) to stop him.
How do you hold a flashlight like that 40:18
Don't read if u dont wanna be spoiled!








I feel like that Daniel and Sean will be separated somehow because at the ending the unknown police officer says "you're all alone now" and it's just a boy walkin alone by himself so I'm assuming that'll be Daniel.
It sucks so and we can't hear music
why do i feel daniel is the cause of the storm in the original life is strange, it wouldn't really make sense since it already happened .. i know.. but after seeing daniel do that at the end it really reminded me of the storm.
i hate Daniel
Your CRUSH will MAKE OUT with you very soon!

Like and s√ªBSCribe to my channel to make it come true
Every one: Oh no the walking dead is not going to be finished because telltale closed down, life is strange 2: you always hang out qith that guy what about me
Honestly I do see why Daniel reacted the way he did. Like he clearly needs parental guidance, which Sean is meant to do, but hasn't been doing. And he can't really get it from anyone else there, since they behave more like Daniel's friends than parental figures. Like throughout this episode, Daniel keeps trying to spend time with Sean, and I do feel like part of that is because he wants Sean's guidance, because Sean is the closest thing Daniel has to a parental figure/rode model. So of course when Daniel doesn't get that, he's going to act out. Because 1: he's upset that Sean hasn't been there for him when he needed it. And 2: he's probably frustrated that whatever he needs help with isn't working when he tries to do it his way. It also makes sense why Daniel stopped listening to Sean, and started listening to Finn. I mean, if someone wasn't there for me when I needed them, I probably wouldn't listen to them either, like what Daniel is most likely doing to Sean. Finn on the other hand, has shown that 1: he's there when Daniel needs help, like when Sean said he and Daniel would train, but Sean forgot, so he and Finn practiced with knifes. And 2: Finn is willing to spend time with Daniel, like a good percentage of this episode is Daniel and Finn spending time with each-other. I understand why Sean is mad with Daniel, but I do think he really needs to look at things from Daniel's perspective to actually fix what's happening between him and Daniel.
I have an Australian Shepherd you can borrow for a week. She's really sweet and would make you not want a dog anymore because she can be really annoying too lol.
sanja
Honestly kids actions are HEAVILY based off how they are treated,so yes, this was bassicaly Seans foult but then again Sean is also just a kid and doesent know that the best way to teach is by example and if rules are put they should be explained, and also-this is just a game,its not likeit let you do any of that
I like where this game went, where you take the back seat to see a super do things instead of being the super. It takes a new side of the superhero/supervillain story
People really like to sympathize with Daniel and be like "Oh he's gone through so much it's ok" but let's not forget that Sean's been going through the same and worse,having to figure out where to hide them,food,taking care of Daniel he was essentially forced to become an adult at like 16 years old and manage all these things and that's a thing that most teenagers can't do if Finn was his brother instead in the same situation they'd be either already dead/in jail or he would've abandoned Daniel
At the beginning where the guy was about to beat Daniel. Jack said something along the lines of him not being able to control himself. As a big brother I would of told him to kill joe and protect himself
Am I the only one who reads the older comments and then makes a comment based on an old comment so mine gets read?
i was hoping for Sean revealing his power man, i wish sean has powers...     >_<
I gotta say I‚Äôm not a fan of this season season 1 was perfect fairly lighthearted but slowly descending into more darker things like Nathan kidnapping Chloe then Kate trying to commit suicide then Chloe being shot and the dark room all of that crazy stuff but it this it just seems like the most generic teen shit ever.
Poor Daniel... I feel like people are just being too judgemental towards him. He was out of control yes and he barely listened to anything Sean said, but wouldn't you be that way too if you were in his situation? A 9 year old kid who causes his own dad's death, he suddenly finds himself handling a huge power he can barely control and understand, he becomes homeless, not getting enough food and living in the dirt for months, his older (yet still young) brother is the only adult figure he can look up to but he sees him getting distant from him because he hangs out with other people... and yes, Sean has all the right to make new friends and hang out with them, he's also young and he needs to make his own life experiences, but still try to be in Daniel's shoes. A 9 years old kis needs parents, needs adults, needs guidance, especially now that he has this power he barely comprehends. A 9 years old is not supposed to act and think like an adult (like most of us watching I assume).
"but if it was me at that age I wouldn't have acted so dumb and be a little shit like him" yeah you also didn't cause your own father's death, you didn't have a super power and you weren't homeless.
Gosh I yet have to find a person who at least tries to understand Daniel's feelings...


I like Daniel, he's a good kid who just got on a difficult path.
Also if Daniel becomes a villain it's going to become even more interesting.
all the dislikes are merrille and big joe
I can‚Äôt watch anymore today at 37:28 is were I couldn‚Äôt handle it. It‚Äôs too damn much I will finish it later
You should have went with Finn‚Äôs idea but fin would‚Äôve died but you still would‚Äôve not died
My bad but Daniel is now another reason why I hate disobedient kids. I don't like him..
But Sean should have brought up the "Do you want to hurt people?" card to at least warn the kid that he could possibly hurt or even kill if he doesn't control himself. At least giving a small talk about serious stuff without arguing EVEN ONCE.
If your responsibilities become liabilities, just abandon them. Take Daniel out the back door and pop him in the head and then yourself.
What should have happened is Daniel should have collapsed one of big Joe's lungs therefore letting him live but the boss would have to call an ambulance. During the call, Daniel would take the money from the safe and steal the truck parked out front. They use Daniels powers to remove the plates until they get out of the forest. They could use the money to buy a decent used car and ride down to Mexico and live a good life.
I have to say, I found Daniel very unlikable from the start. The fact that he was na√Øve and/or arrogant with his powers‚Äîwhile also completely disregarding his brother‚Äôs requests‚Äîdid not help. Idk, he came off as a nuisance, then evolved into a complete, arrogant brat (Keep in mind, i‚Äôm only saying this towards the choices and paths shown in this play through; I have no clue if his personality varies?)
I have a quick theory, We all know Daniel is starting to look like a villain (like what jack said) so maybe this will cause Sean to unlock some hidden power. If he does awaken this hidden power, i don't think it will be like Daniel's powers, i think it will be a more observant based power. This isn't a really good theory, judging the whole thing revolves around Daniel becoming a villain. It's a half ass theory but it was on my mind when watching this episode, so i just wanted to share it.
They don‚Äôt go to the mom because the mom hates them
I just thought of something maybe the reason why we don't see Daniel in the end is because Big Joe came and took him to the hospital
jack they didn't think their mom was dead, they knew she just left them, and that is why sean hates her and doesn't want to know nothing about her.
i‚Äôm pretty sure this is the only possible ending where finn doesn‚Äôt get shot and killed?

So is the game over
When will jack notice that Daniel sounds like Atreus from GoW? Maybe the voice actor for Daniel also did Atreus
HEY JACK DID YOU KNOW THATS THERS A ROUTE WERE SEAN USES THE GUN
You can borrow my Australian Shepard. He‚Äôs 12 but still acts like a puppy üê∂ üòÜ
I cant wait for life is strange to just become a superhero story and the next game is about the origins of Captain Planet who has to put a stop to supervillan daniel
Jack. Failing to comprehend the plot is like. Really frustrating. He won't see this ever, but. The reason Saun wants to go to Puerto Lobos is so they don't have to live as fugitives anymore. The reason he doesnn't want to go to the mom. Is because, as has been built up all of the game, he fucking hates her. He hates her and doesn't trust her. Because she ran away from them. Daniel's okay with that  because he wasn't old enough to even remember her. But Saun remembers. And he hates her for it.
I really hope Cassidy and Sean is okay. Daniel is really annoying in this episode.
Is it possible to pick Finn instead of Cassidy? Just curious
Wait wait what happens if the mom is Max‚Äôs from life is strange and maybe that‚Äôs how he got his power üßêü§Ø
i wanna beat finns ass so bad
Cmon Jack you like picked all the bad decision
After watching this again based on the choices that you already made, I would not be surprised if Daniel becomes too dangerous to be kept alive. Based off of the event back at the lake where he said " I am not a kid!" with bitter anger from his tonality and lifted a giant tree stump from the lake. Another event in this episode where Daniel is upset with Sean for spending time with Cassidey and tries to injure her with his gifted abilities. After that, he shouted, "I can do whatever I want!" and blasted the door wide open and blindly follows Finn because he gives Daniel the attention. If Daniel goes further down this path, he will most likely be going to get killed by the hands of someone who cares for him.


Other words, Daniel is most likely going to die if he continues this.
At a certain point I realized that I‚Äôm watching a grown man watch two teen kissing naked in a lake at night in a video game
The game isn't horrible or anything, but oof, these characters really make it hard to enjoy this. Finn started of very well, but he turns out to be an egoistical idiot. The other camp members beside him and Cassidy turned out to be filler, didn't really benefit the plot in any way. And Daniel reaaally lost some likeability-points - he's whiny, doesn't listen, abandons his family to hang with the cool new people, and while it makes sense for a little boy to behave like that, it baffles me that he didn't learn anything from the shit that's happened or at least his brother's shit-scared face - it's like they WANT to write him as a psychopath in the making. Recent games have shattered the stereotype of annoying child-/accompanying characters - TLOUs Ellie is a wonderfully interesting character, GOWs Atreus is (useful in combat and) a sweet boy who goes down a very dark path - but as he feels the consequences of his stupid choices, he goes through this great redemption-arc. In that finale Daniel had the potential to have been humbled by a bad consequence (Finn getting hurt) but then his brother, who's completely aware that Daniel's unpredictable and a ticking bomb, LETS HIM INTERFERE and makes everything worse.
At this point, if the repercussions of this final event don't give Daniel the humbling experience he desperately needs and fix their sibling-relationship (or he earns his redemption in the next episode), Daniel will go down as the most annoying kid in my experience with games. It's problematic writing when you actually want bad things to happen to your protagonists :/
You should hanging out with your brother because he are kid he can't be alone and he childish he can't think like adult
Also to be fair, although Daniel could have been fine with just hanging out with the group, I think it's the fact that no one is his age there and going from episode two, where they were together most of the time in a house while he had one friend, to living in a forest with a bunch of hippies that smoke and drink all the time that work at a weed farm. I would be angry too if I couldn't even do half the things the others were doing, let alone relate to them since he's the only kid that still likes cartoons and comics. Gotta remember he's a nine year old kid that thinks his mother is the answer.
You can borrow my dog Sean. XD
The kid is so dumb! ruined seans job, and getting him hurt! listen to your brother like omfg!
I think the conflict between Daniel and Sean is completely normal, I mean, Sean is a teenager and wants to have his life even if everything now is different, while Daniel wants his big brother to hang out with him and he also wants to be consedered an adult because of the new life style and his powers...but maybe as the player we should always remember that he's a kid. He can't take decisions of this kind by himself, because he will do stupid/dangerous things. I think that Sean should act differently towards him, the best thing maybe now is focusing only on Daniel. I know this sounds bad, he's still young, but he has to grow up and be the adult of the situation, I'm not saying he should act like a father but almost. It's for the safety of both, Daniel has to be more discipline and listen more to his brother, while Sean should keep between them a bond of trust and find a way to be listened by Daniel. I'm not saying that he's evil, but he could be very dangerous.
And I agree with Sean about the idea of showing more of the father, but maybe this sensation of not having a strong goal is almost intentional. I mean, when they were the fist time on the road just after the father's death, looking at them I felt lost. Even though they met people, they found a new job and they have an idea of what to do...they are still a bit lost. They don't know what will happen, they don't really know what they're doing and for me that's something a bit scary. At least that's what I think. 
And yes, they should definitely put something where they mute the music üòÇ
Okay, I'm done rambling everybody, if you read everything...wow, I admire you üòÇ
Look at this: They gonna make it to the Mexico, after so many ‚Äûadventures‚Äù and ‚Äûscars‚Äù, they make it, feel safe, but Sean know, Daniel become evil. They make it and now Police attack them, talking shit and at the end, Sean gonna need make decision, stop by police, or say Daniel to fight them, and if u choose something, Sean gonna find hi superpower and it doesnt matter what you pick before, Daniel gonna fight and destroy anyone and anything and at the same end you need to choose, fight Daniel for the city, for the world, or obey and atleast die in center of hell.
Sorry for medium english, its not my daily language. Of course its only my honest opinion about ending, and i really feel this game is targeting for this...
FUUUCCKKKK JACK DIDN'T MAKE THE SEANXFINN KISS HAPPEN
I think Daniel died because in the first look at episode 4 its only Sean walking maybe big Joe came and killed Daniel or he died from the gunshot
My gaydar is so strong that i can tell when game characters like the same sex, even if it is just a little bit.
Daniel is so annoying!  He‚Äôs a little brat who whines about everything!!
I hate the no music..
I hate daniel. He‚Äôs the problem.. acting all like an adult just because he got super powers
Is sean like 17? She look 20 something... I‚Äôm creeped out
Jack did you know they are making a Attack on titan 2
Wait the song titles are in the end credits? That means you can play the game with no copyright restrictions?
Is it just me or does Cassidy look older than Sean?
How many kids watched this with the sex scene and everything?
daniel is so annoying God
Sjjd if you would agree to steal the money then finn and Sean would have kissed
Finn... No. Shut up.
You can borrow my dog!
I‚Äôm serious, if there is a life or death option between Daniel and Cassidy, I would choose Cassidy, in an instant, hands down. I‚Äôm done with Daniel at this point. No normal kid acts like him. At least none that I know of.
I feel like Sean died and Daniel will be the main character but I‚Äôm praying that won‚Äôt happen
Help me........
I feel like Daniel and A.J. are similar, Sean tries his best not to make Daniel into a bad person when Daniel uses his power, and Clementine tries to make sure A.J. doesn't turn into a terrible killer when A.J. starts acting violent and starts hurting people.
Daniel bugs Sean to come hang out with him but when Sean tries to be with him and be a good big brother Daniel freaks out and goes on about not being a kid anymore I‚Äôm so confusssedeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddd
Man, Daniel like a dysfunctional spoiled brat. Any tips from parents out there how to avoid making your kids gone like this?
Can we just kill Daniel? He shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to exist at this point...useless and annoying character.
Wat
JACK THERE ARE 9 YEAR OLDS HERE
AM I THE ONLY THE ONE THE NOTICED THAT JACK POSTED EPISODE 3 PART 2 AND 3 BUT NO EPISODE 3 PART 1!
What am I watching... this is awkward...
I have 8 dogs so why not
I am starting to really dislike Daniel and his hot headedness....
DANIEL YOU FUCKHEAD
Ah
Sex is Strange 2
Jack: happily watching cassie and sean make out
Me: ok jack im in..
FBI: FBI OPEN UP
I hate Daniel
I'm 50/50 on Finn, but how do you get him to kiss you? It's probably something super obvious like be his friend, but I'd still like to know
I feel like there aren't many choices with Daniel. Like I wish there were options to talk him out of it or they use the power of brotherhood to take over the weed place and give everyone money or something...
How come you dont block out the nude scenes
Yeah you can  Borrow my dog
I don't think they just "add the power in to fufill the fanbase", I think they want to go on a different perspective with the power problem. In LIT 1 you have the power, you can control it and how are you gonna use it, but in LIT 2 you, the adult, still "kinda" have the power but you don't control it, it belongs to a 9 YEARS OLD kid, which is your little brother, which you, a TEEN BOY has to try and fill in the 'blank paper' in the little boy's mind, what he will do and how he will be in the future is entirely all your responsibility/faults.
In short, the only 'adult' who raise the 9 years old is the 17 years old teenager. Try to think in their shoes a little bit more. We are adult, we grow up with no power as the normal thing, but not the little one. He's only 9, his mind is still deciding "what's normal and what's not" in this world, that's why it's probably really hard for him to understand why he had to hide "a part of himself" to every other human being that he always thought as the same as him, and also he lost his parents, both of them are, at these age so it's kinda normal for the little one to be more impulsive than because his only family, the one taking care of him and show him the world is a confused teenager who had just got a better glimpse of the world but now can't even have time to live the life.

Sorry for the rambling above to whoever read this, I hope you can still get what I meant to convey, but I'm not actually confident in my English haha. Have a great day!
This is what happened when a spoiled little brat has superpowers
I know she is dead..




But I think Rachel is the mom 




I might do a theory video on my channel to explain it so yea
You know its not like Daniel and Sean are fugitives and Mexico is a different country where you can't be arrested by American police
Daniel gets cancelled
So looking back at the end choices (spoilers), either Finn died and Daniel would be upset and lash out with his powers, or Daniel would hate sean and use his powers regardless. Keeping that in mind, as bad as this played out, it looks like Jack picked the best ending by supporting his brother and his powers, all while saving both Finn (Daniels friend) and Cassidy (Sean's friend) and keeping everyone alive. I honestly believe this was the best ending we could have gotten (yes, I know how you feel about Finn but Daniel likes him so imagine how messed up or hurt Daniel would be if he died, he might have never forgiven Sean for letting him die).
I‚Äôm pissed because I feel like Danial is being a little bitchy brat that gets off easy
Cass is so annoying ffs
Wtffff that‚Äôs the end??!!!!!
Why is there less views?
I just realized that im so awkward  in front of girls that i get nervous when im watching a video game
Things I wish they did differently with Daniel:
- Apologize to Sean at least once, saying he understands he‚Äôs doing his best
- Have more conflicting morals on doing things that are violent
- Less anger, more fear. The way he acts is way too brave for a child, even with his powers
- Have Daniel promise sincerely to Sean that he won‚Äôt use his powers to hurt people, so that the ending of this episode is more impactful
Jack: ‚Äúdoes anybody have a dog that i could borrow ? For like a week.‚Äù
üòíjack just ask Felix if you could babysit maya and edgar lol
The dad never told Sean and Daniel that there mom was dead, she just left them out of nowhere and cut contact
Man... Daniel sucks.
you can borrow my dog jack
I think Daniel ran off to find the mum, he seemed pretty insistent on going before. Idk what Sean's going to do now :/
32:15                Awkward   100
jacob sucks
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true, but if you break a law in America, and go to Mexico, I‚Äôm pretty sure they can‚Äôt do anything, right? That might be why they‚Äôre going to Puerto Lobos, besides family.
sean you kept mentioning them just going to the mom but it‚Äôs not that easy. when a parent decides to abandon you when you need them, you don‚Äôt make yourself vulnerable again by running to them when you‚Äôre in trouble. you strengthen yourself by proving to them that you don‚Äôt need their help, you can figure it out yourself. the mom is basically a stranger to them, she may be blood but she isn‚Äôt family.
first life is strange: 1 kiss
second life is strange: full on sex lol
I would smack the living daylight out of Daniel! He has been so whiny I can't stand him. Not only that, he thinks he can do anything he wants since he has superpower. He even sent Sean flying a good few meters away for touching him when he's angry. Can't even count how many times he got Sean into trouble with his antics for defying Sean. At this point, I just sympathize with Sean that he needs to put up with this kind of a whiny ass of a little brother >____>  I understand his needs for attention but he's not doing his big brother any favor by going against him. Sean's been trying hard to protect him as a brother and dad at the same time. Daniel just won't listen to him at all. He's a spoiled brat. Period.
I get it that it's normal for kids to whine at times.
But constantly not listening to your brother & even to the point of hurting Cassidy proved so much that his age is not the issue.
A 9 year can already think,listen & learn to behave.
Daniel is just a SPOILED SELF CENTERED BRAT.
Dan is just a character that you can‚Äôt stop hating unless you kill them and since it‚Äôs this game they won‚Äôt kill him cause he‚Äôs a kid and therefore he is the  crappyest character ever
31:35 " You want me to come inside? " If this isn't a sexual innuendo i dunno what is hahahaha
Just wanted to say if you think Daniel is becoming an unrealistic depiction of a child or your starting to dislike him because he is becoming annoying. You havnt been around kids enough, all kids are annoying and bratty.
Hey I know it's not related to this game but what was that one game Jack played where there was some girl who had a really creepy teacher who was a photographer and he was famous? There was also that one girl who was sad and she jumped off the building for some reason. I swear it feels like that was life is strange but I can't remember
Jack, they‚Äôre Hispanic, and in this game puerto lobos is most likely a city or town in Mexico and the police can‚Äôt get them in Mexico cause it‚Äôs not they‚Äôre job anymore. Plus they have family on they‚Äôre dads side in puerto lobos. They‚Äôre just running until they don‚Äôt have to anymore
personally, i would‚Äôve loved a similar romance path to sean and cass‚Äôs romance but with finn. i know we can kiss him and choose to like boys, but that doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot compared to the straight option. again, it‚Äôs still amazing to have choices and options about sexuality in games-even asexuality-but you can clearly see that the way you‚Äôre supposed to play is by having a heterosexual relationship with cass. they make the only male option kinda shitty so that no one would really choose finn over cass, which sucks. again, love the representation, hate the way they decided to show it.
I can't be the only one whp really hates Daniel. I get that he's a kid but he's just way too cocky and stupid and always thinks he's right. Age doesn't matter because any character like that pisses me off.
Daniel sorta looks like Ben from Ben and ed but anywhoooüò≠üíó
30:20 WTF ? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD how much more sjw can this get ? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD consent ??? really ????
Yeah Daniel seems bratty but he‚Äôs 9 and also Sean is all he has. No more dad, Sean doesn‚Äôt wanna go to their mother so he kinda needs that attention. Esp since soon he was gonna be pulled from people again.
I kinda hate Daniel. I know he is a kid but he just doesn't seem to understand the danger they are in and keeps causing them to get into trouble. Even kids can understand these things (they shouldn't need to but they can) and he is just acting like a spoiled brat. I feel so bad for Sean, he is trying so hard to take care of them and Daniel refuses to think of anyone but himself.
My God LOL I love your vid‚Äôs and they‚Äôre really cool and I just want to be like you I always hoped that I will meet you but I can‚Äôt I hope that one day we will finally see each other actually that I will finally see you because I don‚Äôt even know if you care about it so I‚Äôm 11-year-old that just text you through YouTube for no reason just telling you that he likes you
*You are a Jedi,  Daniel."
Why is it that I find Daniel completely despicable? Perhaps I'm biased because I don't like little kids, but he's so obnoxious and selfish, and he doesn't listen or learn at all. He feels entitled to do whatever he wants because he's "not a kid anymore" and he so badly wants to be treated like an adult. And if I were Sean I would have given Daniel an earful, even before he went with Finn to steal the safe. Sean as a character is very meek and indecisive (ironic given this is a choice-based game) and he's just far too awkward - I feel like this game is filled to the brim with cliches as it is, but Sean is the person who utters the majority of them.
I am genuinely upset that there was nudity in this game, and left in this video... I love Life is Strange, and this completely ruined it for me... I don't care what other people will say about my comment. There was and is no need for the nudity.. it has nothing to with the story. And yes, I am an adult, not some 12 year old who is offended by this. I am a 24 year old woman who is offended by this. Jack, you could have at least done your part and censored it.. and Square Enix.. you should be ashamed of yourself... So much disappointment... üò≠üò≠ üíî
Kinda wish Sean went with the plan, a game‚Äôs for having funüòé
No one :
No one on this single earth:






Game: ENDS TO WERE WE HAVE TO WAIT 3 MONTHS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO CASSIDY AND SEAN
Hhhhhh the hate Daniel gets makes me so sad... Yeah he's an annoying kid but... he's 9 lmao a 9 year old isn't gonna be able to have the emotional maturity to handle these situations with ease so of course he's gonna lash out etc but that's the point - that's why Sean is there, to help guide him
I don't agree with your choices but ok
Sean and Cassidy make out


Jack, that‚Äôs so sweet!
I asked this like a million times and I'll ask it again Sean. Why don't YOU put a royalty free music on the muted scenes? It's really not that hard.
Jack you deserve a Grammy üòÑü§ô
Jack,you NEED to say "DAMN DANIEL" every time he does something big XD
YOU COULD'VE KISSED FINN! DAMMIT SEAN!! >:(
I love how one of the characters in the game named Sean, and the one who plays the game was named Sean as well. Lucky Lucky
I ship cassady and sean
The lake scene reminds of the pool scene from the 1st life of strange
get one from a shelter
I have 4 tabs open for my computer and they all have jacksepticeye in the title WTF
They creators made Daniel a shit show in this episode. Honestly Daniel has only done bad the whole series and he's just SOOOO whiny! His character had so much potential and they killed it. Great job developers
While I agree with Jack on his gripes about the story and powers etc., I believe that's kinda the point. This game is kinda more of a truer conflict. Daniel's power can do more, a ton more but telekinesis will never have as big of an impact as time travel ya know? And with them not giving you control over the power it kinda puts you in a desperate/dire need to lead daniel and protect him. It all falls together, just not in the happiest way. In my opinion alot of the gripes I have with this game still feel more realistic than the original Life Is Strange where nothing ends up mattering much because of the overpowered time mechanic. Still love both these games though, and R.I.P to the best Dad, Sen√µr Diaz! Since this is my first time mentioning it do to feels üòÇ
I hate how Daniel has become so bratty and tantrums when he doesn't get his way! He uses his powers to threaten and manipulate others bc he doesn't get what he wants or just doesn't like someone, and like Sean's trying to have his own life while also try and be there for Daniel but Daniel only thinks of himself! SPOILERS He even hurts everyone in the process by impulsively acting on stealing and was willingly going to kill Cassidy bc he was jealous Sean actually had a relationship! End of Spoilers Sean's only a kid as well so of course he's not going to know how to teach and parent a 9 year old boy and also try and have his own life and be his teenage self. I hope Daniel gets better and learns from his mistakes bc he's definitely become the most annoying and disliked character.
Sean ‚Äúyou want me to come inside‚Äù



Me and everyone else:  You
It's a little fuestrating when Daniel says "I'm not a kid anymore!" while he is ignoring the warnings of being fired. Daniel is correct in that he is learning many harsh lessons early on, but he expects great rewards for going through what he has and doesn't think about the consequinces. Hate to break it to ya Daniel, but my dad also died when I was a small human and he died protecting me, just like your's. No one gives a single thought to your situation and then thinks "Daniel deserves alot of chocolate, a pizza, some respect, etc.", the best Daniel is getting is a hug. Harsh lessons early on are tough, but when I was going through that, I still maneged to be nice to my older brother and I was on the road too, just in a car. I do not except this young age and hard problems stuff, people have delt with worse and were better about the situation.
I just realized, this is either child porn or a minor being ducked by an adult. No material how you look at it, it‚Äôs illegal especially if your an adult watch it.
Okay I think people really don't understand Daniels character. The dude is 9, lost his dad, has powers and is homeless and a fugitive. Yeah he's annoying and a brat. Like a lil brother SHOULD be. And no Sean doesn't hang out with Daniel all the time that's apparent through this entire episode. Daniels there but Sean never truly pays him any mind or interacts with him only scolding him or advising him yeah he's being a good brother but he's not hanging out with him, and no they don't train everyday Daniel has had to train himself and Finn is the only one that interacts with Daniel and genuinely enjoys his company which is WHY DANIEL IS SO ATTATCHED TO HIM ITS WHY HE CLINGS TO HIM AND NOT SEAN. Daniels actions can't be excused but every lil kid is selfish and has a I can do what I want attitude to some extent without any discipline. Add that to the fact he doesn't have a father and Sean not being a good role model boom you got bratty Daniel. Especially the choices Jack made makes it even worse, Sean isn't just a teenager anymore he's a caretaker as much as it sucks and the one decision that you are supposed to do the risky option to get the best ending. He doesn't do. Because Finns mentality was right which is what the developers wanted you to see that yeah your gonna need to take some risks and that Daniel is someone to be feared that's this whole episodes narrative. Daniel is going from a sweet kid to a cynical brat and that's not his fault. Also I'm talking about Jacks dialogue choices as well not just major choices.
Theory: Daniel and Sean‚Äôs mother is actually Max or maybe the other girl who‚Äôs name I can‚Äôt remember from the life is strange and she had to leave her kid in fear that her power was too dangerous for her children. So maybe we will see Max or the other girl who‚Äôs name I can‚Äôt remember again. Although for story purposes it makes more sense for it to be Max, the reason being  that the other girl would‚Äôve died because of the whole ‚Äúshot in bathroom‚Äù incident if you saved the town instead of her. So theory is that Max is their mother, ‚Äúbut her name is Karen!‚Äù BUT maybe she went through a similar incident and had to change her identity, another reason to have to leave her kids. It also would make sense seeing that She left AFTER Daniel was born. She saw it coming so she left them before anything could happen. It‚Äôs gotta be Max. Maybe I‚Äôm making this shit up but it all kinda connects. ESPECIALLY if you consider that Max could‚Äôve don‚Äôt in the future and seen this happen, so she left her kids to stay out of danger. Idk, guess we‚Äôll see ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Daniel I feel was very annoying to me in this episode! I know the whole point is for him not to listen but I swear.üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If Sean doesn't have powers I would be really disappointed
I love that country voice jack does, it always makes me LAUGH!
With everything that happens in this game... I can‚Äôt help but cringe or feel extremely awkward when I remember his age
Every time it gets tense I always wait for Sean to randomly whip out his hidden powers he doesn‚Äôt know about and I always get disappointed ü§•
51:50 just be John wick
Though it most likely wouldn‚Äôt change the ending, I would of spent more time with Daniel or at least balance out with hanging out with him or Cassidy (that‚Äôs her name right ?) but to be fair the choices you made did make the story interesting and a different view of what could happen. üëçüèº
31:31 what kind of category would you put that music with?
HANG OUT WITH DANIELL THAN HAIRCUTTTTT
I wish he got with Finn tbh.

Plus, I think it would have been cool to do the hiest. All it'd be is extra content
Game: (selling illegal marijuana) Jack: DONT LITTER!!!
lol my mom was in the room with me
ok but i feel like the voice acting is a little off? like some scenes feel so awkward idk
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED GIRL HOCK LINE AND SINKER
51:09 thanks for the brightburn spoilers
I like how Life is strange 1 & 2 have the like gay or straight choose like The walking dead season 4 and apex legends how glabiter is gay
Jacks face at 31:40 lol
Hey jack you can have one on my 4 dogs or 9 cats
F in the chat for Sean‚Äôs eye
41:59
I think Daniel just became the most unlikable character in the LiS universe for me.
As soon I saw the wolf tattoo I died out laughing
Game: Sex Scene without music
Jack: screams 






Edit: Oh my gosh, thanks for all the likes!!!
Ye really focked up now Sean! /s
Also, I agree, I feel like you made the decisions other Sean would have made.  You definitely pushed it toward a more interesting narrative.  Great content!
Daniel needs a little spanking üò† kid isn‚Äôt even of 2 digits and he thinks he‚Äôs an adult smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hated Daniel in this episode. 

I agree with what Jack mentioned at the end of the video about the game. They should‚Äôve included the dad more; episode 1 was too rushed.
R.I.P SEAN this new episode for daniel alone üòîüòîüòîüòî
Ummmm @jacksepticeye when stealing Big Joe's truck you could've tried the key to the yellow locker on the ground behind his car...
okay so.. we're just not gonna talk about the whole underarm situation? i mean razors are expensive i get it. just.. didn't expect that.
So my theory is that it‚Äôs the mother‚Äôs bloodline that holds the powers, and that Daniel is from a different mother than Sean, hence why Sean doesn‚Äôt have powers.
Thus explaining why Karen is so distant, and why Sean doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with her because his father warned him before to stay away from her (or something like that).
Damn these Clif hangers
Everyone: I hate Daniel he's so whiny >:((
Me: he's,, a confused 9 year old who lost his father, lost his friends, has powers, lost one of his friends BECAUSE of his powers, was being ignored by his older brother, and doesn't understand why they can't just find their mom and live with her, of fucking course he's whiny, the kid's been through hell and he's barely NINE
Edit: let's not forget it's KINDA his and his power's fault his dad died so :D
I got an ad right at 51:39
My sister walks in the room while im watching this and says my parents are fighting
I remember when I had sex it was the best time in my life
Betcha that person walking on the road for the teaser is Daniel just grown up.
damn
LiS2 without Music is terrible, i get you want to avoid Copyright issues but the game has great Songs in it, ESPECIALLY this Episode :(
Honestly, I'm going to be rubbing my eye all night after this episode. It's like watching someone on TV break a bone, and almost feeling their pain.  :P
‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre here to do some weeding, I‚Äôm so good at weed. Give me something to do‚Äù -GreenPewdiepie420 2019
jack plssssssssssssssssssss play mk11
YES THEY SHIPPED SEAN AND CASSADY (ngl tho that was super satisfying, loved it!)
A little wa poosh *sean trying not to say : TOP OF DEH MORNIN TO YEH!!
Most YouTubers: says the "f" word

YouTube: Demonized

Jack: shows Shows Cassidys cheeks and melons.

YouTube: oh thats fine
Jack: I feel like the power has a lot more it can do and it‚Äôs not coming into play
10 minuets ago: Blows up a house by using said power
You already MADE A PART ONE!?!?
Episode 3: We Were Allowed To Use Topless Models And We Had To Use Them As Much As Possible
wait kissing finn was an option, what a plot twist, can't see how that would've fitted into the game but ok
Aww you miss the kissing part for finn.
When you realized that the the bear was Pepsi fuuuuuuck it soooooo much
Sean is so Fit (Both or Sean's Daniels brother?)
"yeah, yeah it was cold.. but, i would be kinda careful myself if i were you, your nipples may end up cutting someone .. just saying.."
shouldve saved the game
30:37 So no head?
Ohhhhhhh my GODDDDDD DANIEL,,,,,
Damn jack needs to make a game like this! It seems like he‚Äôd better at making a game like this then the actual creators! He definitely thinks about it a lot more and would include much more stuff I reckon!
hey Nought/fred in the cut scene of prologue when they shows brads grave there was a women with black clothes and black hats was she Amanda
25:53  Ingrid can teleport now. She has her own powers.
Wow fire breaks out in a weed Factory and you call 911. That is the most bad idea ever. I'm sorry I didn't watch the entire way through I barely can watch five minutes of this cuz I have a whole lot of videos right now on my plate but still great video Sean.
Does anyone ever think that in the first game he is the reason the strom was there? (Or am i just like a flat earther?)
Jack's better at writing than professionals... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :/
I didn‚Äôt know Daniel actually tried to hurt Cass. 
What a brat. Talking about ‚ÄúFor weeks you just hang out with her!‚Äù
Sucka like you haven‚Äôt been hanging with Finn for weeks on end??
Impossible üôÑ
It felt like everything was over dramatised just for dramas sake
This episode is full of drama like my gosh can't we have a happy scene?
....man I'm glad I stuck with this...this episode was fantastic!
jack finn has the same earringd
This cliffhanger will keep me tense for a while
My thoughts, in a super long post:
I don't like how everyone hates Daniel this episode. He's being the 9 year old that's out on the road/on the run with his big brother, the only constant in his life. Daniel misses everything from his old life, and he's angry. And him and Sean don't talk about emotional control of Daniel's powers, at least not naturally. You have to go to bed with Daniel and be like "why are you so mad?" instead of, for example, going up to Daniel while he's practicing on the lake and have the conversation, or even when Sean and Daniel are training together there was nothing for emotional control. He has complete control of his power when he is not in an emotional state, but as soon as something big happens, Daniel looses it. 

And yes, Sean and Daniel had the same group of people around them, but it looked like Finn was the only one that treated him the same way when it's just them and when they're around the others. Everyone else probably treated him like a kid or something. And yes, my point is that he's a kid, but he has a lot of responsibility now and they have to be on the down-low. I have an older brother too and wanted to hang out with him and his friends when we were little, but it's never the same.They would always act differently when I was around vs. when they were alone, and that's probably how it was with Sean and Daniel. There are no kids Daniel's age with this new group of people and Daniel just wanted to hang out with Sean, his constant.
Or, Daniel's probably just starting puberty, and has a lot of hormones going on.

I also don't like how you choose your romance options? Like, if you want to romance Finn you have stay and get a haircut and then say yes to the heist, and even then, it's not as much as you get with Cass. I just wish the romance options would be more natural.
I also have mixed feelings about Sean's haircut, but it's just hair.
I do like though, that depending on your different choices, the dialog changes slightly. That was a nice surprise.
I appreciate that the brothers are butting heads more. They've stuck at the hip, out on the road for how long now? If my brother and I hung out all day for a day, or a whole weekend, I get sick of him by the end of day one xD
Why does Daniel give off a BrightBurn vibe
17:05
OOF
31:34 Oh God why
You either die a hero, or live long enough to become a villain. At this point, which way is Daniel going?
well time to go back into hibernation while waiting for episode 4 till August
No jack you will not take ma doge hides in corner with dog and a knife
Sean is literally the best brother out there. He left everything behind and does whatever it takes to be the best role model and morally correct character for Daniel to take influence from. Man, Daniel sucks
4 NOW
I love how there is actual consequences in this episode , other than the first episode, when they ran away from home, they were just walking around.
Here you go jack here's cookie you can borrow him for a we-- never mind
Its 9 Pm and I have to wake up at 5:30 thank you so much for this episode Jack and my crippling sleep deprivation.
Jack what‚Äôs with the new look
Jack, don‚Äôt mention borrowing dogs! You don‚Äôt want another incident like the graphite!
30:04 Papa Sean to little Sean: 'Smooth~' 
33:22 Also Papa Sean: 'This is even more awkward without music...' (sings) 'Lets get it ooooooooon~ Aaaaaaaaaw YEAH!'
Glorious moments.
Jack, you had the option to FORCE THE TRUCK DOOR OPEN !!!!!!
swimming in both life is strange games üòéüòé
Some of these conflicts seem very manufactured. I expected almost everything to happen the way it did, but I wouldn't know about making a story so
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Jack could direct a game. Seriously, he would do a great job.
0:05 I thought your cup said c*nt
theres some nudity in this episode ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I am mad now what were they have to do that to Shawn Charlene you're not mad that happened to you Sean Sean come on I know you mad come on JK
The beat part about this is now I know what NOT to choose when I play hahaha.
Man Daniel gets on my nerves
The mother never died. She left them
Ooooof
Ummmmmmm Square Enix did you just copy jacksepticeye? Same name, similar hair , a single tattoo, Septic eye??!!!!! Is this the orgins of Jacky boy? Sean what aren't you telling us?
Hes 18 or did he just have sex under age
They don't know where there mother lives (it was a PO box address) and Sean hates her because she ran out on them when they were younger, they didn't think she was dead, the game never said she was dead. The very beginning Sean even makes comments about how his Dad should get rid of her bike etc. He hates her for bailing on them and the game reminds you every episode so I don't get why you think Sean should just go to her and would be happy to know she "exists". The whole second episode he didn't want Daniel going in her room because she bailed on them.
When is the complete Game of Life Is Strange 2 is coming out for PS4 ? I don't like to download video games üòí
Jack, I think that the episode was decent. Maybe it is a good thing that you can't read where they are going with the episode. That way they could surprise you with something interesting on the story that you do not expect. In that sense, it is better than something good that you can know what happens ahead of time.
Finn stop talking!!!!! Technically they never committed a crime in the first place, they just want to know what happened, stealing money from someone, now that‚Äôs a crime and they could do worse if they got caught, Merrill and big joe are armed and they can kill anyone they are off the grid
0:06- "...I got my coffee." Not a bad idea. I might need some tonight. Making up for lost time, and this is 1/3 videos tonight and a long on.
0:48- "Seems kind of silly that no one would wake me up." Maybe you couldn't be woken. Some people are deep sleepers. Me on the other hand is a light sleeper. (groans)
- This is not going to end well. Daniel is a loaded gun, and no one except Sean knows it.
- "He seems like he just gets in trouble anyway." Maybe, but in a different way? This is not a true branching story-line. It only branches a little.
- "Tattoos are not that bad." Well, you would know. That is one thing that I won't ever do. Thought about it, but decided instead on matching anklets instead of ink.
- "That would be freezing!" Yeah, it can be. I remember swimming at Swallow Falls State Park in MD once in May with my college friends before going home for the summer. The falls still had a bit of ice around the rocks in places. It felt like wading into pain. Still did it, because I'm nuts like that. 19 years later, I can still remember. :D
- "Other people's dreams are not your responsibility." True. That is up to them. But if I can help, I will. Just who I learned to be after being angry for so long. The first quote in my collection is, 'Be the angel you hope to meet.' The quotes help, so does the journaling and art. And I guess stuff like this. I get to write to my pen pal, and you get something (hopefully) interesting to read.
- "Do we have to sit here and watch this whole thing play out?" You do, I have a way of skipping. This is private... X(
- "Does anyone have a dog that I could borrow?" There is Millie, aka 'work dog' who keeps me company while I work with data and make maps. She is a little shy, but I bet would like you fine. Millie is a Rhodesian Ridgeback.
- "I think I made a supervillian." :O Looks like a tornado. A psychic storm fueled by emotions.
- "Aww man!" I agree. We don't know who is dead, and who is just unconscious. Nasty ending. Now we have to wait 3ish months to find out what happens. :(
- "I am very curious to see what you guys think." Well, there it all is. (points at 'long comment') :)
You know, it might be there is a lack of atmosphere due to the music issues, but I don't really like this nearly as much as the other Life is Strange Games. I'll probably go back and play it on my own at some point to reevaluate, but right now, I either hope that the ending is Daniel going full Supervillain and killing Sean(assuming he only lost the eye and didn't completely die) or Max showing up and time reversing back to the first episode, stopping Daniel from ever learning he has powers.
I thought that Daniel would deflect the bullet into Merril.
Please update your House Flipper series with the new Garden Flipper DLC! <3
Discuss is on the shotgun if you didn't notice.

48:52
Pls do antisepticeye again
48:39 
Sean peed himself lol
I think Daniel only does that to Cassidy if you let him kill the mountain lion that was wild!
Skinny dipping scene... Cool.
29:29 Jack got priority and that facial expression is the best. Plus no music sex is the best to see his reaction.
mom im scared
I wonder if this game will turn into Chronicle
Does he not realize that they never thought the mom was dead?
I hope Sean have Force too.
I'm starting to think that white guy with the beard was working for the police. Maybe he'll save Daniel and or Sean.
There are many awkwards
12 year olds that watch were probably telling their parents said it was just a video game no need to worry
Why don‚Äôt you blur for the kids
Baby baby baby BOOOOOY
does anybody not actually like Daniel or am i the only one?? Right from the start he's been a pain in the backside and he seems to only be getting worse and more cocky and annoying as his powers grow
Honestly, I‚Äôm not a big fan of Daniel right now. And it‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt like kids (cuz I don‚Äôt) but Daniel is smarter than he lets on and he understands what‚Äôs right from wrong. He‚Äôs becoming such a brat and he‚Äôs on some stupid power trip like how Atreus was after he found out he was a God. He‚Äôs become more of a threat than anything and I‚Äôm seriously worried for everyone‚Äôs (especially Sean‚Äôs) safety. :(
Daniel is deadass annoying, as a younger sibling myself, i hardly see my sister cause she's always at work or when she did have a boyfriend she wasn't home, did i whine and complain??? no, like sure it sucks that ur sibling isn't there for you but Daniel really felt like the shit just cause he had powers, if he didn't have powers, he wouldn't have acted the way he did throughout this entire episode, i swear this series better get a good ending like the first life is strange
Okay, it can't just be me that is slowly hating Daniel's character development. The episode just made him seem more whiny and he complained a lot more about the way he's treated that it's sort of becoming unrealistic and irritating. Ngl, if I was Sean, I would've left Daniel at this point if there was an option, even if it isn't the most ideal situation. The stuff that's happening in the episodes is also kind of getting repetitive and it could've all played out a little better than it did. No hate tho, the game is still really good so yeah.

Edit: yeah sry I understand the point that he is just a kid and leaving him may not be the best option. I guess my thought process was leave him for a bit in the sense that he wants to be an adult. The way they portray him in the game is slowly making him that way. It's giving a reason to either give him attention or give him space. I was aiming more for giving him space.
jack yeh but i do ask do i have your word you will feed her even him i have 2 you can choose the male is the cutest ok
part 1 boring

part 2 holy SH
15:30 THAT HAS TO BE N-E-U-R-O-F-U-N-K!
Sean's superpower is surviving Daniel's explosions
42:14 why would u choose "break window" instead "force open"
I have a dog you can still I named him Ben Shapiro
Well that was a ending
I'm watching this in the middle of the series
I like the vid, love the game but honestly Jack you should‚Äôve gone the Finn route instead of the Cassidy route... I‚Äôm just saying.
It's not the same without the music
I wonder why Daniel didn't just like snap Merrill's neck or something instead of just lobbing his shotgun
Sean and Daniel knew that their mom was alive. The whole reason why they aren‚Äôt going to Arizona to see her is because Sean is angry at her for leaving.
Do u like pugs
When your parents are so strict and you say frick

EYES GLOW RED BOI!
Honestly the people who dislike can just go drink PepsiüòÇ

Theory |
Sean goes off alone leaving his friends behind looking for Daniel, Big Joe might‚Äôve called the cops because he had another car, or maybe he walked it and saw the whole thing going on. While Sean was knocked out a tracker might‚Äôve been placed on him to follow and listen. Officers soon place cameras in every direction, including snipers. 
They capture him and throw him into jail, calling his mom/mum. Sean finally meets his mother and she explains Daniels power (She surely has something to do with it.) making a new and exciting adventure.

But that‚Äôs just a theory, a ‚ÄòLife Is Strange 2‚Äô theory.
Does anyone else think finn looks like lil pump? Lol
Hey, jack I wanted to know what your opinion would be on a good gaming chair for me, I believe I am about the same height, weight, and size as you and just wanted to know because I haven‚Äôt been able to decide.
I unsubscribed just because you put the Lords name in a cursed word sorry
This whole series should be called ‚ÄúJack makes bad decisions‚Äù
Ugh I can't wait until August üòñüò≠
i  had minecraft in the background while watching this video so that whenever the music cut out in the game, i had minecraft music to accompany me. happy 10 years:)
August 22nd...I CANT WAIT THAT LONG
Jack the skull that‚Äôs you see in big joes place is an Easter egg to the skulls from walking dead the final season
its cute how at the beginning where everyone is chanting sean it shows cassidy as the one saying it
Cassidy & Sean have the same face as I notice now @-@ lmao I couldn't stop thinking bout it
Finally jack!I have been waiting for months for this
Now does he got a power like Cyclops from X-man
He's 16
stranger things all over again
Anyone else cringe at the arm joke
1:09:52 Steve Hoe's
Daniel is the kid from Brightburn.
Come on Daniel.
One of the things I am noticing for sure is that Daniel is letting the powers go to his head. Making him think he is above everything and everyone. Person he doesn't like, hurt em. Something he wants, take it. Need to defend himself, do it. And the worst part is that because of the powers, he thinks he's above the adults, above the cops and worst off, above his brother. Even to the point that in one of the endings, not only does he disobey Sean, but he even willingly hurts him.

Daniel is being forced to grow up fast and cope with the situation he's in. But the way he is doing so and how he is treating others is exactly what a kid would do. Except as I said before, this kid has the power to change things. That in and of itself is the scariest thing to think about.
I have a Puggle named Bentley. He‚Äôs a lazy boy and loves to cuddle.
I think Sean is dead, just saying, he did get glass in his eye.
No they are not brother or sister on 13:28
I wanted jack to steal from Merrill.who else
33:50 I was literally thinking the same thing and then you said it LMAO
Jacob is literally me.
Wait is Sean gonna become Deathstroke or something?
plz turn on the music Jack,its so awkward
Jack u legit need to shave
Don't worry Jack, I was thinking a lot of sex jokes too after the tent scene.
Finn is giving me bad vibes
daniel took the money and left.
Do more right when episode 4 comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
see y‚Äôall in 6 months
I wanna sympathize with Daniel, but his constant and unnecessary whining attitude is making it very hard. He's a little too clingy. And he should know to only ever listen to what his brother says and not some pothead. I know they lost their dad and old lives, but Sean is still technically a kid too. He can't and doesn't want to be 100% around Daniel all the time. I would know, I have a little brother.
Wouldn‚Äôt the dog get really frickin high in the farm
Can‚Äôt wait for episode 4 when Jack continues to believe that the mom was dead and the letter revealed her to be alive.
i hate that there‚Äôs no music bc it makes everything so much better
So awkward without music
So Daniel couldn't have just paralyzed Merrill like he did Cassidy, to avoid both Finn dying and prevent all the other people from getting injured? When has a simple guy with a gun ever been a threat to someone with telekinetic powers?

Honestly, the writers for these games deliberately always go for the least possible scenario just for the sake of creating the feeling of a cringy drama series, and completely avoiding the superpower aspect, which they obviously only put inside the game because they felt obliged to. They should honestly do a little less "Life" and a little more "Strange".
ITS. SO. QUIET. I. AM. UNCOMFORTABLE. 

üòÇ
Wait so how old is Cassidy? I assumed she was in her early-mid twenties while sean is 16
What if the mom is max from the first game and that‚Äôs why Daniel has powers
Jack: "I've done that outro so many times there is no way I could mess it up."
Also Jack: 1:11:24
Thanks for coming 
But we didn‚Äôt come together
love how Jack is questioning why he's going to Puerto Lobos even though he's the one that literally picked the option to go there
No ads? THATS CRAZY!!
The next one comes out in August 22nd and the next one is December 2nd 3rd or 4th maybe the 2nd
We have got to play as Daniel in Episode 4
we need more life is strange 2
ummmm..... NOOOOOOOO!
Guess you could say that Sean had a septic eye at the end
33:20 when i got up to this since there was no music, I played careless whisper by George Michel to make less awkward
I miss roger
It reminds me of when that guy off walking Dead the governor gets stabbed in the eye with a piece of glass
Rip sean
Is it just me, or did Jack start swearing more after YouTube started demonetizing people? He's just like, 'Ha you can't mess with me, I have the power of god and anime on my side!'
All daniel had to do was do what he did to the puma to merril and big joe
We got a new puppy two days ago and her name is Bella and she‚Äôs seven weeks old and she‚Äôs a pit bull, rottweiler and boxer mix and she learned very fast that flowers don‚Äôt taste good, even if they‚Äôre purple.
I kinda blame Karen (the mom) if she didn't leave the dad wouldn't be dead, Sean would have been hurt or a jerk to his brother (sorry Jack) and Daniel wouldn't have known his power or at least found out later in his year like Max did, but Max and Daniel's power happened from a death they seen. But I still blame the mom
From what I understood, from that 30 second trailer, that one of the boys is dead.  Could Sean be dead and Daniel is on his own?  Did Daniel kill his dad and his brother?  I am confused now.
I feel how Daniel feels, I have an older brother which hung out with me alot and soon he was hanging with friends and I felt left out and alone, so he needs to see its just life and maybe thats how he can control himself but he wants life perfect but hes too young to know that is not as real as he wants.
dear god i used to be okay with Daniel as a character but now i just hate him so much-- i don't care if he's a kid, he's super annoying and dumb ug h
Now I have to wait 3 more months for the next episode... üò≠üò≠üò†
GG 22 mil

Also Jack your epic
WHEN DID HE CUT HIS HAIR?? HAHAHAHAHAHA
you guys remember captain spirit?  bruh i was so happy when i saw sean and dan at the end
I paused the the vid I think  finn is going to sneak out with dan and get the money
Bru can we call sean carol
WTF happened to the sound?
sean kisses cassidy finn hey cass... next clip sean has a second black eye
Daniel is going to make a tornado like the old life is strange then max is going to have to stop him she‚Äôs the mother
Welcome to Life is Strange 2! I got my cuntfee coffee.
Just my guess
There going to Porto Lobos to see there mom
Predictions for next episodes (read after you‚Äôve seen this ep): 

Merrill‚Äôs not dead, but he‚Äôs not gonna rat Daniel to the cops for theft cause hell rat himself out for working on a pot farm. 

Depending on whether or not you went with Finn‚Äôs plan ‚Äî or you got fin killed or not, Finn or Cassidy with offer to go with Sean to find Daniel and Sean will be so fed up he‚Äôll be like ‚Äòno I have to go find him myself‚Äô and he says his goodbyes to the group quickly. It‚Äôll be sad but a ‚Äúalright we have to find my brother, now‚Äù

the ‚Äúunknown officer‚Äù is talking to Daniel saying he‚Äôs all alone. Maybe he got caught with the money doing some dumb shit like buying tons of shit all at once since he seemed to have just grabbed it and ran. it would be super suspicious to see a nine year old come into your store with a boatload of cash. (He was shot in the shoulder so this could possibly hinder the use of his power with him being right hand dominate. And that‚Äôs why he was caught so easily. Although if your game didn‚Äôt have him get shot I don‚Äôt know how he would get caught with the use of his powers.)

Sean is the one walking down the road (it just seems his hood is up and his sleeves are torn off.) I don‚Äôt know why he would be walking so slow though if he were trying to look for his brother. He could be dehydrated although his body movement to me suggests  he‚Äôs just ready to give up. So this may be  after Daniel ran. 

The mother probably has powers and that‚Äôs why she left home. (I‚Äôm sticking with this prediction since we haven‚Äôt gotten any other reason for her to leave. Not even a ‚Äòshe was unhappy with her marriage‚Äô or ‚Äòshe wanted a fresh start‚Äô)

Somehow Daniel and Sean reunite and ditch the plan to Puerto Lobos to look for their mom. They‚Äôll use the PO address as a start because she must have to live nearby, right? She‚Äôs most likely going by a different name in her new town so asking around for ‚ÄòKaren‚Äô probably won‚Äôt help even if it‚Äôs a small town, unless someone knows a women who moved there about eight years ago. Anyway, it‚Äôll probably be a scavenger hunt to find her. 

I don‚Äôt know if any of my predictions are even close, but I feel the game is gonna end with such a climactic twist and I‚Äôm honestly so fucking hyped for it.
Don't do it
i have a theory that Rachel from life is strange before the storm have the same power that daniel have but didn‚Äôt have a strong shock to trigger it anyway i guess it‚Äôs stupid but what you think of it ?
Why is he starting to speak like a black guy?
Jack, what in the world did you think would happen if you chose for Daniel to use his powers? Like, Finn is on the ground, 'cause he made an awful choice, and he is about to be punished for something he did, that you greatly advised against for being too dangerous, and then all of sudden, you're just like "I wanna see Daniel do the cool power stuff" even though that choice had literally nothing else appealing to it, and then, unsurprisingly, Daniel ends up with a bullet in his shoulder, and you're all passed out on the floor of a trashed house, and Sean has a chunk of glass digging into his eye socket. I hate to say it, but that was by far the worst choice you've made so far. But whatever, you play the game how you want to I suppose
Me, low-key hoping Cassidy is dead: oh... what a shame... damn... rip...
Hears Jack say he wants music in the background

Starts blasting Yankee Doodle
1% of comments: good vid

99%: gReAt CoMmENt
Sean‚Äôs hair cut is so cool like shit Finn is so good at cutting hair üëåüòÇüíï
33:49 that's so fucking relatable üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ it has happened to me so many times lmao. Love the vid and the good job!‚ù§
Is anyone else's heart racing at 51 minutes?
i feel like daniel inherited is powers from his mother idk
It's odd not watching his vids in like 3 years and to find out he has a beard
Why would you make Daniel abuse his power?
imagine if sean said "i think you should know um... i have crabs"
I wonder if The Wolf Among Us 2 will ever come out or even made.
I don‚Äôt like Cassidy :/
Use your music
Now I‚Äôm just waiting for Sean to say to someone top of the morning to you
My dog was already stolen
DAMN DANIEL
Did finn get all the money and sean get shot on the eye really
EYE PATCH EYE PATCH EYE PATCH EYE PATCH!!! 
Edit: Sean hurt one eye, It's Jack septiceye?
Jack: are any of you legal american drinking age?
Me: is it legal to work at a weed farm?
Oh man what going to happened in the next ep ???
For some reason I feel like Sean has power too idk why
I would say all the characters you met meet at the end all step In and gang up it'll be a cool moment like team against cops not fighting they would protect him
Tnis is the cringyiest episode everüòÇüòÇüòÇ
One gripe that i really had with this episode ,and the series in general, is the lack of facial animation. It feels like the characters emote through wildly shaking their heads.
i aint happy, I'm feelin glad i got sunshine, in a bag...
God, daniel almost killed everyone. Sean must have a power that reflects daniels destructive power. Like a yin and yang where only the other power can calm the power
do u think Jack doesn't realize that Finn is kinda gay for Sean
I wish Sean had powers
I would say they will have to meet with Chloe from number one because Arcadia bay is rip so she is alive and that's was a big thing at the start so yeahh
Sean. You did not blur out the nudity. Come on.
I have 3 dods
Daniel would have probably swiped the gun anyway but by you telling him to, he won't get into the habit of defying Sean in those situations. Daniel did seem bratty in the episode, wanting all attention, using the fact that Sean hangs out with them more against him when they fight. I loved it over all and I hate that I have to wait till the next episode.
I have a pug you can borrow
The mum left them, jack, she didn't die, SHE LEFT THEM
Jack, can you do an american accent? if so please do one in your next vid.
Sean: does a great job at work


Daniel: I'm about to end this man's whole Career
"Are any of you of legal drinking age"
Says to the guys smoking and harvesting pot
Jack has a lot of really good ideas during his rant at the end, if only he could write for the game
16:25 i think you forgot your hair bro.
it's like finn saw what Daniel could do and was like bam i'm gonna get paid, and also where the hell did Daniel go
I really miss the music in the background I understand why, but it kinda takes away the vibes from this game.
Why do you even care about Finn is beyond me
I'm really nervous for this game cus episode 1 was really great but since then the last two just feel like standalone games that could honestly just be cut out because they all have time jumps. Nothing here really feels significant and now there's only two episodes left and so honestly we only have one episode for them to get their plot together. I want the game to do well because the first season was incredible. The thing is, this episode felt like extremely boring filler and then we get 10 really good minutes at the end. It's kinda frustrating cus we have to wait like 4-5 months before we get another decent 10 minutes. I'm not that excited since I'm kinda giving up hope for it at this point, but let's hope they can do this amazing concept some justice!
Oof. A tween + super powers =/= a good time
When the question of ‚Äúwhy are they still going to Mexico and not trying to find their mother‚Äù came up, I thought ‚Äúyeah, I was thinking the same thing. That will probably happen before this game‚Äôs over.

When the question of ‚Äúare any of them legal American drinking age‚Äù, probably not but they‚Äôre working on an illegal pot farm so why not.

I‚Äôm guessing Daniel attacking Cassidy only happens if you let Daniel kill the cougar. I didn‚Äôt let him kill the cougar and he didn‚Äôt attack Cassidy, he only blamed her before turning to blow the door open. I think in some people‚Äôs playthrough‚Äôs I watched, if they let Daniel kill the cougar, then Daniel would attack Cassidy.
Jack I love you but God please think about it. The mom would be a place the cops would go to first considering a runaway would go to people they know first. (The grandparents are a good example) The place down in Mexico would be a good hiding place, considering the father already owns it and the police wouldn't suspect the kids to go from seattle all the way to Mexico.
Big Joe=Kratos
I‚Äôve got a few Rhodesian ridge back you could borrow one off lol ....
Jack if you pick your into girls when you and cassidy are swimming in the lake you have an option to kiss her and get on her tent
Why didn‚Äôt you make him kiss Finn?

HE‚ÄôS SUPPOSED TO KISS FINN
"Other people's dreams are not ur responsibility" best quote i've heard lately
Tbh, I already disliked Daniel from the start on. And but this  episode so far just makes me dislike him even more.
From that Ep 4 preview, I'm calling an episode segment within a jail, and a huge jail break with Daniel's powers, perhaps with the help of Ep 3 dudes, with the tough decisions being who breaks out with you.
All I could tgink when they we're in that lake was Jason
Ugh I didn't know how much i needed this until one didn't come out yesterday...this series is like taking hard drugs.
Edit: I was a bit disappointed with a lot of your choices this time, dude. I wanted you to spend more time with Daniel since he seemed like he needed a big brother to help him out.


THREE MONTHS IS TOO LOOOOOOOONG.
ALL THE WAYS FOR SONGS
33:51 that's exactly what's happening




Minus the tv and instead a phone and ear buds
u can baroww my dog

sorry i dont think i spelled that right
25:56 " Scooting around at the speed of sound"
Aw, Dontnod‚Äôs trying to be old BioWare, that‚Äôs adorable!
Jokes aside, it‚Äôs nice to see a game dev have some balls nowadays. 
CD Projekt did it better though, because they‚Äôre like the best dudes ever.
mom was never dead bro
(Spoiler question) 






What decision makes Daniel use his powers on Cassidy?? This is the first gameplay I‚Äôve seen that happen.
Maybe if the damn kid just watched Mob Psycho hed be fine
i like the real life details LIS puts in their games :)
37:41 you and me both HAHAA
2:50 That‚Äôll be GrYeT
Uh oh, think we got a demonetization here
im swedish and they sound hella swedish
What if Daniel goes rogue at the end of the season causing mayhem to the world and max and chloe return( depending on your decision) and the team up with shawn to stop Daniel.
34:49 I just got a puppy and she is a Boston terror mixed pit bull. But I'm here in CA lol.
üî¥ MILD SPOILER ALERT üî¥




I was thinking when Sean said ‚Äú***k me!‚Äù When they were running to find those two, (I won‚Äôt spoil it) I thought Cassidy was gonna say ‚ÄúI just did‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ
Jack- "This is even more awkward with no music!"
Proceeds to sing "let's get it on" really badly
Tbh Daniel is too whiny and I think it‚Äôs beyond the point of me caring for his character like I did at the start now I‚Äôm just feeling bad for Sean
That sex scene, I cringed so hard.. awkward silence.. starring into jack's eyes with awkwardness.... Humming loudly
I like how Penny just glitches out a little bit here 25:03
Jack can't count to 3...
Long time no see jack
I will get that exact tattoo.
Why Daniel always get in to trouble Sean get trouble to
When Jack made jokes about them having sex, I remember when Sean said: "Do you want me to come inside?
I thought the water was toxic though
Amazing
Jack as i followed , Daniel made a crime by killing a cop , and then they had to run to Puerto Lobos (mexico im pretty sure) so they are not a refugee anymore because in other country ,their crime doesnt count. And their mom is in the country theyre living in right now so.. they have a house in mexico.
The Diaz brothers: Mexican
Jack: I think I made a super villain
Trump: WhAnTs tO bUiLd wAlL
I think there mom is max with a changed name and she left because she didn't what to put thm at risk


But I dont know how long after life is strange 1 this is so maybe not : /
Could daniel cause the giant tornado from LIS 1?
@jacksepticeye tell ur editor to add music to the no music sound
If it makes you feel any better, I skipped swimming and going in her tent, and everything still went to shite basically the same way
Why would they apply copyright to music in their game? they paid for the rights, they have control over that, sounds like a douche move to me, nothing new from them but you know
i feel like cassidy shouldve been a mother figure since they grew up without a mom, it would be a great story arch
For a second i thought he was gonna rob the safe, he was like "i dunno man... Were already in trouble as is"  i was about to go off on him lol, he already made all the morally wrong choicesüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I thought Jack would just start playing the Megalovania at the background
Both of these vids are going to get demonetized
Jack the man who will question about their drinking age but will say nothing about all the pot
What if daniel goes back in time and makes the tornado from the first game.
33:02 "I think you should know that i'm.. BATMAN!" wish Sean would would have said that
31:36*lenny face intensify*
I have 3 dogos lol
PART 3 please Sean
The next episode comes out around August! NOOOOO!!!!!!!!
No matter what path you chose the ending was still the same in the end of it all
Bad hair and bad tattoo
I think that they're taking a different route with doing  powers since in the first game, it was so power filled and only about the powers.. I like the game a lot so far personally and think its better than the first one.
31:35 "YOU WANT ME TO COME INSIDE"
I took this way too sexual lol
You can have my dog his name is baby we named him that cuz he whines all the time
You've consecutively made some of the worse decisions yet in this episode. I wonder how many sexual diseases Sean contracted from his firsty.
"Other people's dreams are not your responsibility."
Honestly probably one of the best quotes I've ever heard


EDIT: Since this seems to be getting some attention, I want to put a little PSA out there..
EVERYONE has the right to follow their dreams. No matter if a friend or family member or stranger puts you down -- whether you're in middle school or already have your own family --  It's your responsibility to put forth the work and effort to make it. Whatever you're going for, I'm rooting for you!
4:42 
Anders: does ok sign
Sean: what's that mean
Merrill:okay!
Me: perfect timing
I feel like there‚Äôs a major plot twist in ep 4 just like season 1 when they reveal Mr. Jefferson.
I am proud that I managed to do this bit without alerting Big Joe XD
Idea Sean died and the rest of the game is as Daniel trying to find his mom probably not though
I think Daniel can be the shocker now
Sean you did a bad job with censors
what happened to your hair
You can have my dog
Anyone else here hates Daniel for never listening?
What are those things they are wearing on they‚Äôre necks
I think Daniel will go to his mums, I also wonder if we will see Lyla again.. I imagine with Daniel being awol she would be too concerned to sit still at home.
Sean: They don't sound swedish

The swedes: literally talked swedish last episode
i have a little brother too so i knew daniel would trust someone else instead of sean and i knew he would be destructive and wouldnt obey, it was pretty obvious after he "hit" sean
I have a feeling Sean will not get a power and in the end I believe he Will die bc what will counter and evil Telechanetic basically I feel Sean will die then Daniel will see what he did wrong and continue to do bad or something
is it just me or is cassidy and sean's romance really awkward and forced
I was wondering if that was a satanic symbol on Sean's arm
Man I hate kids
I think Jack didn't notice that Sean and Finn could kiss!
I AM SO GLAD YOU DIDN'T LET FINN DIE, HE'S MY BABY.
Merrill: I have a gun.

Daniel: I‚Äôm about to ruin this mans career
is it weird that while watching life is strange 2 in which the characters are trying to go to Mexico I get an ad about going to Mexico?
daniel went darth vadar on her 46:19
Who was cringed out and kinda played carless whisper in their heads when cassidy and sean we doin fun adult times
Yeah decisions don't always affect the ending of the particular episode but they do affect characters, their behavior and future episodes
Seriously Merill? You were just praising them and then you scold him? 0_o
Was Cass missing an arm??
dang it he did not put the cool music over it
cant watch omg my sweet eyes
Why didn't he pry the door open to the truck 42:20
Jack and I had the same expression when Cassidy kissed Sean. And when the sex scene happened I had in my mind Sweet Sweet Victory playing. Lol
What are those things they are wearing on they‚Äôre necks
So cringe without music
im in the comments
.....Cassidy.....my gay heart cant handle it
What are those things they are wearing on they‚Äôre necks?
Hello S√©an! Im graduating tomorrow and just thought I‚Äôd say you were and still are a huge inspiration to me and your content helped me through my senior year! You‚Äôre even cool enough to be my senior quote for the yearbook! Keeping doing you and no pressure but please keep making fun content for your fans! üòä
Calling it now towards the end he'll be the villan about to destroy somethin or someone and we have to make the choice to either kill him or join him which will lead to Daniel being sort of seans boss but if we end him than we live in mexico and tell the tale of Daniel like a myth
"daniel's whining is annoying" no, he's a kid. lets imagine and put yourselves in his shoes, he's a 9 year old, and in this camp there are only teens and up, whose conversation cannot be comprehend by a 9 year old, hes a kid who is active, have a great responsibility (power) on his shoulder, and he's trying to stay relevant and to do that he tried to become an 'adult' in this camp which conversation revolves around weed and booze. now tell me how annoying he is, because he's not. if anything, i feel bad for him. has his decision clash with my standing? absolutely everytime. but do i think hes annoying? no. he's just trying to fit in, and the only one he could be himself to is his big brother because age gap doesnt apply to their relationship and conversation because theyve been together for daniel's whole life. he needs sean, especially now, when at the beginning, the only one who knew of daniels power is sean, and in times when daniel need sean, sean is nowhere to be found or is hanging out with cass. i mean for sean's good health, its good that he hangs out with ppl his age but what abt daniel? ill repeat again, no one in the camp is anywhere near his age.
Life is strange part 2 has full boobs and a little view of side boob shots, anyone else think that is just a little extreme for a Life is strange game
Daniel is my least favorite character, and this proves my point why.
I really wish Sean would have powers just like Daniel üòØüòØüòØ
I love how Jack's fave gets increasingly more uncomfortable by the sex part lmaoo
54:30 he is now becoming jacksepticeye only reversed
Ok, i am mad at this 'to be continued'
I really do like jack‚Äòs choices
I genuinely do not like Daniel
3:07 looks exactly like my American staffy
im only at 19:28 but why do i have a feeling the $1400 (i think thats what it was right?) is gonna get stolen by finn. ohno
I agree with Jack about the seasons issues (though the mother is alive and we've always known that, we just don't know why she left) the setup would've been stronger had the first episode had been bonding with the dad and brothers and then he died. I also think that if the brothers had thought their mother was dead and not that she had left would've been an interesting take for them and the dad dying would've had a stronger impact on the boys. Then it could've been a struggle to go see the mom or not driving this wedge between the two as we've seen so far. Idk, maybe that's just me. Cutting out a lot of the "training" time we've heard of or seen could've been done on the road with them meeting the hippie group and seeing Daniels and Sean's relationship struggling with their dad gone and the difficulties of trying to be a parent and role model towards Daniel and Daniel struggling with a lot between his powers and everything else going on. Just imo would've been a stronger build up but who knows, the next two episodes may prove me wrong and end up working out well in the end.
Heres for another 4 months of waiting...
Me at 33:50 oh hell no
U can have my dog jack
That ending though üò£üò¨
R E L E A S E D A T E W H E N ?
Wish i could see what would of happened if he chose to not make daniel use it power wonder if it would be different
All this is just build up for Daniel's superhero/villian story. He probably killed everyone including Sean, and now he's on his own.
can we get an f in the chat for seans eye
When Sean said "sorry it sucked" I went into the deepest cringe defense layer I have.. AAAAAAAAAAA. Hope I wont say it in my big play ...
Jack see what happens when you scold Daniel too much he won't listen

You should try automation, then export it into beamng drive
Say snow :D
Jack may I say you have a majestic sexy beard
Who remembers SUMOTORI DREEEAAMZU
Me: stop in the name of the law,your arrested for committing murder and creating 28 STAB WOUNDS!
Also at 6:23 Jack talks about the diet coke truck not delivering. Me:is there a flamingo shorts truck
06:28

Better watch out for those books! I hear they buy sick kids.
7:56 That‚Äôs my 2017 jack turning into 2019 jack!
When Jack looks at his Webcam it feels like he is watching my soul.
7:35 Remember Jack it's a rocky road to Dublin lol
So good to see them take the V-chip out of Jack. Lol
Officer Jack is life! <3
Omg JACK I'm so glad you restarted the beamng series. I WAITED FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS FOR THIS VIDEO
Jack!!! That's Arizona üòÇüòÇ
Utah man once again confirming that jeeps drive autonomously in herds in Utah and get stuck on their backs like turtles
It's called the Pigeon because it's a take on the Reliant Robin.  Check out Jeremy Clarkson's Top Gear video in the Robin.  It's HILARIOUS...
You  should  play  sly cooper
This is what I like! These good edits and quick paced gameplay. Plus Jack, the metal music in the background was a great choiceüòä
Having this going in the background, 9:15 got me very confused.

Hello jacksepticeye
So i have just watched your stream thingy where you played hollow knight and i was wondering if you would like to continue it or restart it on the normal channel
If you said in an earlier video that you will not play it sorry did not know
Jack: "The next nudge will be my last!"
Also Jack: Flies his car off the side of the road into a lake
Well, you were right about one thing, but not in the way you thought XD


Least you tried.

8:50 play at .25 play back speed thank me later
0:28- "This is way too fast for me!" 124mph... yeah. Highway speed is anywhere from 55mph-80mph. You are in the equivalent of a stock car race.
1:03- "I am Toss Boy." A boy who tosses, or a boy who is tossed?
3:16- "It might be this rust-bucket of a car." It looks like a Toyota Tercel. Believe it or not, there are still a few of that type rolling around. (late 80's early 90s)
- "What are you selling? Sick kids to books?" Huh? :/ Book kids are sick? Sick books are kids? Books to sick kids? Ah, that must be it.
How come everytime he says "BeamNG" it sounds like hes saying "Bee Man Gee"
A little fast?

Dear jacksepticeye ,

I used to suffer from crippling anxiety in practically all situations. My friend introduced me to youtube and your channel. Up until then I had never used youtube and watching your videos really helped me to relax and laugh.  I have gained confidence,  little by little, thanks to you, one laugh at a time. I now even have the confidence to make my first comment on youtube, (which is this).

Please like, so Jack can see.

(Who will be first, Jack or Pewds?)
jack if you need to stop someone hit behind their rear wheel with the bumper in front of yours it spins them out and even a pro driver cant stop it think about if you want them to turn you wouldnt hit them right in the back you'd rotate them so hit their rear quarterpanel
Do some of the crashy smashy levels like in the old beamng videos

Yo sean how do you stay motivated, making YouTube videos? I guess millions of subscribers and dollars help. But when you first started out.
Jack, have you never watched Top Gear? The pigeon is a nod to the Reliant Robin, a 3 wheeler that I swear nearly gave Jezza a heart attack.
Your car should not look like that.......
So he's just pandering to children now?
hahahaha
Can we all just observe how much jack has changed since 2015üòÇüòÇ

‚ÄúWhere are we, Nebraska?‚Äù
As a Nebraskan I can confirm this is the exact OPPOSITE of what it looks like
"You're not even driving a car anymore. You're driving a Coke can that a truck drove over."
And not even a Coca Cola Zero - Same Great Coke Taste But With Zero Sugar, Now With A Hint Of Added Vanilla can!
‚ÄúThis is officer Jack signing off.‚Äù Kind of like that outro when you play this game.
7:25... Doesn't it sound a little bit like Chase?...

Are you gonna play part 2 of lis 2 ep3
this is a cool series
My name is Jandr√© and I  am  9
Can you shout out my sister Mackenzie
Went back and watched your World of Goo series. Seems you never completed it. Near the end, you were mentioning how hard it was getting. Is that why you stopped playing it?
Anyone else think jack looks like kamski now
Jack I live in Nebraska and there is literally no place in the whole state that looks anything like that. It's literally in a region called the great plains. It's all corn fields and confederate flags
9:55 that's not gonna get you that coke sponsorship...
When tabs
Noodles can fix it
5:33 Gta police
Vanoss vs Jacksepticeye. Do a collab!!

Why Jack lookin like Shia Labeouf mixed with Jared Leto?
Hey I asked you to play life is strange!!!!!
Oof

Jack. You could also try to take them out by just sticking to their bumper and flooring it. Pedal to the metal. And you can turn off the siren by pressing the M key.
Cooooooool üòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
Vanoss coped your intro
LIKE A BOSS
This video was recorded in PewDiePie's basement
Leave a like if you saw Mr. Bean!
Nobody:

Everyone: yes
It took me 8 mins of the video to realise jack was referencing robocop üòÇ
I love these so muchüòÇ the ending was the best
The gif says ‚ÄúI understood that reference.‚Äù
I, however, do not....
can't you do this kind of stuff in gta?
this series in 2014 helped me find jack
Playing car games with a PC ‚Äùlaughs in console‚Äù
Now that you're playing games you stopped playing before, maybe play KSP again too! Would be cool.

I am pissed because this episode does not have "jack staring at loading screen".
I feel like Jack would really really enjoy drag racing and demo derbies.
now this... is pod racing
It's been a long time since I've watched Jacksepticeye and now he looks like a dang Viking
Jack doess not remember the pigeon from his older beamng days
Im so happy he returned the series
4:30 is it Felix
Think about this, but in VR
me and the boys at 3 am looking for beans soon to realize there are none
Jack Nebraska doesnt really have much red rock except out west. Nebraska is more of a great plains grass, water resevoirs, and crop fields. Red rock is more of Arizona. Love the video by the way
After watching Jack with those Jeeps, I now understand where had gotten all that bottle flipping practice for his match against Pewds.
Dear jacksepticeye I want to thank you for all the years you have been on YouTube Jack I started watching you when I was 14 I am about to be 19 you were there all the times I needed to laugh along with many other YouTubers but you are one of my personal favorites because you brighten my day every time I'd watch one of your videos you're always so happy and energetic and it inspires me thank you for being so funny sincerely Justin gallentine
sexual predator car chase??? must have been james charles.
Finally

I want to see you crashed stuff into other stuff that's what I love about this series
"I'm the best policeman - officer."


Ah, I see Jack is a man of taste as well!
I think i‚Äôd like to play this game
6:17 i've gotten word that pepsi is honing in on Coca-Colas turf, we can't have that
Jack! Please consider playing a game called Gris it has a beautiful art style and a meaningful message. Thank you! x
2:25 
Me:
game: "You Got Hit"
Jacksepticeye: WELL DO YOU TINK!?!
Also me:  But, that was my line Jack :(
(only people from Jacks other video "Cluck Clukc MotherCluckers" will understand this.....
well he didnt lie when he said this ludge will be the last one.

Hi jack thanks for cheering me up
4 minutes ago, 1k comments, why jacks the best!
Commenting on every Jacksepticeye video to show my support (day 1)
Jack as a cop will only stop coke trucks to take some

He sees an unmarked truck pulls em over asks what they carrying
They say"oh just 50 tons of meth"
Jack: no coke?
Them: na sorry
Jack: move along then
do more do more do more
What about life is strange
Call me kevin > jack
Jack didn't censor the tiddies and still got monetized. What a legend
Finn at campfire: we can't change the past
Jack: but we can learn from it
Max: hold my camera
I'd trust the mom, but her name is Karen. She probably an anti vaxxer
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Finn and Cassidy keep calling Sean ‚ÄúSexy‚Äù or ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù, like are they both hitting on him lmaooooo
(Also I was so happy that you could choose who you liked in the game, ooooooo)
I swear Jack is trying to tear their brother relationship apart and see how far he could go and how crazy he can get it!
I love how finn is casually flirting with sean.
Topless lady and not demonetised 





WHAT DO YA MEAN?!?
aw man i liked seans' long hair D:
i knew finn was into sean right from the start lmao, love this bi rep ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

FINALLY! Who else has been waiting for Jack to play this?
You accidentally smoked some more and then the game saved, watch later in the game there's going to be a running scene or something and Sean is going to start coughing in the middle of it and mess up.
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM SO GOOD AT WEED!!‚Äù


-jacksepticeye 2019
its so funny to see Jack so oblivious to Finn flirting with Sean and the potential they got! i totally ship them!
Kid "I‚Äôm NOT a kid anymore!"

Young adult "I‚ÄôM STILL A KID T-T"
Cassidy is the name of my dog and every time he said her name he came running
Imo the voice acting in this game is just as realistic as the references.
Square Enix gets their games right so often
My problem with Life is Strange 2 is how useless the power is in the game and its boring plot. Literally the plot consists of Sean and Daniel's father dying so instead of seeing what happens if confronted by the cops, they are just running place to place with no value to them doing random activities that are meaningless and chatting, which is also meaningless. In the first Life is Strange, the story was more complex and interesting with time mechanics being intertwined with a tornado, meanwhile trying to discover what happened to Rachel with the player being thrown off track with a collective of shady and suspicious characters. Furthermore, Life is Strange gives the player a new time wielding mechanic that makes the game more interesting and unique, meanwhile also making the mechanic an essential part of the game to progress. This differentiates in comparison to Life is Strange 2 where not only is the power not given to the player, but the power has proven to be useless. It has not been utilized meaningfully with the plot and the fact that this is playing out so blandly ruins the game for me. Not to mention Life is Strange 2 has worse voice acting, worse expressions, and has a bland cast of characters. I couldn't care less about Sean and Daniel's relationship but in the first Life is Strange, the cast of characters are unique and intriguing and Max and Chloe's relationship is strong and makes the player feel attached to them. This is a bit of a rant, but yeah
Nobody:

Fun fact: Redwoods really are that goddamn huge. Well, the super old ones anyway.
Cassidy gives me hippie Evelyn vibes. While Sean...is Sean xD
IT'S THE PERFECT SHIpp-
Daniel complains about his brother spending too much time with his new friends, causing them to drift apart.
Sean: night bro imma stay and get a haircut
This playthrough gives me anxiety, I was so nervous for Daniel and Sean.
Daniel: Why are you still here?
Sean: Just to suffer

I was so surprised when that Swedish guy came talked about Sweden, I was like what? Did I hear that right?
Edit: Their Swedish accent is so strong it's almost like i'm talking
Sad I couldn‚Äôt hear on melancholy hill the Gorillaz are my favorite band :(
When I saw Ingrid I immediately thought of a Skyrim character
Daniel: "No!"

Sean: "Daniel, I'm both representing your privacy by knocking but asserting my authority as your older brother by coming in anyway!"
That Daniel looks just like me now with long hair
When it says Sean for subtitles do u read it as Sean yourself or Sean as the character because you are the character
I love the storytelling with them as wolves. It's so cool and cute
Stranger: you can't blame everyone for your problems 


Chloe: Hold my cigarette and beer
Jack: You're terrific, Sean!


Also Jack: ..Thanks me.
Jack: can I pet the dog
Game: Ye-
Jack: YAAAAAAAAAY!
ANYONE ELSE HEAR HANNAHS VOICE IT SOUNDS LIKE CHLOE
I remember watching Sean when he played skate 3
I love that we can make Sean gay, but wheres my Bi love :(
I know Sean's secret power it's being able to draw without Hands
Chloe: you can't control time and nature
Max and Chloe in Unison: hold my beer
Damn, voiceacting, animations, and graphics improved soo much since the first game! <3 I would love to see the first life is strange remastered like that and with animations improved :)
When the girl said pennywise, I thought about pennywise the clown,  and then jack was like hey a George. That made me laugh a lot. Jack, you know how to make people laugh
Was legit pausing and relistening to the Swedish conversation.

Ps: im not saying the vid should get demonitized, im just saying

(Edit) holy crap, thats the most likes ive ever gotten in my life, thank you guys and gals
Sean: "He didn't really help."
Me: damn
also Me: Even if somebody else there had the power to reverse time and bring back their dad and home, only Captain Spirit has the will to save the Wolf Brothers... no matter how dire his fate.
This game is been my favorite since jack played this cool game

"Daniel look it's the good cush!"
"This is the forest how good can it be?"
Doesn‚Äôt Hanna kind of sound like Jane from the taletale series:the walking dead season 2?
daniel said he would help but you clicked pick up alone so he left
Game: Hold up
Me: Waaaiiitt


Few seconds later,Jack: Hold up,waaiiitt

Me: CALLED IT! XDD
Finn comes to say: Hello ladies
Me: Shit not him
So Daniel was upset because Shaun or Sean wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention to him right?





Then JACK GOES AND IGNORES HIM AGAIN XD Jack no!

Edit: for those saying that the haircut is better for the story, yeah I didn‚Äôt know that and I was just saying that Daniel should get more brother time! So cute!
Still waiting for part 2 :/

i ship Finn and Sean tho TT
14:25 jack ese es mi hijo means that‚Äôs my son
I‚Äôm not trying to be that type of person but I think most of the choices you made were bad for the future and Daniel. Everything you do effects Daniel.
1) Since he saw you take weed, he might start taking weed alone with Finn.
2) He thinks you don‚Äôt trust him so he won‚Äôt trust you and do things by himself which might lead to a failed ending.
3) Not following him to sleep makes him feel alone and probably would make him feel like he‚Äôs embarrassing you.
When I saw the topless lady my reaction was this is demonetized
Rife rs rtrange rwo (words' 1st letter is R how you wanted Sean)

1:17:18 Jack asked "am I part of the team?" and Daniel said "Yeah"
Choose stay: "I'm gonna walk alone now?"

Choose go with daniel: "you don't have to go with me you know"
That was probably the best Pennywise impression of ever heard
when you realize jack posted more life is strange 2




why wasn't i here when this got out
But Finn! Must know more about Finn! He is such a cool dude!

I saw a comment on a different video of yours and it said "Jack you are now starting to look more and more like a Viking by the day" üòÇüòÇ
Jack what has happened to you
I adore this game. Not only because of the AMAZING story line of it, but also because the Game Makers decided to tell the story not only with the people you play but with wolves being the main characters <3 makes my Wolfie heart sing! Love the videos and the game. Lots of support! <3
Cassidy is cool and all but lyla is the waifu
When they mentioned my state I felt honored but then she mentioned the weather, which is hot as hell constantly.
I love the atmosphere of this game. The campfire scene made me feel as though I was there. It was so cozy and quiet. Cassidy also adds to the family aspect in my opinion.
Beside the good story, I'm just enjoying the swede couple with Anders talking swedich  1:25:33
jack looks like Kamski xD
Notices the half nude woman at the beginning. 
Wait a second, what?
Penny sounds like Daryl's brother from The Walking Dead
You should edit in ocean man whenever there‚Äôs supposed to be copy righted music playing
So weird to hear video game characters talk about Portland Oregon that's where I live
Jack its not called a bloody outline its called a rough sketch
16:47 i said just to suffer right when you did
Damn Sean‚Äôs recap at the begining always makes me cry

YESSS I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH

When is the next episode of Sally Face? üò≠
Thank u I been waiting for this
1:35:08  saving my spot
Jack: Should I sensor the half naked lady? Nah SCREW IT!
Imagine picking a haircut over your little brother. smh
Life is strange 2, but it has red dead redemption 2 graphics. That would be insane
I love the Shazam reference.
Amazing video jack keep up the good work and I‚Äôll see ya in the next video
Great vid, man. Also, any fellow Californians out there?
No offense, but I get a feeling that Daniel is going to turn evil bc of the choices he made toward Daniel this episode......He was pretty rude to Daniel at the knife throwing at the camp, he was pretty mean to him at the lake, and he didn‚Äôt walk him back to the tent.....He didn‚Äôt listen to him at all....I can see Daniel getting fed up with his brother and exploding at him and just go completely psycho.....
I fear Daniel is gonna grow resentful of his brother in this playthrough....I really hope he doesn‚Äôt, I want the best outcomes for these characters.......
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!
Sean's new hairstyle reminds me of Aladdin
9:51 

lets see the teacher's  parent
Why was I lowkey shipping Finn and Sean.
Life is Strange is an amazing series and game.This is amazing content !!!

Pet: looks up oh, does that bother you hooman? That deeply pleases me.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the hair cut‚Äù

ALWAYS THE HAIRCUT

THEN THE TUDE
the haircut is bad and like. go for finn.
1:35:07 sounds like a Dutch reference from red dead redemption 2üíÄ

Edit: all we need is some faith and money
I love Finn, he was flirting sooo hard. If I ever play the game I'm getting these two together ngl
If that's even possible lmao
I mean.. Daniel likes him too so that's one perfect little family
He sounds like last the cable guyüòÇ
"I'm always swinging,  sweetie!" Finn, you're a pansexual mess, and I'm living for it xD (disclaimer, I do not know if Finn puts a label on himself, but for the sake of making it pretty ambiguous just like he is, pansexual was used here to make the comment more fitting <3)
1:38:00 He's like, DAMNIT! 
He thought he was getting a hair cut from those 2 girls or one of them. :3
Nah F Daniel... I would have left him for dead
If Sean and Cassidy are a couple,
What would Lyla think about this?
Gotta love LIS2 
Dad is cool
Game: kill him
Mushroom is cute
Game:kill her
Layla is cool
Game:Push her out of the game
Sean will have the high ground during the last episode i guess XD

I LOVE THIS SERIES I HAVENT WATCHED JACK IN A WHILE BUT IM BACK BABYYYYY
i was wondering about this 2 days ago, it took too long.
I'm so weird, When Finn guy asked Sean to take a puff of the weed I shouted "N o" now everyone's looking at me weirdly.
Sean sitting here looking good with his man bun. A+ man. A+.
I really want to buy this game just to make him draw Finn. xD

Like so Jack sees this! üíï

After a slow day I need my intense jackiboi
32:22 IM FUCKNG SHOOK I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS OKAY OUT SHVSKSHSBWHW
Daniel has some power just imagine daniel bring a asteriod down to earth
Very weird to hear "Cassidy" in this game, I haven't heard my name in a game before.
Really love these videos jack keep it up
23:05ü§Øüò≥ü•µüòè
Jack:am I part of the team
Daniel:yeah
sean is 16 i googled it
Everytime jack says Daniel i keep thinking of "I'm connor" ü§£
Yessss it‚Äôs back finally
oH SO MUCH MORE IS GONNA HAPPEN, SEAN. JUST YOU WAIT.
He seriously had to pick the tree trunk up to get to the other side? Couldn‚Äôt just climb over? üôÑ
Wow a new episode of Life Is Strange, I can't wait to see this.
23 minutes later... 
Nude lady appear
Dont worry Daniel,just slow down!

2 seconds later

IM WAY EFFIN' BETTER THAN YOU!
can Daniel fly around
The big trees turns out his on kashyyk
Or my dad will punch youüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
nice videos jack! keep up the good content.
1:20:42
Sean: He might have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy
Too soon?
Penny looks like he has macaroni hair
Daniel's catchphrase should be "Yeah baby Yeah!"
:( i wanted finn & sean to get together ü§ßü§ß
It bothers how at 1:24:00, Daniel kinda sorta looks like Max
I've been telling him to play this for AGES! Who else has been wanting Jack to finish the series
YouTuber has no time for YouTube
Easter egg; the QR code on the mom's card says "work hard mustard big".
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be that hard"
Said no guy ever
sniff sniff
I SMELL A SUPER VILLAIN
Hmmm I'm not a fan of Cassidy, she's an interesting person/character and all but... I don't know.
jack singing billie just made my day.
Just dub over non copyrighted music. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
best gameplay for me pretty cozy!!
Please don‚Äôt do anything with Cassidy!üò≠ I like Llyla!
Jack: I‚Äôm so good at weed!

Neighbor: umm... 911 I think my neighbor is high on weed?!
20:00 My boy looks like Roderick from Diary Of A Wimpy Kid üòÇ
Yes plz make more of this and keep the series going yyyaaaaa!!!!!!!
when jack said that he had his coffee w him i paused and made me one, lol
yo i kinda wanna be friends with cassidy. she seems hella chill best friend );
I desperately wanna see Finn and Sean together. Also Finn is oddly attractive for a video game character
6:18 with him going to something called FAILURE AND GUEST no wonder he thinks he sucks at art.
originally i didn‚Äôt think Sean was that cute,,,,,,BUT THIS BITCH GOT MY HEART NOW WHEW
1:38:44 best partüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
NOT A HATE COMMENT!

Jack your a fool you should have gone with Daniel to remake your brother ship
i lost it when we first saw hannah üòÇüòÇ
ok ik this is probs weird vut your voice is really southing with headphones in
ik I had this comeing watching ur channel BUT IM ONLY TEN XDDD
i pick up on the sUbTlE flirting coming from finn and look up the too of them (sean and finn) and it's just tHeRe and gAy
I wish you‚Äôd picked the option where Sean said he thought some boys were cute. Sean and Finn are so much fucking cuter than Sean and Cassidy ‚òπÔ∏è
According to other videos he could somehow get a gun and do something
jesus where did all these characters come from
Aw man I want Sean and Finn to be a couple
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road?







Because he didn't have the guts
Finn is hands down my favorite character (':
DO ANOTHER EPISODE OF THIS!!!!!
One of jack's videos on life is strange is privated. I wonder what happened for that
I really like how the brothers interact with each other, it feels so real
Bruh what happened to dad‚Äôs voice
Really wanted to see the rest of the story so I thought to find another gameplay and then I realized this game is based of choices and someone else story is different :( So I am patiently waiting for your next video. Also, kind of wish you would have went back with daniel because he has stated so many times that you always want to be with your friends instead of him.
PleASE DON'T MAKE DANIEL THE ANTAGONIST DDD:
oh no what happened to his hair
who else got the ''I'm a bad guy'' reference? bright burn
43:00 3/4 of an hour into the game... O.K. Roll Intro!
So were just gonna ignore the naked bittys?





Ok. üòê
Jacob kinda looks like Post Malone
‚ÄúEverybody has value, you need to figure out what that value is in people and learn from them‚Äù 

~ jacksepticeye 2019
i really like this epsoad nice trow bro
Hi jack sorry I might need to catch up GREAT VIDEO have an Spectacular day!! cya later
Me: man i wonder when jack will go and play life is strange




jack: so we are going to play life is strange ep 3




Me: wow its been 6 hours
jack sounds like tow mator from cars
Why does Jacksepticeye look like Kamski from Detroit
I love how they can put a topless girl in the video but cant have music without it being copyrighted
1:22:18 1:24:07
Darth Vader wants to know your location
I think Hannahs and chloes voice actor is the same person <3
The voice actor for Hannah is the same voice actor for Max caufield in the first one
It‚Äôs triggering me that they don‚Äôt put accent marks on the Spanish subtitles.
"Not until I get a signal from God." Well... Jacob. Talk to him in the meantime. He may not answer right then and there, but he will answer in his own PERFECT time.
Since when did S√©an become Larry the Cable Guy
I see you‚Äôre going for cassidy in this gameplay, could you pretty please after this one make one with finn‚Äôs path?:)))
Edit: I‚Äôm not saying everyone needs to watch, if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm saying, Jack continues this gameplay with cass as he wants and then after he‚Äôs done everything, do a separate one with finn, like he did with detroit choosing all the bad choices^^
PENNY LOOKS LIKE A FORTNITE SKIN!!!!
Man I really don't care what anyone says but i'm sitting here like Daniel=SUPERVILLAIN
OMG JACK KNOWS BILLIE IM DYING
YEEEEES FINALLY
I wish I had a group of friends like the end of this episode. Honestly, I cried. One day, team. One day.
Jack: Plays Weed Empire Simulator
LiS2: Hold my beer
23:04 DEMONETIZED
Hannah sounds a bi t like chloe
Do more darn it
11:27 nuggies (hard) for going into his room 15:28 go's into Daniel's room when Daniel said not to







WAIT A MINUTE
I am Vengeance
I am the Night 
I..AM....
Daniel
1:19:27 "I'm the Baad Guyy... DUH" I SCREAMED I love Billie Eilish and the fact that Sean knows of her just killed me haha
I hate to said this, but i miss lyla characterüëâüëà
Sean should be 17 by episode 4.
Day 1 of thanking Jack for his hard work
1:18:02 "how do i anything?"







Same.
That first flashback where Esteban says "I can't do this alone" Really hits hard for me. As the eldest kid out of me and my sister, with a single dad, it really is hard to be in that situation.
Down to the elder kid frustration, the younger kid being a agitated and irritable along with the "I don't want to grow up", it hits so close to home it's not funny.
But yeah, it's, really relatable, to me. It kinda hurts in a way. But yeah.

Anyway. I like your playthrough, JSE, I've enjoyed it a lot, and it's nice to see everyone's unique reactions to it. It's nice. Hope it continues to be awesome as it goes on.
1:17:19 jack: am I part of the team Daniel: yeah
1:05:45 she looks like mia khalifa
Sean you also have the chance to go with finn it doesn't have to be cassidy
Jack: okay
Hannah: okay
23:05
lol emagine if there was a fire.  everyone in the near erea would be high lol
The Finn "storyline" is more interesting but Cassidy is pretty cool too.
How is this not age ristricted
what ?0:01 your name is Jacksepticeye ? i thought i clicked on greenpewdiepie61
jack: come on sean u looked better me: yeah jack I mean sean u looked better ha gothem did u get it?
Jack the reason why you cant find daniel after picking up the water tank is because you chose to "pick up alone". The choice would've changed if you just waited for Daniel.
Jack looks like Kratos minus the tatoo on his face
Heya Jack! I know this isn't related to the video, but I have a game I'll think you'll really enjoy. It's called Dark Deception, you can get the first chapter for free on Steam!
"meow"üòÇ
Season 1 manipulating time and space, Season 2 real life simulator
These characters are so good
It‚Äôs so empty at the start of moving around
I forgot the main characters name was Sean and I got really confused for a second there
YES FINALLY THE GAME IS FINALLY OUT
Cut Weeds everyday
Sean is 16/17 years old.
‚ÄòNot a single F. Not a single Father‚Äô I genuinely spat out my tea
I don't care who covers this game...there is no game player better than JACK. I would wait for jack to play this over other channels!!
All of a sudden Daniel starting to look a little like that kid from that upcoming movie "Brightburn."






Fun.
Nudity: Exists

Hannah: It‚Äôs free real estate
age restricted woo
Ah this episode hits home I was born in Humboldt.
Finn and sean have great chemistry

I hope we get to see more of them together üíôüíô
that billie eilish reference üëÅ
I go for a month, come back and you have a ponytail and a long beard.
God?
Did anyone else catch that Hannah said she was from Arcadia Bay and was kidnaped by some crazy guy
oh shit


car alarm noise
Jack- "TOP OF TE MORNIN"

Me at 9:24 -"I'm still a peace of garbage
I really rather have the music, it feels like we're missing part of the story, part of the journey is through the music
Noo I liked his hairrrr
"I don't know might be the milkman's"
i guess you could say he make some milk that night
MORE!!!
Me: Hasn't watched any of Jack's playthroughs of this game

Also me: Let's watch this episode and not get a single reference
1:22:10 thought he was gonna split an atom in half and nuke the place
2018 part 2
your man bun is coming along nicely  :-)
See does anybody know there running from the copsüòëüòëüòë
I JUST woke up and I immediately watch this. I REGRET NOTHING
Edit: I am sad we can't hear the songs . Cause actually I love the songs
I hope Sean's power will be like Photograph, like he memorises the picture and draw it on any thing
does the animation seem a bit sloppier than usual? Like, lower quality. idm it but.. yea
" I wanna go camping with my friends"
friends? What friends?
dirty hippy! dirty hippy! sean mcgloflin 2019
I was waiting for a "HI DANIEL!" for a full 8 minutes
Jesus is the truth, the way, and the life. :) THAT is the truth. Some people need to find that, sure but it does not change.
Just saying, I've worked trimming weed for a family friend (I live in Oregon) and it wasn't nearly as shady and dangerous as this place....the clipping gameplay was accurate though üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It said pick up alone or together
It must be cool having the same name as the main character in a game!
41:00 i love how you can hear the swedish couple or friends argue while the Guy is speaking swedish and she is speaking english...ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüóø (i‚Äôm swedish:))
DID JACK JUST REFERENCE A BILLIE SONG
When he chose to get a haircut instead of to stay with Daniel I got pissed, because Daniel literally just said that Sean is not spending enough time with him. Stupid tbh
O like penny voice
awe i wish you drew fin to make the gay romance! now i need to play to be as gay as i can
Jack: I‚Äôm the bad guy
Me/jack st the time time: duh
Me: üòÇ
And Finn reminds me of my best friend üòÇ
1:35:00 Ok, Dutch üëå
Wait is it just me or does Finn sound like Micah bell from rdr2?
Ah no cola cola with zero sugar but same taste with a hint of vanilla
1 hour of jacks voice no ads my dream
YEEESSS! I WAS SCREAMING WHEN I SAW YOU UPLOAD THANK YOU JACK!! AAAAAA
Humboldt is only 2 counties over from where I live it's nice to see a place in a game that I've actually been to
Can't wait for episode 4 and 5
EXCUSE ME.. DO YOU LISTEN TO BILLIE SEAN LOL
Pls go camping and vlog some leave out the part where u getting hammered
FINN IS REALLY BEING NICE TO SEAN HE SEEMS TO BE A COOL GUY üòé
I really wanted Cassidy to say, ‚ÄúWow. You got my sexy knees too.‚Äù
50:04look at Cassidy‚Äôs hand
Big joe looks like the bandit elite from rainbow six siege
men, sean(in the game) is such a furry! isn't he
You didnt get the worst nor the best ending you just got the neutral endings jack from the last episodes! Though major things are in a split screen dicision theres also small things butterfly effect
Eleven I think we found you a boyfriend 1:24:23 season 4 new character I feel sad for mike
Will you play unraveled 2 with me when it comes out?
Powers out at my house

not a knock on sean but i really wish more people would go the finn route. i feel like he is really under appreciated.
2 Brothers Weed Farm Simulator
It sounded like the topless girl said "lotter" instead of water xD
I played this ep too
and it was amazing
Nobody
Not a single soul
Yoda: Strange is life
I made the joke ‚ÄòRacelands? More like RacistLands‚Äô

I died laughing
Did anyone else realise the NYC UK. Shirt was a uncopywrited Santa Cruze shirt cause seans a skater
The "I love you Lyla" from last episode (I think?) really still hurts my heart. There were moments like that with Sean when Daniel was practicing his powers and the brothers were butting heads. I dunno what it is about Sean's character, but when shit hits the fan, the way he reacts always melts my heart in a good way.
Jwck play the forest its an adventure survival based game
Sean  and Daniel‚Äòs relationship is like me and my brothers just I‚Äôm Daniel
Jack is starting to look like Jesus from TWD
26:03 no censor? YouTube is gunna keeeeyal you.
sis coulda made sean queer
YEEEEAAAAAAAHHHH
Karen Diaz didn't take the kids.
daniel if you don't stop i'm going to mf slap you through the screen
Penny: Oh my god it‚Äôs a ufo
Finn: they‚Äôre finally here to take you back
News reporter: these people have never been found again last place seen is at the forest
RIP
"Please dont tell me there isnt copyrighted music here"

Gets a muted ad

Me: am i a joke to you
idk if its bc im slightly in love with finn but i low key wanted sean and finn to hook up
Jack: "I get to play as my boy Sean, I get to play as myself"

THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING!!
Has anyone else noticed that finn looks a little bit like  6ix 9ine? Or is that just meü§î
1:07:42 ‚Äúpick up alone‚Äù
Jack: ‚ÄúWHERE‚ÄôS DANIEL!?!?‚Äù
Wait, how is the dad back, i thought i saw episode 2, did i miss something?
1:02:40 preach it! There's no planet B! üôå‚ô•Ô∏èüåç
Jack/sean ur the best youtuber ever
I need more of this!!!!!
Shampoo is something you put in your hair when you have a shower
Aren‚Äôt people noticing this?  Sean‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù shirt has a wolf in it.  So it is pretty much saying wolf squad and the brothers are ‚Äúwolves‚Äù!!!!!
im the bAaAaAaD GuYyY.....




Duh
PLEASE PLAY A PLAGUE TALE: INNOCENCE!! I think it could be a really cool story series! Like Detroit!
Daniel be like
Daniel: oh what is this
I lovve Seans haircut
Jack "I don't have time" the video is 1 hour long
This whole no music thing is really ruining the immersion for me.
FINALLY!!! I‚Äôve been waiting for this for so long! Thanks for the upload!
Jack just went all rafiki on us there at 1:34:23
Why is that when you think the woods are a bad place to stay in but where they live right now looks and feels cozy. I don't know why but it does
Sean looks like Rodrick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid @ 19:52
The haircut is awesome.
No one:
Jack: They have a really familiar voice
19:11 that bird sound is real, and super common in the USA
Who just tries to think of the good old jack like evie bot
Looks like Karen didn't take the kids
You know, for a weed farm, all these people are pretty damn uptight. Lol
*Grabs tissues



*ok,where is the sadness in this ep
we better see lyla again 
her and Sean are the cutest
jack asked how old sean was so i searched it up and he has the same birthday as me and is exactly one year older and this is the coolest thing to happen on my birthday aside from it also being the date at the beginning of detroit: become human
Cassidy does have those nice thighs and any option relate to her I pick it.
How is this monetized?
Hi Jack. I have loved your channel for years. I started watching when you began ur skate 3 series and I was hooked after that point in time. I stopped watching around 2 years ago but I've come back to thank you for many years of enjoyment in this ever changing world you've given me, and hopefully the same for many to come. Best of luck in the future Sean, and dont forgot about who you are as your channel grows as you are on of the few creators I can name who haven't changed with fame and I can respect credibility that that.

 See you around and stay positive!
44:59 mr.hankie on south park
Does anyone think he looks like Joseph Seed or John Seed
Well that haircut doesnt fit Sean ü§®üòã
Come through with the Billie Eilish reference
I know we're all obsessed with Cassidy, but what happened to Lyla or Jenn?
these games won't work unless they have several plots like Detroit, otherwise people will just watch them instead of paying for it
1:41:46
WHAT ABOUT BOTH?!?!?!?!!?
I wish you chose Sean to go to bed with Daniel. Since, he said it that he wants more time with Sean. Aww Jack:(
Jack looks sooooo different, I kinda like the new look.
I love your Videos






Nobody likes my comments though, so i'm going to like my own.
Man, nice beard jacky boy
OW pink lighting!
JaCk, DanIeL has been hurt. Poor buddy. Daniel needs a freaking hug.
You can tell Jack is straight the way Finns flirting went right over his head loo
Aww.. He's wearing the ol dogs scarfüî•‚ù§
I read Sean and Daniel as Sam and dean.....
I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME
I ship him And cassady
If Life is Strange 2 is so great, then why isn‚Äôt there a Life is Strange 2 2?
My catchphrase for him is dan the man, he always has a plan üëç
when the bird sound happend i heard the same bird irl
Penny sounds like Romeo Santos
When Sean got high; that‚Äôs how it really be üòÇüòÇ
"wait were working on a weed farm? Sean, you dont need to go anywhere, you're home"
1:16:28 me: so what kind‚Äôa trainin‚Äô we doin‚Äô today? Water bending?
Sean needs powers to control that boy
üòÆüòÆ JACK!! Your hair!
u notice how sean and cassidy both have the same face model?
People: down at the lake
Towele: make sure you bring a towel
Sean: ok
Towele: want to get high
Sean: Hell yes 
39:56 Jack sounds like Michael from The Office lol
Missed the game so much forgot it came out every month
It‚Äôs probably really weird for jack because every time he looks in the comments says Sean he‚Äôs like. ü§®
üòÇtell me he doesn‚Äôt look like Shia LaBeouf
Oof
Daniel and Scarlet Witch would be friends...
1:34:21 i have a feeling that some word might giving me a sign of max caulfield or i don‚Äôt know its a sign
41:52 Romanian Brothers UNITE
he did talk about the mother still being alive
"Secret base"

My weeb self: KIMI TO NATSU NO OWARI SHOURAI NO YUME





Sorry this was unrelated
So....Sean Is a furry?
It called phi
39:50 I just instantly thought of that prop hunt episode. ‚ÄútHiS Is mY A mAtErIaL a MaTeRiAl WhO tOuChEd YoU!!!‚Äù
53:32 boss fight revealed
35:10 who else was worried about Sean's neck. Daniel had a VANYA MOMENT
50:52 was the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever heardüòÇ
OMG I LOVE YOUR PENNIEWISE THE DANCING CLOWN INPRETION
43:21 Sean sounds like mater from cars Lol
23:00 de demonitised in 3 2 1
I wish you could play as Daniel and kick ass
I refused to watch any videos on this till jack released one.
3:43 beard ASMR
cassidy said the joker line
Big Joe looks like Kratos
I'm currently half way in the episode at 50:45. My prediction is that the police will show up. I'll edit this and tell you if I'm right or wrong.
 I was wrong, I think
Finn and Jake. Adventure Time.
This whole thing was about the big brother not being around but then you chose to make him walk back. That's so sad. Q^Q
43:31 did Jack just expose himself as Mater from Lightning McQueen!??
when did Jack become american
Who else thinks Finn looks like Wade from GTA 5
Really seemed like Jack was hardcore stereotyping people who smoke weed in this video. Could have just been him copying his interpretation of the characters, but it felt like more than that to me.
Ingrid is a name also in skyrim the game they look alike
Jeez, Finn is amazing xD
Lmaoo I can‚Äôt stop replaying 58:03
Jack: I am SO good at weed!
Dad: walks in
Me: oh hey
I need to buy this game
It‚Äôs a fact that jack was put on a list after commenting on the weed
Daniel has the force
I wanna see it come down to Daniel becoming evil, and Max having to stop him. Some sort of interaction between the two.
Why sean never said "control your emotion."
i itched my earsame time jack did
Jack looks more and more like a super chill and awesome dad
That big Joe, it's only me or he did look like kratos?
what if the whole family got super power but there dad didn't tell and Daniel just found he's first?
Jack: consider yourself capped fool

Me: whips out the uno reverse card I have
‚ÄúShut up Siri no one asked you !‚Äù That line is way to relatable for me üòÇ
sean (in game) is elon musk. did u see the way he hit that blunt....
They were talking about Louisiana and New Orleans and stuff and that made me so happy üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
I would live to see Daniel with an arrow would be dope like yondu from guardians of the galaxy
Jack u have a kabal hair style
Whenever there are cutscenes, if you look in the top left, you just seen Jack caressing his throat.
Is it just me or does he look kinda like Joseph Seed from FarCry 5 with that haircut and beard?
i never watched you in a year then i looked at your face cam and i yelled wtf who‚Äôs that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i was free all day tom
but jack didnt upload life is strange


now i am busy and jack decides to upload life is strange
ooof that stuff about growing up and being a big bro really hits home
Yay Chicken wings is playing episode 3
20 minutes in and there is a top less woman
4:00 it's just so depressing üòê
They're pulling a Clementine. "You into to dudes or you into girls uwu now you gotta pick." I can smell the ship wars already.
i didn't like the nude in the game i wish there was something in the options to censor them like what they do with the music
Sean did you get a hair cut?
Daniel: It's all you got?! Sean: No, try to lift the whole world! Daniel: Aw shit, here we go again!
Yes they finally released this
Finn is so hot what the fuckkkkkk

Edit : Sean is also hot when he looks all rough ooof help
damn it daniel
Oh my god Jack keeps on choosing the wrong desisions
Where‚Äôs my 1080p resolution
I want to see a high Jack
Oh my jack NEW HAIR im back to your yt channel btw
Dan the man is a FRIGIN game
daniel said that cassidy is weird while he's hanging out with finn ,,   hMmm
I think that if the government got a hold of Danial that they would use him as a war matching
I think Finn was flirting with Sean üëÄ
2 years later....i forgot about this channel




Youtube:
Is anyone else troubled by the fact that Cassidy is much older than Sean?
If there's a playbox is there a stationX?
You should have go with Daniel u stupid or he will stay with Finn
THAT WAS SO GOOD SO FAR!!!
How Long are we gonna stay here?
Jack whispers: forever
I freaked out and turned around to see who was behind me.
I'm not the only one who watches Gundam
Here's a catch phrase the man has a plan
Hey Jack, can you add music, that isn‚Äôt copyrighted, over parts that have copyrighted music so it isn‚Äôt so silent/awkward? Like, can you maybe pick music that is similar that you think would fit really well for the mood it‚Äôs supposed to set, and add it to those parts? It just makes the game immersion so much more enjoyable with music. Doing a great job with this game! I like your choices so far and can‚Äôt wait for the next! Thanks for playing for us! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèªüíöüíöüíö
This says a lot about society, and yet, we live in one
Is it just me or does big Joe look like Michael from gta 5
I know someone has probably already made this joke but...

If you wanna find karen just get a manager and she'll come out in no time
i like sean‚Äôs haircut only from a distance
So... next episode?
Karen Diaz didn‚Äòt keep the kids...
YouTube after seeing this video: D E M O N I T I Z E D
22:57 jacks reaction is priceless lmao
I feel like jack is driving Daniel away by choosing his friends instead,therefore making Daniel a villain in the end
I swear to god some of Jacks decisions make me wanna scream, he's literally choosing almost everything to ruin his relationship with Daniel
19:15 sean said: that stalk bird sound
I swear 3 seconds later I hear a bird
1:37:19 chris columbus when he finds the carribian natives
40mins: I was smoking weed i live in Seattle love watching you play this game Sean (jacksepticeye)
1:19:28
who saw Hannah topless and thought "Should he be showing this?"
I'm so glad that Jack went for the haircut option because literally nobody that I've watched play this has gone down that route :D
Is it bad that I ship Finn And Penny?
I live in Louisiana lol it‚Äôs really hot this time a year üòÇ
I accidentally watched part 2 first
soooo, um, my mom walked in and saw a topless lady.
5:18 after being so lonely, thought he might try find his big brother magazines
U 4got to left clic
Im so good at weed ‚Äúdrug bust at jacksepticeye on the news‚Äù
I like the communism in this family
Finn best character
We‚Äôre just going to ignore jack singing bad guy üòÇ
I want to like Daniel bc I feel bad but its really hard rn bc he's being a liTTLE EMO SHITHEAD WITH THIS ATTITUDE.
Why does Cassidy‚Äôs hair remind me of aloy from horizon zero dawn
Never played it but u should have chosen Daniel at the end u put ur friends first in that decision i think Daniel's gunna be pissed at Shaun üòÇüòÇ
Calling it finn gona die
I watched all the adds fully so you got paid.hope you got the money
Jack knows BAD GUY which means he knows Billie Eyelash. AHHHHHHHH!
44:34 Sean taking mental notes and pictures
The world needs more people like jack
Is talking yawning at the same time because he's talking in his head
I have a crush on a girl named Cassidy
At these times 2016..17...& 18 have come to Bully you when 2019 comes to pick you up off your knees and throw you across the room...

i was hoping when he for a haircut it would be a mohawk or something... hell yeah!
Its called figure of speech
Why my boi Sean not using his weed pipe?
Had a feeling Finn also liked guys. Sean and Cassidy are a cute couple though.
That blink though 18:39
The intro mentions "ancestors", those are the grandparents
I kinda wanted him to say some boys are cute and see where things could go with Finn because Finn flirting with Sean was pretty cute
Bobs or vagana which ever will it be?..
in this story Karen left the kids
Love the cozy campfire scence at the end.
The best present for finishing my tests
Finn is secretly mimir
It's been so long since this show i all most forgot about it üòëüòë

Wouldnt they get high even though ots not lit shouldnt they
Ever since he got the powers I have thought that he will turn into the hunt for the wilderpeople kid from deadpool 2
1:15:50 when halfway through my sentence I realise my dads in the room
Riding on 2%jack
It is quite odd seeing Sean drink something other than Coca Cola while playing this game.
Why does Sean look like Stephen from danplan
This reminds me of the relationship of Kratos and Atreaus when Atreause was giving him attitude.
The characters are deeper into uncanny valley than we thought was possible
Look im not one of those video game gun nuts but its armalight rifle not assault rifle
Me: hey jack how do I find a date?
jack: ALWAYS SWIPE RIGHT...ON YOURSELF

Me: mmkay
tats funny cos im 8 years older than my lil bro
Wait a min did I just see BOBZ
I was waiting to see this for weeks and now THANK YOU
Cassidy is the jokers sister!!?!?üò≥üò≥
Kinda wished you would have kept the music in but I get why, and yeah the voice acting, story, and writing is just amazing this season. Im also faithful to lyla üòÇüòÇ idk why I just think she's a better match for Sean, I really wanted to romance Cassidy but...I'll have to see
he should have drawn finn :((
Omg the mom has poweres and ran to protect the family
Liberal Propaganda is Strange 2

Why does Jack look like Elijah Kamski??
I have to last name diaz and ive never been this far from home
This episode could‚Äôve been better thought out.
Jack why you smoking man. That a bad choice now be Will die
been wateing for this for so long
I love how Finn is Bi. It's amazing.
23:12 Unexpected üòÆ I thought they would blur them for monetization reasons
How is this not demonetized?
Please pick Finn.
YO WTF I LIVE IN HUMBOLDT!!!!
well i think MAX CAULFIELD would have to disagree when FINN said "you cant change the past" ...lol
Did anyone notice that Penny's real name is Baptiste :D like the OW healer :D :D
i cant wait for episode 4! anybody else?
Loved it when Jack started singing "Bad Guy"
Yeah the forest is great all the septic jelly around I mean what!

Rip ads

FINALLY
I get you're busy an all....


BUT HOW CAN YOU STOP IT HERE üò≠üò≠üò≠
I MISS LYLA!!!!!!!!
More life is strange 2 or ill end it all
Jack: Damn Yutes!!
Daniel is crossing over to the dark side of the force
Why does Merrill look and sound like Hugo strange from Batman Arkham city
I think as he gets older his powers grow
33:57 you missed because of Daniels power
As soon as he said squirrel  I thought, up
Finn sounding like Dutch
I was hoping youd pick Finn over Cassidy but its fine im just crying out my gay heart
Wow, two whole days and it's still up, topless girl and everything? Is YouTube finally calming?
The guy with the glasses looks like gus from breaking bad
would have been nice to see sean (the character) talk about liking boys. he might have had an anecdote from seattle or something
Um, Jack you forgot to edit (blur) something

I mean we don't care and all but the big bad demonitize is going to hunt you down
50:12 did anyone notice the girl infront of sean ( forgot the name ) her hand going right through the jar?
THICCCCCCC drugss
Aww Brody :(
i kinda hate Hannah
Sean looks cuter with long hair
Sounded like she said goodnut
I don't know why, but the character Jacob sounds a lot like Tenn from The Walking Dean Final Season... probably same voice actor
I‚Äôm from Louisiana and trust me it‚Äôs not nice this time of year I can fill a Olympic size swimming pool just with the sweat of cutting my yard.
Is this video getting demonetized lol
The dialogue is the Life is Strange games is SO CRINGE!
1:05:11 i think she is Gabbie Hanna lol
She looks like her and sounds like her
Your beard though
AAAAAAAAAND DEmonitized...
The hair... Samurai Jack!
Anyone else feel like Jacks Sean is coming off as...selfish? While trying not to be? 
Daniels main problem is Sean picks his friends over him. Its always been a problem. 
Jack : Sean needs to socialize picks friends over daniel 
To Daniel this is NOT ok.
It was so wheard to hear the guy talk swedish at 1:25:00 and i am swedish my self
ONE OF US
ONE OF US
you ruined the experience by muting the episode... Just ask the game developers for premission to use the music in the game bro, they'll understand
44:50 Please Jack no!!
i love this game so much holy shit TYSM FOR PLAYING IT !!
Bruh you really need to lay attention to Daniel
when daniel blue up that tree i inmagen the puma
28:30 The guy ln The chair looks like lil dicky
Omg cassidy's singing . A lovable family surrounded by a fire. Weed. That's legit the kind of cozy  thing I want in life. Is this part supposed to be making me cry?
I shouldn't watch it, because I haven't played it and I don't like spoilers, especially for story games.
But I watched it anyway.
dan the man here to lend you a hand
That games $50 and the first one is $20 mind blown
I wanna know what Jack's stance is on weed
just because he has powers his saying his not a kid anymore?? naniii.?..?
Can somebody explain why is Jack suddenly losing so many subscribers??! After Tuesday he and few other youtubers started to lose subscribers and I'm juste wondering why
and I'm not saying like "omg nobody likes him now" I think it's incredible how he has come this far!!

Also sorry if my English is bad :P
Thank god
Tfw he won't get demonitized for the music, it's for dem titties
33:56 damn daniel.
What happened to Daniel??? He grew up super fast and is now a super huge jerk.
Why do these choice games write such annoying kids all the time
Shut up Siri no one asked you!!!
Speed is key
1:24:44 mic drop
I feel like they could have literally just crawled over the log
cough is it just me or is Finn coming onto Sean, talking about how "hot and cool" he is and how scars would make him "sexier" like um boiiii cough cough MAKE OUT ALREADY... I mean ya know, just a thought

like "did you have a good day at work honey" could be him actually wanting to call him that and not just a joke
or "i feel you Sean...as always" he's trying to make Sean realise that how much Finn understands him


okokok I need to stop before Finn turns out to be a bad influence or something
Am I the only one that thinks that Cassidy kinda looks like Gab?
Imagine Jack had a little brother
This dude sounds like yatchy
22:10 I mean maybe I'm thinking it through a little much Jack... but I think your counterpart Sean meant his VIRGINITY not the condoms themselves lol...
i love cassidy and i will never bash the way anyone plays the game..... but...... couGH finn x sean cOUgh
It's Brightburn all over again.
How did you not get  demonized?
Speed is still key
damn what if sean & daniel run into max & chloe at some point in the story and they beg max to rewind time, back to when their dad was still alive and none of this ever happened
do you know that there is a pretentious game 4 & 5
Was waiTING
I liked sean‚Äôs shaggy hair ü•∫
Big Joe's Probably sitting over in the corner playing Fortnite
I like Sean's hair
I know know one will care but 
1: there is a character called Sean and jack is called Sean 
2: my name is Finn and there is a character called Finn 
3: jack is Irish I‚Äôm Irish 
4: JACK IS MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBER
YAS

Oh look, a source of Jack‚Äôs happiness, A dog!

That's not a little cup of coffee. It's pretty big.
Man Sean I hate it that you're missing out on the music in this episode! Its so good!
finn likes sean XXXDDD
Why is stoping for a second and resumes  why???
near the beginning when jack is question Sean's ability to talk while yawning , tho isn't he thinking what jack is hearing during that moment?
54:58 Cassidy: "I wanna see some water"  Jack: "There's water in the cups" I mean, "you right" XD
1:05:10 Hannah is voiced by Hannah Prichard (she was Ruth in "Barack Obama Will Save Us")
There was a bug ( Daniel face ) 1:16:52
of course the moms name is.... ùêäùêöùê´ùêûùêß
Is it me or penny sounds like Winnie the pooh
Never get high on your own supply jack
Plot twist
Sean is doing the powers and making it seem like he has the powers, just like Daniel and Chris
ahhh no kissing finn here :(((
I actually think scars are sexier
they give an Aro/Ace option!!!!
Hannah's voice actor was Chloe's voice actor in the first life is strange

Finn turned into dutch from red dead talking about costa rica
NOOO DIDINT KNOW YOU REC IT AND I WATCHED OTHER YOUTUBER PLAYING IT UHH HATE MYSELF
The force is strong with this one
Daniel.
Doesnt do fortnite dances... Doesnt dab in public... Can move things with his mind... That is a unique legendary build right there!
I remember seeing a fallout 4 vid with a really hideous character and the vid got demonetized for it, but boobies here is fine.
I had to watch this or jacks dad would punch me
Do YouTube‚Äôs also make more money depending on how many adds they put in a video?
52:43 
Ignore this, its for me.
I think max caulfield must intervine as a super hero to fight daniel
I have a brother with 15 years younger. I was youngest for 15 years. Watching this game makes me want to be a good-er big brother.
OH MY OH MY
James charles
Why is it only 720p?
Hey Random Person Scrolling Through The Comment
Hope you have a good day/night
I love this rag tag team of hippies :)
Why doesn't Daniel just fly themselves to Mexico lmao
Alright Louisiana let's goooo 53:50
im sorry, but those plants were straight midü§¢ü§¢
Am I the only one who gets creeper vibes from Finn with Daniel
Daniel is wearing Mushrooms Bandana
Ingrid needs sunblock.
Damn I cant wait for the plot twist when Sean gets powers and has to stop Daniel
23:04
11:12 Sean it stands for NEW YORK CITY UK!
It‚Äôs a shame we can‚Äôt hear the original music due to copyright, but gotta love life is strange play throughs!
HEZ INZ THEZ ATTIC
My name is Sean and I also have a younger brother to take care off. We often fight at times until today
Finn looks like lil pump
Jesus i wasnt expecting the original intro so i put my volume all the way up with earbids and i jumped so hide
The this remind you of that movie coming out bright burn
I predict that Daniel is going to accidentally kill sean
53:57 that‚Äôs my home
Ha! I do that everytime I say Duh now,  too! Billie Eilish changing duh forever lol
OH NO john wicks dog is ded
Watch Seans hand @53.00
23:04 that face he made
big joe looks like Michael from gtav.
I kinda wanted sean to get with finn honestly
Murder mountain
I thought the dad was dead
Daniel is the one that really needs a haircut.
Nobody:

Literally nobody:

Absolutely nobody what so ever:

Jack: VISUALS
I'm confused if they have the same mom and dad why does only Daniel have the powers
Anyone else hear Hannah say that someone tied her up in arcadia? I might be wrong but Hannah was one of the names if you look.
EEEEEEEEEEEE YAY
This is like The Chronicles movie!!!:)
Jack is just throwing away likes to the comment section... Everybody has one ..



Can i get one ü•∫
When you are high and cummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Am I the only one who it started messing up on at the end!
damn hes way better than max
23:05 u forgot to censor it now YouTube‚Äôs after u
1:27:10 JACKKKKKL NOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYY what happened to being a good older bro???? How is smoking da WEED in front on your lil bro being a good influence!?!?  JACKCKCKCKCKCLCLCK... okay I‚Äôm calm idk it just triggered me 1:30:20 OH FOR THE LOVE OF- over it
WAIT THE MOMS NAME IS KAREN!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
speaks romanian and his name's joe? interesting
Hey Jacka Sean, are you  to Karen T Check for it? 
It felt like a joke to me. Ya know like go to Hellen Hunt for it. ok I'm done teasing. I thought funny though.
Yayyy
I will always miss jack fron 2013 to 2017üòîüíî when he wasnt egoist and so sexual
Daniel seems like he could easily becoming a super villain, like he‚Äôd be the bad guy at the end
...Uncensored?.... That was... very unusual to say the least a,a
i wish the music wasnt copyrighted because its really awesome...
Doesn't Daniel kinda look like goku if he was made by the people who made the sonic movie
Karen left and didn't take the kids
as I myself is Swedish, they did not sound even remotely Swedish
I was hoping you pick the gay badboy option :/
Hannah owned those two Swedish libtards lol
Doesn‚Äôt Daniel remind me of eleven in stranger things because he has telekinesis
I think hanna has something to do with Chris, and that family. Chris‚Äôs mother was an artist and so was Hannah‚Äôs unless it‚Äôs a false trail but why would developers add it?
Hannah, to me, sounds a lot like Chloe from season 1. I looked it up, its not, but just sounds like her.
I think the reason he keeps talking and yawning is because he‚Äôs talking in his head.
What do you say to your little brother with powers to explain why youre in controll?
Why I missed this video?
19:39 hey guys welcome back to my asmr licking guess what we‚Äôre licking today üòâ






Yes it‚Äôs Sean‚Äôs foot what did u think it was
why does Jacob sound like Tenn from The Walking Dead the final season, is it the same voice actor?
Anyone else think Danelle flooded arcadea bay
me over here infront of my parents then 23:04 pops up I-I-I cant explain this.....
That long blonde haired sweedish dude sounds like Nanners' sweedish triend teijb, or tezb, or, however the hell you spell his name.
Dan the Man has a plan!
is that dutch van der linde on budget


1:35:09
If I was Sean I would call area 51
Bad choices
Daniel started to feel feverish......Bet no one gets it
I love balls
anyone else think Sean looks like mallek adalov? Just me?
13:50 he still is.
When I saw the lady with no shirt I was just like ‚Äúoh okay‚Äù I mean there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it obviously but it took me by surprise
I love Pennywise aka Penny.
Daniel is John wick
3:34 On melancholy hill by Gorillaz
14:45 üòÇ
is it me or did Sean skip a video, the beginning doesnt make any sense with the tent?
Why does Jacob sound like Tenn from the walking dead
43:26
I hate coffee cuz it makes me shit too early in the morning. I don‚Äôt need coffee to be awake
Come on should've picked the choice that some guys are cute! Would've been a lil more interesting lol
28:45 9 yo army !!!there
1:19:27 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the bad guy, duh‚Äù wow billie is quaking
where jackaboy when theres a villain
Topless female and this video isn‚Äôt age restricted...ok
1:34:40 Dutch Van Der Linde that you?
I bet the Creator's use some personal experience or inspiration or inspiration from actual people describing their situations to make the campfire scene because no way they made all that up and I'm this emotional
I feel like Daniel is way way way way way way way too strong right now Mike in any other character that I've seen with telekinesis or any type of form of it he's pretty strong for his age
23:05 Every 12 year old: loOk it‚Äôs bOoooobs
sean is such a bi icon
56:45
I‚Äôm Dane the man and my dad used to drive us around in a mini van
All we need is mONeY - Dutch vanderland
Viking Jack
oh yeah, it is hot as hell in Louisiana, trust me
35:16 were watching Jack/sean Play rule 34
Jack please do another upload of life is strange 2 today please
Consider yourself capped fool
Why is there a topless lady
Is Finn gay?
I just started this episode so idk if this happens or jack makes the choices but I really REALLY want them to go back to Seattle and fuck around with lyla I really miss her lol
When Sean/Jack started singing the wheels on the bus am I the only one who jokingly started head banging?
The Karen who didnt take the kids
wkejfniewfe




like it
I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought Sean speaking Spanish was attractive
Daniel is going to have a moment like how Magneto had a moment when he use that Penny or quarter. Or a moment like Vania when she was fighting with her sister or a moment like Sabrina when she was fighting with her cousin
jus take the risk
I have a theory. Not a good one but. If Daniel has telekinesis, would the other people have powers? And would this be attached to the x men origins?
As a Norwegian, I understood what they were talking about when they started speaking Swedish.
41:07 dEn SiStA pErSoNeN d√Ñr InNe
The birds are from mean
Do you think their related to rosa diaz
39:45 lol
...I somehow thought, Blackflag was mushroom...
1:09:31 Are you talking about yourself or the game?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW HEEEEEEELL YEEEE
16:46 THANK GOD SOMEONE SAID IT
I'm no longer watching these videos because you're terrible weed references this is too cringy to watch
Daniel: I can lift big ass trees with my mind
Max: Hold my time travel mind
Soooo good and been waiting and watching for it..
1:36:27 Oh God, I read that as "nipple hair" not hippy!
he DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABED 
1:36:14
Thank the Lord I am The youngest- I would‚Äôve dropped kick that lil shit if he messed up my aim
I have a feeling that if Brody and Finn met they won't get along and Sean will have to choose sides
You change Jack
My name is Lyla !!
29:24 What she's interested in?
Am I the only one that ships Finn and Sean? At first I was sceptical about Finn and thought he was jealous of Sean because Cassidy liked him. And also because he was too good to be true. The very cynical Hannah praised him and he got Sean a job. I thought he must have had ulterior motives. I also thought him hanging out with Daniel all the time was his way of getting back at Sean for "stealing" Cassidy. But by the end of the episode, I understood that he did all that because he actually liked Sean. Come on Jack, please get them together!
Who the flip names there kid pennywise :O
Yay swedish peaople
Dan the man humanities last stand
1:17:14 when u hit ur toe
NSFW
jack where did you grow up, not a farm? the code is you don't get high on your own supply!
I like how they're free to do whatever they want and view whoever they want and not bother anyone
1:45:38 Did you forget about the consequence of Max's powers? She had to sacrifice Arcadia or Chloe because of the tornado
23:07
the life is strange series has a weird,,, vibe similar to the walking dead and i dont really know why
80% of this video is jack cutting weed and 20% of the game
On god this sounds amazing smoking weed and relaxing in the forest
Finn is the chaotic bi I aspire to be one day
Hmm 8008ies, no demonitization.
..
Im not getting into this game as much as the last. The main characters feel so whiny.
1:09:24 Sean practicing for the annual bottleflip challenge with Felix.
4:29 this song used to be my shit back in like 2007 when the first Spongebob movoe came out üòÇ
Finn was totally hitting on Sean. Cute hahaa
Hannah has a protection rune on her forehead.
Who else who else sang the wheels on the bus go round and round with Jack
Scared me shitless Jesus
Hey
you should watch the outcome for going to bed with daniel, it's really sweet and so much better than the haircut. please choose daniel over the others, you're gonna get a bad ending
Cassidy has talent and I'm sure the others do as well with all of them working together to make a money I'm sure they'd be able to get a beach house and live out finn's dream but that's only if they're all down
I‚Äôm surprised about the lack of tiddy comments
Ingrid is swedish and i tought she was Norwegian cuz she sounded NorwegianüòÇ ¬´i am Norwegian
Anders is Swedish. Yay
1:16:35 Them eyessssssss tho
its been sevEN YEARS....
I like how nobody notices that penny looks like Odell
Thing is I'm an artist and if she were to take it right out of my hand like that I do the exact same he had a perfect reaction
I dont like Cassidy she just seems like the easy choice for a love interest to me i like how finn is funny and not worried about things and if you choice him you may find some inner depth that you would find as much with Cassidy but thats just me
wAIT-- What if danny is the new billy from his happy wheels days?
Enano is Spanish for dwarf
FINALLY!
23:10 wouldn't that get demonetized?
DAAM DANIEL
my grandparents are visiting, and as soon as I read the title I scurried in my room. my mom was like ‚Äúoop, there she goes.‚Äù
my grandparents are visiting, and as soon as I read the title I scurried in my room. my mom was like ‚Äúoop, there she goes.‚Äù
I hope Jack  reloads the checkpoint and goes to bed with Daniel cause Sean new hair it kinda werid no offense Jack
Friggintiddies
1:16:28
Hannah‚Äôs voice actress sounds an awful lot like Chloe‚Äôs same voice actress....???? Or am I losing it
Daniel must have a high midiclorian count
sean is 17 because he is 8 years older than daniel
ingrid got that accent
Meow! :3
Why is the animation so borked though
Without music is the game really boring
David is a jedi night!
Sean: wow judgy!
Also Sean: She's very cynical and jaded
how could u leave behind blackflag like what








i'd rather die than leave my dog behind
Who else started to clap when Sean clapped the Wheels on the bus?
Aye I'm from Louisiana. Absolutely my most favorite play through Sean has done
Finn looks like Floyd from Gta5
i feel like it's the other way around and daniel feels like he's being neglacted  by cassidy.
U late late u ruined my sleep schedule, I stayed up all night for this
I had a bad fucking day jack I watched your videos and smiled and laughed it just made me feel better and happy for once so thank you for all the warming happy content
Bro I just got bought the first one
There plan to get into Mexico is impossible because of the wall
33:56
I would‚Äôve stabbed Daniel if I were there
Only if Sean has powers
he shuold of gone to bed with daniel
If i had to choose Sean's love interest it would be Fin
It‚Äôs my bd today
When sean is telling their story as them being wolves. I wondered why their dog wasnt just a young child because they were dogs so the puppy should have been a human
Is anyone else feeling a bit weird that the nudity wasn‚Äôt sensored?
JACK PLEASE PLAY DON"T STARVE HAMLET
YES MY BROTHERS NAME IS SEAN AND MY NAME IS SARAH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yea, merills is going to die anyways
I love this game but DAMN THE DIALOGUE IS CRINGY

18:39

Dude, Finn looks like Layne Staley from Alice in Chains, awesome
This camp is just one giant communisim place and I want to live there
I WANT SEAN AND CASSIDY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I shit you not, I know exactly where they were camped out in the beginning of the episode!!!
Please make these more  frequent
Go Louisiana my home state meh yeah
Furry confirmed
So jack you had a coke zero in every ep. Now you have a coffee nice
Im no kid i can lift the biggest tree in the world said Daniel. BOIII YOU STILL NINE YEARS OLD BOIIIII said sean
I‚Äôm confused why didn‚Äôt he censor start where he wakes up and goes outside
At least Karen didn't take the kids this time.
Did Anybody Notice That Cassidy Has The Same Earrings As Jackaboy..??
Karen... would you even want to find her with a name like that
It really hit me when he was talking about you know Daniel and how he was always throwing attitude for no reason and then how he asked if he was a bad big brother and then Daniel got jealous LIKE WOAH THE LYLA THING
Don't do weed
Sean and Finn could have kissed, ahhhhhhhhhhh.
Why the hell didn't they replace the copyrighted music with royalty free music lmao
Nobody:

No one in the world:

Jack I DONT KNOW HOW TO CENSOR
Ok but did yall notice Daniel's powers sound effect after he left the campfire?
Episode 5 spoiler James Charles flirts with Daniel
Jack: I am going to leave this episode here
Me: He‚Äôll Nah!!!
Hey Sean are you ready for IT part 2?
1:34:44

Giving me some major ass dutch vibes.
YES HE PULLED THOROUGH I'VE BEEN WAITING AND WANTING!!!!!
It feels like me and Sean are in the game cause I'm Daniel he's Sean
Age Restricted: Not Suitable For Most Users
23:04 IM SURPRISED YOUTUBE LET THAT PASS!!!!!
You say how he talks and yawn at the same time but isn‚Äôt Sean talking to himself in his mind
1:00:28 trying to read the words on his arm
53:01 Sean‚Äôs arm has a spasmüò¨üòÇ
i love how jack doesn't get how important it is for big brothers to be on the good side of a growing little brother cause he is a little brother
Yeeeeeess finally
Anyone think about Brightburn when Daniel uses his power to lift the bottom of that tree out of the water?
Ingrid sounds like Scarlet Witch....

I love how they say everything is ok, even being asexual, and even giving you the option to answer you don't really like dating. Haven't seen that in a lot of (big) games. Just shows that, even when we loose ground in some places, the media/games are there to give support and recognises its a thing. I dunno, it just made me happy seeing the option and hearing that dialogue
1:24:47 yikes forever
At least Karen didnt take the kids here
Somehow there is just no story in this game.

Me: flashbacks to Legend of Zelda

Why did the chicken cross the road 







To end the life‚Äôs of those who eat his fellow chicken brothers
Jack still didn't get his coca cola sponsorship so he was sponsored by KFC instead?
Who‚Äôs idea was to make a game where you play as a really violent ninja chicken...






And why haven‚Äôt I heard of it before!

Putting Assassins Creed, Just Cause, and Uncharted 2 together = Sekiro
0:09- "But not just any old regular Sekiro..." Oh dear. Walking into this blind may not have been the best idea. I think you had some streams of this game, which I missed? (thinks) 
0:19- "I'm a chicken." Well, I never would have thought that you would admit to that... :P By the way, your hero is a handsome Jersey Giant- I think.
- "Who needs to be Sekiro, when I can be Cluckiro?" Imagine attempting to spell that in characters. Wouldn't translate well, I am guessing.
- "Why do you attack?!" You have never heard of a Cock Fight?
End- Not bad. The skin is well made and moves well, as it should. Might go back and watch the regular game later on. This reminds me of Dark Souls.
Roses are red 
Ketchup is too

Answers?
How about... The Buck Fright (since he was referencing The Dark Knight)? Or The Cluck Crusader?
I would like to see you play the whole SoulsBorne series. The series consists of Demon Souls; Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3; and Blood Borne. People are still debating on adding Sekiro to the SoulsBorne series list.

Jack, I watched your Sekiro stream on twitch, but you didn't finish it, is there a part 2 somewhere?
That's a chicken motherf*cker

Like if u get it.
He has the bell demon on, that makes the game a lot harder ( you can tell by the amount of skill points he gets)
Jack : * sees a boy in a cave *
Also Jack: CoMe WitH mE tinY seWEr ChiLd
He was a fine upstanding Bantam Cock
So brisk and stiff and spry
With a springy step and a jaunty plume
And a purposeful look in his eye
In his little black laughing eyes there was...
I took him to the coop and introduced him to
My seventeen wild eyed hens
He upped and he tupped as a hero tups
He bowed to them all and then
He upped and he tupped them all again!
The more I look at it Sekiro looks like a bad dark souls 3 great game

Wtf?
I unsubbed like six months ago.

YT just resubbed me.
If anyone has been chased by an angry rooster as a child...
They know the face of true fear watching this.
They say shinobi are able to transform into animals. This one only became more eerily intimidating when he got stuck halfway through his transformation.

Also, I've always thoroughly enjoyed when Jack plays open-world games and posts highlights and shenanigans from them. It's great fun to watch and good advertisement for the games.
Remember if you see a chicken running up to you
I literally have a chicken sleeping next to me rn
Hey jack please read my comment

I raise chickens. Some of the roosters are actually this ruthless. You need a shield just to feed them. Whoever calls you a chicken for being a coward, say thank you. Roosters are some vicious birds, and they always go for the face.
You now it's been a very long time since you've played Don't Starve. I know you've been busy playing a lot of newer games and setting up other things for the future for us, but Klei has came out with a lot of new things. I wish I could watch you play it again for good times sake.
Take a shot every time he says chicken or makes a chicken joke

Commas are important. For example, compare "Eat that, chicken!" With "Eat that chicken!" Two completely different meanings!
He is the aerodynamic chicken warrior
Cluckin ALL THE WAAAYYYYY
I wanted to make a reference to that giant chicken from Animaniacs, but realized that nobody would get it if I didn't at least mention it's name, Chicken Boo. But the joke about Chicken Boo was always that people never saw through his disguise and thought he was a regular guy, which I can't pretend is the case anymore after having called him by his name, Chicken Boo.
Chicken
Boo
This is the reality vegans want!
Jack you should do a video where you react to everyone joins the battle videos and you are in the newest one

Jack used to remind me of Simon Pegg. Now he‚Äôs Baldur.
Jack you're a potato and that's a compliment
Hey why do the chickens attack you like even without mods is it cause they're giant or something
My brother told me this joke that I felt was appropriate here.
Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to his bitch's house.




Knock, knock.
-Who's there?
THE CHICKEN.
I had a chicken try to take my left eye once. I was 2 or 3 years old at the time, and since then I've had a fear of them.
‚ô´ You should know that a man with the power of nature
Can bring you to the end of your luck
And you should know by my stride and the look in my eye
That you're about to be massively forced to give up!
Chicken attack
Chicken attack
Watch your back before it fades to black

Jack, i have a request for you. Not trying to be dramatic or anything like that but to the people who don't like Religious people, feel free to ignore this comment



Jack please remove your videos where the video contains you using curse words in the same sentence with Religious Words/Names or using Them as jokes or joking about Them. Also where your videos contains subtitles that subtitles Religious Words/Names with lowercases on The first letter

Ah. The chicken. Yes, I know him. Ah, that mighty poultry that killed my wife's brother-in-law's sister's brother's long lost uncle. I hated him anyways. That dang colonel. My dang colonel uncle, always attacking the chickens. Bless that Japan-Irish chicken. Bless him
When is the new Sally Face episode(s) coming out?
Hey Jack, just wanted to say I love your videos and you‚Äôve inspired me in so many of them. I‚Äôm going to be starting my own YouTube channel in the next few months in a different name.

Like so Jack sees!
Jack's cussing has come to an end (I thought when I said that Jack will stop cussing when pigs fly a month ago I knew this would come hoping for winged pork or flying bacon)
hmm lol
Story time: when I was about 7 we had this rooster that was really mean and would chase my cousins and would try to kick people with his spurs. When the rooster would get ready to attack anyone he would like hop from foot to foot really quickly and my dad figured this out relatively fast. So when the rooster would go to attack my dad, my dad would like "punt" the rooster away from him. (Don't worry it never actually hurt the rooster)
What type of jutsu does he use

Well this is the best version of chicken run I ever seenüêìüêî
Hi jack aka sean i have a cute anime game it is called fnia aka five night in anime plz play it well be a cool game wach it on mairusu
Fun fact: if chickens see blood they will  furiously  peck at it. Cannibalism is an actual problem with chicken farms so someone invented red tinted glasses for hens so they wouldn't be able to se the red blood.
hey jack what do you think about attack on titan season 3 part 2?
Full chicken play through?
This Chicken is unstoppable!!!!!!!!!

So you know what to sencer if i spelled it righ i have a little problem of spelling :)
Can you play mortal kombat 11 story please
I must say, I am very PISSED that you didn't do a full play trough of Sekiro!!


Also, 4:17 did Jack finally start swearing again?!
Sekiro...Chicken...Chickiro? Chickeniro? KFCiro?
Chickens never fight huh?
Looks at Cluckiro
Sure...
Chickens don't walk like that, they walk like flamingos. Is that chicken fake? Unless it got mutated & its body structure gone whack. The game looks rad, finally the chicken comes up on top!! üí™üòé. Some breeds can fly, but not like a Peregrine Falcon. Only lift a foot off the ground & glide across a short distance. This vid was still fun, I enjoyed Cluckido, my new friend now XD Keep being awesome bro. üçÄüòéüëä


 Flawless argument XD XD
 XD You don't say XD
 NO!! Dx Dx 
 Nice sound, but sounded a bit strained. Don't hurt yourself.
You should say "Bawk bawk mother Clucker!"
3:17 how we make....

It was at that moment , japan can never see a chicken normally again
cluckiro would literally be chickenwolf... not one-armed chicken
Literally 13 min of jack laughing at the chicken model
Howd you get the chicken mod?? I need it!!!
Why do I find it hard to take this game seriously???
My Head: Its a Human Chicken going around stealth killing people. XD
Jack your Sekiro video was very fowl
Best youtuber
I loved this lmao 

Long live Cluckiro, the greatest warrior to ever live. 

Also can I just say, that I have never and probably will never, understand why so many people demand or constantly bug youtubers to play certain games? Reminding them the game exists is one thing, but demanding or going on and on about it is a completely different thing that I personally feel shouldn‚Äôt happen. Especially with longer let‚Äôs plays and episodic games, time is a factor that can‚Äôt be produced for the benefit from thin air. Constricted time means shorter videos and recording sessions in comparison to something that usually goes relatively unedited and has to be played for upwards of an hour. 

Stop demanding/constantly begging a YouTuber to do a certain video or let‚Äôs play, especially if it takes a large amount of their time to do, and just be happy with the videos you do end up getting from them while they‚Äôre short on time. Or you could even go back and watch older videos from them. It‚Äôs rude to demand more of someone when they‚Äôre already giving you something, be grateful and appreciate what you have.
does this game have a fox skin
seems like kfc delivering the wings to thair homes today
I wanna see an animation of this
Jack can you please make a whole play through of this game I love the game and your commentary is soo funny and I can‚Äôt find anyone else that has played it

Can I have Some fried Chicken Jack
When the Chicken was 2 years later for the Chinese New Year
Who would hate this pure souled lovely irish potatoe gaelic gladiator?
7:19 Fun fact, on the off chance you were curious. Holding a sword by the blade was a real technique, called "Half Swording". In german, it's called Mordhau which translates to "Murder Strike". (Name of the game!) Basically, you'd use the sword's guard like a war-hammer, and smash their armor, giving them all kinds of concussions and other injuries, because plate armor was hard to peirce, but bendable with enough force.

Just some info from a nerd! :P
Seems like u were stuck between a rock and a hard place
Jack, follow these instructions very carefully:
1.  Choose the engineer class.
2.  Equip the lute.
3.  Press 'R'.
4.  Become the happiest man alive.
Jack really is a Hanzo main from the meme image on a previous video.
"I used to be an adventurer like you...then I got stuck in a tree."
10:26 Top right corner
NoobMaster69 isnt just a fortnite god who gets yelled at. He fought wars!

Only an Irishman can hit a target that far !!!  Good on ya lad !!
Jack, Sid Meier‚Äôs Pirates! Would love to see you play it. Please make it happen, I know we would all love it
To be a Mordhua player and watch this is actually painful xD
Turning a sword around is called mordhau (murderstroke) and was used to damage plate armor with a sword (which is usually impossible)
If a player walked past Sean's character it would sound like this
"uuuuuaaaaaaAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHAaaaaaaaaauuuuuuhh"
Robin Hood: ain‚Äôt no other man a better archer than me....

Jack: hold my beard..
Oh War isn't that fun now that you're in the thick of it, is it?
"War is scary" He says
But if you look at him in his TABS vids he gives NO FCUKS Those men give up their lives to fight for your COCA COLA ZERO SUGAR NOW WITH A DROP OF ADDED VANILLA, They have FAMILIES! And look at you now.
You know what Jack? You're a Steven.


That's the best insult I can think of
Holding the blade of a sword is an actual historical thing, you use the guard and pommel like a hammer for armoured enemies
Holding the blade of a sword and swinging it like a mace or blugeon is called half-swording. It's used to break through heavy armor because blades don't do well against metal plates
Read title*
Me: yea I can relate when I play fortnite 








( I suck at the game lol )
Anyone else think the sword was a bow?
When Jack links the wrong game in the description SMH.
Jack: "I'm great for war!"

Immediately gets killed
Literally every team-based game: 5:30
Holding the blade of the sword and using the cross-guard is called the Mordhau (aka the murder-stroke)
*Massive war is ongoing*
Jack: OOOH target practice!
Can you please react to lumpy touch‚Äôs video or videos of garfield gameboy‚Äôd
Does damage that is not team damage


Jack: I'M HELPING SO MUCH!
Sean:
"Everybody in this team are my bestfriends"
*Team kill
Sean:
"..."
Enemy team: Exists


Jack: Picks archer
Also Jack: I'M 'BOUT TA END THIS WHOLE 
jack is the new Atraus from god of war but his weakness is not the rage BUT THE TREE!!!!!
Jack is great archer now he can fit roger in TABS
Like if Jack should play For Honor
Jack: Subscribers, what is your profession?!
Jack's Army: LAUGH! LAUGH! LAUGH!
THE GRIND DONT STOOOPPPPPP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
im great for war im built for it 
random person: reeeeee stab I GOT A KILL
Accidentally stabs his team-mate.
Grudge holding team-mate: Follows and see's him get lowered to 10 hp.
Grudge holding team-mate: Stab
Killed by a grudge. ._.
A little toxic, not gonna lie.
Brah you can gain back all your health by just standing still for awhile
Jack: - shoots teammate -
Me: .....OH WAIT, HE'S COLORBLIND
Think about how awesome this would be in VR
Who else doesn't know any of the games Sean plays

Jack: Hits Teammate
Teammate: We'll get em' next time.
The clickbait...
Man, I've been watching the channel for five years, and I love it. But the recent, crazy amount of clickbait titles is starting to reallyyy grate on me. I get that calling something like, 'I'm so bad at this | Mordhau #1' must get boring, but I sort of feel like the videos have become more, 'throw memes in everywhere, references everywhere, clickbaity titles everywhere' and something just feels different. I don't know. I'm not being rude at all, I love the channel. I'm just seeing things change, and not necessarily for the betterü§∑
Jack why are you so loud 
You should do a ear rape 
Jack:AHHHHHH!

that vehicle is refered as a "hay moped" FYI only differense to a real moped is the shit drop to the ground instead of rising into the sky :P

One question, jack, did you do the tutorial? Its hilarious AF
"I hit him, now run away!"  Me during every pvp game ever. Mad respect

Jack is changing
He's becoming family friendly
What a sellout
What happened to you drumming
Just waiting for life is strange episode 3 from jack.. I refuse to watch anyone else
Holding the sword from the blade was actually a tactic you can find videos about it on YouTube also.
But Jack, sleep is for the weak.
"I wanna yell too!"


Hhhhhhhhhhhh sure Jack, sure
Tree stops Jack in the middle of war
Jack: haha not enough to stop this skillful Archer  getting 4 kills!

What happened to virtually the day it came out?
How to do melee in mordhau? LEARN BLOCKING

Jack: I blocked it!
Jack: Are you having a good day?
Character: shakes head
PLAY LIFE IS STRANGEEEEE
The grind never ever stop I work 105 hours a week
Hey Jack episode 3 of Life is Strange 2 just came out and we want to see you play it all the way through in one video.
8:08 
Jack:Imma get this guy
(Swings and doesn‚Äôt even get close to him)
Jack:Got him!
Shoukd play tutorial it actually funny and can help
Jack when moving: Can't hit anything for shit
Jack when stuck between a tree and rock: Hits everything
Enemy :
Jack ( as a archer ) : im about to end this man's whole career
Sees in description he fought a tree

Me: Why u bully groot
Just so ya know 
Holding the sword by the blade and hitting them with the hand guard/pommel (circle bit at the end of the handle) was a legitimate tactic used across the ages. It was actually effective, because it could be used as a mace to counter enemies with plating. Look it up sometime, it‚Äôs called half swording. 
(There are some great YouTube videos about it)
Love your videos Jack! Keep up the good work
7:29 that is a actual way to fight with some swords, people used the guard on the hilt to jab out a knight's eye
Is this pure MP or is there single player?
Gets hit by an axe 
Barely half hp
Punches a guy with bare fist
106 Damage
Sean and his bro (I don't remember the name) need u
Like so he could seeüëçüëç
Congrats on being 23rd to Trend!
Bro, what computer specs do you have if you can upload a video and play a game like that at the same time. I need the deets
Jack play life is strange 2 episode 3
The sound effects made the video way worse.
"I AM GREAT, I AM BUILT FOR WAR." 1 sec later, oooof
If Jack didn't play the tutorial and pass the Hans Test, it's no wonder he wasn't familiar with the combat too much. Hope he picks it up though, cleaving heads is satisfying.
Well if a septic eye makes you that accurate with a bow and arrow, then sign me up!
7:22 that‚Äôs called half-swording. It‚Äôs when you are fighting a guy in heavy armor so you use your handle like a mace or club because your blade won‚Äôt do anything.
‚ÄúThe grind never stops‚Äù
Jack‚Äôs comment which can be taken either way 2019
Hey Jack I was watching Your drum video And was just curious Why did you stop making Drum videos
Been watching callmekevin have you üòâ

Jack when are you playing through  LIS2 Ep3??
Our branches will blot out the sun
Jack:
We‚Äôll fight in the tree
Squatting repeatedly in a videogame is the purest form of communication there is; change my mind.
Is this just For Honor plus Battlefield because goddamn it's good
7:30 Jack. Sorry to disappoint. But that's an actually a very nice touch from the developers and an effective technique against armor.

Since the blade of a sword is just gonna glance off plate armor, a person with only a sword has 2 (effective) options against full plate:

-What you see here. It's essentially a makeshift mace. (Edit: It's called "murder stroke". "Mordhau" in german)

-"Halfswording" When you grab the blade of the sword with one hand to gain greater control over the tip and try to jam it in the gaps of the armor.


Great video tho.
Call Me Kevin calls his long lost brother Jack

Both armies runs away
Lmao Jacksepticeye is the best archer... When he's stuck in a tree üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ I so wanna see more of this, Sean!

Jack learned about half-swording~
Now un-screw the pommel and kill them.
HOLY SHIET JACKABOI PLAYED MORDHAU!?!?!
Gripping your sword by the blade and striking with the guard is called Mordhau.
This game feels like a clunkier Chivalry :O
I find it hilarious that I was smoking and coughing when he started coughing ask said dont you know smoke is bad for your health üòÇ

Something seems different about the video idk what it is but It feels different to me üòÇ
Jack you should try the Battle Royale mode or Horde mode for streams so your fans could play with you and protect you as their king. After all, who wouldn't want the GAELIC WARRIOR as their KING!

in the old days europian thought holding the blade of the sword instead of handle and punching was the best attack because doing that does heavy damage

chirvary v2 and mount and blade
Life is strange 2 episode 3!
A steady blade balances the soul
Seems like Jack may need to retake the Hans tests.
You know I remember the very fist video I ever saw by you. "Dying Light Hardcore Parcore" I even remember the thing you said in it that just made me laugh so much that almost made me pass out. 
zombie slaps Jack

Jack: That'll stop me. It's cause Susie hit me in the face. I can't do it when someone slaps me in the face."
I don't know what was so funny about that, but I was laughing so hard my mom thought I was having a panic attack. If anyone can make me laugh that hard it's you Jack. I love you, keep the amazing videos going. I will never get tired of watching them.
The guys name was dillan the hacker yt
Was that a 
Bruh sound effect
Men can multitask just as good as women, a Florida man was high on meth and fought off fifteen cops all while master-bating. Talk about multitasking.üòÇ
Best vid ever

Play life Is strange 2 eps 3
I think Roger is not going to be happy with you Jack!
Jack why are you not playing tabs anymore
Jack Septiceye the Helpful
Nice LoTR reference Jack, nice.
V X C is for emotes
Jack when they yell at you you yell back
Hey they incorporated  murder strokes, cool.
holding the blade of the sword instead of the handle is a real technique called halfswording jack, you do it so you can bash peoples skulls with the pummel.
you can throw the pommels of longswords
this is actually so fun jack!
Jack the great archer stuck on a tree never miss a shot but he sometimes hes teammate
Yes the intro nice poney tail there boy
Teo also got stuck in the same tree lol
Okay listen up, everybodu√Ω in the Mordhau community knows that shieldbearers and archers are the no-go zone. Ya just don't do bows or shields if you don't wanna be discriminated by the chat. Since you're new imma give you a pass but next time I expect some chambering and sword fighting.
U r videos suck n- Oh. Oh no. This is terribly awkward. This was going on an enemy video. Damned friendly fire!

9:47 vietnam warrior in battle
Thanks for checking out Mordhau Jack I figured you'd like it dunno why but I had some sort of vision of you playing it 
I had to create a twitter account for my current YT handle to pass on the message of Mordhau...
Of course these 2 weren't the maps I saw you in the dream it one of the other ones (I think it was that map with the thatched houses you was invading the cast through the door!) but it's funny in the dream it was a bow I saw you using so I guess it was predetermined and possibly fated that you would be an archer

Not sure why I received a premonistic vision about you playing a game 
usually they are visions of foreshadowing threats 
nice to know my clairvoyant dreams don't just foretell bad things

I may even see you in game!
if your ever on london server
Bring back the DRUMS
At 10:52 jack is actually SOOO adorable in this part ahah u don‚Äôt care what ANYONE says üòäüò©üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

Wow Sean, great job with this video this may become a classic.
Haven‚Äôt watched Jack in months, tf happened
Fun fact, flipping a sword around and striking with the handle/pommel of a sword is known as a murder strike. it adjusts the balance of the sword and is good for attacking heavily armored individuals.
More of this would be lovely
this is hilarious
Please take one video where you only talk irish

Jack, holding the blade of a sword is called halfswording, and the handguards guards could be used to penetrate enemy armour better than the blade could.

If Sean was an Immortal like in Highlander he would get his head cut off before even finding out he was immortal. But if Immortals used bows in place of swords he would be the only one left standing.

Holding your sword by the blade and swinging it is called half swording which is used to be effective against enemies wearing armor
Do more mordua videos jack plzzzzzzz

Sean, 2 guys in full iron armor are dueling. They both got a sword. The pointy part doesnt go through the armor. But you know what does? A hammer. Well. Since those longswords are 1.7 metres amd the handle is as heavy as half the blade. Dont you think it make a great warhammer when you hold it upside down? ;)
I haven't seen this channel in so long, that I just saw Sean w/ his man bun. I feel loke a loser.üòêüòí

Hey jack brigands are normally kept in the back for the benefit of distance.(Archers)
When you turn the blade around like that in the Mordhau grip, you use the cross guard and/or pommel as a makeshift hammer in order to fight enemies in armor, where blunt force would be more effective

ie. Mace
I‚Äôve killed so many team mates cause I tried using the ballista
I thought Jack was playing mordhau not subnautica blow zero
You should play HOME on steam (its free!) its kinda cute and cool.
Plz play more this was fantastic

Quote from Jack 2019


"Killing people feels great"
Hunter The Call of the Wild please series üòÅüòÅ
7:17 nobody hit you at the last second but the footman perk is when the enemy hit hard and it look like you died but you didn't died it mean you have 5 second to attack back before you died by bleeding and to know if you activate the Perk (by itself if enemy hit hard) you will heard a scream from you not your team
Is this the recording or the upload?
That was delicious. ANOTHA!!
Jacksepticeye didn‚Äôt help the fight.

Jack they all good Brigand is not bad i watch people use them and got so many kill without getting hit except arrow the strongest damage is the Brigand and the most defensive (and strong i think) is Protector i think you can block any way with Protector unlike the sword need to block left side, right side, up but shield? it like block every side

I'm going to be completely honest I didn't watch this video in fact Ive spent all day thinking about what to write in this comment and well I just went back and rewatched undertale recently and it made me think of how you changed over these last few years and I might not watch your videos as frequently as I used to I still am a huge fan and still get Getty nostalga every time I go back to one of your Happy wheels videos and I really have grown up watching your videos and thank you if it wasn't for me watching your videos I would be the bright positive Getty optimistic person i am today so once again thank you
I nfifj

Hey Jack I have a request. Can you make red dead redemption 2 videos. The game has snowy forest as a biome. The game is longer then god of war I think?
Some veteran or person in the army is watching this in their off time and they're just looking at jack like. Pfffttt amateur.
That was a hell of shot! Way to go Jack!
@Jacksepticeye .  Bruuuhhhh!

Its The Last of Us meets I Am Legend
19:36

"Stop Yelling At Me"

Says the guy who yells his intro AND outro AND is loud. lol. 

LOVE YA JACK!
Nobody:


Absolutely no one:



Jack: 
The spirit of Roger has possessed you. You now have wicked sniping skills
Proud of your archery skills, Tree Jack
This gameplay is believable, jack was a former battlefield 3 pro player
You are now fighting for the independence of Ireland
Obviously that tree chose you to defend it from those who might cut it down by literally rooting you to the spot and imbuing the wooden shafts of your arrows with the power to fly straight to the heads of any human who might pose a threat to either of you.

Obviously. :)
You can tell jack has never played chivalry
There is no such thing as multi tasking only task switching
JAAAAAAAAACK, plz play more!
he should play woody woodpecker
Plez play more
Hi jack I know you love spider man but I want to ask you if your going to watch the new spider man movie bye now I love your videos

When is Life is Strange coming back
DO SLIME RANCHER AGAIN!!!!!!
How do you upload a video while recording one? You must have the best internet. If I try upload everything else will run like ass.  And it would take probably 20 hours to upload a 20 minutes video. That's how bad my internet is...
Hey jack!
Remember the game called "my friend pedro" it's coming out soon
PLAY IT!
This title and thumbnail idea reminds me of someone


Also when jack got stuck is when good shit happens
He does better when he's stuck by a tree than moving around.
please play and record the tutorial its hilarious and also useful
Jack was lookin like a worrier and a sea full of warriors
This whole video was it Jack was in a GOT episode! Lol
You should make a DND character called death bow, he's a god at archery, but has an irrational fear of not touching trees
JACK when someone grabs their blade and attacks with the hilt, THAT is literally a Mordhou, or "murder stroke", hence the name. Made to bludgeon or penetrate with the crossguard.
I haven't watched JSE in a while. wHow, he's changed
New god of war weaknes not rage but the TREE TA DA DAAAA
I imagine if there is a war while jack was young he would do this when he was drafted
there is no i in team, but there is an m and an e
Jack u need to play danger zone that game like Minecraft

Jack i have discovered a game that I think you will like and find really interesting. It‚Äôs a mobile game (I know that may put you off). It‚Äôs a mystery/puzzle solving game based during an apocalypse and it is called ‚ÄúThe Silent Age‚Äù. It‚Äôs one of the games your calmer self would play.
Let me Just  BRUH

 Jack and Robin 2019
Start of video 
Me: "Are you a Roger or a Steve?"
Jack wonders around, no clue what he's doing. He quite often kills his allies. He bad some random epic moments of redemption.
Me: "Yep. Definitely a Steve."
*kills teammate
Jack : "I'm helping !"
this is a better version of  chivalry
Jack, for the love of god, play this game more.
3:20 
Did anyone else hear 'bruh' as Jack died?? Please say it's not just me.
loved the memes! xD
Now the real question. How to find a Jack in the haystack that is all the servers?
You think that is multi tasking I am eating a burger while watching this  and I am playing a video game.üòé
I really love this, I hope there'll more of this :3
Jack remember to block
7:31 you hold a sword like that to use it as a blunt weapon and blugeon them to death
I like archery too
U can get perfect shot becasue you are Jack hood
Please play life is strange S2 pt 3 !!
More!!!
13:37 lolsorandom
Jack I know you won‚Äôt see this but your my favorite YouTuber and you expired me to do stuff that I thought I couldn‚Äôt do so what I‚Äôm saying is thx
Jack you know life is strange episode 3 came out right? You need to play
1:18 i fought that was a bow.
xD LOL LMFAO am i right?
Jack, you should play Rainbow Six Siege
Jack, when you hold the sword by the blade and hit people with the pommel it's an historical technique, called mordhau (or in english, the murder stroke)! You were literally doing what the name of the game is xd
Do more of this please. It's great watching you play it.
Jack: I'm great for war! 




gets killed immediately
You hold it upside down (half swording) for armored enemies. It doesn't cut your hand if you hold it well. Moreover they are wearing gauntlets.
"Above all the people i could hit, i hit my teammates" - jacksepticeye 2019
"killing people feels good"
Jack-2019
Jack you don't get up close to the enemy with a polearm it is there to keep your enemy's away
Plz jack plz..... make another vid this was the best battle game as of now and you are the funniest fighter ever
9:45 

The birth of a new Treebeard.
In class I am doing a project for a country I picked Ireland
I know this comment is on every mordhau video but holding it by the blade is a historicly accurate technique for dealing with armour
I used to think that I would be the safest person going into battle with the Gaelic Gladiator... but now I'm not so sure
Telling jack to play Spider-Man dlc until he does it day 24
Pleas play more of this.
7:18 To hold the sword reversed by the blade is the technique this game is named after, "Mordhau" which is directly translated into "murder-strike". It was used against opponentsi metal armor to bash with the sword more like a mace as cuts arn't effective against an opponent in full armor.
Play more
Again again AGAIN!!!! hell yaaaaa warr with Jack
Another episode of life is strange came out please play it
Play fallout 76 please

0:49- "Are you?" No. :( Today has sucked in a major way. I didn't get much done at work, my self-worth is very low, and I had a panic attack earlier. I really hope that your day is much better and that the loading screen isn't making you think about bad stuff that may have happened to you in your past.
1:01- "Game crashed!" Well, that isn't conducive to making videos. Come on game! Sit up and fly straight, whydon'tya?
- You did it! And with no front end at all.
- "We have this nice elk- er, elm tree." :P Thanks to Robin, we have both.
- "If the Earth is actually really flat, how do you explain all of these rocks and bumps?" (Thinks about explaining surface typography, then decides against it.)
I wonder what he's like in Mario Kart?! üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üëçüëçü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô

"An elk is a moose"
No..no jack, a moose is a moose and an elk is an elk xD
9:21
Why did it take me a few seconds to register that the elk wasn't actually part of the loading screen, even after it bounced away?
7:50 (jack) that tree won‚Äôt save you now
7:55 jack crashes into said tree saving the driver
Jack: ok he went left this time

"I think that's the sound of my car"

"What the absolute f*ck am I doing?"
Rub butter on them?? i was thinking more like oil but that also works ;)

Cars with the second gauge are boosted, so they might need more revs at the start so start in neutral 

Brake before corners, go to the outside, then in, and back out. Compromise if theres a string of corners right after the othsr

okay soo... ryan reynolds is in detective Pikachu AS Pikachu, so my question is DID ryan Reynolds ask warner brothers to bring jack into it because jack is amazing or did they just see that jack and ryan had such good charisma?

JACK NOOOOO DON'T WASH YOUR HANDS OVER THE HAND WASHING STATION. YOU'RE TAINTING IT. You're supposed to scoop water, back up a step, and pour it into your hands for a rinse over the drain, not directly into the fountain.
I feel like jack changed into a judo sensei with that new haircut





Not trying to be mean either
R.I.P. Other camera 20XX - 2019 We will miss you other cameraüôÅüôÅ

Jack. Im proud of you. But also.. sometimes I'm confused.
What ever happened to the cabin, blue hoodie and flat cap?
What ever happened to "SPEEEEEEEED IS KEEEEEY"? 
I'm happy you've grown up and everything and you're happy where you are now.
But in my eyes, the moment when I started watching you.. I already thought you were the perfect youtuber.
awe so cool! I loved this! Looks like you guys had such an awesome time! lol How many of those action figures did you end up buying? 

I've wanted to go to Japan for the longest time myself. Hope I'll be able to someday!

Robin is best boi, this is only him at 2% of his true power
Oh jackaboi you‚Äôre amazing and hilarious

The first thing i saw in 21:28 was McDonald's and I was thinking of Shushi burgers
We're not going to talk about Tim almost killing charizard.
Sean is so adorable
you can tell Robin stepped it up on this video, he's always great but this is a resume builder <hint-hint Warner Bros>
JACK HAS NEW GF ALREADY?!?!? :o
Couldn't you have put Ryan on the vid?
Jack you missed so many chances
On the boat when you were having a dance party a YouTuber was sitting next to you
My girl would FLIP seeing all the Totoro stuff.
I love when jack is happy it makes me happy and the girl with jack (I forgot her name) I ship them together they soooooo cute
Love how 1 year ago on 12th May 2018, 

Sean said: "I'll see you in a year. Train!"
Today on 11th May he did see him lol.
Only 1 day early.
Every time I wach his videos it makes my day when its bad you just laugh it out.
this is one of his first vlogs without Signe and it‚Äôs making me sad : (
that japanese guy at 23:36 lmao
HI MOM
Who would think that guy in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in Ireland would be flown to Japan by the Warner Bros and meet the cast of Detective Pikachu and even playing Deadpool with the actor who played Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds I feel like I've grown up along with Jack on his amazing adventure
Don't apologise! This is awesome!
Robin is amazing at editing
Godzilla vs Pikachu

Have you seen that Sean has a Man ponytail
Different colored eyes. Amazing.
Jack in a temple:
Walks around respectfully and quietly, does everything basically right.
Butttttttt. When you were taking the cup hand washing thing, you shouldn‚Äôt put the water back inside the main place... you wash ur hands outside the stone. Which made me go ‚ÄúNO‚Äù but I think you‚Äôre fine. It just takes the purpose of those ‚Äúsanitary‚Äù stuff away.
MY FAV COUPLE!!!
Good thing someone can keep up with Japan vlogs.....Max
22:27 how the hay-
I leave Jack for 2 years and now he has a ponytail, his ears are pierced and he has a beard. WHAT IS THIS but i like
"See you in a year"
Jack is already on a first name basis with Ryan Reynolds
Can you plz dye your hair green. Thx
Oh god he looks like my Irish neighbor who makes his house as a pub every sunday.
awww I love seeing Jack so happy! Also Robin's editing skills are absolutely amazing they get better with every video! <3
Jack in Japan: Crazy Irish guy in "Far from Home"
Thank you for such a wonderful video. I've always wanted to visit Japan so this was awesome. I felt like I was really there. So cool that Ryan remembered you, Jack.

Ahh japan the city of anime
Robin, you are such an amazing person and editor. The edits feel professional, you timed the picture shots with the music, and one of my favorites was day 2 when jack spun around and seemlessley transitioned to the elevator. And you are such a joy to watch in videos, you have such a great additude and humor and get along great with Jack, I am so happy to have you on the channel

I'd like to say
damn what I would give to be one of those asians by jack rn
Does jack like jojo?
Jack is hot in formal
I love the Japanese styled music throughout the video and also on the end screen too.
The funny thing is were i live most kids who like anime will be abused and  made fun of.

We couldn't have ever asked for a better editor
Anybody else wondering if jack visited a hentai shop?
Well atleast he didnt vlog in a specific forest didnt he?
Sean is so gray üòÇ
An Irish YouTuber being a good boy in Japan

An American A$$hole Logan Paul disrespecting people
That was bloody brilliant! I hope you guys enjoyed every moment!
The best vlog so far...
Is it fair to say you look like the Irish version of Ryan
You should vlog a little more. This video was absolutely awesome! By the way you two are adorable together!
Jack: this is the most anime place I've ever been to in my life
Me: I WANNA GO TO JAPAN!!!!
I am literally in Japan for study abroad right now üòÇ and I had the chance to see jacksepticeye? I‚Äôm so sad now üò≠
15:58 I think Yabai means bad.
He sort of looks like Dr. Strange
7:20 isn't that ando/unlistedleaf in the back?
22:35 Se√°n dancing, thank me later
Where are the subtitles?????
If you like dragon Ball and anime like
When you like other people comments because you can‚Äôt get a heart
Everyone: "Jack schould get coca cola sponsorment"
Noone: "Jack should getinvited to Detective Pikachu Cast"
Girlfriend??
That elevator transition was cool as all hell. 13:59.
4:58 is that the pokemon YouTuber @unlistedleaf
2:27 Ooh he staring
I just imagine Sean speaking Irish in Japan. That‚Äôs all I have to say here. Now I shall take my leave.
jack its looks like ur putting to much hard work in to it but its ok just be yourself!!!!!!!
The gray hair is starting. JACK YOU OLD MAN!
(16:53) Hi Hal!
13:17 that award winning smile
You guys looked great on the Pikachu tail carpet and you could see just how happy Sean was, esp when Ryan remembered him. 
I'd love to see you guys do another video together. 
Also an idea, maybe get your name tattooed on the Japanese characters, as your name looked very cool. Just an idea. 
Thanks for sharing this with us! Missed the vlogs!
Sean and Evelyn are sooooo cuuuuters
I loved this video I think Jack is very good at vloging he‚Äôs not just a pro gamer but he‚Äôs also a pro vloger
May 12th 2018 Jack put out his interview with Ryan Reynolds where they played deadpool and he joked saying see you in a year; flash forward almost EXACTLY a year and he posts this; haha kind of funny xD
honestly evelyn and jack are so damn precious
A fue years back jacksepticeye was just some guy in a cabin in the woods who recorded vidios because he liked it now he has talked to deadpool aquaman and been on a tv show and now has walked the "red" carpet that is a amazing transition
if you get ryan Reynolds in another video, you should play a pokemon game
Who else remembers turbo dismount
Do I spots a Simon and Martina!!!?
Everyone is talking about Ryan or the difference between home jack and japan jack


And I‚Äôm sitting over here singing the Pok√©mon theme song with my 11 stuffed Pok√©mon
11:51 Jack‚Äôs dancing and the girl didn‚Äôt even care.
amazing. so glad ryan recognized you, even a year later. it looks like you had a great day.
I am proud of you, I hope he gives you a big tour of everybody.
It would be on point if Sam broke out of the tube at the end, but maybe it would be a bit spoiler-y
You two are a great couple.
Wait wait wait YOUR cheating on me
Had to rewind 3 times to see.. Simon & Martina‚Äôs in the vlog!!! üòçüòç
Evelyn looks like Morena Baccarin meeting Gal Gadot.
So pretty and elegant!
why no 4K jack
I feel like Jack is slowly evolving in the yoga instructor that your wife cheats on you with.
Is that a DJI camera?
Her ex husband must be watching this like "she's already sleeping with him daaamn."
jack camera VS felix camera
nobody :



jk rowling : jacksepticeye and pickachu had a intense sexual relationship
You should not have shown your tatooes in Japan...
i wish u mentioned natsu
too much anime
I also wish I could find a guy just like Sean tears
Tag yourself. I'm the dude in the background with the :o face at 23:45
20:26 omg is that UnlistedLeaf in the background ^w^
Nice bullet time shots...
Magicarp taiyakiiii :9 21:36 A wild Simon and Martina appears!
They're so cute üòçüòçüòçüòç
Man,robin's edits are so awesome and are getting better and better keep it up pixlpit you too jack!‚ù§

2:59 Jeanne de arc!!!
I was so drunk on the boat cause i was talking to ryan to cuss at the movie of Pokemon
All i saw was detective pikachu
I'm so proud and happy for Sean and how far he's come since the cabin in the woods! He and Evelyn look like they're having fun! I'm so glad!
this is so beautiful video!!
Are you guys dating???
lmao, jack your so short xD
Did he fall in the koi pond!?üòÇ
Those S13 models at 3:33
What if the black goku is goku black.
I would love to go to Japan
4:57 is that UnlistedLeaf I saw behind Jack
Holy guacamole Evelyn is so freakin cool! üíú Sean's cool too I guess üòâüòÅ
More Japan vlogs
The amount of times Jack's eyes light up in this makes me tear up because I love seeing the people I've grown attached to so happy
God i already love evelyn!
A N I M E
üò≠ your growing up so fast I remember when you were vlogging your horse at your old old house, and now your waving at celebrities üò¢ ur da best Jack
I wish if I could meet Ryan Reynolds like that. It would be cool.
You are so freaking lucky
9:59 I couldn't have kept a straight face if that happened to me. I¬¥d lose my freaking chimichangas....
She's so cute with the glasses omg
My dream place to visit...


Also, How could Ryan forget the person who had to show him how to be Deadpool...
Jack looks quite a bit like Ryan Reynolds in 16:50, just saying
heard the forests there were to die for Cx
Wohoo you have grey hair
Unlistedleaf in the background at 4:58 had me shookith
Japan looks so nice! 
14:12 Whhhhhoa, I just had visceral flashbacks to walking that same exact path over a decade ago. Like, I remembered it so hard, my brain hallucinated the scent of the place. Neat. 
I would sell a kidney or two, maybe even a spleen, to go back to Japan. Did you guys go to Nijo Castle? :o Easily one of my favourite places.
unlistedleaf is that you man at 20:22
JAck, how's the song in 14:00 called? I really liked it
Hey
18:32 WHAT??!?!?! You're a wizard, Robin, you're a goddamn wizard.
Why did I think the hat was photoshopped from the pikachu backpack 1:28
I think I went to Japan at the same time you did! My friend wanted to chuck the pikachu in Akihabara in the ocean because it wouldn't stop talking xD
20:10 anyone notice that girl waving in the background? :3
What was that dance üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You see, at first, people see Jack as an energetic ball of yelling and curse words. Then you realize he's just a giant famous child
Don't pull a Michael Scott and step on a koi! lol
Jackalynn 2019
Unlisted Leaf, damn
Dat yellow carpet dance was so cringe tho
The editing in this video üëåüèªüëåüèª 

Top notch 
Good job bois
Oh how i envy you Jack...
7:27 unlisted leaf (Pokemon YouTuber) between them
Do you think jack and ryan are subscribed to each other
The endingüòÇ
Jack walks into the temple, Dark Souls music plays and Boss Life Bars appear before him.
who else thought jack was totally wasted on the cruise
I've always wanted to go to Japan
I need to know exactly which buildings they are at! I want to do that tour so bad and go broke at the anime store buying Pok√©mon plushies!
Jack: includes paid promotion
Me: üò≤üò≤üò≤ Did he finally get sponsored by Coke?!?! reads description 
Also me: sees that its not sponsored by Coke Oh hail nah! sees its sponsored by Warner Brothers Oh ok. That's not as good but... ü§∑
This made me so happy!
Evelyn left to do all the camera work while Jack dances on a carpet. The people in the background looked at him like he had three heads and a tail.
hes probably in akihabara
Omg every time I see Jessie Paige I get so excited lmao
Please don't do anything crazy in Japan




 Suicide Forest 
Literally the coolest.
Fun Fact: the two Japanese writing languages are Hiragana and Kanji!
everyone is pointing out about jack or ryan

me trying to have a good time watching the video < me also trying not to giggle at Sean's height
I don't want to steal Sean's thunder
(shouts over shoulder) "You're doing amazing sweetie"
But DAMN that editing is good!


Robin deserves standing ovations for this one!
The monster cafe reminded me of A Weird Place from AH. Haha
Jack reminds me of Joseph seed from farcry 5
Sean‚Äôs pickachu looks like a joltean
Best part is that its nearly been over an year since Sean did the video with Ryan. He uploaded the video on May 12th and at the time this was uploaded it was May 11th. Kind of wild timing lmao.
This is definitely your best video yet!

Also, you and Evelynn look cute together üòç
So jealous!
Awesome stuff
Have you forgotten about your old friend Pedro
looks like you're enjoying life! I don't wanna be grim, but have fun while you can so you have precious moments to remember when you can't.
I bet that Japanese vloggers camera can't even hear them and it only picks up Sean lmao  7:27
Dude the movie is insane
At 5:05 you can see unlistedleaf in the background walking behind him, noice
Bruh you where always like 17 mins away from me face palm also I just went to Japan for my birthday
But didn't you play games with him?
Manga: 17:47
Anime: 17:56
Netflix Adaptation: 17:52

Edit: thank you for the likes! You're all awesome
loved the one punch references
Jack is one of those people who's been so genuine since the beginning. It sounds cliche but so many youtubers do change when they grow, and while it's not always a bad thing, it isn't always a good thing. Jack is one of those people that's always stayed true to his core and has never used his influence to hold himself above other people. He's still just as relatable, lovable, and humble as ever. Here's to you, Jack. Still my hero since the beginning <3
Hey am i the only one who instanly thought when he said hes going down takeshita street they thought "take shita"
Can anyone tell me the music in this vlog? Preferably that Japanese trap one that was dope. Amazing video tho
Jack should make another video with Ryan Reynolds
20:15 Tales from the click ? Is that you ???
Oh my goodness its so cool that ryan remembered you!!!!!!!!!!
also, why isn't anyone talking about how beautiful jack's eyes are
Robin going crazy with the editing skills
11:50 when you had too much to drink
Why no pika-dance-
Samurai Jack, gotta get back!
My boy is japan  without me
Sean and Evelyn (if that‚Äôs how you spell it) are so happy together it‚Äôs making my heart melt üò©üíû
1:15 WOAH THAT IS JAPAN?!
Jack meeting celebs and in Japan, COOL
Boss!!!
the samurai and the kawai ribbon on the head girl
When Jack showed us Evelyn he was so proud. UwU
TAKE ME WITH YOU!
Great work sean i have been with u since u had 10 million subs and i just think u have been doing a great job
I hope you had a wonderful time!!! Japan is so beautiful!! I can't wait to visit, thanks so much for sharing this tranquil adventure.
Land√≥ was in the back
I was in tokyo at the same exact time as you! I probably walked right past your group in Asakusa and was like "ugh tourist groups" Haha 
Super cool video! Love the content~
What's the stabilising camera that Jack is using called ?
The hell Robin 18:31 what is this editing.
0:14 hitori bochi lol
Can I see Shibiya Plzzzz
This is quite possibly the bubbliest, happiest video I‚Äôve seen of Sean in forever. I can‚Äôt stop grinning. He‚Äôs such a happy dude and it makes me endlessly happy to see him having so much fun.
At least he‚Äôs respectful to the culture not like Logan Paul
Idky but it makes me so damn happy to see this man having a blast. Also i thought i wanted to go to japan and now i need to gl for at least a little. Its so damn pretty T-T i gotta see it
20:29 you have unlisted leaf in the back
Robin did an OUTSTANDING job with this video!!! truly my editing sensei!!
is it just me or is jack growing grey hair (no offense)
You need to buy a tripod that can also act as something you can use to hold your camera
Man I can,t tell if this video has paid promotion
Watch black butler
Robin is a great editor 
Pixlpit: Hold my editing equipment
Why does Evelyn look like Mr. Beast
Why does it look like Jack's grey
Wow Almost No One seed anything about Unlished leaf
I fear death, but not for the pain it will bring me.
    But for the pain it will bring others
I fear death, but not because of those I will miss. 
    But for those who will miss me.
    I fear death, but not death itself, I fear death
          But not because of what will happen to me 
          For I fear death, because of what will happen 
To others

You got a point at the end: a meme a day keeps the sadness away. Memes do keep me from feeling depressed. Maybe not all the time, but most of the time. Heehee.

What happened to Green hair Jack üò¢
Jack: Welcome back to some more memes! The only cure to our problems!
Me: ... Incorrect!
Jack: What?
Me: Your videos, and really you, are the cure to mine! I'm angry? Jacksepticeye! I'm sad? Jacksepticeye! I have to run a mile? Don't ask how, but Jacksepticeye!
Jack: ...
Me:  You're just that amazing! As an award, 
Jack: Huh?
Me: A sword powered by PMA! The Jacksepticsword!
Jack: Okay!
Me:

Jack a Boy‚Äôs picture is better
Jack: ‚ÄúAnd here on the JackSepticEye variety channel we have zero tolerance to violence.‚Äù

Blue light: ‚Äúdid you forget how I got broken?‚Äù

There were more gay jokes than usual this video
13:33 Subtle beating the dead horse there Robin üòâ
Nani???
Jack did it better
Jack: "What if we made just a god-awful movie. Just the worst special effects you could ever imagine, but on a multi-million dollar budget. It's so bad that it will outrage fans and even people who aren't really into the movie's character. Not one of those, "So bad it's good" kind of movies, just a steaming pile of absolute trash."
If that was Jack's idea, then yes, they stole his idea.
Goes from scared boy to scared man that has no idea what there doing now scared viking that has no idea what there doing.
I just saw twitter and Ethan said that YOU stole his idea :P And then someone replied it that Ethan stole Mark's Idea :P I GUESS THE WAR HAS BEGAN!!!!
I VOTE JACK
Some how when you were doing the scared boy to man who does not know what he is doing pictures, you were comaring yourself to Aquaman.
Jack it's Lampy
Love for red light.
I would definitely vote for Jack's image because he had no CGI involved (i mean yeah the other was a movie but I mean, really?) and it was in much better quality.

For some reason the Rift didn't record the same way as the Vive does so it looks like I'm constantly looking down at the ground.
The video was fun though so I didn't think I should scrap the whole thing. Apologies if it's hard to look at

Plays any horror game: 95 BPM

Me over here thinking that if I did the crab rave, I'd get too overwhelmed and then looking at Jack almost nailing it, I was surprised and then I remembered... He was a drummer. 

And that's how I lost hope
Here, we see the Gaelic Gladiator in his natural habitat. Training for his next great battle in the Arena

Jack a tip from someone recording with a rift. Put on smooth camera in the settings in Beat Saber. It will help a lot, trust me.
they need to have pirates of the Caribbean music
He was a boy that didn't know what he was doing.
Then he was a man that didn't know what he was doing.


But now...


Now he's the EPIC GAMER, THE GAELIC GLADIATOR, THE SON OF VIKINGS.
THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE LEGEND.


We love ya Jack :D
I love this
It's a shame the camera is pointed slightly downwards and it's SO r/MildlyInfuriating
Can't see shit capt'n
Rum'n'bass - Boomkitty preview
Jack: It sounds like you're going into the war! (Me: No)
Jack: I guess it's a pirate song (me: Yes)





Later: Jack:  (Me: So Jacksepticeye is a pirate, what a secret)
13:33 i know that song. Till its over   i heard that song from Just Shapes and Beats.
<edit> its also a camputer or console game
9:35 
Jack : Stay perfectly still
Also Jack: moves semi offscreen
When the video just started his heart rate is over 100. Wow.
Jack "But this isn't intense anyways"
Heart: RISE MOTHERFUDGER
Jack: plays beatsaber
Life is strange 2 ep 3: am i a joke to you?
Me: jack play the FrIkInG  episode!
I'm glad you uploaded a vid tho.
hey jack i think you are good at this game because you are good at drumming!
Jack play the San theme this song is for pros only are you sure you can handle it?
Life is strange 2 episode 3 just came out today Jack...
This is how Jack do the crab rave in Beat Saber. 4:30 Highlight of Jack getting a lot of heart beats
Can Jack please do an 80's style jazzercise video?
If you like the new one better you should sign your old one and do a give away
147 bpm seem A LITTLE unhealthy...
Seans resting heartrate is 150. My man never stops
And then I realised HOW MUCH Jack moves. Jesus I'm gonna be sick LOL
Please use the Camera+ mod, would make everything greater üòÑ
why did you start with 156 when you started the game xD
Jack you should play just shapes and beats its and awesome game
Jack wearing a black shirt on a black background
Camera autofocus: AAaaaAaaaAaaAAAAhhhhhhHhhHhh
Jack there is a spotify beat saber playlist if you ever want to listen to the songs

Please like so jack can see
Love this jack but can you do the song Rockefeller street nightcore
"I wanted you to see how intense this game is."
Monitor before gameplay: 150

Holy crap. Even Jack's heart is constantly screaming.
Nobody:

Jacksepticeye using Rift:
JACK Life is Strange 2 EPISODE 3 IS OUT PLAY IT GUYS like this so jack can see
0:50- "...so I can inform you which one is going to be the best." Thank you. :) Not everyone has the time and money to do research like this. I want to eventually get into VR, but not right now.
1:14- "The headset is so much lighter than the other ones." That's good to know. I get headaches and dizzy-spells occasionally due to cracking my skull as a teen. I tend to stay away from heavy stuff that goes on your head.
- "I feel like a dancer!" (laughs) You look like one too. :D
- "What's my heart-rate at?" 172bpm! Um, I hope that your monitor isn't calibrated property and that is a false reading. A 29yr old person maxes out on average at 191bpm. Recommended target range: 105 to 162 beats per minute, and you are above that right now. Your heart-rate should go up- then level off and become steady for the activity that you are doing.
- "I'm a dancer." Cool. :) So am I. What is your best style? Mine is Tap Dancing, but I am sure I mentioned that before. ;)
- "That one mistake has messed me up. I keep concentrating on what I did wrong." You can't do that. Not here, not in real life. That is the kind of thinking that may kill you. (looks at deep scar on forearm) You have to forgive yourself, learn and move on.
- "I'm not even saying anything, there is no commentary on this video." Well, if what I can hear of your breathing is accurate- you need your wind for moving, not speaking.
End- "This is how much hair I have now. It's too much." Well, you can always trim it or cut it all off.
Life is strange 2 episode 3 is out! Play it!
robin's lil cuts during vr games where you just see sean .. flailing ...
yo guys anyone who knows the game should like this so it gets seen but he should play a game called Orbus VR !!!

Jack's mind: Thank God he's not stupid
Sean with the grey hair over here is reminding me of Link with his grey hair swoop. They both look good. It suits them.
I love that instead of just "hearts" he calls them "love hearts". It makes them seem just that much more special, yknow?

Hey, Sean. I've been looking through  your channel recently, and I have a a game for you I recommend. Warframe. Its free on steam, and its alot of fun, besides the fact it's really grindy and not pay-to-win. I suggest you try it, and please pay more than just like 3 hours of the game, to see it true beauty. Keep up the good work

"Irish people are basically pirates." -Jacksepticeye 2019
Wheres life is strange 2 episode 3
Jack needs to play overkill-Riot expert+ with heart rate monitor that song is insane!
What‚Äôs Considered a Dangerous Heart Rate?

    Fast beats (100 or above)
    Slow beats (60 or lower)

Heart rates can vary from person to person, but what‚Äôs considered normal? And when is a heart rate considered dangerous? Read on to learn more.
Fast heart rate

When your heart rate is too fast, it‚Äôs called tachycardia. For adults, a fast heart rate is generally defined as a heart rate over 100 beats per minute.

However, what‚Äôs considered too fast may also depend on your age and overall health.

There are many different types of tachycardia. Their classification is based on their cause and the part of the heart they affect. Experiencing tachycardia may be temporary.

Some possible causes of tachycardia can include:

    an underlying health condition
    anxiety or stress
    fatigue
    heavy caffeine consumption
    heavy alcohol consumption
    electrolyte imbalance
    fever
    intense or strenuous exercise or physical activity
    side effects from medication
    cigarette smoking
    certain drug use (such as cocaine)
Your heart rate during your INTRO was 150... holy moly
Jack's Mind: "Are we running"
Jack: "No?"
Jack's Heart: "Are we getting followed?"
Jack: "No?"
Jack's lungs: "Then why is your pulse raging?"
Jack: 
This is why I don't where socks
Proof he's a crab
SAFETY STRAP
Stop doing the shoot
Don't punch the head set. It did nothing to you
Anti?

2:11 

Jack - ‚ÄúBut this isn‚Äôt intense anyways‚Äù

Heart rate monitor- hmmmm
Monstercat song in a jacksepticeye video?!

Edit: Jack if you liked the last song, "Rattlesnake", you would like Overkill. It's also in the MCat pack
Whenever he talks his heart rate goes up. He yells so loud and I love it
Called jack plays pirate song is our capn...


OMG HE IS CAPTIN JACK SEPTICEYE
new CAPTAIN JACKSEPTICEYE SPARROW
Jack's heartbeat while playing :175
Jack's heartbeat while in the menu:187
Play Overkill by RIOT on Expert, Jack. You'll get your heartrate up ;)
Ive gotta say, I'm a dedicated monstercat/cloudkid fan so I know basically all of these songs.
woo! I've been waiting for you to upload more beat saber! This game looks so freakin awesome! I need to get a VR set!!


did not expect crab rave haha! That was enjoyable!
"Irish people are basically pirates" - Jackaboy, 2019
When Jack starts playing megalovania
Play more scary games with a heart monitor please
Sounds like ur gonna go into war
Ummmm maybe when they let you bring bluetooth speakers to war
omg I know ALL OF THESE SONGS, and they are AMAZING
Jack: This sounds like you're going into war! 
bounces like a baby
Jack : Its not that hard 
Me : Looks at heart monitor 181  
Also me : This man is a electrical wave of energy
getting Index and Rift-S, but not Quest?  hm....  get the QUEST mate!!!  I feel like it is the best entry device in VR for non-gamers and could really change the space.   We need the c'tapin Jack review, c'mon!
Anyone worried that jack was at 152 bpm just doing his intro
Me: Was looking away for a moment.
Me: Hears Til It's Over start.
Me: Being a long time fan of Tristam eeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~! YES
i look forward to the Official Jacksepticeye VR Review‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
*tills it's over plays
Me: YES YES YESSSSS. This the same song in just shapes and beats.
Patiently waits for Reality Check Through the Skull
sitting texting on phone


instantly recognizes Till Its Over


"how many of yous recognize these songs btw?"


i recognised them all. love monstercat <3
Why is your heart rate so high at the beginning of the video
Wait.... 2 VR headsets. 

I‚Äôm so poor.
never. Never. EVER







Wear headphones while watching Jack‚Äôs videos
Sean just talking to the camera counts as cardio
also i kept trying to adjust my monitor for a better angle on the boxes
did anyone else juss watch him in the box more then the video itself bc dat shit had me dying üòÇ
People be out there playing beat saber on hard and expert mode while i'm struggling on a moderately hard mobile rhythm game
Wait.. heart rate over 150 before even doing anything? Either Jack tried the game before recording or he should get that checked out.
Teacher:what instrument do you play?




Me: Its hard to explain
me: wow another vr video
also me: my head hurt AGAIN!
Jack pls try 100 Bills in expert
8:13 
When playing wii sports or wii resort
Someone do an animation of it as he's like a workout instructor. It'd be hilarious. Lol
The real question is, all these songs and he hasn't played Megalovania yet?! 

Not really a question but y'get the point
Jack's heart rate: 189
Me: u ok bruh?
Was Jack's new Sonic video just deleted?
Can you please play life is strange 2 ep 3??
I only just got the notification and there‚Äôs already 200 comments.
...
How???
Every time Sean plays beat saber he turns into a 40yr old yoga instructor
Your resting heart rate is 150??? xD omg
Heart monitor starts 149

Jack, I'm super worried.
Jack: Plays easy beat saber song
Also Jack: Heavy breathing
When Jacks heart rate goes up to 188 üò± BREATHE DAMMIT!
Sean‚Äôs heart rate before playing the game: 147
Me: HOLY S**T did someone yell CLEAR and use the aed paddles on him
WHERE DO YOU GET THIS I NEED IT!
Bro I got this game 2 days ago and I can do expert songs
Hey Jack can you play a fun VR game called Rec Room again and go in to more games?
Proof that Sean is part hummingbird, his resting heart rate is me on my 10th mile on the bike
I know crab rave, and thats about it
Hey Jack, do Reality Check Through The Skull with the heart rate monitor
Jack: irish people are basically pirates 
 
Me: ohh I thought they were gladiators üò´
Hey Coke Zero sugar, go sponsor Jack and his bais
Jack's hart rate is just almost constantly at 180... I'm pretty sure he isn't a human, he is a SQUIRREL!
I've tried VR once at a game expo, I was trying the job simulator specifically the cooking thing. VR is like a drug I cannot afford yet.
great gameplay jack buy CAN YOU STOP LOOKING DOWN
Jack: how many of you recognize these songs (Monstercat)
Me: Dude I grew up listening to these songs lol
You should play the overkill level on expert. That one is insane
Why don't people play calm games with heart rate monitors to verify that they're truly relaxing?
Sean: Irish people are basically pirates.
I literally had the same thought when I saw a video of how to speak with an Irish accent lol
Jack at 8:35 saying oh this is easy, obviously he hasn‚Äôt played rum and bass on expert mode let alone expert+. 
Being an expert+ beat saber player myself I know how ‚Äúdifficult ‚Äù the game can really getüòâ
The fact that Jack's heart rate was already ~140 since the start worries me. (Normal is b/w 80 - 110 or something)
Do MortalKombat it is in the game
How to make a game relevant




Slap a heart rate monitor in the video
you should try Just Shapes & Beats
4:46
Feel like I should add: Crab Rave was made by Noisestorm as a solo project. He's now on another solo project to make a game surrounding the song called Crab Champions! Hoping Jack will play it when it gets released ‚ù§
Me who just moved next to Sean: Hears yelling
Also me: What is that screaming?
The person I bought the house from:  Oh don't worry, that's sean. You wil get used to him quickly.
Sean: WORK THOSE THIGHS LADIES
maybe try VR Subnautica again? might have been improved
Dang. Sean's heart rate was 150 right at the beginning. I'm guessing Jack warmed up before the video, like jumping jacks?




I possibly think that's the reason why Jack is loud. I like it
maybe try VR Subnautica again? might have been improved
maybe try VR Subnautica again? might have been improved
maybe try VR Subnautica again? might have been improved
Jack thats nowhere close to my level i can Almost expert+
147 Heart rate from just STANDING!?! Wow Jack is a deadman walking.
Believe it or not, the game runs best on PSVR
There a crab rave in this video
Me: YES.
I don‚Äôt get how people think Megalovania sounds like that.
Jack: I‚Äôm so out of practice!

Me:...no sweetie I think you‚Äôre so out of breath
Jack is more scared playing Beat Saber than the horror game
My Heart rate would be 300 with this.
19:35 And here we see, kawaii Sean. A rare sight in Britain and the rest of the world! üòÇ
1:02 yeah thats why im annoyed that they changed the design of the controllers
I wonder when jack is gonna realize that megalovania is in the game.
Glad to see jack doing something related to drums..üôÉ
Every time I see the heart rate monitor in Jack's videos I think of this scenario now:
[The heart rate is hella high and Jack is taking a break, wheezing, sitting on the floor]
[someone comes in and asked] "Are you okay?"
[Jack just goes crazing screaming] "OH GOD NO NOT AYUWOKI!!!"
8:37 boi that hairline non-existant
#40 on trending for gaming
Sean: Irish people are basically pirates
Me: RIP gailic gladiator
Came in seeing that you have a very different look, was hoping you'd have changed to a more mature on screen personality. "TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA" and shouting through the video. Guess not.
I found the song it‚Äôs called be there for you if any wanted it ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è
Ahhhh I Love Rum And Bass!!!
PS4 has the PSVR and honestly its got really good quality especially for Beat Saber.
Jacks heart rate while playing a horror game: this is the highest heart beat you are going to have playing a game 

beat saber: HELLO THERE
Jack: does hype


Jacks Computer: Redirecting you to fortnite
(pause video) 0:00

Trying to gather force
little bit dizzy :"
What you see: cool stuff 

What other people see: wtf
Jack you should use a second pc with a capture card dedicated to recording. VR games are really brutal on the hardware and that's why you're seeing lag / dropped frames.
dancer: where did you learn to dance
new person: i played beat saber
8:23 
Jack: doing fortnite dance
Me: jack your hairline doesn‚Äôt look so great 
Me: realizing jack doing fortnite dance 
Me: does same dance
You play the song rap god by eminem
Gotta love the meme crab rave!
"Oh man I want to take over an island!!" 
~Se√°n McLAUGHlin 2019
Try the pymax 8k (I think that's how you spell it)
Hey Jack, can you play Kick the Buddy Forever? I heard from one of your videos that you like ragdoll physics, so you'll love it!
"176? jesus" continues to climb till 181
jack: "this is easy cuz its just like a normal level"
heart: i beg to differ
Please if possible use the integrated camera smoothing. Or use the camera plus mod.
It makes watching a lot easier. thanks!! :D
around 180  around where my heart rate goes when i run :0
I would like to see Jack play your contract has expired on beat saber .
Plz do pirates of the Caribbean in next vid of this
As an avid Monstercat listener, this was so amazing to watch
Jack: the safety strap if falling off my right controller!
A few moments later
Jack: let me fix the frickin strap! fixes left strap
Me: ummmmmmmmmm
Jacks resting heart rate is sanic speed JEEZUS
The max I saw your heart rate go up is 187
Jack: this isn't even intense
Hear rate: hold my beerüçª
Makes hilarious weird singing noise

I DONT IF YOU GUYS KNOW BUT I WORK OUT. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"IRISH PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY PIRATES!!" 
~Jack 2019
Working out with Jacksepticeye
When you play this game again can you do the rockerfeller street level? I totally don‚Äôt wanna see you do the dance
GAELIC GLADIATOR!!! Why in the ARSE have you not played Country Rounds on this game! It screams your f*ckin name!!!
I thought Jack's heart was gonna explode when the beat dropped in Crab Rave, man, from 164 to 182 in 10 seconds...
15:20 " YOU'VE GOT THIS SISTER" 
That's the motivation and PMA that we all needed today!
Our day of fun: watching jack normal things. 
Jacks day of fun: playing beat saber and wanting to take over an island. Just the usual
jack enable camera plus (right click the game and do third person) 
you can even have custom avatars or make it so its just the sabers 
i stream this game a lot on my twitch 
also id love to see you play vrchat again (maybe even live stream it so people can join ya)
Till it's over is in a game called "Just Shapes and Beats". That would be a AWESOME game to play if you don't mind possibly getting copy righted.
normal people: looks straight
Jack: *LOOK DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE NO ONE CAN SEE ANYTHING BUT THE FLOOR
Crab Rave
Ah, the music of my people, a fine choise.
Dude download beat drop and move the pov back and make it smoother pleaseeeee
also Jack, to get some speed in the swing Flick your controlers. hold them more at half and down so they can spin a bit. ( also is a bit less tiring )   and to stop squading you can adjust it to your height.
You need to go with the PiMax 5k or 8k vr. The FOV on that is insane.
Also, if you hole the rift controlers just by the bottom, as if they were drum sticks, that might help. Thats how i play at least.
I've never noticed before, but his lights match his sabers!
Right light/Right saber - Blue
Left light/Left saber - Red
you need to install camera + also you can start the steam version of the game even with the rift
Jack ya know there‚Äôs a lot of game songs including Megalovainia that you can play and I‚Äôm pretty sure in Megalovainia you get bones as sabers
Wanted to see you do Overkill on expert so much üò≠
Dude MonsterCat is probably one of my favorite labels. I recognize everything in this volume/playlist thing. (Also, May 9th was my Birthday)
I just love the wholesome reaction to seeing crab rave officially in the game
Can we have exercising sessions with Jack please that was hilarious
8:26 when you see roblox porn but like minecraft better
I wanna see someone make a video of jack with just the face cam playing beat saber
jack is a motivational speaker at fx a water workout with some of those things he
I signed in just to sub lol
I reacted the same way when I saw Crab Rave in the game.
Crab Rave has really awkward movements
jack playing beat saber and everything is chaotic and epic
 cuts to jack moving around like an autist
Jack : TOP OF THE MORNI-
Heart Rate: 1000
"One headset to rule them all"
Good God Jack your heart is running a marathon constantly
Absolutely love this video. Your moves are great jack. Keep up the good work.
Good Video

I‚Äôm sorry for not watching you for a while

I was with you since 500.000 subsüòä
6:20 "Cause that's making me be a crab" Jacksepticeye, crab of the year, 2019.
4:43 crab rave on hard isn‚Äôt easy. But i played it hard and faster.....  I was sweating XD
Its not over til it's over! üòç great job! Always a huge fan! I need to get a vr set so bad so I can play this!
Jack:Aw man I wanna take over an island
.
.
.
Me:Haven't u played "Islanders"?
when you can barely see the gameplay but his commentary made up for all of it Oh how beautiful XD
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Jack: I wanna go take over an island!
I love when u say ur intro jack.
Hey Jack! When you do Beat Saber again you should do the MEGALOVANIA from Undertale. You may pass out before the end of the song but it would be during one of your fav songs from Undertale!
4:40......my sister did this song in expert mode
I would like to know what the new rift is like. I am thinking about getting one but I wanna know if the new one is worth it or not :)
LOVEd this vid, love monstercat. I was screaming at the screen for you to play "Emoji" tho ^^;
I usually forget that you're actually rich 
Proves how humble and down to earth you are
Till it's over from just shapes and beats you should play it
Till it's over is the best Monstercat song!! Jack should play Just Shapes and Beats - that song is a level in that game too!
Jack: Irish people are kinda like pirates

Me: yes jack your probably part pirate
Thank you for putting crab rave in the video
Jack: ‚ÄúIrish people are basically pirates!‚Äù
Also Jack: Irish people are pirates, and gladiators, AND Vikings üëçüèª all of our ancestors are Irish
RUM N' BASS?! OH YES! Boom Kitty would be proud.
Someone walks in his room: "Ok...???"
Jack : it makes me to be a crab!
Me : imagines Jack as a crab raving
You should play Vertigo!!! Its like half life and portal but VR
I'm impressed by your mad Crab Rave skills Sean! I would have failed it within seconds. 4:36
I recognised all of the songs because I‚Äôve played them all üòÅ
I'd like to see you do expert + mode on a couple of songs. Trust me, it gets sweaty.
Jack ima making a video game I got the story just need to program a and I want you to be the first to play it
*Reads Title*    But why!!??
Best way of getting into techo music - Play Just shapes and beats and/or just listen to Monster cat: uncanged
go watch "Be CAREFUL playing this intense Beat Saber level" by Bandoot. it's intense.
I wear 145 lb of weight while playing works great good workout
AH! I'M SLIPPIN ON MAH SOCKS-
Jack, try megalovania on beat saber
20:10
"Awww, my face is all sticky and sweaty now!"
Should do Ghostbusters if they have it on beat saber.
I would pay all the money for this just to try it on Molly ü§£
jack: irish people are basically pirates
everyone: cant argue with that logic
BOOM KITTY <3
157 BPM at rest! Jack needs to get his cardio in!
15:50 i'm getting Legally Blonde feels here in this yellingüòÇ
Do more of this!(the heart rate thing)
Jack your resting heart rate is 150 is really high. it should be around 60-100. Unless you've played some before the video started then you're fine.
5:30 

His inner drummer is kicking in lmaoüòÇ
Can you turn up the FOV if you play this again, Please?
Damn you! You didn't play Overkill!
When ur a huge edm fan so you recognize every single monstercat song!!
now.. play beat saber with the muscle stimulator :D
Less arm movement and more wrist will help you a lot.
Play his intro at 0.25x. ..... Lol
Heart Breaker Man Alive!!!
To be honest this made my heart rate go up and I'm only watchingüò≥
holy cow your heart rate was 150 to start off on.  Are you okay???
Jack = beat saber god!!!
Jack I think irish people are vikings not pirates
So if you want a wireless rift, there IS the quest coming out next month ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúWhat, you egg!‚Äù
[stabs him]

Favourite Shakespeare quote
Play "Overkill" by Monstercat on Extreme :))
It looks harder than it is - You just need to find the rythm ;)
Tip: You might want to put on "no fail"
YEAH IM CRABBY, THATS CAUSE I PLAY BEAT SABER
Try reality check through the skull.
It‚Äôs extremely hardü§£
15:20 jack just became my workout instructor
The neighbor's kids:
Mommy who's yelling?
Neighbor:
Nobody honey. On a side note, would you prefer moving to America or China?
I love the floofy hair!!!!!!!
8:00 Homer Simpson, is that you ? üòÇ
15:20 
Can‚Äôt get a coke sponsorship so he tries to get beat saber to sponsor him
Who else wants to see him try 'Reality Check Through the Skull'?
Me:
Working overtime and saving up all of my money to even be able to buy the Valve Index when it launches
Jack:
"Yeah, I already pre-ordered all the new VR headsets."
Happy Wheels Season 2! Comment if you argree!
7:00 pirates ? I tshougt you were a viking
But you didnt order the quest??? That is pretty sad...
I was listening to Rum n' Bass before i watched this vid, such a good track
is anyone else concerned about jacks heart rate staying steadily over 150???
182 bpm? dude are you alright?
WTH WAS THAT ‚ÄúOoooo‚Äù
Jack plz play Days Gone it's really good
heart bpm starts at 155 Jack u okay
187! Dude you okay??
Jack I love you so much man in this video you look like you're having a blast. I'm not even halfway throw the video and I can't stop smiling thank you for making me smile and brightening up my day. :)
"Mom I'm going to go take over a island I will be back"
Geez i got most of these song on my gaming music list lol :D
Just a tip for next time you record, get the "smooth camera" mod it'll make your video quality that much better!
I'M NOW DEAF SO THANKS. I'm part Scottish üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø part Irishüá®üáÆ part Welshüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø and part Englishüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø. And I'm think of moving to Scotland what do you all think?
Just saying it‚Äôs not that different for jacks heart to race üòÇ 


Jacks heart: f-ck being calm wooooh
JACK WE NEED MORE DRUM VIDEOS
Level 3 off the campaign sounds like your outro 2years ago with septicsam in a tube
Who else was shouting at Jack "RAISE YOUR HEAD GODDAMNIT!"
Idle heart rate 150 hope that‚Äôs incorrect lol
23:00 such a good workout he shook the ground
Can you play the song "frontier justice" ?
When Jack played till it's over, I nearly died
Talk about a workout. Damn, I need to switch up my routine. üòÇ
the normal heart rate when not doing anything ( and not sleeping ) is from 60 to 100
7:52 "Irish people are basically pirates!"
So the crab song was made on my birthday and Easter ( in 2018 my birthday was on Easter)
Bloody hell the auto-focus at the end was giving me a brain aneurysm
it bothers me much he looks down
Jack please make a video on the new lis episode! :3
So once you reach the 170's for heart rate bpm you are experiencing a max effort work out that is pushing limits. Good job jack
Jack you should play overkill by riot the song is badass and the level is insane
Next video idea
Killing myself with a heart monitor
Nobody:
Sean: I WANNA GO TAKE OVER AN ISLAND
Thank you Robin very cool
As a dubstep enthusiast, I approve this gameplay. :)
you know what is also irish a 4 leaf clover which I found yesterday
Forget asking if the background‚Äôs real
Is Jack even real?
Just amagen a monster sneeks behind
Excellent! Looking forward to your play of Vader Immortal!

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but he‚Äôs looking down a lot. I still love u tho jack
i'm getting a valve index as well i can't wait
You should try to play Moonlight Sonata Mvt. 3 on Beat Saber.
This game makes me sweat so much it looks like I just got out of the shower.
I use the Rift which I got for like $300.
jack talking so much he forgot how to breathe XD
Jack, please try "OVERKILL" if possible.
Also, please keep making more of this game, love it.
thank you for comparing headsets at the end! I think I might look into an oculus because of how much cheaper it is than the latest vive
YESSSS MONSTERCAT!!!
"i work out"
yeah... your resting heart rate is over a 100, which speaks for itself, or the monitors accuracy
Has he done system of a down yet cause that would be sickkkkkküî•üî•
13:40 This song is from my favorite game Just Shapes & Beats it's part of the final boss fight.

I know many of these songs particularly Particularly monstercat because EDM is my jamü§òüèøü§òüèø.
Roses are red 
Violets are blue
Jack I love you








No homo
Can you make a video or livestream life is strange 2 episode 3
Hey did clone drone ever get another update?
Mom why is he shouting
Why do i feel like Anti is creepin' up again?

You should so do another drum cover or solo :)

‚ÄúI want to take over an island..!‚Äù 
WELCOME TO MCLOUGHLAND

omg your hair im dyng
"You got this sisters!" 
- Jacksepticeye 2019
Hey jack, I don't know if anyone else has seggested this yet, but one of the hardest songs on beatsaber is reality check through the skull. It's an undertale remix, and I don't know how to get it myself, but if you think your up to it, you could try it.
Its awkward without sound XD
Hey, why the sonic video isn't in the channel anymore?
You should play Megalovania on Beat Saber in Custom Songs
Is anyone else worried about Jack's heart rate?
When his hair starts splitting in the middle and falls towards his face it looks really good
play life is strange!! :]
"this is easy" breathes heavily
Jack: "I work out"

Heart: hey buddy be careful your near maximal heart rate
3:00
O O F
Im feeling kinda sick the vid is wiggle-ish but i enjoy it tho
Jack: it's easier than it seems
Me watching this at 2x speed: I sure hope it does
Could you play Hopes and Dreams from undertale in this please!
next


Jack: i play life with a heart monitor?!
LMAO jack why is your heart rate higher than when I have a panic attacks üòÇ
8:52 It's johnny bravo
I absolutely love that you switch between personal cam feed and both. Like he said, it is easier than it seems, but Sean definitely makes it looks easy.
Life is strange 2?
My birthday is tomorrow!! Can I get some happy birthday wishes?

üëá
Jack why is your resting 150?? Take a nap dude, do some meditation.
Red solo cup
Clp clp clp clp
Ill fill you up
Clp clp clp clp
Youre going to die young : )
I don't like how you kept looking down on the game it made it hard to see it
I like the music pack. It's pretty difficult on Expert+, but I can do it.
You could say you were playing Heart- Beat Saber! XD!
ur like in a party üòÇüòÇüòÇ
please, Sean, play more hitman. it has always made me laugh.
i recognize a lot of these songs
Recognize the songs? Tristam is my god damned anthem!
One question.
WHERES THE FLAMINGO SHORTS!
Play rigs on PS4 vr it‚Äôs a badass game were you fight online or offline in robots that you can customise
Resting heart rate of 155 at start of the video?
Jack: I love how perfectly the rift controllers fit my hands 1:08

Also jack:I hate the stupid wire hanging from this headset 2:39

Also Jack:I‚Äôm buying the Rift S and the valve index  

OCULUS QUEST!?
Love all songs by the monstercat consortium
I see that glitch, you Irish buttcheak üòè 12:30
that song til it's over koms from  just shapes and beats jack should play it its fun ; )
Jack the video of today got taken down we can't watch it

To have Hart attack you need a Hart rate of 180 üò∞üò∞üòµ
14:00 'Til It's Over by Tristam
The final boss theme of Just Shapes And Beats
yay  a loud and fast intro :D
Anyone else notice that his heart when my up in this more than in the scary game ü§£ü§£ü§£
Se√°n your high is 188
Your heart gets quicker talking
This guy is great at this game.
Congratulations on #40 on trending

I don't know if you guys know but I work out!
*has a resting heart rate of around 149bpm
beat saber 
seat



üëå
Preeetty preeetty weird effect at 12:30 and 16:07






 Anti is coming
I like to watch you play beat saber
If this is intense, u should play osu!
Just binged watch the simulacra series before this hehehe

Edited:Fuuuuuuckk ittttt soooo muuuuch
I heard the first song and I could see myself playing expert+ with it üòÇüòÇ
The Gaelic Gladiator has the the skill of dancing as well as many others that mortals should never set their gaze upon
He needs to download camera+ for a wider recording FOV
he ordered two and already has two at minimum.. im too poor for one vr headset DX
You start with 150 bpm... normal heartrate is 60-100 bpm
Did jack just growl at 18:13 before he said ‚Äòsh*t‚Äô üòÇ I swear he growled
has he played his i believe in Steven song on this yet?
Jack play just shapes and beats its a great dodging game with boss fights plz
I want to give a tip look forward not down üëç
Jack you always have your heartbeats too high. Are you sure you don't need to go to the doctor? XD
The heart rate you reach is like the heart rate I have when I am sprinting lmao
Vaporthegamer did some videos with monster cat. I don‚Äôt exactly remember so you should check him out. He‚Äôs pretty chill >^<
Imagine doing chop suey or toxicity or metallica
Rum 'n' Bass = Pirates of the Caribbean remix.
Edit: Because I'm a geek, I recognize every song. Also, Till It's Over is from Just Shapes and Beats.
Hey Sean been awhile how have you been man
Who watch the whole video??
You should try the song rap God
*watches till 13:18 *
TILL ITS OVER
GOD JUST SHAPES AND BEATS MUSIC
No one:
Literally no one:
Not a god dam soul:
Jack: IRISH PEOPLE ARE PIRATES!!!
I'm  dead üòÇüòÇüò±
Hey jack If you look up   beat saber mod manager it has a mod for the fov that helps with streaming/recording~
With the headset on you look like obi-wan with the hair
What is the viewing angle during this whole video? lol
I like ya better with green hair that‚Äôs the best color ever
now download reality check through the skull and play it

tip: play on no fail, you'll get why
am  the only one who's literally jealous of his hair.. my hair looks like poop compared to his 

your heart rate is really high, is that like normal?
Maybe, would've been an idea to use the in-built smooth camera option in settings next time!
The next time you do this, try the uganda meme
jack needs mods to make it better for the viewer even on the vive
Jack you should get the plugin that stabilizes your camera
PLEASE continue stardew valley like if u agree to make him see this
I'd like to see jack playing this with hardbass! xd
Dares dis guy who stood in one place, completely calm and was in hard mode in that game
Jack is a Crab Viking Pirate!
Just ignoring that he had 156 bpm even before he started the vid
I thought you were going to have a heart attack üòÇ
I love you bro (husband) love from your sister Sarah
jack cane you play Ori and the Will of the Wisps
You need to play unlimited power and Overkill, those are the best songs lol
Lol who else has a fast heart rate (or at least it feels like it) when you‚Äôre doing well in a game




For me it‚Äôs mainly when I upload, makes me nervous broüòÇüòÇ
Jack all the monstercat songs you played i have listened to on my own but the video was awesome
I dance a lot to rum and bass and still get it perfectüòÑ
5:17 orange justice lol
How you find the standard ‚Äúmax‚Äù heart rate for most is you take their age and subtract it from two 220... jack is 29... that gives him a safe max of 191 bpm... he got up to 188... wtf
Damn a 188 high score

Next time you should go for 200
is the PSVR any good
Hey Jack are you also considering getting the oculus quest?
blame the lag and the.... inner MEME
for those of you who dont know i was dancing like the crab from the meme arms up and down like the crab
It literally gives me anxiety the fact that the camera is pointing so far down ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üò¨
13:20 I know this its called Till it's over by tristam
Me: Are you trying to make heartrate higher?
Jack: 3:44
Jacksepticeye's Rift Review, coming out July 2019
Jack i saw the crab rave vid
You should do megalovania
I would miss the first one, and keep on missin' till the end :)
Now I want an exercise video from Sean üòÇüòÇ
To fix the problem move the hight of the floor up more you get it because the VR headset you are using records the game perfectly so you have to fix the floor
JACK ADJUST UR FOV
It's all on spotify Jack
JackyBoy you need to install the mods like the camera+ it makes it better for you and you can even get custom avatars
8:23 hype?
jack please play just shapes and beats with 4 of your friends because it has multiplayer and you can play the story with your friends too.


Edit:OMG!!!!!THAT SONG AT  I RECOGNIZE THAT SONG FROM JUST SHAPES AND BEATS!!!!!!!!!!
i think the dots on your shirt are messing with the auto focus of your face cam!
like so he sees this maybe <3
10:40 This reminds me of W2Sü§£
I know this has nothing to do with this video, but you should go to Doki Doki Literature Club, delete Monika then start a new game.





See what happens :)
that shirt tho Jack, it looks good
The funnest cardiovascular exercise you can reliably have in your game room.

Just 30 minutes 3-4 days a week and you'll be heart healthy.
yo jack you should play siren head
Hey there is a new episode for life is strange two that came today so could you play it
Jack u got a green screen why not just green screen your self into the game?
Lol heart rate starts at 150
when is the new vacation simulator video coming, BTW  there's also coming an oculus quest: a completely wireless headset with bleutooth in the headset!!!
Also, try Final Boss by Nitro Fun.
Lol this man has two vr headsets I‚Äôd be lucky to get one
Me: Looks up average heart rate for adults 
Google: 60 to 100 bpm
Me: Looks at video before Jack starts
Video: 145 bpm
Me: wut?
Reeeee what happened to da new vid jack?
Ur heart rate should be between 120 and 180 during any type of physical activity

Btw love ur vids! They‚Äôre so funny
Gasp "till its over" love that music
13:17 is the end game boss fight song in "just shapes and beats"
Average adult bpm is 60-100, when he started he was at 150
i kept lifting up my head trying to see more
I went to my friend house and we played this game. I asked her if she had "All the Way."  Now it's her new favorite song.
Just pre-ordered the quest, so hopefully I'll be able to play more beatsaber
Jack: I am a crab after all
Me releasing my inner brian dechart: Yeah, I'm crabby
your a good workout trainer
oh my goodness look up please xD
why is jacks resting heart rate like 150? is anyone else concerned for our boy's health?
Jack!! For the love of god go see a doctor. Youre a young healthy guy, for not being like flat out running, 150-180 is not good! Im a cardiac patient and Im on medication to keep my heart rate in check. It was 157 yesterday and I nearly collapsed. When you are just standing and havent even started the game yet and your heart is already at 150, that's dangerous.
Not yet snake IM NOT DEAD
If you're playing the monstercat pack you got to play overkill
5:37 just relax, Jack, let the music tell you where to swing your sword
I think streamers would know MonsterCat songs way better then most YouTubers honestly..
You should be a workout enthusiast
To be specific, the song at 4:31 is called Crab Rave by Noisestorm. Good stuff.
jack if you play just shapes and beat you will definitely have a lot of fun
OMG! TILL IT'S OVER IS AMAZING! JACK YOU SHOULD PLAY "JUST SHAPES AND BEATS"! that song is the final boss theme!
I dare you to do expert
Wish you'd looked up a bit more so we could see what was coming, but i understand. ::tips hat:: be well, sir.
LIFE IS STRANGE 2 EPISODE 3 PLEASE
You should play more sea of thieves!!
I love Monstercat. Also, Till It's Over is an amazing song. I love Tristam's  music.
Lit keep up the good work plz
Play more of the custom songs
Holy shit look at that heart rate
Why did Jack take the "Sonic stole my idea" Video down?
Me: trying to listen to the song
Sean: ITS TIME TO LOOSE WEIGHT EVERYBODY
Me: Stfu Jack..
Also Me: OKAY LEST GO Follows moments drunkenly
Why did you start with a 140 heart rate? My shit is 80
I wish I had VR just so I could play this game!!
Am i the only one that was tipping my phone because he needs to lift his head more lol
Not gonna go into detail but, am nerd rift s bad :)
Dang jack you got BOTH headsets?  Thats like $1500!
Jack the vive was constantly looking down
in this video jack beats his saber
I'm still trying to beat Crab Rave on Expert... But it be  h a r d  qwq
heart rate is through the roof
Jack please play Life Is Strange 2 episode 3...your storyline is the best!
I'm both Scottish and Irish what am I??
Tomorrow I will finally experience playing VR
Will you play silksong?
Jack, you should try adding some mods. Using camera plus might be a better way to record than the raw footage of what you see.
PLEEEAAAASEEE play Reality Check Through the Skull XP
Of course the Index is gonna be the best.  But that's the great thing about PCs.  Options.  Rift S will be an excellent entry level VR platform.
I challenge you to play Rush B on Beat Saber
Jacksepticeye yes i LOOOOVVVVEEEEE You're Videos 




Buy Coke Zero sugar with an added hint of Vanilla
Same geat Coke taste but with Zero sugar 




And Vanilla
when i saw monstercat, i knew it was gonna be good
and that's actually the most ammount of songs in a JSE beat saber video that i recognize. i haven't listened to boundless and the song after that (forgot the title) in so long jesus
You should do it again
He does know anything above 100 is considered too fast right?
I was skipping and I just hear Jack's breathing
Next : playing death grandma simulator with heart rate monitor
Try to do ''Castlevania: Bloody Tears''
I can't believe this is his job
Am kinda sad that he didn't try riot - overkill.
This game seems great for hand-eye coordination
"Haff ta have da mug of tae before ya start de day."
-Jacksepticeye 2014
Your heartrate be higher then mine during actual gym exercises. 

It's  a struggle to even get it to 200bpm. You  making it look like this could be easily done given intense enough body workouts.
plz try to do the song meglodovenia (sorry if I can't spell) from under tail
EMOJI VIP is one of my favourite songs of Monstercat/Pegboard Nerds you should try and find Try This
where can you buy beat saber?
Jack's hair is so long now it falls into a middle part üòÇ
#36 would be #1 if Fortnite didn't exist.
If this ever gets seen by Sean I‚Äôll freak:

I got a coffee in name of Sean 
It‚Äôs title was Luck O‚Äô the Irish 
It was nice
Play life is strange 2 episode 3
the normal heart rate is 100 at max but yours was 150 at the lowest in this vid haha
i remember listening to so much monstercat stuff in year 7, this throws me back :,)
You should make a version of all the way but instead of clips of videos you actually sing
Jack should try Darth maul mode
Try the Oculus Quest
Try the Oculus Quest
Here's a suggestion... How bout you react to some "questionable" content with a heart rate monitor?

You know what I'm talking about ;)
Try the Oculus Quest
hey you gotta check out haptic VR suit it makes you feel in vr!!!
hey you gotta check out haptic VR suit it makes you feel in vr!!!
So Jack is going to play Alestorm During TABS?
Monstercat is like 90% of the music I listen to these days. BASSHEAD FOR LIFE. no.......... not the fish... the soundz.
Y u record beat saber and not steamvr mirror view... Wait that's right you on Oculus. Reeeeeeee
Kinda sad robin cut out a part exactly when the beta was about to drop :(
Jack are you looking down.  Sometimes we see the ground..we see the ground in the recording :0
Where's vacation simulator?
Me: tilting my head back to see as if I'm also in the VR 

Why no work XD
Do Rockefeller street would be lovely
I'm not an expert, but from the last time I did my research, I remember that keeping your heart rate this high for an extended period of time might cause permanent heart problems.
Please stay alive Jack.
<3
they should make this game with feet trackers xD
Jack is irl Chris Traeger
The Camera+ mod will fix your recording, and make it infinitely better with FOV and such
19:10 to 19:14 Good job Robin!
PLAY LIFE IS STRANGE 2 EPISODE 3!!!
Jack's too busy having fun playing the game too play the game, only on jacksepticeye
Jack do rap god
play  life is strange 2 ep 3 it just came out
i knew 90% of the songs lol
jack being a workout trainer with mood swings for 5 minutes straight
14:00 my favorite part and song
I recognise ALL OF THEM
Heart Rate Monitor?

Etika, is that you?
You should do soviet Tetris it's fantastic
You should do some more grand theft auto videos
JAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCKKKKKKK DO RIOT OVERKILL!!!
Jack plz play subnautica or satisfactory plz
If You thought only jack screamed u were wrong check that heart rate
–ë—Ä–∞—Ç.   –∞—Å.    —Å—ä—à—Ç–æ—á—É–≤–∞—Ö.    –ß—É–≤–∞—Ö—Ç–∞–∑–∏–º—É–∑–∏–∫–∞
I love this game so much that it's become the fun part of my workout session!
Jack episode 3 of life is strange is out pls play it soon
JACK I JUST HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA YOU SHOULD PLAY REC ROOM WITH US SINCE THERE IS CROSSPLAY FOR BOTH PC AND PS4 AND ON TOP OF THAT THE GAME IS FREE
Jack: are you serious we have to play this song
I do till it‚Äôs Ofer  is from just shapes and beats
yeah it also looks like its more zoomed in btw
Love your content Jack üî•
PS: I just bought this game a few days ago. Problem with my rift installing...so I JUST got to play it last night. Absolutely LOVE this game! I need the exercise...I shall become an Expert+ master within the next couple months. ... ... [famous last words... ;) ].


Oh, and I tried an Easy...too easy. Normal...to easy. Hard...this is where I started. Even did one song on expert (my 5th or 6th). I honestly think that if you are an actual drummer then this game is a LOT easier for you. Like you Jackiboi, I'm also a drummer. Beat Saber really does make "use" of the arm and hand/eye coordination muscle-memory. Absolutely LOVE this game! :)
I love the beat saber videos. I really miss the Hitman "Screwdriver" videos though! jacksepticeye when are you going to do another one of those?
The video on the rift is like weird for the viewers
3:43 is hilarious LOL
Feels good to be here first for once üòÇüòÇ‚ù§
It looks like you kept getting smacked by the notes
Can you make a video of you playing this but only with the external audio and the face cam?
Jack I'm scared for you health your resting heart rate was a 150
This would give me anxiety
Do you guys prefer just dance or beat saber?¬ø

Like-beat saber
Comment-just dance
This would give me anxiety
when you have ADD
I havent been here for years...
If you want a really good song to make you feel like you‚Äôre drumming then I‚Äôd recommend Overkill
when you play it next time, play KDA (in the extras tab)
Watch the entire red vs blue series and tell me what you think
You should play katana zero.
Yeah I stopped watching halfway through because of the looking down thing but If I were to get one game on VR it would be 100% best sabre
5:30 the heavy breathing is killing me üòÇüòÇüòÇ i  dont have a VR to play this game, but i want to get VR just to play crab rave ü¶Ä
More games with the Heart Rate Monitor. This was badass!
Please never stop yelling lol üíöüíöüíöüíöüíö
Do the PS VR for Beat Saber
play KDA next time lol hahaha
At 10:27 I had a heart attack. After watching No Mercy, this song gives me anxiety. üò≠
can you play rap god?? is this a request that's gonna be seen?
Why don‚Äôt you show me little bit of spine you‚Äôve been saving for his mattress 6:47
Hey, Jack.  Just some advice for recording these.  There's a Beat Saber mod called Camera Plus.  It makes the game much easier to look at from the outside.  It increases FOV, smooths out movement, etc.
JACK pls play chop seuy
Epic! Wish I could play any VR games in general ;-;
When I first got this game I used to play it for like 4 hours every day and when I got done I had to shower cuz I would be drenched in sweat LOL
irish people are everything
THIS IS THEE BEST GAME EVER
He looks like Dwight from The Office with the rift on
JACK'S HEART RATE IS SKYROCKETING!!!
:crab: :crab: :crab:
Hey Jacksepticeye can you do Eminem‚Äòs rap song
i know alot of songs
7:30 BOOM KITTY! <3
@jacksepticeye Thank you for really detailing the differences with all the different VR headsets! Definitely going to help me make an informed decision when I buy one.
I have a seizure and I'm motion sick AND I'm kinda high right now. This video is a one way trip to... idk where but it's gonna be SICK!
Good job Jack next is expert plus and while you're at it play a song called Quaver ;) i'm sure you'll have fun with that one (wankers cramp)
A winner is you! Jack!
shouldv'e used the camera plus mod
This is hard to watch.  üôÅ please keep your head straight. Literally can't see.
Pegboard Nerds, Noisestorm, Ephixa, Stonebank, Project 46, Tokyo Machine, Karma Fields, Muzzy, and so much more... badasses!!
Crab rave!!!!
as a twitch streamer who uses monster cat alot i know most of their music uwu
you still playing life is strange? ‚ù§Ô∏è
It would be so fun if you did this in public.
He should put an epilepsy warning at the start of the video XD
Just ignore my 1st comment and pertend this is my only com ok




Some of these song made me want to take over a iland
A lot of the songs of the monstercat songs are on my Spotify playlist, and those songs  that are on my  playlist are mostly from Tristam and Tokyo Machine.
No one in my family appreciates electronic music tho
where's life is strange 2 episode 3
what you talking about you the best jack and I hope you find that gold In the chest and dance you life away pls. :D
I loved the last episode when he played Jacksepticeye songs!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
I love the face cam out of context shots
You should totally check out the var game Audica! It looks soooo coool
look up jack!!!!!
Life is strange 2 episode 3 came out today
I feel like jack is better than most people at fast stuff in the game bc he's a drummer but idk
You can give me one of the vr
12:30 I'm not one for conspiracies, but.... Anti? Is that you?
Is the monstercat x rocket league pack in this, if it does then I hope Jack plays it, vol 1 is full of good songs
Jack turn up your Viewmodel/Fov

They should try and put some Avicii music there XD
The funny thing about this is that i go at like the speed of sound when i play beat saber and jack goes really slow
you need to play echo arena man
If you have an AMD (Ryzen) Processor, then yes the Vive Wireless Adapter has issues with that. Vive said that they're investigating it, but ehh.

How many memes can you make out of this one vidüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Com on you got this all the way keep on flying onther song
When your doing this you look like sans
12:30 Glitch? Also nice video, really love this game.
The Valve index is going to be insane your definitely going to that cause the new controllers and how good the headsets meant to be, you should get the valve leg trackers with the valve to get full immersion with the off ear headset and knuckle controllers
i think the background is real
When Sean only plays hard difficulty
Not only is the crab song fuckin' awesome, but it has green blocks in it too!
I think jack should play grand theft auto san Andreas
Dude, a resting heart rate of around 150 is not good, see a doctor please.
You should try (all the way) your song

Yay i love watching gameplay of you looking at the ground and flailing your arms.
Jack do a attack on Tatan video please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!üò¢üò¢
Jack: ‚Äòmy heart rate nearly reached 200‚Äô
Hulk:‚ÄôYeah! DAB.‚Äô

13:24 Tristam was one of my favorite artists for the longest time

I‚Äôm sitting her with a big piece of chocolate cake watching Jack workout üòÇüòÇ

Anti 16:08?

Now there are 5.3K Comments
13:21 "How many of you recognise these songs, by the way?"
Tristam- Till It's Over. The one you did before that was Boundless by Aero Chord. Both songs are really old in terms of Monstercat releases, both on the Uncaged YouTube channel, and both insanely popular.
He said he didnt sweat,, his face is sweaty =‚Ä¢=
IM GETTING MOTION SICKNESS FROM THE FOV
Who else clicked faster than sonicüòÇ?

Life is strange 2 ep 3 is out !!! Sean play it
Reminds me of guitar hero
I played beat saber but I was to short üòí
Im moderately concerned at how high your heart rate was. You started at 150 and you weren‚Äôt even breathing heavily üò¨
Everyone, be looking for Anti clues because I'm pretty dang sure he's back.. there was a little something at 12:30 but I've seen bigger sightings in videos from a couple days ago as well :0
EDIT: There's also one at 16:08!
You said punch that like button in the face i punched the dislike button on acedent
Did you ever had that thought when u see someone gets heart and said i wish i commented that well i did
Play more Beat Saber plz Sean
Is nobody going to talk about jacks beautiful singing at 3:45
Jack: I'm just bad at it proceeds to hit a mad combo
Me: throws out my headset Nah, I am worse
I never thought I'd see the day where Jack accidentally does a nay nay twice.
Been here since 2013 and you've still never let me down to entertain me <3
GET  READY *throws phone across room to dance * (beat drops)
JESUS CHRIST JACK HEART RATE TO 188 BREATHE GOD DAMMIT üòÇüòÇ
It's like the second screen suddenly has a FOV of like 60 =O
Can you play GTA 5
3:33 "this is easy cuz this is just like a normal level"
Jacks heart: "oh god please no please stop"
It looks like play on a drum
In the grab song, who did the danceüòÇüòÇüòÇ CAUSE I DID
I want to up the volume for the music, but Jack is way to loud on 100%. WHAT DO I DO üòÇ
I know almost all of monster cat songs and I've been subbed to them since 2012
not gonna lie, all those old monstercat songs brought me so much nostalgia, need to listen again to those gold albums
5:41 his heart rate though
Should of played epic by tokyo machine
This is my favorite part 15:42
I keep trying yo tilt my head up like it's gonna help XD
Love the video regardless of how you think the recording did. = ) You might want to check your floor distance though. It looks like you're bent over a good bit. Can't be comfortable. = (
Do more pls
Heart r8: exists

Jack: I'm about to end this mans whole career.
U gonna try out the oculus quest?
Minecraft is the best game in the world
@jacksepticeye did you ever tried the Mixed-Reality solution Lenovo Explorer (or Acer, etc.) and the Controllers? I would like to know your opinion about them.
Most of monstercat I've heard was Just Shapes and Beats for Switch.
Life is strange
its too hard to see, maybe a bit higher than it might be fine
Do Monster cat final boss
Its easier than osu
I have been on this channel from 2016 and Idk what the crab is
Jack Life Is Strange 2 Episode 3 Is Out!

Ig you want him to play it like this comment
5:32 R2-D2 intensifys
JACK friendly reminder

jack i though you said you a while ago irish are vikings, now pirate. PS:just saying...
I know most the songs you play on beat saber
You know it‚Äôs bad when his heart rate is 170
Jack Does Dance Lessons
I was here watching before the post-notifications even advised me to.
The second you started talking about "have you heard of these songs?" I Immediately recognized it. This was my friend's favourite ever song, so he played it on permaloop all the time.
augh..... my head.....
U so bad ü§£üëå
16:31 20 more heart beats then he would of turned into hulk
was wondering y tf he was talking so fast. left the speed on 1.25 facepalm
I bet you cant beat crab rave on expert
would you suggest vive or rift if i have a very low budget but i want a very good one. PLEASE HELP!
jack should try playing reality check through the skull it's hard
patiently waiting for your life is strange 2 episode 3 video‚úä
Stop looking down so much, I can barely see the game.
Gaelic gladiator = pirate
Then take over the fortnite map
I love you from..Emily
I wanna see him try out expert
The blue light is still broken :)
Jack you should install a mod for beatsaber called cameraplus it fixes the staring the ground issue and makes it look really cool just set the fov to 90
Play sophies curse and I know that you will wet your pants after playing it
Play MineCraft in VR do it for yalady
Play just dance with a heart rate monitor that's a real work out
Try playing with jack. Its fun.
Is there a way to add your own songs?¬ø I really wanna see you do megalovania or your best nightmare
Man, when Sean played "Till it's over" all I could think was how much I want to see him play "Just shapes and beats"
Jackdanceiceye
Everyone just wait till jack throws his controller across the room lel
B R E A T H
Are you going to get an Oculus Quest?
About time you Beat your Saber again.
Hey Jack when you said that your not good at this I said tell us in the COMMETS that we don't know
I want a 5 minute video of Sean playing beat sabre but we don‚Äôt actually see him playing the game just him in the room waving his arms around
Where is satisfactory
When ever he said rift I kept thinking about the fortnite rift
tabs has mods
when it reached 188 i thought he was going to die...
Of course he played Crab Rave. He holds everything like a crab.
Jack play doodle army 2 on mobile plz its awesome
Jack's heart beats harder on a rhythm game than a horror game lmao x)
And final boss by monster cat
If you don‚Äôt know, the harder and more accurate you cut the cubes, the more points you get.
Jeuses christ
I'm getting an oculus quest in a couple months and this is the first thing I'm going to buy lol
Can you play any bts songs? My heart would explode! (In a good way c'mon jacküòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è)
good hes what's his heart rate at ITS OVER 9000 thank you
Jack the Conqueror wants to take over an island
Jack:Hey Ma I‚Äôm a dancer
Jacksepticeye is so good at beat saber.

He enjoys playing this game a lot, it looks like fun.
Makes me so happy to see jack play most of these songs since some I haven‚Äôt heard for up to 5 years. He should defo try play feeling stronger
I feel like the tracking for the Rift was much better on this game than on the Vive. You hit much more notes this time around.
Play Life is strange music if you can find it
1:10 Sean has a vr headset on still looks downs at the controllers
You're the best Gaelic Crabby Gladiator i've ever seen!üòÇ
try the oculus quest
2:31 THATS WHAT SHE said
13:17 ITS TILL ITS OVER :D
jack septic eye needs to play days gone
180bpm Jack are you okay? Should I send help?
I've actually seen Boundless on osu! and it is very difficult one from the one i have.
I‚Äôd like to see you try a song on expert
Omg I just realized imagine Monster Cat making a collab with Jacksepticeye a All the Way remix or an original song for Jacksepticeye. Jack Please make this happen.
Jack i think you might have the heart of a mouse because holy shit thats insane heart rate like thats the point that id start being afraid of heart failure XD
Download the mod manager and get camera mod +. It helps stabilize the screen output
GUYS JACK HAS CRAAAAAAABBSS
1273 jack plz play rockenfeller street
If you wanna do more Monstercat songs, you should do Teminite's remix of Hero by Pegboard Nerds
188 is the highest heartrate 6:09
one good way of making your heart beat is that you download the level "red like roses part II" from rwby
Anyone else think Jack would like Audica? If you don't know it's like beat saber but with guns and looks awesome
seriously nobody noticed the 3 glitches in this video???
Your song all the way is in the game
your WAY to overdramatic with your cuts and we cants see whats happaning
With a heart rate of 150 in the start this can't go well...
PLS do monster cat error code!
I play beat saber and it cost less than a gym membership so I‚Äôm happy and in shape
Did it bother anyone else that he was looking down the whole time?
Today's fact: The most popular item at Walmart is bananas. They sell more bananas than any other single item they have in stock.
you need to increase your fov if you want it to look more realistic
Look at the way Sean‚Äôs hair looks it‚Äôs awesome
Yeah guys I‚Äôm sorry but none of you are cardiologists lmao 
Sean is okay, I‚Äôm sure. His elevated HR at the beginning was probably because of a test run or bc he was pumping himself up.
180 is perfectly normal during a workout, especially for someone of his fitness level.
He‚Äôs more than likely okay, chill out everyone üòä
fake background...
180+ WOW I haven't reached that throughout my lifetime. My resting heart rate is around 60-75 then after dance practices or some exercise and it only goes on about 120-150. Is that normal?ü§î
Jack looks so funny if its only his webcam on the screen
8:00 it sounds like a dahihandi or no probably more like Ganesh chaturthy song those Indian DJ songs
The second to last song was from a game called just shapes and beats
Play a song called Reality check through the skull. It‚Äôs an expert level song and I think you‚Äôd like it!
... What is Sean's resting hr?
I have tachycardia, this made me laugh üòÇ
I love this Jack.... Do more Monstercat songs please. I didn't know you knew who they were.
Who thinks he should play a song by K?D
i could barley see anything when he was playing becaus it looked like he was locking down the whole time
Jack, please don't break the red lamp this time.üòáüòáüòá
13:17 FEEL THE POWER OF JUST SHAPES AND BEATS! Feel the power of TOTAL ANNIHILATION

14:50 "I probably dont need to yell" .... WHO ARE YOU? and what have you done with Jack? :D
I dare you to try lycanthropy on hard mode.
Jack... please make an appointment with a cardiologist. You are freaking us all the f out.
Damn, I just subscribed to because of Satisfactory but he doesn‚Äôt make videos of that anymore.
Monstercat fecking rocks!
Jesus Christ Se√°n! I'm Diabetic and my heart rate is lower than yours! Normally 72 bpm. Go to a doctor please, us and Gabby don't want anything happening to you

To anyone in this community who can help is the playstation vr any good? I'm thinking about getting one seeing how I don't have a computer and want a introduction into vr and I agree with jack those controllers are really comfortable I tried one at m.a.t.s

How ya doing i hope you are doing great and lots of love from the Netherlands see you soon
13:43 is Till it‚Äôs over by Tristam it‚Äôs also in the game Just shapes and beats.
That song after Crab Rave sounds so familiar... Like one different song I've heard before :thinking:
Wow 23 hours ago and this is part of the 4.8k comments and this is the 39 for gaming trending

Dance your way to freedom!
Monster cat is BAE

Hey jack! You remember the VR game Rec Room? It has completely changed since the last time you played it and it might be worth a look!
Jack dont worry I suck too!
I recognize a few of the songs you played Jack, especially the ones with few/no lyrics in the song
im better than you at this game cause I beat expert+ mode on all levels
play legens never die
dye ur hair red
LIFE IS STRANGE 2 EPISODE 3 PLEASE
The index will obviously be better, seeing as it costs $600 more than the rift s
I'm waiting for the day Jack makes Beat Saber exercise videos.
Jacksepticeye you should try expert mode. I have done it and it is easy and fun.
Wach batdad
Meka widio subnautica below zero
Play tabs again
I wouldn't be suprised if his heart rate was always 600 bpm
The wind on the mic was rather distracting, Cant remember if it was in the other vids but cant unhear it now
I used to listen to a lot of monster cat in school. Forgot how good it was.
God damn that nostalgia
Is it just me or I can barely see what he is doing in the first one. Like he is to jumpy and shakey and looks down. üòè
how did I just get the notification
Sometimes YouTube is really mean to me
please let your hair grow viking length it can never be too much

I think i'm ready to earn my stripes he says (drives down stairs)
Now he needs to do Skate 3 and Minecraft, and the universe will be complete.


Great vid, dude! I really wanted you to come back to the game, and I was not disappointed! Keep it up!

If it goes well, us fans will band together to get you that sponsorship! 
Jack: crashes every ten seconds
No doubt if Jack does that racing one he's going to have that Deja Vu song.
you should play Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer and try going on the road between Calais and Duisburg on EU2 xD Great Video :D

You could just play ETS2 (Euro truck simulator) and download a mode for coke and deliver coke
Your Hopes And Dreams hahaha! gotta love Robin!
Watching this while drinking a Coke zero vanilla... Bit of a weird coincidence üòÇüòÇ
There is a game called "Automation" that lets you build your own car from the ground up, then you can export them to beamNG ! I would love to see some of the designs you'd come with !

Edit : Thanks for the likes everyone, now I hope Jack will like the game and play it on video !
"I am the greatest Cola delivery driver the world has ever seen!"

You came back to one of my favorite games on my birthday Jack
Like my dad told me: The car‚Äôs not in control. You‚Äôre in control of the car. 

Jack, your driving is superb. Lol. üòÇüòÇ
You should play more sneak thief, there are loads more levels




(Like so jackaboy can see)
Actually didn't click in this video for a few days because I saw the game and assumed it was from years ago that I already watched üòÇüòÇ

Does Everyone Remember When He Played This Game A Lot Back Then?
Jack I have a question




Are you growing your hair out? Because if so, I am too! I just started about a month ago!
Also, nice haircut Jack.
Hey @Jacksepticeye you should try coke now with zero sugar and a taste of vanilla orange goodness. (It tastes like a bubbly dreamsicle)

Imagine Jack driving around delivering pizzas and screaming at the same time
Dad was supposed to get his truck license working, but after his first practice drive the guy who was coaching him chose his own survival and lied to the boss that he was done. So if my dad could learn on the job, so can you, Jack! x,D

(Don't worry, he got the hang of it. Six months later he was doing dumb tricks and risking... His.... Life. .... Don't worry, he no longer drives a truck! ;v;)
Is it just me or are soft body physics the best
I totally recommend the DH hyper bolide mod and a very fast car mod.

Jack is already sponsored by Coke, hence why he plugs the all the time, and the "sponsor me please" thing is just a gag.

There's actually a mod that if you go to slow you explode, you should try it.
Idk if you care but when the rear drive axle broke it really is the main but the front CV still worked turning it into a front wheel drive essentially.

Come on coke just give him the sponsor
You haven‚Äôt played this game in years, I‚Äôm glad you are back

Weirdly started watching you because of your 2nd or 3rd on this back in the day, always laughed my ass off the way you said wheels

Was it just me or did anyone else get a Coca-Cola zero sugar peach ad play?
I missed this series

And I love it





You can guess why
Hey Jack, if you're back in BeamNG, download Herbie the Love Bug! He looks like a lot of fun and I think you'd enjoy him.
this is a video from jack why coke should sponsor him
How did he really miss the opportunity for ‚ÄújacksepticPie‚Äù for his pizza business are you kidding me
Please do more of this!
Only people who watched BeamNG before can like this.
JACK WE NEED mayhem!
I love this game please play it more jack
Is it me or is Se√°n sounding a little extra Irish this episode?
Sean is an honorary CarBoy
Not every day that you get a coke delivery from a gealic gladiator

This was so unbelievably Irish.
Sleep is the loading screen! (Containers and palm trees)

Morning is when the the world loads (1 asset left)

 ERROR ERROR ERROR
Play more of this game
2:14 That's not even a spoiler. It's a wing. Spoilers are used to increase the vehicle's acceleration, where as Wings are used to slow the car down when turning a sharp corner. Quit being a damn normie and do research about the subject before playing a game about it.
Nothing like watching jackaboyman playing BeamNG Drive, and getting a Kia Motors America ad.
Jack really would love american/european truck simulator
Do you remember a couple of years ago when a couple of kids asked you in pennies if you were real. That was me
My 6 year old son asked for a coke zero and I was like why a coke zero and not a regular one and then I thought about it and asked if it was because of Jacksepticeye and he was like yeah. COME ON COKE! ITS WORKING! GIVE HIM THE SPONSORSHIP!!!
Do more LAUGH videos
THE MAN IS BACK!
Limber loose rubber goose
YES! JACK FINNALY USED THE HIGHFIVE INTRO! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH JACK!
YESSSS BEAMNG DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should also look into some more mad max everyone loves it.
Pizza ads be like 7:32
15:20 insert mincraft_potion_mp3
They have Orange vanilla coca cola with zero sugar :3
the same great taste, but with zero sugar and touch of cherry vanilla
I cant wait until you mess with the flying cars and all of the gravity settings again
Next happy wheels 100 parts
If u think it was a while before you played this, get back to KSP
JACK PLS PLAY MORDHAU WITH ROBIN!!
I drank a Pepsi while watching this
I like coke cola especially the new vanilla flavor but the Coke Zero is nasty üò∑
ITS BEEN SO LONG
Jack I like your vids, but I gotta be honest, I watch Beam ng to see shit crash. I mean you driving around is cool and all, but a little more crashing would be satisfying.
I thought you were always on coke Jack? Sure seems like it!
Jack I'm sorry I have some awful news, the coke truck you delivering the great coke with zero sugar in sadly was didn't have a hint of vanilla, I'm so sorry
Like a bossss!!!!!
Oh dont worry jack there will be fizz after that drive
i thought jack never hearth a comment
Sean; Show em that Jack‚Äôs pizza is the best in the business!
Me; Hun, sweetheart, doll. You‚Äôre driving down stairs.
I'm rich (roblox)
I miss Jack playing games like this. üòÇüòÇ
Do a anther vid on bmg
HE IS BACK!!!!
Jack, if I want to order pizza, I'll make sure to NOT call for your delivery services...But your speed does keep the pizza warm.


Jack: Delivering coke, sees small child, asks child if they want a tasti-cola with the same great coke flavor now with no added sugar and a hint of vanilla. Child says no, hits child with tasti-cola truck. Job well done.
Omg its been SOOOOOOOO LONGGGGGGG
The loading times are crap but it's usually worth it.
Jackie boy ya gotta do more of this and a lot of crashy smashy :)
Jack: we did a dam jump me: I don‚Äôt give a dam!

5:18 are you garguys MAD? üòÇ
There is actually a speed scenario in this game, you're in a bus and tasked with getting to a certain place without going under a certain speed, can't remember the name though
No One:
Jack: It's the same great cola taste but now with zero sugar
Did you shave your head you beautiful man

Same great taste, zero cola
I don't understand why you have "Coke with the same great Coca-Cola taste with zero sugar and added vanilla" as a running gag in your videos.
Jacksepticeye reminds me of my dad because he has the EXACT same beard as him lol
Did that remind anyone else of the old game Crazy Taxi

Sean I thought u said this was every ones channel but u won't even reply to a txt asking for advice even though it shows u saw it
Please bring this series back
Hell ya jack is playing beam and drive again 1 like for jack
Honestly, this takes me back to when I was 14 watching the original beam ng videos and I'm glad to see a classic series make a return
Next time try to be a cop
Being an automotive technician, and realizing some people don't know what a driveshaft does is absolutely insane to me, until I realize some people just don't give a shit about cars üòÇüòÇ
I have not watched you in YEARS
SALLY FACE!!!! PLEASE
SPEED IS KEY!
Hey my names phillip
It's my first time to see your long beard and your hair

10/10 advertising

10/10 empty bottle :p
Hey look guys he's kratos
nice video mate
Used to always wait for these videos to get uploaded and every now and then I‚Äôd go back n watch it lol glad it‚Äôs back
Please more

Is it just me or was any one else binge watching his old videos on this game and then get the notification that he made this one
No it is Kristy crab Pizza is the best pizza
I REQUESTED THIS 5 YEARS AGO.
i still remember that time you got a krabby patty kart back in 2013 or something
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOR 3 YEARS!!!!!!! YESSSSSSS
Captain jack we are ready to fire the nostalgia beam.
I missed it
Plz stop try hard accent
I don't know if it is just me, but your Irish accent is coming out more. It is weird to see that when you started you didn't let the accent come out and now it is a strong accent (although it has been for a while). GOOD JOB!
I think the lesson we all can take from this is that gamers shouldn't be trucker's and Trukers shouldn't be gamers
I'm not gonna lie, but this looks like GTA, Skate 3 and Forza put together ü§£
Jack I love your vids keep up the good work and I have watched you for 4 years and you‚Äôre videos never get old are boring to me that‚Äôs all and have a great day
When is the SLAP CHOP video coming.......?

Please keep playing this game! I really love it and so do my friends!
Did you hear about the guy who got fired from the Cola bottling plant? It‚Äôs embarrassing, they caught him shelving coke in the break room.

Just like she said
That pizza delivery was realistic
I thought for a second this video was by graystillplays
I know you say it a lot but is it REALLY same coke taste? If it is I might have to try it
a rear driveshaft is what is making your rear wheels spin.
Why is there like a grainy effect   on the screen
YESSSS
"Do you think the best people in the world are the prettiest? No."

Well, this was a nostalgia trip drive

Finally, now Kerbal space program 

Edit: btw we in Italy don‚Äôt use pepperoni on our pizza. We sometimes, rarely put spice salame.
Is anyone else slightly annoyed that he called the VW beetle an Italian car?
I think his pizza shop should be called "jackseptic-pies"
HIS HAIR
Funny Jack is not a car guy

if you are curious what side of the road they drive on check the sighs and intersection paint the placement of the stop signs is prominently on the right as well as the STOP paint on the road therefore it stands to reason that you are correct they do drive on the right side there

And music too.
Those dislikes were the people who were psychopaths who were in the purge.
Jack: taking pictures
Me: sitting in the couch shoving doritos in my mouth and drinking big red with the volume all the way up on my head phones
3 things that happened today:
(1) My neighbours said they didn't like Jack's voice
(2) My neighbours got hit by a bus
(3) I lost my bus license
"Look at it, just sittin' there...staring...oh, it's so cute!"
Me: Yes you are.

Jack: what's up Jim. 
Me: has flashback

Flashback:

Me: I DON‚ÄôT TRUST THIS!!!
i was to busy blushing from the intro to be jumpscared
I felt so happy because of the intro it made me really happy I don‚Äôt know why
Game: "Don't come closer to the body, it's not what you think it is!  It's...a dead man..."
Me: "B*tch, that's exactly what i thought it was."
Jack tells you that you're cute when you're in toilet.
Really?

Jack: Is a professional YouTuber 

Also Jack: Has Duck Tape on his chair
When he said subway, I looked at my broccoli and cheese soup from subway and I thought to myself, what a coincidence...üòÇ

Me:oh shit here we go again
Sean: "This really is a stairway to heaven-the eagles were right!"
Me: "Wrong band, but you got the spirit! :D"

Jack woke that man up. He then to complain to Jack when he fell over and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it and fell back to sleep where he landed.
That opening warmed my heart so much
this intro was uncomfortable
"if its written in blood its serious." jacksepticeye 2019. 10:50
In hindsight, watching this at 1 am with my husband sleeping next to me and all the lights of WASN‚ÄôT the best idea...

I just noticed that the magnifying glass in the spooktective game is like the mirror from Bendy Chapter 5
Not gonna lie, when Jack looked at the camera, called me cute and took my picture...my heart skipped a beat
Dia in Indonesian means him / her .
Why does that thumbnail ghost remind me of Napstablook from Undertale?
Why does my mom say that same intro every time I come out of my room

ODD1sOUT will make a great sandwich for u
10:16
I couldn't have possibly been the only one to expecting Anti to show up at that part
....or maybe I'm just deprate...
This was a fun video to watch nevertheless!
Jack always makes me laugh.

18:26
Does that hat say detective Pikachu on it?
0:00 CRINGE COMPILATON TIME (pewds meme)

9:47 that was kind of what they did with alien isolation. Using that radars system.
Jack: No it has a population of Uno, but that's a card game, that doesn't even mean anything.

Me: tHaT MeANs oNe in SPanIsH
Long time Jacksepticeye fans remember his old grey hat
the intro made me cry-
The intro made me feel special
So uhhh that one transition reminded me...has Chase been impersonating Jack who is in a coma for like a year now?
Please play "don't close your eyes" it's a survival horror game!
If jack ever does anti at a meet up would someone pleeeeease had him a snickers.... Its for the research...
jokes on you. im already in my hole.
That intro made me grin like a fool, and blush...
you've aged well after adding 14 years
Jacksepticeye is the world's greatest detective

Dia means : he/she in Malay, just saying :)
DIA! JOTARO!
‚ÄúMy God... this really is a stairway to heaven... The Eagles were right!‚Äù - Jacksepticeye talking about a song by Led Zeppelin 2019

Oh please let Anti be in the next scary games video.
I died at the beginning xD
Me : how Mny steps did you take to day

The intro to this video both made me laugh and freaked me out! I loved it!
Jack makes all of the horror games not scaryüòÑ
Ok jack, you deserve the like because of the intro. Thanks for calling us cute bud.
My goldfish is sleeping





End me
all the way!!!!!
Please do more prop hunt jacky boy
That intro is everything! I love that he knew I was starting at his soul, looking through the screen, hearing his thought... Watching his every move... Even after the camera is off... I. Am. Always. Watching. I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY. DON'T WORRY. I CAN PROTECT YOU... A L W A Y S. . . . .
*We have to repopulate the city?
Im down with that*
Lol
0:31 voice break xD
The intro killed me
I'm starting to notice more and more subtle anti things.
lol the begining made me happy
JACK THERE'S NEW SLIMES IN SLIME RANCHER PLEASE RECORD SOME OF THEM!!! üòÅüòÅ
Maybe this is why  Subway delivers nowüëåüëåüëå
Jack saying stuff like ‚Äúwelcome~‚Äù and the camera stuff made me laugh but his boo made me choke on air as I was laughing >.<
in Indonesia "Dia" mean "she/he"
Dia means day in Spanish
Well in Indonesia DIA means she/he
Coincidence!.i think not
In moment when Jack changing games, I even think that Anti is back :c
That intro made me feel great!
I thought the thumbnail was a strange Diglett from Pok√©mon
you took the first 2 games from the kubz scouts
At 10:28 I heard the voice and I thought anti was back so I was like "anti yes I missed you"
cough Led Zeppelin cough
You made me laugh
"you might spook it, it might go back into its hole"
me: I'm already in my hole, dammit
Well, I was naked while watching this (don't ask) and now I'm paranoid about Sean stalking me enough that I dreamt about him perving around
ANTI‚ÄôS BACK!
but how an there be two for life and two for death because that would make it four lines dude
Jack: look at it its so beautiful...its so cute

Me: * chokes on chips *
Me: I smell anti ( :‚Äô))
Jack: Look at it, it‚Äôs so cute. *Snap*( Take a picture)
0:22 
I AM READY
I AM PREPARED
I AM READILY PREPARED
I AM GOING TO SURVIVE
Two Lines was the portrayal of purgatory after suicide, that was deep and amazing
When he said I‚Äôm beautiful I did the 
Middle finger üñïüèø sorry jack
What kind headphones does Jack wear? Anybody?
The magnifying glass on the third game
Made the ghosts
DETECTIVE
That intro was the best
OMG I HAVEN'T WATCHED JACK IN SO LONG BUUUT THAT LITTLE PONYTAIL IS SO CUUUTTTEEE
'D√≠a' means 'day' in Spanish, so that might be where it comes from.
Awwww, jack called me cute~
0:14 I felt weird because I was actually sitting 
On a chair
Staring
At Jack
That was weird okay...
4:51 I thought he was going to say 0 sugar with added vanilla...
(/^-^(^ ^*)/(„Å§‚úßœâ‚úß)„Å§
The 2nd game (Two Lines) is about suicide. Your character slit their wrists in the bath (each wrist is a line), died, and 'woke up' in a purgatory/hell, where they're just being chased in a barren city by a monster. I think the monster represents the realization of what you did, because it shows up when you find your body again. The cycle then repeats, probably for eternity.
The last game was just delightful
10:12 ...Anti? I might just be imagining things but I feel like I heard some backwards audio in this part.. and then Jack talked about the darkness he had been in for 14 years which could be related to the "coma" he's in or something? Idk, but we need an investigator on this case
I WANT ANTI BACK FK SAKE
Dia is day in portuguese
Taibhse is ghost in Irish.üëåüáÆüá™
Jack you are the sweetest üíö
"You might spook it back into its hole"
Me: hiss

Getting Anti vibes from this
That was a good intro.
Getting an antisepticeye felling from this video
No Jack ur getting greys
Anyone else went to see if dia actually meant god?

Well i googled it and it does
What was in the magnifine glass at the end of the video
I.. what a cute intro
0:13 Jokes on you Jack, I was doing homework
Creator of the second game came a long way from being a game developer
0:07 Jack: "it's so beautiful" 
Me: stuffing my face with a grilled cheese sandwich XD
Dia in portuguese means Day, so it's weird for me too lol Bom Dia means Good Morning and Dia alone means Day, so knowing it means God in Irish is also pretty weird
the intro made me happy ^v^
Jack I'm going to Ireland for the first time. You got any recommendations?
can he bring the flatcap back?
"I was in da darkness for fourteen years! "
Me: Did you find anti?
Can you do Another Astronear 
series

Yo Sean! I got a game suggestion for you! It‚Äôs great, idk if you heard of it or not. 

Danganronpa.

I feel like you would like it UwU
i tought we were gonna talk about the fact that diglet was everywhere
As you can see jack has caught a wild viewer they are not becoming extinct anytime soon
The beginning was so wholesome
The only think I've killed are bugs. And that was in self defense.
It's so hard to take Jack seriously with a Detective Pikachu hat on... XD
Not that it wasn't already a Challenge.
Led Zeppelin got it right they made Stairway To Heaven. The Eagles made Hotel California.
dia means him/her in malay
0:33 - RIP headphone users.

Jack 30 is not old
Jack is the only one keeping me sane at the moment. He is hilarious and energetic and awesome, i love his content like this if you love jack
Anybody else actually get spookedfied at the end
lol that made me smile in the beginning of the video.
Is it just me or is Jake starting to look like the Father from far cry?
I don‚Äôt know why but that Uno joke really got to me. Ridiculous. Love you Sean!
The beginning made me so happy lol, I'm so starved of affection üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇ AND THEN YOU RUINED IT YA BASTARD üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Um i gusse i have not watched jack in a longgg time now he has a beard and a pony tail mhhm
Septiplier is back guys
The trash can is my home, no trespassing
Jack: "Dia" means "God"
Me: MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA
I wonder what's going on in his mind when he does those intros.
When jack does not start with, top of the morning to you lady‚Äôs
8:50 looks like something from. Resident Evil
I'm not scared when he yells in used to it but it's the best youtube channel ever
DIA ni pandai buat lawaklah!!

Population 1 - just like the mind of a sociopath!!

I kept thinking anti was goin to show up
1:30 thats what she saidüòä
ITS ANTI!!
Chill Anti you don‚Äôt need to take over Jack/Sean you just need to take over the video
wouldn't it be 4 lines then??? two for life and two for death.
We're all gonna POP OFF
You will not take me alive
Change your computer name to sean
Jack I have on no pants! You can't take pictures!
Did he say stairway to heaven was by the Eagles
Jacks gone grey
Are you trying to a beard contest something
Dia in Spanish means day if you wanted to know jacksepticeye.
I'm flattered
Dia is god in Irish.
Dio is god in Italian
both language names start with same letter and those two words start with same 2 letters. 
Dio is jojo's bizzare adventure villain. 

jojo reference confirmed
Kenzie Katch has entered DIA
DIA sangat takut. If you know Malay you'll understand.
Jack: WOW look at it ... It's so beautiful 
Me: ...üòÆüò∂üò≥... really? 
Also me: starts balling üò≠üò≠‚ù§‚ù§
0:11: Hey! I'm not an exhibit! XD
Lol when he was taking the pic of the viewer i put it on my sandwich
0:33 
Me: huh? What happen. Eh
22:42 omg sean sounds like stewie Griffin
Jack:just look at it sitting there, staring OH ITS SO CUTE!
ME: Takes off my mask and looks at it You think so? I was going for edgy.
Why does jack look like Joseph seed from farcry
0:33 Sean you think that scared us?
you've been screaming at us for years,
there's no way that would scare any of your fans
This is probably dumb, but Jack pointing to the camera and saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs beautiful‚Äù in such a genuine way made me absurdly happy. Like, I know he wasn‚Äôt talking about me specifically - he‚Äôs never even seen me irl, so he can‚Äôt actually be complimenting me....but it made me happy anyway :D
I‚Äôm ready coz I didn‚Äôt get scared üòÇ by ‚ÄúBOO!!!!!‚Äù
I saw the thumbnail and was like, is that napsterblook?
I am actually deff and I can hear my self
first not first
UNO is 1in Indonesian
What headphones do you use jackaboy? :/ I really want to know hahaha.
uummm jack... Uno is Spanish for the number 1
Dia in Spanish means Day
I felt so happy until he spooked the shit outta' me
I didn't get jump scared once, I was prepared because I knew this was a Jacksepticeye video.
Uno is Spanish for one. Therefore, it means something.
My father always pronounced it "dee-a dith", but okay.

(Yes, I do know that it is not spelt by any sane and sober person like that - that being said,when using the Latin alphabet Gaelic doesn't look at all like it was conjured up by a sane or sober person  - but that is how he pronounced it, not spelt.)
Easy Breezy, Cover Girl
In Malaysia Dia means him/her/it
I'm eating ofood while I watch this to help me with the scarriness of the video but it's probably a bad idea
Two lines i feel is about death and your soul, you were rinning from the grimm reaper, from a parralle    world(purgatory) to the real world  where u died. When  you were caught.  Its got a really deep meaning
I'm starting to think that jse got rid of green hiar just so we couldn't tell the green screen
When he said that uno means nothing I was like uno means one in Spanish
That Intro Just Made my day after finally getting Out of the Hospital üòåüòäü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú
You thought it was dia but it was me DIO
it three random horror games
Am I the only one who posed when he took a pic of the camera C,:
The camera flash spooked me back into my hole
Dia means him/her in Indonesia
I was waiting for Anti to show up
the boo in the start didnt even spook me cuz i was sniffing my arm lol
For educational use only
Where u in albiquarky
5:31 I was eating jack why
I'm gonna pretend I didn't need that validation sksk
Why do I feel like we're just gonna get trolled with Anti until he actually shows up for about 5 minuets then leaves for a few more months again
That intro made me feel more special than creeped out.
Thanks Jacküëç
jack has the oiliest eyelids I've ever seen
OMG. That was new lol
HEy man I saw the system of a down cover    AWESOME.  The first heavy alternative metal song I really enjoyed was stinkfist by tool WOuld really enjoy if you tried it :)
I laughed when you said boo
Jack, you should put the pulse monitor thing in every scary game video. 
Like so he can see
I just realized your youtube channel cam out 2 days after I was born!!!    ^o^
Im playing Minecraft whilst watching this
"I didn't want to bust out the bad language"
That card game the name meens one in Spanish
JACK: ssshhhh don't spook it back into its hole.
ME: innocent jack I'm already in my hole
14:47 im not watching this from a tv..

21:33
Dia in indonesia means = him/her
0:32 Jesus Christ
Dia also means "day" in spanish...
"We're also here to make our voices crack...GODDAMMIT!üòÇüòÇ
Jack play an SCP game because when you know what you should do you will have a lot of fun
14:10 Dee?
How did Jack not come up with ‚ÄúFor I am Jack Specter-eye‚Äù instead of Jack Spookly lol
0:00-0:30
Oh Jack, how do you always manage to make me happy, even when I'm filled with emotional and physical pain?
dia means him or her or it in malay~
in the second game that‚Äôs you dead in the bathtub and you‚Äôve been running away from the grim reaper lmao
0:46 Horror games, as narrated by Beatrice.
SO MANY STAIRS
Jack: ‚Äú look at it sitting there starring ‚Äú
Me: *eating cheese doodles ear buds in  * uhhh ok

0:18 !!EPILEPSY WARNING!!
9:34 That reminds me of Sword art online for some reason.

12:24 the best reaction
You were gone for 14 years?
Man do you age well
Jack needs Jesus...
in latin dia is day, also in spanish.
6:10 dia smuire dhuit, t√° m√© go maith
It was me! Dia!
Damn Jack, stop taking pictures of me! You're better looking!
We can still see some green from the logo on the chair
7:08: Umm, what? J-Jack, Is there, heh, Is there something you're not telling us there, buddy?
Did jack tape his chair or something?
I sneezed at the beginning of the video when he pointed at the camera saying "beautiful one". People usually run away when I sneeze thinking something exploded. Thanks Sean, no one appreciates sneezing like you do.
‚ÄúThis really is a stairway to heaven.  The Eagles were right!‚Äù  Oh Jack...  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
0:00 at first I was like is he playing fatal frame??
Two Lines is about a man caught in a never ending loop after killing himself (and possibly some other people.)
I now want to see jack playing cluedo in his new snazzy Sherlock Holms outfit !!!!!!!!
0:33 if that got you, you must be new to the channel
My day was so sh**y that intro made my day 100 times better. Thank you S√®an
I swear to God I've seen Dia years ago or that monster in the same scenario. I don't know know but I swear to God I've seen this before a long time ago.
where's Anti?
Sean trying to get that subway mun
10:47 Wait if there are 2 lines and were tethered to together that means there's one line..? u messed that yo hardcore jack
"you're just sitting there, staring"

Damn, ok sorry Sean you didn't have to do me like that.
21:32 anyone know who that is
Jack your like sam from life is sarng
when he said is this the purge my town has their test Syrians on right now
The detective pikachu hat tho
Strong anti vibes but also I love the way Jack talks to his audience more. X
Am I the only one who got excited at 10:15 because I thought it was going to be Anti
DIA: It's a Doctor Who monster. It's only trying to say hi... By ripping your face off & making you eat it.
JACCUSE
u drank water and i am fasting
Jack ilysm thanks for making wholesome content üíïüíï
surprisingly his earrape boo didn't get me
0:31 I was getting a water bottle and now my carpet is very watery
Well I get scared not that easily
11:23 I know what happens so u better run boi cuz I saw jay play these two games so far
Jacks intro made me smile so much that I didn't even realise he tried to scare me until a 7 second delayed reaction lmao.
BOO!!
Uno means 1 in spanish
my f*ckin' eyes
Anyone from Detroit think Detroit Institute of Arts? (DIA) I certainly did.
Anyone else notice that Jack is saying feck a lot more recently?
wow great intro
If anyone was wondering, the music in the Spooktective game is called The Alchemist's Tower by Derek & Brandon Fiechter. It's labeled as Spooky music but it's great for imagining an alchemist for a story.
where will he pop out of now? Door number one, Door number two, or all around you?
Jack: Oh look how cute that is!
You're cuter.
Ur in love
at 18:30 the moment he said go and HBO go ad just popped up made me laugh so hard
At 10:10did anyone notice that it was anti talking
Look up dbh on red ice
Wait, so how old is Antisepticeye?
makes the absolute stupidest face when he says beautiful
TOMMOROW LIFE IS STRANGE S3 E3 COMES OUT PLS PLAY IT
23:57 there is antisepticeye (and if you look in the magnifying glass you're also gonna see....nothing)
10:42
Jack: We have to solve this once and for all!
Me: Or.....you could just press quit.
My last meal I want to be chpoiltlay
I‚Äôm looking through the comments to avoid the horror üòÇ
I'M GOING FULL SCREEN
WHO'S WITH ME???!?!?


if you are please help
I'm scared it's too spoopy
oun means one
When he looked at us I was expecting him to say "This one's going in my cringe compilation"
Dia means he or she in malay
In Spanish d√≠a means day
real background
14:12 I take offense ya know.
0:31 
Ok but I am kinda used to these sudden jumpscares... After all a Jacksepticeye video is never complete without 'em. 
(*I AM ALWAYS READY*)
did he just say that uno ( that means 1 in italian) means nothing
10:06 that also mean Aunty in spanish
I'd populate with you Jack wink wink
No one : ...
Hulk : I hate stairs
0:12 jack:look at that one is so beautiful me:why thank you
Dia in malay actually mean him
For a swearing, horror gaming, Irish man, hes so wholesome.
this did not scare me
Anyone that didn't pose for Jack at 0:19, you're doing life wrong.
Stop taking pictures of me I‚Äôm not a giraffe
i thought the intro was lovely and it made me happy until he fucking jump scared me and made my heart stop, i don‚Äôt know what i was expecting to be fair i knew the real jack was coming soon
Looks like blooky to me
Just saying, the intro is creepy if you are sitting on a toilet
I‚Äôve been gone for like a month it feels like it was meant to be
*Sees hat and spyglass *
Wait... Could this have any new egos?
*clicks violently *
There's nothing scarier (funnier) than being scared (pleasantly surprised) by a dead corpse (floppy silly ragdoll) around every corner.

This game's story reads out like a parody of horror... Was this supposed to be satire? idk. I can't even tell anymore these days.
Jack do you know Gaelic???  Ya know old time Irish
Sean: boo
Me: ok so was you trying to scare me or... cuz it‚Äôs normal that u are yelling
Where's that fabulous "Top o' the morning to ya laddies! My name is JackSepticeye and welcome to (insert game title here)," Jackaboy!
not gonna lie the intro made me feel super nice, thank you jack for looking after my self-esteem <3
It GoT mE. . . but don't tell anyone
I was expecting the boo only because its jack who doesn't expect a loud scream from jack
21:33 that‚Äôs a picture of SCP 2521 (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢|‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢|‚Ä¢‚Ä¢|‚Ä¢)
tender loins
It did not get me
scared sounds in introvert
I feel like Sean would be a very good actor if he was given the chance.
He is just sleep twitching
Jack: The game gods are listening to me
Me: A million people are listening to you and your funniness! ü§£üëçü§£
My battery is on 69
Hey jack hope your having a great day but if you can that would be cool to record or Livestream some counter-strike global offensive dangerzone which is now a battle royal and I think you might like it
Dia means day in Spanish
I found a rpg-maker style horror game you might like called Close Your Eyes, not to be confused with the vr title of the same name
Person: Why did you come here 

Sean: I don't know I just wanted FEKING SANDWICH
Hey Mia is my name and dia rhymed
At 12:28 I thought he said my name, then I realized he said matheson not Madison
For anyone wondering: Yes, this game actually takes place in the Fran Bow universe.
Misfortune:This is the rock daddy threw to me.
Everyone: surprised Pikachu face
OMG I just realized that "Eternal Happiness" and an "Eternal Reward" are used to describe death.
MISFORTUNE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NARRATOR WHY.
When misfortune was on the the road, the only thing going through my head was:
GET OFF THE ROAD!
dude i saw the stone and thought it was adorable. 

it looked like from the floor, she drew brown hair on him. 

im crying now
Black cat: Exists
Me: mR. mIdNiGhT
Jack: doesn't take the chance of that joke
"I sHoWeD iT tHe FiNgEr AnD iT nEvEr CaMe BaCk-" -words of a wisdom
I don‚Äôt trust Mr. Voice.... 


Comment if u agree!

Also, love u jack! (No hetero)
Please do a full play though when it comes out please
Is she allowed to have feelings for animals? Well beastiality is illegal because animals can't give/understand consent, but that fox doesn't seem to be like other foxes. Technically the fox is a pedophile...


Well THAT'S a twist!
Misfortune: I wanna be a juice drinker

Me: yikes forever
"A fox a criminal? That's silly..."

Swiper: e.e
Misfortune: Hello diary! Is it ok to have feelings for a fox?

BEASTIALITY: 100
Misfortune: makes a choice

Narrator: there will be CONSEQUENCES‚Äî
1:02 The heads hanging by their hair from fran bow!
And they turn into those butterfly things!
MEMORIES
Newcomers : what's Fran bow

Old timers : Let me tell you a dark horrific story....
Me:YAY PICK THE STONE
Misfortune:daddy threw the stone at me
Me:bro how about the unicorn instead...
"I might need the coloring book to fight monsters and Kim Kardashin" 

Lol left me in tears
how did you manage to drag this 10 minute demo into a 30 minute long video
"That's a PMA attitude right there."
POSITIVE! 
MENTAL!
ATTITUDE!!!!!
She's so sweet.. but I'm terrified something awful is gonna happen to her, hhhhhhhhhh.
I feel like the Eternal Happiness is death.
I was thinking he sounded familiar and later I was like ‚ÄúYooo he sounds like that dude from Teddy‚Äôs Operation!‚Äù üòÇ
Sean: i need that soft soothing buttery sultry voice.
me: NOOOO YOURE GOOD!!! YOU KEEP THAT IRISH ACCENT!!!!
You still remember Fran Bow...






I've never been so happy in my LIFE UwU
Narrator :
Lol you on the other side of the scree- 

Jack: OH BENJAMIN'

narrator are you listening to me ;-;
Fran Bow - talking animals
Little Misfortune - Misfortune has feelings for a FOX




The developers are secretly furries q-q
I wonder if Fran Bow and Misfortune will meet in this game. An easter egg is fine with me if the devs add it indicating its connected to Fran Bow.
Apparently this takes place in the same universe as Fran Bow 
There‚Äôs a few Easter eggs like the hanging heads and the pine cone dude
Why does Misfortune souded like Groot from Despicable me????
Mr. Voice sounds like he would be the cat in Fran Bow. O.O
Jack:*picks rock*
Misfortune: this was the rock daddy threw at me once
Jack 's face: ‚Ä¢‚óã‚Ä¢
What if the mother is Fran Bow? That could be the reason why Misfortune could see things? :O
Jack: hey you, on the other side of the screen-OH LOOK THERES BENJAMIN!!!!!!!!!!!
man id be pumped to see jack play this upon full-release
You can trust me even though I lied to you about dying today...
"Is it ok to have feelings for a fox?"
furry
...can we just call her "Ms. Fortune"? Cause to think her parents couldn't even come up with a better name than the one she has...
GODDAMMIT JACK YOU BROKE THE RULE YOU MENTIONED FIGHT CLUB damn now I broke it
jack: those look like the hanging heads from fran bow
me:THEY ARE
Modern-day indie games have taught us all a valuable lesson...

Never trust cute things

Also:
 "This is like My Little Pony fanfiction"
Corrected that statement for you Jack. You're welcome.
"A fox criminal, that's silly..!"

Swiper The Fox has left the chat
Misfortune: walks on the road and background changed 
Me: YIKES FOREVER
Misfortune: This is the rock daddy threw at me. 

Me: Yikes forever.
At first I thought the fox was Swiper but hHHhHHh 

i was wrong :')
I think Santa is a parallel to God in this world. Misfortune mentioned about not believing in him bc if he could give gifts to everyone, why not the poor people? It's the same with how people feel about God. If God is real, why make all those people suffer? 

Nice parallel
Game: Her name is Misfortune.
Me: HAH! THAT'S THE NAME OF AN UNWANTED CHILD RIGHT THERE!!
Game: She is an unwanted child.
Me:
1:36 witches that are stuck in a tree and tiny pinecones people Easter egg from Fran bow
The way she's talking reminds me of Laura Bailey's character in Crit Role campaign 2 <3
she cute 
she wonderful 
but most importantly

she throw glitter to evewythin'
Little Misfortunes voice reminds me of vendetta from making  Fiends
A fox criminal, that‚Äôs silly

Swiper: Am I a joke to you?
Bro I'm actually obsessed now!!! I NEED THIS GAME!! I'm so excited!!!
my gut could not handle the ‚Äúfive days‚Äù and her tripping üò≠üò≠üòÇ
1:02 I JUST REALIZED! This is (probably) a reference to the heads that get stuck in trees in Fran Bow!
21:30 is that a Dora the explorer reference in this game? üòÇ
The Narrator sounds a lot like Professor Layton, tho
1:56 The hanging skulls in Fran Bow, you needed to brush their hair to get them out of the tree
4 minutes in, I'm already crying. 10/10
23:40
Everyone:OH ITS GETTING SCARY
Me:GET OFF THE DAMM ROAD
Jack: I hate glitter!
*Gains glitter throwing ability
Jack: *Glitters everything
"She's wonderful, I LOVE her!" Jack have achived "Lolicon" Jk XD
Little Misfortune: Starts talking

Me: Are you female Gru??
Me 2019: I wonder what happens when I touch a grave in the middle of the forest!


1:36
2018 : Wakanda Forever
2019 : YIKES FOREVER
Jack,we can‚Äôt do it

SHE‚ÄôS TOO PURE,WE CAN‚ÄôT
Me: leGIt DiD noBoDY seE ALl tHOsE FraN BoW EaSteR eGGs-
Jack: speaks about the girls that needed their comb in Fran Bow stuck in the tree
Me: FINALLY SOMEONE NOTICED
Misfortune must have some weird fox fetish lol
Jack: hold shift to run?
Immediately trips and falls
Misfortune: a fox criminal? That's silly.

Swiper: am I a joke to you?
If only she named Steven "Ron." Get it? Kim and Ron, fighting evil? No? No one gets it? Aight. You poor souls.
Fran Bow first happened on October
This game happened in October
Misfortune: This is the rock daddy threw at me.

Literally everything existing: And I oo-
Jack : i Hate you Monster


me : buT- UnDERTALE . GOAT MOMA . DON'T YOU REMEMBER ??
Misfortune about Santa: why can't he give poor people water and food? 

That really was a big oomph and dug a deep hole into reality, I felt that :").. that's so true tho... :/
I love foxes XD that's why I love this game, lol ( there's other reasons, too )
Oh my goodness are we guiding a dead child through purgatory to the afterlife in this game??
Why do I have a feeling that Benjamin is gonna kill her?

Edit: I just notice that he said that already XD Oof
Lol jack was singing 99 Red Balloons from Bob's Burgers



Man,I love that show.üòä
Misfortune: foxes can‚Äôt be criminals!
Me: you clearly have never ever seen a single episode of Dora the Explorer
"Is it ok to have feelings for a fox?"
Me: pictures Robin Hood and Nick Wilde
Me: yes..?
I am already loving this game.
My son is in it! Grim! Grim, you're in a KillMondaysGame Game!

Grim: I don't care, Dad! But good for you.
This game is cute and scary plz play it when it release
11:51 so much more respect for Sean now

‚ÄúLike the devil or Kim kardashian‚Äù
Cat: * exists*
Me: mR. mIdNiGhT!
I say tomato, you say tomato 
Jack says ... TAMATUS
well my names erica
guess i just killed my parents
This game looks amazing <3
My aesthetic is just throwing glitter around while everything blows up and gets destroyed
Jack: "I feel like you can throw it [stone] and could do some damage"
Misfortune: "This is the stone my dad threw at me."
Oof.
Video starts.
 *HEY I LOVE THIS SONG!*

Oh yeah, I loved Fran bow. Please play it when it comes out!
I almost cried. I know this is the start to a great game. It's.... so.. deep. " Daddy hit me with a rock ", " Daddy was just mad, it was an accident. " " We had a great meal yesterday, daddy actually said hi to me and mommy wasn't too drunk. "
She's just a child, a very smart one infact, and this world she lives in rubs off on her. Honey, that's not juice. That's alcohol. " Yeah, daddy regularly sleeps in the car. Daddy? " Daddy's not in there, Misfortune. It's just.. so hard. She doesn't understand and that's so hard for me. She just wants everything to he happy. " Eternal happiness? I can give that to mommy. Deal! "
Though, I feel like I will really enjoy this game.
Sha - daan, and happiness for all.
The date on the calendar is my birthday! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
I feel horrible for her

She‚Äôs so precious
21:35  "What?! A fox a criminal? That's silly"




Well someone hasn't seen Dora the Explora-
im my recommended it said are you a sociopath!üò®
Jack: aaaand flower.
Youtube: hello, amd welcome to headspace
demons like the devil or Kim Kardashian (prob misspelled though)
Narrator: "All Foxe's are criminals." 
Me: "Hang on, if Zootopia has taught me anything..."
Little Misfortune sounds like WolfyChu!
I have never clicked a video so fast. Don't know what the game is but I LOVED Fran Bow.
This game has so much potential! Cant wait for the full game!
Jacksepticeye: glitter i hate glliter 

Me covered in glitter:Uhh
PLOT TWIST: HER MOM IS FRAN BOW
teacher: time for a math test
me: yikes forever!
The hanging skulls are the tree people from the time when Fran bow fell in the rabbit hole
im so excited for this game. i love fran bow, so this should be great too. glad you played it, jack!
At 1:32 I just realized that tree is the same one from fran bow where she has to find to comb aand everything
Easter eggs from Fran bow: hanging heads,the pinecone,the drawing of the demon, the green and yellow headless dolls referring to Fran‚Äôs parents,the blue car which was Fran‚Äôs therapist‚Äôs car,And the whole bang bang and the parents dieing is referring to Fran
‚ÄúFran Bow‚Äù

HAPPY SCREECHING
OMMGGG Jack please make this a series üòÇüò≠ I was in love and laughing my ass off it was fantastic
Misfortune sounds like VenusAngelic üò∂
omg theory. the narrator is itward
"A fox criminal? That's crazy"
Me:Trust me kid, you have to watch Dora
she's clementine reborn.. <3
Jackk The legend of brofist was amazing
I'm so excited for this game wow
Narrator: " WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES"
I thought my parents were fighting LMAO 11:35
theres screeching
Eternal happiness and Eternal Reward means death. Poor kid
Monster: * is exiting * 
Misfortune: üñï
I dont know why but I got scared from the intro üòÇüò≠
(First time watching his vids tho , I'm gonna keep watching anyway)
I was taken aback by how much the main character swore, seeing as she seems to be like six years old. Then it dawned on me that it was another subtle indication of how her parents were....
Misfortune: I wanna be a juice drinker!

Me: Big mood‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I love this , you should play the whole game  when it  comes out üî•‚ù§Ô∏è keep up the good work , jack my boii üòÇ
How dare you, Foxes are the best creater in this world
Mr.Voice: fox are criminals 
Me: ... dora?
Girl: Stony
Me: that reference, man
When a fictional character is STILL better at drawing than you
üôÄ
Mr voice sounds like the guy who gave a surgery on a teddy bear
(comes back to visit favorite youtubers that they haven't watched in a while) Me: WORD My boy developing a beard XD
Misfortune can fix vases....
I am super hyped about all this stuff. 
I also agree the new spino looks more like a hypo version.
Game: I love my glliter 

Ad: hEy GooGle
Fran Bow x Life is Strange 
Idk why I just had that feeling
This game hits too close to home for meüòÇü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and foxes are precious! hmph!ü•∫ü¶ä
The Narrator sounds like he belongs to an episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog
In the intro with the fox and that gray cloak guy you see the heads with tangled hair in the tree from Fran bow
OH GOSH I HAVENT SEEN YOUR VIDEOS IN AGES AHHHHHHH
"like the devil, or Kim Kardashian" I'm dead! (If you get my dead! Reference I love you)
MS.FORTUNE FROM SKULLGIRLS
A wonderful child from a not so wonderful family

So basically she's Matilda?
20:48
October 11
That‚Äôs one of my friends borthday üò≥
i want a t-shirt that says "yikes forever"
watches a portal open after touching a random grave
fox: shrugs mkay
22:03 oh my God the cat looks like just the one from Coraline.... some shit is gonna happen
Narrator: You're going to die today!

Little Misfortune: Yikes Forever!
I would actually really like to see the full game!
20:36  The day she's gonna die and leave the house is the day of my birthday 
 
 
 


 
 
 
Thanks for the gift
"Eternal Happiness"? Well that sure doesnt sound suspicious..

....Mr.Voice seems like a nice person....but is he really?
Hey Jack, when you play the real game, whenever you toss glitter over stuff, can you just shout 'BRIGHTEN UP BIACH'
Crazy bad shit happening in the end

Me: .....
Also me: her name is literally ‚Äúmisfortune ‚Äú why are you so surprised?
Like the devil.... Or Kim kardashion..





(Idk how to spell..)
hanging skulls? JACK YOU DOOFUS THEY'DE THE CURIOUS DRAGON FLIES
little miss fortune? more like the child that brings death
Misfortune's voice reminds me of Dexter from Dexter's laboratory, only cuter. (‚óç‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‚óç)
Mr. Voice: Don't worry, you can trust me.
Also Mr. Voice: You know that thing about her dying today, let's keep this our little secret shall we?
Good to see swiper finally found a career after dora
I think the voice might be Benjamin's nemesis or something. He seems to not be fond of foxes
Happiness to everything is now my favorite quote..
Jack: 99 and a half won't do nananannana. 
Me: GASP HE KNOWS CHRISTIAN MUSIC
Jack: who doesn‚Äôt like sushi?
Me: I‚Äôm allergic to sushi and seafood and shellfish üò≠
pls do more misunfortunite because i think everyone would like more
"the prize of eternal happiness is yours"
me:... omg    eternal happiness.... is death
omg... Fran Bow was one of the first playthroughs of Jack's that I watched, and I loved that game
Misfortune : I love Fox
Mister Voice : Foxes are criminals
Misfortune : Mama I‚Äôm in love with a criminal
WHEN YOU SAID GAME YOU SOUNDED EXACTLY LIKE HIM.
NO 
FREAKIN
LIE
Jack:The heads hanging from the trees or from Fran bow.
Me:*notices them first and types*dang it!
Sean: Likes Sushi and hates glitter.
Me: Am I a joke to you?
Im so exited for the full game!!
Misfortune: this is my dairy, nobody is allowed to read

Also Misfortune: wANnA rEaD
Milo Murphy: R rated edition?
His reaction was almost exactly the same as when i first played ddlc lol
Criminal fox? That's silly.



Swiper: why you motherfrasker
No, it's not just glitter,
its
.
.
.
 
Sean talking about the foxes living in his yard is the most precious thing.
Emotional supportyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
5:39
UMM.
HOW DO THEY KNOW MY LAST NAME.
WHOA im rewatching the Stanley Parable, where you called the narrator Mr. Voice
proceeds to throw glitter at everything
The fact that she has a voice makes everything even better üñ§ How adorable
The narrator's voice reminds me a bit of David tennantü§î maybe it's only me
people like stones more than unicorns !?!? ... 

wow first time i knew that
THE TREE FROM FRAN BOW IS THERE THE ONE WI5 THE TANGLED HEADS
Narrator: stony the stone!

My head: FLOWEY THE FLOWER
There are so many Fran Bow references in this demo
.
.
.
I love it.
ok so the portal jump hanging heads and pine cone alllll relate to franbow this game takes place in that universe
That intro was the best thing ever
This feels like a weird mix between Fran Bow and Sally Face because of that soubdtrack of the end
When Jack doesn't realize her name is Misfortune not Miss Fortune ....
21:29 ZOOTOPIA CONFIRMED
1:01
Head dude makes a cameo
Hold up I've been away for a little while when did Jack get so cute-

Also, this whole game looks amazing.
This feels alot like oxenfree!
Her name is MISFORTUNE
Everything around her




is BAD LUCK
Cat: 
Jack:
Misfortune:
Me: Mr midNIGHT
If you think well, she's called 'Misfortune' because she wasn't planned and she was a 'misfortune' to her parents
big OOOOOOOOOOOF I can not fucking wait for this game its like a mix of fran bow and sally face two of my fav of all time this is only the demo but already love this game just as much as those games I will def be keeping up with this.

(ps) did anyone else here the fran bow sound track  or is it just me
Stuff: exists
Jack:let‚Äôs put glitter on it üòÇ
authors: introduces a character
also authors: today, they will die
Jack should name the foxes under his house
Demo theories: I am 100% sure this is in the same universe as Fran Bow. While I am unsure if the stories will connect, I do feel feel they will throw Easter eggs. (Like the heads and the Pinecone)


As for Mr. Voice...I feel it could be either a Grim Reaper like character...
or, and hear me out...
I feel it could be Itward. 
Something just...he seems so kind to Misfortune. He reminds me of Itward...
Y I K E S. F O R E V E R.
play it when it comes out
Girl:i love glitter
Jack:I HATE GLITTER IT'S AN ABOMINATION
''Stoney the Stone''
''Flowey the Flower''
Whats next, ''Misfortune the Misfortunate child''?
I Love it You HAVE to Play it
no but rlly i love her
Voice: i can give you eternal happiness

Me: you mean drugs?
Misfortune: "I'll choose the stone    daddy threw at me."
Jack: enters surprise pikachu face
1:01 OH HAYYY I MISSED YA GUYS! DO YA NEED YOUR COMB?! And I'm watching you, pinecone (this is just my initial reaction)
Misfortune: I choose the stone that daddy threw at me once
Sean: GASP
"gregg from night in the woods sure let himself go"
me:  I KNOW, I WAS ABOUT TO FUKING SAY THAT OML!
Jack needs a bit of a shave, but he still looks fabulous UwU‚ú®
Jack: Imma pick the stone!
Misfortune: This is the rock daddy threw at me once
Everyone disliked that

Edit: wowzerz guys thanks for 300 likes!
Edit 2: geepers 900?!?
Milo Murphy but parents are neglectful
OMG I was just watching some other vids and then I go watch jacksepticeye WITH HEADPHONES ON and now my ears are bleeding lol
Misfortune: Glitter. I love glitter.
Jack: I hate glitter
Misfortune: :(
The coloring book might come in handy when we face the demons of this world like the devil or Kim Kardashian
SHE. IS. ADORABLE. 
And this is already so sad. I love it.
Misfortune: My daddy threw it (stoney) at me
Me: Y I K E S   F O R E V E R - -
My heart is actually hurting for this kid
Incredible amount of references lmaoo
Why Misfortune draw so good though?????
Literally no one:

Not even Mr.Voice:

Not a single soul:

Not even the Grim Reaper:

Misfortune: Benjamin steals my uwus guys
the soundtrack at the end reminds me of sally face oh god
0:05
EVERYTHING that looks nice and My-Little-Pony-ish is NEVER good....
DID I HEAR 99 LUFT BALLONS BY NENA??
OMGGG!!!! I was waiting for this
"This is like my little pony but... sad..."

Jacksepticeye 2019
9 9     R E D     B A L L O O N S     ?
Misfortune : a fox criminal? That‚Äôs silly
Swiper : b r u h
MatPat needs to make a theory about the connections between these two games it would be awesome
does anyone play League of Legends? no more needed to say
"You shouldn't trust a fox, they're all criminals."
Come on, Mr. Voice, it's 2019.
Are megan mccarthy is the voice of her? it sound like her lol
22:43
Narrator: Da rules
Misfortune: Ok ok, consequences
F U R R Y







nothing wrong with it but u know
I LOVE THE LITTLE GIRL‚ÄôS VOICE ITS ADORABLE AS HECK
misfortune: this is the rock daddy threw at me
me: yikes forever
STONY 

S H IP
YES I have been waiting for this!!!!
For a second there I kept hearing Jester Lavore‚Äôs accent coming from Misfortune xD Critical Role is messing with my mind
Wait, foxes.... Did you say foxes? Foxes? FOXEEEEEEEES!!! FOXEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!! (The CHOCOLAAAAAAAAATE Meme from spongebob)
Misfortune throws glitter


no one:


Me: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so cute! I can't wait for the full game!!
sniffs the air hmmmm, I smell another multi-part series in your future Sean! üòÇüëç
Jack:  remember your gonna die today
Me:  Naw. I got my kettle corn. I live forever.
Jack: I'm not gonna read in that voice forever...
The Game: Yikes, forever.

Me: ..... That was fricken creepy.
12:23 flashback to when Jungkook had confetti in his pocket and threw it on Jin while the rest of BTS was cracking up
honestly guys,,,,,, the glitter is a placebo
change my mind
the misfortion of the name misfortion
Teacher: "Next Thursday we will have a test"
Rest of class: groan
Me: "Yikes forever"
Actually Jack, Little Misfortune already copyrighted " Yikes Forever! " soooooo, do you wanna get copyright from a LITTLE GIRL?






this is a joke.
Misfortune has a strange voice
"Just in case we face the evil in the world like the devil,or Kim Kardashian "üòÇ
Hey the creepy ass tree heads are back!! üòÅ Man, I loved those dudes!
The "hanging skulls" are Luciferns and yes they are also in fran bow
The hanging skulls  wear the skulls type faces that had hair and got stuck in the tree and you had to brush em out
shes a the cutest but the most relatable lil bean forever ü§ßüíû
Jack: colouring book might be handy when we face the demons of the world...




also Jack: like the devil or kim kardashian
I think eternal happiness ment heaven cause shes gonna die and stuff
That was supposed to be nicer than it sounded
Stony, Stony
Me: Tony?
Me 5 seconds later: cries loudly
Misfortune is adorable!
anyone else want a Fran Bow chapter 2 right nooooow?
when you gonna upload a new fran bow video??
Jack: i hate glitter me:me to jack
"Like the devil, or Kim Kardashian."




DeadüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
is it just me or does she sound like a polish person speaking english
black cat

Me: mR. midnight!!!!!
I love this demo 10/10
Her name is Misfortune.
HAHAHAHHA! THATS AN UNWANTED CHILD RIGHT THERE!
She is an unwanted child.
...
11:47
Jacksepticeye: You're adorable 

Me: A shame she's gonna die, huh.
I completly forgot about Fran Bow, it used to be one of my favourite games years ago. Nice to see the devs making a new game
GLITTER IS A DEARH TRAP!!
The reason things were dying and blowing up is cause she‚Äôs misfortunate
But seriously misfortune in like ‚ÄúIN LOVE‚Äù with this fox
I don't like this, I really don't like this~


Bad feelings are coming~
Imagine her father THROWING a rock at her face then she says,

"YIKES FOREVER"
What the hell did I tell all yall this is so much like fran bow I new I was right 
Ps srry got a little to excited
Ah- is this a Kikuo song?
S W I P E R  N O  S W I P I N G
"i saw a monster once.... i gave it the finger and it never came back " 

me:wish I could do that (*^*)
When Misfortune presses F, everything becomes sparkly
she sounds like wolfy chu  with the voice X3 like if u agree
Those things that where hanging in the tree at the start are also in Fran bow!the same with the pinecone!!!üòØü§óüôÇ
Oh wow, I'm looking forward to the full game now
Is it just be me who thinks she sounds like a Gru from despicable me but with a slight cold
I‚Äôm a few minutes in but I have a conspiracy theory. I‚Äôm assuming the voice doesn‚Äôt like the fox because the fox protects her. Like in the cat in coraline, except the fox tries messing the voices plan up.
she sounds like Gru's daughter...
That little song in the beginning 

(Laughs)
Wow, I cant wait for the full game. This is wonderful. I could listen to these voices all day
Jack: I think i saw hanging skulls somewhere is Fran Bow

Me: oH ReALlY
Anyone else just have that feeling that the narrator is Benjamin?
cause at the end of the demo it shows Benjamin looking at the TV 
and at the start, we see he is following a task of some sort..
1:00 1:05
he accepts the task or favor of this grim reaper figure.
and grim reapers are normally associated with death, meaning theres a chance "Mr. Voice" is Benjamin, as they seem to have the same task, kill Misfortune.
1:22 look, it's the Luciferns and a Pinezeelous tribe-person
I was so dissapointed I didn't find this earlier! I always loved Fran Bow, so I bet the full game will be just as amazing!
Little Misfortunes voice sounds a little like Venus Angelics voice
"I hate glitter its the worst abomination humanity has ever made"
-Sean W. Macloughlin 2019
"i choose the stone daddy threw at me once"
Jack: *oh shit* *mildly concerned*
"i choose the stone daddy threw at me once"
Jack: *oh shit* *mildly concerned*
Oh my god I clicked so fast when I saw thisüòÇ
your name is officially, Fantastic Fox Father Of A Family Of Fine Foxes. Fox Father for short.
Narrator: You can trust me

Mum enters

Narrator: SHE DID IT!!!!
I see m8te your growin an OIRISH beard
Awesome it‚Äôs about me!
Misfortune reminds me of a young Betty boop
This is actually the most beautiful, adorable and precious thing I have ever seen in my whole life üò≠üíï
I don't want something bad to happen to heeer!
Jack and his family of foxes is my new favourite thing
THIS LOOKS SO COOL. Please play when it's out <3
"The coloring book might come in handy when we have to face the demons of the world, like the devil or Kim Kardashian."

I m s c r e a m i n g
Damn this game pulls ALL the heart strings.
In his first episode of the Stanley Parable he called the voice Mr. Voice
Santa can't give homeless people water and food bc they don't have chimneys...
Duh
Like the devil or ‚ÄúKim Kardashian‚Äù wow
#1:02 that girl stuck the tree is that from franbow?
Jack: is that her little butt 
Me: how old is she ?
Me: looking it up
Me: JACK NOOOOOO
This is so cool! I can't wait for this! 

(Jack, those skull things are the luciferns from Fran Bow, so you have seen them before)
I haven't watched you in a long time you grow a beard I'm proud
game: nice inviting screen 
Jack: DOUBT
If you like a good narration voice, see David Attenborough.. I NEED HIM TO READ ME A BED TIME STORY... HIS VOICE
I CAN ALREADY HEAR THE WAVES OF FUTURE FANART COMING OUR WAY
sees cute art style it kind of looks like Fran bow
sees death and skulls THERES fran bow
Her accent is Norwegian! D'awww
"The colouring book might come in handy when we dace the demons in the world... like... like the devil... or Kim Kardashian."

PFt- Oh, okay XD
Why does Mr. Voice sound like F√ºrher Bradley from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (dub version)?
I was so excited to see this took place in the same universe
Misfortune: I broke a glass on accident because I was running.

Game: shift to run

Jack: runs and breaks glass 

Me: when will you ever learn that your actions have consequences?!!
the calendar has my birthday ü§™
Misfortune is gonna dieeeee!!!! Maybe not I don't know üëºüëºüëºüëºüëºüëº
Misfortune drew herself with eyebrows James Charles could not compete
I'm excited for this, the developers of one of my favourite games!
Can't wait for this game, I'm way too attached to misfortune and I miss Fran bow
Misfortune sounds Russian (I've had a Russian friend) idk why.
I left for literally a few months and came back to his channel to see him with a beard and a mustache...
I don't know what or how to feel...
>gets offered eternal happiness
>decides it would be a good gift for mother and not herself
S A I N T
This demo was fantastic!! I‚Äôm looking forward to more of the game. I enjoyed Fran Bow so i think i‚Äôm gonna enjoy this too.
1. Jack: Well need it for when we have to face the demons of he world. Like the devil, or Kim Kardashian
Me: chokes on boba tea wait no why is that funny?

2. She should change it's name to Stony Tark.
Narrator: This is Misfortune


Me: how about we just make that Miss Fortune
Jack is just looking so sexy
I'm guessing misfortune is french, because of the beret on her head and her accent
please do not be offended. I BEG
omg Sean looks so different from when i last saw him XD ^-^
Omg... I just realized. Her name is Misfortune because she is literally a "misfortune" in her mommy's life. Damn...
I feel like the fox is going to kill her
Hanging skulls?

Weren't those the silk-fly creatures that get stuck on trees together and use combs to untie themselves
8:26 
I don't remember what the anime is called but... 

Whispers "I see dead people"
this game looks sooo good!!
So if a kid wrote everythin in that diary......
That kid has better handwriting than me :| :v
The tree in the beginning was from Fran Bow Sean! I'm SOOOOO glad you noticed!!!!!
Misfortune : I chose the stone daddy threw at me once

Narrator: You will be given Choices on your journey- 

Misfortune:  okay choices 

Narrator: .....am I a Joke to you?
‚Ä¢w‚Ä¢ jack ish rocking dat beard!
This was so good! I can't wait for the full game to come out!!!
okay can we just appreciate how amazing/ intense the vibes are when you have to choose?? like everything slows down and you have to come up with a decision that may drastically change the flow of the game üëÄ
Really weird.


What I gather from the cutscene at the end, is that the gameplay revolves around puzzles that require one to redirect misfortune.


Misfortune finds little Miss Fortune, and little Miss Fortune only finds misfortune.  There is the suggestion there is a demonic force at work.  The gameplay revolves around figuring out how to redirect the misfortune with the glitter mechanic, even though they didn't seem to have that demonstrable in the demo aside from being able to glitter the soup.


I do suspect, if septiceye had opened the fridge again, and tried gliterring the bunnies, it would have actually worked, and created a scene with the fox outside.  Glittering the raven didn't work, because she believed it was just sleeping.


A clearly dead bird.  This is actually pretty sinister, when not 30 seconds earlier, she explained her Dad 'sleeps' in the car.  So is her Dad actually drunk and asleep in the car...or is he 'asleep' like the Raven?  I suspect the later, as the two uses of 'sleep' are used so closely to each other, that they must have an intended retroactive ironic context to understand what Miss Fortune believes 'sleeping' is.
No one ever:

Everyone starting May 6 2019: YIKES FOREVER
omg i loveeee heeeerr :,3
S√®an do you know what Redrum is???
I really want him to play YIIK and see his reactions.
Misfortune has the same voice as my grandma my grandma travels alot I love her voice
Uh oh. Ten minutes in and I'm waaaaay too attached to Misfortune. 15/10 too cute.




Edit: Holy likes Batman! Thanks all :)
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it our little secr-HEY BENJAMIN OUTSIDE THE WINDOW!!!!‚Äù




Jacksepticeye-2019
I have a semi theory that Misfortune is actually called Misfortune because she brings bad luck everywhere, she even brings bad luck to herself

for example, in the ending scene, she walked in the forest and all the birds died in her sight, a little cloud appeared over her head and rained onto to her, then that same cloud went to that one barn and burned it down, then that (i suppose?) satelite fell next to her, alnost hitting her, and since it was broken she sparkled glitter on it to fix it, but instead made it even worse and it got set on fire

maybe thats why she was named Misfortune? she brings bad luck to everything and everyone (could be why her mother wanted an abortion but idk about that)

maybe, because she brings bad luck to everyone and everything around her, thats why the narrator and possibly other people want her dead...?
little misfortune: what? a fox a criminal?

me: sWipEr nO sWipiNg
7:03 me and my friends were literally spamming those in the group chat because someone was feeling lonely.
this is so random but i was shook when jack started singing 99 luftballons at the start of the video sjjsksk
MisFortune's voice makes me think of how venus angelic used to talk before
Misfortune: Imma bring the stone daddy threw at me
Jack:
Jack: (oh my god no, my poor baby)
MORE...ok-ok il be nice like her PLEAAAAAASE
Omg, it's like Fran Bow meets Stanley Parable. I love it!
Her glitter causes misfortune and that heads and pinecone from the beginning are from Fran Bow
Da beard made me confused all the time OwO
Stoney gave me kidney stones...
I want to make a game like Fran Bow. And this. :3 and I don't like sushi 3:
I want to be a child again, travel faraway through my imagination when im sad and live there foreverüçÅüçÇüçÅüçÇ
Does anyone know the voice behind Little Misfortune?
Fran Bow is my favorite! üòçüòç I am happy, that they made a new game. And its in the Fran Bow Univerum! I hope I see a little bit of Itward. He is the best character üòç
me at the beginning: are those luciferns i see?
Jack: It looks cute and sparkly and my little pony like...

Me: You trust it?

Jack: I don't trust it.
Misfortune sounds like baby Sombra lol

She has the same accent as gru
2 fox related videos in one day
so far...
Misfortune: this is my diary, nobody allowed to read it

Sudden ad;  BREAK THROUGH YOUR ALLERGIES

Me; ahh- 
People; ??????
Me; 

This is what happened in my school.. Only now thought to say this..
Fran bow is one of my favourite games. The heads were the fireflies. You have to brush their hair to get untangled from the trees. :) I can't wait to see the full game!!
jack can you play the game when it really comes out
Fran bow was so good I clicked so fast when I've seen the title
Did somebody realize the "Hanging Skulls" were the flying curious witches.
THIS ACTION WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES ü¶ã
1:31 
sees hanging skulls me thinks these look familiar
This little girl legit looks like esther from the movie orphan
Jack: "Like the devil, or Kim Kardashian"
Me: "Is there a differance?"
woah you actually did your INTRO
i reacently binge watched your fran bow
The Easter egg in the beginning üëåüèªüëåüèª
That was probably the biggest rollercoaster of a demo i've ever seen... I both felt uncomfortable and in love with it ;p
I don't trust the narrator ok, if this is a game of choices I feel like he's going to try to lead us in the wrong way
Please play more of this
FROM THE FIRST SECOND I KNEW THIS WAS IN THE SAME UNIVERSE AS FRAN BOW, LIKE< THERE WAS A PINE CONE PERSON AND THE HAIR MOTHS AND OMG IM HYPED AFTER NOT EVEN A FEW MINUTES
She brings misfortune wherever she goes!
She legit sounds like dexter. üòÇ
Her name could be Misfortune....




Or it could be Miss Fortune.
The calender date in the game is my actual birthday, Yay!!
10:33 Anyone reminded of Junkrat from Overwatch?
Misfortune is a precious bean who needs to be protected at all times
Jack, your voice is amazing; never change it
Sees Misfortune:
Awwwww such a sweet innocent girl.........
Misfortune: "I showed it the finger and it never came back"
Me: ........Ok, maybe not completely innocent
wait, is the voice of misfortune VenusAngelic ?????
The art style sorta reminds me of super meat boy
My heart-
The tree from the beginning is from fran bow
She has great handwriting



Literally it's better than mine.
I want more of this game it‚Äôs so cute and interesting
The heads are called luciferns!they are dangerous when in the 5th deminsion, then there on fire.
Jack: is my glitter going to save things 
2 seconds later 
Misfortune : puts glitter on stuff
Stuff:burns
Me yeah Jack it's evil
Sentient Pinecones, Luciferns, creepy children‚Äôs drawings, portals to hell. Ladies and gents, Fran bow 2
She looks like the girl from Orphan. She sounds like the girl from Orphan. She said ‚ÄúI made myself pretty but he (dad) doesn‚Äôt care‚Äù like in Orphan.

What‚Äôs going on here???
The beginning with "99 Luftballons" killed me as a german xD
the narrator sounds like the guy that chats with cats on the streets
I want to see more, please!
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very Fran bow style but the style is really weird ‚Äú
Jack-2019
October the 11th: My birthday
I left for a month and he has a beard! Dang... It looks nice though
The pine cone is also from franbow
Why does Misfortune sound so much like Chibitalia
lil misfortune: I wanna be  juice drinker
me: No you don't
Fran Bow + Night in the Woods + Stanley Parable = this
Please make more vids of this game jacksepticeye
Please play this when it's out! I adore it!
1:03 
Are we going to ignore the fran bow reference
Is it just me but she sounds with a tinge bit of marzia
Fran Bow is literally the game where I first met Jacksepticeye, are there no one else?
1:37 I spotted 2 references to FranBow! Those weird string hair heads on the tree and the little walking pine cone dude!
My teacher is allergic to sushi :((
Omg i miss fran bow its like scary,sad,its just amaizing
Vsauce: I have decided that I want to die.


Narrator: Die? No! No one said anything about dying!!
Hearing "Fran Bow" and seeing the references made me tear up.
Like the devil.

Or Kim kardashian
i get sally face vibes on the credits scene
Like the devil or Kim Kardashian
7:42 As a kid from a pretty aweful household I can say that when I was still a child, I thought it was normal for kids to get hit by their parents and was pretty confused about what in the world that 'love' they always talked about actually was, because my parents didn't shom me and my brother any and neither did they show it to each other.
The most confusing experience in my entire life was when I got invited to eat lunch at a friends house and her dad was home. I couln't even begin to grasp why they all were so nice to each other... I grew up with my dad only being home to eat with us at weekends and we never talked at the table... looking back, there was always that aura of discomfort when my dad was around.
I just never noticed it as a kid. 

I was 9 when I was told that your dad isn't supposed to hit you hard enough to knock your theeth out... or hit you at all for that matter. I stopped having any contact with him only about 5-6 months ago from when this is written.


And if you're wondering why I share my experiences, I just want people in similar situations to know that there are others and that they don't need to be scared of sharing it.
The hardest part of getting out of stuff like this is being abled to tell someone.
I already feel like I'm going to love this game.
Jesus christ
she 
is
too
omg so excited
WHY NOT THE UNICORN, YOU FOOL!
Misfortune: i like foxes and glitter :P
Mr Voice: i hat foxes
Jack: i hate glitter
me: this is the first time i ever hated the both of u for two seconds. 

(i still love jack dont worry and i have a theory mr voice is itward, so i instantly started to like him as a character)
It's coming out this year
I love Killmonday Games!
99 Luftballons auf ihren Weg zum Horizont... üòÇ
I came to visit after the pole dancing video...

When did he become homeless?

Each like is money toward a new house
üëá
Misfortune sounds like she just inhaled an entire tank of helium. lol
Dora really did change a lot
There are so many fran bow references, I love it!
That's just hilarious, haha
Glitter... The source of CRAFTERPES
I totally i get now but its just a theory
Misfortune causes misfortune and the game wants her dead
I haven't watched Jack in like a year and I come to him with a pretty full beard!
i feel like i accomplished something just by playing the game before
‚ÄúOH NO, PENTAGRAMS, DEMONS!‚Äù
This game is quirky AF. XD
Jack: ....not as silly as throwing glitter on everything..
Me IRL: puts a sticker on my nose and throws glitter all over my room ...what?..


Edit: OMG HOW DID I GET 200 LIKES?!!!!
Another Edit like 2 days later: WTF! HOW DID I GET 300 LIKES?
Edit..again : wait people like my comment??!
i love this game already
i like how jack was singing 99 luft ballons at the beginning dghjak
plot twist: Mr voice is the monster...i think
Have you given names to the foxes in your yard?
I read fran bow in the title and came as quick as I could
Holy- I haven't been on his channel for only a couple months and it took me by surprise by how much he's changed DaNg
I was so happy when i saw this notification
Best intro ever
My name is Erica.

Oh shoot
I love 2D horror games. I really liked Fran Bow series and i'm looking forward to watch the full gameplay because this game seems really interesting
Sean's narrator voice could make me come (home) hheeheheh
Like if you agree
What if the tombstone that created the portal was actually the grave of Fran Bow? Because she was able to to see and go into the other realities, so her energy could be preserved in some other relic like thing. So instead of needing to take the ‚Äúhappy pills‚Äù, you can just use her tomb as a type of reality portals?ü§î
I missed watching Jack! Glad to be watching again.
I haven't been watching Jack for a while and at the start of the vid i literally thought he had a buzzz cut but grown out a bit
damn I should watch more of his vids
I absolutely LOVED Fran Bow! I'm so excited for this!
I love foxes so much I want to have one as a pet but wildlife animals are illegal to have as pets where I'm from so my friend told me i should go to Arizona. I have literally no problem with that cause I'll get both a pet fox and to see my friend.
THIS GAME LOOKS SO COOL IM SO PUMPED!!!!!
screaming NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS
Game: ‚ÄúStoney the stone‚Äù
Me: le gasp FLOWEY?!?
I thought this was a sequel to Fran bow and that she's what Fran reincarnated to. Maybe they are long lost sisters or connected with each other spiritually or that they could he the same person but somehow ended up being 'split into two'. Those are just my predictions.
99 RED BALLOONS GO BYYYYYYYYYY
I like the game so far, the art and how it give me the fran bow vibes; however i can't stand the voice of misfortune it's comes out as an adult how try to be owo, uwu .. where i can't help but to feel cringe worthy
Awwwwww if I was in her world I would be first one to adopt her
Did...
Did...
Did jack just hit us with a 99 luftballon reference
AHHH WHY DID I NOT FUGGIN KNOW ABOUT THIS?! FRAN BOW IS MY FAVORITE POINT AND CLICK GAME OMGG

Jack can you see me though the screen?
Jack: ' I hate glitter. It's the worst abomination humanity ever made. '
Me: You must have amnesia. There's no other way you would be able to forget that Jake Paul exists.

in the middle of the road 
Msfortune: I saw a monster!
Warrior cat fans will understand
I think missfortune his dad is drunk
This somewhat reminds me of Sally Face.
Misfortune sounds like VenusAngelic
1:34 Somebody tell me they remembered this tree. In Fran Bow. Come on, I haven't even played the game, how come I remember it and not you Jack?!
She said she might have feelings for a fox .....
That's a misfurtune
The music in the credits was lit
When will the game come out?
I wonder if Benjamin is actually trying to save her? Maybe not. Feels like Mr. Voice does not like him interfering. Great gameplay. The demo is awesome!

Edit: XDDD me too. This is why I have the middle finger swords when I go into the basement to face demons and get milk from the basement fridge.
Your intros seem to be getting a little less intense Jack....What's goin on?
Narrator: Still get monetized?

Jack: Nah that was so last year.
YES!!!! Finally, somebody who hates glitter. That stuff is the very bane of all humanity.
I was like "where'd your hair go??" Then it zoomed in and then I was like " ohhhh "

Ok i havent seen jack in a while and 
Woah why does jack look like a lumberjack
I just realized he may be trying to save the kid by telling her to not to trust foxes
Did anyone else notice the heads from Fran Bow?
"Gregg from night in the woods sure let himself go."

I got glitter bombed last week.....
I still have glitter In my hair even though I dyed my hair.
2:32 I think that is a reference to fran bow, the drawing of the tree looks like the demon thing whose name I cant remember. Something with a R I think.
12:08 
Jenna marbled has entered the chat
As soon as I saw those weird dangling heads on tree branches, I knew this was like Fran Bow
When will the full game be out?

I'm so excited for this series!
Unsted of telling her dad or mom she does this just flips the bird
6:40 "I wish in school they'd teach us where feelings come from."


School: M I T O C H O N D R I A

Daddy hits mommy. I smack them in the face and killed them. Yaaay

 Throws sparkles
Those head things on the tree at the beginning were in Fran bow
October 11.... my birthday
awww even the narrator feels bad for her, and talks to her like nothing is wrong, he is trying to protect her (but then again, I'm only at 24:11, everything can still go south)
there are in fran bow they look like heads that got stuck in a tree and u need to find a brush to comb them to free them

Really looking forward to the whole game I loved the Fran bow series
Geez, guess Mr. Midnight wasn't in the mood D:
stony the stoner-est of stones. He's reeeaaaally stoned right now
She seems to bring a lot of misfortune...jokes aside
16:00 that's basically what my mother told me about me too (minus being upfront about the abortion part), but my mother was the abusive one, and she wasn't as bad as misfortune's dad.
I think that the whole premise of the game is that she brings...well...misfortune... everywhere she goes and masks it with the glitter.
The glitter is unlucky
1:25 YASS tree dude from Fran Bow and weird hanging heads!
Luciferns in the trees!
Oh my gosh... HE GREW A BEARD!
I knew this artstyle was familiar. I loved Fran Bow!!!
I want more of this game! Oh my gosh Jack, when the full version comes out, please play it for all to see!!
Oh, I am so very exited for this
I couldn't help but admire the way Jack looks at Misfortune and imagine how he'd look at his future daughter the same and just AAGGGG SO CUTE üò≠
Misfortune's voice is enough to sell me
YouTube: Crearors can't swear or use any profanity!

YouTube Adds: kids riding in a car they stole HOLY SH*T DUDE!
Lmaoo stony the stone

AMAZING!!!!
Jack your Irish was showing at the end of the vid when you said ‚Äú what the feck was that all about?‚Äù üòÇ
Misfortune: What?! A fox criminal? That's silly.

Isn‚Äôt Eternal Happiness Code for death?
Stony had her blood on it. My god this child is so happy but all she thinks about is getting her mommy a gift a glitter.
jack singing 99 luftballoons in the beginning has given me life
the lector seems so caring for misfortune
Since I love dark humor I found this whole video very funny.

Sushi isnt as good as i thought
DO A VLOG WITH THE FOXES
Presenting Little Misfortune.

Where you kill Things by being near them

Fran Bow was amazing
Jack needs to do voice acting

Fox: goes into round portal
Me: DR STRANGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING?!
Dr strange:  umm........
Stony is... Bloody?
this game is going to be great
Like the devil
This seems pretty epic not gonna lie
"You can't trust Foxes, they're all criminals."


"SWIPER. NO. SWIPING!!!"
Screams
I really wanna see you play the full version of this game!
I wonder if Critical Roll's Jester had any influence on this character, they're remarkably similar! :)
foxes are criminals bc they stealyour heart when they floof
Don't forget, there was a cat in Fran Bow as well! Really liked the callbacks to that game.
I love her so much already
awww. she's adorable.
I think that the choice of which toy you bring with with you is really important for the ending. Like the rock represents reality, but also  aggressiv behavior and sadness, because of the story behind it, the sad face drawn on it, the contrast with it's dark colors to the cute and lively room and that she didn't decorated it with anything like stickers. You would expect that from Misfortune/ Miss Fortune.
The Rock will probably confront Misfortune/Miss fortune  with the harsh reality and sadness in life. Forcing the child to deal with it and that could result to her harming someone with the rock like her father did. I'm guess Ing that the rock will also represent the story of her father.
The unicorn stands for fantasy and all the things she likes, but that doesn't have to mean that it's the right choice either. Later on it'll probably lead the main character to ignore important problems to instead stay in a fantasy world. It represents the mothers side of the story, because the mother ignores the problems with her husband by drinking alcohol. She stays in the abusive relationship and tries to ignore the bad things.
The rock represents Misfortunes/ Miss fortunes Father and reality and the unicorn her mother and fantasy thats why she can't take both toys.
She has to decide what kind of person she wants to be. You can see that it's an ongoing theme by the Vase that she broke. She could leave it like that and accept that it's broken or "fix" it by just piecing it  together. You could clearly see that it's still broken by all the cracks, but she ignored it and said something like "Look! I fixed it."
Did any one notice Fran bows dress in her wardrobe?
DEATH TO ALL GLITTER!
Kimberly and Steven is my parents names
she kind of sound like lilypichu
*how in the hae is this game way tooo similar to the unfinished story I made back in 5th grade...?
Ahhh this game I am going to look forward to this game!
I'm screaming. Quietly. aaaaaaaaaaaaa
She sounds like Luna from those MLP paradox videos where they lick frogs.
I have this strong feeling that Benjamin is the narrator, even as the narrator says ‚Äúugh... that f o x...‚Äù
I HAVE A THEORY!

There is a reason why she is called 'Little Misfortune'!


Everywhere she goes, something bad happens!
She was born, her mother started to drink and her family started fighting.
Every time she runs, she breaks something in the house(Because let's be honest, even though that lump in the carpet was there, it was so visible she could've avoided it but it was because she was so clumsy and clumsy often leads to misfortune, am I right?)
When the bird died, she saw something yes, but when the vision came up that was the bird she was closest to so it died along with the vision.
Then at the end demo credits, when she was walking past all of the trees, all of the birds were dying!
Then when the rain cloud came it only went over her and then burnt the house to a crisp.
Not only that, when she walked where the Satellite fell, that means she walked under the Satellite meaning that if it's far up she can still cause something bad to it though it doesn't count in a radius beside her, only up from her. Then the Satellite caught on fire because of her 'happiness glitter'.
oh and um jack those "sculls" are from franbow you brush their hair and the turn into butterflies and that pine cone is from franbow too  just so you know :)
When‚Äôs this game out?
Can't wait for the full release!
Remember, it‚Äôs not a furry if they‚Äôre young but it‚Äôs messed up if the animal is an adult. Kinda adds to the story a bit.
James Charles is sitting on your lap right now 


Like to push him off
IM SUCH A LADY
I wounder how its going to end
0:00 i Love that song
The hanging skulls are called Luciferns in Fran bow.
That's why they look similar.

Edit: yes I liked my own comment your point.
"(dark) Our little secret...(happy) Hey! Benjamin's outside the window!"
I AM
SO
HAPPY
The decision choices style is the same as life is strange
She is so cute
This is so heart warming but also dark and sad pls play more and promise to keep yikes forever as your catch phrase
October 11 is my birthday huh lol..
Based on the end of the demo, it seems she causes "Misfortune" all around her kinda like Milo Murphy. This game is going to have a big twist, I'm excited for the full game to come out.
Why isn't is Little Ms.FortuneüôÅ
OMG I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME!
4:44 anyone else all of a sudden really want a family of foxes in their yard?




(edit) thx for the likes i never get any :')
oof this game was too real for me
ABSOLUTELY YES
Misfortune sounds like a little old Russian grandma
this is cool and all but can you do Sally Face part 5 when it comes out? please Jack?
I recently just rewatched the Fran bow series and the hair skull bois are the firefly bois and the pine cone bois are both from Fran bow
WHOA jack you got a bear I mean I knew I was gone for a while but how and why
man, i know how this kid feels.
Jack: I'm not going to read all that

Reads all of it
Omfg  12:44 where she said ‚Äòi showed him the finger and he never came back‚Äô IM IN TEARS üòÇ
Firstly: why does Misfortune sound like Pewdiepie's impression of Marzia? 

Secondly: Fran Bow is one of my favorite games and let's plays you've done on your channel-I'm excited to see what happens with this project! I definitely think it looks promising, and I love the shared universe with Fran Bow. I hope to see you play the finished game in the future. üñ§üåπ
Pan's labyrinth: The game
She sounds like Dexter from Dexter's laboratory lmao
0:07 in and I'm laughing üòÇ
She sounds like jimmy Fallon when he does ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù voices for characters or imitates someone lol.
Jack: The colouring book might come in handy when we face the demons of the world, like the Devil or Kim Kardashian.

Yes, those two are practically interchangeable.
Can we all acknowledge the fact that the Narrator probably is either death who will take Misfortune's soul, or a demon that will kill her?
Now im sooo intrest in this game ivr never heard abouy it but i cant wait now
broke 4th wall out the bat
The narrator is a demon, im calling it here and now and she just made a deal by stepping on the pentagram. It‚Äôs a crossroads demon
"Is it okay to have feelings for a fox?" well you'd be made fun of as a furry but sure

also,is it too early to say I wanna protect her with my life?
Why is everyone acting like Fantastic Mr Fox isn‚Äôt a criminal
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLAY THIS GAME
she sounds like gru
I love this game! Please play it till the end
Her accent and personality is very Jester Lavorre 


I'm a fan
I think the Grim riper send Benjamin to kill misfurtune in the beginig you can see him. They where in the 5 dimension that is dangerous if fran bow was right. The heads is from that dimension. Or benjamin is trying to save her i think Numbers 1. 

Only me? 
I mean mr.voice is trying to save her or eternal happynes is you know a dead misfurtune. 

Who knows!
Ok am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt trust Benjamin? There is WAY too much foreshadowing that he is a bad guy!
SHES SO CUTE DNSJHDSKSN
we need more like if you want more
I WAS LITERALLY JUST REWATCHING THE FRAN BOW PLAYTHROUGH WHEN THIS GOT UPLOADED!
16:01 So does this take place in Alabama?
Misfortune reveals that she had a furry fetish-
I mean her name is MISFORTUNE...actually that makes it more sad
Maybe her parents called her misfortune because she was a misfortune for the dad and mom
He reminds me of my band director with that hair
Please play the full game please, I've been waiting days for you to play it
Thanks for the likes guys!
I'm so excited for this game
This is the story of Misfortune. She's either gonna die a child or live long enough to become a serial killer...
Misfortune is so kawaii .
Moms don‚Äôt sads NO more
Misfortune sounds a bit like Marzia dont argue with me on this
Damn didn't know she lived in Alabama
furries at young ages..
That child looks like Eclipsa from svtfoe lol
20:37 That‚Äôs my birthday - October 11th!
Yay! More Jacksepticeye!üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüëçü•∞
Ok wow I love her
Really cant wait for this gave
That accent us so adorable
Her voice reminds me of Mei XD
Why did the first few mins remind me of Adventure time? lol (man I miss that show üò≠üò≠)
Waiting for Sally face;(
Eternal happiness is death to put her out of her misfortune (no pun intended)
Hakuna tomatas!!! lol I just had to.
Fran Bow was the best experience I've had watching a series a youtube
it said oct 11 on the calendar in the game so that means this all takes place on my birthday oof
You may be right about how your parents in print you, I don't live with  my real parents so I live with my great grandparents and we argue a lot...and that kinda impacts my social skills, so now I have a bad temper and usually argue with people....
Y E S FINALLY
WHAT HAPPEND TO YOUR HAIR!!!! XD
Aww, she's precious, but she gonna diiiieeeee. 


Loved Fran Bow so much, loving this already!!
ITS OUR LITTLE RUSSIAN LADY
I think the narrator it's like the Grim Reaper, leading Misfortune to her death and the fox is going to save her.
The eternal happiness that is promised is actually heaven because she is going to die. That‚Äôs my theory, at least.
Oh my god! Yaas, this is a must have playthrough!!
I guess you could could say Little Misfortune was a happy little accident
who else thought the black cat was mr midnight
U should feed the foxes
i bet the mom is going to be fran bow
Mmmmmmmm........ SHES TO PRECIOUS WE MUST PROTECT THIS GIRL
Reads the title, noticing the name " Fran Bow "

Nani?!
For a second, after I saw the title, I thought that this was a demo for a sequel to Fran Bow.
69k likes. Nice
her nme is misfortune not miss fortune
This game is so creepy and cute! I love it so much I can't wait till the game is fully released!
Now I have to rewatch the fran bow series to quench my first for more of that modern take on alice in wonderland.
15:38 am I the only one to notice she said damn it
did i hit good likes
Nah i believe Morgam Freeman's voice is better
I think that since her name is Misfortune that bad things happen because of her because when she was in the forest at the end all the birds died along with that satellite
This game looks awesome. I have no idea what the hell is happening in it. All i know is: Glitter, Demons and Eternal Happiness. Its like My Little Pony for sadists
Bro did anyone notice that the pinecones and the heads, in the beginning, are from Fran Bow!?!?!
u have to play the whole thing when it comes out!!!!!
Yes ETERNAL happiness....... its Doom Eternal if u dont get it
wouldn't it be weird if  Death was actually the narrator.
Greg from night in the woods is a dog... That thing is a fox
I think she's named Misfortune because unfortunate things don't happen TO her... They happen BECAUSE of her!
My name is Benjamin too
Ow  my  spirit  is  a fox
I want to protect Misfortune with all of my heart and soul. she‚Äôs so precious and pure
20:35 that voice crack though.
awe you got basically pet foxes
Doesn't Misfortune sound like Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory?????!
She sounds like Gru
your fran bow series is one of my favorite ever and i'm glad the devs are making another game
pleASEE PLAY MORE!
I wanna say miss fortune instead of misfortune üòÖ
Awesome game! I hope you do a playthrough
Omg, the date in the game is my birthday! ...Wait... ‚Äúshe will die today‚Äù ..... üò∞
Did you see all the fran bow references? This is super cool!

Jack, great job as always, you should make this a full time thing!
1:32 did anyone else see the heads hanging. The heads are from Fran bow
HAPPINESS FOR YOU DEAD BIRD!
When a small kid draws hands better then you
imagine if misfortune is Franbow's child o0o
When are you free to do one
Little Misfortune? thinks LITTLE INFERNO!!! yells
Does this mean Fran bows adevntures actually had her traversing real planes ot wasn't just in her head?
Is there an option in the game to call on social services on that girl?? Like the game an its art, but boy its messed up beyond another level!!
Checked his Instagram and so sad! I was promised foxes! üòÇ
Edit: never mind Twitter did not disappoint!
someone give scp 999 to this lil girl NOW!!!
Right now her name is misfortune but later on her name would be Mrs. FortuneüòÑ
I‚Äôve been gone for a while, huh? Jack‚Äôs got one heck of a beard now!
Brings attention to abortion laws, gun control laws, domestic abuse, neglect, effects of this on mental health and perspective of children. 10/10
A game made by the Fran Bow devs?
"Ah shit here we go again"
18:37 yikes, forever.
Misfortune sounds like a drunken Russian on helium
Awesome  intro.
When you get glitter on your hands and you cant get it off
Me:this is the end
The black cat next to the road reminds me of Mr Midnight from Fran Bow
Oh hey the tangled up tree heads from Fran Bow are here
I wanna play this so bad! I think it might end up being even better than Fran Bow.
wooooooah wtf who else say the creepy ass floaty old lady heads with the long hair hanging from the tree those were the same ones in Fran bow
This makes me want to see Jack play Broken Age. I think he'd like it and I'd love to see his reaction.
k n e w i t
Where‚Äôs the boy Benjamin???
she laughs when she's nervous or anxious...just like me
I like only one type of sushi
Little misfortune: ‚Äúok choices‚Äù
22:54 then jack 23:24
Me:üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£
I had a similar childhood but my mom was the one who would hit people
endglitter2019
yeS YES YES YES YES YES
I want Fran and Misfortune to be friends
Your opening is exactly what it looks like when I'm trying to sing the song.
Soooo is the goal of the game to kill her and the obstacle is her constantly escaping death? Is she a harbinger of destruction to where the player must accept she has to be stopped? Or are we stopping her from getting herself killed, since she's crushing on the reaper?
1:35 those things arent "hanging skulls" if im correkt their called pigmi heads
Go outside and into the white van
Missfortune: a fox criminal that's silly


Swiper: hold my beer
Is misfortune like pandora and you know, just cause destruction where she goes?
I haven't been active on your channel for a while and I get suprised with a beard? DAmmmM
i looked at the comments to see if anything scary happens the comments were no help
Misfortune is a hardcore
looking at the picture of Benjamin, Misfortune has amazing hand writing
Am I the only one that saw the heads hanging from the trees and the pinecone from Fran bow????
Do you know roughly when it's going to come out?
Jack= I hate glitter it's the worst abomanation humans have ever made

Me= SAME!!!!!
2 seconds in and I‚Äôm greeted by jack flying in by balloon why am I surprised?
oh lordy....
the date on the calendar at 20:32 is my birthday......






DID THIS PRECIOUS THING DIE ON MY BIRTHDAY?!
She sounds like she has Wolfychus voice
At 8:07 jack is trying to explain primary socialisation, everything from our culture which we learn from our parents. We mimic when children until about the age of twelve where we go into secondary socialisation: learning the culture from our peers, school, the mass media etc. Secondary socialisation never ends and we are constantly learning and mimicking. 

(Had to edit the time)
This looks awesome...
21:28 well, f you too narrator
The devs behind fran Bow make some amazing games!! I would love this to become a massive hit in the gaming industry
I need more
Jack they were the tangled heads from Fran bow, Remember you had to comb their hair to set them free
PLEASE JACK PLAY THE REAL GAME PLEASE
There was three crows on the road. Wich means health, but on the title screen there were six, wich means illness...
Record full game when it's out. Your choices are interesting.
When she said "I never get to pet the sweet animals" I swore she said "I never get to pet or shoot animals"
1:33 the hair skull ghost thingys
Stony the Stoner.
Giving me some real Sally face vibe
Maybe the cat was Mr midnight uuh gasp
HE FORGOT REAFY FROM SUBNAUTICA
This game makes me feel useless. She's innocent and doesn't have much social skills
How did jack not recognize the hair people on the tree and the pin one at the beginning
5:53 can‚Äôt stop laughing
Currently @ 5:57, literally crying just because of how precious she is. They better not hurt her.
EDIT- I‚Äôm at the end of the video. I love her. If anything happens to her, I‚Äôm killing everyone, and then myself.
The little girl is from Russia..That's how they talk in Russia..She is adorable!!!
Wow that's saaaad
6:30 ive never read a more relatable sentence than that. I have no clue about some of my emotions for people or my family, everything is confusing. poor sweet thing :( i understand.
In the beginning the first thing I thought was it‚Äôs a game to help people come out as a furry
I can't wait for the full game I'm so pumped ^_^
I need more
Quite real. How exiting for the future
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
inserts yikes forever
I literally (and im not kidding) 





Went to Jacks instagram and looked for a picture of the fox family. And couldnt find any. 
1:30 jack didn‚Äôt realize the head form Fran bow was there
Jack: "Was that her little butt?"
Stony got stoned
A fox led adventure sanctioned by death himself whit Jack playing none the less. !!!  NEAT!!
Hey Jack, you think you could do a Oneshot playthrough? Came out a few years ago, but it's a super good game!
its the hair tree!!! and can I have your house please?
I'm extremely glad I didn't watch this while I was depressed. little misfortune is like a fricking mirror image of what I was dealing with. No one taught me what to feel
She sounds like VenusAngelic
"I hate glitter"
Me: le gasp I love glitter
as a weapon
It never goes away shutters
That's a pretty cool fox
Hi, when will this game be released
"gregg from night in the woods sure let himself go" I CACKLED
NIGHT IN DA WOOOOOODS!!!!!!!
Ah yes, the adventures of Stony the Stone and his friend, Flowey the Flower. :P
The finger is great  Bigfoot repellent lmao
AAAAA
Jack sally face episode 5 for sally face is rumoured to be out 25th of may
Seeing how perfectly innocent she is for how bad her family is, makes me want to punch her parents...yes punch, I‚Äôm not taking that back!
I was thinking that fox reminded me of night in the woods

And then jack was like
‚ÄúOh GrEG frOm niGht in the WOods‚Äù


You read my mind
Misfortune sounds like a female little Gru
I think I see Fran Bow's outfit in her closet at the begining
yeah the voice is kinda weird.
NEUN UND NEUNZIG LUFTBALLONGS
You underestimate the power of the cheerleaders jack. They increase attack speed so when you put a bunch of them with ranged units, like the hwacha, they fire and reload ridiculously fast, especially with the catapult, ballista and hwacha and you'll see the magic. You can also do this with a mace spinner and it becomes a literal tornado.
Like so Sean can see this.
"The cheerleaders are a dissapointment"

Oh Jack... You just mocked the cheerleader unit. They can turn mace spinners into tornados, they can make balistas rapid fire, they make attacks faster. 

Oh God, it's probably one of the best units in the game
Nobody gonna say anything about how Jack hasn't updated the description since the time when Roger's head shrank?
I voted Ice Giant




IM SO GOOD AT THIS
The evolution of Roger

5:49 THEIR FEASTING ON YOUR FLESH!!! 

Me: Of course They Are! Becouse Others Call Them Zombies!
Jack: Misses some hidden troops

Fans: We're about to ruin this man's career
I haven‚Äôt watched jack in about a year and now I really regret it.
0:05 when an anxiety attack starts coming-when it slowly leaves you 0:16
Jack: ‚ÄúLooking for the elusive...‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúCARMEN SAN DIEGO!‚Äù
Jack: ‚Äú...the strange‚Äù
Jack there are secret units in totally accurate battle simulator
Jack try 20 cheerleaders and one mace spinner!
It will create something special.

Edit: 
Mace spinner: Medieval 2 - Inside a tall tower to the right.
Executioner: Medieval 1 - There's an axe in a tree stump.
Artemis: Ancient 1 - At the top of the lighthouse.
Everyone:the best game is tabs
Arthur Morgan:Am i a joke to you?
you didnt find Artemis, executioner and mace spinner. use a bunch of cheerleaders on the mace spinner and it will be a crazy tornado
T posing to assert dominanceüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Sean you crack me up
I vote Tree Giant for the Giant battle! The power of nature compels you!
JACK! You missed the first secret units. These are all the new ones. The cheerleaders speed up attack,and when you find the Mace Spinner,team him up with a bunch of cheerleaders
you missed one where you found the tree giant and there are 2 more after that
jack where is the next vid :( im tired of waiting its been 13 days
Jack i love your vids like so he can see this pls
You should also be looking for Artemis, the Mace Spinner, and the Executioner.
Just put 1 archer and 10 cheerleaders vs 50 halflings and see the magic.
Like so Sean can see this.
If jack danced it would be called the shamrock shake
13:33 Quick, no time to explain! Turn your volume to 100! You've got to trust me!
Sean: My Money Is On The Tree Giant
 Me: I Love You My Beautiful Child, Because Irish Minds Think Alike
i love attack on titans like if you do too
Jack the Cheerleaders are AMAZING. They make units fire faster, catapults, arrows, ballistas, mace spinners. And more. Also, there are even more secret units

Edit: Bro, thanks for the likes, really hope Jack sees this
Speaking of world War z could you please play it?
the thing is, he made an error on the first upload. It was #9 when it was suppose to be #10 xD

I think you missed feckin Artemis,mace spinners and executioner
There are three other secret units:
Artemis - Ancient 1
Mace Spinner - Medieval 2
Executioner - Medieval 1
Happy Hunting!
He missed one unit

Sean: Look at this pillar of men!





Men...pillar.....
You should do a clash of the titans
Firework archers vs a mammoth
the cheerleaders pump up other units

dear god, he mixed so many memes today, deja vu AOT E/markiplier meme halo theme wth jack
There is a Artemis special unit in tabs, i don't know what map tho
MORE I WANT MORE VIDEOS
I wonder how many comments bombarded this video saying 'JACK YOU MISSED ARTEMIS' (and the executioner and the human beybla- i mean mace spinner)
1: you're still missing 3 secret units.
2: the cheerleaders increases attack speed. Try putting like ten with a WHACHA or one of the secret units you have yet to find.
3: the shogun is essentially a better teacher as he has the same abilities just better.
Jack the cheerleaders buff your unit speed and strength  look in ancient 1  for mace spinner with cheerleaders makes a tornadoes
Artemis, Executioner, and Mace Spinner
jack you missed 3 secret units macespiner,artimies,executioner

"This is you, and this is all my love and affection"
the tree man starts swinging and a blue guy grabs some booty
Jack, are you saying that if we try to escape your love and affection...that it'll come to cop a feel? Can we never escape with our butts untouched..?
Who would like 50 shades of ice giant

1) ballista with 20 cheerleaders
2) hwacha with 20 cheerleaders
3) catapult with 20 cheerleaders
4) mace spinner (secret unit) with 20 cheerleaders


you will be happy.
Hi Jacksepticeye, I was wondering if you would consider doing an LP for Persona 5 or Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc?
the tree giant looks like Steve Aoki

2:10 goddammit Robin, you never cease to impress.
There are 12 secret units you forgot artemis, the executioner and the mace spinner

The cheerleaders buff up other units attack speed and when you find the other three units use the cheerleaders on Artemis (may crash computer) and the mace spinner it's awesome üëè (also try the catapult, HWACHA and Steve Its hilarious üòÇ)

Mace Spinner, Arthimus(or somethin like that), and the Executioner
Can you continue clone drone in the danger zo;ne?
What happened to vacation simulator
12 secret units
The cheer leaders boost attack speed and the the teacher deflects enemy's attacks and is only good against 1-5 people but depends what unit they are.
Jack, the cheerleaders actually speed up the attack rate of units, so if you do something like place a giant crowd of cheerleaders near a Ballista, it will fire at a rapid rate.
at 18:03 that was an epic scene
I just started watching game of thrones nice for no spoiler warning üòîüòî
Blue is gonna win

jack you forgot the other three artemins the executioner and the one and only mace spinner there old ones but try a lot of cheerleaders and a mace spinner and something magical will happen

I GOT A PEPSI AD! THIS IS FORBIDDEN
Do shogun vs ice giant
Can we talk about how Sean couldn't seem to care less about how everything costs less than the Ice Giant?
Doing 3 Sensei vs 1 Ice Giant is 9k vs 6k, and the Sensei won. Doing 1 sensei vs 1 ice giant is 3k vs 6k and the ice giant won. 
SO WHY NOT DO 2v1???
ice giant you missed two sercet units
if you do 30 cheerleaders and a mace spinner the mace spinner will become a tornado.
Samurai giant


Dammit
stop.spoiling.game.of.thrones
Did anyone else notice how little Jack‚Äôs WWZ reference made sense 

The zombies in WWZ didn‚Äôt eat humans and weren‚Äôt dead just spreading the virus and moving on.
2:55 the captions XD
The cheerleaders make units attack faster so if you put a ballista and a couple cheerleaders, the ballista will shoot faster

Ps: there are 3 other secret units you missed
I'm rather cuious how many hwachas it would take to take down the giants
The cheer leaders increase your speed health and attack speed
Actually there are 12 total secret units.

The ice giant vs ice giant is like the all Ireland mayo vs dublin
Ice giant didn't look ahead just logical
So, you need to put the cheerleader on some of the teams with like the mace spinner and so on because it makes them 1000 times more entertaining. Not to mention the fact that a cheerleader fueled hwacha (didn't spell that right) is one of the most powerful things in the game.
there are more secret units left
Why does the man bun bother me? I know it shouldn't, but it does.
Stories untold is coming! Do we all know what that means??

Ps. When you use the cheerleader use like 30 of them
so LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

god dammit
Cut ur beard u look insane
Take 20 cheerleaders and 1 mace spinner against 100 halflings
There are 3 more units to go.

17:06 Eren(red) vs Reiner(blue) attack on titan
Ice Giant
You missed Artemis (Ancient 1 on Lighthouse, 2 Bows), Mace Spinner (Medival 2 on the big castle, Maces), and Executioner (Medival 1, Axe on a Tree Stump)
you is dum
Jack is lit
Ice giant again
This is how many people like red
‚¨áÔ∏è
Jack, actually there are 12 secret units. You missed three.
Also, the cheerleaders are OVERPOWERED when mixed with some units. They boost the attack rate of the most expensive unit on their team and just two or three of them with a hwacha can make it reload so fast it never stops firing.
Ice  giant
omg use the cheerleader with some of the other units like the scarcrow guys and the giants
The 12 ones
9:26 AYAYAYAYYYYY
Looks like giants arn't extinct after all :D

The Tree Giant looks like Jesus Christ

He uses a tree as a weapon

Adam and Eve ate apples from a tree and doomed humanity

Tree Giant is destroying the humans

God isn't in the game

Jack IS God controlling the game

The Tree Giant IS Jesus Christ

Which means...

Jesus Christ is getting vengeance for God by destroying the Humans with the greatest sin they've done to God

And also means

Jack will be added to the game as God
Notice me

Me: I KNEW HE WAS BAKUGO
Jack in 2018: "I don't like calling you guys 'fans', we are a community"
Jack in 2019: MY FANS
Yeah, you're right. I came for the strange screaming Irish man who somehow hasn't gotten complaints from neighbors

Or any 90's white guy
Jack - I'm missing a warhammer
Me - finishes video and then instantly starts researching Smithing tutorials.
4:33 I'm pretty sure all Irish have a bit of Scandinavian because of vikings.
You have elf ears in this video. Like extreme ones haha.
Jack LETS GO GET DRUNK >-<
viewers: fix your lamp
jacksepticeye years ago: LAMPY!!!!!
Jack: pls sub


Me: already did buddy, 6 years ago. Don't worry about me :')
You should call this series the most energetic media entertainment hour
Honestly coke should sponsor jack because I didn't hear about zero sugar coke with the same great coke taste with a hint of vanilla until jack mentioned it and I've been thinking of buying it because he mentions it so much
My name is Tyra and it's Scandinavian it means little battler so i suppose im a Viking ü§£

JACK'S MEME REVIEW




OR
teacher: there is 14:18 minutes of class left
me:
My mom doesn't know/watch English speaking YouTubers but she always recognizes Jack by his voice.
A meme a day ..
Keeps the sadness awayüòÅ
Nice advice üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"my favorite anime is dr. phil"
I‚Äôm unsubscribing because Jacksepticeye‚Äôs favorite anime is Dr Phil and not Cory in the House
* Is a fan of 'top tier high-quality animes' 
* Can't even pronounce the names correctly
Who new that Jack would be Luigi in another universe?
Jack and Coke is gonna be like Arin and Wendy's ü§£ü§£
Jack: I‚Äôm the evolved person here 
Me: are you sure about that
Jack watch 
The Time I was Reincarnated as a Slime
It's amazing.
In fact ..... jacksepticeye does look like athlestan from "VIKINGS" üò∂
Jack you need to watch Baki the grappler plz you will love the memes!
After hearing Sean talk about anime for five seconds i thought he was sponsored by Crunchyroll XD
MEME REVIEW üëèüëè
this fake background/real background bit is a huge attest to how unbelievably good robin is. like, DAMN!
6:38 Sean: saying he has been "selling the sh1t out of Coca cola"

MatPat the game theorist (who's litterally obsesed with it and has been talking about how great coca cola is for YEARS):
"Am I a joke to you??"
You should call this show IDAYA

'I didn‚Äôt ask you anything'
Jack it's because you ARE selling coke out for free that you aren't going to get the sponsorship.
They won't pay you to do something your doing for free.
Congrats on 22M I‚Äôve been watching you for 6 years and you always bring a smile to my face and you always make me...

LAUGH üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
parent: why do you scream and swear so much.
jack: FFFUUUUCCCKK!!
Today's fact: Like humans, plants recognize their siblings and give them preferential treatment.
jack:im just a zoo you guys love it

me: is this a petting zoo?? do they bite???
Hey jack I have a request for a game for you to play on PC
Real background saw Sean's reflection in board
Jack you should react to YouTube civil war remake
1:46 Jack/Sean: casually burns some of Mark‚Äôs and Felix‚Äôs most famous segments
Call this series ‚ÄúMake fun of Meme‚Äù
Me: so apparently jack and Luigi is the same
My sister: yeah they're both Italian

8:11 Also: why are your pants dark
At your grandma's funeral

MEME
I was watching your channel and my parents walked in and asked: who's that
Me: jacksepticye
Them: he has a very bog accent
Me: yeah because he's a bog boy.
Dad: oh yeah (talks about the things he's heard about jack)
Jack be chasing that coke sponsorship the way Arin chased Wendy's.
Ironically enough, this channel was actually part of the cure to my depression. XD
pimples? zero
blackheads? zero
jack with a coke sponsership? zero
hotel? trivago
To be honest I don't even remember why I subscribed cuz it was so long ago but im glad I did
everyone text and tweet Coca-Cola "have you heard about the jacksepticeye variety channel?"
SAM ARMY!! 
Can we see your Sam Army?
üíö
I've been watching you for two yearsüíô‚ù§üíô
I'm not much a soda drinker per se, but I REFUSE to try a single drop of ANY Coca Cola product until Jack gets the DAMN SPONSORSHIP HE DESERVES!!!!
Jack: if you did'nt chuckle what's wrong with you?
Me:ohhh!!! i know this one how about anxiety that you are going to die in about 40-50 years and i will not be able to watch your content.
Jack:......
me:......is My answer wrong?
"My favorite anime is Dr. Phil."

Call it depression destruction haha thatll be great, thanks for the LAUGHS love you Gaelic godman
I do the same thing with drinks
JACK! Once you stop talking about 
coke zero sugar, great coke taste but with zero sugar and with a hint of added vanilla,
then they will sponsor you
My hero academia, you say?

I just love my hero academia :)
Every time I read his last name I read it as McLaghingüòÇüòÇüòÇ It suits him Thoo!!
Coke: maybe we need to~

Jack: LAUGH.
I actually tried the zero sugar coke because of you, and it's FANTASTIC! Love the Meme Hour!
Jack just lowkey making me feel better about myself when he starts talking about how his lamp doesnt need to be fixed
It's like he edits his "laughs" in because it's always perfectly identical.
Jack: "I was just happy where I was." 
Fans: Well, bye!
"It's always a good time for memes!"That's an opinion I can agree with
nobody:

me: I forgot jack had elf ears
Jack is Luigi confirmed. lol
"What Do You Meme" is an actually card game.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How dare you disrespect Naruto my heart is shattered üò¢üòÇ
Sean: "What can go wrong with the human form" 
Me: Mmmmmmmmm doubts-
That gremlin in my head: So wrong it's right ayyyyyyyyyy
What if coke has already sponsored him in secret without letting anyone know so that he could turn the coke advertisement into a meme and not be called a "sellout" by haters....??
The plot thickens
Immediately had subtitles on, and I'm so glad I did.
I would like some spaghetti with Bolognese saucekay
Everyone: why does he yell so much 


Sean: I'm Irish
I was eating a banana while you said that is absolutely bananas 

I nearly choked

Thanks Jack
Overprotective Mother : Why do you yell and swear so much.
Jack : I'M F****** IRISH
This is the real Sean, he didn't the "TOP OF THE MORNING !"
8:26 - 8:35

I was having really bad dysphoria and this helped a lot... thank youüíõ
Is anyone else getting flashbacks to when Arin kept trying to get Wendies to sponsor him.
Jack's meaning of his name is so funky.

Meanwhile in the same country: 
Me: Oh. So my name is Irish as well. Pure Spear. 
Ooh Sean! My last name Osburn, which has evolved over many pronunciations of Osbourne, Osborne, etc.. Comes from the Norwegian name Asbjorn, meaning Holy Bear or Devine bear. I'm literally your Paladin and we must join forces to allow the CocaCola factions to join your tribe! 

Any thoughts? :D
2:51

Parents: Stay away from me and my family
Jack is forgetting that some people have OCD and may get mad at the one broken and one that is fine
The name of this series should be ‚ÄúCuring Your Depression‚Äù
8:30 how weebs say it: naruto

"I'm irish. Its what we do."
Actually Vikings are Nordic and had major cultural influences over places like Ancient Ireland and Scotland after taking control of those parts of the world. So technically speaking, the "son of a viking!" meme is historically accurate, just not in relation to Irish pride but more in correlation with Ancient Norse influences.

Jacksepticeye "Spud Spartan!"
Jesus, the first time I've watched jack in awhile, wtf happened

All of his fans: (SLAM!) LAUGH
My name is Nelson John Millwood Hughes, So Millwood is Anglo Saxon & Hughes is the Irish and Scottish anglicisation of Gaelic Mac Aodha or something I don‚Äôt know

Watching Jacksepticeye videos? M E M E !
Jack I will make you one
DOES ANYONE EVEN THINK ABOUT MATPAT? He wants to be sponsored by coca cola zero sugar great whatever too!
My name means the arrival of the tiger
jack lies to us. twas real backround the whole time
YAY JACKS BACK
Wow thx my grandmother is 84
Other Lamp: am i a joke to you?
well my name is Alarik and in Scotland it means i'm a viking as well.... were the same Jack!
When Jack made the noises at the beginning of the video, my dog started watching the TV and tilting her head lmao
This is Chase Brody. Fight me.
But I also hold cups like that-
Press F to pay respects for all those mistreated lamps out there.
funny enough a pepsi max vanilla ad during this video
I don't come here for the yelling, I come here for  your personality AAAANNDD the yelling!
The begining of the video represents my IQ after watching a jacksepticeye video
a warhammer has a pointy bit i think jack.
Jack: you know you subbed only to hear the screaming and swearing.

Me: I feel attacked
Hey, Sean in Irish actually mean's God's Gracious Gift. Literally Jack is God's gracious gift to us, the subscribers.
Anyone else really miss the intro and outro in this one
'Boku No Hero My Academia' means 'My Hero My Academia'
Nah B, you're the son of an overgrown potato farm.
Jack: swearing is a problem when i stop doing that.
Me:And you've only realized it now!
Meme review!!!
I freaked out when he said Boku No Hero academia
Jack you are the best!
Coke is a tease about sponsorships. It's why matpat jumped ship because they have teased him a few times with sponsorship
Thank youuuu finally my depression has finally gone to another universe
I was born in Valhalla
Everyone notice how Jack is slowly turning into his Chase persona?
Bnha noice man üëå
A lamp can be broken and still be beautiful just like humans, many may be broken but they are still beautiful
I think Chase, Anti and Jack morphed into one
How he pronounced naruto lol
Except you did that to the lamp in the first place. Poor lamp.
I SUPPORT YOU JACKA BOI I THINK THAT COKE ZERO SUGAR WITH THE SAME GREAT TASTE WITH A HINT OF VANILLA  SHOULD SPONSOR YOU FOR SURE DUDE
10:29 - 10:38






Thank me later üòÇ
Jack i can hook you up with a War hammer but i need it a place to send it
One like = one prayer for lamp r.i.p
jack is like matpat and diet coke with his Coca-Cola zero sugar with the same great taste but with zero sugar and a hint of added vanilla
3:34 Jack, if you're Irish, it's not Gaelic, it's gaeilge. Gaelic is Scottish. I'm sorry, it was just killing me. You're still the best! ‚ú®
Parents: you‚Äôre very loud 
Jack: what can I say except, IM IRISH
Jacksepticeye- the only person who can preach equality whilst making a joke that covers up his broken lamp
It cured mine :p i didnt laugh cause i am dead inside but i smiled
Wow Sean way to trigger people who are on bad terms with their fathers
I wish I wasn't broke af so I could join the channel

Jack: "I hope they made you laugh, I hope they made you smile if they didn't what's wrong with you. Are you dead inside? What does that say about your relationship with your dad?"
me: "Oh jack...jack jack jack.... why yes I am dead inside, as for the second.... oh you don't want to open that can of worms."
I can't forge a hammer but I can forge a signature
I like this "new" Sean!

If you see a meme you may be entitled to financial compensation
Sorry Jack but... you can't be a viking. You don't have a long enough beard.
I wonder if someone at Coke watches his videos?
depression killed!
seans accent is slowly fading
I will call this show "Memeseptic Master Class with Jacksepticeye" from now on. xD
That poor lamp is crying out in pain, Jack.

You can really see that Jack is Irish when he whips those ears out. Also... who doesn't come to this challenge for creaming and swearing?
My last name means Son of Fire
I had a dream were I'm at school and jack walks in, slams the glass mirror yelling laugh. I know want to hit everything, including people yelling laugh
Why would Coke sponsor you when you do it for free anyway?
I always hold cups like that and I never new why but I started when I watched jacksepticeye and my friends always comment on it
Is it weird that I thought it said MEXICAN in the background before it focused
Great, Jacksepticeye made a Meme Review-
I love how Se√°n is salty over Coke looking over him, when MatPat‚Äôs been doing that with Diet Coke for years
2 seconds in and I'm already confused... "horse noises"?  XD
Se√°n already cures my daily depression just by showing up every day and being himself
he was going to the forgotten lands due to the paradoxes of the green screen
Ya know, you actually cured my gf's depression after her grandfather died.
9:03 ITS NOT GREEN SCREEN THERES A REFLECTION IN THE BOARD. YOU CANT FOOL US JACK
Yes again
Mine is one punch man
Jack you have nothing on me because I don‚Äôt even hold my cups
I have a really good video game suggestion for you. You should play Tales of Berseria or any of the Tales games because i love the story behind it all
Me: Ye Sean's name is easy to pronounce
4:14 - no
8:22 no, you're a Rakkshassa.
Call it JSE‚Äôs depression DESTROYING show
my mom's irish and she scream as much as you lol
Nope, no relationship with dad. Although, still I get a card once in a while. The quiet is a family thing/ issue best left alone. Especially since my mom raised me and my sibs. on her own. She claims she owes me for the yrs. I've been taken care of her when I claim I owe her my life for better or worse she's my mom. If not for her I wouldn't be here. Even if we irritate each other we know when to give space and when the other needs some one to yell at, talk to or even a little understanding.   I know me yelling back at her is disrespectful but sometimes it helps her to understand she's not the only one having a bad day and I'd leave her when she's ready to be left alone. other times I'd walk away and she'd follow so that's the reason for yelling back. I'd like to be calmer.
did anyone else think of the crab picture at 5:46 as Jack representing Connor from dbh and Bryan Dechart's crabby video....?
Ayyyy I‚Äôm a Viking too!! I‚Äôm related to king Bluetooth. He was a ruthless Viking king (Bluetooth was named after him).so that‚Äôs pretty cool.
your ears ?
Jackie don't worry there's a thing called Pepsi-Cola you still have a chance
jack is cute when he gets like this
Jack if you can cure my decade long depression I‚Äôll owe you my life
Was casually drinking coke cola
real or fake? Look at the white board reflection and it should move and change if real when he moves
0:30 Thank you Jack. I am very much in need of this right now üôÉ
Fake irish man

Jack trying to get Coke to sponsor him is like Arin trying to get Wendy's to sponsor him.
üòéüëågot you
Jack you should go up and hit the skeleton with your knife, it'll trigger some events (life if you want jack to see this)
Game: Snow Plant
Jack : "Snow Plant"
me : Snow Plant
Snow Plant : Snow plant
Jack: my videos helped the developers find bugs.
also Jack: walks through stairs
1:35
Jack: My game is frozen..
Me: Some might say, the game is below zero
My name is Connor. I'm the Cyclops sent by Vehicle Bay.
Jack there‚Äôs a secret bunker around the bridge (like if you want jack to see this)
26:18
Jack:Who put those there?
Me:You... You died there jacküòÇ
Me: "OH, Sean loved Detroit, but I don't think he's really into it anymore..."

Sean: ~Wearing a haircut similar to Kamski's, and names his hover bike Hank~

Me: "....*he's subcounciously obsessed.*
Jack: Theres a battery and lubricant on the ground?
Jack: Who left those here?
Me: ITS YOUR GEAR FROM BEFORE
Jack: Well its good for me.
Me: Facepalm*
Jack, first you name the Sea Truck Traci and now the SnowFox Hank... 

Is anyone else seeing a theme here? 
Btw Jack if you get killed by a snow stalker then you will get an exclusive death animation! 



Like so jack can see!
Is "Pengwing" actually a reference to Benedict Cumberbatch? üòÇüòÇ
Jack when he goes to a new place: 
Oh I've seen this all before
Goes to a place he has been:
Oh hey that's new
2:49 jack talking about bugs in early days
Game: [press F8 to report bug]
Jack: I can do flips!

Me: Has flashbacks to Skate 3 and Betty

Like (if u want) so Jack can see!

Simon the Snowfox..
Hank the Hoverpad..
Jack: oooohh I'm gonna have to go back and get-
PDA: 30 seconds
5:33
8:21  "Assessment: Avoid"

I think that's the most ironic thing I've seen in a long time.  You've got to get super close to a clearly hostile creature, getting right up in its face to scan it, and pretty much the only info you get is a visual description (which you can pick up on yourself...from a distance) and a warning to stay away from it.  Gee, thanks game!  There's no way we couldn't have figured those things out just by watching the damn thing!

Love this series.  It's so great to watch a game come along like this, especially since the developers actually finish their projects (unlike half of the games on steam)!  Can't wait to see more
"I don't think he really gonna roll out the read carpet and-"
icicle rolls out in front of him
lol the timing
Jack you can use your knife on the big skeleton and get kharaa infection item which you can send in the rocket!


- Like so jack sees this! ‚ô•
Just wait until the Shadow leviathan is added
Perfect start to a re-visit
Jack: Where am I ??????
What have i done????

HAHAHAHAHa!!!!
Jack: its snowing..
Me: CORRECTION, HAILING. ICE IS FALLING, NOT SNOW.
15:14
I just realized those glowing rock bridges are the tentacles from the leviathan in subnautica
Jack playing Subnautica after a long time:

I love the slower pace of your play Jack, I think we enjoy following you on an emotional journey of discovery.
Me:* sees the weird monster thing *
Also me:* unholy screaming *
Gleefully says the intro along with Jack


TOP O' THE MORNIN TO YE LADDIES My name is Jack Septiceye and welcome back to Subnauseo-- ‡≤†_‡≤†
"There's just a battery and a lubricant lying around"

Everything is a dildo if you're brave enough
Jack: Ooh a snow stalker , looks friendly...
God the nostalgia. It‚Äôs been 5 years since I watched your videos last and I‚Äôm glad to see them again.
If I'm not wrong it can drive on water(Hank)
"Good lord this looks like going through the birth canal again"

Game:the prawn suit is a vehicle
Jack:well yes but actually no
Aww you didn't call it Sub-Nauseous. Oh well still gonna like and watch the vid anyways xD
Edit: That Snowfox made me a tad nauseous, doesn't help that I was eating food before-hand.
he should call the snow fox Kath like from Kath and Kim get it hah kats "foxy" my fellow Australians will like this
And plz play some of the SCP games plz thx
"AH, lubricant.. THIS IS LOOKING GOOD!" XD
You should name snow fox Gregory or Greg
You know like Greg from Night in the Woods
Jack when the full game is out (story/features etc) you should start a new save and play from the beginning to get the full effect!
I think Chelicerate is pronounce Sche-lis-erat
Maybe go back to the original place that crashed and got covered by snow.
Jack driving the hoverbike legit gave me motion sickness, man. Ugh
Jack what's something big 

game:so we need that dragon
29:58 "Imma call it Hank" Now whenever you're about to ride it, you can slap it and say "Wake up, lieutenant!" :P
Jack why haven't you  bought a subnatuica shirt , posters etc.
You can go on the water I think with the hover bike
I was thinking Sarah for the snow fox but idk what im tAlkin about
Jack: [Builds Snowfox]
Jack, mentally: Now this is Podracing!
I love how all of these awsome, badass vehicles Jack names relatively "regular" names
Jack: What have I done? üòÇüòÇ
jack you had the chance to call your snowfox Vixen....what are you doing........
Jack that base thing seems to be in a placeholder because it is like that on mine.

 if you get up there there is nothing in the building and you can walk through the buildings walls

But most importantly
He bring intro bacc

Woah! The hover bike looks like a sparrow from Destiny
i dont think jacksepticeye needs clickbait.  his channel isn't dying and theres millions of people like me (who've been here since 2014) and a place in our heart always belongs to him.  he can be straight forward in his video titles and still get our click and enjoyment.
Jack's title: WHAT IS THAT THING

Imagine Sara the snow fox

Take a sample from frozen skeleton, and there is more places in this aera.
PS: Snow Stalkers and Chelicerate make a good death animations of your characterüòè.

NEVER GIVE JACK A HOVERBIKE
Personally I would've called the Snowfox Vic, cause vixen is a female fox and it goes with the whole naming vehicles after women. Sally..Maria...Vic.. y'know?
I'm passive agressively waiting for Satisfactory ;)

I'm so excited to see his reaction when he sees the shadow leviathan.
First thought when seeing the snowfox

IT'S A PODRACER!
Jack: Oh crap I only have 20 power!
Continues to use the boosters
I love long playtrough series. Just sayin' it. Now have a nice day if you found this comment

Imagine if Below Zero got multiplayer. We could have Snowfox races, and they'd be hella fun.
Hanky the snowfox
jack: "link would be proud, Hah! HAOUUGHH."
You can carry the snow fox and there is another place you missed.
Its in a cave and its just across from the place you found(the one with giant doors)
when I saw the chelicerate in the preview image my first thought was "I t is going to appear very far i-" 
chelicerate appears almost 4 minutes in
"WELL THEN WASN'T EXPECTING THAT!"
Me 5 years ago: why u got scaried?

Me now after playing the game: logical
Wow it's 3d printing!

Wow you take forever, don't cha?


Anyone who has used a 3d printer: O______________e

JACK THERE IS A GAME YOU HAVE TO PLAY






It's called Just shapes and Beats. It's a bullet hell game and its a lot like undertale, which I know you enjoyed. It is a PC game. It also has cool music that I know you will love. Please read this and maybe consider playing it.
I've been with I always I wait for each video you post you're the only one I watch subnautica below zero
MeanWhile: Jack is destroying the ecosystem by bumping to fishes

I'm a simple man: I see a jacksepticeye video with subnautica in the title, I click like.
It's chelicerate 

Che- like chess-li like like-Ci-like city and rate chelicarate
It's been way too long since I heard that opening. It's like therapy for my soul.
Should play Subnautica with a heart rate monitor üòÇ
I should use one just watching
i love this series. Ah my GLANKLES!
That "f8 to report bugs" popped up with perfect timing lol
Jack:I‚Äôma call it Hank!
My brain: I lIkE dOgS
That futurama reference :D ahhh i miss that show "You win again, Gravity!"
Jack: "It's snowing"

Me: "That's hail."
Jack, you said so many incriminating things in this video
"Oh lubricant!"
"Is it gonna fit, I hope it's gonna fit"
"This is not so good for tight spaces!"
Is that really called a Pengwing?! Like how Benadryl Cumberpatch pronounces penguin?! üòÇüêß
Subnoutica 1=skulls in lava 
Subnoutica 2= skulls in ice
when you have motion sickness and he uses the snow fox XD
Jacksepticeye running into fish in Subnautica:

please play more subnautica(like if u agree)
Jack: Goes on land
BYE BYE, OCEAN
You should call the hover bike Felix the snow fox
Holy motion sickness batman, the snow fox is a ride and a half.
Jack: soo.. the hoverpad is useless 

A FEW MOMENTS LATER


Jack: oohh you need the hoverpad to build the snow fox
Sea truck tracy hoverbike harry /snowfox sonia
I don't think he's gonna roll out the red carpet ....

Ice rolls in front of him
Explores new area*
Past Jack: I wonder if this hurts me...(stands in pink volcano thing)
Past Jack: AhHhHHh  yup that definitely can kill me.
Future Jack: The creators told me to stay away from anything new because it could kill me.
smh lol
You were wondering what to call the snow fox, ide say it‚Äôs more like a speeder from star wars
I‚Äôll never forget that vid when jack found the reefbacks for the first time and lost his shit. I think that was the vid that got me so In love with this series. So glad he‚Äôs continuing :)
furious clicking in the background intensifies
There r new tabs characters you can find in maps by looking for their weapons
The Skelton is probably a placeholder for something cooler
I love how this game makes fun of how Benedict Cumberbatch pronounced "penguins" in that one nature video. XD
I like how sean saw the chelicerate the same way he saw the reaper just a tail swiming in the distance
You should 100% play Astroneer!
i think by now subnautica actuall needs a map-tool... something that just draws a map of your general area as you go.
I literally refuse to watch anything below zero related except your videos until you finish the full game when it comes out. This game is so amazing!
WE NEED MORE SATISFACTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh, oh, oh me, me!
Sean: Yes?
Me: is it a unisicle?
(Sorry if there is grammar errores)
JAACK! PLZ MORE LIFE IS STRANGE!!!!
Love the sum 41 reference in the description. I absolutely love sum 41.

Icicle: rolls in front of him
Sean you need to grow your beard MORE
U r my favorite to watch and you always make me laugh and plz play some of the SCP games and I'm very grateful that you r a YouTuber and I would go crazy if you were not one just do me a favor and plz play one SCP game thx u my favorite YouTuber.
Also since you named your Snowfox Hank, you gotta name your Prawn Suit Connor in this game!!!
BTW the Chelicerate is pronounced Sha lis erit sorry if I'm being rude
My motto is run first, ask questions later

RUN JACK, RUUNNN
Hey Jacksepticeye I just started to play subnatica in survival mode
Quick question.... Are you going to replay below zero when it's finished just like you did with subnautica???
Jack: "What should we call the snowfox? Foxy? That's a little  too generic. Imma call it Hank!"
Also Jack: *Named his starting pod in Subnautica, "Hank"*
The hoverbike is like those podracers from Star Wars
3:19

Jacksepticeye: oh god the games glitching
Me: the whales are evolving
This game is so amazing, and it just gets better the more that I watch you play it, Jack!!!

Jack: imma call it hank
Hey jack when are u going to do more satisfactory
‚ÄúAh gosh I am destroying the ecosystem‚Äù
He says purposely running in to a fish
Ice lily-pads?

You mean ice bergs?
XD
If this is hank then the next one should be connor...








Get it ?!
I thought the snowfox was a creature. I have been lied to!!!! I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!
Yes I have been waiting for more subnautica
Jack: "Oh god im destroying the ecosystem!"




Also Jack: 
Snowfox is just snow seaglide
I love jack and how he takes his time with the games. I think it is great because those kids or people who can not pay for the game can kind of experience that with him. LOVE YOU JACK
Jack worries of a video game ecosystem.. damn it be like that sometimes.
I thought Jack (Sean) couldn't swear due to Article 13
Me: That cavern looks like a vagina....
Jack: It's like I'm going through the birth canal again. 
Me: Dead af
Jack do more slime rancher
30:00 now this is pod racing
Hey jack this is my first video since I got grounded,u are my inspiration t be a youtuber
septicfox or jacksepticfox‚Ä¶ I like septicfox tho
We love the content, the way you take your time and upload long episodes , slow and steady wins the race , everyone else may be wanting fast content but with fast content comes with running out of content... Consistency is key... Keep up the good work, it's quality content üíö
Jack do more subnatica below zero videos
Omg Jack you watch neature walk, that's so funny, I never thought someone I watched would quote that in a video üòÇ
OMFG They added a benedict cumberbatch meme to the game. He always says pengwing instead of penguin
It would be awesome if they added a more versatile vehicle for land navigation. What about something that could traverse both? Something like a PRAWN suit but more suited to navigating land like jumping up cliffs and running fast.
I remember watching him play the original game when he was still coming out with videos.




This is epic.
Jack I watch you specifically because you take the time to enjoy the games! And I know I'm not alone. You keep being you and we'll always be here.
the 45th ice age 5091 (colorized)
‚Äúchecilerates‚Äù at the opening screen, funny typo lol
Jack: that‚Äôs too generic
Also jack: let‚Äôs name it hank
I can sum this game up for me in one word:

ANXIETY
Did it show an option to pick up the snowfox?
Born of the new character, Hank
game: hover-pad
Jack (an intellectual): bike plate
Brian: Stewie why do you but so much emphasis on the ‚ÄúH‚Äù
Below Zero in Subnautica Below Zero stands for below zero frames per second
Yay for more Subnautica!! :D
A base under the giant frozen skeleton would look epic üòª
Don‚Äôt worry Jack,I‚Äôd ride Hank too. üòâ
Who else did the name hank remind him/her of Detroit Become Human??
It's a snow plant.
And this... is a snow plant.
This however, is a snow plant.
Surprisingly, it's a snow plant.
Snow plant...
Is it really a snow plant?
Behold! A snow plant.
Eh? There's 2 titanium inside this.
U sould call the hover bike glider it seems a good name for it
It's funny how your game froze well playing an ice map
"Pengwing" - Benedict Cumberbatch, trying to say Penguin circa 2014
chelicerate the new leviathan is like below zero's reaper
Jack: there is a whale in the ice
Jack: game found out the whale is not supposed to be in there
Jack: so the game teleported it to the sky
Wow a whale probably supposed to be in the sky not in the water
sounds lit to me
YES I WAS WAITING FOR PART 8 AND IM DO GLAD WE GOT IT WOOOOOOOOO!
Bro where da duck is Satisfactory
If Jack got a second snow fox who thinks it should be named Conner. You know Hank and Conner... Detroit: Become Human...
A joke for the lockers;
I guess that base got Snowden üòâüëå
Keep an eye out when you are exploring the Caves in the Glacial Basin. You will come across a decent food/water item.
Game dev: Snow Plant
Jack: Snow Plant
everyone:  . . . Snow Plant
me: guess that is a Snow Plant
edit: should call the bike Dizzy cause it makes you dizzy
i love your dedication to quality over quantity :)
Jack: i want a collosal sea monster"
Also Jack: gets scared of a regular sized leviathan
Yessss, neature walk
Be the last bastion of lets players taking their time, sometimes its about the journey, not the reward!
I heard they updated the game! there is a shadow leviathan or something.
Now this is podracing!
Play slime rancher again bring back the nostalgia
I think you can hover above the water with hank/seafox try it you dont lose alot if it doesnt work
Pengwing is how Benedict Cumberbatch pronounces penguin
The hover bike actually made me nauseous and I had to look away. "I don't have motion sickness." I thought "it'll be fine" I thought. ü§¢
Jack , make another SnowFox and call it Connor .
I was waiting for him to walk through the stairs. I laughed harder then I should have at his confused reaction XD
No one:
Sean: i got my EyEs bacK
Going through the birth canal again??? So you remember the FIRST time??? LOL
AH my Glankles! üòÇüòÇ I love it
Jack the sea truck can attach to karts
You should Keep playing your games slowly.. It's the kind of allure that only your, and those like yours' channels have. c;
JAAAAAACK Name it Foxy Roxy
7:03

Dont tempt fate again jack... Already happened with the Ghost Reaper Leviathon...
I think the docking pod for the truck is to carry the sniwfox
They should make subnautica VR version
now THIS is podracing!
Jack Life is strange 2 ep 3 comes out may 9th!
Playing the original subnautica for the first time: I don't wanna be in the water it's scary and dark!

Playing below zero for the first time: Let me back in the water being on land is too dangerous! ;_;
I have a better name for the snowfox  "Simon" (Simon snowfox)üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Thanks youtube just got the notification today
Jack: picks up lubricant 

Jack: this is looking good
NAME THE SNOWFOX JUPITER ?????!!!!!!!!!
Snowfox fred
Like if agree
Snowfox Steve hahahaha would have been a funny throwback
Jack:There's just a random lubricant and battery sitting here.
Also Jack 20 Minutes ago:Died at that exact same spot from fall damage.
You dropped it sherlock!
I love long series because I get to watch my favorite YouTubers more.
I think you should take your time with this series.
U should name it Snowfox Sandy
yeah ur game isn't broken mine is that way too
Snowi the fox
2:06 ‚ÄúI remember the really early days, they just vanished‚Äù
"This is bad news bears..."
hops off ledge
ad plays
Me: Well that was well timed
Edit: Ah. He died.
Imagine the snowfox in VR
hey, jack i just wanted to tell you that if you have a lot of dead batteries and no battery charging station then you can just make scanners with those batteries and when you made the scanners you can take them out and the batteries will be fully charged. it's just that you will have a lot of scanners.
I love the way you play Subnauseous and TABS, please don't ever change them <3
I missed this intro ‚ô•Ô∏è
Please keep making these videos as well as the satisfactory one with robin
The game looks cool everytime, but when you can't play on everything max, than it's not so beatiful
Yes jack scan the big scary thing that even the creators told you not go near
also the snowfox a quick and nimble little bastard of a bike
Funny jack moments

jack: what does a docking module do?

Me:  it‚Äôs in the name jack



Also I love how he says come of instead of come from
Do Beamng drive( BMG drive) it's so different! Please
Finely, I have been waiting for this for so long
At 4:05 is it just me or was that perfect timing because as soon as it was on screen the character like gasped
i love the subnautica series i hope they make more
plan for now get back into my dude jacksepticye lol
Jack- there's a battery and lubricant here! I mean, good for me, but who put them there?

Me- Jack... that's where you fell and died....
I want a baby snow stalker...or a plush.
A plush would be cool.
You should make an episode every week. But with shorter episodes, like 20 minutes
i loved that Hot Fuzz subtle reference
Weirdly specific: hit the frozen skeleton with your knife. Trust.
Upload this more often lol
Why couldn't he just load from the save point?
Sean I love your hair cut and btw my name is Sean William Mackay the same initials so I happy
Btw Snow Stalkers are related to normal Stalkers.
As soon as Jack said pengwing all I could think was ‚Äú Bendyboi Coblermunch would be proud. ‚Äù
Well jack, I gett your view on the maximum content thing, but
Everything you uploads, does get louds of views!
We love watching just stupid stuff of you even if there‚Äôs no content
Hey Jack what ever happened to your Satisfactory series?
My tv rattles every time his voice goes deepüòÇüòÇ
12:55 And that there is the uvula.

Oh... so it‚Äôs a girl cavern...
Go to 12:25 click play, close your eyes and listen
the hoverbike can go underwater
You can tell that it's an aspen tree because of the way it is.
I love the music for the snowscape.  So pretty and kinda solemn, like Skyrim.  Also, I've seen boats handle better than that hoverbike.  Yikes.

I love that they allow us to play this as they make it.  It's like one gigantic teaser, like the huge skeleton in the ice.  "Heyyyyy lookie what you'll get to have later one!"  Yes, please and more of that!
Jack please play more soon. Really soon. Plus this series is awsome so far
If I wanted to watch people go straight to doing dumb stuff on Subnautica I'd have found another youtuber and not watched all 71 episodes of Subnautica that you've released over the years! I love when a new subnautica video is uploaded and I look forward to it every single time! Keep up the good work and I will see you my dude! IN THE NEXT VIDEO!
hey jack when you went in the dark area last ep. and when you had some diologe Margaret you get the orange tablet then you CAN go back to the spawn area and go into the percuser area at the beggening
 with the tabet go watch IGP on how to get up there but in that vid there ARE spoilers hope you watch this mate :)
More! Nice uploafs
12:23 - 12:39 
Listen to that part with your eyes closed
Even now the reaper still warped though the ground after the game was released
Jack this bike can hover on water to try it and you can pick the bike up also
does this fit? oooegh why did i bring you here...
this feels like going through the birth canal again. 
i thought i'd enter one hole and come out the other
HOLY COOKIES! the blizzard is TERRIFYING!! O_O!
You know you can use the snowfox on water right?
Pengwing? Okay, that is totally a reference to Benedict Cumberbatch.
My Irish Gladiator, I will will watch this 3 minute ad for your revenue...
Sean always makes me laugh every time he says glakles
What happened to subtarcicpark
I'm from Poland üáµüá±
goes back to the episode of Subnautica where Jack legit was hunting the reaper laviathin yup....
Jack how long is your hair now?
The docking module is for the prawn suit so you can take it with you on the seatruck
Jack i think I got your time capsule from the first game or one inspired by you
12:24 - 13:05 with your eyes closed
29:53 jack i feel hurt cause my dogs name is Foxie and she lovely she also heard you say her name and responded to it
jack u can fly the snow fox  by going into the guyzer then boost
Snow plant is snow plant
Snow plant is love snow plant is life
At 19:27 what it feels like being flashbanged in csgo
it requires power for building the bike...
Jack: gaming series doesnt get as many views anymore

Youtube: #6 trending for youtube gaming
When the game comes out fully do a series of this please
your my fav youtuber jacksepticeye
Ps. Can u play happy wheels again plz
Name it Snowfox freddy
I just realized, maybe pengwings are named after what Benedict Cumberbatch says ü§îüò±üòÇ
Maybe it‚Äôs just me being slow üòÇ
7:53 game theory: jack has more than one sphincter
is your name spelled Sean or Shawn?
we have hank. but wheres connor? wheres our boi the android sent by cyberlife
‚ÄúNew Blueprint Aqua‚Äôd‚Äù
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT!!!!!
Sean you should play rainbow 6 siege
Jack we are all here for you.üôèüôåüôåüôåüëÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Dude I like the long exploring videos. Is it too much work to upload two versions? I'd watch all the ads in the big ones just so I could watch them
Fun Fact: this game is actually the prequel to the first Ice Age movie.
4546B is the Australia of the galaxy. Everything kills you.
DID SOMEBODY SAY CONTENT
You should name him 
Frostyboy
19:10 Snow hit really f**ken fast
I like how you heal really slow cause it keep you soo conscious...
It's probably new creatures in the game but that probably rare to activate
The ad at the beginning of the video involved people slapping each other and themselves in the face. As soon as I could I skipped. Making it slap, slap, SLAP "TOP OF THE MORNIN"
Ps jack im pretty sure the snow fox can go on water
Did anyone notice how when he was talking about bugs from the last Subnautica, an icon popped up to tell him :"If you notice any bugs please give us your feedback" LOL üòÅ
I think u can pick up baby snow stalkers
in the  normal subnautica you can tame a  Reaper Leviathan  using peepers
The ocean makes me want to run I hate the idea of stuff sneaking up from underneath me
15:13 you should be Nugget at this point jack üòÇ
Jack the chelicerate and the snow stalker have awesome killing animations you should try it out ;)
bro u neeeeed to chec the actual snow fox
I think the big circle you drove around in was designed as something of a natural race track of ice caves to test out the handling and control of the Snowfox. Nothing really there at the moment, but looks cool and serves testing purposes.
Ok, plan for now...  
Yes
I wish I could be on this map so I could terrorize you again jack!
I think snowfox can go on the water
Keep up the good work sean
27:13 YOU MISSED A FRAGMENT DAMN IT.
NOW THIS IS PODRACING
There has been a micro update yesterday. Maybe something to check out?
in tabs you can make a mace spinner become a tornado when you power them up with cheer leaders I swear it not a mod please trust me
Funniest subnotica vid ever :)
XD the bike is amazing!!
"THAT CLENCHED EVERY SFINKER THAT I HAVE"
That was a very majestic Pangwang
Jack play sekrio shadows die twice
Still think calling it "Sub zero" was a missed opportunity...

Maybe it's to avoid copyright
There‚Äôs is a death animation for the chelicerate and snow stalker, along with an unfinished biome (It‚Äôs still cool tho). Alsooo you missed a place hidden in the wall of the glacial basin, which you literally passed by XD. Make another episode of this game its awesome.







Get killed by the chelicerate pls üëπ
there is a prawn suit in Below Zero that you can pack into your sea bus using the docking moduel (like if you want jack to see this)
The hoverbike could maybe be called Howard, if you change your mind? Anyway, I love your vids and this series, and keep up the good work! Like a BOSS!
hank from king of the hill
Finally! Love ya Jack! This series is the best!
I vote calling it the Sexy Foxy
Glankles will be the death of us . I tell you
Oh God. Never drive that bike again
nice haircut
You know what I'm about to do

I AM A STEGOSAURUS
God damn it, that pretty neat reference. THIS IS AN ASPEN!
It‚Äôs nature üòâüòÇüëåüèª
handles like a bistro! (cant be your friend if you dont know what its from) haha
Name it Snowfox sandy
complains about darkness, never builds a flashlight
34:23 That‚Äôs the same skeleton in the Lost River and the Precursor Research Facility just more snowy!
Please make more of these i miss subnautica so this is a great replacement
i remember the good old days when games came out fully released and finished, and not these early access messes that are half done for full price
The septic speedster
the chelicerate can do a one hit ko if you go in its mouth that also has an excluesive death animation
pls make the next video soon i love this game
MY COMMENT WAS SEEN! I think.
what happened to normal subnautica
And yes that Ice Island is indeed.. "cool" üòé
Thanks Jack because i saw this episode i was interested and just looked all the old subnatica series from the beginning. And i had so much fun and emotions watching you it was a great experience and i am happy i had it. I love Subnautica <3
You should have named it mike so it could be called mike the hover bike.
I Love The Quiet Snow Stalker!
checilerates? chelicerates, they meant? >:D (chelicerates are spiders, scorpions,... and such)

oh, the red and shrimpy boy is called a chelicerate... I think he can swallow you whole
I LOVE BAL...SNOWWW!
If you didn't notice in the birth canal there was air pockets
Everyone knows you don't take Penguins back to their moms! You throw them off cliffs! Into the abyss!
At 31:02 he means ‚Äúwell yes, but actually no.‚Äù
I just pronounce Chelicerate "chocolate"
Jack! you can pet the tiny ice bear thing
26:16 you died there probably
DUH
20:06 Snowstalker suddenly smacks Jack. Jack needs some fluid intake...
How deep do they plan on having the seatruck being able to go
Jake make a thumper
I thinks that's the old one now is updated I think you know your video
Is it me or does this affect for everyone that jack has no thumbnail?
Dear lord, it's good to see ya! I've been with you before your early gta days, and love the whole channel! Stay with you always!
Anyone else love how he lines up he center of the screen with the dot?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there is anything else to see‚Äù... a few seconds later passes by the small secret base
Jack:gimme more big creatuers 

Subnotica develeopers:is that all i am to u a pile of big creatuers
nobody:

absolutely nobody:





Jack: wHaTs uP lAddiEs JaCksEpticeye hErE
I‚Äôm pretty sure jack passed under an air pocket at about 24:32
If that is Hank.... Then who is Conner (I know Detroit: Become Human is a old series but still... :p)
I would call the snow fox swifter
You can  float over water with hank
YES!!! FINALLY!! Ive been waiting for this and have been avoiding every other youtubers sbz play through because i love experiencing it for the first time with jack!!
jack: Oh god can you even fit
Me an 18 year old: that's what she said
Name it SnowFox Scott
Why is my hover bike bugged, it moves a a snails pace
Jack said can I scan them and gets bit at  the start then he said I'm going to keep a safe distance

What is this world coming to?
2080ti crippled by low poly game :(
Jack You Should Try To Find All The Hidden Units In TABS, They Are Pretty Fun to Use
When custom units option comes up make Kratos and Atreus if possible
This is still my favourite episode in totally accurate battle simulator
8:16 Rodger! Rodger saw his neck and you know what he said? 
An add pops up. 
Me: okay, I'm reading through the comments.
Jack:
Looks at priest's croch

"OH THATS FANTASTIC"
Hey jack, I'm surprised you haven't found the secret units yet

 The Mace Spinner, and Executioner from the medieval maps.
 

Artemis and Teacher from the Greek areas
 

Tree giant from the farmer areas (I think) 
 

Samurai giant, shogun, and sensei from the new dynasty map. 


 Snow giant from the Viking area

 And the Cheerleaders from one of the Stone Age maps

You can find them when you look around during the deployment phase, just find their weapons.

(like so jack sees it)

Kung Pow is the best.

I think it was real background tho
I was hoping like a bunch of firework-dudes Vs. 1 ..like .. I dunno.. king? Or no! Omg! 1 Mammoth!!!!! Do it please!
And also whatchas(?) Vs. Valkiries(?)
Ad pops up: Hustle Castle: Make your own castle! Jack: it's free real estate
Jack, you should have 100s of priests boosting one peasant
Dynasty (Die-nis-tea) ps 9 more hidden units
You should find all the secret units, I think you'll like what a bunch of cheerleaders do to a hwacha.
And that is how the mammoth went extinct
that background is real
In tabs do 5 ice giants vs 5 mammoths
Hey Sean, love the vids. How about firework arrows against the mammoths to see if they go flying.
GET THE SECRET UNITS!! They're extremely fun to play with :)
Hey how about fireworks against mammoths?
That‚Äôs 3 overwatch maps smushed together it‚Äôs Hanamura, Iliois and the second stage of Nepal BTW fake background

Everybody: Jack, look out for secret units.

Jack: STEVE! ROGER! ONWAAAAAARD!!!!
Mammoth vs. fireworks like if you wanna see that too!
Jack: I don't have DRAGONS.
Me: You could have a god. ARTEMIS.
the broken lamp gives away if it's real or fake

I Love The Quiet Fireworks!!!
FIND THE SECRET UNITS JACK     I BELIEVE IN YOUUU!!!!!
Fake background. Calling it here.



Spoiler
I was correct. Yay?
"Roger looked at his neck, and you know what he said?" (ad plays) 'my social security number is...'
There are 12 secret characters!
Some are rather boring, but a lot of em are extremely fun.
Especially the mace spinner and the cheerleader!
Putting tons of cheerleaders near a mace spinner or a hwacha brings ultimate destruction to the enemy.
Fake your head has a slllight outline to it, and I believe that you are using the old timey effect to mask that.
Edit: well, not you but Robin.
Speaking of overwatch, Jack please start uploading more overwatch.
i loved when you played it, but now you dont and now im sadboy

There are secret units that you unlock by finding hidden weapons in some of the levels.  There are 2 or 3 on the Dynasty map.  Look around the pavilion roof for one, and then there is a katana hidden on the outside edge of the map somewhere.  Just look at them close up and they will glow until you get notified of the unlock.  There are giants, gods, and some silly things like cheer leaders.
try the new monkey king plz

Great wake up in the morning and can‚Äôt wait to watch jacksepticeye, I click on the video AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH that woke me up for sure
7:56 Fun Fact: if you're ever attacked by a goose, grab it by the neck and do one of two options. Give it a light squeeze, not enough to choke the animal, but enough to let it know that you're more powerful and in control. Then you can either do this next step or just immediately skip to this and ignore the first part: throw the goose as far as you can.
I thought this was a compilation of Sean screaming. Is not but there should be one!

Introducing jacksepticeye

The irish tyler1
caught By Police
Me: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
the "I smell pennies" guy must feel so mad because he didn't really get much fame while everyone else did. The pennies one from the start was a video using the track. The original is extremely funny
If you didn't chuckle you might be dead 

... Oh I'm dead inside
Thought it was gonna be screaming memes replaced with audio of your screams. Haha, still a good video regardless.
Wait... look at Jack's hair. I barely see grey in his hair, is he getting... OLD?

Edit: look at the bottom of his hair on top of his forehead
1st of all I died laughing so hard I accidentally triggered my asthma.
2nd of all ,"did they die?" Is that really the first question you ask Jack?  Although,,,, me too though.
8:52 "Is this all my channel is now?"
Jack...your channel was filled with screams before as well...
some of the people in Ireland ARE wildlife!!!! lmao!!!
It is Wednesday my dudes 2:42
watches at 1 am without headphones in the living room
i started laughing so hard that my 5 year old brother told me to shush
He screams
You scream
I scream
WE ALL SCREAM PERFECTLY
"All we're stuck with is stupid TikTok, which isn't funny"
Clearly you haven't used it correctly
thus has to be my favorite jse video of all time

his laugh is so pure <3
I've Been Laughing Straight For The Entire Video, I'm At 8:48 Right Now. I'm Still Laughing As I'm Typing This!
Okay, when he said RIP in peace, that made me think of raccooneggs lol
jack: "I like physical violence" but also the same guy who's heart melts when he sees puppies.
Sean: now thats the one m lookin for
Turns MiNi POnY taiL
Me: ha ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Tom cat might be your spirit animal.. x'D
9:01, going into battle, realising the opponent is JOHN WICK!

It makes me very hap.
Omg you like the guy screaming the AA AAA AAAA

That's not the original "I smell pennies" video, but it's a meme that originated of Tik Tok
jack screams me screams in school my friends in school NANI
You're not alone lmao
Cutaway screams are literally my entire sense of humor and i am easily entertained by such trivial things
4:50 i swear that looks exactly like my dog and it is something she does all the time.
I love Tom and Jerry. It was a childhood classic. X3
Tom: * Screams *
Transitions to Big Enough Scream
"But Sean that's evey video you d-"

'SHUT UP"

"He says as he immediately proves your point"

at 9:10 I was drinking water and it all just shot out of my nose XDD
what if Jacksepticeye did Toms voice with him yelling
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just suddenly a father of geese‚Äù. 

Jack suddenly runs through his backyard, a trail of ducklings waddling behind, then the video cuts out
that first one wasnt cut well
6:18 TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA LADDYS!!
I wonder if his neighbors hate him bc he‚Äôs so loud
"I used to be irish like you, until I got a geese to the knee..."
"Perfectly cut anything is my favorite."

I believe the "I smell pennies" meme originated on TikTok with a guy wearing a black robe, bowler hat, and plague doctor mask who turns on lights and says "I SMELL PENNIES" and runs after the guy with the camera
You know what they say: A Penny a day...
Now I want Tom&Jerry episodes overdubbed with Jack's screaming
And I thought every vids of Sean were loud this one is by far the best one
11:17 after the Tik Tok ad popped up
Anybody starting to notice that jacks hair cut makes him look like Joseph seed from far cry 5?
This is how we communicate now
Markiplier:"I'm so tired"

Jacksepticeye:"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH"

Well Jack, if you consider an island can have many different cities, it is possible to have more than one city centre.
For instance, the UK is an island with many cities, therefore many city centres.
Your Welcome.

Today has been a very hard and emotional day for me. Ive been constantly crying for like 9 hours. But only 5 seconds into the video and you're  already cheering me up, and making me laugh and smile when no one else could, or rather I have no one that could.

I've never asked for likes but if you can, please like this so that Jack may see how just by being himself and doing what he does can really help someone

If you look Closely at 8:04 EXACT FRAME, you can see he could have gotten 19 rather than 18... isnt much but its the Butterfly Effect. Small things make big changes.

Edit: FOUND ANOTHER BUT BETTER
If you go to , then go frame by frame on PC using the , and . buttons, you can see him get +69

Nice.
Yup actually liked before the vid even started. :)
Jack was giving an amazing @Contrapoints impression at the start.
‚ÄúI realized I‚Äôm screaming a bit loud.‚Äù
First- screaming is loud
Second- who ARE YOU?
Ey, where is satisfactory and sabnautica below zero bring it back
time code for when jack actually gets on the call plz?
Jack you‚Äôll always be a king to us, THE KING OF BOSS!!!!!


He‚Äôs my big inspiration to do video games for the first time!! üòã
Jack: "you're a  fun successful person"
Me: "I am?"
35:05 is what you came for üòú
If you wanna say thanks, I'd love your feedback on some of our game-play! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Jack has learned clickbait with the titleüòÇüòÇ love your vids jack, never give up
Wow jack we have the same last name what a coincidence
Can you teach me about Ireland i have a project about it and i need help
Sean! Puerto Rico (being relatively big) has 81 cities (so theoretically 81 city centers). That being said, an island as small as the ones in the game would probably normally have like 10+ ‚Äôcity centers‚Äô. If this was a joke and I don‚Äôt catch on just hit me with the r/whoooosh.
Thanks for letting him here 2019
You should make a video of the new game cyberpunk2077
Jack: ‚Äòhave you clicked like yet even though you haven‚Äôt seen the video‚Äô

Me: liked the video before it even loaded in
Aaaaaaaaactually, a triangle for example has 4 different centers: orthocenter, circumcenter, incenter and the centroid, which are all determined differently (unless the triangle is equilateral, in that case all centers are in the same place).
Wait, I've just exposed myself as a big nerd, ABORT ABORT!
9:18

Ah. A PokeAwesome reference. I see your a man of culture as well.
... Loud no. Me being deaf watching jacks vids no. Cursing. FUCCC-
JACKKKKKKKKK can you do some more vacation simulator?
We need more Satisfactory! Please don't tell me you've forgot the whole game after you said you were addicted to it!
I think that Jack put cocaine I his coffee just maybe and he almost might be drunk

What happened with that intro? Jfc. I swear you had a voice crack and tried playing it off xD
Jack, it's "unplugged" not "plugged out."
Hah, you didn't say we couldn't correct you for that! >=3
I just realized at the start of the vid he sounds kinda like Alaska Thunderfuck.
Jack: Islanders... I - Landers.. Islanders.
Me: SKYLANDERS
Jacksepticeye endorses:
 Coca-Cola Irish Flavour 
~~~Minty Time~~~~~
 "Doesn't taste so good."
Jack: "you're probably all wrapped up in blankets"

jack's epic eye does this ring any bells
Person:how did you die

I'm not ashamed though üòÇ
I miss the previous islands Jack made,I want to see them again.
I actually am in a blanket
Oi Jack, if you got the time, look up "Jacksepticeye voiceover" on youtube and enjoy that

Jack:Have you liked this video before it started?

Hello all I'm a bit late but that's okay right? As long as no one tells Jack we will all be fine right?
Holy crap I‚Äôve never been this early before.

Anyways, dat ASMR at the beginning lmao
Jack:  your breath smells bad.
Me: oh, ok.
The way he fitted everything into place appeased my slight OCD
:) This video made me happy Jack. Thanks for the upload!
Part of me says do it
Part of me says don't
I liked my own comment

I landorus,you landorus,I landorus
WE ALL LANDORUS
you sound like james in walking dead in the intro xD
Thanks for appreciating my addiction Jack‚úåüèªüòÇ
36:58  Sean, you missed the -10 for the temple, early on.  You might have been able to get more points by adding the wall around there, but I still don't think you would have made it to the next pack of things to place (you might have gotten +1 or +6 or something when you needed +27)...  You still did well.  Nice job.
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly he
Brought the top of the mornin bacc!
You should spend more time on one single island, until its fully crowded.
I love seeing the cute lil cities get spawned!
Jack can you suport me on my youtube chanol tipe in skullbreaker mod menu

Jack: I need more walls, and more halls!
Me: Fa lalalala lala lala?

37:07 "It's not all about doing your best, it's about not doing your worst" And now we have a "low effort" version of PMA: NNA (non-negative attitude) XD
This game lowkey reminds me of polytopia (which y'all should play, not just Jack)
Actually you can have multiple city centers but technically the biggest one is number one that‚Äôs what she saidü§£
Nice A-Team reference!
Just wanted to say thank you for making me laugh and helping me in a difficult point in life

If you build on a island more even with having the next unlocked you can get more points with the current buildings

6:38 he sounds like the radio demon from hazbin hotel. XD
Triangles, Incenter, Circumcenter, Centroid Mathematical Daborific Nae Nae
I miss the old Jack from 2 years ago where I stopped watching but I'm back :/
Seriously worried about the amount of Coke you are drinking.
But Sean, are you not building multiple cities, and therefore, would it not make sense to have multiple city centers? A single city doesn't need to take up the entire island.
(Also, for anyone curious, "Masons" are the guys that carve stones and turn them into bricks, if I'm correct.)
TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA LADIES
Jack commenting on how loud he is? Who are you

Sean: you‚Äôre comfy, with your blanket.

Me: throws off blanket NO. No~ wrong. I-
I swear you are spying on me jack.
Every time I am doing something or taking about something you either say something that either answers what I'm talking about, is extremely related to what I'm doing/ talking about, exactly what I'm talking about our doing.
That and when you said we are in blankets you were right. Then again you have at least one viewer doing exactly what you say they are doing.
8:26 metropolis? why does he say it like that üò¨
You shouldnt of waited on the other island because don‚Äôt you get more experience or whatever its called by leveling up or getting a higher score so you got a higher score and didnt get any experience for the next island so you wasted building and experience 
but whatever I might be wrong since I dont really know the game
30:44 I love that song

(HIGH DEMAND VIDEO) MORE DRUMS
Definitely addicted to your channel. Yes I did like the video before seeing it. üòÇ
Crest 3D soda
*shudder*
...xD COFFEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When will satisfactory come back
why did you name the video after something that takes 2 actual seconds in the final cut
0:55- Pffft, as if! sips Coke Zero, same great taste with zero sugar now with a hint of added vanilla 

*Proceeds to spill onto PMA hoodie
oooo he didnt do an overthetop intro

"Oh I just swallowed the mint by accident..."
               -Jackspidcy
Nice job have fun üòÄü§£ü§£üòá
Hello I am Conner the android sent by cyber life
thats tribore jack at the very beggining
Hey Jack actually you can have more than 1 city center if you have more than 1 city face palm
This game is satisfying, but do you want to know what's even more satisfying? Satisfactory, start playing it again, Jack.
Lol jack, if coke isn‚Äôt sponsoring you, you shouldn‚Äôt push their product. Just start hiding the label or pouring it into a cup before drinking it. Maybe see if Pepsi can sponsor you because coke won‚Äôt? Lol
I love how jack tries to be an ASMR pro in the beginning of the video
Yah, i just subscribed and limed it before it even started. Good hooks at the start jack.
Good job getting 22m subs
Are the pee breaks just not being edited out now? üòÇ
when you get a new big building (like market, circus or temple) you should build small buildings around where you want to put it so that you're sure to get the most points, cuse it won't give you any after you've placed it. So for me big buildings should never be placed first.
Jack there's a new Subnautica update and I can't say whats it about yaaawyyy.........
‚ÄòYou have an addiction to this channel‚Äô 

Low key 

TRUE
I love how the pee break is an ongoing joke now üòÇ
SATISFACTORY!
plz
PLAY SATISFACTORY PLEASE
Can I point out that Roblox has a more effective liking system than YouTube does
I miss night in the woods
I like that I thought this was ASMR but then it got loud and I was like nevermind that jack
I think you should play days gone and go back to your regular hair
Jack please play more finding Bigfoot I want to see jimmy average toes again
that "top of the mornin' to ya laddies" sounded like my old car's starter motor.
Are you cheating on us jack?? How could you?! :P
isn't it good to take the second pack of buildings because if some building needs more of another you could already have that?
This video is literally the best thing for "I'm 14 and this is deep."
When you've been training for your job and haven't had time for Sean or anyone else and your response hearing his voice and watching his video, "I miss you senpai and your coca-cola sponsor "not sponsor." Seriously coca-cola? Sponsor the man.
The fact that Robin just doesn't edit out the pee brakes is hilarious
Could you play banished again
Isn‚Äôt the statue an obelisk
Hey jack if you would have stopped posting videos my life would end
I love looking into the comments to find how game mechanics actually work
highscore 3525
Sean "jacksepticeye" m. Died on April 30th, 2019 from choking on a mint
in a fake intellectual voice 
‚ÄúActually Jack, you can have multiple cities on an island, which means you can have multiple city centers, since they are just the center of each individual cities.‚Äù
I slanders

Roses are red

Hey Jack pls do a warframe video
There are hidden troops in TABS
Lol i got a Coca-Cola adüòÖ
The beggining is like he is trying to be ASMR lol
"I want the easy version of the good things I already have." Well said, well said.
It seems like the president finally called Jack back for his EpIc gaming skills üòÇ
Hehhe the start off the video i already lauff
jack have you clicked the like button before even seeing the content
me yeah XD your com Brent is cheerful, happiness, good and funny
I stole the mint

But most importantly


He doesn't edit his pee break which is whacc
i actually did  like it before the vid started... but the thing is i never actually do that... how did he know???
There can be multiple citys
I always like videos before watching. If I don't like a video I will unlike.
Really struggling for those clickbait views huh?
Jack: I‚Äôm supposed to have a calm, relaxing time

Me: Yeah, when pigs fly
I like his videos so much, that I subscribed 3 times on my account.
Triangles have like 4 centers
The 'your breath is nasty' is so passive aggressive I love it
everybody needs a cug jug of PMA!
Nobody:
Jacksepticeye: Let's produce COCACOLA MINT!!!
what if it‚Äôs different towns on one island? Ireland is one island right? is Ireland one big town?
hence the multiple city centers
my guess anyway Idk
Hey jackseptceye I‚Äôm a huge fan üôÇ

hey jack this video is #33 on trending for gaming!
Another stupid clickbait thumbnail....Why man? WHY??? I'm done watching this channel, if I wanted to see my notification bar filled with clickbait titles and thumbnails I would've subscribed to Ali-A. Hopefully you revert back before its too late....Cya!
Who says I can't listen to lyrical music while doing my homework?
Jack it's an island, a city is a part of an island.... someone did correct you...
A nice and calm game.
intense screaming in the background
Ok... not so calm.
...That intro. That intro was something beautiful and made me chuckle. It's like you were introducing me to a whole new world. Although, if I weren't looking at the screen you'd actually sound like some sort of serpent character in a game about to give me an interesting, albeit odd, side quest.
I love watching this game there's something relaxing about it
THERE WAS A 67 JACK
MORE SATISFACTORY PLEASE
5:47 "Taking it (coke) after eating mints is no good" Well, you basically made a small scale "soda geyser" (aka "mentos and coke eruption") inside your own body (which causes the gas to be released out of the coke), so...yeah, it's not gonna feel good :P
Congrats on 22 mil jack
The intro btw
City center jack...  not island center... you can have multiple cities on an island
I want a Sans blanket lol
hushed sexy voice
Would u like a mint?

Jacksepticeye "Have you subbed yet?"
Me "no i did that like a year ago"
I think we all are just skipping through just to see him take the call XD
No I subbed 2 years ago
I shouldn't like the intro as much as I do. c'x
The beginning remind anyone of sexy Batman?
When he talks quiet it's actually soothing

Its a City center not center of the island
Hahaha sean guessed i had liked the video before i saw the content. Im a little suspicous now. like.. mindreader?

For once I'm actually in a blanket and nice and warm, and calm.

Yo can't wait of the next episode of VR SIM Vacation.
Scream at intro
Sean, please never grow up.
That's funny after Jack said, "Did you subscribe before this video?" I actually did. IDK I thought it was funny
You'll get sponsored soon jack
A great way to get a massive amount of points is if you separate the mansions and the houses creating a sort of upper/lower class system
The clickbait is so dissatisfying that it irritates me a bit..
Congrats for trending
Who else actually clicked like before the video started?
Funny how the thumbnail has nothing to do with the video and just a 4 second clip that meant nothing... cough* click bait
Please do more jack I would love to see more of this
Jack... what tf is a precipus
Can we all take a moment to appreciate Jack's little pony tail?
What is this intro?
Who else literally punches the like button?
"Oh, you dog's undercarriage!"
That voice crack at 39:12 to 39:13 made me crack as well. Literally.
Dibs on "Dog's Undercarriage" for a band name.

That sexy voice at the beginning though
Watership down reference? Has sean even seen that movie?
Does anybody else remember when he had to go to the bathroom and he forgot to edit it out? üòÇ
Jack, I suggest you play AC Odyssey
Seems like a pretty  fun game to play - unfortunately it's rather boring to watch imho.
5:57 how did he know
I was literally wrapped up in blankets
Actually, a triangle has multiple centers
At 5:39  lol I am in a blanket
Jack really called me out in the beginning... geeez. "Liking the video before you even see the content"
0:44 yeah, Pepsi‚Äôs better
Real background
was it not 35 hundred
Didn't like the mint coke... R.I.P possible coke sponsorship.
Is it just me or is Jack getting weirder and weirder üò∂ü§∑
Press my face
this game is basically a ripoff of Godus ...anyone remember that?
He said my name!!!
Jack, We NEED a Mint flavored Coke, NOW!

Also you keep me Positive when I‚Äôm feeling down,
So yes.  P M A
Shave ur beard and mustach
That mustache holy crap
keep going
Sup Jack.
sry about the message......yes, that was me......sry
it‚Äôs an island. so there can be many cities/ city centers on an island
you're doing something wrong with it.....
It's alright to have 4 city centers in one island. There's an island here, in the Philippines, that has 5 towns but there are like 7 or 8 volcanoes.
You can have an infinite amount of epicentres on the surface of a sphere. And technically if you consider the relation of said sphere to another object, any part of the sphere can be the "centre".

r/iamjustbullshitting
iam adiated to sam and colby vids
I SLANDERS YOU SLANDERS?
does he know that his previous best was 3525 and he celebrated to early

Well this happend to me during this video I was skipping though some bits to speed up the video and when I stopped all I heard was Oooo yaaasa and Jack rubbing his nipples. I didn't want to see that jack

Damn those ninjas abducting Jack to pee again.
I love you Jack
its simple if there is two city centers there is two cities
There are three centers in a triangle. Learned it in geometry
What is the point of this game?
I can't really watch any youtuber for longer than 30 min in a go. I usually take a break or do something else. 
But you Sean, you've something special ‚ô•Ô∏è
Jack tell us about your call,
Everyone SAYS we came for the call but in reality we all know we came for our boi, Shaun/Jack. Sorry if Shaun is spelt wrong.

Jack you can have 4 city centers how? you ask... - well you can have multiple cities on one island, you can have a center for each city that is around it,
Jack tip For You
Keep away from gold ore

Is it just me or did you make 7 more accounts and sub to jack with thoes 7 other accounts
I congratulations to you for 22 million üòÜ
WE ARE ALL ISLANDERS GOOD ONE JACKSEPTICEYE!, LOVE IT!
When he lost he could‚Äôve gotten only -10 but he passed over it too fast. Also on another island where he was placing a bunch of farms I think it was there was a 25 or 26 and he put it down for 18...
11:18 it was 45
Islanders
Islanders?
I landers





Is landers?
I love him
Your mom will live happily and healthy...





Like to make it true!
(Only mom-lovers people can like this)
If you treat the island as a small country, or state, having multiple city centres makes sense. You just have several cities in one mass of land üòéüëâüëâ science!
Haha it wasn‚Äôt edited out lol

Now that doesn‚Äôt seem like anything untill you say it
You have to keep building stuff until you can‚Äôt, then when you can‚Äôt place anything move to the next island for maximum points.
Lol we have many town center where I  town is divided into multiple parts but it‚Äôs all under the same name.
Jack! Keep adding to your island as much as you can before moving onto the next so you can get as many points as possible before moving on and starting fresh!
What happend to satisfactory

The asmr
Masons make bricks
Today‚Äôs session of ASMR. We have JACKSEPTICEYE SCREAMING INTO THE CAMERA ABOUT COKE A COLA ANS MINTS!!!
Actually, the island can have many cities so each city center would be the center of a city there for being a city center. Actually. :)

Sean called us out on our addiction
Hey uh... Jack a boy? Dont take this the wrong way. But you sounded like my father at the start... he is 48
0:55
I feel so attacked right now
Do you play ROBLOX
Bonercast
perfecto pertronam üòÅparry hotter
12:33
Jack. What are your headphones?! Ive been asking for a few videos now!
Sorry to be the one Jack but there can be different cities on an island.
When ur right ur right but when ur wrong ur sean
37:42 Is that Trump i hear?
Yes another video!
Allow me to fix the saying of " Island " 
Is - land
Not Eye - land
1:18 jack it does matter you matter
You know, you don't have to use every single item that you get... LOL And it's the center of the city not the center of the island. LOL
3:44 watch his mouth
This whole video looks planned lol
Jack still watch your videos and have been watching since 2013
Is it just me or does jack sound like that green alien from "Final Space"??? 0:01
Well jack it says city centres not island centres
You can have multiple town centers if you have multiple towns sooooo???
You could have a centre of a centre of a centre of a centre of a centre ...:)
Jacksepticeye is my favorite YouTuber because he has such a good attitude about everything and always seems happy in his videos! Keep up the fantastic work! üëç üòÅ
38:32
Here is the phone call 35:07
Make septic juice.
Jack: excited about the big yellow numbers while absolutely ignoring the plethora of small red ones.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY ALTHOUGH I'M LATE AF TO A LOT OF PEEPS
I'm at a point in my life in which I always click like on all of the jacksepticeye videos because I know they will always entertain me.
can you play hover?
Before you move on to a new island place your buildings, you keep there score if there placed but lose them if they arent placed. For example, watch you placement bar at 31:58 until the next island.
I don't see why jack named the video after that it lasted about 4 seconds wasn't nothing  interesting in a way it was clickbait
Towards the amount of city centers. With the size of the island and the size of what the people would be  it probably be multiple cities
Pretty sure if you died live on camera Robin would still upload it ;)
Is landers
I have jack I have
jack please give back top of the morning to ya ladies
I see Jack put these buildings down and all I think about is, how are these people supposed to get into their homes and buildings if Jack covers the entrance...with other buildings?? lmao
If you prefer oasis and not blur we can‚Äôt be friends
Jack is gay at 0:25... confirmed
No its pronounced...ISlanders not ilanders damn...(edit: btw Jack er Sean posted at 12 am in the Philippines boi)
You're lucky I'm feeling good this week even though the week feels like it's Sh---ing all around me. My mom and sis did my hair. Me and my nephew made a pie spent time together. I haven't gotten used to changing gender or name for my nephew. (tg) But I'm getting there. He's been 1 gender for 16 yrs. and now's the time to change it. By the way Jack that's a cute bunny face.Big red eyes little puff brown cheeks some funked up thing covering it's ears. And a tiny red nose. :   )
6:58 is that a ponny tail on the back of jacks head like if you see it
If you dislike you are a haters
Hey Jack, you can get more points by cramming things on each island until you can't anymore before you move on. Think of the next island button like a safety blanket for when you run out of things to build.
Things you think doesn't matter like why you are playing the game again really matters for us!
35:05
00:00 skylanders
I am wrapped up in  my blanket..... how did he know...???
28:45 I actually had a mint that second because I got free mint at a blood donation xD
You should play tomb raider jack
jack is so different from when he started YouTube, back in 2012-2013 he had short short hair and had a little stubble but now look at 'em. He has long-ish black hair and a BOOTYful beard. Who has been following since 2013! ‚úå I know I have and I can't stop Love ya Jackie! ( I know your name is Sean but I didn't know if I was spelling it right so sorry!)

I wish Jack didn't use click bait i just want to know what games he's playing in the title :(
36:07-36:11 why is no one bringing this up aghhh.
If you have three little towns, they all can have a centre
I am done
Well, why the hell would mint go good with coca cola? Like DUH Jack. Sometimes I don't understand you LOL!
Like if you agree>
Stop saying my name Jack lol I don't want to know your pregnant
Play forager
u can have endless centers
Do other people actually do that? (Like the vid before watching it) I just do it because I have a habit of watching half a video and then getting distracted and never finish it and like it
Mint coke wouldent work because it would explode on open? Are you okay jack, do you need to talk.
67
you can have 3 town centers if you have 3 towns. even if those towns are interconnected
hit man
Jack you should play mortal kombat 11 there is something for kano called Jack's epic eye "hint" "hint"
I drink only Pepsi. Do I have to unsubscribe
35:05
WHERE IS THE COCA COLA SPONSERSHIP ????!!!!!??!?!?!?!!?
Have you seen Equilinox? It‚Äôs like this but with animals! It can get complicated if not managed well. The dev is really cool and has made updates! It‚Äôs one of my favorite games now~
less than 4 minutes in and he could have died
You probably will skip this and pay it no mind.... but It‚Äôs your place in the world; it‚Äôs your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live.. Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence. The extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning. Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right. I'm just a small Youtuber that one day wants to be great on Youtube.. I'm not asking for anything but i would love for ANY support... ANY. Thanks for readingüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
Islanders? Do you mean Irelanders!!!!
What was the call about?
What Jack said your brain is in the future and your mouth hands feet anything that moves in your body is 80 milliseconds late
Jack pls play goat simulater again plss.. jack!,
Yay! More Jacksepticeye!üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüëçü•∞
Da intro tho...
Guys we all know its the President
I did
Jack has Punch the air too much his shoulder falling out of place that's why he has to hold it now. He can't handle the bosses anymore
35:08 you‚Äôre welcome
Jack, 2016 called.  They want their man bun back.  üòÇ
I know you don't do reactions that often but YOU NEED TO REACT TO THE SONIC MOVIE TRAILER!!! I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT!!!!!
EPIC
24:59 - 25:15 just close your eyes and listen....like if u get if
The pee break was more interesting than the call, so this video should be called: "I HAD TO TAKE A PEE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME!"
00:50 hes become self aware
loved it
If I had a dollar for every time I made the same joke as Sean, at the same time as him or before, I'd be rich. 

I love finding people with the same humor ‚ù§Ô∏è
i miss when the TOP OF THE MORNINGs were at the first seconds of the episodes
Had you see the Sonic movie TRAILER Yet?
Play jet island
Play green hell
Is this gsme free
Lol 11st 40 seconds
Spheres. Centers.
I don't know if anyway to contact Jack, but I think his newest video will be a good idea, there's an Easter egg in the game, Mortal Kombat 11 kano has an attachment called Jack's epic, which is a direct reference to Jack septic eye, I think that's amazing and I hope Jack somehow finds out.
Its a TOWN center not an ISLAND center
0:00
Who else clicked fast asf ‚ù§




Btw can i get a new subbb.
Not COKA COLA
They are town/city centers, you can have multiple towns in your island. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúisland centers‚Äù lol.
Has anyone else read watership down
Jack, stay on an island after you unlock the next. You can stay there until you can no longer place things and the go to the other island. I play this game and I've gotten to like 20,000 on the 5th Island
Only true jacksepticeye fans can like this...
üëá.     (Donating a 1$ to every ≈õub promise)

TABS

Stop freely advertising coke because if u keep doing their work for them their not going to sponsor you

Wait I‚Äôm not wrapped up in blankets. I should do that then continue watching in my little blanket cocoon.
TABS
Is it the president?
Wha? Jack? Saying you were talking too loud for a calm game? You've changed! The old Jack wouldn't have cared about how loud he was no matter what! What happened Jack? Who hurt you????
Sims. 4
I have an idea, if you use all the structures needed to get more structures than you can save structures for emergencies only aka spare structures
What if the call was about..... HIS COKE SPONSORSHIP! YOU'VE DONE IT JACKIE BOI!
that was the best intro i have EVER seen and i am absolutely not kidding. thank you for your contribution to the arts, sean.
Sean, you should try some ASMR reading!
OMG I STARTED TO CRY FOR TE INTRO!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I miss his intro :(
10/10 best intro ever
you should look at what the main thing in a pack is good with and its highest number and add things that help it in that area
Who else sang ‚ÄúI believe in you‚Äù when jack sang ‚Äúevery now and then‚Äù üòä
Actually Jack, you live on an island with many city centers

Sean, sweetheart. City center = city. So if you have multiple city centers what do you get? Multiple cities. Lol 8D

Can you play fade to silence
Imagine what would have happened if that mint had been a Mentos...
Top of the... morning to ya laddies
So on this game you are building your own little Village on a island. Cool
I thought he said Skylanders at first, also Ireland is an island with lots of cities and lots of centers for them
actually, your thoughts even are in the past, everything to see and know is in the past by a small amount due to the limits of the universe
35:34 thats what she said and how she said it
Why don‚Äôt you play a lot of games any more
i`m at the hospital right now wrapped up in blankets i'm happy you mentioned that the hospitals called Presbyterian if you've ever heard of it you probably wont respond but oh well i was moved here from Guthrie if you ever heard of it via plane i'm 14 i usually live with my dad in corning but hes at home my moms here shes asleep any way she usually lives in the middle of nowhere with my twin brothers who are nine and they're named lucas and skyler and my cousins named megan and kollyn sometimes when i visit i share a room with her megan i mean also i guess a kid named dakota lives there because mom got custody because he was abused by his dad i guess that's it i've been watching you my whole life i guess i cant wait till you upload again.
Wait, if the video never got uploaded, then we wouldn't know if he's alive or dead!

It's Schrodinger's Jack!
Your important call was coke

Jack you can have more than one city center if you have more than one city.
22mil prayers
Congrats on reaching 22mil lad
:)  I have a jacksepticeye video addiction, first thing I do when I can get on a computer is see what's new...  High score  3525, go for it Jack!  Become #1.  ;P   But really I watch your videos because how entertaining you are, between watching someone say nothing and winning all the time, or you, I'd pick you every time!  :)  Play what you enjoy.

Me: but.... jack....... you forgot the most important part. Fifty-three hundred sixty-nine
I started the video with my volume on full blast, I feel weirdly uncomfortable and seduced at the same time HAHA
Omg I haven't watched hack in soooo long
I thought he said he learned how to play. YEt he is still just going for max points with each placement, rather than thinking ahead long term.
merch link? idk if there is one
Hi jack will you possibly play world war z
haha the minute he started saying "I-Landers" I got into a giggle fit that I could not stop.
Its sounds like he said "I land her you land her"
Jack can you go back and forth with satisfactory and islander
Undertale pee break part 2
Why does Sean always refer to him self as jack
You love your shaman i like my raman
Hey bro
Well actually Jack, you can't have 3 centers on an indivial object, but in a group you can have multiple centers. This is because each individual object in said group has its own center. The center of the group, and the center of each individual object in that group, multiple centers. It's mostly a technicality. Also, every physical object in existence has at least 2 centers. Center of mass and center of gravity.
How did he know
14:24 i heard that sound through my headset as well. it seemed like something horrible was about to happen.
When english trys to speak to a german 

English: can i tounch that over there.
German: Nine.
English:what do you mean nine.
German: NINE. NINE.
english. Stop yelling and what does nine have to do with this?
German: 
My dad worked for coke cola for 20 years
Aoe joke

Are you going to play satisfactory again?
Tabs
Im watching it that is published yesterday. Who did?
I haven‚Äôt watched jack in a while because I got board of his content (conveniently I got bored when he got bored of his own content too) but I saw the first episode of this series and it seems that since I‚Äôve been gone that jack snorted 16 lines of cocaine and then took muscle relaxers. I‚Äôm really enjoying the content now because sometimes he‚Äôs chill and then he‚Äôs on cocaine again. That‚Äôs the jack I missed when I stopped watching. (keep in mind I don‚Äôt know long it‚Äôs been like this)
0:53 owww tank you jackaboy
Just was watching and I was happy then I see the man bun........ I em now unsubscribed
who else just wanted to see the impotent call so just checked the comments
Mabey
Pls play mortal Kombat 11
Always like before seeing content
City Center = Center of city.

A single island can have multiple cities and thus multiple city centers.
Jack I would really like to see more Vacation Simulator.
Where you friends with my nrother brandon? Or was he just chearing me up

It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôve developed a food allergy or ibs. I developed ibs when I got into my 20s. Or it could be a stomach bug. 

Anyway feel better Sean!!!!! Take it easy!!
The music at the beginning is from the game Child of Light :) It's called Aurora's Theme. 
It's a beautiful game ^^

Congrats Jack.... The Gaelic Gladiator strikes again!!!üòÅüòÅ
While watching this (finished) livestream, I am busy with a project I am excited for making :3
Can't wait to finish this, and the whole video gave me energy :D
I just wanted to say thank you for doing all this while feeling down. Don't feel disappointed in yourself, because it had to be two parts. You are making a difference, Jack. Don't expect to much of you. It is ok to put your health and sleep first. You are great and you know it.


Also: Thank you to all the other donors! It amazes me every time how generous people can be. Every bit helps. We are making the world a better place.
Sean your absolute angel! You did an amazing job helping people yet again! And congrats on the 22 million! Now go and some rest you deserve it<3
Trial and error food triggers are a pain in the ass. You might have the flu.
I go through the same BS on the daily. I was out shopping yesterday and felt fine until I was almost home. My dad thinks I touched a surface someone (who had handled a food I cannot) touched and forgot to wash my hands, touched my mouth and licked my lips.
Hopefully this won't be your problem, Sean. Best of luck sorting it out.
congratulations on 22mil
Anti is my favorite ego along with chase Brody and Marvin the magnificent but congrats dude pma for life

Hey just an idea, but for each month could you give us an update/info on what the charities are doing/have done with the money we raised the month before? I think it'd be cool to help motivate people and be good to see the impact these charity streams actually on the real people the charity helps.

IDK, but any charities I've supported long term I've loved seeing how my money has helped eg. Guide dogs keep you updated on a puppy they're training.
you are a great person I hope you are doing well and you are awesome for getting charity to help the kids you are so kind take care sean.

Wish I could have donated, but my parents wouldn't let me. The problems with being too young to do anything. But, I would have voted for chase on the poll. Poor sad dad. Keep being true to yourself Sean! (Or Jack, whichever you prefer) You deserve every last subscriber and then some. Love you, you bring me joy even when I don't think that's possible.

Wow another boring video , two boring video . You getting stale and out of idea
I understand your streams are for the good and they have alot of effect, but they are soo boring. Actually do something for your livestreams like play a game, reenact some sort of skits, do a lame ass memestream. Something other than just you sitting there doing nothing
b u t   t h a t   c u t   o f f   t h o
22 mil wooo
OwO
Jack please bring back the old intro 
Wapush
"Top of the morning to yall ladies my name Jacksepticeye and welcom to"

I wasted my time. -_-
My dogs birthday was 2 weeks ago and we spent $125 dollars on treats and toys and last year we even got her a friend but yesterday she died it was her 15 birthday and she had the time of her life a day before she died and I really need support right now. 1 like = 1 support please like this comment it really means a lot to me and god blees you all
Hey, Sean, could you consider doing a charity stream for adult or childhood cancer? My dad has cancer and it would mean a lot to me if you raised money for a cancer charity. ‚ô•Ô∏è
What is pam
In his first akinator video he had less than 1 million subscribers. He said something said in 5 years he'd have 1 million. Little did they know he has 22 million 5 years later. Congratulations Jacksepticeye!

Jesus Christ, some of you fans are rude as shit. All you seem to care about is his looks. His hair? Yeah it's going grey, so what? He's almost 30 and some people grey faster than other people. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it and it doesn't mean that you need to bring it up. It's hair. It doesn't diminish who he is as a person. This fanbase has gotten so bad.
Please don't ban me but I ship septiplier but not SMEXUAL kind
Is Jack going grey!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Go back to the young jack plz shave and dye your hair brown
