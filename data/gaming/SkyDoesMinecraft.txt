Can y'all stop telling the man what "you want" let him do what he likes and what makes him happy and if you're going to ask do it nicely don't make it sound like a demand it's a request at the end of the day
its good to see that ur back keep it up.

I want Adam to Join SMP Live.
Use schlatt coins to get a ride to the end portal
Join SMP live with callmecarson
Hi sky love your videos do you plan on making any more music my favorite was la light
I really like how sky sounds like a real person and not some overhyped cracked out kid's youtuber also SKY STREAM ON TWITCH
Watching Adam slowly learn more tricks and tips about current day Minecraft from ant is a refreshing pace from rampant mini games.
JSchlatt is crying
I can‚Äôt believe that sky would play with Hank Venom, the same man that likes stall. 
[Jshlatt disliked that]
Sky: breaks wood with a pickaxe
Me: heavy breathing
The phantom has been broken for a while, Ant

I really want a minecraft cape.
Who's watching this after Sky came back?!





Trick Question: Everyone Is.
Me: Finds enderportal

Also me: we are in the endgame now
Good old Sky back to the old grindüëç

Wow . Only 3 to defeat the ender dragon 
 Ant is a god player
It's good to see Sky back, especially his intro.
I thank Adam doesn't know that 2 people can be in a boat
The begginning of the vid...
(Why's Ant laughing at a Skeleton?) Sky looks up What's tha- oh, it's a Phantom, what's it doing? Ant insults the Phantom It's not meant to do that XD


,  Good one game XD
47:18 AntVenom a cheater xD look at the chat!
Sky I love your videos and I hope (and know) you will keep up the great work!
Sky should remake New World. It's the song that mainly started his singing career.
It's nice seeing you back and on your feet manüëç
"My singing voice just doesn't sound very good."
I hope this is a joke. Please someone make 2 hours of antvenom singing

Also I've been a fan sense team crafted and have always made me laugh. I believe I was 8 or 7 when I started to watch you. I'm 15 now soo keep up the good work.

Hey Adam you felling ok?
You don‚Äôt have to do Minecraft if you don‚Äôt want to.
Just do whatever just know I‚Äôll support you no matter what. 
Please feel better and do the content you wanna do.
Sky should join HERMITCRAFT , i would watch him react to all the builds and talking to mumbo jumbo or other hermits.
This vid snuck into my recommended
I'm very happy rn
YOU SUBSCRIBED TO SHENPAI!?!?!?!?
This video triggered a part of my memory that I had completely forgotten about.
Sky seemed genuinely happy at the dolphin part and I swear my heart almost burst
Glad to see the oldest game getting back together but sky if u or anyone is reading this 
We miss Ross
We miss barney
We miss max
We miss red
We miss aphmau 
We miss Ross (I know I already said Ross but god damn it I miss him)
We miss the whole gang
Please try and record with them because they are amazing people.
Sky not to be that guy but wait before hits, if u spam ur going to waste ur sword and not do that much dmg,like so he can see
Skyyyyyy please can you do more mod showcases, also, miss butter, im super glad youre back though, thank you
I was 11 when I first watched your mod showcases. I'm 17 now and I'm glad you're back to doing what you love to do
Please, MUCH more talking, people loved your personality.
They should do a battle dome vid
The Old Magics
Your doing really good. Keep it up!
Episode 3 and they already have Iron and Diamond Things XD
That music brings so much Nostalgia
They sound so calm, it's actually really comfortable to watch as a play Xenoverse 2... please bring back Xenoverse 2...
Ant u really gotta teach this man how to use a sword üòÇ
not a fan of this being uploaded by the time 1.14.1 came out and they've said 1.14 isn't even out yet at the time they've recorded
I really hope they find one of the new villages I'd like to see sky/Adam's reaction to it
Dude im as clue less as sky when he is playing!! Damn Minecraft change so much
Bring back teacher!!!!!!
ok, is it just me, or sky voice is like he's dead inside, or did he lose his voice? and the only time I heard him sound normal, is when he said something about a CHICKEN.
Dragron thats epic
I miss cops and robbers Oof.  :c
I‚Äôm somehow subscribed but have not ever got a new video in my sub box
u should bring back mod showcases :)
I got a challenge for you for do not laugh and you slapping Ross in real life
This series is neat.


'Nough said.
Man how I missed sky does Minecraft back in the days. I only watched him all these years ü§ó
Why didn‚Äôt you get the emerald
Sky has to watch jschlatt Minecraft parody tier list
Ask to be in the SMP LIVE server
47:10 ant said he found two ender pearl......yet it said [gave 2 ender pearl to antvenom]  LOL
Well there's 1.14.1 now, so it's no longer the latest version
17:54 when sky threw away the iron sword i killed me because if you put an iron sword in a crafting table along with another iron sword it heals it
Can you unprivate your gta videos
Sky I have been subscriber since 100000000 plz bring back try not to laugh with Barney and all the good ol crew
Ok so if you want extra help here you go 
.
.
Your gonna want to grind ores till you have a good supply of iron, gold and diamonds then your gonna wanna prep for your best option if you were gonna die a lot of times so first set of armour should be a mix of enchanted iron and diamond, a strong bow will be good for ranged attacks and finally potions and golden or notch apples
So YouTube messed up and now I am subed to channels I had unsubed before but I am keeping Sky
Thank you sky thank you so much you cure my depression
I just FOUND two enderpearls.  Ok Ant
When I found out that you were back to playing video games I damn near pissed my pants
Carson should add Sky on smplive
You should get a public discord server up
Jchlat intensifies *
Really enjoying this...Keep it up sky and ant!!
I LOVE YOU SKY!!!üíïüíï
Before notification squad!
Adam I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre back
Need ?Ross Sloth
You need to join smplive with ant
23:08 Somehow I got a turtle stuck in my boat. I left my boat for a couple of minutes and came back to a turtle being in there lol. I can't punch it out either
Sky sound so discouraged from the game plus i thought he was done with minecraft
Adam's videos always bring a smile on my face everyday.
Dam ive lost my phones for a phew months and i come back and sky started minecraft again what a good day to be alive
Great video Adam!! been a fan for a while, can you increase the brightness for future videos so we can see in the dark with you?
I miss your gorgeous faceüò¢
You ok bro?u sound a little sad in this vid
guys know when carsons streaming?
Wait he still plays?
Please just contact all of team crafted and bring back my childhood for just one video ... I'm talking everybody .. do something because really nostalgic watching your stuff
Wow. They are great at this. It takes me like a month to find a end portal lol.
OMG ITS HANKVENOM!!
I want to see Sky in SMP Live
He's doing minecraft again??? I'm going to cryüò≠üò≠
wonder if he will ever go back to his old spaztic and loud self
Wow Hankvenom will help beat the enderdragon with Adam, but not jschlatt.
Sky seems different. He's not laughing really loud or screaming like he used to
I was playing minecraft earlier with my friend and a phantom got stuck on our house minecraft may be a bit drunk
You found the Stronghold way later than you were supposed to.
Good Job!
Sky stole jshlatt's role in deafeating the Ender dragon
I think I'm the 18th comment, so nice
Adam is either playing on a controller or a touch pad
"ender dragron"
Glad I found this guy again.
"Derp"...Haven't heard that in years...
OMG IT FRIBMING HANKVENOM
So how do you beat the ender dragon?
Commenters that is 




My way is to get invis potions so endermen wont attack me
A efficiency 4 or 5 diamond pickaxe to mine endstone at the end to climb the towers
A potion of regeneration 2 just incase i run out of golden carrots/golden apples
A power 5 infinity 1 bow 
A sharpness 1-5 diamond sword
A full set of enchanted diamond armor
A bed outside the stronghold
A map in item frame incase i die and my bed was obliterated for sum reason
Strength 2 potion 
Speed potion (longer)
A  enderpearls
Enderchest incase i run out of regen potions and golden carrots/apples
Glass bottles to get dragon breaths so the purple thing wont damage me 
And then just stay at an obsidian tower and start snipin the dragon 
If it shoots the purple things just use the glass bottles to either reduce the duration or completely remove it so it wont damage yu
A shield for a reason that i forgoten
Andd i think thats it
DERP PHANTOMS ARE IN LEUGE WITH THE DERPY SQUIDS
It always seems like sky is high when he records lol
"Dragron"
You left me hanging üò¢
Jschlatt is apparently bipolar
YES the Adam i know is BACK!!!!!!!
WHEN ADAM SAID HE WAY BAD AT MC I ALMOST LOST IT BRO YOURE A MINECRAFT VETERAN
RIP blacksmith
Composed
Yeah depression does that
PLAY SMPLIVE W/ CALL ME CARSON
OK how did you get all the ender pearls?
Only og‚Äôs remember escape the jail
This boi so high
Hey sky! You should play Warframe! A very great mmorpg one that you dont want to miss out on and would make for a very fun playthrough should you find nothing for minecraft content!
Hey sky guess what my favorite cartoon invader zim is going to have a movie this summer on Netflix if I see it I'll be harder better faster and stronger puts my arrow head tail blade against sky's neck you wouldn't be able to defeat me with my power at maximum HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA plays omega flowey's theme
Do you still like BUUUUTTEEEERRR ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
An intro an intro my kingdom for a intro
Love u sky!!
U guys are in the endgame nowüòâ
Phantoms should be attacking at night
Going to try to be a bit more energetic? Am I missing something?
When I type sky does in YouTube, it's not everything, it's Minecraft.
we need the ol' crew back together
Sky is playing with hankvenom
Sky join the smp live
Ant to Sky: You smart, you loyal, I appreciate you
Yes im gonna cryüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
aw he didn't put his sound  up for the new end portal sound
Dude his intro hasnt changed at all
God I missed that intro
And first like Sherlock
>Nostalgia intensifies
Did you cheatüòÜ? Lol
I thought he gave up minecraft??
I missed you Sky!!!!
He sounds so depressed of the 4 years of this game
Its been so long ü§ó
Phantoms are only nighttime mobs in Minecraft
I loved it when he's so loyal in minecraft and never change to other games... Not like the others.
"dragron"
Being me minecraft parkour u thumb
You guys deserve to be in hermitcraft
At first, I was confused as to why they were so monotone but then I realized it's realistic. Normally when playing a calm game like this it isn't endless screaming. We forgot this due to be constantly exposed to  theatrics of YouTube.
Adam r u enjoying this - just making sure
I stayed up till 1AM on a school night to watch this all the way through. These videos bring back serious nostalgia of the 2014 days even though you guys are playing in 1.14.
#SkyArmyForever
sky is definitely not ok you can just hear it in his voice
You guys who are new have no idea how sad i was when Adam first did his feelings video. I was here when he did his first roommates video. So Around 3 or 4 years ago, and i will always be here.
I refuse to watch any other minecraft videos
I want Adam to join smp live
Always glad to see a new episode with you and Ant.
I think Adam is unhappy with what he is doing... he dosent sound the same, I love Adam doing minecraft. But I like his well being better
He really loves those wooden pickaxe
is adam using a trackball mouse?
what is the seed of their minecraft world their using?
Jschlatt has left the chat
Please start swearing again the Minecraft community is older now and I think you could start swearing again
Welcome back my dude
phantoms are scary, especially when you go back after mining and like 5 phantoms are circling you.
YOU ARE BACK YAY IMA CRY
Join SMP Live
Who remeber ross
Sky sounds so bored
Continue on maze runner plz
Only 90 kids remember do not laugh with ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSS
Wait, he still does Minecraft?
Youre able to change the texture back to the original
It‚Äôs crazy coming back and seeing this again after the last time you were making content was like... years ago when i was way younger, talk about a blast to the past and the flood of memories..
Episode 3!?
24:24 I diagnose you with Logdotzip
My favorite series !
That‚Äôs unfortunate seeing as 1.14.1 was updated today..
Oh my gosh I grew up watching skydoesminecraft and just now I are subscribed and shed some tears of joy to see him posting Minecraft videos

Sky- defeats ender dragon and pulls a sasuke then loses in 3 seconds
You sound so dead inside good lord-
Jeff.
Subzeroxtabyte remember the fallen
YAYYY NEW VIDEO
ADAM, PLEASE PLAY WITH CALLMECARSON
Adam needs to make a collab with Carson
Schlatt feels betrayed.
Sky, do what you love. Don't let someone who tattoos his name on himself walk all over you. Be you. We love you for you and always will
New ender dragon is kinda annoying, he hit me with the charge (why is the hit box 1 block past his wingspan!?!) and made a 90 degree turn and pulled up- lobbing me off the edge. Was too late by the time I scrolled to the ender pearls to recover as I didn't expect it.
Adam should do SMP live
Where the mods showcases at thoo??
Why do you sound so depressed in the beginning my man, be HAPPY. ;-;
hank venom be like
Does he know about igloos and polar bears?
I hope sky do a video of  do not laugh :)

Adam are you alright? You don't sound too well in this video health-wise

Sky for new SMPlive member
Yo you should play with callmecarson

Ant, please tell him to not waste his diamond pick on wood...
My hero is back!
I love this
Note: Like any other mob, during the day, Phantoms try to find shade but since they're in the sky they can't so they end up flying around your general area without attacking you until they die.
This better be a resuscitation to minecraft
This awesome thanks sky
My chest hairs are satisfied
Tell hankvenom hello

Low key when Adam has been playing Minecraft. He seems like he wants to die. Tell me if I'm wrong?
Please play Minecraft murder ü§ó.                üî™

25:53 Hankvenom got the green-top
make a bow
This is honestly hard to watch because the change of Adams voice compared to way back when makes me so sad... He‚Äôs been though so much and if you‚Äôre reading this Adam, I hope you can be happy or as joyous as you could be in life as you were before.. Love you lots
im so happy watching your minecraft videos... without them... the 'youtube' part of my childhood is incomplete

Sky : What the F--... What the heck?
Hi
Sky my friend got hardcore friendzoned what should he do
Lit
My favorite Minecraft YouTubers do a colab? Am I in heaven?
Nigward
Haven‚Äôt watched you for a while, like Sky‚Äôs new voice, you should try being a voice actor for videogames, it‚Äôs wonderfully deep and generic(which is a good thing at times).

You should try intentionally deepen your voice a bit more, it‚Äôll sound heavenly
What ever happened to the roommates series

Or the pirates series ?
Schlatt be jelly
Is it just me or does sky sound dead inside recently? Like he sounds uber depressed.
I am a big fan of sky and always will watch him
ive been a long time watcher and i just wanted to say i love your videos so much
Adam, pal, you dont have to play this if you dont want to
Bro y are you sounding so down if you don‚Äôt want to do Minecraft don‚Äôt do it
Ok
Thank you for counting Minecraft Adam your awesome and we all think you are amazing
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooooooooooooo tttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooooooo skkkkkkkkkkkkkkyyyyyyyyyyydooooooooooooo
Minecraft Parody of a NetNobody song?
Sky my dad said when he was working out one the gym shone came on (no joke) just thought I should let you know your music is a success
Lol it‚Äôs annoying how antvenom has to justify everything he does, just cheat lmao we don‚Äôt care
I got 2 questions for anyone: 

1) what's a good minecraft mod pack
2) why is sky's minecraft look different mainly his menu screen from ep.1
Just realised how glitchy the game isüòÇüòÇ
Like he mined four lapis and got 26 of themüòÇüòÇ
Wow
Bruh
1st 500
Sky sounds dead asf
Dolphins can't breath underwater
Hey Adam I know you get these types of comments a lot but thank you for changing my life, you made me want to make youtube content,  you helped me relax when I was upset or stressed, you showed me the how important true friendships are and you truly positively changed my life as a child, so as a now 19 year old "adult", thank you.
Hey Sky! Been awhile since I‚Äôve seen you round! But um..I was wondering if you would ever play a do not laugh with Max,Ross,Red,and Barney every again..if not that‚Äôs perfectly fine I understand!!anyway Live ya sky! GO SKYARMY!!!
One of the rare minecrafters who hasn‚Äôt gone to the Fortnite side
Wholeikmeincrafffff?!
hi
What the crap it happened again
Will you ever play with Ross again
Why does sky sound depressed that makes me not wanna watch him sad playing this game remember sky you don't have to play this for us
Peasants!! How dare you not use butter armor and tools!!!
When I was a young child, I use to watch Sky everyday on my moms laptop whenever I get back home from school. I have matured (probably) now and I no longer enjoy Minecraft videos. Glad to see you coming back from your tough life.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU STILL MADE
 MINECRAFT VIDEOS
The one dislike is the phantom that died during intro
1000 views in 5 minutes.
Dang
Its like a baby
I'd say you are still very good at this game it's just so much has changed since you played last and what ever fields you have degraded in will be picked up fast.
HANKVENOM
a
nice
Why does he only have 400 likes????
GIVE HIM MORE LIKES mostly to show support and love
.
Wow sky
is this reuploaded and if not im very happy he started making content again
im confused just got here is this sky like right now or just re uploading episodes.
I‚Äôm glad some of the OG friends are back. Most of em are either in prison or registered sex offenders
We can tell you dont enjoy playing this.
He lost his humor and he was more funny
Adam, you don‚Äôt seem the same man.
Hankvenom
Yo Sky please don't go down that road because I've seen so many YouTubers with 10 million Subs which is basically you and i see them with 400k views and then like oh my God they have died please don't become that one of them please be like more hype or something get our attention and just in general be fun you know not to be rude but it seems like you're heading down that road and I don't want you to be there
I enjoy the awesome series
It saddens me that adam isnt as hype or as loud as before
How‚Äôs your son?
Sky's back!

is it me or did sky lost his sense of enthusiasm in this
I AM CRYING TEARS OF JOYüò≠üò≠ SKY IS BACKKKKKK PLAYING MINECRAFT. ASSEMBLE TEAM CRAFTED AGAIN!!!!
Adam... I may not be in the right place to say this, but you don't sound happy. Please don't quit on your dreams. Don't quit on yourself. You tried music, it wasn't bad. Try again, you'll do better. Keep trying. You sound so unenthusiastic. This video is lazy. The editing is lazy. This video is almost 50 minutes long. Why? I started watching you in 2013. You were happy then, enthusiastic, excited. Six years later... you're depressed. You're bored. Please, do not stop chasing your dreams. Your real dreams. Take a break, work on music. Work on what you want to. Get a job, whatever position, in the career field you want to see yourself at the top of. Even if you see this, I understand that you may not respond. That's fine. Please just consider what I''m saying. I want to see you successful. YOU were my childhood inspiration, and I've worked so hard to be successful in my own life. Yet you don't inspire me anymore. Change that. 


with love, 
beef man
Are u copying Max(mithzan)ü§îüò°üò†ü§¨
Me when sky breaks the wood with a picaxe [TRIGGERED]
CAn i ask why the quality is so much more terrible than before?

Minecraft: is dying on the YouTube platform


Adam: hold my butter
yew my drug is back








Kids dont do drugs, but I missed the videos so I had to :D
WOOOOOO SKY IS BACKKKKKK
This reminds me of the era of minecraft in YouTube
The one that involves everyone improving their base.
That era always seemed satisfying. Just watching this island grow is cool.
Remember when everyone had those sick ‚Äúbutter‚Äù backpacks in like 4th grade. God those where good times.
I love you sky love your videos and i love your personality
Thank you for taking me back to when I was younger watching your Minecraft  videos, big nostalgia trip. Welcome back recruits.
My heart goes whoosh when Adam talks
It‚Äôs the return of the king 
Adam comes back to minecraft
You where the best part of youtube 
And youve come back and easily took your spot back.
Im a senior in highschool and i remembered when i started watching sky as young as back in like middle school dude. Its honestly nice to come back to this üòÇ
I have his minecraft backpack with budder on it
Oh my god I miss sky‚Äôs videos, I used to watch them when I was like 6 and I‚Äôm 13 now
I love sky so much playing making our day the best and pushing through it‚Äôs so inspiring to have him to look up to
This right here......makes me feel genuinely good
I miss Ross 
üò¢
has vietnam flashbacks of sitting on my couch all day and watching this
You just need to scream at random times for no reason then these vids will be perfect
It‚Äôs a spooky world out there, where if you sing the Pok√©mon theme you could get copyright striked
Dude i miss u
And ssundee too he got addicted to fortnite its sp bad i want to die.
START DOING MOD REVIEWS AGAIN, you have the power to revive the modding community
Adam: "Oo 300!"
Marvel Fans: crying in the distance
your mic sounds like 2013-2014 mod review and team crafted sky
I feel bAd for sky to be honest compared to when he first played minecraft with Barney and bodil and stuffs like that he was so energetic now he seems depressed
Sky and fluffy 


This brings tears to my eyes
woah is Adam uploading videos everyday now?? NICE!
Anyone else been here since his first mod showcase
Jerome: this is the longest skyblock I've done 
Me:you did an 11 episode skyblock with mitch
I'm so glad you stuck with minecraft.
Not trying to lie but you need to be more positive. You're not laughing or making any jokes. I miss you man. Still tho keep up the work
I've missed ya, hope you're doing well friend üíïüíïüíï
Adam 2018: you want Minecraft well your not gonna get it

Adam I am so happy to see a fresh new Minecraft video again!
Hey Adam, hope you had fun making this video and playing the game, I hope you're doing ok. :)
I play Archon HQ's Skyblock at Genesis
SKY! Love that you have returned, but you have to change to 1.12.2 when playing on the skyblock server. That's why all the glass panes, fences and chests are separated.
I'm so glad Adam is back to 2014 Adam! it reminds me of drug run and stuff like that. it even sounds like Adam from 2014!!
They should try skyfactory 3 through twitch.
Omg i am so heckn happy you are back uwu
remember in team crafted  when Adam knew how to sprint
i love you vids iv been watching for 6 years
Love the videos can't wait for more netnobody
I want to see a new roleplay series

I had no idea that Sky returning to Minecraft was what I needed in life lol
Bring back Cops n Robbers ;-;
omg my childhood YES youre back aaaaaaaaaa. It's been over 5 years mate. since I was freakin 10
I've been watching you and been with you through everything for 5 years now I started watching you when I was 9 and I'm now 14
Your the last 2 team crafted who play minecraft keep it going
SKY I hope you can read this.

it's good to have you back because you're the best! but i have a question do you really want to do this? cuz from your recent videos you sound like you're tired or maybe sick
So glad this game and you are becoming relevant again. My childhood is being resurrected
its been many years that skydoesminecraft use that intro
Been here since jailbreaks and mod packs
Been watching since the first custom map
lol
What if this is an reupload
Love you videos as always, man!

I'm glad you're back playing minecraft again and having fun :> years of watching you back then feels so nostalgic now. Feels great. Thanks for your awesome content üíï
I swear any time I feel sad or lonely and I just pull up on the Sky's videos and I get cheered right up. Anyone else?
I miss Ross R.I.P the sky crew üòî

I was having a bad day till now thx sky
Oh I missed that intro
First
I‚Äôm so glad he took his spot back
Adam, I must warn you seasons 4 and 6 of the Arrow are really bad but season 3 and 5 are really good
Who came across a nostalgic Minecraft video so they decided to watch their fav minecrafters against?
Dear Sky, kindndly bind your run key to shift and crouch key to left control.
start a series on survival on rsmv.net again i miss those videos
Dang my childhood as returned...
Anyone else been here since sky‚Äôs first survival
The best part about sky returning after a long time is that all of the haters decided to leave! 3k likes and only 26 dislikes!
Just curious, is this a re-upload from before? O.o
Adam seems so depressed while playing but in just glad to see him back at it
This is some hella forced content
I love your minecraft videos and will you do a do not laugh video again
U still exist ? ... AHHHH NOSTALGIA ... So happyyyy

Wait, is this a old video or is this actually him now
Thank you so much for being back Minecraft, you were my childhood from like 8 years old to 13
THE MAN IS BACK PPL
I still remember the days of team crafted
I like how the majority of your viewers are probably like 15 now because they missed there childhood
He mentioned Arrow and The Flash yayyyyyy
Jerome needs to build a god betty
You basically raised me. I used to watch your videos everyday back when I was little. You used to be my favorite person, and you were actually my main inspiration in my childhood years. I'm now a teenager, but it's glad to see that you haven't changed much. Thanks for just being such a cool dude
I love Flash and Arrow
Do a mod review that will be perfect
Remember a time when you have eleven million subscribers they all got notifications when you post of how the times have changed
He just sang the Pok√©mon theme üò¢
Bring back DNL or somthing
Started watching adam in 2012 and still watching
RANDOM SCREAMS
Wait this guy is a thing again?
Can you make a server for mcpe
I need to get something off my chest.
When I was a kid I hated you and for a completely stupid reason.
I was salty that you called gold butter.
However, I still kept watching your videos despite this.
No matter all that, you were a part of my childhood and with the glasses of salt removed I am so so happy you're back.
ouch the intro hit me in my childhood
MORE DO NOT LAUGH AND GET BARNY , ROSS. OKWARD, JEROME AND DEADLOX!! LIKE SO HE CAN SEE

Sky you are the best YouTuber ever
The last time I watched your videos, I was like abt 10? Or 11 years old. For some reason, I just stopped watching because I got addicted to other games but then right now, I was just scrolling through my yt feed and found this video which really gave me the chills and a nostalgic feeling. For abt 6 years I havent heard about you guys and I'd be honest I missed yall and I really dont know but I really feel like getting back into my pc and play minecraft again

Just wanna share
Finally Jerome is first place
Wow i haven't seen a sky video in years, thank you youtube for recommending this to me.

You haven‚Äôt aged a day

I just found out you're back on the minecraft scene today, and oh my god I absolutely adore this! You were the first taste of minecraft I've ever gotten and were what allowed me to play it. Seeing you back on minecraft is bringing back so many fun memories. Watching you back on here is making me want to play Minecraft even more than I have been. Thanks for being my childhood man! I was here since 2013 until you left mc, but I'll be watching every single video of yours from now on once again!
This is still too nostalgic for me.

Sky Jerome and all the other of Minecraft players literally made YouTube
Adam, I know what you are going through. I had depression I tried to commit suicide 11 times, I cut, i did all the worst things. But I got through, thanks to you. If it were not for you I would still be trying to commit. Thank you and I will watch you too the end. Also my fav series ever is your try not to laugh series. You also should talk to Ross.

REEEEE

Mod reviews?
Do not laugh please
BRING BACK EPIC JUMP MAPS
I started watching you when I was 7 years old when you released the video of you saying you will never play Minecraft again it broke my heart and now I m just wondering on the internet and out concern I wanted to see your name again and now I see you making more Minecraft video s inside me I know it not the same.
change that fov foo
Man its weird to see this back, I just listened to the offical podcast with you a while back and it's kinda just jarring to see sky back after not watching for like 5 years
Yeet
I thought he didnt like this game anymore?
I remember Sky, he made me always thought that gold was actually butter because he used to phrase that, and whenever I had a buttered toast I got scared because I thought the butter would be hardened gold and if I bit it, my teeth would break lol.
Minecraft is actually getting popular again
Still doing minecraft, huh?
Wow new vid in 10 years
ADAM!!! STOP DA SPAMMIN!!! You gotta wait for your sword to raise back up, otherwise you will only deal half a heart to no hearts of damage. There is an option that shows the cool down in one of 3 places: under your cursor or on either side of your toolbar.
love usky
Why is sky like meh, this game is boring and not hyped at all like his friend
Why does sky sound like he wants to die
Heyo!
You really don‚Äôt seem like you want to be doing this. Don‚Äôt do it just because your fans want it. Be happy.
Nice
this guy thought he could do what joji did but took a fat L and a dip in views instead
Hey there person scrolling through the comments. Have a great day!
Yay!
Yes you're making Minecraft videos you can thank you Skye
11 million subs and so little few views, sucks to see a God to fall
Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who heard him mention that he has a gf rn. I really hope this is true because I hope he found someone nice and hopefully she‚Äôs not like...someone else....
Last time I watched SkyDoesMinecraft I was halfway through fifth grade. I don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm 16 now and a Junior in High School, Im gonna relive some nostalgia now :)
Hey adom i was watching old videos for nostalgia and wanted to check out sky vs gaming and i ask you can you please unblock all of the sky v gamming vids if not i understand please and thanks
The videos are highkey funnier with face cam
Everyone is too caught up in their own needs ‚ÄúOMG MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK‚Äù. People really can‚Äôt see that Adam doesn‚Äôt want to be here? He sounds so depressed. He should be doing what he loves, not playing MC because his 10 year old fans want him to.
Yay
Sky...we need to talk I looked at your subscriptions and do you know what I saw t series wanna know what I didn‚Äôt see...PEWDIEPIE WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYY pls don‚Äôt leave hate just joke
Um, what's this... nostalgia for playing minecraft at the library in middle school and watching sky does minecraft cause a 13year old  girl didn't know how to download mods.
Oof
wait what Minecraft the chosen one he's back let us celebrate to the mead hall
You‚Äôre the only reason I decided to get a YouTube account. Just wanted to like your vids.
WHATTTTT
Y u sound so depressed?
Does anyone know the feeling where something is so nostalgic you don‚Äôt want to go back to it because it‚Äôs too sad
Play with ssundee plz sky

you used to be so popular but then pewdiepies username turned out to be something that makes people forget the name sky does minecraft
You dislike and your gay
Second

I
MINE PRANKS!!!
Hey if you do more try not to laugh I thought up an idea for you, use the sims crystal hat, build a small pool and act all happy until the ladder to leave the pool gets broken, then just look up at the person in the center and say "why". then die, have Ross dressed up as the grim reaper walk to the edge of the pool and say "fifth one this week, huh..."
Roses are red
Ketchup is to
I got a like....
But why is it blue? :O
Jerome: HELP SUPPORT THE SERVER
Me: 
Jerome: HELP SUPPORT ADAM AND ME
Me: joins
Sky best youtuber in da world üåé
Who else on the hype train for the new AoT seasons?
There is no reason for Sky to play because the crew is not here like Max, Jess, Red and Barney
You seem happy! nvn
Jerome is such a sell out, he sounds scripted. Adam doesn't seem interested aswell, most likely just doing this series for money
My heart cannot physically handle a cops and robbers episode. Please do it ‚ù§Ô∏è
It feels like 2013 again, everything back on track to a happier time.
Sky is back 

I am glad

I missed him so much

Now he uploads a lot

My relationship with Minecraft is stronger

My life is  
Who else has been watching since the sky does Minecraft series like the original one
I LOVE YOU ADAM SINCE THE BEGINNING MAN no seriously, much love to you and your growth as a human being over all ‚ù§Ô∏è
Modded cops and robbers! Love you Adam ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You should do pokemon cops and robbers for the dective pikachu movie
Jerome: ‚ÄúCan we steal their kidneys?‚Äù 
Sky: ‚Äúyea‚Äù 
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Your the first true YouTuber I started watching since 2014
Omg!! Please do Klub Ice once more üòÇüòÇ
Do a sonic movie themed cops and robbers. Glad you are back uploading Minecraft again.üëç
I need sky to see this

Which is better??
BUDDER or the nasty squid
Play Cops N' Robbers with NO MODS! That would be interesting!
This came in my subscription box
Cops and Robbin my heart. Jk jk but keep up the work guysüòÇ
Oh my God if i see Sky do a Cops 'n' Robbers again after all this time I'm gonna cry
It's not Cops 'n Robbers without the original crew. If you can still get in touch with them, you NEED to get them on!
Red light green light cops and robbers with blimps, preferably with that one custom vehicle block mod OR the red pill and escape this prison that you call reality prison
How about Cops N' Robbers with the Mortal Kombat mod?
Modded cops and robbers with CELEBRITY GRILLING DOG GEORGE FOREMAN!!!!!!!!
Team Crafted Cops and Robbers!?... Ok that's a little much to ask, but Man's can hope.
THE NOSTALGIA ;-;

IM CRYING. I REMEMBER BEING SEVEN AND TURNING THE VOLUME DOWN SO MY PARENTS WOULNT HEAR THE SWEARS XD
I want to watch Sky play some BODIL parkour maps with deadlox and MCU. Man that would be a major nostalgia trip
MODDED COPS AND ROBBERS IS A MUST TOO EVERYONE LIKE
Modded CAR! :P

Also I wanna see more DNL (Do Not Laugh)
Yea do cops and robbers, and just classic cops and robbers! Maybe you can get the old gang as well! :D
YO WHEN DID ADAM COME BACK I'M SO HAPPY!!


Btw I have been gone for a while since he quoted minecraft
Ah yesh It's been a while since I see your videos : D
Cops and robbers mod suggestions

‚Ä¢DC superhero/villain mod
‚Ä¢marvel superhero/villain mod
‚Ä¢Any anime mods
‚Ä¢Assassins creed mod
‚Ä¢anything you think is cool
I legit got goosebumps through the intro
I see adam discovered the zoom effect üòÇ
Born too late to explore the earth, born too early to explore the universe, born just on time to explore r/dankmemes
Hell yeah man, do a Marvel cops and Robbers. THICCNOS
Thank you sky. Just thank you.
I miss the pirate series
i watched him since he started
and when he stopped kinda made me upset, because he helped me through everything i was going through at the time, when i was upset i would watch his videos to cheer me up.
this is so nostalgic i feel overwhelmed because i remember me and my friends would just laugh so much while watching these videos :((

You should do a cops and robbers  but instead the prisoners rule the prison. They each have an area to protect (for example, Adam in the kitchen to stop the warden from getting food) and stop the warden from getting on their land/escaping. Prisoners get full iron armour and an iron sword, warden gets full diamofu armour and a diamond sword.

I'm probably the only one who wants to see this but Adam if u could do a klub ice cops and robbers it would be amazing
Adam dosent sound like his usual self. He sounds sad and not into the game. I am worried. It's probably just me, but I grew up watching him, so, I hope Adam is ok. Funny. I used to call him Sky. Anyway, I feel like he doesn't like Minecraft as much as he used to. I already have depression, and seeing one of my idols, makes me extremely sad. He was the one that made me love minecraft, or else I would have stayed with Roblox. Adam, please be ok.

Man i feel like im 10 again watching skydoesminecraft while eating ceral
Adam you were honestly my childhood youtuber and I feel so happy to see you come back to us. You do seem like a bit down, but I hope us viewers and fans will make you feel as happy as ever. Loads of stuff has went through your life, but don‚Äôt think we would ever leave you as the sort of fanbase we are. You are honestly the only youtuber I recall the most when it came to childhood videos. 
Seeing you now is always a gift because of the fact that we get to see new stuff from you, whatever the things you show us are. I am always going to be on your side, you don‚Äôt have to appease us. We just want to see you smile.

Also, a Cops and Robbers video? I haven‚Äôt seen one of these since the dawn of time, and it makes me filled with joy. I remember the olden days, and I remember you posting your first Cops and Robbers video. That video was also the first time I was introduced to Jerome, so the fact you‚Äôre doing it with him now is very nostalgic.
Thanks Adam.
:)
Take back the LUCKY BLOCKS!
A good idea would be to maybe return to a known mod, like idk...Disasters mod, Fnaf mod, Superheros mod, or anti gravity mod.
If you guys play Cops and Robbers again, how about you do a session without any mods this time?
Play cops and robbers frozen theme
Those porkchops look like potatoes

This is probably my only chance I‚Äôll ever have for you to see my comment. I just wanna say thanks for getting me through my childhood Adam, I was never depressed or anything, I just was picked on a lot in school for liking Minecraft. But I still watched your videos because they made me laugh, I‚Äôm almost a senior in highschool and I still watch them so thank you for everything. Stay buddery you magnificent bastard XD and sorry for being clich√© and saying this but I‚Äôve been trying to say it for a long LOOOONG time and this is one of the first time I‚Äôve seen a comment section where I have a chance of you seeing it, so if you do see it please let me know some how
Sky reply you‚Äôre my childhood hero
Hoes mad x24
I‚Äôm so sorry your resorted to this again Adam a lot of us know this game and kind of content doesn‚Äôt make you happy anymore and I‚Äôm sorry for asking this but I miss your RP videos but above all else please do what makes you happy m8
meh.

Funny cops n robber
Superhero CopsNRobbers
Imagine it like this 
It‚Äôs 2012 you just got home from school and a fresh skydoesminecraft video came out. You‚Äôre excited. That excitement is what I‚Äôm feeling now 7 years later
Fuq yeah cops n robbers
Spoilers for Adamgame: Budder Parkour Map revamped, New Budder Monsters, Budder Budder, reasons is captured again? Jason  is turning into budder! Mitch is I'll and needs the Budder needle to be better, Jerome is turning yellow, caveman is trapped by buwser, all of his friends got kidnapped by the squds, can sky save them in time?
I know its been a while, but can you try to recouncel with mitch? I want you and bajan to play together again
Sky lost his enthusiasm
Attack on titan cops and robbers
There should be a meme cops and robbers again
Sky if you see this comment please also please keep making videos because it helps me through rough times thanks you
Can't wait for that Cops N Robbers recording in a few days ;)
yes look at the majestic adam bird  soar through the sky..... beautiful
Anyone else uncontrollably smile when Adam calls gold butter the nostalgia is real
Seems like sky's doin better: both at game and overall personality!! Also speaking of castles reminded me of fallen kingdom-
So who's gonna tell sky he has to pause between attacks to do more damage?
AAHHHH OMG SKYY I SWEAR TO YOU I DON‚ÄôT CARE WHAT YOU PLAY BECAUSE YOU MAKE EVERY GAME BETTER
Could it be that I am early?!?!

Hey Sky, just wanna say I'm glad u r able to spend time with your family and Mason, I hope u r doing well and thank you so much for the memories, and also playing Minecraft again. Love ya. #GAMERSRISE #TeamCrafted
My favourite video since cops and robbers
Every time I hear the intro now I can‚Äôt stop smiling. Your the best Adam!!!!
*I BELIEVE I CAN FLY* love ur content Adam, here since 26th vid :)
Since when was he uploading again?! I literally just looked him up to watch his old videos and when I saw he uploaded 6 hours ago I was like "WHAT!? SKY'S BACK!?" IM SOSOSOOSOSOSOSOO HAPPYYY!!
Dropsy is like the aphmau of the group. XD
I HAVENT WATCHED YOU SINCE I WAS 9, THE MEMORIES AND MY CHILDHOOD WANTS TO THANK YOU. :))))
wow. wow. i watched sky like 5 years ago, i just completely remembered his name damn. this is pure nostalgia
Love it, keep it up brings back the memories‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Lol I‚Äôm already laughing and not even 10 seconds in
One second in and I'm already like what the heck lol that so majesticüòÇüòÇ
SKYYYYYYYYYYYY its BUTTTTERRRRR

Edit:

Sky:Mayo

Me: 
Throwback Monday in 3....2...1








Cooking with Earl
Sky's still used to the old minecraft spamming attacks xD
I think we got a glimpse of the old Adam back
I love this video but it pains me that Adam still doesn't know how to do the combat from the 1.9 update.
So I was looking at a comment section for some random minecraft video. Saw a comment that said skydoesminecraft is making videos again so I had to check... and boom! Saw this 11hour ago video, looked up and saw I was subscribed to you. I suddenly remembered the moment I subscribed about 6 or 7 years ago. 

You are my childhood hero, keep doing what you're doing my hero, I will always support you!!
I really just miss GTA wit friends

Barney...red...max...WEENIEBUTT, WEENIEBUTT WEENIEBUTT!
Hope you are doing great Adam!!üíû
Man, I love SkyDoesMinecraft it‚Äôs a shame that his Music Career go super good.
Me:-watching the clouds-
Me:what a lovely-
sees Adam fly
Me:is that a moth man?!
Just came back from the music video and am in tears
I havent been here since... '13... I think
Sky i remember the days that i subscribe you when you only have 1 million subscribers
im actually so happy that Adam is back and I cried when he came back
Love your vids, watching you since i was 7
Love Adam's energy in this vid.
This made my day, thanks Adam ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can't help but be worried. Is he really okay? Or is this just a front? He seemed to have really bad issues and actually looked like he wanted to separate from minecraft. 
I don't know it's just a concern of mine.
in 1.9+ wait for the thing right of your cursor to have the plus next to it, then your attacks will be fully powered.
Jerome sounds like Grid from Red vs Blue
Been watching since 3rd grade. I‚Äôm in 6th now. 

üí´
Adam helping saying ‚ÄúWoo!‚Äù at the start made me so giddy! The nostalgia! ;^;
Sky, do u still remember the "HUNGER GAMES GONE WRONG"
Video?
#SkyDoesEverything
Y‚Äôall need to do tnt wars like in the good old days
its the magical stick of butter in the air! quick throw subscriptions at it so it can grow more powerful! don't forget to pat jerome and call him fluffy
those wings are absolutely magnificent I love them
That intro gave me life
He protecc
He attacc 
But most importantly...
SkyDoesMinecraft came bacc
You made ONE video of Clusterchunk. You've gotta make another
Adam at the very end: That was fun!.
Me: Starts crying tears of joy and looking like I‚Äôm seeing my baby grow
You should try playing on the Wynncraft server
Dang it the notifications dint work im happy to see you back
Yea ive haven't been watching lately but now I'm back into watching you bro keep doing what u do.
why not make cops n robbers? 
i grew up watching them you know?
i just had an amazing joke idea for if you ever return to do not laugh, by the way i tihnk you should do more do not laugh videos.


here's the joke:
1: get a skin that looks like yours but slightly different
2: you start the joke and call yourself stygoesdinecraft or something else similar to your name
3: you say that you have a promising business opportunity
4: you then place a bunch of minecart tracks and say: "You wanna buy some rails?"
I believe I can fly 






Shooting them with an M4 so they will die
There we go the amazing sky does Minecraft can fly......... If only everything was butter
Sky you are my childhood I remember do not laugh and hide n seek with aphmau
I just found an anime and you are a voice actor in it 
Tokyo esp
A natural Adam in his habitat..

‚Äú AAWOOOOWOOOWOOO.‚Äù

His beautiful mating call.

‚Äú AAAAWWWWWOOOOWWWWOOOOOWWWWOOOOO.‚Äù * viciously eating butter. *

‚Äú Ah, yes. And his diet. Butter.‚Äù

‚Äú AAAAAA-‚Äú
I still can‚Äôt believe this is real
I swear all I did at night was watch these videos and laugh my ass off. I miss the parkour maps with Jason and Ty
Ngl seeing this old into brings tears to my eyes
Eveytime I watch these videos, they make me smile.
Why tf am i subbed to you?


Nvm im not anymore
I've been waiting fpr you adam

I love how you can see that sky's commentary is improving from video to video
OMG I REMEMBER WATCHING YOU ALL THE TIME, god i miss the good ol days

I really missed this, Thank you Adam.
YAY Your still doing the same intro, and posting videos üòÅüòÅüòÅ I‚Äôve never been able to watch your vids in like 2 years.. I missed those days
Hey Sky!!!! You still don't kbow how to use a sword!!!
That opening already killed meüíÄ
I liked the old, raw, sky. Not this hard cut every second, zoom in, kinda sky(Adam,) love you always boo.
HEY ADAM, GUESS WHAT

PASTRAMI CITY!
The intro!!! I love it ü§£ü§£
Will you ever try todo a video with Ross again

I love how enthusiastic Jerome and Adam are and it makes it all the more fun to watch :)
Clicks video* 
Adam : woooo woo wooo
Is it just me or does sky have the best game modes
Keep up the good work man.
When are you gonna do public servers again?
I love it that they‚Äôre back, been with Adam from the beginning but I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôre using old mics for nostalgia or if it‚Äôs a reference he thinks he‚Äôs never left, or if Jerome‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt gotten a better one since 2013 Minecraft hunger games
It‚Äôs sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good to see u back up and running sky
I miss roommates
Remember the maze series ?

And the pirate series?
Question, what happened to ross
I love Jerome‚Äôs and sky‚Äôs friendship
It sounds like adam is become more hyped each video
Adam what is that introü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Is it true that your friends held you hostage in room 208 yesterday?
Adam: (plays old intro)
Me: there goes the tear ducts
He couldn't do damage cause he didn't wait for the bar to go full
10/10 Love it
This is the coolest thing I've seen in a while =0
Can you get munchingbrotato back?
1st
sky please learn the timing of attacksüòÇüòÇüòÇ you keep forgetting about it ant already told it to youüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Did it change from Minecraft to you very thing and am I late?
Adam seems like he's getting better and seems overall happy in this video instead of distant. I followed him for 5 years now and it makes me so happy that hes doing better!
Ive been watchin u since i was 9,now im 14 ur still cool in my book adam
Hey Adam, I just wanna say a quick thank you for all the years I have been with you. You've helped me through all the hard times and your videos always made me laugh. It's good to see you back, you truly are amazing. There is much more I want to thank you for and much more i want to say to you, but I got an assignment that I need to wrap up or else  I won't be going to 7th grade. ANYWAYS thanks so much, have the time of your life, and life is too short not to live it. Goodbye.

I'd like to say something. I haven't been into Minecraft in a long time but since I've discovered your come back and all you've went through, the fact that you've picked yourself back up and started doing these videos is inspiring. I was 12 when I last saw your videos. It's been 4 years and even now you make me smile.

Wait?! I thought you went on to do music? Why are back in this whole? 
Minecraft is great and all. But I would be tired to death already. 

Unless the music career didn‚Äôt work out. And due to you making a fool of yourself on YouTube before, nobody wants to hire you? 
I hope not. I wish you luck in anything that you‚Äôre doing.
HES BACK!!!!
link to the mod?
Magnificent
This video is nostalgic for some reason...
Sky have you heard of elytra?
SKYYUYYYYYY
So music at all? I liked your music but I also like your gaming videos.
Sky‚Äôs enthusiasm is almost gone
Im going to cry im so happy your back

When you like before you even watch the video because you know it's gonna be good
Pog

minecraft... is back.... memories... ;(
AC130 ABOVE
Mini game Minecraft videos are what killed the MC YT community
43 seconds in, Sky calls Jerome "Fluffy".
Ohhh the nostalgia!!!!!
I can feel my childhood slowly being resurrected
the minecraft uprising of 2019 is the best thing about 2019 currently, and the nostalgia is so fucking lovely.  have a good day babes
Happy to see you back and enjoying what you do, especially with your friends. Thanks for making me laugh as a kid and still to this day.

Edit : Happy you guys feel the same, too :)
Team butter since #2010
Don't you mean: Team Budder!
That intro has me fucking shook with nostalgia man. I remember being like 10 just replaying that intro over and over cuz it was so iconic.
Jerome: ‚ÄúSpeaking of fluffy, there‚Äôs 8 million dollars on my head‚Äù
Me: **focuses brain power into understanding the connection**‚Äù
All we need now is Cops And Robbers who agrees?
YOU SHOULD'VE HAD A WARNING BEFORE THAT INTRO I'M OVERWHELMED WITH NOSTALGIA
I do miss Sky calling Jerome Fluffy :3
In 2018 everyone was depressed. Sky was also gone. Coincidence? I think not.
Title: includes butter in reference to gold
Me: YES YES YES YES MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK
Ok guys who hired the necromancer. He is resurrecting my childhood.
And here we have sky slowly taking his baby steps into become the legendary youtuber he once was, plus he's also resurrecting our childhood with his videos that helped us once upon a time
The part where Sky called Jerome ‚ÄúFluffy‚Äù just about killed me with nostalgia
first. Sky I have watched you since 2013
normal people: gold team
Sky army: budder team
Me: My childhood sure is reviving 

Costs: It costed adams mic quality 

Me: what...




EDIT: Why is my like button blue?
Hi, love the vids and its great you're back, u were my first youtuber i watched, i first watched u in 2011! so proud of u!
Can we show Adam our support of the bathroom audio?
Don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm just a random gacha person passing by UwU
when you called Jerome fluffy I almost died. Keep up the amazing work sky!! You're doing great

Get it?
Ok so we get ur early and yt says ur the first comment but in reality there‚Äôs tons of people so it doesn‚Äôt work out yt jjst glitches sometimes so instead of saying first say #earlysquad or #notificationsquad or somethingü§£‚ù§Ô∏è
Anyone know a mincraft server like this but for bedrock edition?
Anyone else going through a nostalgia run?
Wait I didnt know sky still made videos wow same intro and the butter woe uts been so long
#BackInTheDayJeromeCrashedARecording

Edit:

Sky: 

Me: 
OMG he is back ! I heard rumors BUT HE IS ACTUALLY BACK! MY CHILDHOOD HAS RETURNED
What did you gain? 

"My childhood back.." 

What did it cost? 

"Adam's mic quality"
I have never clicked on a notification faster
Who was here when he did the trollface quest
The trollface moon still makes ne laugh

i can't stop smiling, especially after Jerome said "You haven't called me 'Fluffy' in so long!"
U were one of my favorite youtubers as a kid n still or to this day i qatched your videos when i was like 7 or 8
When u want to play with them but don't even own a pc and is too broke to even get minecraft
You should play Bajan's server - Kingdoms
Video Title: WHO IS ON TEAM BUTTER?!
Me: I am, since... I can't remember when I first watched one of his videos, dammit.

Here's a brilliant idea. Claim eachothers bounty and make millions.
(Idk if the system even works that way it just popped into my head)
Budder Forever!!!

SKY!!!!!........sup
Welcome back sir. We missed you.
This is lowkey cringe but it‚Äôs clearly part of Adam‚Äôs therapy and is helping him get happier so I‚Äôm ok with it lol
Budder squad, where you at!?!?
Ok but NOW we just need mod showcases back and I‚Äôm good to go! Those were my life!
You're making grown men cry tears of nostalgic joy
That moment when you realize you have been watching Adam for 8 years, and is still watching him as a teen in high school. Can't wait for the glory days to come back.
Is this a reupload or new content??
Rip :C [*]
You guys should play diversity 3! Ahh. sniff nostalgia
I saw the thumbnail and i thought, "My childhood is coming back hell yeah"
I HAVE ONE FRICKIN QUESTION, WHAT ABOUT THE ROLEPLAYS, DONT LEAVE MEH ON A CLIFFHANGER, END ONE OR TWO PLEASE.

I used to watch u 6 years ago
Thank you for coming back Sky. This video just came out when I got back from the ER.

i miss out on all the stuff :(
i've been on team butter for ever, and i always will be
I'm so glad minecraft is making a comeback this year. happy to see your vids again after so long!
Is it just me, or does Adams chill voice recording, make him sound hotter than usually?
I'm seven minutes LATE!!!
Does anyone know why Adam's mic quality sounds different?
people need time to get away from a game before they can truly enjoy it again glad you're back
I mean I still hated squids for Adam since he also hated squids, that was a long time before in the good old Minecraft.
Hearing Adam call Jerome Fluffy again warmed my heart. Reminds me of the golden days.
i love your vids been watching for 6 years remeber cops n robbers omg my best momments
It's like Adam went back in time and started back when TeamCrafted was a thing...
"And I- will- wait- I- Will- Wait- For you!"
Watched Jerome's now time for Adam's view point.
If Jerome wins. You need to say, "I cant believe it's not butter."
I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!! YOU'RE AWESOME AND AMAZING AND I LOVE YOU AND YOUR CONTENT!!!!!!!!! KEEP IT UP ADAM!!!!!!!!
It been so long since I watch sky gold:butter
WHEN HE SAID FLUFFY I CRIED
Is this real? :0 I thought it was a re-uploaded video but it‚Äôs not, this is great :)
Early squad I love you dude
I grew up watching your mod videos and adventure maps
I've watched you since about 2012 when I was just a little kid and seeing you upload again literally brought me to tears.
Adam was too powerful...
12:43

So my grandma had leukemia. She got over it and survived, and me and my family were so happy. But she recently in her recovery got a massive fever of 103.4¬∞. She saw her doctor and he said that she got it back, acute cancer. At her age and point of recovery she has slim to no chance of surviving. Moral is to spend time with those you love. You never know when they‚Äôll die or how fast.
all i need is some adventure maps and some minecraftuniverse and thats a step back to the past
I am
Who else was 7-10 years old and checking back when your 14 or 15 years old
Bedwars plaease man

ME
So did your music career fail or something? I don‚Äôt understand why you started doing Minecraft videos again. You listed some pretty good reasons why you left. Was it money?

We're back in the year 2000 where sky's mic audio is bad
So basically cookie clicker? ü§£

Not to get sappy, but thank you so much for coming back Sky. I've been watching your videos since close to the beginning and when you returned I found a source of happiness that I didn't know I missed- your videos give me so much joy, so thank you again Sky for coming back!!
Sky you are my favorite person and I love your music
Anyone remember the "The New World" üò™
Adam... you doing okay man? You sound off in this video.
Is the 1.5K like:  i never felt more special
Is he back? Or this is just re uploaded?
Bring back team crafted Or make a new Team????
the mic peaking reminds me of a simpler time
The intro hasn‚Äôt changed for years, ah the times. Prison escape and fun times.
Minecraft added feature tips:
Like so sky can see
1. 1.9 update changed PVP so with weapons you need to wait a bit after hitting for more damage. This is shown by the crosshair in middle of screen.
2. Aquatic updates allow you to venture into the deep, find shipwrecks and treasures, as well as crafting the trident
3. A swimming animation was added. It allows you to swim faster. Just sprint then jump in the water and keep holding spring key.
Hope this helps üôÉ
Did sky forget how to play Minecraft
I‚Äôm liking the more subdued title. Less caps.
Hi sky I love Butter as much as you
That is gonna be an oof from me bois
You can win. Never give up unless they offer you a cookie

EVERYTHING‚ÄôS REVIVING. YESSSSSS.
adam and jerome clapped them by taking there cookies
YAAAAASSSSS
I feel old. But happy
So happy to have the miecraft videos back
Hi Sky! I have a suggestion to make, can you please please please do a Battledome like you did before because I absolutely loved those videos
Host a Reddit RIGHT
allow people to make new intros for you cause this one is SO OLD
Sky I has an idea on what your next video should be, but if you don't want to do it it's fine. Here it is. The game is called Dark Deception it's a horror game that mimics Pac-man check it out but if you don't it's fine it's just a suggestion.



Edit: I had to change the word smh to sky cause I was auto corrected.

Nice video
Have a great day sky if you are having a rough day I believe in you and you are stronger than you think.
Woot
H20 delirious has the same amount of subs but he gets 30k likes at least
Hey Adam, just a heads up. There's a small timer for attacks now. So, basically that line that appears under your plus thingy(Can't remember what that's called for the life of me). If you wait for that to refill, rather than just spam clicking, you will do more damage. I can't remember the version number exactly, but while you were away one of the updates added an  "Attack Cool-down".
This
brain do not laugh back
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
are these real like real time or pre recorded??
cool
cool

Hey sky how would you feel if we made a you a nicer more modern intro?

Stop spamming attack. It does less damage if u spam.
YouTube is going back 
To it's 2013 phase
Pewdiepie is uploading games (sometimes)
Skydoeseverything does Minecraft
The trending tab is finally fixed
Vikk is back uploading Minecraft
Fortnite is kinda dying (not dying but out of attention)
I've been watching ur videos since 2012 and ur vids are the best but the worst mistake u ever made was changing your name to skydidminecraft because you lost a lot of loyal subscribers and your vids just are the same. U sound so so and u sound no longer as energetic as u were. I hope you gain back your success in the future. Peace and good luck
Whooo
Wow, he's still making minecraft videos
I'm sorry where did the quality content go?  I get it nostalgia but at least do something entertaining like all you did was steal their stuff and then slaughter them. :(
Adam really isn‚Äôt enjoying Minecraft like the old days I could tell
Sky are you still friends with the watermelon guy.?
I'm to old for to watch Minecraft but. I'ma still do it
Adam do you know fitz? You'll probably have fun hanging out with him cuz I think you guys have the same humour other than that tnx for wasting ur time and giving us content we appreciate it very much
Bring back bedwars
sky PVP is different now if you want to get more kills you have to let your weapon charge there is a little bar underneath your crosshair once that bar is full again you should attack but only when it is full
Does anyone else remember bend the knee? That was bomb, Adam are you gonna be netbobody anymore I‚Äôm not pushing I just ant to know

WHAT THE HELL WHY IS THIS HAPPENING YOUR NAME IS SKY DOES EVERY THING?
I want the old sky this one seems to calm
Wow what the heck! I thought you stopped making minecraft videos ages ago!
I‚Äôm confused I heard sky quit Minecraft
hey sky. you should get with ssundee and play some fortnite with him and crainer.
hmmm kinda hoped the old adam that used to cuss non stop was back but i guess this will do
I feel like sky is just not enjoying himself
So basically it's money wars
I thought ant told sky not to spam attack
This is bringing me back to 12 years old
BRING BACK SSUNDEE TO MINECRAFT PLS SKY
Did I get stuck in 2014?
food
Hai
All I do is funny videos is all I‚Äôm saying
i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a video with this amount of likes and so little dislikes
i mean i love sky but i dont know if hes doing this for fun or money didnt he said he hated minecraft
Play bedwars
So glad you‚Äôre doing Minecraft again, Sky! I started watching your Minecraft videos back in 2013. When you stopped, I felt a part of my childhood died. But now you‚Äôre back and I‚Äôve regained some of my childhood! Thank you, Sky!
sky plz plz plz make your name "skydoesminecraft" again
what year is this? Am I 12 again? Please tell me that's the case...
Oof
Oof
Hey Adam, i know that alot of people are happy that you're making more Minecraft videos, but  in this video i dont know if your just sick or not feeling that well but from what it looks like to me, i dont think you're enjoying yourself in these videos. Me personally, i havent watched any of your recent Mc vids because I like to think that it was a point in my life when that happened where it was good and fun and would kind of be "ehh" to bring it back since it wouldnt be as good as the old videos were. So i dont know if you always sound like this or if its just this video, but im just assuming that you aren't happy doing this. I might be wrong but if you dont enjoy doing this then dont do it. Yeah people might be sad but in the end whatever makes you happy is more important than Minecraft videos, and i think alot of people would agree with me. Again, i could be wrong but your happiness is important to me fam.
Love you Adam üòä
Hello random person scrolling through the comments! I hope you‚Äôre having a great time watching Sky again!

The Minecraft king is back. So, thats why Minecraft is relevant again. Also, Adam you can turn off the new attack crap and put it back to the old one. It is in your settings.
Anyones else minecraft pe ios doesnt work? How to fix it? It takes really long time to load and freezes when i try to enter a world, please help!

I forgot about you. The only reason I remember is because the idea of playing Minecraft cane to me, and I remember you made this net nobody and tried to do something. Be with the trends or something, you hated Minecraft and being associated with it. I don‚Äôt watch your videos and just by listening to you I can tell you hate playing it. Your net nobody didn‚Äôt work out money wise so you are back here. At least you aren‚Äôt trying to seem all happy like you used too. I hope you figure things out. Don‚Äôt worry about the money, find what your looking for,
the king is rising back from the dead üò≠ is the crew reforming too??
Ug
Adam is slowly getting happier and I love it üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Omg the gang is back!! Who‚Äôs been watching him seance 2012 like if u are

I wonder how many people cried when sky said he was coming back I know I did

Hello
Hello
Sky, for years I‚Äôve watched you to get away from school, home problems, and my parents. For years my mom and dad argue on the phone about court and custody.Ever since you have come back I‚Äôve felt so much better. During your break, I looked back, not only your mod reviews but all the way back. And, I realized how much I have and this family(sky army) has grown. I haven‚Äôt felt this happy ever since 2017. Thank you
Sky i've watched you since 2013-2014'ish now im glad that your back and its cool af. But I feel like your not having fun or your not feeling as enthusiastic playing minecraft during the good old days. Just saying it's my opinion
Getting stuck in 2012
Hi
Adam ask Jerome to make a sorting system with you. Have everything in one area for collecting and selling.
üåπüíüüëë
Only OG people will remember.... Team Crafted
I love that Adams playing minecraft and he sounds like he's genuinely having fun, but in this series it sounds artificial, like either he's trying to make things sound more positive because the video is sponsored, or he's trying to force himself to have fun
Yeah right

Sky if you read this I have a message for you please bring back your face cam and bring back gta5 please
Am I the first person or nah
You should do mod reviews again. Because those were pretty funny because most people just show the mod and not do much. But when you did them they where actually funny because the humour used in them. But its good to see you came back
I‚Äôm legit crying memories...
24 million dollars O_O
you dropped those wands when you died bro. F
?
So a lot of stuff you had access to wouldn't be for beginners, right? You have to pay real life money for a lot of the things you guys had access to, right?
I respected you coming back but I‚Äôve lost all respect, you are subbed to T-Series.
I won! It was definitely totally true 
Give me money
Sky, KermitMC heard your apology in your minecraft episode 2 and tweeted a response forgiving you. Please unblock him on twitter and let him know you hear it <3

What happend to your canal you used to be the best
You should get a new intro its getting kinda old
I was so hurt when he didn't stack the carrots
But
You're doing great Adam
Oh man, sky not stacking the golden carrots hurts me a lil bit
You know he's an o g player when he doesn't stack his food
Me: "It can't be that long since Sky has played standard survival, he must know books require leather."
Sky: Doesn't know food is stackable
Me: "Oh"
every episode sends me back, this is just great
Warnning this commemt section contains
90% carrots
10% quality comments
AntVenom seriously needs to teach Adam the new combat system....
Sky, you're a veteran player, and the sky army respects that, I remember in the old days players can't stack food, so it's okay, do what you want man.
SKY:ant look at my this nether snowman spawns a wither Ant: SKY NOOO!
sky you made me happy at 26:58 
i thought they would stay unstacked forever




oh my gosh these are stackable i thought the like button cant stack
When he placed the carrots through-out his inventory sksksk
yOu'Re dOiNg GrEaT sKy :D
It's sad to think a guy with over 1900 minecraft lets plays could forget about the game so much
The intro: *plays*
My nostalgia lvl: 99999999
Also, he must LOVE that wood pick and stone sword
This intro man, so much nostalgia! üò≠üò≠üò≠
i remember watching you on my tablet at like 3 am and my mom walking in my room and yelling at me for staying up. when i got my tablet back i did the same thing again
Damn this reminds me of when I was little and hid my iPod to watch you
It makes me sad when he doesn't know some things. But I'm happy that he does this still. He's trying and he is happy
Let me just say I almost cried when Ant mentioned "Let Have Some fun In Minecraft" and teared up more when Adam catched up to that and sang apart of it a little.. 
Seeing a veteran go back and learn minecraft again is really enjoyable
The amazing amount of luck through these TWO episodes has been astounding
Let's Have Some Fun In Minecraft!!! OH-oh-OH-ohh
Title: WE FOUND DIAMONDS?

Thumbnail: Netherportal

Me: ???
Ya‚Äôll talking about sky not stacking the carrots but what about Sky not throwing away his wooden pick?
The lack of stacking carrots and his unorganized hotbar made my ocd die a little
Ant: There's a new combat system, you don't spam click anymore

Sky: Spam clicks even in the episode after
Hello sky you have a new episode again ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòá you make my childhood happy with that minecraft‚ù§Ô∏è
Me: call it butter, call it butter!
Adam:Gold
His inventory is bugging me so much.
It still surprises me that this series actually exists, and that these aren‚Äôt recordings from years ago. It‚Äôs great.
The fortress was like club ice
They kept wanting to go back
I found it easy to get lots of diamonds in ravines underwater in the ocean.
Its been so long since sky was making minecraft videos. Sky, you were my favorite Minecraft youtuber. When you quit it made me sad, but I never gave up. I knew you would come back one day. #SkyArmyLivesOn
27:25 my mind talking at the start of the video after he didn't stack the carrots
3:25
Adam, no!
No, Adam! Stop!
Adam, please stop!
ADAM NO!
STOP!
Am I the only one who noticed that sky's skin and antvenom's skin are wearing similar clothes (if not the same)?
This feels like he was in a coma and is learning everything he used to know! Welcome back sky, I missed your minecraft vids!
10:20
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have some fun in Minecraft...‚Äù
Wow, I remember that and almost got teary...
12:42 OH GAWDD T-T
I love this so much but antvenom saying gold instead of butter kinda hurt me haha
Sky singing the old minecraft parodies warmed my heart
I‚Äôm so glad sky is back doing minecraft
He didn't stack up the carrots. 
How long has he not played o.O
sky you the best at minecraft now again








butter !!!!
My favorite minecraft related parodys is like six or seven years ago sky made "The Budder Song"
24 carrots. Unintentional gold joke?

Edit: I shouldn't comment until after I've watched the whole video.
................BUDDER!!!!
Man it always feels good to say that
1 view 20 likes 3 comments ?? What the
Someone please remind Adam of the attack cooldown?! It hurts to see the spam click not working as it did! :(
38:54 possibly the best thing ever in this episode is how adam is 100% chill when he‚Äôs about to die and ant just goes into panic mode
When he remembered let's have some fun in Minecraft I got so happy
mfw there was a but of Lapis by the Dungeon they stumbled upon
Uugghh the intro music gives me SO MUCH NOSTALGIA
27:07 ‚ÄúOh my gosh. These are stackable??‚Äù

why is that so endearing omfg
Yo he's alive? fellow gamers he's back! GAMERS RISE
Does he know he can stack golden carrots?
13:05 this really be a zooweemama moment
I'd normally be annoyed when watching someone fumble like that with crafting and stacking the carrots but bless adam he's trying his best lmao
Mate i haven't seen your vids a solid 6 or 8 years and i see the old intro playing it just brings me back keep going Adam your doing awesome ^^
That 24 karat pun was golden c:
30:19

‚ÄúFull iron armor‚Äù

Who wants to tell em that sky doesn‚Äôt have boots or a helmet
Adam:*picks up 4 diamonds
Ant:*picks up 2 diamonds

We need communism
Love you Adam‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ You're great.
Sky
If you ever see a lot of Clay/Terracotta covering the ground: Dig into the earth.
Cause that is where the budder's at!
üéµLet's have some fun in Minecraftüéµ üò≠
This is my biome, its what I call home. All of my time i spent building you, from the moment I spawn, whenever I log off. I know it will always be me and you.
I've been waiting since like 2013 to see another antvenom-sky teamup.
There was lapis when they went to the dungeon but idk if they found it already I‚Äôm like 17 mins in
He started from the beginning...very good.

Sky: "Should I break the spawner?"
Both me and Ant at the same time and rate (not joking actually): "Nonononono!"
you're doing just fine adam!
you're actually getting much better at the game and i love seeing you progress
Long time no see Adam, remember epic craft, you doing any of that? Or epic jump maps.

Ant venom when are you going back to Carson‚Äôs SMP Live? Jschlatt misses you.
Me: spawns Enderdragon to gain xp
Builders on the server:
Legend sky uploads another hope you get this bro we love you and the fact you back
Mojang should make an update where you could make a backpack out of leather and the back pack should give you extra storage.
THE INTRO !!!!
sky..?

you can stack golden carrots, you know...
"The fact that WE have full iron armor..." was said when adam only had iron leggings and an iron chestplate
Adam you should add fluffy in the server so there's more person talking for the commentary üòä
36:50 ‚ú®friendship‚ú®

Lit Intro!!!
I have been playing on my world before there was hunger bars damn
The golden carrots gave me so much anxietyü§¢ü§¢
It took me until halfway into this second episode to notice that Adam has Auto-Jump on...
Thx for still making video
loving this series keep it up please!
I can‚Äôt wait for the next episode, these are my favourite so far
40 mins is great for as long as it‚Äôs been!
Its soo adorable how Adam is so Clueless in Minecraft XD
When you like mods, maps and costom skins, but you're on console...*Oof*
The intro

The nostalgia
You should have mined the wood in the mineshaft. Thats what I almost always do when I run out of wood.
SKY I GOT YOUR MERCH I FOUND IT AT GOODWILL my mom did BUT ITS JUST LIKE ITS BRAND NEW!! (btw i subed at 5:01 pm 5/1/2019)
So this is why Antvemon can't play on Carson's SMP.

13:13 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Sky is subbed to T Series no joke
I almost had a heart attack when he started mining the spawner
14:13
people who have watched steven universe cringed at this moment...
Honestly this is becoming one of my favorite playthroughs.
Freakin loving this series already
Very episode beings back flashbacks, u seem sm happier i love ski

In 1.14 you can have all protection types on one piece of armor
The lapis talk of someone seeing laps before...  Was exact lol
Early mah boi, and ur back sky with ant venom YASS
My man sky is evolving into the ultimate minecraft gamer
Adam do you remember the joke that Max was so salty that he can turn a lake into an Ocean?
Nobody:

Absolutely nobody:

Adam:

        -AntVenom 2019
sky not stacking the golden carrots physically hurt my soul
Minnnnnne diaaaamondsssss
I'll see myself out--
Side by side he says Adam then procedes to put them on top of eachother
There is lapis in the roof of the dungeon, I saw it and you didn‚Äôt see it, how dare you
I love watching him, but he sounds so sad, low on energy, i just want the old sky back
19:07
He almost walked into a hole filled with lava
You know what hurts me more? Him still doesn't understanding the combat system
3:55 took me back to alpha when food didn't stack
This is so cool! Keep going! I want to see you guys take on an elder guardian
you need atleast 100k veiws dammit!
This sends me back in the old days of Minecraft
I just noticed the old intro is back.

I haven‚Äôt watched your videos in your years
25:55
Wait, what the hell is going on in this enchanting table?!
he protc he attak but mostly he bring childhood bacc
I was soo annoyed he's spamming his sword, which doesn't work as well as it used to do

Doesn't know they stack
Bro sky we need mine pranks bruh
What was Adam smoking while playing this?
Oh my goshh. Haha, Adamm this is so nice. Lolol its so pure ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Brororo Adam is so cute
Remember that time Sky pranked Ant on a livestream?
my flipping phone is a flip phone
He‚Äôs unlocked the power of the butter carrots
lapis near the zombie dungeon!
So glad you came back (:::: I love Minecraft
Can we go back to cops and robbers
More suspenseful than EndGame
Uh...? Lapis Lazuli is used for blue dye, which is required for anything you
want to make blue, cyan, or light blue (wool, concrete, clay, bed, etc.).
It also shows up in villager trading every now and then, I think...
sniff

Hearing that Opening again... Is amazing
They need 98 minutes to find diamonds....

I've been playing Minecraft in 3 weeks and don't have a diamond..
SKY'S UPLOADING,HELL YEAH BOOOOOIIIIIIII
It‚Äôs confirmed we‚Äôre back baby. WOOOO
Adam on the CallMeCarson Streamer SMP server........?








That would be an epic gamer moment
The intro brings back so much memories
Sky just loves blocking those explosions, I do too. Haha.
The name Einshine hit me hard.
Hank venom hank venom
title: we found diamonds
comments: we found a problem with your carrots
You can stack the golden foods.
1.14 is out , pls play on that version next time , also the golden carrots can stack
sky not calling the gold budder hurts me
Wow, I'm early this time
When your music carrier wasn't good enough
Guys, you should join smp live
I wonder if they know if they can make water elevators with magma blocks and soul sand.
I'm glad there's gonna be more episodes!
Have fun with the new update
It's not the same without Max and Ross üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
26:59 when he stacked the carrots I was finally at peace üò•üòÖ
Did you know that in PC version, when the money inside the spawner is spinning faster, that's when they're about to spawn
The fact that antvenem was explaining things he already knew but didnt stop him was really cool tbh, simple niceties like that are so rare in the community
24 "carrots" lmao
üé∂ I F O U N D  A  D I A M O N D üé∂
Ant should have told him how all the items stack in inventory cause when he didn‚Äôt stack the carrots I got triggered lol...
19:22 I‚Äôm legit that person saying that üòÇüòÇ
yay i love that intro
Aw Sky And Ant are bffs
It's been so long since I've seen these videos and I'm quite happy he has come back.
Sky feels so akward :(
Antvenom is the one who speedrun the nether yet he tells Adam to mine 14 obsidian
the nostalgia is so powerful i thought it was 2012 for a bit
These long, almost unedited format episodes are really great. Minecraft as it was meant to be played, a survival learning experience.
YOU'RE DOING AMAZING SWEETIE
this is so nostalgic also f12 is cords and stuff
When he don't stack the carrot: big oof.
I see everyone using this g word?? Like what?
the way u put together ur inventory bothers me
Bruh the frieking nostalgia from the intro is killing me. Since when has he started uploading vids again?
How do you find diamonds when you have two eyepatches.
UHHH Did i some how MISS something?? I like, did they do a whole series and i didn't know?? Someone help plzzz!!!
Sky not making a helmet was frustrating
Sky does everything.....including re-uploading 6 year old videos
My haert is exploding with nastalga
I like how sky doesn't realizes there are multiple sections in the recipe book
Wait what its more rare than diamonds? I keep finding those lapiz and no diamonds ;-;
O havent seen this intro in a long time. Feels good.
Seeing some Minecraft videos brings joy to my eyes bring back memories
Are you guys going to be going into 1.14? I mean, AntVenom is practically THE EXPERT on that update.
Also i am youing my dads phone
it frustrates me to see how he doesnt care about his inventory being so messy.
hello my left ear 
how is it going
the karat joke, not gonna lie, thought he was referring to a butt-plug
Please go to 1.14 the texture are super nice and the GOLD. The GOLD bar texture is sooo good
Who else is watching and thinking " I could school both of them" I know an exploit that would get them so many diamonds , spawn cages , and shipwrecks too
Good to see you guys still playing. I haven't watched you for like 4 years. Minecraft just made my childhood awesome.
I dont play minecraft anymore but i still luv his vids since he came back to the game
id like him to play with Lazarbeam,2 newbies collide
i know most of the comments are about the the carrots but when he didn‚Äôt stack them all i thought was ‚ÄúYOURE DOING GREAT SKY‚Äù
this is the best, so much nostalgia
This is golden/budder
I kept screaming at my screen to just stack the carrots so 28 minutes in was a relief
Just wanted to tell you that your music is awesome, you just need that big song to get you back to the top
Ngl I think, if he can, needs to get some background music, because some parts is just quiet, which makes it funny from how awkward it is.üòÜ
Why doesnt he say budder anymore he isnt even phased by the sight of it? 
JK I know hes just getting back to it.
40:20 his armor disappeared when he came back to the overworld
The easiest way to let ur inventory have spare space is... Throw out the non-need things. Yeah, easy right
Make an upside down T shape, makes an obsidian weewee
OMG HI ADAM WE ALL LOVE U ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Diamond üíé = bae
Ohh, how I missed this! I sure hope he is having fun.
Ye

Tip for all players

When exploring caves, put your torches on the Left Side
That way, when you're trying to find your way out, you just have to follow the torches back the Right Way
stack the flipping carrots
Adam, You can stack almost anything but a bed.

By the way, Adam, you can stack golden carrots into one slot.
OMG. HELLO SKY :D

This is my favorite series.
I think someone needs to teach ant venom a thing or two
His original happy voice is returning, that is just nostalgic
I'm actually right back where I started.
I miss the old Skyyyyyüò≠üò≠üò≠

You act like you never played before lol
So glad you and your friend @AntVenom are working together, again. Brings me back to 2013 Minecon.

I got very upset when he wanted 5 slots for carrots but I‚Äôm proud of you Adam
! cringe when he doesn't stack the golden carrots :/
>spam clicking like a noob
What is this?





Brings me back tho great to see this again
24 CARROT GOLD!!
Ily Adam
Imagine clicking a video and actually disliking it
Highlight of my day
The nastolgia from watching this...
yayayy !!
Its just so adorable: how he gently does everything, his fixation on diamonds, the auto-jump, the carrots, the puns... Its like a minecraft grandpa X)
did he forgot how to play Minecraft or are they just playing around
I'm hurt... He didn't say "budder"
Are you planning to start over with a world with 1.14?
Really? Lapis has the same spawning as diamonds? Weird I've found lapis alot more common
you guys should update to 1.14
I'm glad that he got in touch with ant venom. he is doing a great job and so are you Adam. :-)
Buddercarrots...
Do mod reviews!
My boi is gettin life in his voice again
S K I T H E R , STACK THY CARROTS
SKY U CAN STACK DA CARROTS
Retitle this " A BUNCH OF PUNS?!"
27:17 IVE BEEN SCREAMING THIS THE ENTIRE TIME
this intro is gAHhHhhhhh throwback
oh man this is content
This is fun :D
EARLY HA!
Glad your back adam!
I'm too old to understand this new minecraft version
You and Ant should do combat training to get used to the new combat mechanics. Just keep a shield up.
Hey Adam, fun fact, you don't need to stick with the traditional 2x3 opening for the Nether Portals now. I don't remember which update it was, but as long as the portal is a rectangular or Squared, it can be activated. So you could make a 3x8 a 7x3, 4x4, 5x6, or whatever size portal you want
10:05 actually made me tear up. Old days
Adam the golden carrots stack.
He didn't correct him its butter
Mine craft yes i missed this
I missed you man...I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
These basic Minecraft gameplays are the best
Skyyyy the golden carrots stack
I keep forgetting we can eat golden carrots
Ik that reference when he siad let's have some fun in minecraft it triggered my brain of the song
I love the intro it was great back then and it‚Äôs even better to hear it now
Rename the series monitisation 101
Antvenom didn‚Äôt gave up since everyone did and came back
Glad to see you and lots of other Minecraft YouTubers making a comeback, but I hope you & AntVenom make it a point to make more chests to keep your stuff from disappearing & going to waste. Other than that relatively minor nitpick, I'm really enjoying this series you two are doing. Keep Up The Good Work!
Love the name learning the ropes
#BringbackDNL
Did you know kakarot is actually carrot?
bro I love it
With new workbenches
I love how relaxing this series is! It‚Äôs nice to just sit there and watch people play Minecraft every once in a while
Love this series !
Everyone says that sky not stacking the carrots hurt them but what hurt me is that ant called magma blocks magma cubes
Yaaaaasssssss SKY!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Minecraft breaks when it senses the presence of antvenom
Is sky back???? Like actually???
You gotta survive the night

Feels trip time
Sorry im late, just got off school

wicked awseome
It saddens me that adam isnt as hype or as loud as before..... And he doesnt even scream for butter
Rip ShinePhD
Love some hankvenom!!!
Can you do face cam?
Yeah the golden carrots could have been in 1 slot rather than 6 but it‚Äôs alright, you are doing good Adam
I like how there are only 11 haters XD
How are you doing Adam?
OMG, he's back, Yeah!
Sky are you ok you didn‚Äôt sound happy still a great video though just making sure you‚Äôre OK
me watching sky not star golden carrots:  adam
now play SMP live
Thanks Adam ‚ù§
1)you didn‚Äôt stack the golden carrots.         2)you missed some lapis.                        3)that flower you saw was in the woods in ep.1
Adam do viedoes with facecam
In the first episode adam hit his head on lapis.
THE CARROTS
Intro makes me cry
Imagine sky playing in smp
Love u adam
2:51 - i have 24 karat
I haven‚Äôt watched you since I was 11 damn memories
insert joke about Butter Carrots here
He walked past a hole that had lava in it and was a block deep at 19:07
It‚Äôs a series!!!
can you play with ross and barny
I'm just waiting for the moment when Sky gazes upon a woodland mansion
what madlads they found diamonds
Wasn't there lapis in their dungeon base
4:34 Antbrine
"wow this was nostalgic"
First or second or fifth idk
Oh no he found the butter
1.14!!!
9:40 - You actually only need 10 obsidian for a nether portal. If you want it to look beautiful, then do 14. Otherwise, just get 10 and use four other blocks for the corners
omg so awesum do more pls
This series is good
where's jschlatt to take you to the end
After being a sub since 2009(give or take) i am only just now realizing both Sky and Ant have the same amulet
Its gonna bug me all day when ant used iron ore for waste block. dont know if he ran out of stone, or just panicked, but still.
BUUUTTTTEEEERRRRR!!
Lol nice good
Now i want him to play with callmecarlson
I feel like everyone is saying it but the carrots stack
Can't wait to see them play 1.14
Do all of you still remember the oldest minecraft survival lets play with this two guys since the beta version? Leave a like if you are.
Adam I recommend you setup camp somewhere down there so you don't lose your spawn area!
I have a feeling adam has auto jump on...
I missed this so much
1st like and view
I‚Äôm sorry but my OCD is at its worst seeing Adams inventory and his HUD , but Atleast he‚Äôs getting better at it
Adam I'm glad u back
Ant is just a mom at this point
Oh the Budder
You guys got a really good seed.
18:07 Nah things just dont show up when u need em
There is Laois by the dungeon where your beds are!!
Play ant farm with him ^
Upgrade to 1.14
Whenever Sky gets hurt or sound like he got hurt Antvenom is always concerned its cute, he's like a mother in minecraft
I been watching sky since a kid best Minecraft creator
Well if only he got the lapis last episode when he was next to it
Waitt... How will sky get copyrigthed if he Made the song hmm..
Ant n sky is so cute
Why does he not remember anything
In the version of Minecraft you are using you need to time your attacks to do damage
It hurts to watch him play
Adam remember ita not gold its budder
glad that you're bacc
I love your vids
Oh damn, we got another Episode 2! Here's to a long series of exploring the wonders of Minecraft!
They added a new update
I might be wrong but adam doesnt sound rly hype playing mc, well at least at this video. I mean, he doesnt look like he even bother to learn
Ahhh he‚Äôs back
Why does he seem so sad and quiet
sky did your brain melt from not playing minecraft for so long what in the hell are you doing
so slow
1 view 59 likes. Yes 100% true. Also, I love this. It gives me so many good memories
2nd
Hell yeah babey
Howdy dody
AntVenom treating you like a noob
he didn't call the gold butter
sky..... tip: don't spam hit, wait for that bar under your crosshair to charge up so you can deal a lot more damage than spamming, they had added that, im sorry to inform you, to prevent multiplayer pvp to be so imbalanced and to make the game just a bit harder, you can do a lot of damage with it being charged all the way
Why didn‚Äôt he say to crouch on the magma blocks
You good man
It pains to see that sword skill spam
FACE CAM FACE CAM
NEXT EPISODE MUST BE FACE CAM
I miss einshine...
why does he sound depressed
Hell yeeeeasss
Yes lads
Let‚Äôs have some fun in Minecraft!!

Ant venom and Sky
I love you sky
Omfg nostalgia
Use facecammmmmm
Communism

Where my butter at?
Sky, buddy, long time fan and sudscriber, but with the auto jump, please turn it off. It has been driving me crazy almost as much as the carrots.
Wo wo wo wo u telling me sky doesn‚Äôt know wat bonemeal is
i think it was a Fortress in a Fortress, thats why the weird generation
4th
The worst part of this was him not knowing how to make paper. The best part is the rest
Inhale Butter carrots
I wish i had a sole
yeah!
Beautiful
antvenom is so patient with him
Yo sky if you hold shift and left click your mouse with food or any type of stuff in MC all of it will be transferred to your inventory if your inventory isnt full
Butter?
i swear i wanted to scream at adam when he wasnt stacking the carrots
What update are they on?
Are you two actually friends because if you two are it doesn‚Äôt seem genuine because you don‚Äôt seem like you care about anything and antvenom seems like he‚Äôs talking just to make things interesting and seems uncomfortable.
Good video
Is it just me or does Adam sound like,,,, tired? I get thats he's been depressed and everything's been going on, but i just wanna make sure he's doin okay. I dont want him playing this if he isnt actually wanting to
Sky Army
Oh wow
28:31 Magma Blocks^ reeee
Hi
Sky's movement is so slow he seems tiered
Damn with sky coming back and yogscast playing minecraft again, it's so nostalgic <3
üëç
he is not having fun at all
Kinda hurts when he did not stack the carrots but its ok
Adam call gold butter
He went back to minecraft?
Noice
Let‚Äôs throw Adam into 2b2t and just see what happens
YEET!!
hOI! :‚Ä¢3
They have a lapiz at their base
Why does sky sound so dead inside
Adam!!
food does stack except the cakes xD 
also you have to wai atleast 1 second before attacking with sword
2 for axes
axes deal more damage than sword
but a maxed enchanted sword deals more damage than axe
you can jump and wait for you to go down then strike for a critical
Auto jump is messing with him
Hang in there man..
Ayyy
You sound so bored Adam
I remember that song to
how do u guys play together lol
yeah 90
Adam toe reveal? Face reveals are the things of the past.
I use to watch sky  when i was like 6 and now because his playing minecarft again i started playing it again
<3
Omg hes back
yay adam!
No you
Hey
Is this old or new?
Hey guys Hankvenom here.
you can stack everthing except for shields, tools, cake, water buckets, lava buckets, and milk buckets. that's what I remember rn
Yeeeeeetttt
We love you sky ü§ó
what happened to netnobody
Hey Btw You can stack the golden carrots Adam/sky
Why does sky sound so depressed üòîüòî

Also sky you can hold all the golden carrots together

How‚Äôs life
Splunking
Wuuuuuu
Yas
i didnt came back science i was 9 and i didnt even knew english i was just a kid that enjoyed seeing a guy playing minecraft. now im 14 i totally understand you guys and im glad i came back
God I remember being in 3rd and 4th grade, and rushing to grab my iPod touch to watch your videos and antvenoms 4 pillars skyblock. My old Minecraft username was ‚Äúbutterprincess4‚Äù because I love your content so much. In 4th grade my biggest dream was meeting you. Your such a cool person and so important to so many of us. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back :)
You Humans are ridiculous
Are you gonna restart the series since the new update just came out? There is not really that much progress so it would make sense considering it is such an impactful update
Bruh
Yeet
Interesting fact, 1 block in the nether is 8 in the overworld
SKYYY! You keep forgetting to space your sword attacks out. You're just spamming it. Watch the sword under your crosshairs after you swing, so you know when you can do full damage again
Sky ur soo cooool
Remember the mod reviews? Those were the days.
I think next time Adam should learn more about inventory management, oh and also please rewind the combat lessons (DONT SPAM CLICK!!) anyways love the nostalgic feeling Sky!!
Still spam clicking I see
Sky your cool
Cant wait till u r back to being a Minecraft Master
Sky does Minecraft
What happen to butter
More
Loooloolo
yay
Is this a new Minecraft video or reupload
Sky u can stack items
Stop spam clicking during pvp
Sky are you ok you sound depressed
Ye ye
Nice
Nice
Nice
These aren‚Äôt uploaded often but when they are it‚Äôs like Christmas
Sky is still spam clicking. Old habits die hard I gurss
At 22:42 I thought you were going ting the parody you song with Kermit.
Ermagerd Adam stack the butter carrots -_-
geoff
At 19:28, When that creeper exploded onto Adam's shield, I heard a note block.
hi
Cue the Captain Sparklez Minecraft parody playlist
Lapis is also used to die stuff like wool, clay, cement, terracotta, dog and cat collars, etc. Its actually more useful than you think :)

EDIT: lapis is useless except for enchanting, thats so ridiculous XD
Sky is back?
Hulk dies in endgame
Oh no i'm getting sucked back into Minecraft i can't believe this is happening
Yay!
BRING BACK MINEPRANKS !! (That would be cool, but you don‚Äôt have too)
Why does he sound stoned?
You sound dead inside
He still makes minecarft videos? I thought he stopped
First
Am I dreaming? Is he actually back on Minecraft and will he join smp with antvenom
Does sky hate his life? Yes, yes he does.
Wow you found diamonds on the day of my birthday sweet.
Are you okay?
Play with sparklez
What up Hank-Venom
Adam, go into controls and disable "Auto-Jump". It should make your minecraft life much much easier.
FIRST
I know I‚Äôm not the first person to say this but wow.  Watching sky play Minecraft has rekindled me to play it myself.  You‚Äôve really brought my childhood bad so thanks Adam <3
I feel like I‚Äôm back in 2012 again, and I love it
I thought this would never happen... a crossover with 2 underappreciated youtubers!
Ye ye plz no end game spoilers

Budder
Adam why didn‚Äôt you stack the golden carrots üòë I‚Äôm sorry bro but it hurts
Are these just reuploads ?
Didn't you stop post minecraft? Or did you P.S. This sends me back so far I love your music and gameplay
Anyone get reminded of Blake Shelton by Adam? I mean the voice, his singing, he kinda looks like him.
Sky needs to do mod showcase and epic jump maps again
After being a sub since 2009(give or take) i am only just now realizing both Sky and Ant have the same amulet
Budder
Said he was done with Minecraft hence the name change, now he is back to Minecraft. Youtubers fake as usual.
MINECRAFT IS COOL!!
Sky no... This is not alpha lol
20:15 "can i tp to you" oh my god that was so nostalgic
Im sorry, but i can't go back to calling him sky...its now just adam.
Sky shouldn't say gold, ever, hes a Butter man, BRING BACK THE BUTTER
Sky i wud like to play with you i have 5 years of playing minecraft i now ever thing!!!! And you help me get through some rough times so thank you
AntVenom is like the last Minecraft Avenger and Sky wants to go back to the team
Jesus Sky you‚Äôre so old school. You can stack food.
You NEED to join CallmeCarson‚Äôs server. That‚Äôs something I really need to see.
D-D-D-DIAMONDS?!
Skydoesminecraft is back! And he is kicking ass and taking names with AntVenom! The best thing ever!
It seems so obvious he isnt happy playing this anymore. I really dont understand why people are congratulating him.
Who else was here when he had 12,000 subs? Only me? Sky is amazing now he has 11 Million subscribers?!?! Love you sky you have made my childhood better.
Are you guys playing in 1.14? If so poor adam. Trying to learn Minecraft and in the middle Minecraft updates XD
PEPE
Ye
Woo I‚Äôm here early
Auto jump off plzz
Please change the name back to skydoesminecraft please
Hey Sky, lately I have noticed that you seem very sad, or unhappy about that the content you‚Äôre making. Thank you for giving us this nostalgic feeling we all so needed, but do what‚Äôs best for you. Make the content you want to make. Don‚Äôt force yourself to play a game you don‚Äôt want to play.
2015 will never end will it
This brought me back to the FNAF days and childhood was innocent. Life was 'simple' back then and we didn't have to convince yourself that you're happy. Welcome back Adam we've missed you.
Antvenom sounds like a literal tutorial Npc he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou could place the nether portal right here if you want‚Äù ‚ÄúWould you like to craft the enchantment table‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you would like we could search for lapis now‚Äù
Sky needs to turn off autojump, learn the combat, fix that resolution is your monitor like 800x600?
I‚Äôm pretty sure the village had a blacksmith.
27:06 OF COURSE THEYRE STACKABLE
(at least he stacked them EVENTUALLY)
Why does sky sound so depressed
Bet
So wait, I‚Äôm a little late to this, is he back?
First
I thought u are good at minecrart
Sky one punch man has a season two it's already out
I know that you‚Äôre just being yourself and all, but the least you could do is talk a little more. What happened?
You should play on CallMeCarson's minecraft server
Man, Sky used to be a pro in Minecraft! What happened to him?
jesus christ how did he become such a noob.....
Play with captainsparklez please :(
Sky I love your vids thank you for all your hard work and I want to say thanks for those lives where you just talk cause I have been to 8 different therapist and I'm see one now and I'm only 14 and how you expressed your feeling it made feel that I could to. So thanks and your are the OG of Minecraft
Aw man, if only he would scream "BUTTER!!!" like he used too.
well because your name is now sky does everything can we hope to see a fortnite vid in the future?
GIMME HEART IM FIEST ADMAN
Roblox is better because micheal myers has raygun

i just want to say this but i grew up watching sky does minecraft   tbh i actually  cried when u stop making these special videos i have had alot of depression with out u but now that ur back ive been alot better i just want to say i love u man u alway will have a special place in my heart
Oh my God my small heart the memories thank you so much sky you seem so much happier. My first video was in your epic jump map days, it was a Christmas adventure map with Deadlox where you fought zombies and still cursed. I was something like 8 years old and this is such a throwback to the good old days (from there I was a fan until your final videos) and it just makes me so happy to see you back at it. Assuming you still have dogs, give them some good boy pats for me?(if you don't still have dogs pat Galleleo or Jet)

-Elizabeth, 14 from NJ
happiness noise

He was just trying to get avengers endgame into the title

Let‚Äôs get him to 13 million subscribers
I do wanna say that the whole icon introduction in the mouse thing pointing everyone out is super unnecessary. I don't know why but it just bugs me a tiny bit. We can understand what's going on, even if it takes a little, especially if they have seen this kinda thing before.
Sky is back!
Yay!!!!!!!
#thebutterkingisback
I just watched a old vid an found out what happened in sky‚Äôs life feels bad manüò¶üò¢
Nostalgic
Child hood re made
:)
I‚Äôm gonna cry
I feel like a kid again
Sky Army
Cops and Robbers was my absolute favorite when I was little... If it wasn't for that series, I don't think I would have gotten into Minecraft. I wish you well on your treatment, Sky! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nostalgia
my childhood just said hi
Holy cow! I've been waiting (how long since the last cops and robber?) Man remember when Jerome found that the  Creepers puff up and don't explode.
Sky made the army but Adam made the nation.
To all those eight people whom disliked this video shall die in the endgame
Omg it‚Äôs 2011
I see that going back to the old style seems to be making you way happier, good to see that. Also it‚Äôs cool to see that a lot of the old gangs back together
I must say... from being a dumb 7 year old on youtube and watching your first mod review, to when you announced quitting minecraft, having 3 channels and this one to now... its so weird but amazing that your name is now SkydoesEverything... as thanos once said "this does... put a smile on my face" i think that was a quotw from infinity war
Where is red
Hell yeah old school Sky
Can you do vids with ROSS ü§™ plz
Account
:)
my NOSTALGIA
I thought I was 10 years old again i-
Wow does this bring back memories or what
My childhood i mean im just a teen but still these were the days that would make my days a lot more better
Am I still watching Minecraft videos at 16? Yeah
He's baaaaaaaackkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
maybe minecraft is the cure to your deppression
Ahhhh NOSTALGIAAAAAAA
You could take the prison and turn it into a club! Something with the word "Ice" in it...
Is their spoilers in this vid
Was anyone a kid when sky started posting and come back as an adult
Sky is the reason I discovered and played minecraft, he is also one of the biggest reasons I left the game, now he might be the reason I wanna  buy it again for nostalgia sake üòÇ My Childhoodd!!
It‚Äôs cool I get to see him making videos and seems to be happy
I don‚Äôt even care if I‚Äôm a teenager now I‚Äôm still watching this üòÇüòÇ
sees 12 dislikes on the video
‚ÄúWelp, guess it‚Äôs time for 12 counts of murder‚Äù
I'm glad you're well enough to do this video! I missed this so much and I hope your treatment is doing well! Love you and your videos!
I dont know how long its been. I just know that when I was little, my dad would bring his laptop from work back home, and when he was in the gym from 7 to 9 he would sometimes let me use his laptop and i would watch your vids man. Now im 18, almost 19, cant belive im excited for a new cops and robbers video after all those years
This makes me happt
never thought I‚Äôd see the return...
Omg spoilers üò°üò°

i'll be honest, i am glad that there is still two other original "Crafted" people who still plays with sky, i mean i know Husky Mudkips became Doktor Q and all, but still.

I know Sky will probably never see my comment but if he does I just want to thank him for giving me a childhood I can remember.  You will always be #1 in my heart!

Iron man dies
Holy crap this is exactly like your old videos and you seem more excited, loose, funny, and all over the place like the Adam I know and love I hope the rest of your videos are exactly like this and if you don't make more cops and robbers I will find your location and nibble on your intestines.
Wow what has happened to the sky i remembered. The first video I watched about sky was one with him smoking and talking about his divorceüòûüòûüò´what happened to sky: rip skydoesminecraft
My god it feels like I‚Äôm back in 2013
I have been watching sky for about 6 years now and I think that this video is very different then sky‚Äôs other cops and robbers videos then I noticed something. No Ross, no Max and no Barney. It came to my attention a long while back that Max and Sky were splitting up and no longer friends. But where do Barney and Ross stand on this?
my childhood
Hey sky I‚Äôm HowToBasic
Only Og fans remember this




Butter
THAY'RE BACK!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
Adam, you probably won't find this, but I cant express how happy I am that you're back. <3
meIN chiLdhOod
Oh my God he did it but I prefer the whole gang
YES
Where‚Äôd facecam go!?!?
Every Time Adam uploads more Minecraft video's I Almost Begin to cry. Almost every person That did Minecraft before big youtubers like Crainer Ssundee, and name a lot of others became click baiting and making nothing BUT fortnight video's completely Forgetting the Community they Grew so popular from an Abusing that Community's popularity to only boost there views in the long run... I know People in the youtube Career need to make money an that's off views some how.... But the way they left the Minecraft community they created of there channels was down right Stingy and heartless. The stuff adam has done for this community after all he has gone through with the community of this game an people. . .  well.... lets just say if he isn't a prime Example of a Person that truly cares about there Viewers an the Community they grew from and around... then I don't know what does. 
Thank you Adam. You keep My child hood Alive! 
(Disclaimer I don't dislike any youtubers I mentioned rudely . I dislike there actions.)
I love how Adam is makin Minecraft videos now but he doesn't seem as i should say funny, loud, and the excitement and laugh at any stupid joke that his friend or he made but I love u Adam

Skyarmy aghaghaghagh
I don‚Äôt know if people will see this, but seeing all the old creators coming back, or those who have been gone for months or years who finally post something is heart warming, and the nostalgia that comes with it is amazing. Sky/Adam, it‚Äôs wonderful to see you posting videos again. I remember the old times where Minecraft was in the simpler times before the combat update, where hunger game servers were plentiful, where Skype was the bridge between communication of friends, and waking up as a little kid to see Minecraft videos on channels like yours, Jerome‚Äôs, Captainsparkelz, Mitch‚Äôs, Ashlee Marie, and others brought countless hours of summer so much entertainment. Thank you for so much joy and entertainment and keep up the good work.
It's like I'm a kid again...
Genuinely for as long as I can remember I've watched you and you're such an inspiration hope ya feeling better now, thanks a ton for just doing this and bringing back some good memories.
THE INTRO I am crying I miss you ADAM

When I first watched your videos till you retired I was like "Who's the guy with the funny voice?"
Watching this just brings so much nostalgia of when I was 8, going onto YouTube, watching so many of Adam's videos, and enjoying every minute

Now i'm in high school and doing the same thing. Somethings never change I guess!
0:49 I always thought that adam would‚Äôve been an earth pony or an alicorn but hey, pegasus is fine too XD
I'm so happy to hear you laughing sky I hope you're getting the help you need keep strong for the butter Army

Any updates on when all the sky vs gaming stuff will be re uploaded?
U are a REAL hero and dont let anybody make u think anything other
You sound back like yourself love you man
All the heros have a special place in my heart, but some of my top ones have to be Scarlet Witch, Black Panther and Dr.Strange!üòè

The Intro.
Seeing an actual Minecraft youtuber that shows quality and dominance against others.
Some old pals.

Adam/sky is my favorite hero, he brightens up my day in the worst moments, he is a down to heart nice guy I've never given up on, he tries to make everyone else happy before himself sometimes, I think I may have multiple personalities, he has always been there and is great, Adam is and always be one of my heroes

When I heard his voice happy, I instantly sprayed my gamer goo
For those that dont  know the song is Ark by Ship Wrek
i'm so happy to see you playing minecraft again after all this time. i've been watching since i was in middle school; during that time I was so excited to watch a video of yours every day when i got home.

I guess he couldn‚Äôt find his newest intro or did u just not want it
I used to watch him in my tweens alot
Yay he's sounds happy
Sky army all the wayyyyy
Batman!
Sky has been through so much these last few years. And I haven't seen his videos since the 10th try not to laugh. Or even the whole team crafted stuff. I veered off to watch other people's videos and sometime occasionally I come back. I'm 16 yo and I remember sky's old survival series from machinima  and got upset when he only got to the point of getting an eye of ender and find the dungeon. I was around 9 or 10 idr. But seeing sky now makes me think about how old I've gotten and how not only my mind but my sense of humor. And also how much sky has changed. I hope he loves this series as much as i do because i stopped playing after 2015 and just recently got back into it
yeet
I still can‚Äôt believe that he‚Äôs back
I think sky should just play adventure maps with his friends
0:48 is sky a brony now?
Where‚Äôs truemu

Favorite superhero: Adam
My favorite super hero is the mighty BACON MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you going to play with ross
"Many years ago, there was an army. A army like no other, the Sky army. No one came close to even being equal to this superior army. But one dark day the king abandoned his throne outta no where. The army was confused. More confused than when the pack split. The army was lost, Jerome fell off... As well as the others, but there was still hope. The last survivor of the pack Ssundee. He stayed true to his Minecraft army untill fortnite took over. Ssundee was quick to abandon the dying Minecraft game. With no one in the pack that was keeping minecraft alive, the king returned. Hopefully to bring the pack back. 
Damn budderss
Adam, I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre back! I know you‚Äôve been going through a lot lately and hope you‚Äôre getting by at least. I‚Äôd really love an update about your old friends (max, Barney, Ross, Jess, etc.) It‚Äôd also be amazing to go back to gta v every now and again. I love what you do and hope you never stop! I‚Äôve been watching you since I was 6 and hope your life falls back into place. I love you so much! -Isaac
Saber yeesssss
Adam sounds so happy and interested! Yay ^-^ I hope you aren't like acting or anything, I hope you're really happy!
where is ross?
Deadpool is my favorite
All u need now is Mitch
Nobody gonna mention the pony sky?
Its been 300 years
It feels like Sky has started to bounce back to his old self, from the editing to the whole vibe feeling like he's more happy to be doing this and enjoying it. Glad to see Adam is doing better and I've been a fan for a while now and it really feels like he has grown but is regaining his old attitude as in enjoying it all. Sorry for the repetition just wanted to throw that out there
I like that he's playing video games again but after he left lots of his fanbase left because he wasn't gonna upload anymore so getting everyone back is gonna be really hard to do
ROSS TIME
NAH BATMAN BETTER THAN SUPERMAN SNARL
Adam! Minecraft! My life is life!

no, arachnids are a separate group from insects that's main role in the ecosystem is to make sure the insect population doesn't grow too large while getting tons of food in the process. they are basically the capitalists of nature, where they found a problem and they are fixing it while making a profit of sorts

Sky back to his old self- but hopefully much happier with himself and comfortable in his body and mind than before! I love you Sky üíïüíï I know you‚Äôre getting hundreds of comments saying we support you and love you, but I hope you understand that we mean it- we‚Äôre not just saying it because you‚Äôre famous, we‚Äôre saying it because you‚Äôre our childhood, our role model, our idol, and someone we care about deeply. A lot of us were pulled out of bad thoughts by your videos and found great comfort in them, and I hope we can return the favor for you. Stay strong Sky, and us recruits stay strong too!!!
This makes both happy and sad

they canceled daredevil because disney didn't want to seem like they were condoning the violence in the show. daredevil was the most viewed show out of all of them. they were making enough money, it's just that since disney owns marvel, disney canceled the show

2023?
Still can‚Äôt get over the nostalgia that intro brings dang
This makes me happy...
my favorite superhero is you Adam
I saw this when I was watching and old video of his and I thought it was from awhile ago and I found it it was 30 mins ago I‚Äôm so happy he is laughing and happy
Too bad ssundee is stuck in fortnite views land
Spoodermans
Ay I don‚Äôt know if you read these but can I just ask if you can bring bedwars w/ red back? And the like goal of 2 likes so absolutely nothing can happen???
All time best superhero to me is spoderman
VERY NICE VIDEO
So happy your enjoying your time during this vid 







Also my favourite hero is black panther
the second jerome starts flying as the goat, my youtube crashes XD
Youtube wants us to exercise by clicking 2 times
Pure evil
Will Adam ever do facecam again
IT SOUNDS LIKE HIS OLD MIC DUDE
My childhood is coming back and it‚Äôs great and the intro brings back memories
SKY AND THE FLUFFY BACK TOGETHER YAYAYAYYAA
Yes, all the yes
My favorite superhero is the flash and great video
My childhood memories are pouring in TTT~~TTTTTT
Sky you should do mod reviews, I missed those so much!
I thought you were finished
I‚Äôm just waiting for prison break and almost everything will be back to normal
I like Dr.Strange
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It seems like the old you back when you first started playing minecraft
<3
plz bring back ssundee with you too
Cant believe your not doing Minecraft videos with YourPalRoss, Mithzan or ThatGuyBarney the old skyarmy
Keemstar is my favourite superhero
Hey sky play a minecraft parkour map with deadlox plss
Im glad sky actually laughed very hard and is happy like the good days
Black panther is my favorite hero
Who else got a Avengers Endgame ad
Great video reminds me of the old days
It's like the good ol days
Good 2 c u back m8
Love the vids
Loveeeeee youuuuuuu pls senpai like mee
I missed this :)
834 liked Yaya
i'll forever support you
hOI! :‚Ä¢3
This made me so happy to watch
He has been reborn
Play with ross again
Anyone have any intel on the squids? They‚Äôve been quite for a while and that‚Äôs a little suspicious those mollusks are up to something
i love how he is making videos again for minecraft. possibly the only original minecrafter who didnt go to fortnite COUGH COUGH SSundee
Spider-Man
Spiders are arachnids
Me, seeing the thumbnail- GASP! its them boiz!
Been here for five years and that intro still makes me smile. You bring much joy and gave me great memories.
Our god Adam has returned with GOOD content?
Can There Be A Letsplay Series Of Minecraft With Everyone?
Sky is back!!!! This is the best birthday gift ever
Minecraft if back on the up!
i loved this video so much!!
please don't use the same song over and over, gets kind of annoying after a while, but glad to see you're back üëç
I grew up watching your old minecraft hide & seek vids so this is nostalgic.
its weird to watch this now that im older..
Welcome back Adam
I wonder what happened to Bashurvurse I hope he is still alive and well he was so sad and broken last time he uploaded before he went
Who else wants Ross back
How's the nugget doing adam
A new. Do not laugh maybe?
If Spider-Man isn't your favorite superhero...what are you even doing? Also, I hate people not knowing what the heck an insect actually is. Insects have 6 legs, arachnids have 8, arthropods (bugs) are a blanket statement for insects, arachnids, and more.
Spiderman and Deadpool are my favorite Super Heroes
Where's ross, barney, max, and aphmau... THE OG SQUAD!!!!!!
7 year old me is crying. How come I am now finding out he made a comeback with Minecraft and he‚Äôs with some old pals.
Spiderman is my fav
it‚Äôs been so long since i‚Äôve heard Adam laugh like this. OMGGGGGGGG HE LOOK LIKE A WHOLE SNACCCCCC ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§
Toody sounds like galexy Steve from the Steve saga. Like if u agree.
Top 10 anime characters that got revived
You sound so happy! It makes me smile that you actually sound happy again üòÜ‚ù§
I love all of the videos he has started making, he sounds so much better and seems like he's actually happier! Which makes me happy for him!
who else saw this and was like "YES he brought it back"
Its good seeing you laugh
This really made my day seeing the intro made me smile and I am happy to see your back and if people say they want you to go back do what you want because all of us are happy if your happy
He sounds desperate, but all better in terms of his recent depression
I LOVE TO SEE YOU BACK SKYDOSEMINECRAFT
I use to watch this guy when l was 10
do modded hunger games
Yes
An insect has only 6 legs. Arachnids have 8
<33
This video is MMMMMMMMMMMMMM delicious
I‚Äôm glad sky is back he was my childhood
Spider man for da win
What happened to brotato?
Spider man
Only true fans remember..






budder
Adam sounds so dead while Jerome is like the super active friend that keeps stuff alive
I'm so glad that Adam is back. He was a huge part of my childhood and growing up, and I'm happy to watch him, now that I've grown up and changed.
Jerome:YOU JUST MADE 3 MILLION DOLLARS
Sky:yes
For those saying Adam sounds depressed:
Adam is much less energetic because he is no longer playing up his role as an entertainer, he's just having some fun with a friend. If you remember some of his earliest videos Adam sounded kind of similar. He also might very well be a bit depressed, his life has been a bit rocky for the past few years. Or he's just really high. The point is it's more than just him being depressed.
Damn am I 12 again??
Hey




I love u. I don't want a like. I just love you for hitting 
Only real fans remember Epic Jump Maps and ‚ÄúJason I‚Äôm startled‚Äù
Multiple Minecraft series at once what a time to be alive
Who else instantly clicked the video when they got the notification?? Because I did!!
Jerome talks a lot and I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the time you don‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs saying, lol







(Jerome is me all the time)
i cant really enjoy the video with adam sounding so down :c
Do what you love, man. 
"You do you. I'll do me. And we won't do each other...


Probably."
Adam sounds so freaking depressed (;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂–î‡ºé‡∫∂`) Poor Adam 
Don't want him doing things he doesn't wanna do :(
He's starting to sound better. I think he's healing!üôÇ
Dude the feels...... 







THE FEELS (‡≤• Õú ñ‡≤•)
I LOVE YOU. will the adam see this?
The tragic moment that when you realize when Adam is back, he will have to leave again.
Hey Adam bruh thanks for bringing back your YouTube for the longest time I‚Äôve been struggling with prescriptions and i feel you bro do your best
The memories are real
That intro just BROUGHT MEEEE BACKKKKKK
y Adams seem so uninterested ü§£
What is this feeling, my heart when I heard and saw that iconic intro‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Sky‚Äôs silver lining of his depressive voice is it makes funny moments better
It‚Äôs a good thing he has help :)
damn , I can't feel anything good because sky's voice sounds so depressed right now

Question
AWE  ^-^ !! THE INTROO
Who remembers JASON IM STARTLED
Adam Man U don‚Äôt sound the same I still love your vids
My childhood has been revived and I just had so many flashbacks seeing that intro
Aaah
I remember watching gudol sky  old vids
You should make an automatic suger cane farm with pistols and observers they work really well
First time clicking on one of ur minecraft vids and hearing that intro gave me so much nostalgia
OMGGGG The nostalgia is coming back. It feels like PTSD
Who remembers minecraft universe and deadlox in the mario mapüòÇüòÇ
Every video sky is gaining evey power that he lost
Adam im happy your back and your ok, btw the content makes me feel like the old you is coming back out... Its nice I like it
Came here from instagram üëåüòé
Jerome is like a hyped up announcer for a game show,
then Sky just sounds like he high a few hours ago and was finally out of that state.
I'm loving this series
I remember the intro since prison break and his older video
2013 Adam: very hyper and loud

2019 Adam : very quite and sounds sad
you sound like your VERY old videos
with your monotone voice

"i am very excited"in a very montone voice
Yo Adam I haven‚Äôt watched your stuff in like four years and then I was going through my saved videos and found an old cops and robbers video and now I can‚Äôt stop watching your videos so keep it up manüëç
I thought he left to do music or something...

Welcome back
Squids and budder

Sky:What‚Äôs that?
I love that thumb nail also I hope you doing well
Being for real Adam, love you man.
When I was first going through youtube (2011) on my mobile boostmobile phone from my mom that ran every video at 144p. I could not read what the chat said.

Now I can read the chat and that's pretty cool.
It hurts to hear Adam like this. He is such a good person he doesn‚Äôt deserve depression
Sky I love you when I was 10 I loved Ross and Jim and youüò≠ so pls BRing back try not to laugh gta and team crafted so pls if you see this do this and I love your diss track on KSI
ADAM you are the best i love your videos i watch them when i‚Äôm upset because you are so funny and make my day i hope you see this and again your the best!
I love that sky is back BUT his enthusiasm has gone down......Jerome is like LOOK A RABIT!!!!!!!......and sky is like....ye

Edit still love your vids
Is it just me or is he genuinely getting happy then remembers he has to be Monotone so he switches?  
It‚Äôs getting better with each episode üëèüèª

When Adam left, I was a little heart broken. I watched all of his videos no matter what was going on in my life and to see him come back..... I was so happy.  Thanks Adam for being my childhood!
Who remembers "DONT LOOK AT MEEEEEH"
Is it just me, or does Adam seem happier with every recording.

Hi army
Love you Adam! I hope treatment is going well for your depression, don't forget to take breaks from social media cause it can be a bit toxic and surround yourself with loved ones :)
Hey Adam, I just wanted to let you know that I love your videos. They helped me through some hard times in my life. But just was wondering if you really wanted to make this video. You sound drained. Remember to just be who you are. Make what you want to make. Thank you for all the laughs.
I honestly feel like Adam was high while recording
Every time I watch one of his new videos I feel like I went back in timeüòÇüòÇ
You and mumbo uploaded at the same time btw

Yo sky I love you man good to see your back

fIrSt 




Ffs Grow Up
The Intro brought tears of joy to me.
Yesterday, I had a sandwich, and it was really good!
What is going on with the quality of the vid ??
You da pro Man :D
Adam still sounds kind of unenthusiastic. Don't want the guy to do something he isn't into.
He sonda so deppressedüòÇbut Its Also sad
Yes he is back but he isn‚Äôt hype as before
I‚Äôm glad to see you making content again. I‚Äôm enjoying it very much and it‚Äôs bringing good nostalgic feels. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Sky doesn‚Äôt carry the same energy as he used to :(
adam still has the same voice from 5 years ago üò≥
Damn, your views per subscribers is saddening.
Wait. You started uploading again? Huh. Neat.
THE THUMBNAIL LOOKS SO 2013 AND I LOVE ITTTTTT
Hey why do the videos sometimes feel so awkward üòÇüòÇ be u bro no need for unnecessary chuckles
I love Sky just saying ‚ÄúI have a mooshroom‚Äù
whoa fever dream
Hopefully sky feels better and gets over his depression
Mhmm Mhmm
I'm sorry, but there was no heart in this, this was a forced video.
Sky is gone.....
ADAM IVE MISSED YOUU
God, the nostalgia is just, almost painful. I love it
In the beginning Jerome sounded like a real life ad
are these pre-rehab videos because you sound so freakin sad my guy
I love these piles make more! Of course if you have the time too :)
Adam if you see this just wanted to say I‚Äôm proud of you that you‚Äôre being yourself and ain‚Äôt afraid to talk about what‚Äôs been going on and just want to have fun and just enjoy yourself proud of you dude even if you don‚Äôt play Minecraft or not I‚Äôm just glad you are still being a humble kind person and keep being that humble kind person!

Just want this to be short and sweet later Adam!!! üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
I miss the old skydoes Minecraft the funny one
Adam seems lost in what jerome is saying and Jerome is super energy and sky is just enjoying life
Love your vids
Here before 75 views
64th!!
Adam! Ignore this if you get mad at games but if you don‚Äôt play dark souls 3!
Hi Adam!!!
just put emeralds or diamonds in the chests so that you have the valuable ores that you can sell for more.
Lmfaoooooooooooo maybe the music game isn't as easy as he thought?
The rise of a legend
I literally had no idea that sky came back to Minecraft
Sounds like Jerome is trying to sell Adam something
Back with the minecraft bois
True fans get reminded of Island of the Skies when watching stuff like this
YAY ANOTHER VIDEO :D
Your one day late, I guy named camo1234 had a 13 mil bounty on his head, i put 7 mil just because I could xD

I could have cried when I heard that intro. My childhood was flooding back
Hey Adam, how are you? You sound kinda down, I hope everything's going ok, we're all here for you manüíï

I loved the back then where his Minecraft survival lets plays were so silent and it sounded like asmr
Yes yes yes yes yes yes it been so long I need butter
I can see the old Adam play this survival series. He‚Äôs more ‚ÄúOptimistic‚Äù and not ‚ÄúNegitron‚Äù.
Adam you should join callmecarson's minecraft server
Hey sky are you okay
Through the years Jerome had kept his enthusiasm, never slowing down. And Adam gained his enthusiam and went past like a speeding bullet with it, but he hit a wall, now he must regain his momentum. Edit Adam, if you're reading this. Know that there are still some of the Sky Army back from when you first started, they are out here watching, and cheering you on.
Hey adam,I'm glad you're back,I hope you're doing much better and I wish you the best,please keep it up and we are all here for your support!
Back To Basics, Lez Goooooooo
Im so happy ur back to minecraft and i hope you enjoy being here and we still support you all the way :)
Grinders these days vs grinders before with massive towers with large platforms and water flowing to the center. With signs stopping the water and making the mobs drop to their death. 



Only true mincrafters that has the Minecraft childhood remember this
who like minecraft?
Hey adam, you didnt seem too excited this video, if you dont like doing this then dont, you should be doing what you want to do

Adam sounds so depressed,while Jerome is so energetic

Just me or does Adam sound quiet
This makes me sad to hear his voice but happy inside just hearing his voice again
Does Jerome feel kinda like this series is a sponsorship
Change the intro please.
Jerome is really... Excited in this episode.
Why would 6 people dislike üò≠
like if they should make a separate season and they go against waco their to be the better idland
Who else got hit in feels when they saw this
This video hits home. Jerome and Sky just propel me to the state of mind of my 11 year old self
Adam sounds really tired/sad
Yay wen next one
Bruh, u were a huge part of my childhood, bring back Barney, Ross, and red
Ngl Adam sounds a bit high
I hope you are feeling better!
I remember many years ago running into a member of Team Crafted (back when it was still a thing) on some server somewhere, I didn't know who they were but everyone else was freaking out. Glad to see many of the OG minecraft youtubers finally returning, it feels like it's been ages.
We are dedicated once again-
Sky sounds depressed it's making me sad I hope sky goes back to his old commentary voice
Hey man not sound rude but your kinda timid now, not that i mind but i was just gonna say you have all our support, I feel kinda happy though that your posting mc vids I haven‚Äôt caught up on your music vids tho just know skyarmy shall live on ŒøœâŒø i was kinda hoping you could play some other games too if you want though because it would be amazing if you played other games like it would awesome to see your reactions to like horror or fantasy games even strat games can‚Äôt wait for the next vid
aye 250th lol
You sound miserable dude, if you don‚Äôt want to play it man don‚Äôt. Be yourself.

OH the memories
This sound either very unenergetic, scripted or Adam didnt get what was going on.
Adam sounds so depressed playing this game
Is it just me or does jerome sound like he is an ad throughout the video
I haven't watched sky in over 4 years now I do know what has happened in the past 2 years and I don't know if that's what's wrong with him right now because he does not sound happy he seems pretty upset
I find it so funny how quite Adam is and he‚Äôs just kinda there while Jerome is bouncing all over the place it‚Äôs almost like Adam is nervous of messing up
BUDDDERR
Omfg my childhood üòÇ
youtube hasn't been showing me your videos in my recommendations and it pisses me off.
perfect
Hey, I just wanted to say, I love your videos. You are the one who got me into minecraft and I know you are going through some mental health problems right now so I thought you should know that you have helped me with my mental health issues. If you hadn't gotten me into minecraft, I don't know if I would even be here right now. I have met so many people through minecraft and made so many great friends and all this was thanks to you. So thank you, just thought you should know how much of an affect you have had on people
Does anyone remeber TnT?

Why do you sound so depressed üòü
Do not laugh do not laugh
Dont get me wrong i love sky he was a impact in my childhood and im so happy he is back but ibwant his old self like i feel like his enthusiasm is not as big as before
If you do a try not to laugh here's a joke. (In Tony's rap voice) Tony pepperoni spitting fiery tracks, if you cant handle the heat then you better get back.(right after ) so how scales can I set you up for?
He used to be so energetic and so enthusiastic where did I go I still like his content but it makes me sad to not seem so energetic and enthusiastic
Sky if your reading this I just watched the New world song that u made years ago....And I'm happy to say that I grew up watching you Instead of ninja or any fortnite streamer...now day kids would never understand the joy of getting up in the morning to watch your favorite Minecraft YouTuber

I remember watching you when I was 7 and 8 now I'm 13 and and I wish I could go back an relive those happy moments. It was simpler back then. No golden scars just diamond swords. You and Stampy cat where my child hood and I love too see you back up on your feet and living life again.

With out you I would not be who I am today and I'm greatful to say that I an an OG Sky Army Recruit

I love you man...Keep up the good work.

P.s thanks for reading all of that‚ù§
He sub to t-series
make an auto furnace too sky
sky doesnt seem happy
Just saying but this video is an ad for  the server
am i back in 2013?
Sky if your reading this super like it
I thought he stop doing Minecraft
Awesome
Is it just me or does it sound like sky is depperessed
Hi
Hi
Wait is he coming back?!
Hard to think this is NetNobody
Quit sounding so depressed
Can you unprivate your gta videos plz
I still remember the first SkyDoesMinecraft video, my brother was watching one of his prison break videos as he was screaming PIKA PI!! While shooting everyone as the warden
I feel like I‚Äôm 8 again
why is jerome so scripted lmao
please make my childhood again say hey guys sky here
I used to love his videos... And then he completely changed so I think I'm probably going to have to unsub. Been here basically forever and now it's time to let it go. I can no longer watch him, he makes me upset now.
Hi sky
Does this server work on pocket edition
Sky is depressed
The video had 0 dislikes and 452 likes now someone ruined it
the big e
Are you still friends with Ross
I‚Äôm sad modded cops and robbers are funny
I am glad and mad that he came back to Minecraft I will start with why I am glad
He does Minecraft again now 
He still has some of the squad he has in contact
He knows some things with Minecraft still.
Now It‚Äôs for me why I am mad.
He just came back out of no where and plays Minecraft 
The rest of his Minecraft squad do other things except for few.
Skylox will never come back to fandom which won‚Äôt be becoming a ship anymore cause it is dead.
Adam is now learning Minecraft which makes me confused.


Now I am gonna say it, will Try not to laugh Series gonna come back?
13:27 You could see the absolute confusing from Him when the creeper dropped down and didn‚Äôt explode
It‚Äôs 4:30am and I haven‚Äôt watched your videos since Roommates and your Don‚Äôt Laugh series. Now I‚Äôm watching some of videos and having a breakdown from how long it‚Äôs been. I‚Äôm like in seventh grade again. üòÇüòÇ
Im sad hes high while filming this. He's not as funny.
Yo
Welcome back Adam! Wow seeing you and jerome playing minecraft brings back some old good  memories. Nice to see your getting back to your old self again x
ross?
Nice
Hope your whole depression treatment thing goes well, I‚Äôve been supporting you through the phase of only playing mine craft to music and back to mine craft, you just make me laugh and all I can you in return is respect your choices and support you.
ADAM! I love you so much‚ù§ How are you doing?
Why don't you like ssundee
Ah budder
This sounds lame but I‚Äôm watching this video with my dog and his name is cookie so when his name was said in the video he barked LOL
Sky
Sky your amazing youtuber and all but I wish you were the energetic butter loving squid hating daddy we all know I still love the new you tho it‚Äôs kinda cool ig
Skydoesurmom fgt
To everyone saying Adam sounds depressed, it‚Äôs because Adam is no longer playing a character, I believe. It could be his depression, but I think it‚Äôs just how he is. He sounds like this if you watch hid older videos before he started acting
Wait so is this server allowing you to actually craft hoppers??
Adam you sound down 

Are you ok?


Don‚Äôt force yourself to play minecraft if you don‚Äôt enjoy it ok.
its funny to see sky have to re-learn everything and it reminds me of is first Minecraft videos I grew up with
BUDDER
Adam you sound so uninterested
Adam is either uninterested in the game, or doesn't want to seem childish or something while playing the game, and is holding back for some reason.
Hey Adam so um I have bad news so all the squids are back for your budder so pls help
Does Adam need to rest? I can't tell. He doesn't seem like his old self.
Dammit I can't take Adam being so down while Jerome is being so overly upbeat considering none of this is exciting and just because it's "Sky and the fluffy are doing a video" doesn't mean it's going to take me back to when I was a freshman in high school; Sky wasn't depressed, Jerome wasn't so unironically "EPIC," and Minecraft wasn't memed into submission. All I want is some self-awareness with my Minecraft. The REAL comedy is in the irony
Boi
Adam it‚Äôs good to be back
69
Only true fans remember ‚ÄúI had sex with the adidas logo
I just found out in Pewdiepie subreddit that Adam is back.
What the frick sky AND Jerome are actually still doing Minecraft? I‚Äôm suddenly very nostalgic
I‚Äôm just now getting back into Minecraft. Glad I can go on this journey with y‚Äôall.
When ur an army and u see a girl wearing a bts skin üóøüóø20:54
Adam you sound so sad and broken I hope one day you are able to be happy
Skr blook
Why is Adam so depressing now jheez
Adam seems off. I feel bad for him, hes not actin like he used too. Hope he's all good
why is people disliking? you would think that the trolls would stop by now.
Honestly, I'd rather have Adam sound "Depressed" than him being super energetic. I'd hate for Adam to pretend to be happy, I just want him to be him and I'll just be here enjoying the content that he puts out because no matter who he is or how he sounds, he is still a great person.
The video just got to me and there are already like a lot of people good work ‚ù§Ô∏è
NOTICE ME lol hi üòÑ
Cutie
Skyyy since u and a couple YouTubers make videos together still. Would you ever go back to Cops & Robbers? Just for fun like the old times? No role play just fun?
you sound like you are gunna die. stop making minecraft vids if you want, people will move on.
Sky doesn‚Äôt sound the same like other Minecraft videos he sounds boring and not interested anymore
Sky do not laugh again please please please please please please please please everybody liked it so he can start doing it again
It's the daily dislike
Where's my early squad
adam buddy. u ok?
I need people to watch my videos
Sky or Jerome, I am wondering if you can get in contact with the people who can change prices on items to CHANGE THE PRICE ON ROBOTS SO IT WOULD NOT BE USELESS TO GET A ROBOT?!? If you can that would be nice because it‚Äôs really hard to get a robot cause it costs 200k mob tokens and mob tokens to take a long time to get
Sky, you have been a part of every one of your fans childhoods and the main source of our entertainment and happiness. We have all followed you from the beginning and will support you all the way! Thanks so much for sticking with Minecraft, it still will never change after you left your impact upon us.
I know everyone is saying how they can‚Äôt enjoy the video due to Adam sounding ‚Äúdown‚Äù , but for me this makes me happy regardless, Just seeing him play and seeing him getting up and trying to make himself happier that‚Äôs enough for me. It fills me with great happiness just by knowing that he‚Äôs trying to ‚Äúredeem‚Äù or ‚Äútrying to improve himself‚Äù. I realize things may not ever be the same but I‚Äôm okay with that. ^^ The best we can do is give him our full support!
Not being rude but 
You voice needs more hype!!! :*
Watch the intro at 2x speed you won't regret it.
You guys remembered when he called Jerome "fluffy"?
first
I think it‚Äôs not Adam 
I think it‚Äôs that squid Adam from that squid mod he did a long time ago
Since last episode when he saw the BUDDER ore he didn‚Äôt freak out
13th comment let's gooooo (I got the notification while watching one of his old videos lol)
First
Only true fans remember when sky would be recording and Dawn would walk in and talk randomly
First
antvenom and sky, the reunion we didn't deserve 


but the one we needed <3
Sky: learns Minecraft
Sky: leaves Minecraft 
Sky:comes back
"Aw crap here we go again"
I can't tell if he's really chill or experiencing crippling demotivation.
Sky was a legend

Now years later
AntVenom: "I want to find a Wooden Mansion"
Sky: finds Cartographer, says nothing
A whole hour of Sky and Ant playing vanilla Minecraft? Fucking beautiful. Definitely continue this series.
"Don't you mean, *ButterCarrots*"


Will to live has been resorted.
One of the few mc youtubers that haven't succumbed to fortnite. keep up the good content
Adam sounds like he‚Äôs being tortured to play this
Ant: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm betting I‚Äôll find diamonds within the next minute‚Äù

Video ends

Me: 
Sky:Don‚Äôt you mean butter ,dude?
Me (world literally crumbling around me):üòÉ
World:wait stops crumbling
Did he just say butter 
Me:yep
World:*slowly puts its self back together*
Dude, your like to dislike ratio is amazing.  8.2k likes and 43 dislikes. Amazing sky. Keep up the good work!
Thank you, I hate when people make a full set of wooden items.
Star Wars IX: Rise of Sky...







Doesminecraft
Adam just needs to play with jardon + ant venom and the holy trinity will be complete
I like the no face cam it brings me back to the old days idk
Alright, I gotta say it.




Ant is sky‚Äôs Minecraft father figure
Doctor:you have 58 minutes and 29 seconds to live
Me:*watches this video*
He sounds like he doesn‚Äôt have any energy, keep it up sky, your doing great
I missed you guys so much!!! üò≠

Edit: I just saw Adam go ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs turtles‚Äù I just died üòÇ
I thought the day would never come, but now I can re-live my childhood memories with two of the OG MC‚Äôs. Bloody awesome.
1:09 "and whatnot" ahhh I miss that phrase from Ant
The legendary boi has returned...


Remember the good old days? They're back.
Sky: Digs
Sky: Turns Brightness to 100% when it gets dark


Everyone did this, dont lie.
This is one of the greatest videos 2019 has to offer.
i've been waching sky since 2014 :')
Ant: it'll show you the recipe for glass

Me: but glass is smelted in a furnace.
Will sky start his squid murder spree again?
28:14 yup. he said the b word. he's back.
Sky is back. Thank Ant for teaching him some new bases. Also there is an update where you go on a water adventure, an under water temple. Some of them has really great stuff. In one chest I found 5 diamonds. Thhere are ship wrecks, temples, and other stuff that has chests under water. Would you consider taking an adventure like that?
Sky: Also I think if you combine bone meal with any wool, it turn into white wool.
Gold dude? Don‚Äôt you mean... BUDDER
I‚Äôm crying
ant and sky: finds horses, 3 ravines, a village, and a dungeon in a new world

me: finally finds coal after 4 nights of using charcoal
A anybody else happy at that sky still calls it a cavern instead of a cave
>They have a long conversation about the new combat mechanics
>Immediately forgets and spam clicks his sword
Sky, always asking the hardest questions..
"You think they will ever add cooked beetroot?"
Antivenom: -_-
I‚Äôve watched him since I think I was like 5-7 ._.
How the years have gone by
;-;
so i grew out of that kid friendly content phase but this is REALLY nostalgic and good
We need to gather all the other infinity youtubers and make the ultimate Minecraft comeback
"You will be able to tame foxes though"
YOU FOOL
26:38 ‚Äúthis guy lives in water‚Äù
That was so dumb but I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. That‚Äôs like the classic Sky humor. Glad you‚Äôre back, dude. üíõ
WHO ARE YOU?!?!?! The sky and ant I knew died long ago! I knew the old days will never come back.
and... I'm glad I was wrong.
he protec
he attac
but most importantly


sky and ant are bacc
I love how my fps keeps dropping to 360 and the video keeps buffering..just like old times. :')
Watching this at 1am. This makes me feel like I'm 12 again watching you play Minecraft.
Help. I need help. Save me. 

he acted so bland I swear
Sky and AntVenom should both join Carson's SMP once Sky relearns
My boi is back
He's gone through Hell both figuratively, and literally
And has emerged from the darkest times in his life, just like I knew he would
He's truly a fighter, and an inspiration
He's a survivor, both to real life and in Minecraft
I hope I get to meet him one day
Thanks for being you Adam (Sky)
29:06 I smiled so much hearing sky‚Äôs reaction it‚Äôs the start of him getting some enthusiasm back!
‚ÄúOur potatoes what the heck man?!?‚Äù
antvenom: SHEILDS ARE INSANE


sky:ok


what timeline are we in
Sky sounds so dead when hes talking normally oml im not used to it
Glad your closest and oldest friends are standing with you in your time if need. This is probably the most beautiful videos I've ever seen and im legitimately tearing up thinking that I watched you 5 years ago all the time and ended up losing your content before everything happened. You've impacted my life so much and i thank you for that.
U can see how supportive ant venom is behind the camera when sky made the vegan joke he was still supportive even tho he knew it would be so hard he would still do it for him love you guys keep going strong skyarmy forever
It's great that you're doing minecraft videos again so take your time and don't get too stressed out buddy
Ok this is like me teaching my dad how to Minecraft but sky is better than him üòÇ
He's vegan now!? Huh. What's it like?
WHY ARE YOU SUBSCRIBED TO T-SERIES?!
Holy fucc it's been forever since I've seen you play MineCraft, or basically a single Minecraft...
Sky still played minecraft when the combat update came didn't he?
I don't remember exactly what glacier was but hearing the name was such a weird feeling, like 7,8 year old memories being triggered for the first time.
So long since I've seen that "SkyDoesMinecraft" logo
"My gut instinct is over he-"

"Can you tame the turtles?"
Ant is the expert and Adam is the good luck charm
At what time did he say gold instead of butter
Nostalgia hit me harder than how much of a hit Despacito was.
It's been some time damn do long I was watching for a long time then moved to other youtuber now coming back it's like a newly refreshed youtuber
Ant is such a sweet guy, I'm so glad he's helping Adam out and it's really heartwarming.
One time I found diamonds then walked a little bit to the left and found more diamonds I am your god
I'm glad you played with ptc
I actually cried while watching this. God how I missed this.
everyone just got flashbacks to 2012
Beautiful. Cried tears of happiness. So glad it says episode 1 because hopefully they‚Äôll be more
Ant: I think we've been going for something like 26-27 minutes.. something like that

Me: checks the time of the video only to see 42:16 . . . oh

XD Lol
I like watching AntVenom, "The pro here". Mine a crafting table with a pickaxe
Sky sounds like he has no energy. And You can tell that Ant notices he's quiet and is tryna talk so Sky will hype up. Keep it up Sky. Your doing greatüíô
24:28 for this reason alone i kinda want the seed their using, or a seed with one anyway, as I've never seen this structure before and i wanna see it/one myself first hand! O0O
Would you ever collab with Aphmau again? I loved the videos you did with her in the past.
I miss his excited voice in the good ol days
Nothing like learning how to use a shield
Holy crap I didn't realize how much I missed that intro
Ant: you can't spam hit animals
Sky: oh yeah okay
Sky: Continues to spam click
THAT INTRO 





it makes me remember my childhood
5:52
What we expected: OW STAHP

What we got: woops
Me: Gets done watching antvenom update videos
Youtube recommends: Sky has a new video in Minecraft!
Me: [My icon]
Yooo Adam you should like do crazy craft survival, I think you'd trip a little maybe üòÇ
Those 82 dislikes are the salty 4-7th graders mad that you arnt playing fortnite
With sky back Minecraft revival is finally underway
Sky: I'm a vegan

Top 10 anime plot twists
Ant is so excited and supportive,  my heart is melting
AWWW MAH GAWWHH‚Äô
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a TERTOL!‚Äù
I missed you, Sky.
I love the new sky just as much as the old. You can tell he‚Äôs having fun either way and the new chill sky is refreshing.
I keep watching auto jump activate. SKY! Will you not turn that off?
Here we go again with Adams unorganised inventory ü§£ never change you mad lad you.
He‚Äôs so calm in this, I‚Äôve missed him playing Minecraft
This Is The Most Relaxing Video Of 2019
Yes! I love everything about this!
"did your friends really hold you hostage in room 208 yesterday?"
Awkward pause
"What"
I've been watching a lot of sky'd older videos, and it's very bizarre how calm he sounds in this video compared to the older ones
Sky:*eats beef* I'm a vegan
Man. This reminds me when sky used to be all shy and quiet in his first videos. Hopefully he gets comfortable again and has fun playing ü•∞
This is an hour of random conversations and I love it.
Man it‚Äôs been like 3-4 years since I‚Äôve played it. I recently played it again and I think I developed muscle memory when I played it
Words I never thought Adam would say - "I don't know how to play Minecraft."
Middle of the night. 
Adam puts his sword away, throws a bone and a carrot and starts munchin on the carrots. 
I love this man
I love how he‚Äôs back to being his normal old self and not the one that was very hype just to please kids
Sky you have to join CallmeCarsons SMP Live Minecraft server
Huh, he didnt attack the squids
This seems different
Dude I was like 6-7 when I started watching you and now I‚Äôm 15 turning 16 next month
I feel ya on the whole beef thing. I didn't eat a burger for 3 years and tried one recently. I almost threw up.


You're doing great, keep up the good work! <3
I'm pretty sure hes just high asf in all his new vids thats y he sound so monotoneüòÇüòÇ
Diamonds, nah
Budder, yes!
I started watching you when I was 9 and I‚Äôm now 16 and I love this so much.

Thanks for this my dude.
I love how the first thing he says is: ‚Äú Thurs turtles‚Äù

üòÇ

Don‚Äôt know why I find it funny but I just do
We always support you sky, it‚Äôs great to see you back!
Im shaking and crying i worshipped sky 3 days a week notch would never do this
At the start of the video this sounded like asmr but not too silent.
Been a good minute since i last saw this man!...you plan on joining SMP server?
Almost every 2019 minecraft video:


Youtuber: This is nostalgic


Good days fam xDDD
Youtube: Sky Does Everything Uploaded
Me: insert surprise Shaq meme
Brub MC  hitting us with the comeback, good to see sky playing again,  bajan is back, captainsparklez doing collabs with jerome, battledome happened a few days ago. Glad to see the community come together
Umm...
Hello can I get the wlord seed plz...
This wlord look cool!
i miss sky playing minecraft again!
its been really years since he ever played it again.
Oui this is probably my favorite series of 2019, damn..! Its so interesting to see Sky re-learning everything and learning new! the raw footage is also so- idk! I love it! please continue this series! :D
I cry every vid. 
Time has taken a toll on him skilss
But he is still great mc or not!! 



 also eww squid
I'm so glad he is back, he was my first Youtuber
28:14 You mean Butter dude?
God that hit me
The prophecy always said the king would come back
Yo are you going to play HYTALE, Hypixal‚Äôs new game that comes out later this year
Sky acting like he never played Minecraft
You're doing good my man Sky! Keep it up, don't stop the train going on and on
I‚Äôm really liking the soft-spoken, chilled out voice Adam‚Äôs got going on. Gives this more of a mature, adult feel. 

The long, unedited format is also really relaxing to watch. I hope the series continues like this.
Inner childhood comes out

SKY ARMY
BUDDERSQUAD
sigh The good old days...
Minecraft music starts playing

Ligit this is awesome! I love the collaboration and Sky getting back into Minecraft! This reminds me of the budder agesüòÇüíñ

Pro tip: no sword spaming and play with a keyboard not a controller
You can‚Äôt leave us on a cliffhanger like that Adam
;-; nostalgia
Releases Video
Minecraft Updates
"Dang"
Nestolgic 







Ps:I can't spell
Im so happy that my childhood youtuber is back üòäüòÄ
I'm just coding while this plays in the background. It's nice to hear, though it is interesting to readjust to Adam being so chill this time around. Kinda throws me off a lil, but I'll get used to it, since it's just you being you. :D
Ant: You still have the basics of Minecraft down
Adam: mines at dirt with stone pickaxe as Ant says this



I love you tho Adam. üíõ
2018:meme review

Explodingtnt voice reveal and this?oh boy I'm crying
Oh Boy this reminds me of the old days. AND OH BOY THE INTRO IS BACK. Ya it seems like he needs the recipe book.
Welcome back sky. So happy u keeped you old intro theme
Is this a sign?
28:14 "You Mean Butter Dude" YES
I was anticipating him to start screaming at 5:53 but it was just silence
Its been a while since ive watched Sky. I like this. This is good. Youre doing amazing.
I started watching Adam‚Äôs videos so many years ago when he collaborated with Ant. So awesome to see them together again.
Sky: Oh man! this is so nostalgic! üò≠üòÑ

Literally what everyone is talking about üòÇ
But boy I missed yah adam... so glad fortnite is dying...
YES PLAY WITH CALLMECARSON AND THE BOYS OVER AT SMP LIVE. love!!!!!!!
Join the Minecraft SMP Live server!
"I'm betting I'll find diamonds within the next minute"
Ends the video
Play on 480p for maximum nostalgia
I'm actually enjoying this. Vik just did something similar to this but he didn't even really play the game properly. He ended up spawning in things and going in creative a lot, spawning tnt and blowing things up. This is an actual playthrough which I have been yearning for. Thanks Adam!
This fills my heart nostalgically and I can feel the yelling coming.
Oh man, this is strange
Going back in time, with the shitty(ish) mics
The casual attitude
Just fun
He protecc


He atacc


But most importantly




HE LIEK MINECRAFF
Seeing a survival series with Ant and Sky warms my cold dead heart with the embers of nostalgia.
You two just brought my childhood heart back, love this new series Sky, good luck with your treatment!!
Yay sky is getting Ad Revenue
It was really sweet watching Adam slowly get more comfortable
Keep it up sky
This was great btw 
Be safe
Is it just me or is Sky too funny
Nobody:

Ant: tHE mOsT iN thE eNTirE gAMe
Keep it up, Sky! You‚Äôre doing great!!
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly


He eat special snack
sky sounds so tired and forced. keep it up sky we all love you
Epic boi hours

ü§î INTRO SOUNDS GOOD
Anyone else cringe every-time misused the recipe book

"How do I craft this again 
I know I know
How do I craft this again"
I think I'm gonna cry-
I remember watching Sky play Minecraft 
Coming home from School and watching Minecraft videos 
üò≠ This is nostalgic
Nobody:
Village architect: 26:35
Y'all are back it makes me so happy üòçüò£my childhood is back aghhhhh I've been here for years
I remember watching Sky back when he first started, I was a smol child. And now here I am,  college freshman, still chillin. üòÇüòé
I hope we can rebuild the Sky Army and put minecraft back into the golden (budder) age!
The fact he said butter carrots instead of gold carrots just shows me he's definitely the Sky we all know and love. I love this series
this video is defintly one for the books. Love you sky do what you love we understand and thank you for bringing back my/our childhood love you - skyarmy since day one
And he's back, baby! I grew up watching this dude!
OMG sky your back with the Minecraft awesome
dude you need to turn off auto jump
In about 5 minutes already and hears about them most likely adding foxes NYEH?!?!! FOXES?!?! HURRY IT MOJANG BEFORE I HUNT Y'ALL DOWN! I NEED TO HOG THEM FOR MYSELF!
Adam is either tired or on meds. Either way, im insanely happy to see him backüòÅ
You should Join Callmecarson's SMPLive with Ant.
If we're bringing old Sky back, why not some Renegade and Airwaves background music too
Great too se these guys back in the same vid
Since the combat update, I have not been content with armour. 
And before, I used to not use armour because it gave me more of a thrill. 
Now I get more danger than that thrill even with armour.
Watching this makes want to play Minecraft again
28:15 This man is sad, he doesn't even say budder with excitement like he used toüòîüòî sky i believe you, you can get through this.
This is the rise of the Sky Army
You're getting back to your roots 
We are getting the sky we need
You're gonna beat the actual hell outta depression
We believe in you Adam
the king is back! and i love how chill he is now, haha
When sky didn‚Äôt know how to make a bow, and know there‚Äôs a recipe book. üòäüëç
you should play on callmecarson's SMPlive server
But does Sky know about Hytale?
16:14 hearing Adam‚Äôs tone change to just a little more excited made me smile more than it should have
‚úåüëçüôèü§≤üôåüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Mai heart. Mai soul. MaI nOsTaLgIa!1!1!
Sky milk can cure you from poison quickly.üòÅ
Adam has been re-accepted into the GAMER'S CLUB‚Ñ¢
I love how chill Sky is through most of this
Oh and btw hope bacon man comes back
This is EXACTLY HOW I COMMENTATE
Play with AntVenom, a more laid back person than a group of people who try to hype everything up by screaming lol
This is what im talking about
Adam playing a survival game, with Antvenom to update him on the new stuff.
Such nostalgia, many wow
He's back, for real this time, I love it, Minecraft is back.

10 year old 2013 nostalgia
Bro just click the shield you dont need to actually craft it
Man this is so nostalgic. üòÇüíï
That opening will never not make me smile mah cheldhuuuuuuud!!!!
This isn't a negative comment, but it's like his first ever Minecraft videos back around 2010 or 2011 or even further, except the sound and recording is much better.
I hope you get the energy and hope back to continue, Adam. We're still here; the Sky Army unites.
Ive missed him so much
Butter,wewewewew,try not to laugh, hide and seek, cop and robbers, death run and now completely vanilla
So much has passed and now were back to where we started. Keep it up sky, love you
he got his mic quality back
What's the seed to this world? Because it's beautiful!
This feels like we‚Äôre back in the golden age of Minecraft just plan old survival
I‚Äôm so glad you haven‚Äôt been lost to fortnite
You were my first YouTuber I ever watched and I thought you deleted your Chanel
Ant sounds so different now it‚Äôs weird, but the nostalgia is still hitting me hard.
Dude this video is awesome you two keep up the good work.
God. I miss him just screaming BODIL FORDDDYY
Thanks for the nostalgic tip and thanks for the memories
Oh gosh, the nostalgia. Glad you‚Äôre back, Sky. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve watched these videos, but I still enjoy them. <3
This makes me so sad
So nostolgic üò£
I'm so happy antvenom is still with sky! True friendshipüòå
Who else is happy to hear the old intro?
Watching your intro again brings back memories.
Sky You are gonna be fine keep up the great work
Well, this was nice. Thanks for this.
I like how when ant mentiond the cartigrifer sky clickedon one and walked right bye
I like how when ant mentiond the cartigrifer sky clickedon one and walked right bye
I knew it! Antvenon and sky has the same intro audio. This confirms it!!
The Cartographer gives you the Maps... not the librarian.... libririan only gives you enchanted books xD sky literally talk to the cartographer.. villager wearing white
Something I was taught for diamond mining: turn in coordinates, and go down to the ground level 11-13. Then dig and diamonds are easier to find
You have no idea how much I cried when I saw this video. The nostalgia hit me hard
Hope sky has more energy next episode
"The descent into insanity begins once more..."
Adam let me tell you that you've just brought my amazing childhood back. Thank you!
ADAM. When your good again, are you going to do more parkour maps with like deadlox or Jerome
Walks past blacksmith 

Face plam
üíÄ
I GREW UP WATCHING YOUR MINECRAFT VIDEOS ASWELL AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN TEAM CRAFTED I'M GLAD UR BACK SKY
early bois rise up
Antvenom would teach you how to craft a shield, but not Jschlatt. Lol.
I remember the try not to laugh.... I was only 4 in 2011.... Man sky you have great friends to play with you all I have is my brothers üò≠üò≠
creeper explodes
adam: halp
Welcome back to minecraft skydoeseverything
Adam i love you but pleaseeeee put torches down ;-; my eyes hurt still even though my brightness is all the way up
IM GLAD YOURE BACK BUT I FELL ITA NOT THE SAME AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SORRY FOR WRONG GRAMMAR
Keep it going Sky. We love you and hope to see more!
DID HE SAY...


BUDDER ?
You are one of the most inspirational people and I just want to say, we as your army will support you forever. Get better sky and we have your backüíô
My heart is swelling up "Hey guys sky here" wow it feels nicee
Funny sky, april fools was 17 days ago
this? is so chill god wholesome minecraft boys is back
Ever compared Adam to what he was up till now like he changed a lot but we all know we still love him

Also the FOV is much different from now to back then
This is so nostalgic and nice! I was struggling a lot with English in school and watching sky improved my English massively. That was five years ago, when I was like eleven years old. So thank you Adam, you helped me much more than my extra homework ever did
remember that time you played Pixelmon with munchingbrotato TY and Jason i love those vid
Make your minecraft mentor proud
i love this so much, please make more :,)
actually if you put a torch underneath gravel it will automatically mine them all at once
Oh my god the intro is back yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Want some more nostalgia? Why dont you play Cops and Robbers?
AntVenom: "Carrots by themselves are not great but if we collect gold ingots or gold nuggets we can actually create golden carrots and golden carrots are one of the best pieces of food in the entire game."

Sky: "...You mean budder, dude?"

Oh my god, I never knew I needed you two to make videos again.
the good old times back at last <3
Why can‚Äôt sky eat meat
Bruh 3:35 ‚Äúglass recipe?‚Äù You cook glass. Ugh, noob.
two of my childhood YouTubers in one video! 
my heart is melting ;(
Sounds weird hearing calm sky unlike his old videos where he was getting hyped for the kids watching but I'm ok with anything as long as he is ok.
getting someone like etho in the series would be really interesting since he focuses on extremely complex things with redstone and building with adam who hasn't played regular survival in years and antvenome who is just kinda average would be really fun
hankvenom with the green top house
Do some more parkcore!!!
Right as the creeper exploded at the beginning, a car alarm went off outside where I live
This reminds me of Kawhi Leonards laughter 15:14
Hey sky do some more Crafting Dead plz it was the best and still is
58 Fing minutes of sky and antvenom
used to watch this dude back in 2012
HE IS BACK! THE BUDDA HAS LIVED ON!
REMEMBER THE PARKOUR VIDEOS WITH DEADLOX?? OH MY GOD. CLASSIC
Holding torches in your offhand makes light I think
Ya remember the good old days....now I just watch pewdiepie and memes
Just one thing for me long time fan since 2013, please turn up your sensitivity
Plz play with @Callmecarson
This is good content, keep it up.
The most nostalgic part of sky isn't his voice, personality, etc., it's his skin's hand
adam sounds so out of it and ant is still his mc youtuber self
Are these new videos or reuploads, if they‚Äôre new videos my life is great
Play with ross barny and mad max again i miss them
woah... childhood flashes before my eyes
i like this series, it's like the 2013s for me, just plain and simple minecraft.
ill be waiting for the moment he joins smplive
Woahhhh I'm super late on this but damnn skydoesminecraft is back üò¢
Ahhh it's not the village and pillage update
Hey do you know when Carson is streaming?
what happened didnt sky quit minecraft a few years ago 
also ive been seeing him and a few older minecraft youtubers either becoming relevant again or playing again
This dude said he is vegan bruhhhh i mean kinda nostalgic but turned into a bih lowkey
When I saw that hoard of squids...ah, I absolutely loved that. Too perfect.
I'm so excited it says "EP 1"
7:40-8:00 AntVenom trying to be nice
this is very relaxing ‚ô°
53:10 to 54:15 
H E S  B A C K
HES BACK BOIS
Holy crap baskets
Waiting for a just jump map
Loved the video! Didn‚Äôt realize it was 58 minutes long till the video was over haha
I so want this world. What's the seed?
Don‚Äôt Minecraft under the influence 
If u smoke u know what‚Äôs going on
I like this series. ANOTHER!
Dude i was like 6 or 7 when i subscribed to you
*eats raw meat* 
10 seconds later
dude I‚Äôm kind of conflicted about killing these animals. We should only eat fish.
Antvenom on SMPLive: is mocked for not knowing a single thing
Proceeds to teach someone everything for a whole hour
Adam! Welcome back, fellow brother, we thought we lost you forever.
The legends are true...



The old gods have returned...
No Ant. I am not mad about the gold. I am mad about you leaving The Butter
I'm fixing to cry. This is so awesome to see this dude back at it and bettering himself
You can"t craft glass in a CB you burn sand in a furnace LOL.
28:14 thank me later
28:15 Mah Boi FINALLY SAID IT!
A god minecraft game breaker

Teaching an og who left minecraft and came back
I missed this so much üò≠üò≠üò≠
Sky we love you with much homo bro. Keep up the content watching this is making me feel like a kid again.
Weed changed this man
next update has foxes and new villagers! cant wait until he's caught looking at a ravager
Oof, the wave of nostalgia that just hit me. Glad you guys are having fun playing Minecraft
ant and sky, sky and jerome, sky and deadlox, glad to see they're back, and more importantly skys back!
picaxe on sand. it hurts my eyes
The nostalgia brought tears to my eyes.
Adam, you gotta get in Carson‚Äôs server, that would be quite epic
Early squad





The end game boss should be a huge squid
Plz play with callmecarson live
omg i missed him (the cringe xD)
oof, everything has changed so much since I've last played Minecraft on PC, everytime Adam left items on the crafting bench I expected him to drop items, it's so infuriating that it changed... Anyway, love to see Adam play again!
That intro brought back memories.
my question is will he still need therapy everytime after seeing a squid again like the old times
It really is amazing watching sky play after all this time. I‚Äôve watched him since I was in the fourth grade.
Hey is this series going to continue? I really like this chill playthrough
A god is being reborn
hmm a nice wholesome close up of a Squid Orgy
Screaming into a Mic everyday does a number on the throught so whisper\talk and play Minecraft.
#getskyonsmplive
This should be a live stream
Seeing Adam laugh makes me so happy
I remember like 6 years ago watching your Minecraft videos üò≠
Does this mean Sky is able to join the Carson server because he knows Hankvenom?
Sky‚Äôs voice literally change from high and loud to low and quiet
The sound of Adams voice lifted me up from my bad day.
You should bring Michaelmcchill on maybe next time! He's been working with a lot of the new stuff.
7:56 so this just became New Neebsylvania?
I got myself back in to Minecraft last month, and Adam is playing Minecraft again with his friends after all these years.


nostalgia is hittin hard boi's.
:00000000000000000000000000
Great video. I've learned a couple of things here whilst still being piqued watching you and ant having a reunion.
Stay strong Sky!
It saddens me that adam isnt as hype or as loud as before
Jeez... Sky lost his enthusiasm... where's the balls to the wall Butter yelling Sky we used to know?
You should join Carson‚Äôs smp live server
Love youuu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
*sees video and that its an hour long*
Pls do it more sky it is nice to watch you play minecaft again at age of 19
ohhhh that intro..
Thay was the most depressing sky intro ever I'm sorry
I am happy to see out leader back in action and will dust off my budder armor and proudly wear it again
god bless the flu for letting me stay home today
We can all agree this is all CallMeCarson's doing.
My childhood has returned to me lads, and probably to a bunch of you guys too, thank you Sky/Adam, we love you man.
This video will also teach me because i havent played in a long time
SKYDOESMINECRAFT AYYYYYEEEüî•
Yo what if he brings back Minecraft Universe and they play an Epic Jump map?
yes your back when you left i cried
What, Ant actually doing a let‚Äôs play? I‚Äôm shocked.
Sky update it to Minecraft 1.14 when it releases.
Yes you should teach a 1.13 minecraft
Wooden pickaxe: what is my purpose

Players: you mind three blocks of stone
Top ten best anime reunions
"Help."
I love this. It brings back the old days when I first started watching in 2012-2013.
*hits antvenom with sword
I'm here to help
How patient Antvenom, the Demigod of minecraft is with unknowing, noob Adam is amazing haha.
Holy h*ck I forgot how much I love his voice

My childhood Is back.
like/dislike ratio is legendary damn
Adam it kinda seems like you don't  have energy or so what but I believe in you and do what you truly love
i still remember your long and old intro, still like it to this day
"save me"
Im getting hit by a serious wave of nostalgia.
I question why, ant didn't mention phantoms on the first night
That intro has my heart BEATING! Aaah!
OMG I love antvenom. I miss all of you guys. I hope one day you all will be in a video together like the old daysüòäüòäüòä
This video just brought me so much happiness. It made me think of my childhood. You know, when nothing really mattered...
OH GOD THE MEMORIES THEY‚ÄôRE COMING BACK
Remember adam, DONT DIG STRAIGHT DOWNN!!!!!!
Hearing that intro hit the nostalgia train hard
Hope ur doing well sky, much calmer and quieter than usual
I'm happy Adam is playing mine craft again but I don't want him to push himself to do this but I love just watching vanilla minecraft and watching people having fun
It's been five thousand years.
i was in a hurry so i watched the whole video on 2x speed and i like how clear you guys sound on 2x speed 

p.s i watched all ads
You should us the map that the games give you
Your connecting to your primel roots adam, so familiar. A tender feeling in your heart while you are doing what you use to do in the past. I like that feeling, and i'm sure you like that feeling too. Cuase it brings so many merorys.

I remember when I first discover youtube and I WACTH so many videos, but the one I found was you. Since minecraft was out those days. I remember getting out of school and wacthing you with my sister. 

Ahh, those were the days.
He's missed alot! Especially the updates
the good all days
I love that we're going back to some of the old crew. Deadlox, Jerome, Ant. Who's next? Find out on the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z!
i remember watching skys videos on the mac computer and my brother telling me ‚Äústop watching that he said a bad word‚Äù
You cant sleep need a mob spawner withought torches it wont allow that
And roplay series
Welcome back to another episode of lobby...
I mean, MINECRAFT SURVIVAL!
The old skydoesmc intro is nostalgic
All yall mf that saying he has demotivation or whatever needa chill lmao. This mf just a stoner now let the man chill in peace.
the cartographer is the one with the map
50:04 BUTTER!!!
I'm crying 
Its been years and I'm so happy
lmao this is gonna be *good*.
It's good to see good ol' Sky playing Minecraft again... it feels right...
Sky is so depressed but I'm glad hes doing minecraft again.
28:37 surprisingly a war hasn't started when sky saw those squids
And they said Avengers was the best crossover
Some raw, real, gameplay, YES
Ant Venom is Ye Olde Sage of Minecraft
When and why is sky a Pescetarian?

Maybe he has been like this for years but I‚Äôm only asking since I haven‚Äôt watched sky since 2015
He protec
He attac
but most importantly in this message...




he kem bac
This brings me back to 2012
I'm legit crying to see sky back in minecraft ohhh my childhood just came back
You should play with Ross again
Hey sky  if you see this In the new update  there will be crossbow a enemy Crossing near Village they will be there or not but be careful they have crossbow to
Watching old try not to laugh videos before this üòÇ memories üòî
hold control to sprint
Okay ant venom is in trouble now
o wow...
Skys voice is much softer...
I WANT THE "AAAAAAA" SKYDOES
a lot of people are complaining about his attitude. Guys, if you've been supporting him from the VERY start you would know that this was how he talked back then. Does anyone remember his first survival series? The chicken roommate ? The big ass wooden 'house' he made? Does anybody remember how CHILL he was before and how he sounds like a normal human being?
Instead of complaining why not try to understand him? 
Let him be. 
Youtubers are human. He is also human.
Please bring back Ross I need the best epic duo possible
SKY IS DOING MC AGAIN ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
sky talk to callmecarson and join smp live
29:36, Witch's are powerful but aren't too powerful, the most powerful I'd say is either the Witch or the Endermen, the Creeper would be next.


, Beetroot Soup is indeed a thing.


, You are doing extremely well for someone who hasn't played Minecraft let alone done anything with Minecraft as a whole, so you're still a living legend =)


This video is awesome, thanks Ant, thanks Sky =)
ant keeps referring to it as gold. clearly need to spend more time with our boi here
I'm just going to leave this here.

Stal.
Good hint for zomib sponers. Dran them and if there waring armer they drop it undamaged. And ypu can get a lost of gold and also iron swords. Hehhehe its op as can be. Try it. it is.
sky is so dull sounding       its weird from watching his hilarious upbeat attitude in the do not laugh then listening to this


its kinda sad
I fell so happy when he started playing minecraft again
Sky doesn‚Äôt seem really exciting about playing. Feels like his First video.
Butter!!!

Sky will lead the army to victory! Glory to Sky!

Also nice video, glad you are back.
I remember when I 6 watching you play and now that I‚Äôm 14 I am still subscribed
This video was awesome and gave me a bunch of memories but I was triggered when they didn't get the blacksmith
Dope start to the series, nothing more, nothing less.
Glad your back man
why is the resolution so low it looks all pixelateddddd explainnnn
Sky shift click to make stuff faster instead of dragging things like a furnace
This is awesome, guys can me get 5 likes!!!!!!
I‚Äôm now reliving my childhood. Love.
Yo where notification squad at
he eas stoned in this just trippin playing some minecraft haha
THE GLACIER SEED SUCH A THROWBACK
Cartographer villagers give you maps
Ant and Sky 1.14 is coming on April 23rd, 2019 or Next Tuesday.
I hope team crafted comes back together
Last Watched when i was 11 and now im 17. Feels good man
Do you think you would ever colab with Aphmau (Jess) again?
This is so heart hurting I c a n t
I thought you stopped Minecraft?
He‚Äôs back, my boi is back
Love that he's back, just a little sad he's not the same energy. I mean I know he'll never be the same, but I mean the energy he had when he was filming. But we're here through thick and thin. <3
You should use the new Minecraft textures
he's finally back
I love how calm he seems now more than the hyper sky I grew up with I‚Äôm so glad your back to Minecraft
Legends never die
The perfect birthday gift
godam we got spoiled with the shaders mod pack and music he use to have in the background üò©
It‚Äôs good to see my childhood returning, we all really appreciate you Sky, glad to hear a relaxed voice like the old days, I can‚Äôt tell you how many days you‚Äôve helped me through stuff, keep doing what you are doing Sky, we are always here for you! ^^
Now this, this is the reunion we needed
I hate and love how nostalgic this is.
UP Nostalgia meme kicks in
I remember watching sky every morning before i went to school
YOU FORGOT THE BLACKSMITH
FOV slider plz
Sky bring back Cops n Robbers please!!!!! <3
I can't believe that five years after I was really into Sky's and Antvenom they.. they came back together and are producing good ol content üò´ I'm so happy to see this
You won't tame my kind
I saw this video and I started crying
Fucc yes keep doing this sky
bros chilling playing Minecraft
I like the calm atmosphere.
I needed this video too lmao
Welcome back 
We missed u
Man, sky doin a let‚Äôs play man I‚Äôm getting flash backs and stuff, him just like rediscovering the game with his bud is like awesome and chill at the same time
I love how he gets spooped by all the new mobs, ‚Äúthere, there are turtles‚Äù, sees llama, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is that?!‚Äù, ah, just you wait Adam, just you wait. 

Also
Antvenom: ‚ÄúOne of these trades a treasure map I think, we need to find a librarian I feel like.‚Äù
Adam, look at the Cartographer: well it doesn‚Äôt say librarian guess it‚Äôs not it so I won‚Äôt say anything! 

Ah well, they‚Äôll find it eventually
Has anyone noticed that sky has lost his energy from his older videos
waiting for the day he gets gold and calls it butter
Ah time to relearn the crafting recipes
WE NEED SKY ON THE MINECRAFT SMP WITH CARSON
3 ravines wow üòÆ
Will he still be making music though? Also the king has returned to his butter throne
My 2 child hood heroes, back in a video together plaing mincraft. I couldn't ask for anything better.
I really do hope Sky is doing this because he himself wants to and is not just giving into people asking for him to do this again.






I also do very much enjoy the calm casual coop survival type series. The ones that have episodes around an hour long, no cuts. Just pure gameplay
This is great to see
28:14 ahh, I love how Sky still remembers üòÇ
We‚Äôre back boys üòàü•µü•¥
Sky‚Äôs... I guess more hyper ‚Äúpersona‚Äù would need to build up again, that‚Äôs why he sounds just.... chill I suppose
How high were u making this
Minecraft childhood legend
Oh look it's sky playing with his brother
I love how sky found the cartographer and left
Jesus Christ is the Second Coming of Minecraft
Anyone else screaming when Adam found the map dude
ouf please make thumbnails better, they hurt my eyes.
Sky low key seems like an introvert
28:43
I swear if the creatures decides to revisit Minecraft but without Jordan. That will be a huge nostalgia hype. The og minecrafter that swear or never use over hyper child friendly voice is a good youtuber in my book
Adam thanks for uploading this! Brought back so much nostalgia
Now we need husky truemu and everybody else back
How'd they make a private server?
Why does sky sound so sarcastic and lifeless in the video
Ant venom and Tewty sound the same
Wait is this really sky in 2019?
As nostalgic and funny this is, please make content that you thoroughly enjoy. If you don't enjoy this game like you used to, like you've said before, don't push yourself to play it. :(
Haven't seen that intro in so long. The nostalgia...
Adam do you remember team crafted ( i still love it , and sometimes go back and watch them )
UP NEXT "Ant Venom and sky play COPS AND ROBBERS :D
COPS AND ROBBERS PLS
Yesssss, this is what I‚Äôm talking about, the sincerity of the video and the energy of it, I appreciate what you‚Äôre doing for the fans and most importantly for yourself, hope you get better Adam, be it how it is <3 (marijuana isn‚Äôt a depressant! It is a hallucinogen, not REALLY tho)
THE OG‚ÄôS ARE SLOWLY REUNITING. YESSS!!!!!
Ant is such an amazing teacher!
Ant is such a great guy
the nostalgia is killing me
Do any of you guys remember when sky trolled ant on a custom PvP server
..... One word......

Budder
I just got 16 minutes in Is it me or is he not a energetic and happy as he used to be back in 2013
I couldn't tell at first, but I think Sky has auto-jump on.
forgot the black smith
I cant tell if sky is really depressed or really high üòÇ. I hope its the latter
Most chill minecraft ever ?
Tell jason to come back
Sky what's up. Your voice seems upset.
This is helpful for me too since I‚Äôm thinking of trying out Minecraft again but I haven‚Äôt played in a long time
its been so long since i have seen your minecraft videos the nostalgia is real
This video makes me really happy!
The into got my feelings
I love you
While you are on the nostalgic topic, you should bring back pok√®craft(edit pixelmon)
Sky once u get your mojo back can u do crazycraft with fluffy
It makes sad that Adam isn‚Äôt as energetic as he used to be playing Minecraft üò≠
I'm ligit crying, this , this makes me so fucking happy, watching him get to know the game that helped build him up, and I get the honor to actually watch it happen first hand this is just amazing to me.
Dam. I remember always watching sky's videos before life went to basically complete crap.
They sound so enthusiastic.








xD haLp
You should play 1.14 now
53:20 "boo"
Sky+Ant videoes are always adorable
adam, you didn't loot the blacksmith building in the village
It's pure irony that one of the most famous Youtubers to have their channels built on the foundation of Minecraft doesn't know how to play modern 1.13/1.14 Minecraft.
Adam laughing makes me so happie
Also 50:15 butter on your right
In glad he's back I didn't want to grow up without him
that intro
sky, here is a tip, once you have iron, go down to y level 13, to check press f3, once you are there just dig around because that is the level that is best to search for diamonds
People leaving Minecraft for 1.9  Java update. Why leave Minecraft and not play Bedrock instead?
We need da ROOoOsSS
What about Captain Sparkles

Oh wait he‚Äôs busy
The intro hit me
when will sky play minecraft with callmecarson
I had one of the biggest smile while watching this
the return of the king
jschlatt has entered the lobby
He sounds board
42:12 hmmmm
Is sky ok.?? I haven‚Äôt watched in a while and he seems different
Ah the Master Anthony Venomous is lending his aide
I live for this. 
Also, go inside the blacksmith in the village to get the goodies.
45:00 ant lemon the genius
5:59 save me ant (sounds like save me aunt)
Who else gets chest pains when they see someone break a crafting table with a pick axe?
i miss him playing minecraft
Pls respond
Sky should join SMP live

Is that hankvenom
I miss do not laugh with people like max, ross, and red! Will we ever get that back Adam or is that gone forever?
NANI!?
20:14 Omg that chuckle...
After learning that he's been struggling with depression for a long time, hearing a genuine chuckle from him is so heartwarming, ESPECIALLY when he's not putting on a fake voice throughout the video!
The King has Returned!
This is a great series
We need episode 2
He's preparing Adam for the smplive server
God I missed this
SKY IS SUBBED TO TSERIES
4 years ago sky quit minecraft, now the minecraft god is back
42min in I think we‚Äôre 23 mins in xD
Please join the minecraft smp
He sounds so tired of the past and is just taking his time going back to what made him happy and it‚Äôs almost like he lost it. 
It‚Äôs kind of, weirdly beautiful? He just sounds so pure and clueless playing this.
0 dislikes My Life is Fulfilled
Revive of Minecraft? ü§îü§î
you roasted ksi
It sounded like Antvenom scripted the wholr episode
Finally, after so long, sky does minecraft
After we're all satisfied with our intense nostalgia trips, and Sky wants to switch it up again, wouldn't it be dope to see him experience 2b2t?
Antvenom only making it Not boring since he's like, the only one who's just chitchatting everything
HE ATTACK BUT MOST IMPOTENTLY HE _BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D
You should play on CallMeCarson‚Äôs server

I needed this
i haven't watched your videos since you came back after "quitting" i remember coming home from school watching your videos everyday from way back when you played with dawn through you quitting skydoesminecraft with a few breaks in between. I turn 18 this year and i think this series might bring me back to watching you again. Im glad to see you're doing good these days and i look forward to your future vids!
Better crossover than infinity war
'Aight he's back.
AHHH THE DYNAMIC DUO
play on 2b2t.org >:)
Creepa.... AW MAAN
Ship guys?? Yes??
I miss you and antvenom playing Minecraft
Why is sky so quiet
A dive into my childhood :,D
Sky: "can I tame turtles"

Antvenom: "You can tame foxes soon"
I'm gonna finish this series no matter what happens
The gods have spoken....

Let the ship SKYVENOM SAIL AGAIN!
It‚Äôs so weird to watch his older videos and have him basically know everything but now Adam forgot the core functions. Not complaining, it‚Äôs just weird to me.
When will sky play with call me Carson
Wait a minute... I‚Äôm so confused.... I DIDNT KNOW HE CAME BACK WHAT THE HECK OMG MY CHILDHOOD
I recently was rewatching all the skydoesminecraft videos hoping more will come üò≠
47:34 - Iamond would be a cool alternative name for steel since it's made of iron and carbon üòÖ
Nostalgia hits back!
UP PIANO MUSIC STARTS
I can't even find a village after days of looking and these 2 come back from the depths of dead youtubers and get a village first day üòë
Who like minecraft
I missed the butter intro
Just leaving this for myself 47:35
Omfg he‚Äôs back!!
He sounds tired XD
I really hope he comes back to his past self... a blast from the past
How about Antvenom teaches you how to play bedwars on Hypixel :)
Is anyone else annyod over them n
Sky and Ant:Don‚Äôt mind us we‚Äôre just gonna take these crops!

Villagers:-_-
He even looks like your mentor with the amulet
Nostalgia overload.
Yesss another vid

20k likes for a wither fight
So uh why isnt he screaming anymore?
Adam needs to go on CallmeCarson‚Äôs Minecraft Server
Ladies and gentlemen. We got em.
sky you better get on carsons server
YOU DIDNT CHECK THE BLACKSMITH CHEST
Why does Sky sound so emotionally dead
But I feel like the audio is messed up or not how it should feel like sky‚Äôs voice
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ sky your amazing
SkyDoesNostalgia
Every time I watch Sky I get like Vietnam flashbacks + Nastalgia
How many times did Venom day ‚Äògood to go‚Äô?
I would rename this nostalgia the movie
SMPlive or riot

Play on callmecarson‚Äôs server while streaming!!!
‚ÄúSave me‚Äù

I got really emotional watching this for some reason
I got really emotional watching this for some reason
Oh, you're back
oh i love it... the asmr of it all
If you're looking for a good challenge, try 2b2t.org! It's minecraft's 2nd oldest server, and has NO RULES.

The people there would pose a true challenge for your recently returning Sky Army as well. Ask AntVenom about the server, he knows it very well.

Alternatively, FitMC has access to libraries worth of knowledge regarding this most unique of places in the Minecraft mythos.
Should‚Äôve joined callmecarson‚Äôs server lol
sky let play terraria
That blacksmith...the one most important thing in a village...missed... still watching the video so don't come for me
I haven't seen sky does everything in two year now
49:44
Two bros, chilling in their own beds, 5 feet apart cause they‚Äôre not gay. üòÇ
omg this is awesome
That one creeper right at the end of the video
Adam seems so chill in the beginning
Hank?
Dawg I spilt my hot choclate on my shorts.








It was good. Just like dis vid
Sky on the  smp live server?
BuT wHeRe'S sTaL?
My childhood has returned
This makes me really happy.
Yu just got home from school too? 





I‚Äôm going to sleep what if I wake up with 2500 subsüíïüíï
Am i high, or does Antvenom sounds like a male elastigirl
all he needs now is yer boi jordonian
Anyone else confused in there voices
Antvenom: I bet I'll find diamonds in the next minute
video ends
But seriously tho, I thought I was back in 5th grade in 2014 watching old minecraft videos, I was so into this
My inner childhood is screaming
How long has it been
I love butter
Oh god I haven‚Äôt watched a Minecraft Video from you in a long time
Adam/Sky (whichever you'd prefer-) I really hope you enjoyed being able to play Minecraft along with Antvenom again, I'm not sure what you went through in your life outside of youtube, but I really, truly and sincerely hope you're doing better! Its good to see you playing again, but please know that if you dont feel comfortable uploading Minecraft anymore, (Im not trying to demand that you stop uploading Minecraft or something if you do enjoy it, by all means do as you wish, I will personally watch any video you upload) I urge you not to push any limits you dont think you can pass, especially with pressure coming from subscribers. We're here to watch your videos and be entertained but also to help in any way we can! to see you posting Minecraft again is indeed nostalgic to all of your viewers!

Anyways, I hope you get the chance to read this, and if not thats cool too! I hope you have a lovely day & or night :)
And Barny
49:40
Sky needs to join smp
sky does everything.... do u do die?
the NOSTALGIA
This'll probably get buried, but thank you so much for doing this again Sky. I am just tearing up with nostalgic memories. I used to watch you eight or so years ago doing these survival episodes and just seeing this again, not gonna lie, it was impossible for me to shed a few tears :)). Thanks for doing this again, I think it's safe to say that you've made thousands of kids have a really awesome childhood. You're a blessing.
THE NOSTALGIA AHHHH
Vegancraft
On console you don't have to wait for a cool down for a weapon
hello, mr hankvenom
He sound so sad üòû
101 #1
YASSSSS
I found a zombie spawner right next to one of my spawns and I turned it into my base
Adammmm you sound so depressed bud
everyone liked that
What a throw back to when I was 11 :,)
sky sounds so sarcastic and uninterested its funny
You sound so different from your old videos.
Play with CallMeCarson
Minecraft 101 Episode 2: SkydoesRedstone. Featuring Mumbo Jumbo and Iskall and the window person at your local chinese resturant.
I can already tell I‚Äôm gonna be obsessed with this series
Haha lol
its weird to see sky play this game again
I have killed five in one day
lovely wholesome minecraft lets play, even better than the old days because it is a teacher and a student, rather than them all not knowing what to do lol
you should branch out from minecraft, i like your personality its a shame you only play this game really.
I‚Äôm an OG fan I‚Äôve been a fan since 100k and it‚Äôs so amazing to see how far you‚Äôd come. I can‚Äôt lie creating a new survival server and punching trees is so nostalgic. I remember when I was following you and antivenoms server and I beat the ender dragon for my first time legit in 2012. You were such an inspiration. I hope you get help with your depression.
This made me cry
Daddy is back!!!
Man, to think that the moment I actually care about Sky's content is when he is relearning Minecraft. I never really was an avid watcher of his Minecraft content back in the day, since I wasnt really for the type of stuff that he did. However, now I actually feel like I'm in the same spot that he is, entering a world that I havent dived into fully for a long time, and re-learning the ropes along with him. I think that everybody who has played Minecraft at some point in their lives and them stopped for a while might be able to really enjoy this series.
Memories dude memories
Decent Comment 

Those people: "uNdERaDeted cOmMEnt"
I didn't check how long this went for and thought "oh just 10 minutes of Sky yay" but then I checked the time like 3 minutes later and I was like "HOLY CRAP!!!  ALMOST AN HOUR WITH SKY?  HELL YEAH"
OMG AM I BLIND? FINALLY!1!1!1!!1
god adam is so gloomy in his tone and ant is super motivated but most of all its quiet just like old skydoesminecraft ahhh the nostalgia
hes so depressed XD
Ant there sounds like he is still doing one of his videos
Budder armor a quids
Yeah yeet! Sky learns how to minecraft. Only started watching but a few tips to minecraft survival. I don‚Äôt know how much you remember of minecraft because there‚Äôs been quite a lot of updates in the past year. 
Don‚Äôt stay in the water for to long, there‚Äôs underwater monster.
Don‚Äôt go into a woodland mansion without good gear, blocks and good weapons.
Don‚Äôt waste iron or diamonds on a hoe.
Staircase and strip mine when mining.
Be careful. 
Don‚Äôt mine straight down.
If traveling to different realm put important stuff in a chest.
Try not to stay out at night.
For a starter house don‚Äôt build big.
Comment other tips, I‚Äôm not to great at survival myself.
Ah yes, HankVenom and SoyDoesHeroin
22:00 r/whoosh ;_;
HANK
Adam seems really out of it during this video.. Is it just me?
SKY GO TO 1.14.1
This is great!
This is just nostalgic and calming and entertaining. It's just classic Minecraft, two friends talking about random things without being overly energetic to appeal to an audience. I needed this.
You were so chill weird
THE OLD DAYYYYYSS
So many memories
I love sky‚Äôs videos but don‚Äôt you think that he should be a little more excited
Is crazy craft a posability to come back?
Real fans remember turtle Adam
Sky try 2b2t

You missed the black smith house
Will never understand these dislikers...
Its so cool that he‚Äôs back. My childhood is flooding back tome, but I wish he didn‚Äôt sound so sad all the time and he had a bit more excitement
Adem I think you should collab with Ross(aka yourpalross) to have a good laugh
This is the most ambitious cross over event in history
Join 2b2t
You should add ssundee into this series
Like if you agree
I'm out of the loop, why did Adam go back to Minecraft? I thought he didn't like it anymore
oh look at that. that is so cool :|
Blacksmith building?? Usually has good stuff
Fix your settings
29:54
My childhoodüò≠
Is this real
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
hey sky, it‚Äôs been 5 years since i watched a vid from you (last one was modded cops n robbers) and i‚Äôm so happy to start watching your vids again
Ant venom still plays Minecraft for fun? I thought he just does reviews I remember when antvenom did Minecraft skits like fnaf and so on
So is he gonna be a content creator again or is he gonna ditch us again
The world breaks because of antvenom
27:13-Sky actually found the treasure map trader, the cartographer, I am sure they trade you these maps as well in java. Such as the wood land mansion and the ocean monument
He went though phases
I wanna know what's the specs of Adam's pc
Minecraft is about to rebirth yey
a legand is reborn
Omg my childhood is back !
SQUID 28:23

Ayyy pescatarian gang! Mine is more for health reasons tho, I also really dislike pork and not a big fan of beef.
He sounds so disinterested
He is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YOOO

Did I just time travel back to 2013??? Oh my god the nostalgia
Why did people stop watching sky
Lol y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt loot the forge in the village
YES
why do you sound like that
Hoo boy, y'all are kickin it up in Minecraft again around the same time the Yogscast start their Diversity 3 series. We truly are entering a Renaissance for the game, let's hope it lives long and well.

Please do cops and robbers
Oh my childhood memories, this is so heartwarming to watch
world seed?
I feel like I went back 6 years
why are you subbed to t series?
Be careful! They‚Äôre heroes.
the boys are back
He‚Äôs slowly coming back to us, throughout the episode he slowly got more and more loud and energetic, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs fully restarting, learning the game and learning YouTube again
sky isnt old hes aged like a fine cheese
Nostalgia
he sounds so sad and unmotivated..but it makes me so happy seeing him play this again, or at least giving it a shot. i‚Äôve been watching him since i was 5-6 and i‚Äôm 14 now
he-he's bACK?????
You say you're good but you don't remember you can burn wood to make charcoal  just a tip
Time for 1.14
This isn't the same. You just sound so unenthusiastic.
I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs playing minecraft again and I only just FOUND OUT?????
Hey guys, welcome to year of nostalgia And Minecraft
Adam u ok??
 
U know u don‚Äôt have to play this if u don‚Äôt want to
stall
50 years have passed... but I do not age. Time has lost its effect on me. Youtube‚Äôs chokes the past, present and future. Hope is lost... 
Gotta get back. Back to the craft...

SkyDoesMinecraft!








I like this SkyDoesMinecraft Season 5

I love you skyyyyyy!!!!
Yo I can't, I love this oml. Throwback to when I was an angsty 12 year old, when sky was all that got me through each day. Now I'm off to uni in a couple months and I have so much love for you, no matter what, cause you got me here x
Is this real?
All thats left is to get the old gang back together like bajancanadian,deadlox,huskymudkips,captainsparklez and more
Sky sounds so sad
Not gonna lie i kind of like this calm sky. It feels like meeting an old friend and seeing how he's grown.
Lol llamas with hats xD
Carllllllllllllll
its not the same
Sky play 2b2t
sky does minecraft is back!
alas! The Pewdiepie of Minecraft has returned.
nice you missed the blacksmith in the village.
I'm happy he's making videos again, but am I the only one that notices he's different. He sounds like he's uninterested
wha- i- wha- i cant belie- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Sky is a bit less energetic than he was before
sky army
The good old days ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëå
You can make turtle helmet don't think that's the name but go with it and you can get it from A   baby turtle
Please reupload Sky vs gaming. Please. I beg you to consider this for the fans like me. Who‚Äôve been here since team crafted and THROUGH sky media. I was here from the beginning to the end to the rebirth. And I miss Sky Vs Gaming. I miss butts69 and gta and gmod. Please?

Wow now this is nostalgia

WITH A DRAGON ON TOP WITH LAZER GUNS ON THE SIDES!!!! i also look like a walmart brand iron man bro i can fly and ride my pet lazer t rex and make friends online this game has it aaaaaaaaallllll my mind is blown
I started watching you when I was like 11/12 idk, but now im gonna turn 18 this year. I've seen everything. I am so happy that you're back and doing and getting better. It's so relieving and calming.
Enter childhood nostalgia
Sky seems like he's become more mellow....
Butter, Nothing more.
A husk of a man...
It smells like my childhood in here.
you guys just ignored the blacksmith so i'm annoyed it also annoys me how you are always aimed slightly down and you aren't jumping as you sprint to go faster and your parkour skills are just barely there i think you need to hop on epic jump map to get back into the movement groove
I watched the whole thing. How bout‚Äô you?
who else is so happy he back?
Adam didn‚Äôt get the budder
The god of Minecraft has returned, I‚Äôm all ears now, locked and loaded for nostalgia
ahhhhhhh skynite backnite playnite feetnite
What he playing this again
Hey guys hankvenom here
Hey guys hankvenom here
I love it
2019 Is a comeback of many Minecraft YouTubers specially this month(April)
What happened... all those years ago...
Sky‚Äôs little ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs turtles‚Äô was so adorable.
Yea
Sky sounds so dead inside
yes
He has alot to learn.
I ‚ù§Ô∏è u sky!
Sky has been through so much these last few years. And I haven't seen his videos since the 10th try not to laugh. Or even the whole team crafted stuff. I veered off to watch other people's videos and sometime occasionally I come back. I'm 16 yo and I remember sky's old survival series from machinima  and got upset when he only got to the point of getting an eye of ender and find the dungeon. I was around 9 or 10 idr. But seeing sky now makes me think about how old I've gotten and how not only my mind but my sense of humor. And also how much sky has changed. I hope he loves this series as much as i do because i stopped playing after 2015 and just recently got back into it
Am I in heaven?
Im so happy he is getting help and going back to his real friends. During the phase of the office I feel like there was a lot of fake people is his life
AntVenom Teaches Sky About Minecraft Again 2: AntVenom Teaches Sky About The Far Lands
Could you do, modded survival?
If you do here's a suggestion: crazy craft
It‚Äôs like, so painful watching him not know certain things lmao, I mean like I get it though ‚ù£Ô∏è
sky's laugh sounds like seth rogans.
Ski you sound so sad you good lately dog?
there was a blacksmith in the village aaAAAA
am i having deja vu or what
Reminds me of the olden days of SkyDoesMinecraft, DanTDM, and Atlantic Craft
what year is it?
Don't you like how the water is more transparent with the night vision + don't get attacked by phantoms....Calab with jess to have a pet or doge series
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Sky sounds weird.
Gold nuggets= shard of budder
I‚Äôm sad why does sky sound so unmotivated
Y'know that voice you do when your trying to explain something to someone younger than you who doesn't know how to do that task?
...
That's Ant in this entire video.
Sky i xan help you get beater i have played minecraft for 5 years and i want to play with the person that helped me get through some roof times and i am all was here to help
I'm so mad neither Adam or ant noticed the blacksmith reee
ye boi, a series
Why when i see this video, the Yogscast parody How Do I Craft This Again? pops in my mind
I've never watched a video in the same exact position I have with Sky's minecraft videos. I watched this and instinctively went into that position. Is something wrong with me?
I‚Äôm kinda worried that he doesn‚Äôt wanna play Minecraft anymore and that he‚Äôs playing cause he needs money or something
my childhood....
Yo Sky, I‚Äôm kinda stoked for this series. I hope you can upload more frequently with this series or even livestream it. You seem like you are just without reading the comments so yeah. This is really cool to see you and Ant playing again.
Give him time guys, he's coming back but he did say he's still got loads of depression he wants to dig himself out of, and believes facing his past again will help him be happier...that and he's working himself off of weed so probably some withdrawal symptoms too
I'm really happy that Adam is back with the minecraft videos. It's very pleasant and brings back a lot of nostalgia.
Lol, from Sky's POV he seems like a noob
Sky and AntVenom still have the same purple necklace on their skins. Has anyone else noticed?
ADAM I have to warn you from something that spawns in night timw they are called phantoms the spawn when ever a player doesnt sleep for 3 minecraft days its some what like a insomnia mob killer it will force you to get a bed or go to sleep
There was a blacksmith at that village
Omg omg omg hhhhhuuuuu hhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhh uuuuuhhh he's back my child hood row modle is back aaaaaaaahhhhhh!
Good to have you back, Sky!
totally misses the blacksmith
HESS BACKKK!!!
4:40 FACEPALM
Sky plays nostalgia.
he doesnt sound as happy as he used to be
When u run out of money...
awesome video
Note do not ask sky/Adam to do Minecraft vids again hes doing it by choice
I Used to watch him since 2013 and i was just 7 years old, and now im 13 years old in high school, going grade nine next year.
i no longer want to commit die
Real Minecraft hours
Play with ross
Is Sky ok? 
He sounds sad or tired
Minecraft is starting to become popular again and i hope it becomes better than fortnite
Why does sky sound so depressed.
Why did you leave us whyy you sound depressing no offense
He didn‚Äôt yell ‚ÄúSQUIDS‚Äù when he saw the squids.
Are you still friends with red, Jess, awkward,husky,Ross,BURNEY,mad max, or is that in he past
I feel like Antvenom is a father figure to him, teaching him all the new things of the world, making sure he doesn‚Äôt get hurt too much. It‚Äôs adorable.
Sky=childhood
Ok so im halfway through, why dont they go to the blacksmith house on the village
antvenom so uptight lol, so technical. 
i feel like sky's just want to have some goofy conversations
Did you know that swords do damage to multiple enemies when you full swing.
(see that little sword icon next to cross hair for charge)
I'd love a crossover with FWOB (Friends Without Benefits) because they're currently doing ironic Minecraft videos, playing it split-screen on the Switch to top it all off
I jumped when I saw that creeper explode because I forgot about shield mechanics xD
Ant saying "I'm, like, not expressing it because that's how I am these days" is painfully too self-aware D:
minecraft vsauce and sky! üòç
YOUR BACK OMG BEEN SUBED SINCE 2012
Ey sky try goin on the 11th hieght block to get more ores and diamonds
I mean as in the Y is 11
This is somehow enjoyable to watch. Very Nostalgic.
Omg that intro was so nostalgic wowwww
ya mean butter dude? 


legit crying
I am so happy Minecraft is getting relevant again! I love seeing old Minecraft YouTubers getting more views and I just think Minecraft was a beautiful game
Good to see u sky,I personally missed u,a lot...
WHEN YOU PLAY MINEEE MINEEEE MINECRAFT
For some reason every time I hear or see antvenom in YouTube it reminds me of callmecarson
This takes me back to the first skydoesminecraft I saw with Antvenom  in it. It was Minecraft battleship. Oh how time flies
Sky I miss you.
Sky sounds like he‚Äôs baked.Or is it just me?
Did they see the smithy building?
I grabbed my butter, my butter sword, my butter popcorn, my dead squid carcass, my sunglasses and I'm 'bout to start blasting How Do I Craft This again while playing modded cops & robbers

As a kid I always wanted to play minecraft with sky, now i want to smoke a blunt with sky
OMG
All them drugs done destroyed his minecraft part of his brain.
These copyright strikes get STUPIDER EACH TIME I SEE THEM
They just walked past a blacksmith house in the village...
All we need now is aphmau and the others playing mini games and sky screaming!
That sounds like a broken man. You okay, Adam?
HE SOUNDS SO DIFFERENT JESUS CHRIST!
Me in my head when they got to the village: BLACKSMITH BLACKSMITH BLACKSMITH BLACKSMITH BLACKSMITH
Man I miss the old days of do it laugh and cops and robbers

Who like minecraft
Is sky depressed or is that just his normal voice because I swear he used to sound more cherry
want to see u play fornite
It feels good to have sky back
Pls do some cops and robbers
i think he has auto jump on
Poor Sky sounded like he didn't he didn't wanna be there
But with how easy it is to get fish now being a pescatarian in Minecraft really wouldn't be that bad
play with ssunde
Can you do try not to laugh agen with Ross
üò≠üò≠I feel like I‚Äôm nine again sitting in front of my iPod touch right after school, with a bag of popcorn watching Minecraft modsüò≠üò≠
Stall is the worst
Remember watching his cops n robbers vids then your parents walk in so you turn the volume down so they won‚Äôt hear him swearing. 
Lol good old days

the crappy mic quality like in 2013 just gives me a nostalgia high ü§§üòç
Aww man my childhood memories are coming true. :')
I still remember seeing you when I was 7 now I‚Äôm fourteen. Ahhh the nostalgia!
Sky just sounds so confused I just imagine him in his mind saying What happened to this game HOW LONG WAS I GONE HOW DO I CRAFT?!? Ah I love it
The memories
Their flooding my mind
NEXT TIME ON SKY 
TEAM CRAFTED IS BACK
Jerome: but just to show you one of the cool custom plugins right you break the sto-
obsidian
Adam laughs
Cut
OH MY GOD SKY!
the floodgates have opened i repeat THE FLOOD GATES.HAVE.OPENED ;-;-;-;
I watched you when I was around 8. I am now almost 15. Seeing the title gave me the chills because I used to look forward to coming home from school just to watch you play Minecraft on my family computer. Thank you <3
ü•∫ Jerome calling Adam buddy is adorable and I‚Äôm the softest I‚Äôve been in a while ü•∫
Dude I'm glad you're back Minecraft hasn't been the same without you keep up the great vids man
We... need... a... do.. not.. LAUGH AND APH NEEDS TO DO MIDNIGHT 4!!
I love how Jerome is so upbeat and presenting he just makes the videos feel like back in 2013 or something
The old intro is back!
2018: MEME REVIEW

Guess who's back back again

Thank you, we needed this, we waited 4 years. We greatly appreciate this
Question

Who else misses those Christmas maps with a mystery twist with it.i loved those oh and please sky...#bringbackparkour!!!
Can't believe you're collabing with Fluffy again!!

Turns to obsidian instantly
Me:Yep, Sounds about right

This makes me smile, I almost feel like crying tears of joy because of this
Adam seems to have a much more chilled-out demeanor... you know what? im diggin' it. its not as manic as it was, which is different, but its not bad. he's still the lovely lad i knew before. :) ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Nostalgia flood gates open

what a great way to start spring break by binge watching all of sky's videos!
only true fans knows this






what's a butter slapper????
Who remembers the good days of cops and robbers, those were the best days. Minecraft was still active and life was great. Who agrees those were the days?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you realize how excited I am‚Äù he says in the most monotone voice
Oh shet. That intro. ITS BEEN SO LONG!!
When I was a young boy about 10 or 13 years of age I use look forward to your videos now here I am a young man watching at age 18 thank you, for building my childhood and now rebuilding my happiness and wonder 

- Koken R Redlord
The Archon...








Sounds Familiar to me...

That intro..........holy hell, Got more goosebumps then I did watching the Force Awakens trailer for the first time.
This takes me back. Thank you for this.
Man I love these videos...especially with the OGs (team crafted) keep up the good work sky
Bruh brings me back to when all I played was mc keep doing this stuff man! So nostalgic
hearing on how Adam talked before compared to the way Adam talks today is unbelievable!


I don't know if it's just me but, he sounds a whole lot more mature and modest than before.
his voice gives off a much calmer tone.


I've been watching Adam ever since he did Mod Showcases back in 2012.
being able to see him still up and kicking today is great to see.
2:55 ROBLOX!!!!!!!

Quick tip Adam click the green book beside the 9 boxes that you use to craft stuff so that you can craft stuff faster
Adam you should try and get a big ole reunion with all the people you played with and play one big battle dome
I feel like my soul has been lifted watching this
You subbed to T-Series!?!
The fences not connecting was really triggering me
The explosion in the intro? It's a nostalgia bomb
hey sky. you should do a video series for a really popular game called skate 3.
Adam, love u b but ya gotta stop w this notch praise in ya description
Welcome back, old friend, welcome back. 

This is unironically an emotional rollercoaster for me, because you were one of the first you tubers I watched as a kid.

Welcome home.
The flashbacks are coming back and I swear to god all I feel is happiness
Who's 'No one' and why are they 1st 2nd and 3rd in top 3 Controllers!?! 

HMMMMMMMM
I love you 
Never stop
Unless it bores you
Jerome‚Äôs audio quality made me think this was a reupload

DERP SSUNDEE
OMG
Also it's really quiet
10 seconds in and I'm already feelin it
Second post:
PLEASE LISTEN. you probably have a 0% to read this, but I want you to hear me out. Minecraft has a new combat system, there is now a penalty for clicking too fast. let me explain. do you notice that tiny sword icon below the cross at the center of the screen? well whenever you attack, it quickly appears on the screen and fills up, the more it fills up, the more damage you will do. if it fills up all the way, then you do a powerful sweep attack that can hit multiple enemies. this is why you shouldn't spam click, because the bar doesn't have enough time to fill up even a little bit, so you do astronomically less damage overall. I know you won't read this, but I sincerely hope you will learn it at some point... thank you
‚ÄúYa boi outta cactus‚Äù
Same here but I‚Äôm out of brain cells.
Also, I act the same way lmao. I have no idea whats happening but I just go with the flow. Except for when I know about the subject.
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS!!!! it's so cool to see you and Jerome doing stuff like this again. super nostalgic. thank you for everything Sky!!
THE INTRO IS MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD, I‚ÄôM LITERALLY CRYING RIGHT NOW.
it brings tears to my eye when you see the sole members of the original group working together :')
Jerome is a great friend
Use ur old intro where you sang in it I love it da da da da daaaaa XD
I just jumped back to 2012.
Wait you upload still? Holy nostalgia butter

I remember watching sky back when i was 37, now I‚Äôm 24 going on strong
Dude Jerome playing Archon??? Ive been watching him since 2012
Dude you know what would be fun if you made a war focused tech focused modpack and war with friends.
It's nice to see you back and playing minecraft I missed you man
Dude I‚Äôm so happy 




Breathe if you agree
It‚Äôs awesome to see that he‚Äôs making Minecraft videos again :)
Already started rewatching all of sky's vids
I really hope this is what Sky wants. I'm always gonna be a supporter brosif. I know I wasn't around for a while and you got no clue who I am but you enriched my childhood.
just asking again, in a more recent vid, can you play dead by daylight
Kinda sad he never called him fluffyüòî
im sixteen and i now started watching ur vids again for the first time since 2014 i started watching in 2012
I miss my life 4 years ago... Loving it more than ever...
I think I might enjoy MORE of this.
Jerome I could imagine being a salesman or a workplace ethics speaker- he has the perfect voice and charisma for it honestly. Odd thought I know- but this video has him speak for himself. XD
Jerome: "So what this does is-"
Me: "I WILL BUY YOUR ENTIRE STOCK!!!"
I honestly thought that this was an old video, so I check the date and it‚Äôs from today. :0!
Mind Blown
10 k in 40 min 
I remember when it was like 1 mil in 40 min those were the days
Broo!!! You sound so Awkward!! No hate, btw
No one: 

0s / 2m
2019 the year of collaboration and content we didn't know we needed in our lives. I'm in tears
Wait a minute...

Sooo much nostalgia. But sky seems so unfamiliar to Minecraft xddd.
Bruh I just came back after awhile and damn it feels good to be back. One of my greatest youtubers who helped me through so much. Literally with a single Minecraft video whether do not laugh or mini games, wow it feels so good to be back. I hope you‚Äôre doing better Adam, love you so much üíú
is this just reuploads or is he actually playing again?
True OG's remember Cops and Robbers
I have aged so much and once I saw this upload I had to watch just wowwwüò≠
That intro is older than one nutty boi
I was 7 when I saw you hmmmf the nostalgia is just soo fcking good
Heh the Jerome slurp
Jerome is such a good friend
Sadly I play on the green dye server and have a lot of things that I don‚Äôt want to lose on there. I would switch if I didn‚Äôt buy blaze rank
NOT Jerome teach me how to sky block it‚Äôs HOW 2 SKY BLOCK (NO HELP XDD)
I feel like sky was zooted during this
My god the nostalgia, the flashbacks have returned me to my childhood
Did we just time travelled to the past? Omg.
I feel like time is rewinding. My depression is coming back but also my favorite Minecraft youtubers!! I have mixed feelings but mostly positive feelings!
My childhood Nostalgia...‚ù§

YOOOO they should do sky factory
Does it work on pocket edition?.
Ah many things have changed. But one thing that will never change is








Jeromes mic quailty. It sounds like he has the same mic as he did 8 years ago.
Haven't seen stuff like this when I was 7, brings tears to my face
I miss the old team crafted but I still love these vids
Sky bring back the orange-ish brown thumbnails.
Every fell through for him and now he‚Äôs back
This video brings nostalgia just how it was edited.
B U T T E R

Hey sky it‚Äôs ya boi a fan and I was rewatching your pirates roleplay and you kinda left us on a cliffhanger I‚Äôve been waiting forever for season 2 so when are you gonna start roleplaying again

OMG the nostalgia with Jerome being so energize and pumped
OMG THE OLD INTRO SOUNDS SOOOOOO GOOD
Adam you sound so much better glad to see your feeling better (to anyone who wasn‚Äôt caught up he had depression so he had to take a break to deal with his depression)
sky discovers t h e s k y
Everyone who watched sky like 5 years ago (including me) have returned and the comments are really wholesome
Im really glad skydoesmi efraft is back, but i hope that you get well soon sky, we love you
Nastaglic anyone?
ITS BEEN 5 YEARS FOR ME, THIS TAKES ME BACK
I‚Äôm not crying üò≠ you are!
Brings a tear to my eye, Adam. It really does.
Diversity 3 came out. It's the end to the trilogy of Diversity Maps. I'm sure you remember Diversity 2
I can't even explain how hAPPY I got when they were yelling like it was 2013 all over again my head is hunG
It‚Äôs perfection üòÇ
You should join CallMeCarson's SMP server
I got super confused and i was wondering if this was an old video but i didnt remember it. Now i know youre back yay
IT'S PERFECTION!
Bring my man Ross back
The Return of the King.
i, for one
get the joke.
Jerome sounds so corporate now. He just sounds like he wants to sell us ranks for the server.
the introvert vs the extrovert
Why does it look like sky is playing on a controller?
What happened to ur editor/quality
Missed you a lot Adam!
It‚Äôs only a matter of time...

Team Crafted: Ssundee‚Äôs Return
SKY I MISSED YOU FOR 3 YEARS
The nostalgia I love u dad
Sky is one of my favorite you tubers and it makes me said thinking about all he‚Äôs been through because he is not like any other YouTube i watch I have no idea how much longer he can do this and all i have to say is stay strong sky
THIS BROUGHT OUT MEMORIES I FORGOT EXISTED
Remembered watching since I was 14 now I'm 18.
I‚Äôm glad that Adam is uploading again, but I just hope he‚Äôs doing well
This is the sky that i known before
Happy that sky's back the nostalgia is REAL
I remember rewatching your prison escape with the tornado mod when I was a kid‚Ä¶ ahhh the good days of youtube but he doesn‚Äôt sound as excited but I don‚Äôt blame him, it would probably get boring playing the same game for 8 years 




Love you Adam!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
We missed you glad that your back üò¢üò¢üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÜüòÜüëåüëåüëå
i had a flash back when i read the title and i was like oh god yes.
Literally no energy or enthusiasm.
Might‚Äôve screamed after seeing that intro...
Remember when adam was so energetic lol
Wait so you didn't record the cops and robbers episode that you did with Jerome?
Omg, my whole childhood just flashed back. I‚Äôm so happy
sky, fam, like im happy to see the videos again so are a lot of people but fam  your magic is gone like you sound like you are sleeping in the videos which isnt that fun to watch its all up to you how you wanna do things but fam this just aint like one of your videos
You guys should check out wynncraft. Its a minecraft server that is a fully functional mmorpg. Honestly the coolest server ive ever played on
I've been watching Sky when I was 11 and I'm turning 19 this year, Oh man the happy memories this brings back to me.

THE OLD INTRO
I'm so glad you're back Adam

Ah Sky! My sister and I used to watch your Minecraft videos all the time!! Please continue!
Man this is crazy. I remember watching back in the team crafted days. Watching you evolve and watching your videos improve. Watching you release your first serious songs. Now I'm 17 and this is taking me way back. Keep doing what you do man.
Aay the old intro and sound quality
Man, this feels like middle school, Jesus Christ
The nostalgia from that intro

Who remembers skys hate for squids and his love of  butter budder
Remember the squids and budder??? Team Crafted?
I used to watch sky when he first started and I haven't seen his videos in years. I'm so glad that he hasn't changed much at all over the years.
Is it me or does Adam sound so disinterested and tired? Some reactions feel forced too
I love that Jerom is keeping Skys spirts up
I've been subbed since 2012 I was like 8 or so. You have been here when something bad happened and I have been calling gold butter for YEARS and it has become a regular thing when ever I play Minecraft.
All of the FBI is watching this vid
READ THIS!!!   -     PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOUR AGREE

Sky actually sounds happy. Nice
Ok hi I am a big fan
There's a plugging that isn't updated to the latsets version of my, so your fences are being weird. Downgrade to 1.12 and it should fix it.

y'all remember when sky said he wasn't gonna do minecraft anymore??
You're still around? I haven't watched one of your videos in YEARS!
Sky sounds so unhappy to play this game lmao
Sooo when are you gonna make RuneScape let‚Äôs play?
Little late to say this but I missed that intro good to have you back
Would you ever consider doing roleplays again???
Nooo adams a noob now
Jerome sounds so different it kinda sucks how he‚Äôs changed but I‚Äôm happy they are making videos again
Im happy that Jerome is a good friend to sky, and that he is there for him, That makes me smile,
This guy was my childhood
Dude I love your music, but not this......
Teamcrafted

I miss the music man. ;(
Jerome's voice pisses me off so much, idk why
Modded cops and robbers please!!
Adam changed a lot over the years. He seems more tired. Still like his videos those. He was my childhood even though my mom tried to take it away because of swear words, but I still snuck it in.

My older brother and i always used to watch your vids at 1:30 a.m. and trying not to get caught by any parents lol. Those were the good ol‚Äô days. I was about 7 when i started watching you. And now i am almost 13.  Thank you for returning. It means a lot to so many people, including me. You were a big inspiration throughout my whole younger childhood. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier without your laugh.

Wow first time watching in literally years...
Sky is subbed to tea series
I came here bc of a insta post.
Idk if it just me but sky doesn‚Äôt seem as enthusiastic as he used to be playing Minecraft
I really hope he keeps the bitrate the same as old videos for nostalgia reasons
Hi adam, how are you. I just want you to know you're doing great and people care about you. Have a good day.
Always here
Adam, I've been watching your videos since 2004 ish, I saw what happened with KSI he did a low blow with everything, heh I remember i once got banned from watching your videos because my mom watched your videos and heard you swear, guess what I didn't listen to my mom, imma be a supporter for you Adam...üíïüòá

I wonder if. Sky, bajan, Jerome, Jason, And ty can all do a collab again :D it‚Äôll almost be the old group, minus Quentin and Ian. Cause idk if they still make bids


Edit: oh god nvm I just found out what happened over the years. We lost Ian and Mitch to Fortnite, lost Quentin and Jason to idek. The only ones left are Jerome, Adam, and Ty
This videos feels like 2014 minecraft
Adam just sounds really bored :/

OMG, IT'S OBSIDIAN!
He fell off years ago
I thought it‚Äôs the skyblock in the thumbnail. I don‚Äôt like this type of skyblock I like the origianl
Jerome is still the "be loud and jingle keys into the mic" lad and Sky is the straight-man in what Jerome interprets as a magical world
Yas so good hahahahahahaha
I have missed this
Is this going to be a series?
Calm down Jerome
This is epic.
I thought he quit minecraft?
Rip Minecraft
Bacca? Is that what they‚Äôre called? It‚Äôs been so long...

Modded cops and robbers would be nice if you wouldn't mind
is anyone noticing how quiet Adam is? it's kind of weird. back in his videos he would be enthusiastic to the very end with his friends, always interrupting them, finishing a contagious and hilarious laugh. i don't know, i just noticed that little thing. i just really love Adam, he was always part of my childhood growing up, i just want what's best for him.
Glad he's back
Perfectwaaaaaaaa
Y u sound depressed my dude?
Ur ttelling me that this video doesn't seem off?
Thank you adam
I‚Äôm thirteen and you were the very first youtuber I have ever sall and you always made my day when it was going bad. When I was being bullied constantly in school you always remind me to stay happy and keep smiling. I would say that my childhood is coming back but that‚Äôs not it my livelihood is coming back!
This made me smile a real smile which is pretty rare these days
Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be dead?
What happened to ross
guys guess what! Sky isn't the only one back!!! SETOSORCERER IS ALSO BACK!!! though he been back for awhile but i want people more aware of him returning.
Anyone else feel like he more calm than he used to be less excited to play or so

A remember when I was 12 now in 18 and still smiling even though I don't even play this game anymore
OMG
The first Minecraft video I‚Äôve watched in 3 years
Bruh
Hi
DO SKYFACTORY
Watches cause reminded of childhood. Still disappointed that sky can‚Äôt make a cobblestone generator.
I want klub ice back!!
Hey react to you song new world and please return to your old ways
Play with preston or ross
Sky is depressed
Bring Ross back I beg
Wait, you still make videos?
i dont see anyone in the comments mention the fact the fences are all broken
Wait why is so trash now ?
It's so weird this man goes back and forth between old Adam and new Adam dude just pick one your actual fans will stick by you, this entire video is a fake persona you put on for views. Forget views and be you that's kinda why people liked you in the first place
OMG DO HUNGER GAMES
My childhood
You betrayed the 9 year olds !
Look SKY blocks the ball 
Then SKY blocks everyone on Twitter 
Afterwards SKY blocks everyone on Instagram 
After that SKY blocks everyone on Myspace 
Then at the end He Disappeared by BLOCKING himself
This is my childhood, I‚Äôm happy
DADDYS HOME
noice
JEROME
can u hear 10 year old me crying?
This is so weird to watch...
Is this not another re upload? Cus that‚Äôs dope if so
I am extremely hard
Island of the skies anyone?
Sky it be cool if you did a mod pack with some people, I remember the crazy craft days. You probably won‚Äôt read this but love you man, keep striving.
Hey sky I‚Äôm a long time fan who loved your videos as a kid and would spend literally hours watching your parkour maps and mod reviews, my favourite thing was your cops and robbers series I would watch those episodes for hours and they‚Äôd always make me laugh, your videos helped me through a lot of tough times and I know that‚Äôs cliche but you were a really important part of my childhood and I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, thanks sky
Adam seems like he's doing so much better!! It feels like he's gone back to the old sky and it makes me happy! Can't wait to see more!
I love how when ever Jerome does a video with Sky now, Sky is just like his child and Jerome is teaching him how to like do everything and has to be there to look after him
Eh ehhh eehhhhh LAPIS!!!
probbably Jerome and Sky are the last Mc youtubers that actually mostly contain MC content since we have no hope cause fortnite killed MC thanks man for the vid
Hungry games?
Bruh
No animal are harm in this video
My childhood
I remember when I would be watching him on my IPod touch when the YouTube logo was a TV
OMG OMG OMG OMG THE SHITTYNESS OF EVERYTHING I MISS IT
Adum could you do some thing with Ross in the future  (If you two are still cool I don't want to salt any old wounds) but it would be nices to see you do something with him again because you both singergised so well together and I miss that and now sanes your geting back to your old groove I just was hoping to see you try to reconnect with ever one you can you know
Thats...  Not how to make an cobblestone generator...
Adam can you please upload your Sky versus gaming GTA back Adam can you please upload your Sky versus gaming GTA back on YouTube
What is the iq
I hope he doesn't feel as burnt out as he sounds.
Ohhh my goddd thankk 
Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
ngl Jerome's energy made me realize the personas people put on back in my childhood. 

Not to rip on the guy but I guess nowadays I want something that's genuine
Ok
I used to watch him when I was 8 and I‚Äôm about to turn 17 this year üòÇ
He BaaaaaacCcccck
Childhood
Is this a new video or old
His doing his old voice and it‚Äôs sad
O yass
Hey sky I was just asking about doing Minecraft and...........oh............seems time doin it again, first time seein this again wanted to catch up and....... YAYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!
My video quality was literally at 480p so I thought it was like a classic Sky Does Minecraft video with the old crappy quality. But nope just my phone lmao.
it was really boring
omg (.>.)
Just a quick tip: You can make the cactus farm easier and cost less you just need sand, cactus and string; the string hold the sand up and you put the sand where you put the blocks for the fences. It uses less space and makes more money for your island :D Thanks!
All these returning minecraft content is great, I just hope that Adam is happy with what he does now.
Guys I think sky ran out of money so he started up again, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be enjoying it
Nice
The year is 2013 Sky and Jerome upload another video your childhood is complete
Nice
okay someone help me, i love minecraft but i dont see the point of vanilla minecraft t be honest
Oh hello childhood
Please bring SSUNDEE BACK
Im a kid
Sky coming back has made me realise that there's a whole generation of kids who are now around the age of 15-17 (or around there) that grew up watching sky. Really makes me feel like I'm a part of something. I missed this fam ;P <3<3<3 hope that other generations will be able to feel and experience the same kind of thing with this
Hey sky, im sorry i havent been the greatest fan lately, as i never visited you for more than 3 years. I looked back at my childhood and here I am. I just want to say how much of a influnece you were to me and you made days seem so much better under stress. I know you will prob never read this, but I might as well try.
FLUFFY!!!!! now where's Huskymudfish?
First of all the memories are flooding back and second of all is it just me or does Adam seem high asf in this?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm quite excited‚Äù (actually really depressed) Adam sounds really disappointed
My child hood
Is that stone generator thing a mod?
Wenn die soldaten
is this 2012?
Looks like someone needs money
3:41 the way that craft thoed
Sky does evertrhing doing minecraft again?
üëÄüëÄüòÉüòÉüòÉüòáüòè
Ee
my childhood
Does Adam make Minecraft videos again?
Ssundee is next to play minecraft
hey man, glad to see you back in making minecraft videos. I remember I used to watch you do mod reviews for this game, I hope you will gain millions of views again like you used to!
I feel rebuderd
Oh ma gaw childhood
Jerome try to make Sky happy.........
Uh can I join in x box or does it have to be pc?
adam sounds so sad.
Skydoesminecraft is the person that wanted me to play minecraft. And I just noticed that he's back playing minecraft glad I could see him make videos like this again. <3
So i saw that you are subbed to T-series.






This is a joke he is subbed to Pewdiepie
Childhood has reloaded..*
Me: YAAAAAAAAAAS

On the real tho...sky..all the memories are flooding back to me...you really helped my a lot with my depression when you posted and..this..feels great..I really missed you sky..I hope your doing better.. 

Signed your recruit of the sky army..
-Tawnni J.
Yay
Anybody remember skydoes minecraft hide and seek?
Sub to sky and Pewdiepie if you have a high iq
Haha it would be funny watching sky and jerome playing sky factory (thats the one that has a TON of mods its pretty complicated) since i dont think they are experienced with mods
It‚Äôs time for the reincarnation of god called skydoesminecraft
The nostalgia goes crazy but it‚Äôs kinda sad to see him re-uploading for money because why else would he post this?
Nobody likes Skyblock anymore, do skyfactory
Why does Adam sound so listless and sad?
Yay
Yay
I am so happy he‚Äôs back and playing with Jerome ‚ù§Ô∏è Personally even though I loved Ross, all of his older friends such as Jerome, Ssundee, TruMu, Deadlox and others were the best‚ù§Ô∏è
I feel like if sky comes back to making Minecraft videos I will 100% come back and watch
Wow Sky sounds like NetNobody
I know people grow up but when I saw Adam like this he became a toddler playing Minecraft
Can y‚Äôall do hunger games next
If you could somehow get Mudkip, BajanCanadian, Ssundee, or just any of the OG‚Äôs back then that would be legendary
Suddenly it‚Äôs 2012 and I‚Äôm watching this under my covers past my bed time trying to not get caught by my parents
still search for skydoesminecraft
Damn..6 hours ago and the video is up to 33K views, a youtube named Cory who just posted a vid 20 minutes ago already hit 70K views, Shows how much Minecraft went downhill from a global conquoring game to a sheer memory in our hearts
You guys should do prison Minecraft ssundee did it
He‚Äôs back I‚Äôm so happy
Omg he‚Äôs back! I don‚Äôt even watch Minecraft anymore but I‚Äôm just going to watch this for the sake of watching it!
sorry to say but your a dead Minecraft youtuber.
Bro why is Minecraft rising in popularity again? I mean, this isn‚Äôt a bad thing. But it‚Äôs just... strange.
i didn‚Äôt miss this to be honest
He's back ashidsndjxjehdxjcidejd
i am sorry, but the mic is very shitty and i know why. which is why i don't care at all
This is a sky I know still sounds a little down but hey I understand why
HES HIMSELF AGAIN
Is it just me or are sky and Jerome acting super professional with each other, compared to back when they made videos with each other all the time and they had lots of fun. Their relationship rn seems rlly professional where as before it seemed like they were actual friends
Mad lad.
His voice is so much higher.... gonna guess because of singing.
Is this an old video? Or is it new. If it‚Äôs new, I‚Äôm gassed.
Awwww....I just hope you‚Äôre doing it to make you happy instead of just for the fans.
I keep watching the new videos and feel like crying. Who else?
Brings me back to when i was 7 and always watched sky. But now im 13 i am happy that the old skydoesminecraft us back! üòÅ
Don't abandon people because of personal problems
I heard ssundee
When ksi destroys you with a diss track so you go back to minecraft
Sky and i
Baijancadian
NOT EVEN 10 SECONDS IN, I CRACKED UP AGAIN! XD
Glad your back.
Fortnite is dead minecraft is back
Do try not to laugh with youtube sensation red factor and berney and the sloth homeowner
I hope this is truly what you want Adam, you sound so tired. I hope you aren‚Äôt forcing yourself to play this game for us, please don‚Äôt make yourself miserable.
SKyYyYyYYyY!!!!!!!! I remember you from a long time I watched you when I was 9 years old now I‚Äôm 14 oml I‚Äôve been subbed for such a long time I just remembered
I‚Äôm a little late and this may be out of line but I need help or advice and I look up to you, but if you had to give one or two steps to help someone with what your going through because I don‚Äôt think I can handle it anymore it may seem like I want attention but I just want some advice or just a hint or something I‚Äôm sorry and you probably may or may not ever see this but I just need something
If only my switch could do servers... üò≠üò≠üò≠
Adam, you just hit my nostalgia button and oh god it feels good to be back
Is this a reuploaded video
and so my childhood returns once more.

its been so long!
Does this mean da hunger deans is coming back too. OMG!!!!!!
Do pixelmon or crazy craft like back in the day
Wow. So I started watching Adam when he was playing a lot more g mod than Minecraft but I liked the Minecraft videos more. I continued watching through the years until Adam quit. I thought "Hey, if that's what he's gonna do, I'll support him." So to know he's doing these videos which remind me of the older videos, is just a lot for me. Love ya Adam üíï
Good video, man! I hope your good now.
Im crying
This is giving me nostalgia
The NOSTALGIA
My brain hurts
no I‚Äôm not crying, that‚Äôs you.
Yess
Jerome is carrying this commentary lmao
Wait, so you play minecraft again?
Welp time to get people to join sky and make minecraft alive again, LETS GO
Tbh adam if you get bored of minecraft dont be afraid to mix it up take it from me nothing burns you out of a game than playing it non stop
Cool dood!!üòÄüòÄ

pleas do more :D
why ur game so broken lol
I‚Äôm earlyyyyy!!! Say hi to ur girl DarkStar here;3
I‚Äôm truly happy Adam is uploading, but I would like to know him and not know him as sky but adam
I just want to let Adam know how much I (and all his fans) appreciate his videos. Having my favourite YouTubed producing videos again. We all appreciate you doing videos and you are honestly my hero. You were my childhood and and many other peoples childhoods. You deserve so much more than you have you have countless people through tough times by producing 10-20 minute videos. And we all appreciate you so much
Hey sky
WHOO SKY ARMY IS BACK
My childhood
good to have u back
Is it on Minecraft PE?
So sky and Jerome are the only ones wanting to bring back team crafted?
Please prank jerome
Dude, THE NOSTALGIA!!!
Even the horrible camera quality oooooo gawd

2013 just hit me like a bus‚ù§Ô∏è

**totally didnt fall into a waterfall to save him self**
Sky you are playing on a different version than your server. Your textures are bugged.
I‚Äôm having flashbacks and I‚Äôm thinking about playing cops and robbers again

I think when you‚Äôre flying you mine really slow
Well isnt this a neat little pack of nostalgia.
YAS WELCOME BACK SKY üíúüíú
Your back in Minecraft
Holy crap
Adam is so confused
Do cops and robbers again
God, my childhood is back. I used to watch sky damn near every day playing Minecraft with friends, reviewing Minecraft mods, or just messing around for hours. Back then I was 12, I'm almost 16 now, and honestly I almost teared up not gonna lie. I'm so glad you're back Sky, I know I can speak for all of us in this army when I said that we are all going through a nostalgia trip right now. I'm so happy you're doing better Sky and just remember we're all here for you. <3
This comment section has such bad grammar.
Hey Adam, Could u possibly play some fortnite with SSundee and it would be so fun, and SSundee is very funny so you will really enjoy your time
Jerome is kinda annoying
I HAVENT SEEN THAT INTRO IN YEARS.... OMG I think I‚Äôm back to how I was because let‚Äôs be honest... non of us feel the same since summer 2014 ? Sky was making videos, minecraft wasn‚Äôt gay and there was no worries. Now there‚Äôs  responsibilitys and it‚Äôs just stressful, I watched the intro of this video and so much stuff dropped off of my shoulders... thankyou sky
This is my favert thing I hop you make moreüòâ
Adam can you do try not to laugh and I love your videos so much I always make me happy and tell Ross that he is always beautiful and to bother Max
Ah I missed that furry baka.
MY OCD THE CHESTS AND FANCES NOT JOINING!!

Why are you still doing Minecraft. Don't you realize what you've done. You're gonna make all the kids come back to the game and ruin it for everyone else dammit
Wow, I was pretty sure this would never happen! Cool to see a pair like this again. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying whatever you‚Äôre doing right now if you see this Sky. Or whoever reads this. Whichever

Can't wait for our new series to launch this weekend ;)

everyone's there talking about the modded stuff




Sky be like:   :l
Everyone in the team doing this while Adam runs around not knowing what to do.

Is it 2013 again?
‚ÄúHarvest their livers‚Äù 

Man, I love Jerome.
Holy molly he‚Äôs doing a mini game!!!
I love these videos but adam sounds exhausted and i dont want him to keep doing this if he doesnt want to.
Me: wow he brought try not to laugh back so much nostalgia

Nostalgia: hold my beer



Edit: wow thanks I've never got more then five likes
The whole vid u seem like u have no idea what ur doin'... Great vid thoüëå
I feel like Jerome is trying his best to make his friend Adam have fun
Damn what a friendship
Everyone yelling about diamond and emeralds and catalysts adam slowly making a stone pick axe great vid
"Hey mat you ready, yeah I got this stick"

Adam "that's how I feel"üòÇ

God: Nothing stays forever 

Minecraft: Hold my Beer
Still going and still uploading. RESPECT!
Nostalgia is hitting hard but somethings not there
The music
Sky I MISSED YOU I WAS WATCH SINCE THE FIRST EPISODE OF COPS AND ROBBERS
I love that you're back Adam. I've been watching for years and I've always followed you. I haven't watched your other Minecraft videos yet and I feel bad about that
Sky, Your videos are awesome üòÑ
Fluffy is back? 
a surprise for sure, but a welcome one.
The real question is, are mods showcases coming back?
That Intro Brought me WAYYYYY BACK üò≠üíÄ
When he said he‚Äôs going back to his roots he‚Äôs really going back. As to his mic quality, to his friends and just pure fun :)
It‚Äôs great to see you come back after all these years so I wish you good luck in the future
glad to see you with fluffy again adam!
it melts my heart to see you with your friends again!
So like, does anyone remember the phrase "Nar Nar" that sky said he wanted to make a thing? Example: "That's Nar Nar" or something to that effect.
Minigames are always great fun to watch. If the people playing them are also great, then even more so.
probably a joke but it says Minecraf in the description xd
Ur videos always bring me a smile üòÉ
Are you ok man you sound kinda sad I'm always open to talk I have every social media on the plant dm me
me: realizes that deadlox does fortnite videos with MR TOP 5
also me: jumps out window
edit: mr top 5: cReEPY  gUy cAmE tO my hoUsE
reality: a friend playing a prank on him
( I agree double trouble )

It's weird to see that sky grown up :( So glad I grew up with diamond swords and not golden scars.
"water makes you wet, fire makes you fired"
Me: It's called burning
Now this THIS RIGHT HERE is the OG stuff the memories are flowing in
Yea Jerry‚Äôs modded battledomes are kinda bad now no offense Adam
Btw Jerry didn‚Äôt teach Adam new PvP
The nostalgia...hurts...so much...you've got me tearing up right now ngl
The intro I havent seen in forever....
Me: Nostalgia
Everything has changed, The bad things are gone and everything now is just so good and nastalgic. Adam thank you!
i haven‚Äôt watched a Minecraft video from you in so long and when the video started, i immediately had to lower the volume XD i forgot how loud you are! (jk ilysm)
I was thinking, since you're now new to the whole scene again, this gives you an opportunity to try all the old stuff: cops n' robbers, parkour maps, maps with deadlox, etc. Go at it buddy!!!!
You Should Do A Calab With Ryguyrocky And His Friends (I Basicaly Want You To Do A Epidode Of Daycare With Them)
im so happy!
i feel like im gonna cry
THE INTRO. HOLY BAJESUS I MISSED YOU üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Also thx for being back man we missed you for the longest time and i know you helped me in some rough times and hope we can help you in any rough times you have
Ps I'd love to play on the servers with you and deadlox but I don't have a computer I only have an Xbox one ‚òπÔ∏è
Epic Jump Map (fan remake maybe) with Jerome and Ty (Deadlox) next??
Everyone like skys videos to suport him. He posiblly could be going through another depression time in life
Hmm this is oddly familiar good to see everyone brings back my childhood and also makes me cry a little
üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èüÖøÔ∏èüòÇüëåüò≠ü§óü§îü•≥ü§™ =my nostalgia and emotions

Jerome being all energetic
Sky:eHhHhhh, sure. Eh why not. Just gonna destroy this and that...uh huh. Ah yes. Mk
Intro: SKY. DOES. MINE-CRAFT. BOOOM
Man, this seems real classic, like, pre mini game craze kinda classic.
I love it
YES YES YES I LOVE YOU ADAM  i used to watch you since the roomates seris and all the try not to laugh seris!
Holy JESUS SKY YOU WERE IN AN ANIME CALLED TOKYO ESP?! AWWWWWWESOOOOOOME!!!!!!!
Hey! You Should Do A SCP Mod With CavemanFilms He's Been Doing alot of SCP Stuff.
It's been so long and you still have the same intro I've been watchjng since you still did the mail thing this is not even my old account I've been watching you since
Well keep it up
Alright. I've been subbed since 2011 where are my mod showcases?!
Jerome is so nice! BUT ADAM SOUNDS LIKE HES BORED but thats ok
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPy to see you okay again I wish you the best of luck and remember we're here for you.
Hey Sky! Just a random question you don't have to answer: Will you reupload the Project Happiness videos at any point? Loved those!
This is my first time watching you in like 6 years <3
Great video my man. Also, I hope you've been feeling better, you sound a little tired. Go at your own pace.
You should play rust, fortnite, csgo, rainbow 6 etc.
Nostalgia hitting me like FALCON PUUUUUUUUNCH
OMG THIS BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES 
TEAMCRAFTED MEMORIES!
Adam, gotta be honest. Sometimes even if you're tired or bored you just gotta push through. Trust me, the hard work will all pay out.
Nice video as always Adam. Keep up the good work dude. People enjoy your content. Always keep that in mind when making great videos dude. Don‚Äôt push yourself too hard ofc lol
i love these kinds of videos adam! but please rest. you sound tired, dont overdo it! <3
lmao but this was hilarious
This is all that's left? Yep, We're the pathetic dirty foursome and you make five








Nice to see the gang back together

Oh my gosh he's training the new Minecraft YouTubers

I love that you still play minecraft with friends
I was wondering sky if u could put the mods and texture packs you use in the description. Please and thank you !!!!
Man dont you just love having a video start with screaming XD
i love the random msgs that are just like yeah i dont know whats happensing
Is there any chance that you could bring back Minecraft Pirates Roleplay?  With a change of cast of course.  You could redo season one with a different cast of characters.
Man Sky was always my favorite back in the day. It's so crazy I'm in college now and I still like your stuff man. You deserve every like you get.
Don't worry EVERYONE... He's getting the hang of it since Day 1 Play 1 on minecraft...




You know... His first video
NOSTALGIA IS HITTING ME TOO HARD
This intro, JeromeASF, holy crap the nostalgia is so hard
"Fire would get your fired"

Umm, Jerome, I think that's called being burnt.
I got the video notification on the toilet... üòê
It‚Äôs a wild fluffy they are magnificent creatures
Its funny because i just watched a mini game bedwars video also the return of modded battles -3-?
My god...

I actulie thought this was a reupload of an old video
Hey man you will catch up to them, you will be the Legendary Butter king ouhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
He so calm its different but good
Just the beginning and the intro almost made me cry from nostalgia.
Gotta love the windows media maker
I have been crushed by nostalgia. Btw you sound a bit tired. You doing okay?

The text is killing me. It‚Äôs such a mood. Still have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Same Adam same.
‚ÄúHow notch intended ‚Äú
Oooo boy he intended for a LOT of things but that was definitely not one of them
hey can you play the game dead by daylight, i play it a lot and i think you'll like it. It reminds me of the phrase "SACRIFICES MUST BE MADE!!!!!!"
Oh my god the intro the nostalgia
wow thats a nostalgic intro
All he needs to do is have the "Noisestorm: airwaves" background music
It's yo boi skydoesthings BACK at it again with another video
That intro just decked me in the face
adam, we love you, we thank you for the amazing childhood. but you sound so tired dude. don‚Äôt do this for us. do it for yourself.
XD I CAN HEAR A PLANE AROUND THE 7 mark
This is reminiscent of older Skydoesmine videos
OMG SKY AND JEROME ARE BACK TOGETHER!! BRINGS BACK SO MAY MEMORIES üòÜ
i‚Äôve watched your videos as a kid back in 2011-2013, it warms my heart to know you‚Äôre still making the same great content :)
@Sky Does Everything love seeing you back to playing Minecraft
Man I watched you years ago when you were just starting out doing mod reviews. It's good to see you back in action and it's great to see you taking better paths. We've missed you man.
The old intro is back yes
Sees ‚ÄúRaven‚Äù

Hmmmm
Man that item is a good way of mining and love your videos their awesome and funny as always
seeing this made my day xd
nostalgia! NOSTALGIA EVERWHERE
YES!! I MISSED THIS SO MUCH!!!
Omg I miss this ima bout to watch all the new Minecraft series
FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GREAT CONTENT
THE INTRO IS BACK YAY
I dont know if I missed something but I have a question. Why dont you play with Ross anymore?
Adam sounds and plays like he's depressed üò•üò¢ just wanna see him energetic and alive again dude is literally my childhood.
Waiting for a Sky Does Everything CallMeCarson crossover
i love you adam, i know your having rough times. i love you.
Aww man you used to blow up all of a sudden everyone shifts to Fortnite
The Intro had me crying on the floor...I missed intros like these
Hey, if ur feeling better, u should try a game called ark, if only pve to not desl with stress
You guys should play bridges again!!! Those were some of my favorite videos.
I'm happy that he's back but he should push too hard and I'm also glad that jerome is very supportive on Adam's current situation. We hope that you can recover soon and other youtuber can support your cause.
Dud try hitting less often cuz of the 1.9 combat update
So like it's this joke right, Max is so salty if you drop them into a lake he can turn it  into a oceanüåä
I saw it pop up and squeaked I'm happy your posting again ^w^
Hey sky you sound upset and I understand why I just want to tell you that you're a good YouTuber you've been my inspiration and if it wasn't for you I would be sad you and a  YouTuber named Blitzwinger with only things in life that I was excited for and now I see the world only way so thank you sky keep doing what you're doing
Everyone's commenting on him sounding bored, I'm like... Meh on it? I think Adam's just calmed down a crap-ton from therapy, or possibly something similar.
you should play fortnite sky does every thing
Lmao you NEED thatguybarney because you can legit just look at his skin and laugh
I‚Äôve missed you so much glad to have you backüòÉ!!!!
Also where's ross...you still friends with him???
Oh damn the old intro is really sticking
When are you going to post season 2 of pirates
I MISS THE INTRO SO MUCH MORE THAN I THOUGHT
Who wants him to do a modded series? Or join other youtubers SMP?
I need ross joke weres is luigibut still i like ur vid
Did you know you are a good person?
Good to see you doing better love the content keep it up been subbed since cops and robbers
First YouTuber that I saw was you and your vids made me very happy. ps they still do. I checked out my oldest phone, an iPod , and I had like parkour maps with Truemu and deadlox, cops n robbers and survival games screenshots of your thumbnails like almost every üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Even when you sound so tired you‚Äôre still funny.

Jerome: AHHHHHH
Adam: hey. 7:09
Honestly I rly don't think it's the fact that he's tired I think he's just now getting back into the utube bizz so he's just quiet & learning how to do it. 

It seems that he's restarting just from a disadvantage this time
you guys have no life to click on a video notification so fast
Go at your own pace man, you shall one day rise like a Butter Phoenix! Just gotta take your time, sounded pretty tired is why I am sayin this. But we really do appreciate the upload, hope your treatment is going well and that your day is great.
I WAS THE 420th LIKEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i love you sky
There‚Äôs an attack timer for 1.9+ so swinging atks won‚Äôt do much
This awesome sky I am still going to watch you always even though I am 20 and still single. I already can't believe I am 20.
As I watched this perspective I started to feel so bad for Adam
Sky i have one word to say thankyou
4:42 But you're not on fire the fire is on you! Lol
Adam sounds so tired, Jerome was trying his best to cheer him up and that makes me so happy Lmao
Hey Sky, if you want an editor for your videos, hmu, I won't charge anything. Like this comment so Adam can see it!

First...
Fluffy boy your back

Dude, don't push yourself! You sound so dead tired. We understand if you need to relax
This gives me so many happy memories w also does this remind anyone else of Battle Dome?
DO A PARKOUR MAP
Yeah no, guys he's not okay. This video and his emotions in it all feel forced as hell. He sounds genuinely tired. If your a really old fan you'll know in the past when he played these minigames he would scream his head off and call Jerome "fluffy." Now he sounds so tired and sad. 

Sky don't force yourself if your not up to it yet. Me and most of these former minecraft kids will watch you till we're thirty just because of what you went through.
Try to do more stuff with aphmau and Ross
I am so glade you are back
BLADE YUSSS
Hopefully we can see u an Jerome and Minecraft universe and deadlock do a park core make together again
Sky, are you gonna play with mitch and quinton aswell?
jerome is cool for playing with him still
For Adam all it takes is a couple identity crises to get back on track
The intro hits me right in the feel
Star platinum
BATTLE DOME ITS BEEN TO LONG
I just want to see you and Jerome curse and make actual funny jokes
Id love more of this

Nostalgia hit me hard

everyone who hit the dislike button had their devise upside down and tried to hit the like button but instead hit the dislike button
Collab with BajanCanadian again
Damn.
Sky don't spam click when attacking, it does more damage because Mojang added cooldowns to weapons.
I haven‚Äôt watched you in years
It‚Äôs incredibly awesome to have you back
yayayayayay
Remember when this man quit youtube?
MINECRAFT IS BACK
I dont recognize 90% of the people here
It‚Äôs.... Minecraft I‚Äôm so so happy üòÄ
Adam is like Todoroki
Hes back
Take a break and rest
It‚Äôs so weird to hear him so calm during a battle dome
Why did i think this was golf?
I'm so old
The only reason I like this is nostalgia, and I hate myself for it
Butter
Wow jeromeasf and skydoesminecraft. I remember the cops and robbers days thee old days oh how I long for them back. The nostaliga hit me harder than a belt
FLUFFY
Yay old sky is back
what year is this?
It's back
I want more plz
The baca!
and so, after a long time of rapping and playing fortnite, adam, or his youtube alias "skydoesminecraft," returns to make more content...
So sad sky
another fun video i love watching your videos sky!
This is awseome.
Hi
Neat
So you're back?
Almost first
How many people here have watch Sky since they were 12?
Kkkk
Skyyyybro
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg üò≠üòÑ
Adam!  One.  Point.  Nine.  Combat.  The rules changed after 1.9.  You can't spam anymore, otherwise you only do half a heart of damage.  See that little sword meter that appears under your crosshair whenever you swing something?  Wait for that to fill and disappear, then you can maximize damage.
Nostalgia
What I wouldn't give to go back to 2014
üòû‚úå
:)
I CANT
It‚Äôs like the good old days
opps
Do a cops and robbers
Oops üòÇ
üåÆTACOüåÆ
How bout pixelmon cuz it‚Äôs still pretty fun.
#adamdoesntneedtoknowwhattodotowin


remember to take a break whenever you want one because we care about you, i watched your videos when i was younger and i always died of laughter, but when i saw you sad i was sad because someone i loved was broken down because of people i didnt see for who they were, remember... minecraft, music, whatever you wanna do, i will always support you... we all will, because even if you dont think it, every single one of those 11 million and more people care about you, we all love you, not sky, but adam... if adam wasn't here, then we wouldn't even have sky, so its not sky who we should love, its adam who we should love


ill cya later as one of many recruits who love you, goodbye
My Childhood has been repaired
Oops
Hello
All the people that are saying that he‚Äôs seems ‚Äútired‚Äù need to chill. Watch his update from a month ago. This was pre recorded and he‚Äôs currently at a center to help his depression stop freaking out about it. He‚Äôs fine.

Woooo

oops
Hi
Hi
Flufffy
Okay Adam what kind of weed are you on, why are playing minecraft???
What is this freight train of nostalgia
Neinkraft
God, Adam cannot force a smile to save his life and it really shows. If anything, Sky should join the Achievement Hunters or something just because he could probably be more expressive and true to himself there. Also he's kinda like a younger version of Geoff Ramsey considering they've both had relationship issues and both are loving fathers. It's a farfetched idea, but it's just something so crazy it might work?
Chicken
But fr are you ok?
Oops
Me like
Nobody tell him to not spam the sword
Im gonna cry. Its so. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Cool
Ty‚Äôs foot
Cool
Hey bro, if ur not feeling good then take some time please, you sounded tired (no offense). We will all be waiting here and supporting you no matter what! #skyarmy
Ay sky I have watched you a long ass time and u don‚Äôt sound happy to play this game right now u know there is other games :P come on buddy don‚Äôt try to hard
I remember when I used to watch Sky when I was 5 because I am 11 right now
PLEASE LISTEN. you probably have a 0% to read this, but I want you to hear me out. Minecraft has a new combat system, there is now a penalty for clicking too fast. let me explain. do you notice that tiny sword icon below the cross at the center of the screen? well whenever you attack, it quickly appears on the screen and fills up, the more it fills up, the more damage you will do. if it fills up all the way, then you do a powerful sweep attack that can hit multiple enemies. this is why you shouldn't spam click, because the bar doesn't have enough time to fill up even a little bit, so you do astronomically less damage overall. I know you won't read this, but I sincerely hope you will learn it at some point... thank you
I'M hERE
Hellooooo
If Bajan, Husky, Dedlox and Sparkles we‚Äôre here I would literally die of nostalgia
So no cops n robbers?
He's not tired guys, he's just high
are we back in 2015?
YAY
Un private the sky vs gaming videos or at least make them unlisted.
Oh dear
Only true OG's remember minepranks
Man if you dont like minecraft dont do it. People like us who have watched you from the start will support whatever you do. But when you do these, as much as we like seeing the old gang together, we can tell you arent into it anymore and it hurts us. Do you bro
bajancanadian isnt with jerome ?
Ay
Yo
Yo
gg
Love
Is it just me or is the quality of the Minecraft videos decrease after Sky came back?
Adam give me a galaxy s10 plus prism black 128gb and I'll teach u how to play minecraft
Hey I know you probably won‚Äôt read this Adam but I honestly love your vids. I have been watching your videos since the third episode of sky does Minecraft OG. I would use my moms YouTube account to watch then I made three other accounts. I just have one question. Will you max, Ross and the others ever make a video together again?
Is it just me or does anyone else think that Adam sounds either tired, or depressed? Cause I know its been a loooonngggg time since he played Minecraft, but still just kind of listen to how he was before, it's just not the same
Welp
How many Likes can this comment get for Adam to do a TRY NOT TO LAUGH,plzzzzzzzz
I‚Äôm confused...is this spleef or hunger games?
Hii
wouldn't it be epic if he made a group of popular minecraft youtubers and they made videos together
Don‚Äôt blame adam because he did bad things SQUID brain washed him for revenge.
I still love you man, but you have kinda lost your spark. I just watched some of your old videos and you sound way less happy in your newer videos than your old ones. Edit: Accidentally clicked finish before I was done, but please don't force yourself to much man. Just be happy and go at your own pace. Please don't let depression weigh you down.
Where‚Äôs ssundee and bajanü§ßüò¢
Not what I thought u looked like when I was 5
Hey Adam, I know you have been on quite a journey. It's been rock bottom for you, but I want you to know that I am so proud of you. I remember when you uploaded so many videos and hearing your voice, I knew you were faking it. When you crossed out your icon, I knew you were hurting. I didn't realize what was wrong and I was worried for ya tbh. You don't even know me XD. But I've been there, three times actually. Treatment was horrible, but it saved my life. I struggle with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and compulsive eating disorder and had to deal with so much pain, trying to self medicate just like you. I wanted to give up, but I looked up and saw my family, my friends. People that cared. I still struggle, but I know I have people to go to when I feel alone. All I want to say is that you have people around you who support you and love you. You have 11 million recruits right by your side. Don't forget about your support. Stay strong, Adam.  (Sorry for the long message)
Um Adam, why are you subbed to tseries?
You sound kinda sad like different than you use to be it‚Äôs weird but maybe I‚Äôm trippin
5:43 SSundee will remember that
You sound tired man. If you‚Äôre really not enjoying all of this, don‚Äôt force yourself man. We‚Äôll all support you.
Dude,can you play with ssundee again? Pleaseee?
Now put your name back to skydoesminecraft
SSUNDEE Would be triggered!
Ye sound lik u dunt care wut de fek
What ever happened to Minecraft? :(
Guys, stop freaking out, you heard Adam he wants to play minecraft again, he probably just prerecorded the episode while he was suffering from the side effects of his medication chill.
IM HERE!! PLEASE DON‚ÄôT SAY YOU FORGOT AFTER 5 YEARS,
The old sky does Minecraft still in there he still got it
Hey sky do you not play UHC in minecraft with YouTubers
Yay
Yay
Take a break if you need to man dont tire yourself
This is proof that God exists. SkyDoesMinecraft is back
If your tired of Minecraft, change to terraria. I think it‚Äôs more your taste in gaming
Yo Adam, if you‚Äôre not feeling too good please don‚Äôt push yourself to post content. I, as well as most of you followers, are more focused on how you feel whether than the content you used to create. We are thankful for you everyday :)
Like the other guy said dont try to hard no one is forcing you to make videos
Can you try to play with ssundee
You don't sound as happy as you used to be in ur vids...take your time don't force yourself to make vids
Sky you sound tired. Don‚Äôt rush it post when you want to don‚Äôt feel rushed
What happened to Ross playing Monopoly in 2015 also what happened to Hey guys sky here
Adam you sound really bummed or bored idk y but if its cuz hate minecraft dont play it play something fun or u enjoy
Just so you know, you can't swing all the time with your sword anymore. If you look under your crosshair when you swing, you will see a recharge for the weapon
üòäüòäüòä
Adam if you'd like to take a break from minecraft we understand. Do anything you want. Idc if its a vlog, a skit, or if its another game.
It‚Äôs kind a weird movie just skipped a lot but other than that it‚Äôs pretty cool I‚Äôm glad you and Jerome are back together
GET BACK WITH SSUNDEE PLEASE
ADAM DONT SPAM YOUR SWORD
I‚Äôm like a little girl on Christmas thats really excited for a present and the present is him uploading
Guys, remember, he's in treatment right now so it'll take him a while until he reads these comments.
you're actually playing with the bois, dude chieldhood nostalgia man bring back team jelk!
ADAM. DONT. SPAM. CLICK.
Sky army baby wooo!!!!
Sky, you sound extremely bored and unenthusiastic about doing this. Please dont feel like you're forced to keep playing minecraft. Play what you want to play. If that's not minecraft, then that's okay
Is it just me or does Adam just sound normal..? That's just how he talked before the "HEY GUYS SKY HERE WELCOME TO DO NOT LAUGH EPISODE 246" times
Adam dont force youself to do this we will support anytjing you want to do dont do stuff you dont like you sound well board and exsusted and tierd
Adam are u good? U sound a bit tired or bored. Are u ok now? cuz i saw that stream where u were crying. Anyway i luv u
God this brings nostalgia i just came back cause i was bored and i didn't even know you started doin minecraft anymore i remember seein that goodbye vid and i thought it was just over for the minecraft vids. Good to have you back sky
The og fans never leave their hero. Don‚Äôt force yourself to play if you don‚Äôt want to, Adam. We all understand the struggle you are going through, as a matter of fact, some of us are going through depression as well. If making Minecraft videos makes you unhappy, you can always do vlogs or something. We‚Äôd love to see what is going on with your life. Like if y‚Äôall agree üòÅ
Damn KSI really ended your career so bad that you had to go back to Minecraft.üò±üò±üò±. You‚Äôre such a hypocriteüòÇüòÇ
Couch potato
I do really love this but please be a bit more energetic next time!
I'm srry adam I dont find amusing anymore when you were hilarious all the time you sound bored af tho
We get it, you watched Sky during summer break when you were 12. no one cares.
Geez when u said u were back i didnt think once a month
This is like stepping into a time machine and finding myself at 12 years old watching Minecraft lets plays at 2 am on summer vacation... Thanks Sky
dissapointed in the amount of views this had. it deserves millions. this is revoloutionary that hes playing minecraft again, with the same intro.
This video had a lot of important topics, but can I just take this post to appreciate his use of 'whom'?
Sky : Returns to Minecraft

Minecraft YouTubers : careful, the legends back.
Jones Brothers: Back together
Miley Cyrus' wing: on 
Adam: Playing minecraft


Truly the gold age- or should i say..Butter age :DDDD
If you know :
Sky is good at content making when multiplaying with his friends. When he is alone, story teller.
"See you later recruits"...Im in a zone of major nostalgia and happiness
0-0 I can‚Äôt believe it Adams playing minecraft again....





THE GODS HAVE AWNSERED OUR PRAIRIES
i love the degraded quality in the video calling back to the early days
old intro + No background = nastoliga

Also i notice how in Every video they try to explain 1.9 xD
I'm crying I miss this so much. My memories are all coming back to me. We'll go through this together I've learned The hard way of life since I was born I would watch you everyday to make me feel better and it's helped me some so I appreciate it. Fighting SKY ARMY
Stay strong Sky. We love and support you.






Edit: no homo
This takes me back to when I was 9 or 10.... ah, the memories. Good to see you back man
You don‚Äôt know how happy I was to hear that intro.
2:36
attacks llama thinking nothing will happen


"OMNG IT SPITS"
I am so glad you are back!! You are the first YouTuber I watched. I have been a fan for 7 years and have loved everyone of your videos. 



I know I need to change my name

growing up, he was my hero and my role model. and honestly? he still is. he‚Äôs made mistakes, but he‚Äôs fundamentally a good person. he‚Äôs trying so hard to better himself. I hope that one day he‚Äôll be truly happy
All that god has to do now is bring back one more thing.

Better make a bed soon or else there will be an unpleasant surprise waiting for you in the sky
OMG he even did the sky squid voice.this man is great and i hope he gets betterüòäüëç
Glad I grew up with a diamond sword instead of a golden scar
I just wanna know if your still friends with jess





Btw your the best :3
Take a shot every time Adam makes a new craftingtableüòÇ
When you killed the chicken I was like THUNDERMUFFIN NOOOOOOOOOO
I am one of your soldiers in the sky army and have been for 8 yearsüòû
I think I speak for everyone here when I say we‚Äôre glad to see your back and making us laugh and not caring for what the haters have to say and doing what you love to do! Keep up the amazing work!
The bit with the squid brought me more amounts of nostalgia and happiness than ive felt in a really long time thank you so much for that ‚ù§Ô∏è
jesus you in my left ear scared the heII out of me
I‚Äôm really happy hear that you are getting help! I used to watch you videos all the time in middle school and a little bit in high school. But it looked like you were going down hill, and I seemed like I lost one of my hero‚Äôs, so it brings me so much joy to see you getting help with your mental health and to see you making videos with Fluffy and deadlox.
You can do this Adam. I have come back to the SKYARMY!
Combat update: waiting a second or two between swings of swords increases damage output (there‚Äôs a meter under your cursor that shows you)

Also axes now do more damage than swords but are swung slower
If you want some tips:
-Swords have a cooldown now (the white bar in the middle after you swing them). Wait for the cooldown to end before swinging again for maximum damage.
-CTRL is the run button now, and also allows you to swim underwater, and through one-block hopes underwater.
-Alpacas are basically useless, and are only good if you plan to be moving around a lot.
-Water physics have been updated, and a lot of old XP grinder designs are obsolete because of it.
-There's new hostile and passive mobs underwater. Drowned are water zombies that can throw tridents and deal a ton of damage, and dolphins are a thing now.
-There's shipwrecks, which all have loot in them.


..Thats all I could think of. Good luck, Adam!
here's my piece of advice, learn the new combat system.
also, WE LOVE SKY!
and welcome back
That was me that got you in jail üòé
Adam, I think you should no something
I get really bad anxiety but I don't get depression from it. There was a time were I was really depressed in 7th grade cause of growing up and not controlling my panic attacks and uncontrollable anxiety (and I was also bullied through  the whole year. Gonna be honest, it was bad enough were I almost snapped and punched them in the throat but luckily I kept my calm so it didn't really happen lol) but I'm fine now and am in 10th grade. I hope you will be okay as well, please take care of yourself love your vids üôÇ
When he was only in my left ear, it freaked me out. Lmao
You should play 2B2T Adam and see how long you can survive
Sky: talking about serious stuff

Also sky: are those llamas?
Only true Adam fans will remember this,
words cant explain how much i need this series right now. thank you so much for doing this :) i wish you the best üíï you can do this
14:04 it... it feels nice to hear that again, things change, people change, and I hope you‚Äôre changing for the better now. But I hope that outro never changes, it‚Äôs perfect, always has bean and always will be.
Advancement :

‚ÄúFrom the ground up‚Äù
bro there's no way to make this not sound cringey, but thats kinda okay because it reminds me of me when i was cringey back in 2011 and would watch these videos. 
bruh, i fucking miss this. i miss just sitting down and finding a video from sky to watch. not because he's the best there is, but because i feel it. sky, you just went on a long rant about self medicating and all that, and i realie what a similar position im in, except im still in denial lmao. but god i just miss hearing your voice saying positive things like that and being happy because adam just has that effect to make people smile. he's really good at it, and i love it. and thats why i always enjoyed him, because he could always get me to smile at a time where i didn't have a lot of reasons to smile. and I'm just so happy your back, or as back as you can be while in treatment, but im glad to have him be apart of my life again.
Omg YAAAAS. The return of a GOD.
This dude has balls to tell us his story don't gudge him and why would u get 70k on your recent vids and you have 11m subs 




Damn u fortnite
4:42 starts rapping
4:46 casually dies 





Adam, depression is a hard fight, I hope you can find the solution I couldn‚Äôt!
1 this was like super real and I almost cried. 2 is anyone going to tell him about the wait bar thing for the attack!?
Adam u have our full support and we will always be in ur corner. Keep up the good work!!
Hi sky been watching since team crafted so glad you have been recording with Jerome just finished watching the latest never have I ever video
'Doughnut' worry, we understand.

You probably got told this by a couple hundred people, but don't spam click, wait until the sword in the middle is full. Think of it like a short ranged bow.
I love you.

With kind regards,

Another Adam
Adam: ‚Äú[...] the moment I realized that-‚Äú
Ad: ‚ÄúSmart dogs can‚Äôt stop distracted driving!‚Äù

When the old intro played I actually screamed on the inside because of how freaking happy I am rn
You‚Äôre so different
You sound more genuine when playing
Everything about you, your tone, what words you use, and how you pace yourself
It‚Äôs calmer and more relaxed
I think it would help you if you looked up the Combat Update. Thanks for this series btw. What a throwback
Glad you're back and getting better, or butter. You helped so much back in the dayszzzzz
OH THE OLD INTRO MY CHILDHOOD BURNS WITH MEMORIES
If you can, maybe in the future could you upload with Mitch cause he back but if you don‚Äôt that‚Äôs fine
Bro it is like you know I only have a left earbud
Came here for obligatory nostalgia to discover this? SKY I LOVE YOU!
I literally haven‚Äôt been here in like 3 years omg it‚Äôs been soo long!!
GOD, I MISSED YOU, OLD INTRO.
Jokes aside, remember to take care of yourself Adam, we love you!
Had to make sure this vid was new
"see you later recruits"
made me tear up.
the outro made my day man, I haven't heard it in years and its great to actually watch and hear the outro and intro
Depression is a hard fight, Adam. I myself am having trouble with depression for the past year. I feel just like you,
I hope your depression will be gone, and you‚Äôll just be happy once again. I had alot of friends, to the point where I
Only have my 4 best friends. We all are going through this with you sky.

~To your subscriber, Ultra.
Welcome back sky we all missed you .
I'm confused, is this a reupload?
My god. Thank you for continuing these series! Hope you feel better, because i wasnt caught up with anything but once again thanks for continuing this.
Eating perk raw is nostalgia
The attack system is different now. You cant just spam your sword at enemies anymore. There is an attack bar by your cursor. You need to wait for it to be full to do full damge
The Intro then the see you later recruitsüò≠üò≠üò≠ im crying
Take your time and go slowly, recovery is not immediate. Thank you for being open and straight with us, hope you feel better
Protip: Wait like a sec before attacking again (the more the sword in the middle of your screen fills up, the more damage you do)
For those of us who held that light for you, that you were coming back to us Sky. We're all still here. Stay strong dude. We're all here for you

After 1.13 you can swim easier by sprinting
In other words, go underwater, do the same thing you'd do to sprint, and now you're properly swimming
Sees childhood hero play Minecraft again after years 

Gives a heartfelt salute
i thought i was 10 again, reliving my moments but no its real
I hope that you connect back with the people you've lost contact with.
Tip: Wait until that little sword on you're screen is full so you can do maximum damage on a mob. (So dont spam clicküôÉ)
7:03 oh boy I just heard some names for the first time in a long while. And even though it‚Äôs about a serious issue I can‚Äôt help but feel nostalgia
4:42
sky talks about weed while fighting a skeleton
cuts into him in a forest with no items and max health saying "for me personally "
That intro?!?? It‚Äôs been forever!!!!! Childhood returning
Adam whoa-
I know I don't know the stories. I forgot about you until 3 days after you quit. I've been here since the mod review days.
I care about you. I'm glad you know how to be better. I believe in you.
Honestly love these deep/funny nostalgic vids. A blast from the past plus some good convos. And many laughs cause you are you again how you were which was the best. AND THAT INTRO! üòéüëå
I love this. This series not only is nostalgic for me, a great timepass video, something to make me happy, AND a video to help me relax BUT IS ALSO an extremely informational video and something that really hits hard. I really appreciate this and it really hits...

ALSO i wanna add that i really appreciate how he uses his combat just like me xD
I died laughing at the start with the left ear thing and idk why lol thanks sky hope you get better
Omg left ear lmaooo I had my headphones on üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey Sky they updated the combat system so that when the bar under the cross hair is full and disappears you do more damage when you swing so you cant just swing non stop. Helpful tip numero uno .
Sky: Talks about Mental Therapy
Spiders: KKLLSSSSS KLLLSS
Sky: whUOOOHhh
Attacks skeleton 
Instantly cuts to him at spawn
You should try getting the original adventure map squad back and play an adventure map again
Sky, I pray that everyone will support you again. Please be better soon. :(
Glad you are back! I used to watch your videos everyday. They helped me with my depression.
Once a part of the Sky Army, always part of the Sky Army.
Thank you i love YouTubers who express and imform us what is actualy going on so again txs
Im glad your back ;D.
does u even combat bro




wait for the meter under your crosshair to fill so you can do full damage every swing.
Hey Adam you should finish making that Iron Golem from 2012!
This is the Adam I remember. Thanks for coming back!
#LeftEarStuff is the greatest hashtag ive ever heard, love you Adam! been with you since the old Mod review days, hope treatment goes well, just know i support you all the way :)
For a second, I thought that you were going to start a roleplay
(Mainly when I saw the thumbnail)
2k19 UNIRONIC MINECRAFT REVIVAL IS REAL, THE PRODIGAL SON HAS RETURNED.
There‚Äôs so many things I want to say, but I‚Äôm not going to. The one thing I will say though is that I‚Äôm extremely proud of you Adam, for who you were and who you‚Äôre becoming.

I wish you the best in your recovery :)
"Hey everybody what's up its me in your left ear again" lol my right headphone is broken
This video is a time machine
i looked up cops and robbers minecraft to find sky all over again and wow, so much has changed since the last time i saw him in 2017. im glad he is doing better now.
The days where Minecraft was popular, and before I became a content creator...They're hitting me real hard...
Thanks, Sky, for the memories
We‚Äôre proud of you
I loved this intro and im glad you brought it back.
Sky we all love you and are here for you man at least I know I am keep working man best of luck
Oh, that intro gave me 2010 flashbacks
This feels so nice to watch. I've struggled with depression and anorexia/bulimia for years. It's hard to admit that you have a problem. I wish you the best.
Seeing that intro hit me..
Sky Does Minecraft 2: Electric Boogaloo
I feel like my childhood innocence has returned to me. I wish nothing but happiness for you Adam, you served as a major source of happiness for me for a really long time, and for that, I've always been supportive of you, and I always will be.
Thanks so much for all of this, man. It takes guts to admit the mistakes and not-so-good things that's happened- on either side of the coin. I'm so happy you're going through with treatment and just being reflective on all you've gone through. I appreciate all you've got to give as of now, and am so excited to watch this series progress just as much as you. 
See you next video or post or whatever else, Sky. Supporting you through this 'cause I know 100% that you've got this. <3
;-; seeing play Minecraft makes me happy
I feel like I am Rewatching Sky Does Minecraft videos. But Stay strong Adam. We care for you.
Adam i love you. I would always watch your videos as a child and to see your progress is amazing. The skyarmy is always here for you. Do you adam and we all love you, youre a sexy beast. Stay strong xx
Sprint underwater to swim
Wait between hits (you see that sword bar) to do that triple hit thing.
There are dolphins
And shipwrecks
And a trident
And water zombies
Adam: Are these lamas? They added lamas in here?
Me: Just wait till he finds out they added dolphins, polar bears, and pandas among other things
I threw my phone when I saw the old intro, HES BACK
You are beyond brave, Adam. I can‚Äôt imagine opening up like this to complete strangers with all that you‚Äôre going through. You made me smile and laugh back in the old days, and you still do, but now you also inspire me in a unique and incredible way. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also the intro, the squid narration, and the ending all had me nostalgia tripping üò≠
Tips:

-when fighting mobs, it‚Äôs actually preferred that you wait for your sword to ‚Äúreload‚Äù so it does more damage and may hit multiple mobs at once rather that just spamming
I feel like crying seeing Adam so depressed üòû

Your friends and fans ‚ù§ U!
welcome back sky :')
ps: stop spamming your sword let it cooldown for more damage
Me: only has left earphone in
Sky does everything: "hey everybody what's up, it's me in your left ear again"
dont spam when fighting things, hit when the sword in the center of the screen charges up
Regular Pooh: who

THE PROPHECY!!!
talks about depression and serious Stu-
OMG LLAMAS
This is good for you Adam! You're doing great and this is a big step for you! Addiction a d recovery is a constant battle and I'm proud of you to decide to keep going!
I really love how Adam talks about something super serious, gets distracted by something stupid in the game





Then just cuts back to his serious topic
Hey sky since 2012 as a child I've been watching your videos
Sky: Go and beat up my chicken roommate
Me: what did the chicken do to you? üòÇ
Deppression is hard man an slef medicating deffentitly was not the way to go (talking from personal experience) but atleast uve learnes an will become a better person from this
lot of whoms and I love watching you play minecraft again
In all honesty 





WE LOVE SKY, NEVER STOPPED, NEVER WILL STOP
I understand what you're going through to a degree. I used to also be incredibly hypercritical of others due to some self righteous superiority complex. Luckily I was already socially isolated at the time so I had nothing else to lose, but nonetheless I still understand. I've also been through depression as well. I came out of it in the same direction you're going in, and all I have to say is power to you man. Its a journey that I'm still on, and honestly never ends, but its not the end that matters its the journey. Good luck!
Aye this some real nostalgia but only 73k views to many of the sky army has left
This hit my heart, oh dear. I love you Adam! Never be afraid to reach out to us for help. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great video but when fighting right under your crossair theres a sword wait for that to recharge after every hit and youll get the max damage you can get
when you started talking about kermit i started get feels. man, i hope you continue getting better.
Sky, some quick advice! The new updates have changed how melee combat works! Its better to strike, then let the little sword under your crosshair refill, then strike again, as rapidly attacking now does less damage. Also, the sword and axe have special attacks. The sword has a sweep that was seen a few times in the video, and the axe has a sort of a 'crushing blow' attack, which I think is triggered by striking midair. I don't really know about the axe one as I haven't really tried it all that much lol
WE LOVE SKY
That's right I read the description
I really love that you feel comfortable being open and vulnerable with us. You're the greatest!
hey, thanks for coming back, I've been watching you since like 2012 and watching this whole roller-coaster, watching your videos helped me a bit through some tough times and I'm glad you're getting help. gotta say, this is a great thing, I'll keep watching your videos till you stop making them.
Hey Sky. I‚Äôve been a fan ever since your mod pack videos in 2011. You lit up my childhood with a lot of happiness and joy. I was depressed at a very young age and I watched you because you made me feel better. When you stopped making videos, I then became depressed for a long time again. When I was at my lowest I watched your old videos and I laughed. I turned on notifications while you were still gone and I knew you would post again. When I got the notification, I cried tears of joy to know that my childhood is back. But from this video, I understood you about your depression. I love you man. We love you man. 
please release your album to vinyl. id love that. I love your album so much bro
i'm glad to have talks with you again <3 even if i'm not there here's a hug!ü§ó
PC updates faster than xbox. The beta for xbox has amazing villages so you may have them in your world but I have no clue if it has updated yet. ‚ò∫
Your amazing. Thank you for trusting us and I hope we all can be of help in finding yourself.
I miss this intro 0:07 ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠
I used to smoke a lot of pot... oh are those lamas
Sky I just hope you get better and become happier again.
I loved watching you growing up and I hope you deal with your depression and become healthier again
-From a Fan
PS: I don't know how to write that well please bear with me (see what I did there)
This is any deeper than I expected but I really enjoy it Sky, little bit more mature content for a more mature audience that grew up. Thanks man!
The intro tho.üò¢ *single tear runs down cheek.
He needs to bring back his webcam if he can
I love your vids and can't wait for modded survival series
Tips
‚Ä¢ Swords have a cooldown and continued swinging will lower their damage output.
‚Ä¢ Woodland Mansions are huge three story buildings in forest that can contain lots of items bur are haunted by Ghost Mobs, there's the Indicater that drops iron axes and emeralds, and magic ones that drop a totem of undying which revives you on death of it's in your hand. The magic ones cam summon extra help to be careful.
‚Ä¢ Horses that are struck by lightning become skeleton horses with skeletons riding them. Defeat the skeleton to get the horses. They have 1/2 a regulars horse's HP but can walk underwater.
‚Ä¢ You can eat dried seaweed to restore 1 hunger point, and it is the fastest food to eat.
I am gonna be real with you: playing a game that made many peoples childhood is the best cure for depression. We've missed you, Adam.
I love this series. I can't figure out how to explain why? But its relatable and real. And that's kinda beautiful
Yo Adam YouTube is screwing with you whenever I try to press the notification bell it says error occurred
The GOOD OLD INTRO üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
sky for the love of all that is good and beautiful turn on keepInventory or not... it's your gameplay lol
Stay strong man <3
So... so... nostalgic...
I am guessing this could be a new beginning,
Hey, you still friends with Sub?

I remember him
Sky, you cant spam click swords anymore. Wait until the sword symbol at the bottom of your crossbar is full and you'll hit at full strength.

Also, I'm glad you're on the right track. Take all the time you need to recover.
When I saw the intro I just paused the video. Looked up to the ceiling for like 30 seconds just thinking about all the nostalgia
Oml the intro gave me flashbacks
Im so glad you're back it brings me so much joy that you're trying to get yourself have on your feet<3 best of luck adam
I think I speak for everyone when I say modded cops and robbers, maybe another roleplay series (the older ones like Pirates of the Caribbean), and just basically more of your old stuff
Ha your not in my left ear, your in my heart üíõ
holy hell that intro was nostalgic
I used to play minecraft and watch you, now insted I watch you play minecraft and play Dark souls III, but I still play minecraft, I find it fun.
I realised something,

Adam's subscribed to t series.
Heya adam, honestly hope you feel better
Bruh I see you are subscribed to T-series. Why?
Don't spam click, it does more damage if you wait.
Sprinting underwater let‚Äôs you swim faster
Attack slower the dagger under cross hair needs to fill up for full damage and also hit groups of mobs
I'm so happy for you and glad you're back I wish the best for you man
Hey Adam, I don't know if this will reach you, but you made my early youth very pleasurable, when I was going through a situation similar to yours, I started working out, it really clears your mind, I hope this might help you. Thanks Sky.
Oh My Goodness He Back Boy
Yay my first like !! 

Wait why is it blue ?
Stay strong Adam. We love you so much and care about you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Just do the stuff that makes you happy and maybe try playing with your friends
The nostalgia üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trust me when I speak for all of us, when you record your the same person that we knew and loved. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling when I watched this video. It felt as if I was playing a game from when I was a kiddo. I felt nostalgia just by watching your videos and it‚Äôs great. Just don‚Äôt change and we‚Äôll all stick with you.

Sincerely, 
A member of the Sky Army
I MISSED YOU SOOO MUCH WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR BREAK SKY I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH YOU MAKE MY DAY WITH YOUR HUMOR!
This video found it's way to my sub box! Love you, Adam! Glad you've been looking to better yourself, man.

That intro will never get old. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Hey bro, we're here for you Sky, Stay strong. üí™
Ive been watching you for years and as someone that also struggles with mental health i really love this series. You seem really genuine and like you‚Äôre actually trying to get better and encourage other people to do the same. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope you do great things my dude :-)
The intro...aww man the nostalgia.
I watched all of your videos and don't worry about your depression we your fans will help you with your depression. üòÄüëç

UNITE TO HELP OUR GENERAL
"The legend returns part 2"
It's awesome because you've grown as a person and so has your previous audience. Coming back to this I feel super young and nostalgic. I'm so proud of who you're becoming. <3
Ayy the intro! I hope you get , not, depressed anymore..?
This gives so much nostalgia from when I was 12
Family: what are you wa- why are you crying?

Me: GO AWAY! IM BECOMING A CHILD AGAIN!!


(Ps: this video made my day! Thank you so much, Adamüíõ)
That jump from fighting the skeleton to just being in front of a tree is everything üòÇüòÇ
Damn! Its been years since I watched you I miss this honestly I remember my 9 year old self loving ur videos and you bringing so much happiness into my life ur a fuckin legend man much love‚ù§üíï
I remember when you posted this the first time, dk why it's a reupload but I still love and support you a lot Adam, my guy. üíú
when you haven‚Äôt played mc in years and you‚Äôre back to being a noob like adam ‚Äî also idk if any of you realize but he said in his intro he‚Äôs in treatment, idk if he is able to read our messages sky army :)
Omg I started crying... thank you.... 9 year old me is really happy üòä
2011-2014 is that you going inside me?!
We all love you sky and we got you back no matter what happens
we love sky
i guess

And damn im early
They also added gliding wings, hostile villagers w/ axes, wooden mansions, an end city, clay blocks, red sand and deserts,
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ the intro
Damn this is crazzzyyy.. missing the old days being young an 12 watching you guys play Minecraft w my boiü•∫
Barely half way through the video and is hitting in the feels.
4:47 dies to a skeleton
 "for me, I felt like I needed to start over"
 insert pun
I hope adam gets some of his old friends back or at least makes up with a few people.
Good luck here for it all man.
its so sad how he has 11mil subs and only 80k views
I'm gonna be honest. I'm happy he's handling more mature topics now. His audience grew up, and he can still be a hero and role model for them.
Omg the intro. Brings me back
You having the courage to admit this all makes me feel brave <3
Me= See's video is two days old
 Me again=YOUTUBE, what the frick, why didn't you tell me sooner!
idk some advice is the combat, when you use your sword to hit things you need to wait till that little bar near your courser fills up before it does max damage
Protip: Don't be afraid of those mobs, a good few hours with a stone/iron sword will knock back those baddies.
I love your content have you thought of doing Minecraft with mods
Do a modded survival games with ur friends.
Respect my guy. Respect. I just want you to know that you were pretty much my childhood and I like how you are bringing back minecraft. You have encouraged me to play again
Huge respect...
Huge respect...

THE CHILHOOD MEMORIES BUT IN 2019
Team crafted‚ù§‚ù§
sky,youve been playing with Jerome...but why not post about em? I love those vids owo
Not gonna lie, I almost cried. My boyfriend uses weed to try to cope with his depression, and I've used it in the past to try to cope with my stress and depression. 

It really isn't the answer. Please seek professional help if you can. I can tell all of you, it's heartbreaking to see someone close to you suffering, and relying on stuff like that just to feel normal. There's always a better alternative.
You guys have no idea how much I first off love that sky is back and second that he is opening up about his life and keeping us updated
hey Adam. Glad to see youre better after all these years. <3
Anybody else remember how he didn't pick up the pants in modded hunger games
You are god, please become yourself again, please no more sad boy, u become happy boy, best of luck
Damn last video I saw was the one of him saying he was coming back and before that it had been like years since I‚Äôve seen one of your videos sky keep on man we‚Äôre all with u much love ROCK N ROLL NEVER DIESü§üüèΩü§üüèΩ
If you look at lava and press Q. Something cool will happen. 




Jk don‚Äôt do that.
And he didn't know he could ride llamas if he had wool
I'm glad for you, Sky. There's more people than you realize that are out there for you.
And a few Minecraft tips: You can swim in water faster by basically "sprinting", like how'd you sprint on land (I think you press "w" twice, depending on your keyboard controls). And also, do not attack dolphins once you find them, it's just like when you attack a wolf or zombie pigman. There are also new hostile mobs: the Drowned and the Phantom. The Drowned are zombie-like creatures that live underwater in rivers, lakes or oceans, and some carry tridents that they can throw at you, so look out! The Phantom is the most terrifying hostile mob that is attracted to insomnia - meaning if you don't sleep through the nights, on the third night, they'll spawn high in the air, dive bomb you and attack. If you hit them or take cover, they stop their attack, but some come from behind. I have not seen this, but I heard they range in different sizes as well, and the biggest they can get is bigger than the Ender Dragon.
I hope this helps and good to hear you back!
We're here for you.
Try not to do things that might be bad for you
You were our childhood.
Funny thing is that I listened to this in my left ear the entire video #leftearstuff #skyarmy üíï
Welcome back sky,also ik you can do it..so stay strong
Just please stop spam clicking and let the crossbar fill to have more damage and if you sprint into the water you cam swim normaly
WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU SKY
YOU ARE JUST LIKE MY FRIEND THAT WAS HOMELESS AND DEPRESSED UNTIL RECENTLY HE GOT A NEW APARTMENT
Sky i dont know if youll get this but your my favorit youtuber and i have been watching your videos since you first started and your the strongest person i know
I‚Äôm glad you are getting better or at least getting there because ik how you feel, drugs aren‚Äôt a good way to cope or whatever has happened, the only thing you can do is move forward, i hope you upload more and update us on what‚Äôs happening, because everyone that watches this vid is there for you x3
...I've... TOTALLY already watched this video. Was this reuploaded?? Hes saying all the same things that I clearly remember him saying before. I remember watching this video. There's no way this wasn't  uploaded already because the things hes saying match what I heard before word for word. It all sounds the same. What happened? I'm confused. Someone HELP.   A :
Why is no one else mentioning it? I've watched to 5:39 and I've already seen this video for sure.  Reupload or what?
What happened to Sky Vs Gaming?
I was having a terrible f-ing day. Seeing that you posted cheered me up. I love you and this community üñ§ I hope everyone has a good day/night (wherever you guys are in the world)
Adam was always here for us
We will be always here for Adam
you were my idol as a younger kid and i think it‚Äôs safe to say that, for a nearly totally different reason now, you still ARE even today; keep on bettering yourself & doing the best that you can do üíïüíï!
I still have a  pin that he signed at the Duvall library years ago.
I miss ur vids so much I'm glad the sky army is back!!!!!... Please don't leave us again
Hey Adam can you release follow me. I love the song but you haven‚Äôt officially released it yet
Why adam...? LA lights cloud my eyes... days come and go.. LA dreams cloud my eyes... i'll just go with the flow ay
Long live the King......The budder King
The mic quality makes me feel very sad when he was like that back in the day.
Sky talking about his life and then: IS IT LLAMAS, WHEN DID THEY ADD THESE?

I don't know why but the stupid squid thing really got me. I was listening so intently and next thing I know I'm tearing up.I'm glad to see you back and happy you were honestly my childhood x
I love that he keeps referencing his New Years stream lol




sucribe tu adum
let's go find some butter;)
i‚Äôm so proud of you, i‚Äôm so proud to have grown up watching someone as self aware and smart as you. i found guided meditation and cleansing chakras extremely helpful personally and, like you said, talking to the people who care about me. you will get better. you have a strong, optimistic mindset. i believe in you and the universe has set out a beautiful path for you 
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Last sky video I saw was shrinkcraft








And he‚Äôs still the same
Adam your SkyArmy will all support you!
We all love you Adam‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
ive transported back to 2011 when i was still just a sophmore in high school....holy crap man
Sky, it's great to see you feeling at least a little better. in reference to advice on depression, here's the best change I made to deal with mine:
Take things slowly. society likes to pressure us to go fast, but sometimes it's really good to slow down a bit, stop and smell the roses. When ever you notice that you're feeling genuinely happy, savor it as much as possible. it makes it so much easier to remember those good moments if you try to commit them to memory intentionally. and when you can remember the good times, it's a bit easier to deal with the bad times. 

I hope it helps. good luck, friend.
I think we forgot to tell adam about the new combat system
Your doing great Adam im here cheering you onüòä
Hurray sky uploaded!
Hope you get better soon Sky
"Chicken roommate" oh my, the memories

Deep words. This video has lead me to believe that Sky has been through a lot. I'm glad that he's looking to forge a better path with his life. 
The people who really are important are the ones who have, and will, continue to support you throughout all of this. 

We wish you the best of luck moving forwards - SkyArmy
Man, it is amazing to see you back at Minecraft again! This is really bringing me back to my childhood when I would watch your mod reviews and your epic jump map vids. 


P.S. Also, Adam I am very proud that you are receiving help and that you are trying to become a better you. It's really cool to see you grow and learn from your past mistakes. I hope you get better dude.


~Just a recruit
This is the Adam that everyone remembers ‚ò∫
How do I start this? I guess like this. From one guy who has gotten through depression to another who is still suffering, don't be afraid to look for help from those around you. I almost learned that a little to late, I was an edgy teen when I had depression, but an edgy teen with practically no actual friends. I couldn't go to my family, big mistake, and the only real friend who noticed I was going through hard times I pushed away, yet he still kept coming back. 
It finally got too much, I couldn't take it. I slit my wrists. I was in the hospital for roughly a month, then forced into therapy for almost a year. I would have been in much longer if it weren't for my true friend staying by my side along with my family. Despite everything I had done to him, pushing him away, berating and belittling him, even physically assaulting him once, he always came back. I did try to self medicate by smoking cigarettes but that wasn't enough, and it ended several possibilities for me. My lungs were to weak to do anything sports related and I couldn't become a musician playing my flute. Self medication doesn't work Adam. Don't try it. 
Long story short, I almost lost my fight with depression, and it was only thanks to my family, my dearest, closest friend whom I still occasionally thank from time to time which is about two years later, and the therapy I went through. Adam, since you are getting the help you need, you are on the path to victory, I would say the next step is to reforge the bonds you lost, they will go a long way to helping you defeat your depression.
Can we get the old intro lmao...








For old times sake
What happened to jason? I miss mincraft universe
Good thing to see og‚Äôs are still playing
Adam we all love you
when you fight wait for the bar to restart
I have no idea why but seeing the old SDM intro for this spooked me
like I missed it so much??
I'm so glad this is back I remember watching all his stuff when I was only 9
I'm 17 this year and it's a huge relief to see someone I use to look up to come back and bring me the same amount of laughs <3
I'm honestly happy that him talking about depression and weed didn't demonitize the vid :)
He returns from the heavens to bring the ultimate power of nostalgia. Welcome back, Adam. You've changed so much, and you sound a lot different and quieter. More genuine, if I'm honest. I used to watch your vids when I was younger so I really hope your recovery is successful! Knowing that someone who indirectly affected me so much is well - or in the process of becoming well - is comforting.
Stay Strong Adam the Sky Army is here for you buddy and I AM most definitely here for you...
YES OLD INTRO
I just want to hear BUTTER again üò≠
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to watch people like Alex Jones and other people who show the negative outlook on the world while you are depressed because you begin to think like the character they have created. I‚Äôm not saying go watch videos of sunshine and rainbows but just keep in mind who you listen to influences how you think.

My childhood is comeing all back to me and all your music fucking slaps bro I hope you see this I love you man keep up with the good vibes
Seeing him coming back makes me cry in a good way. I love you and much respects and you‚Äôre very influential
That intro gives me nostalga
I started watching you when i was 5yo you were around a thousand or more subs im 13 now and im glad your back adam if you could try playing with MinecraftUniverse again please.
True best Minecraft YouTuber, and OG.
Feel better soon Adamdoescraftmine :)
"Sky does minecraft again"
Time your swipes so you do full damage. That little sword icon that fills up beneath the plus at the center of your screen shows you how full it is. Spamming your weapon makes it so far less damage
love you from the bottom of my heart Adam, always gonna support you. you were always there for me when I was young so I‚Äôll be here for you now
hold sword and fight 1 sec per click
Wait the butter master is back*^* OMG YESSSSS I MISSED YOU ADAM I HOPE YOUR DOING BETTER AND I HOPE YOUR HERE TO STAY, because your a real help to alot of people and alot of people care about you so dont give up and as a popular loading scream once said, "STAY DETERMINED"
I love this Sky. Hope you feel better! This made feel nastolgic and relaxed. Thanks!
Love you Adam keep doing what your doing
By the way.. We are all proud of you and please.. Keep going. For you and us.
We support you all the way bro!
IM SO HAPPY THAT YOU‚ÄôRE BACK AND THAT YOU‚ÄôRE GETTING HELP THAT YOU NEED. 
I‚Äôm mega proud of you. I might follow in your footsteps and finally get help for my own depression and mental health issue
I was watching one of max‚Äôs videos and i left to rewatch this one XD
Sky is subbed to t series
BUTTER YOU NEED BUTTER AND QUICK
13:45 Shaggy grants sky 10% of his power
I love you so much bro, stay strong
To do more damage wait for that bar under your crosshair to recharge after swinging
Music is a great way to cope with depression! That‚Äôs just from personal experience
If you lose your sword use an axe or a pickaxe, axes do more damage than swords
I clicked off of my friend‚Äôs live stream to see this
This is either real or i‚Äôve been smoking too much weed, eitherway this is beautiful.
OMG you're BACK!!!
I got my favorite boi back i love you no homo but your videos are awesome no matter how deep it gets üò¢
You should go back to older versions of minecraft an play them, it is possible through the launcher.
I love you soooooo much dude actually started crying when you started playing mincraft again
Hey, try adding shaders. I think it will be cool
Remember that you have to time attacks now, spamming just does the same damage as your fists
"I took my diet into a new level. I just ate weed", is what I expected Adam to say.
That intro brings back so many memories.
You are te first youtuber i ever watched and your still in my heart and im praying for you man
sky i love you and we all love you man and get well soon. love   the hunter
I can't relate to ur depression but my boyfriend can probably relate to it but he told me that before he met me, he was really depressed and he told me that i made it better just by being there for him.

Btw I've been watching u for a long time so I hope u are feeling better
glad to see your back but now your the recruit
ADAM I LOVE YOU! (Not in a creepy way, in a supportive fan way :P) and the old intro makes me so happy. I hope you get the treatment you need, and get well soon!
Adam pls bring back sky vs gaming that was my favorite
Adam I know your depressed and I hope you get better but if it gets to bad for you
Just remember
SQUIDS AND BUTTTER!
It‚Äôs good to have you back man hopefully you can beat your depression
Same man I have depression but I'm scared to really tell anyone about it
just some advise wait in between attacks to do full damage
I know the feeling. You can get through it. I did, it is possible.
I hope you feel great soon!

Also I don't know if you ever learned about the new combat system. You can't spam click anymore. You have to wait until the bar fills up to hit again to actually do some damage
You know what in school I realized it takes 20 good things to fix a bad mistake
Adam it makes me want to cry that your doing Minecraft again you make me super happy! üôÇ
I feel like sky is high during this lmaoo
Between him being real and just being joking still makes me laugh
more pls, this brings back, too many good childhood memories
Hope you get better!

I love you Adam ! I hope you can get better like I did
Sky ur loved globally and u should know that most of us has stuck with through thicc and thin just know that ur wanted and loved have a wonderful day
This is so nostalgic for me these videos youve been putting out and if you feel down or like things arent getting better i want you to remember this, through your videos and a chain of events i ended up meeting one of my bestest friends in the whole world, and i really thank you for that Adam. 

On a separate note, im also in treatment, so I know what its like to confront said demons and its good to see your trying to get better one step at a time with these videos. I wish you the best of luck
If you wait for the sword icon below your crosshair to fill, the sword will do the correct amount of damage. If not, it‚Äôll be extremely weakened
WE LOVE SKY‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
WE LOVE YOU SKY.!!!!
The intro brought back my childhood...god I feel so old
Old Intro gonna make me cry
You were my very first favourite youtuber, and now one of my idols. I've always loved your minecraft videos and I love your music too. I'm going through so much right now and you may not know it but you help quite a bit. Thanks Adam, you're awesome <3
No matter how much I grow, or how much I age, I will never grow bored of Adam. He‚Äôs been the one person who always made me laugh as a kid, and he was what made up my childhood üíñüíñ
It's back it's back he's back yay hooray old intro
Life has its ups and downs, if you think your at the highest you've been its probably because you have boosters below you helping you
Eleven year old me would like to say - thank you. <3
But genuinely, I would like you to know you aren't alone. I currently am struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and actions, and I understand how difficult it can be. My boyfriend dumped me after I got an abortion, and keep in mind that this was only a few months after my brother killed himself. I'm also struggling with anorexia, and seeing you put in effort to work towards the future has really inspired me.
Thank you.
man LA lights and Broken rings are some of the best songs I know
look at the sword below the Cross whenever you hit something. you will see that when you attack, it has a "cooldown" that if you don't respect, you don't deal much damage. if you spam it you'll basically do half a heart or a heart of damage.
also, is this a reupload ? (but with squid added ?)
I hope the treatment goes well. We're all here to support you bro.
(; he‚Äôs back.......it‚Äôs so beautiful
Why‚Äôd he reupload this with a new thumbnail
I love to see you back will you do hytale content
Wait a minute... was that Lumberjack Sky? Omg he's back guys
I remember watching sky WAY back in the day when I was a kid. And I started to watch his OLD videos and I'm glad he was a part of my life, I take my hat off for you sky. Truly thank you.
God bless you. You are a good man you dont deserve this
And by the way you need to attack a littil bit slower in this version to do more damage. 
And you can use a command called keep inventory so you dont lose your items when you die
And if you sprint under water you will start swimming

yo i just wanna say you've become such a big inspiration to me
seeing you go through so much and just keep pushing on despite everything and despite there being no assurance that everything's gonna come out ok and now watching you in this new series realizing that throughout most of your content you were being real with us and just acting how you wanted to act and you were actually just being you the whole time instead of this fake persona i thought you were putting on in the last few years has made my conntection with your content from my childhood grow even stronger.
I've watched you since I was 8 atleast and now seeing you be able to go through all that and still maintain that smile and laugh i see in your videos and the vlogs your gf has been posting it has just really inspired me and made me so happy. 
I hope everything turns out ok in the end for you, and it seems right now, everything will. Keep pushin through and being strong.

Tyler Pappas is a great guy. I'm glad he helped you. I liked his videos.




(Logdotzip)
lol I am so glad you are back
WE LOVE SKY!!
Adam, you legit are making me sob. I used to be such a huge fan and my favorite videos were of you and deadlox. Hearing you having these troubles (that many people experience, youre not alone) trying to work to better yourself is something i didnt expect. Once you apologized to the other friends you used to 0ay with, tears actually streamed down my face.
Adam don't continually swing your sword space out your clicks just check some old update videos
Spamming sword is bad
Waiting for the tiny sword under your crosshair to go away is good
MY CHILDHOOD. HE EVEN HAS THE INTRO!
Hockey is fun therapy you should try it or play nhl19
Watching Sky's videos was my childhood... I'm sorry to hear life has been rough but I'm glad you're on the road to recovery, we may not know you in person but we're all here for you Bud. You were and still are an inspiration to me and to countless other people, chin up Budder Warrior >-<
Thanks for this, just don't burn out
O M G THE OLD INTRO
1:10 JUST PLAY MINECRAFT


Or animate you saying that
can you please start do not laugh again QWQ
Adam, i'm sorry that you had to go through so much, but seeing you find the positive in your situation really shows how much you've improved as a person, and i'm glad you took that step in your life. I'm so happy you're feeling better, and I hope you find the light in your life that  you're looking for.
If you sprint underwater you will swim very fast

I have been waiting ages to see that intro again
1.9 Combat update will rig it
The intro pog
I actually cried when I saw this
Please continue the purge series when you've gotten better
Weapons have a recharge so spamming the attack button isn't as smart anymore. There is a recharge bar by the crosshair after you attack.
I like this type of sky, he‚Äôs humble and open minded.
Back to the good o' days
Talk to your family if they don't know, I did that and it got a lot off my chest
The great Budder Hero is back
Are you and Ross,Max,Red.and Barney still friends
Oh my frick the man is back
First and hey bro keep going
Older Minecraft intro lets go whooo hoo nastalga
Hey Adam nice to see you are back with the og stuff
The best advice I can give is to make amends- the more personal the better, if they dont forgive you atleast you were able to get it off your chest
I miss that opening so much
Firstly Adam, when attacking mob's you have to swing slowly, you see the little sword icon above the cross-hairs, that show's how much damage you do so take it slowly, Second you NEED to sleep soon, if you don't sleep for 3 day's straight a mob called the phantom will be spawned in the sky and constantly attack you until you fall asleep, Thirdly stay clear of water's, there's a new zombie called the drowned that can attack you and it can sometimes hold a trident, there are some new friendly mob's, and some bad one's, also axes do more damage than sword's but they take longer to reload an attack, that's about it for now hope you take these set of advice's well, and good luck!
mistakes happen. but you're a good person and still loved, no matter what. We are still here for you.
I feel ur depression I has it too but I am afraid to get help
im so proud of you for being honest with yourself and getting the help you need
Damn this is deep. I love this man.
I'm at frickin 3 percent and still plan to watch everythingggggggg
You have bear fists??
Ah The Golden Dayz.
Meh God it's been for ever since I have watched one of you videos. Good to see you back
I missed you Adam so much!

Jokes aside, I feel you on an personal level. Depression is hard. It's fantastic that you have the drive to make yourself better! ‚úåüòÑ
Know you‚Äôve been posting for like a bit now but this is probably the best video to put it on. 

Well, welcome back to everything else that isn‚Äôt money related (ish). Everyone here is here to support and even with all your mistakes, we all forgive you. Just take everything easy, it‚Äôs been rough and now that you (not the drugs) are back we can all be happy (though your humor seems to be still there underneath that tired tone)

If you sprint under water you can swim. Like legit swim
Sad stories and Minecraft shouldn‚Äôt mix together so well
I think it's great that you're getting treatment, and I think it's great that you're doing this series. I was diagnosed with moderate depression and it's hard. I've thankfully met a small group of people who accept me and bring out the best in me as well as tell me when I'm being a prick. I also got a dog who is the light of my life. I'm looking into getting a medical marijuana card since I also suffer from anxiety and don't want to take any more medication. 


I love that you're being more open about your problems. I love that I have someone I can relate to. It's a lot easier knowing you're not alone.
I don‚Äôt know how you did it but your making me laugh cry at the same time also listen to so some Coldplay vi va lada
We love you Sky/ Adam
I can always understand when someone fails days they start to miss the good old days because it's happened to me before and it's a feels good memory and you realize were it went wrong and you wish you could go back and fix it

Sky no matter what happens we will always be here for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Man this is a reupload and I still watched it all
instant nostalgia with the intro
cbd oils/ edibles and stuff could help. just slight mood boost. but not too much cause u don‚Äôt wanna be dependent on them
This was actually really cool.... Really chill. Some real talk and chill just watching idle wandering
DO A MODDED SURVIVAL CRAFT
Ok so here are some things you should know:

1. Combat Update- update in which you have to wait for the tiny sword icon where your marker usually is to fully recharge for a full power strike
2. You need 3 wool of the same color to make a bed
3. Drowners- underwater zombies that may come up on land. Have a chance of spawning a trident, a javelin type weapon that you have a chance of getting if it ever does spawn.
4.sprint in water to to a breaststroke, you move faster and can fit in 1 block holes.
5.if you ever do find an ocean, break the long stalks to get kelp, if smelted it‚Äôs a really cheap thing to get and it‚Äôs easy to obtain a lot of it at once.
6. You‚Äôre a hero and I hope you can get all the help you need.
I love Adam so muchüòÇüò≠
sky, I really hope this series helps you

WHO LIKE MINECRAF?
That intro. So nostalgic
gotta love youtube. NO views 20 likes
Wait for the bar to fill up all the way when attacking, it does the most damage when it‚Äôs filled
I never thought I would be learning life lessons from someone who made my childhood
OMG HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THAT ADAM IS BACK PLAYING MINECRAFT
even if you are aways down. the sky army will be with you always
Wasn't  this made a couple weeks back? It's still good anyways. But I'm curious. Was it?
hi sky <3 4:46 heh you uh you okay there? All your items are gone xD I loved that transition. I use a pen to get high, it's helpful temporarily but I think setting new realistic goals for yourself and keeping in touch with friends is the best solution I've had so far in college when dealing with loneliness and stress. All humans have anxiety, some can get depressed. Loved seeing your gameplay along with some genuine commentary :)
30views and 52 likes YouTube what are you on
Just to let you know, you've  inspired  me when younger I loved your videos AND I STILL DO! You taught me how to play mine craft, you made me a better person, you made me smile so many times. I love you so much you don't  understand. WE ALL LOVE YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU A LOT OF SUPPORT.‚ô°
this video is so important especially today
THE SQUIDS ARE BACK YAY (never thought I would say that)
old intro and name oh boy !
One year later he'll be a Millionaire again and quitüòÇüòÇlove you bro jk
When you hit the animals or mobs wait for the little bar that's in the middle of your screen to load and then you can hit again
Serious 
Llamas
Serios
I have been subscribed for a long time and i was wondering where did the old crew go
i respect you brother
I love how half of the comments on this emotionally taxing video are people updating sky on the new Minecraft versions he missed out on. That is the definition of gamers unite. I love this too much for words.
Btw they added crossbows, swimming animations, shipwrecks, mansions, and new mobs.
You missed out on a lot man
#leftearstuff
I love your music especially the ksi diss tracks
Awesome as always. Also sky you had a RP I believe it was based off of lost the show however i cant seem to find it, any tips or key search words? (That got too formal too fast ;-;) IGuessYouCanAlsoLinkThePlaylistAsWellButIMeanWhateveah
Remember when he was supposed to do a disstrack on somone. Yeah that never happened
Sprint while swimming to swim very fast
#PASTRAMI CITY
I just saw Sky is subbed to T-Series





Except its all good he can support anyone
Hey guys, I‚Äôm either second or all the comments haven‚Äôt loaded in.
Iv been subscribed ever since i was 7
WE LOVE SKY
At 4:52 when he said I wanted to start over 
Literally start over..
Wait...  weed does this to people?

DrUgS aRE bAd EmKAy
damn... I feel really bad for you my dude... loosing everyone you cared about... being depressed... I hate to see people go through that. I hope you get better.
I missed this and that intro sm
Past Present and Future...    
i think i heard that line before...
I can see depression, right now, I had my parents divorce like two months ago and I was really sad. 
I started having mental breakdowns and felt like I wanted to do suicide.
Most of the time it was like social problems like back in ymca, I said something because I was frustrated and said that an adult supervisor was a freaking liar but he thought I said the f word.
Now at that point, I tried telling them the truth but they just lifted their heads and were convinced that I said the curse word.
But then when I told my therapist, she said to maybe forgive. And that made a new perspective and I personally forgiven for them accusing me of doing that. I hope whatever you have right now can be helped personally and with advice.
When the music career didn‚Äôt work out.
My heart it is restored I‚Äôve  miss this
you should play pixelmon reforged or generations
Well now they have panda now in the bamboo forest biome
Idk how old I was when I watched him but I loved him for what he did and when he quit I was sad.When he came back I was the happiest I have ever been.üòä
This what I need to get the energy to get out of bed
You should play with shaders
I'm so glad he's back
Sky i dare you to not sleep in minecraft for 3 days in minecraft 

Btw sky Sprint in water to swim
Wait, is the king truly back?
WE LOVE SKY‚ô•
Happy to now you're still here with us
make prison escape videos again lol
You should play Minecraft Story Mode!
What happend to your house labs and everything
Listening to you, one of my many childhood role models, talk about stuff you were going through behind the scenes that I had no clue about is a real eye opener and has brought me to love and respect you even more that I did back then. Knowing that the guy who'd always bring me laughs after long school days without fail is working hard to pull through not just for us but also himself. Listening to this video has made me think over how I've been dealing with myself and before I turn this comment into a wall of text... I want to thank you for everything Adam, I am proud to be a part of the Sky Army and I always will be
 -Sincerely from me, one of your many fans, Marcus
I think one of the great things about you coming back to this is that those of us who have followed you for a long time kind of grew up with you and can relate to things you have gone through and are going though and some of us may not have a good support system in RL but when people like you speak up about personal struggles at least we know we're not really going through it alone.
Even mobs went easy mode even though he set it on Normal...
Adam is thicc
Combat system buddy
Adam keep on going don't give up  keep on going with your videos
This reminds me of the good old days
I really enjoyed this. Not the fact that you got nothing done but the fact that you opened up and told us your story.
thank you so much for coming back because I've been going though a lot lately and thank you for talking about your life I feel like my 12 year old feel again and it is really helping me I missed you thank you Sky
It's all good Adam, I've watched your videos from the beginning and I've enjoyed them all every step of the way. So happy for you that you're getting the help you need. From a faithful member of the sky army, I'm glad you're coming back to YouTube and to health.

Sky gets deep [ep 1]
Hang in their duder
Is this a reupload cause i think ive seen this
Howd you know it was my left ear
sky u have helped me a lot
How the hell did you know my right earbud is broken?
Amids all these emotional comments i thought i would just add that nowadays attacks have a cool down. You need to wait for that bar by your crosshair to fill up before you swing in order to do maximum damage.
man he hasn't even met a phantom yet
man i know were your coming from im going through depression just hang in there im glad your coming back SKY i loved your vids. come back to us all im gonna be here and welcome back lets all get better as a hole
Im here for you adam :D even though i cant text you or anything. Ill be watching ur vids and likeing every one of them üíõüòÅüíõ
We're glad to have you back Adam. We all came back so if your friends really care, they'll come back too. You've just got to give it time. I hope you get better, I really do. So good luck to you, the Sky Army stands beside you <3
the intro hit me like a brick wall
BUTTER... üòç
LOL OMG THAT INTRO YOOOOOOOOOOO
you should do more film music , that was great stuff
Man, you‚Äôre probably the most human and kind YouTuber I have ever watched. I hope you get better!

It‚Äôs gonna tick me off if I don‚Äôt state this, they added Shields, Tridents, and an Attack Cooldown. You have to wait for the Cooldown to be over to deal max Damage. You can also swim by sprinting underwater
Aw man, I can't help but admire how open Adam is in this video. I'm glad to see him back, and I hope he gets to a place where he's happy with himself again.
I liked before the video even buffering
Sky why dont u do a server where u are going survival with lots of us
Hey will you change the name back? Regardless, sky i love you man when i was 8 i watched you for the first time you showed me there was still hope in the world and stopped from almost offing myself. Thank you. You do you man
im a big supporter of pot but i dont really think that it should be used for depression unless your doc tells you, casually though i love it lol
Is it just me or i feel like i all ready watched this video like 3 weeks or 4 weeks ago....
We are here for you man
Did I just time travelled?!
Try to get in touch with old friends and apologize directly it will make you feel better

This video was posted like 2 weeks ago
What happened to Kermit and your other buddies? I loved the videos!
In the next episode can you just talk about what the other og minecrafters are like the ones from 2012. When you talked about Kermit it got me thinking
üî•üî•üî•üî•
My god... the squid hatred has been reborn our god is back
4:37 the watcher on the wall returns
We have been here for ya Adam, even when you didn't post. Ur life is still going and you still time fix yourself. Live life the greatest bc from what I can tell, we are all enjoying you. There is also time to make new friends and maybe even get your old ones back. Personally, I'm really happy ur back, but if you still need a break a try to be the best u can be, do it. So all I can ask is take care of yourself, and still think about ur own health a joy before ours. üôÇ
Pffff what a weeb doesn‚Äôt even know about the 1.8+ combat
throws phone at wall in excitement
With you back in the drivers seat, we as an army can do anything. We‚Äôre here for you, most of us never left. Hopefully we can reunite some of those old relationships. It feels good to have you back and playing Minecraft again!
This is what happen after ksi disses nednobody or adam...smh
press ctrl to swim underwater, there's an animation for it (just like if you were to sprint on land)
as feeling depression wise you and i went through the same thing and as a person who just went through depression im happy that i can relate to you Adam
...my nostalgia is just....so sad and happy
Can u do mods
Hi yaaaaaay you back
The memories are flooding back
We‚Äôre glad your back
Dude I‚Äôve been going through your old videos I would watch at like 9 years old and they give me some good memories and I hope you start to do them again!! I‚Äôll keep you in my prayers Adam and I hope things will only go up from here!!
YES HE'S BACK
Sky you had great friends I think they all will come back around at some point. I have lost friends because I didnt want to do drugs with them. Hang in there man you are doing great things.
Weed is enjoyable and can treat certain pains but it cannot eliminate the symptoms and severity of depression (at least not frequently.) Its good as a recreational kind of thing and the cbd is good for physical pain but depression and anxiety if severe enough needs treatment, whether or not meds are involved.

For me if I only smoked weed instead of getting treatment when I did I feel like I would be a much more depressed and angry bitter person. I needed the med Ive taken to level out my dopamine and my friends to help pull me out of that dark point.

But yeah weed definitely can put to ease my anxiety and help me physically relax when I partake.
Adam  your not alone

My dad died and I‚Äôm 13. I still push past it like you should
"And if it doesn't....uh...blulululululu"

I shed a tear as soon as that OG intro started
I‚Äôm so friggen happy he‚Äôs back to the old intro too
Gameplay tips
Don't spam the sword, it drains it, and you can charge your attack to hit multiple targets, like with the sheep.
Sprint underwater to actually swim, not the minecraft bobbing up and down swim.
If you get into a large cave system, allways place torches on one set side so you can find the way back.
Jump and wait for the downward momentum to come and punch to deal more damage.
There's no shame in retreating from battle.


If I missed anything, let me know
Sky is the reason why I played minecraft again.
Do modded
If you guys don't start Guildcraft again, I'm gonna be poopy in pants
I think there is a spawner below your house
Hasnt sky already uploaded this
i love you so much ive watched you since i was literally like 9 ur new videos are giving me crazy nostalgia. I LOVE U SM LIKE KSBKWESVNAJRVHFSKDJ I wish i could smoke a fat doobie w you <3 and i hope you get through any rough patches that life decides to fucking chuck at you. i love you bro like im so high rn i just need to spread love rn so hi i lov e you
I know you probably won‚Äôt see this but I‚Äôve been watching for so long on so many different channels and it was the best part of my day coming home from school and hoping on the computer and just Watching your videos because I was in a depressed state of my life from a young age and your videos always made me happy and I‚Äôve seen your first video to your last and I‚Äôm only 14
I mean, if you want to feel better, don't bottle your emotions up. I would know, because it caused a lot of random breakdowns over nothing. I would also suggest being more open with those around you, it can help a lot. I would also suggest like getting an animal, it allows you to take care of something, and they can provide as much love as you can too! I'm not really a professional, so I don't really know if this could help you, but if it does, that makes me happy :D


On other topics, you were a real role modle for me when I was younger. Surprisingly, you were a look into the real world for me, seeing how you talked about your eating problems in one of your old videos was an eye opener. And I really hope you get better, you deserve true happiness my dude.
Sky I have depression too
THE INTRO
You are my hero
12:10 omfg he referenced the first series. The chicken roommate. He remembers. Omfg yes.
Wait you reposted the same vid Adam lol didn't realize till da yamas
You even have the old intro.
Listen to Marina's song True! It's a positive song to help fight depression
Yayyyy squid is back!!!
llamas!!
This is sooo much nostalgia!
I‚Äôm just glad your back and I hope you get better.üòâ
No way wow um damn
Dont spam attack, wait for the little sword in the bottom to charge up and you will do more damage
I really hope this series will be apart of his treatment
I'm a user of marijuana and sometimes its just.. Not meant for some people
please release more music
Yes!  YES YES YES YES YES YES YES USE YES YEA DUCKING YES!
Yea so here's a few immediate updates you missed!!!

Water has totally been updated, sunken ships got tons of loot and treasure maps can lead to generated structures, you can also sprint in water to swim. Water interacts with half blocks such as fences and slabs and boats are really good now too.

The Nether and Redstone are exactly the same minus the additional to one new block to each. Commands have been a bit reworked though.

New skeleton and zombie variants spawn specifically in ice, desert and ocean biomes. Also, if you don't sleep for 5 days and aren't covered by blocks, flying mobs will  attack you at night.

New stones have also been added too, though they're entirely useless and noticeable.

Among other animals, Rabbits and Llamas have been added, and sheep drop mutton now.

Combat has been completely changed too! when you hover over an attackable mob, a small hud in the shape of a sword will appear over the crosshair. When it's full, swords will do bonus + AoE damage, and Axes will do bonus damage. Axes do the most single target damage now and can easily break shields, however, swords still are the best generalist weapon. 
Connecting to that last point,  shields are super strong too, so you'll probably want one really soon. You can equip items to your off-hand by pressing F or by bringing up your inventory, so most people put their shields in there.

Tons of new decorative blocks have been added, glazed terracotta and variants of stained clay are craftable among a built in crafting book that's functionally NotEnoughItems. Also you'll love this, you can strip wood logs for a barkless version of each log, plus customizable banners have been added too. (Everything I mentioned looks really nice. Building has never been easier.)

That's everything major that you may need to encounter, The End has been received a massive face-lift, but you won't get there soon.

I'm really excited to watch this playthrough Adam. Seeing you much more grounded really feels organic and makes the connection between the viewer feel really personal, and I'm absolutely loving it!!! 
Pierce the heavens dude, kick logic to the curb and do the impossible! Just believe in the us who believe in you!


(Original by Doofus on the last video)
Love you man
WE LOVE SKY
I remember when you would play those parkour maps with deadlox and freak out and it felt honest and fun. For a while it seemed forced, overdone and unreal but it feels like I'm back again, watching those old videos of this random YouTube account I just happend to find one day. It feels real again, like you. Thank you.
Damn, shits making me feel young again, I used to watch you all the time when I was little and seeing you back and running again is awesome. Good luck with the treatment and we all love you
We have to grow up sometime guysüòî
adam pls play with mods
I was crying üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Yikes. This brings back my 6th grade days, watching Sky before I went to school to somewhat help me deal with the hardships. Your videos helped me get better, Sky. Wish I could do something to return the favor for all you have helped me through coming up
That intro hit me right in the nostalgia
#left ear stuff
is this real ?!
Hey man just saying your spamming attack it don't work like that no more a little sword bar appears below ur cursor if I don't wait for it to fill between attacks you will do some poor damage
Oh my god, hes back
YEEEEEEEEET
trows genicos
everywhere
My ex used to use weed for his issues but so much so it made it to where anything he said made me not be able to take him seriously as he said "dont take anything i say seeiously from that time. I was using weed"  Sky you made a lot of our childhoods. You deserve to be happy.
I hope you find something that worksfor you
to swim you sprint underwater
I am glad hes back. I grew up watching him.
Golden Butter
Your the best Adam hope you get better.
Press control when you're underwater
WE LOVE SKY!
I'm freaked out because when he said "it's me in your left ear again" I only had one ear bud in. In my left ear.
WE LOVE SKY
should we all point out to adam that combat has a cool down XDDD
WE LOVE SKY
ur the reason i started playing minecraft again
Omg you came back
Sprint bro
You have to pace your swings with the sword to hit as hard as possible. :)
Adam when u made minecraft video,s before I was in a lot of carp and will I was I watched u and you made happy and now I am not sad anymore so thank u for making me part of the sky army
Sky in order for you to move faster underwater you need to hold w and press ctrl key
Hey sky glad to know your getting back on your feet and doung better for yourself and fans who will always support you and if you don't mind this little maybe really really personal question what happened to DJ baby mason and alissa? (hope i said her name right)
Wait till sky finds dolphins added to the game, or even coral reefs, he's gonna be in heaven
Hey, I want you to know that youre not alone. Im currently in treatment also. And i understand how it feels to lose things and let go of things. I used to be the top musician in my school, worked on theatre, and wrestled. But depression got me, and now i do none of those things. Of course i miss all of it, but i knew i wouldnt get better if i worked alone. Sometimes you need to remind yourself that its okay to reach out for help
I just realised that Adam are subscribed to t series üòë
Bring back skga.me
Omg I just kept getting flash backs of being in middle school watching his videos on my iPod touch in the middle of the night.
WE LOVE YOU SKY
That intro gives me memories
I can feel IT am coming back tro
Thanks for sharing all this with us Adam. It really makes me happy you're getting the help needed, and that you are even shinning some light on past problems. Keep doing what your doing! Just know you still have a loyal fan base who is always here to support you, and is happy to listen to whatever you need to get off your chest. Just remember we are all humans, making mistakes big and small. It doesn't matter how big, or how long you've been making them, what matters is that you realize is and better yourself.


 P.S. Combat got updated a while ago. When you use a tool/weapon to attack, you will see a sword icon show up above your hotbar. If you hit with the tool/weapon before the icon fills up you do very little damage. You basically can't spam weapons anymore (yes, everyone hates it).
Attack slower
This is just so nice seeing him playing this again.
YE you go grill
WE LOVE SKY
You need to work on that house
fall, my tears
Adam you grew so much as a person, I rember watching you as a kids and you were more childish, or well joking, but now I feel like your still a funny person. But at the same time your more serious, and more able to admit to your mistakes, and I think youtube should have more people like that, because everyone on this platform hides in a way. They all pretend their happy and everything is fine, but it isnt.

But I truely wish you luck with all of this, and I hope you get better <3
Honey call your friends tell them what you told us in this video 
Even if they don‚Äôt take you back at least you‚Äôll do your part and feel better about yourself
You gotta time your swings btw it‚Äôs the worst update
Anybody else was here since mod reviews?
its like the old videos of minecraft the mic and how he plays not the other stuff

Guys... this feels like a suicide note... idk...
Take all the time you need man, we are your fans, we‚Äôve been your fans since the early days we can wait till you are 100%
MY CHILDHOOD TY
hold ctrl to sprint
tbh I‚Äôve been in the same state of mind and always tried to cope with it alone. But one day I had to breakdown and talk to someone. it‚Äôs the worse to be in that state of mind because all you can do is stay there until you find yourself again.
HOW TF COULD I FORGET ABOUT KERMIT OMFG
We make mistakes  that's what makes us human Adam. Here since  2012
s m o k I n  l o t  o f  p o t
When swinging your sword, you get more damage dealt when the bar in the middle is completely white.
GIVE ME MY GODDAMN SON HEUEHEUEHEUEER
Why are you subbed to T-Gay
Sky I used to watch you 4 years ago and I was supper sad when you quit youtube. I‚Äôm so happy you decided to start again, I hope you‚Äôre feeling okay now. Know we support you and if you are feeling sad don‚Äôt feel worried of speaking out about it! It helps a whole lot more than keeping it in, I know from experience. Watching your videos helped me a lot in my darkest moments which aren‚Äôt over yet as I‚Äôm not even an adult yet. Well take care of yourself mentally and physically. :) Stay awesome Sky.
Make a bed. There are new mobs that attack when 3 nights without sleep pass.
Hey sky use old mics like before
I recommend crafting a book and quill because there‚Äôs different monuments now like a woodland mansion and ocean monuments or normal stuff like villages or sunken ships. Also I‚Äôve been watching you slain some mobs and swimming in water,double tap W to swim faster in water and wait out your sword timing in order to make a sword spin which deals heavier damage to mobs.
HIT SLOWER TO DO MORE DAMAGE PLEASE
end 2012 beginning 2013 when I found out about sky and Chimneyswift 9 year old me returns.
You‚Äôre so badass dude
Sky, you really made my childhood and honestly when I first saw you uploading minecraft again I came pretty close to screaming. I really missed you man, a lot of people did. Anyway, you've made my childhood so much better. You played a pretty huge role in shaping who I am today and that means a crap ton!! I don't know if this comment would make you like anxious but you really mean the world to me, you helped me make friends and be more open! I'm so happy you're back since you've always been someone that's motivated, inspires, and grew me (that sounds weird) to who I am today. Thank you Sky!
WE LOVE SKY
Oh and sky if you go into f5 and try to sprint in water there is a new animation
We're all here for you, Adam.

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting treatment. Hope you get better
Sometimes it takes someone to hit rock bottom to build them selves back up the way they want to and the way they want others to see them and to better them selves skye, I‚Äôm in the same situation bro and I am glad there‚Äôs others like me like you and it helps me even more to build my self back up. Skye I‚Äôve been here since day 1 and will continue to be here. You have helped me in the right way skye thank you and I hope to one day meet you and just talk and talk and talk and have deep conversations with you skye. Thank you for doing this.
This might just help me with some personal problems sky... Thank you
WE LOVE SKYYYYYYYYY
Am I the only one who remembers already watching this video like 3 weeks ago and then him reuploading it today?
We support you sky
12:55 ‚Äúoh baby a triple!‚Äù
We miss you sky‚ù§Ô∏è
HES BACK BOYS
Thank you Adam very cool. ( were all here for you)
Hey sky, I know you probably won't see this, but if you do, then first of all, just know that everyone loves you and if you're ever feeling especially down, we're here for you. Second, heres some info on the new stuff in Minecraft. 
Yes, they added Llamas
If you Sprint underwater you swim way faster
When you're attacking there's that little sword thing, when it's full it does more damage and with a sword it does a swipe thing
Axe's generally do more damage than swords but are slower
There's new zombies but they stay underwater, and when you swim in the same water as them they usually attack you
Villages now spawn a ton of cats with them
There are tridents you can get, but you can't craft them
There's a bunch of new underwater stuff, like shipwrecks that spawn with treasures in them, you can get treasure maps, there's Coral, underwater runs that aren't the underwater temples with guardians, dolphins that if you feed them a fish they will lead you to an underwater thing, you can catch fish in a bucket, and a ton of other stuff, too much to mention. Sorry this was so long if you did see it
if you have a full hunger bar your heal
Butter milk
6:19 squid!
I feel like I have watched this video
there were so many unintentional puns
I'm sorry you've gone through all of that, I'm sure that you might live a better life and your friends would come back and play with you
the old intro killed me and i love that.  i hate that youtube hid this from me.
Man im so glad he's back I still remember when I got taken from my parents and I could only use my phone one hour a day I would spend that hour watching Adams videos so happy to see him doing this again
Is this new or ancient?
Yeeey your upload:)
Adam don‚Äôt worry bro you‚Äôll find urself someday and you‚Äôll have people to support you along the way <3 all but love man
Friends can cure your depression.
THE NOSTALGIA
The llamas were added after you left.

it's hard to believe i'm almost thirteen, sky, and you coming back to minecraft brings my soul joy. the true fight within you after you released all of that pent of anger you stored each and everyday. it's really hard to think hen you're twelve, five years ago your favorite youtuber releases a song and when the time struck you stopped playing this game that brought nostalgia. the feeling to rewatch your videos is a miracle that youtube has brought to us. you are a 
I MISSED U SO MUCH ADAMüò≠üò≠üò≠, I had stopped watching YouTube for like a year straight, absolutely no YouTube at all, I came back and he left, that was the saddest thing ever, but I‚Äôm so happy ur back u were my childhoodüò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
420 friendly ehhh
I miss you and I'm sorry you had to go through that
If you can pls re attempt island of the skies
#skylox
Your in my right ear
I have depression too.
why am i crying
We Love Sky ‚ù§Ô∏è
The intro... the nostalgia.
I haven‚Äôt hear the squid voice in years
Anyone else feel like they accidentally resent the episode 1v
We need to send this video to everyone who Adam has ever played with and to every former sky army recruit that you know. Show them all that even at his deepest points, he still remembers all those who have ever been by his side and supported him, even all the old recruits, because right now he needs all the support we can give him. 

Idk it really touched me when he brought up Seto and Jason, I feel like if they saw him now, that maybe things could be become better between all the old gang. Maybe even build things back up with BajanCanadian and the rest of the old tc crew
Cops And Robberq
i‚Äôm so proud of you adam
OMG MY INNER SELF GEKKING OUT. Sky I‚Äôm getting to much nostalgia love the vids keep it up I love seeing this Mabey try cops and robbers
You see that sword thing filling up? When its full hit again, it'll deal more damage and sometimes do a multi hit, and sprinting underwater makes you swim faster, also there is a mob called the phantom that spawns if you don't sleep in a bed. P.S Get butter soon, and yes that was a pun, don't PUNish me, you don't PUNderstand!
do stuff w/ jerome
4:48 he ded
Also Sky I recommend running long runs in parks or just in general. I went through some depression back in 8th grade and I remember my friend requesting I run with him with the high school and let me tell you this. Best decision I have made with coping with Depression. I still have some depression but not as much and everyday I‚Äôm striving to find that most perfect me. Run with friends too. It‚Äôs better that way. Also if you are going to run I recommend looking for some local 5k‚Äôs in your area (3.1 miles). It‚Äôs not really competition against others rather against yourself. 


As fans we hope you become better so we can relive our childhoods/experience something new with someone (Sky) new!
It‚Äôs so nice to hear someone talk about real topics. There is only one other person I‚Äôm subbed to who actually talks about the real hardcore things and its just awesome to hear someone else start being real with what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm glad your getting somewhere better in life and I‚Äôll support you till the end. 
Also I would give you advice on how to get better on Minecraft...but it‚Äôs been a long while since Ive even touched my computer with MC loaded on it XP
we will always be here to support you
This was so damn nostalgic. I picture my 8 year old self watching the prison break series and just get overwhelmed by nostalgia. I wish this fortnite era would end and we could go back to 2013/2012
bro i used to watch your minecraft vids all the time then i came back to see whats been happening over the years and i watched your first video on this new world and i was already feeling like a kid again then i'm watchiing the second video and i see your intro and i started to giggle my guy giggle.... im so glad you're back
This is serious nastolgia. And I understand what you mean.
You have/had depression:c? BTW don't hide depression under drugs...it won't help...idk I never got depression but I do know that when I'm feeling down I surround myself with friends family happyness and we're here to help (I'm literally crying right now because your sadness makes me want to help)ps. Try to apologize to your friends that you lost
My 10 year old self is loving this
Play with Ross or are you not friends any more
you get crtitical hit
yo adam, you see that little dagger icon for whenever youre attacking? basically the higher it is the more damage you deal. if the bar is maxed out, you can deal max damage for whatever weapon youre using
Didn't Sky have a 2012 Minecon cape?
WE LOVE YOU SKY
HOPE YOU GET BETTER AND COME BACK TO YOUTUBE

EDIT: I remember when I was like 8 to 11 and I absolutely loved your vids Sky. Things like the roleplays and mod showcases were my favorites, like the Maze Runner RP you did a while back with Barney, Ross, and Aphmau, or the Pirates one. If you need some more time off, Sky, then we completely understand. But if/whenever you decide to come back, your fans will be waiting for you.
Try playing with more people. Not only does it allow you to have fun with others, but you have someone to talk to while you're doing it.
Can we revive our childhood game ?
Ain't nothing wrong with a little weed it's the good stuff
Adam I hope everything turns alright because when I was young when I was ever sad I come and watched some funny videos to cheer me up and I always go to your videos cause they cracked me up so much it brought so much joy to me and many other people as well.I hope for the best for you Adam for your future and I‚Äôll be watching you once again and be part of your sky army once again. So thank you for being part of my childhood mate and Making me laugh all the time.
aaaah the Bob Ross of Minecraft
I am so glad i decided to come back here
I started watching you since 2013 and I felt so sad when you left. But now that you‚Äôre back, it feels like all the good memories are flowing back. I don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôre going through though we‚Äôll be here supporting you no matter what happens
I love you sky
Adam . Pls name this survival series ( talking in survival ) pls . We woyld like it
Cops n Robbers please!
üíõ
Try and teach your son how to play Minecraft
I can feel my childish thought coming back
1:56 lmfaoooo
I'm sorry sky dous mincraft
Sky is subscribed to t series
Remember not to spam click when attacking monsters. Wait til the bar under your crosshair is full.
Sky you can get throw it and we are all glad you are back
No more minecraft plz because I am pretty sure that it's called sky does everything
I‚Äôm glad your getting help now sky. I‚Äôve struggled with depression and your videos actually really helped when I was feeling down. I hope us viewers can help a bit and hope you feel better. Also SQUID IS BACK
Love the videos!
Sprint in the water
You'll have to specify on what you want to know but I'll just throw a couple changes out there, as you said, there are Llama's, there are Turtles, there are Parrots, there's a combat system where you can't just spam attack anymore, you'll haveto wait for the bar to recharge and deal the usual amount of damage, there are Turtle Eggs, there's Swea Pickles, there's Sea Weed, you can't smoke it, there's Biomes for the Sea such as The Warm Ocean, etc, a lot of things have changed, if you need any help, just tell any of us =)
Why are you subscribed to t series?
Try sprinting in water
I have just lost all respect for you because of your subscription to T-series
Yo sky love to see you back mannnn
Yes
Sad he's subscribed to t series
stop using whom wrong reeeee
This is very surreal because it‚Äôs Adam, the same Adam I fell in love with when I was 9 and here he is talking about the same things I went through when he was gone. The humor he has is the exact same, it‚Äôs not my cup of tea now but n o s t a l g I a idk it‚Äôs weird cuz I never knew what went on behind the scenes but here he is talking about how his friends were there for him just like how my family was for me. 
Sky army forever :,)
You have a cool down after each attack. A bar is located under the crosshare and when its full you can hit a full damage with whatever item you have equipped. Also when the bar is full and you have a sword of axe on hand it will let you attack as if you slashed your sword from one side to the other, hitting other mobs.
Longer and more episodes sempie
Love u you where my child hood
i hope you get better and in a better place adam :). p.s. spaming attack doesnt work in the latest versions there is a cool down, if you spam it only does like half a heart or less per hit no matter what weapon you have.
OH MEH GURD!!! YOU BROUGHT BACK THE OLD INTRO! MY LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE! oh yeah, um... dont spam attack. it does WAY less damage now. you gotta pay attention to the attack indicator. and when its full, then attack. and wait for it again. its apart of a new combat update.
I love you, no homo
Gosh what he talks about hits so close to home. I went through a long phase where I felt entitled, and was judgmental and bossy- And it takes losing what you have, to realize what you had.
However comma, during that period I had where I was alone and lost everything-
-Realizing my mistakes and how I'd acted
-Literally having dreams of being with the people I loved, and having things back the way they were, but then I'd wake up to reality
I grew and learned a lot, and even though it was the worst year of my life, I wouldn't have it any other way.
It's so much different in real life than it is in movies or stories- where a villain or bad character changes. There's that guilt, and no matter who forgives you, sometimes you can almost never forgive yourself.


SAP STORY ASIDE HUEHUEHUE I hope the best for Sky; I watched him all the time when I was younger, and it's really amazing to see him still around.
the gods have given me a second episode
sky does everything you funny
Omg you were my child hood hero
Items now float on water
i dont have anything special to say other than hearing you talk like this again and playing minecraft makes me happy. I love you Sky
Potato farms are op for food and trade
I feel like i am 9 years and old again!!!!!
Take your time with getting better, and I know things will get better as time goes on. As well as thank you, for bringing back the memories. You're brave, for being able to tell over 100,000 people about this, to talk about your problems, and I, no, we, everyone, will know things will work out.
I thought you quit?
XD
i hope you get better
Your not a true fan unless you watch 14 minutes of adam talking and playing minecraft
I know that this is supposed to be serious, but you can't rapid fire the attack button, you have to wait until the bar under the crosshair fills back up
Dear sky(adam) i never leave comments like this but, I never related more to you than right now. I've gone through depression myself, it's hard and sudden. I lost all my friend's all bc i was ignorant and gave all my attention to someone who ended up hurting me badly, lied to me and broke me. But, you helped me with your vids. You're videos made me laugh so hard i couldn't breathe, even when i feel i was not good enough for something or someone. Just please know, that you can get better, there is so much people here to support you. You are , just put forward your best effort bc You've made my days worth living, so I'm sure you can do it for yourself as well, Just don't cave in. Everyone messes up, especially me üí™üèªYou can do it 
We believe in you
Im glad your back we all have missed you so much my famliy would fight a lot and your videos helped me though that when you left I accepted it and moved on most of us did but you all ways had a place in our minds and our hearts... FOR THE SKY ARMY WATCH OUT SKWIDS OUR KING OUR LEADER IS BACK...WE WILL REBIULED AND BE REBOIRN 100 TIMES BETTER THAN BEFORE!!!
I would listen for hours
If u run under water you swim
the 28 dislikes are squids
Sky is a T Series supporter.
Use the old opening at least once plz
Hhheeeeeees BAKKKKK
Resubscribed
On the bright side, most views you have are from the people who have stuck with you fam.
Adam you have my respect for your bravery and thank you so much for giving me back my memories of the good old days also I almost cried when I heard my childhood scream guess who‚Äôs back from the dead and I hope your older friends give you a second chance because you were offered one and you‚Äôve been given a respawn where most others don‚Äôt I love you bro(no homo)
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone comment on weed yet üòÇ
NOSTALGIAAAAA
Hey sky, pass the boof
What‚Äôs the Minecraft server?
dabs
If you need help with depression you need to be save ask lord jesus Christ to save you cry out to him then he well help you with your depression and the lord love you
4:47 Oof.
:')
Whoever dislikes this video is a horrible person
also, the newer 1.9 combat update makes things different.
you are playing in 1.13/1.14
if you can find an ocean, you can find underwater structures with diamonds in them








If you read this Sky, I miss all of your old minecraft vids but your mental health is more important...
but you go with your own flow! Love you SKY ‚ù§
Yes
why is the dislikes exactly 69???
Sike, I'm only wearing one wireless headphone and it's in my RIGHT ear.
Glad to hear you're getting treatment and help. Feels kind of good to have someone on youtube talk about serious stuff and such, i hope the Buttery road will lead you to good luck and away from squids! But seriously take all the time you need to recover
I have once again found myself in my seven year old body, watching Minecraft videos because I honestly had nothing better to do, and thinking that swear words were just completely innocent things to say.
Hey Adam, I remember watching you as a kid and making my day as you were my hero, I hope you get rid of your depression soon.
Yeah, I have depression too. YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES MINECRAFT SO EXCITING, IS THE WINTER MOUNTAINS WHERE YOU CAN BUILD A CAVE INSIDE IT. :D
Keep fighting. I would say, if you can, reach out directly to the people you lost and apologize directly. Don't leave things up to fate. Reach out and try to mend the broken bridges.
Man is this bringing back childhoods memories of old sky
Hey Adam, long time recruit here, I just wanted to tell you that no matter how you feel or what you are going through or think about, you can always open up to us and we will never judge you. Also, I hope someday when you are confident in yourself again, do you ever think DJ Baby Mason will make a return to the videos?
He‚Äôs back
I grew up watching this guy, im 16 now I started watching when I think I was like 8 or 10, I really can't remember its been awhile, I have seen all your friends come and go, I really miss the old days but i'm happy to see you getting better and to see you happy, ill always be here Adam, whats another 7 years huh.
Same
Skydoesminecraft as an anime girl.
2019 worse then 2018
I looked through skys subscription page...
T-series huh?
This brought me well back and hit me hard. Sky was my first gay crush (because 2011 was wild) and I suffer from pretty severe depression. I really really hope he gets better. There's a big part of my heart dedicated to Sky
hhhhhhhhhhhh dad... you're back...
Sky I really want to say I hope you‚Äôre doing well in treatment and I want you to find yourself again. We all want to thank you for coming back and being super nice to all of us. We are always here and even though we can‚Äôt do much, we do our best. Thanks for all the nostalgia and work, I wish I could do something better to help I just want to give you a hug bro. All I want is for you to finally be yourself because you seem so sad but the best part about you is you still break through it and try to entertain us by being funny and still expressing your fun side even though you‚Äôre hurt. It pains me personally to see my childhood fall apart. Thank you so much for everything we love you sky ‚ù§Ô∏è
Dude.... my childhood dude....
The squid
Sky, we got you fam.
Hey sky, this will probably get lost in all the comments, but I just want to say that you should know thatyou are cared for. I'm sure there are tons like me, people who your laughter and "comedy" (lol jk you were really funny) brought out of dark places. So it's only fair that we're here for you when you need it
You shouldn‚Äôt spam click, it deals more damage to click wait click wait click
Is it me, or was this video reuploaded?
Adam you need  to do a Fortnite do not laugh
‚ù§Ô∏è
They added llamas a long time ago lol
Adam, please, just stop SPAM HITTING!!! Pay attention to the damn charge bar...
hey sky if ur wandering why mobs are not dyin as fast  they added a charge speed on weapons so dont spam also they added crossbows
But seriously though, Adam? You are beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. We're here for you, and you honestly deserve everything and more. I'm not going to pretend that everything will be rainbows and sunshine within the next 24 hours, and I'm not sure if it will, but any step you take is something. We're here for you, always.

Holy crap this was deep. Sorry for ruining any banter but yeah.

-The Sky Army/ what you want to call us now honestly
For seven years I was alone, I was targeted by people because I was alone, but every day when I got home you were there. I don't understand what it's like to have depression, but I know it's a hard thing to deal with, and I hope you pull out okay. We all missed you.
A couple of tips: When you're fighting, don't just spam click. Wait until the little bar in the middle of the screen fills back up until you hit again. It does more damage. Also, they didn't just make it easier to ascend and descend in water. There's a whole swimming animation if you're sprinting in the water. It's a forward stroke, with the arms moving outward, and the legs kicking, and everything.
I cried
<3
Sky and Deadlox used to be my favourite Minecraft YouTubers back in 2013 where they did a Christmas Parkour video together , I remembered Deadlox skin wearing a headset
I remembered watching Adam's old videos and i just wanna let Adam know that im a big fan and watching his videos made me happy but you can clearly see the difference in his old videos and now and adam has my full respect for still staying and being strong and that how Adam is looking after himself and how he knows whats good for him and whats bad even after everything that happened and with all that just shows how real reality can be..
Does it annoy anyone else that he doesn‚Äôt let the sword charge up that‚Äôs it though the vid was (sheds a tear) nostalgic
Wooooow #skyarmy #nobodies also keep at it with the music and also i was wondering if you ever want to do a collab cause I‚Äôve been making music but i haven‚Äôt recorded it
Who... whom..... WHOMST
Dont swear
At some points he sounds like leafy
Hey bro Idk if you‚Äôll see this comment but I just want to give you all my love and support and how much I appreciate bringing my childhood self back but also how happy I am for you trying to become your better self, not trying to be all preachy but want to say I believe in you and have faith in you and know that as long as you stick with it you will get through your tough times. I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS and I‚Äôm sure everyone else does! IM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK MAN!
Tacocat
I'm sorry for what you're going down, I hope you can get through it all
Adam ur alive?
we love sky :)
Maybe you should actually sprint, use CTRL to sprint. You can change the button if you want in the ‚ÄúControls‚Äù!section. Also applies to swimming, they have new animation for it.
I thohght you quit lmao. Music didnt work so well huh. Just goin back to a quick cash grab. Sad and pathetic.
My favourite thing about Adam‚Äôs revived interest in Minecraft is him finding out about all the new stuff they added
hey sky your biggest down fall will be your strongest recovery  you will later find your true self at the lowest point it come at you fast but goes quick  i had a cousin who passed at the age of 2 weeks and a brother who passed at age 3 and a 1/2 thats when i know i had great friends  the people who are always there for you need help come ask me or find me on face book im 16 and went through so much and i found music was the best why to help find music that will tell you the same life story you are trying to tell sorry for the long paragraph but your not alone with the pain and i will help when needed
yay thanks im late sorry
I‚Äôm gonna cry
OMG 8 YEAR OLD ME IS BACK
I really do like the idea of Sky making a huge throwback to the times where people loved watching Minecraft videos, and would just love watching these big YouTubers like Sky, but with Nostalgia, there comes a price..

It doesn't feel the same. The idea of him bringing this back is great, I'm sure, but times have changed, some for the better, and some.. Reluctantly, for the worse. Sky, loved the old Minecraft Content, but.. It's not the same.
This is sexy
The fact that these Vids aren't getting many views is fine. It shows that those who are watching are those who will be here for the ride, those who truly enjoy your content and missed you. We welcome you back into this game and with the smaller community, I feel like it'll be easier to reintegrate to mincraft and YouTube in general.
You could read a read a book to release you‚Äôre stress.
When your little sword icon underneath your crosshair refills between hits, it's actually much quicker to let it fill before you hit (no spamming), cuz it does a lot more damage and also damages enemies around the one you hit. It also saves on durability. And if you sprint while in water, you actually go into a horizontal swimming position and move really fast
Oh no
buddddderrr
I found home...
Butter?
Remember he would get 1m views in a day, now look sigh
I'm so sorry
What happened to deadlox?
I hope you get over this hill and I believe in you so does us sky army I hope you get better and I will wish your an amazing year even though you are hurt and injured from depression and anxiety I know you can get though this you have us sky army here to support you and I love this series and have an amazing day everyone bye
now the only question i have is...




are you still friends with Ross and Max?
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
to the people who disliked this video.... how dare you... why? BUT! some advise that I give to you Adam is to just surround yourself with those who make you feel happy and welcome, don't let judgement get the best of you when meeting new people, you might just miss out on having a friend that will never leave your side no matter what, get yourself a friend who makes you smile just by being around them, and not a fake smile, a real smile, let their aura drowned you with positive feelings and emotions, trust me it's the best, I'm actually one of those people who does that to others, my energy from my ADHD and my aura just makes everyone happy, and I'm glad I have good friends.
When you‚Äôre a kid and you are depressed but don‚Äôt have a weed plug ):
It's rewinD timE!
What happened to all of your equipment? You used to have a huge office/studio.
what
Those squids are back!!
Those 30 people who disliked are retarted
You can swim by pressing cntrl and if you want to do the most damage to one enemy you will need to jump then while your body starts to fall down hit with your sword but if you want to do an attack that hits multiple enemies at once then just swing with your sword when the bar of the sword has been filled up. Btw you carve wood now so you can carve trees to put check marks so that you won't get lost.
Hey Adam. I‚Äôve been watching your videos ever since I was really young and I‚Äôve gotten so much joy out of them. You‚Äôve helped me get through so much because I truly felt that you were right by my side chasing budder and killing squids. I can‚Äôt pretend to understand everything you‚Äôre going through but I just want to tell you that I know you‚Äôll get through all this and that you‚Äôll find who you are. You‚Äôre strong, man. Think of the thousands and thousands of people you‚Äôve entertained. You‚Äôve helped all of them get through their problems. You can get through yours. Thanks for all the laughs and smiles Adam. You‚Äôll get through this.
Can u stop acting emo
But hey I wish you luck
Yo Adam I want to see the return of squirl friend aka your pall rooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosssssss
wait
Beds require the same wool color now so don‚Äôt grab random colors. Spam clicking with sword doesn‚Äôt work anymore, there is a cooldown. Many new mobs and structures. Feels good to see these again. And like, if you weren‚Äôt enjoying it I wouldn‚Äôt be as happy, but you seem to enjoy the nostalgia
Any one else wants sky to bring back mine pranks?
Adam, combat update, you can't spam hit things anymore, you have to watch that bar just below the crosshairs to fill up and then hit it, and that deals the most damage.
Why was it taken down?
It's honestly great to have you back Sky. I first became a fan when I was 12, and back then you were just someone I liked to watch play minecraft. Now I'm 17, and you're now also someone I can relate to, as I have my own similar struggles including depression. You're actually the very first YouTuber I became a fan of, and a big reason why I myself wanna make videos for a living. Just remember we love you, and we'll support you in any way we can.
for me, sky helped me so much through stuff. and i was literally 7 when i started watching him. and when he cursed and all that it was so funny to me. and while my mom and dad were arguing, drinking, smoking, self harming, i was there a 7 year old watching sky does Minecraft. i mean what else could i do? sky, you helped me so much. you honestly remind me of what my dad did. you know, smoking pot. my dad didn‚Äôt fight like you though. Adam, you are doing so good. keep fighting
Me returning to my 7 year old times
hey Adam, i know you probably wont read this, but i want you to know that i appreciate the fact that your trying to be open and get help. you've been such an inspiration for me, and you might not know it but you've helped more people than you know through your content. i cant imagine what your going through but i know that whenever i felt down you helped me so much and made me laugh and cheered me up. seeing you do more content and bounce back from everything slowly but surely, it just makes me so happy knowing that someone can be so strong, or at least hide their fears, anxiety, and sadness so well. i know that was a lot but i really just want to say thank you. for everything you've done over the years. with minecraft, your music, vlogs, gta, and so much more. you're such and amazing person. i hope you're depression gets better and that the rest of your life treats you well. again, thank you so so much
I was 12 when I watch adam now im 18
I'm crying. I love this. I love Sky.
play more minecraft or minecraft server because i will love it we will love it also we thanks to you for making a cool video sky
We support you Adam, you get yourself back together, we are here for you adam
I definitely have been trying to self medicate too with weed and I really did have extremely similar effects. It made my mental health worse without me realizing it until I was at rock bottom. I‚Äôm now seeing a psychiatrist to finally better myself because I have lost so many people in my life for not taking care of myself. Honestly just reflecting and taking time to myself has helped me.
Listen Adam, or sky, or whatever you want me to call you, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll see this but I have to say this, you were my hero and savior, literally. I was in a point of my life of what your feeling right now. I‚Äôm only 16 and felt a lot over my life. You saved me from suicide attempts and... you saved my life. Your videos helped me a lot when I went through depression and when I get my anxiety attacks. You really helped me and still help me to this day. Everything you‚Äôve done has really helped me through my darkest. When I felt no hope. When I felt like no one needed me. I love you and you will always have a special place in my life and in my heart. I hope you do well in the future and say hi to your son for me! üòÇüò≠
Swimming animation
adam you need to stop spam clicking on animals, it does less damage now
you really gotta stop spam hitting. it really isn't helping
Gold  Apple
Ya know, I despised you when we were young back then, just because you were addressing a younger audience. But honestly, mad respect man coming back and making a video like this. Looking at the mini game video and then looking at this, I can understand that you just want to play some games and all. Cheers dude.
I don't think nobody mention you can craft a shield. You need 1 iron and 6 wooden planks. Place the iron at the top middle and surround it with wood. Put it on your off-hand and crouch to use it. It can block arrows and attacks from other mobs
Ligma
If you want to cure your depression, get a social life and do some exercise
Does all your subscribers are part of that we help you to feel better and we are all here for Adam the butter army  is here for you
I have depression and I haven‚Äôt been eating properly and sucidal
I‚Äôm surprised he re-uploaded this I don‚Äôt know why he deleted it in the first place
I now what your going thew im 13 and i have dupesin your not alone
Don't spam your sword you get a sword loading bar and when it fully charges you get a splash effect with the hit.
SKY VS SSUNDE
I know someone who used weed for depression, for her it was one of those things that made her worse before it made her better. She doesn't recommend it unless done with extreme caution. The way she explained it was that it made her face her problems, which isn't always the best thing when depression gets really bad. Plus, you need to look into the cannabis strain, some are really only good for physical pain (I've heard good things about that too) and some are only good for mental issues. There are also ones that do both, but again, the ones for depression can bring you to a darker place before it brings you to a lighter one.
It‚Äôs amazing watching someone that I loved and really enjoyed to watch fall but now is coming back and with some compassion. I don‚Äôt know if this will get to you Adam but if it does just remember that we hear you and are here for you.
You can press ctrl to swim faster adam.
Also you cant spam your sword anymore, you have to space your attacks <3
I can feel happiness coursing through my vains
i know i missed something because this is a reupload
Sky as for what you've missed there's a lot , there's a picture I found to sum it up but I cant figure out a way to show you it
you should watch the hermit craft series and learn from them on how to get better
I feel my minecraft routine tingled my neck
this is awesome
Just waiting till he finds B U T T E R
i forgive you adam i still love you you can play minecraft or another game i will love you till the end
I watched for years and I decided to come back to check it out and I love how your content has grown with your fans and it shows how much you have grown I love your videos and will continue watching.
9 year old me is glad you're back #LeftEarStuff
Someone needs to tell adam that spamming a sword doesn't work anymore like it used to
i‚Äôm crying tears of joy for you
Damn
I love adam.
Wait you‚Äôll listen to my advice? Then I won‚Äôt leave an essay, just the most basic- Combat has changed. Spamming attacks just breaks your sword. Wait until that bar below your crosshair fills up before swinging again
MINECHAFT!!!!!!!
I want ross
Does he know about 1.9 PVP?
hi adam!
i hope you remember me..
but may be you dont,but please know i fully support you, seeing you grow into so much pain breaks me because i have too.
alot of thing can help you to help you be yourself!, though i agree medicine wont exaclty help therapy might, i also suggest you play with friends it makes people feel more cheerful!!
ranting to us can also help people support you and except you  i may not know a lot but i really wish you could be happy
(and.. please dont smoke.... please..)
This made my night. After stressing about homework and tests and trying to pass junior year this calmed me. Thank you sky I loved your videos back then and loves them now. #LeftEarStuff
Thank you Adam or Sky I'm glad your back and I hope your friends come back too. It's just that I've missed my childhood heroes and it's nice to see some are still here. 
#SkyArmy
How did you know I only had my left headphone in
Its ok sky. We still love you no matter what we hope you get better. And be safe sky‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
I love that fact he back if reminds me when I was 9 staying up late watching ur hunger games
I can feel my 10 years old self again hahaha and that second intro wow i missed thatüíû
Wait to hit with your sword till the mini sword on the screen is full
The old intro yay
#LeftEarStuff
I was wondering if you could see yourself doing like some mini game videos like survival games.those use to be my favorite things to watch when I was younger and sometimes I enjoy going back and rewatching them to this day. I hope going and getting treatment helps you feel better and I hope you are also able to find great joy in making Minecraft videos. I know I enjoy seeing you start to upload more!
I woke up to Adam chasing a cow with half a heart.
whom intensifies
Time your swings with your swords
Adam, dont spam the sword. If you see that small sword icon under your hotbar, thats an attack cooldown, if you wait till thats full, it will do maximum damage
Funny you are actually in my left ear.... XD
Wow hes playing minecraft again?
Spam clicking pvp doesn't work anymore it's from the times before 1.9 you see the sword under the cross wait until it fills up and then hit again.
Sky does cocaine
What about munching brotatoee
its so strange to see you uploading again. i remember watching your stuff in middle school. and then nothing for the longest time. now im graduated and hella old. appreciate you sky hope you're holding up okay. <3
Thank you sky you cured my depression
NOSTALGIA ALERT!

9 year old me would love this!
WE LOVE SKY!
I missed this. I feel like a 9-10 year old again. Ily Adam. Bless üôè
Crazy Adam, I have been watching ur videos for the rest of my childhood,  and I enjoyed every minute of ur videos. 
U were my childhood... Thank you 

I hope u get better and have a happy life,  cuz u gave me a happy childhood
I have been watching since the old jump map days
I'm happy you're doing better and getting thr help you need....it honestly makes me happy that you're getting better and trying to find your self again
BEEN HERE SINCR DAY 1 on 37 different accounts
My jaw dropped so low when I saw the old intro omfg
the left ear trick just made me think my headphones were broken so I actually went to mess with the chords to see if it would fix :/ /
#leftearstuff
Thank you for 5 year old me for loving this
Enter enthusiastic screaming here.
Tears...
Im sorry to say this But do people still play minecraft it sounds bad when i say that also keep pushing the fame of minecraft ok Good luck
I feel young again
Hugs
Oh no did he lose the butter sword ?
Adam rest
Look man, I love ur videos and I've been seeing them for a while. In my opinion the only way that you can get back up is by getting everyone back together and apologizing directly to them,( face to face ).
Hey Adam, in the middle of your screen is an indicator. It needs to fully charge up befire you can do the most damage per hit ‚ù§
HOW DID HE KNOW I WAS LISTENING WITH MY LEFT EARBUD ONLY AHHH
I'm not even joking he said it's me in ur left ear again and one of my ear buds work......and it's in my left ear....Iü§Ø
He's back
y'all mind if I cry ? ? ?
Hope the treatment is going good, love you Adam
Can someone teach sky the new combat update.  The bar in the middle needs to fill before u can swing full power
Spread the word that the Butter king is back.
Adam, in order to do maximum damage (and save durability on ur sword n stuff) you need to wait for the tiny sword bar near your reticle to charge before hitting something again. Rapidly hitting something does like half a heart with a stone sword. Also axes do the most damage but have the slowest recharge
You can do it sky! We all believe in you! I wish you the best of luck!
Omg the nostalgia!!!
This is so blessed
90% of childhood restored
Finally! The wait is over! So eager to watch this!
I fing missed you your  littralky ny favorite youtuber i rember eatching you during the summer i had a lot of famliey problems and i was   beaten as a kid but your vudeos made me so,happy i love you sky and  ¬ø  im glad your bacj i hope your recovrey is gonna be blissful trasition into being back ti your old self i had a lot of deression and your videos was how i medicated it i will always be proud t be part of the sky army ik this comnent probaly wont reach you but if you do,read this and see imglad your back and i wish you the best the numbrr one youtuber sky does mincart or adam thanks for coming back im so,happy
On a Minecraft related note Adam they changed the way they work: if you see the little sword at the bottom, when you swing your sword, it goes down then fills back up.  You do more damage when it‚Äôs filled up and if you hit without the sword going up, it‚Äôs like hitting things with your fist.

On a serious note: I‚Äôm glad to see that you‚Äôre already doing better. It‚Äôs nice to hear everything and I‚Äôm actually really enjoying listening to it.  Keep it up! :)
On the real though what happened between you and Jason?
Haha jokes on you, you were in my right ear
9 yr old me is sending this to my friends
Are you actually wanting to play minecraft sky?
GET DAT COW
combat has been updated, so the sword icon under the crosshair tells you the cooldown between hits 
also sprint in water to swim fast
GOOD LUUUUUUCK
throws confetti WOOOO NOSTALGIA TRIP!
I thought I already have seen this

Did you reupload this video?
Ive been watching your videos since I was 10 now I'm 16 and I still love your videos Adam thanks for making my childhood
Isn't this a reupload? I'm not complaining though
Sky is back, Jonas brothers are back, Hannah Montana is back


My childhood is reassembling
"WE LOVE SKY"
At this year(2019) your younger audience from 2012-2014 are basically doing uhh... things...
WE LOVE SKY! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
WE LOVE SKY
Bring back sky media
Damn those squids are back!!
Hey Sky, I dont know if you're reading this but I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I hope everything works out for you, you've given me countless hours of joy all throughout my childhood and i just want to say thank you, i remember first watching you way back in 5th grade and the smile it brought to my face, your videos helped me through some tough times in life and I just want you to know that I'm grateful for joy you have given me
Therapy session with sky. What could be better
Can I hear Adam say budder at least once
We love sky
Why does everyone keep disliking his videos
My 10 year self is happy
We love sky :) üíú
THOSE BUTTER
PRO TIP: 
If you hold control while underwater you swim faster
Keep getting better man! Love the minecraft vids and how your getting better. #leftearstuff
I just love how real... and... honest you're being. Yes, I love how funny you are but, sometimes it's better to be real than fake your emotions. Love you.‚ù§Ô∏è
it seems over the last  year you have done an incredible amount of maturing and growing as a person. I'm really glad for you Adam
Tip: don‚Äôt just spam attack, wait for the meater to charge
Keep going man
GIT THE GANG BACK TOGETHER
How did you know you were in my left ear üòÇüòÇüßêüòë
WE LOVE SKY
1:58         Ah
Aw. He's so old to Minecraft that he doesn't know the new combat yet. 

Beside that, I know how he feels. I have epilepsy, and for treatment, I've been given medicinal marijuana. And when I'm on that high, I realize that how I care for myself high vs sober makes me feel really bad. We all have our trials, Adam. Everyone here still loves you, hell, you were my childhood. 

Nothing starts until you take action, and we're all glad you did.
Medical marijuana
We love sky!
whom
Ok it‚Äôs been a few years since he apparently left. This showed up in my recommended and now I‚Äôm in tears. Sky you help me so much I‚Äôm so happy to see these kinda of videos again, I love you dude
Adam/Sky/Net inspired me to do a lot of things like Music, YouTube, Acting, Taking off my Masks, Playing Minecraft is also a big one.
If you get enough string, flint, feathers, and sticks. Make a ** load of arrows and a bow and drown a Zombie... Now if this works they WILL turn into a "Drowned" in which you have a chance to get a Trident... After that collect 6 iron and 1 wood plank to make a shield. There is a knowledge/recipe book in your inventory menu below the 2x2. If you forgot a recipe {or in your case a new one} it'll be useful. Also... Murder everything you see! You're Welcome!
WE LOVE SKY. 

Sad i have depression too. i understand

So if you need anything i will be around in youtube! i will understand.
dont spam click your sword! it does a TON of less damage than if you wait a second in between hits!
Dame Minefeels
Thank you so much for doing what your doing. It feels nice seeing you returning to your roots keep up the amazing work!!!
You were one of the only people that kept me happy during the terrible times I had back in middle school, I'm glad to have you back again buddy.

Take care, and I wish you all the best. :3
Is this a re-upload..?
Technoblade vs skydoesminecraft 12:27



Adam get better :)
i honestly truthful understand- and i looked up too you when i was much younger. so thank you for making me smile and be the real you "sky"
Been here since Who knows when. Im 16. I was maybe 10 when i started watching you. I understand what you‚Äôre going through and fully support you. Im proud to have grown up watching you grow as a person. Thanks for making me laugh Adam.
Sky, I'm glad u managed to open up more and tell us how u felt back then and how u feel rn. We all appreciate wat you've given us, and we'll keep on supporting u! Thank u!
You can‚Äôt spam attack anyone, they made a thing where when you pause it does more damage.

Also when you land after a jump and then attack, you hit more critical hits.
We must get the attack cooldown mechanic into his head
Just a suggestion maybe try to talk to the people who you lost and try to make up and get back together with them slowly
I grew up watching your videos man. And I'm sitting here as a 20 year old college student now with a full time job, and hearing you talk about everything you've been through really hits me and makes me understand that even though everything bad I ever went through growing up, my depression and anxiety and everything like that- it defines who I am yeah, but it doesn't have to affect me negatively. It can motivate me to be better than I was before and to be better for the future. There's more I wanted to say but I don't wanna make this too long so:

Glad to see you back Sky. It's kinda like saying hello to an old friend again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
fooled me once, I realize my mistake, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me three times, It's starting to become a pattern.
Don't swing so fast and you'll do more damage, if you wait till the bar underneath your crosshair you'll see the difference
This is such mega-nostalgia to my childhood that i'm pretty sure im going through puberty again.
11:39 omg AdamüòÖüíúüíúüíú
Mannn I miss this
Floop the Doop zombo
I support you sky
my left ear again
YOUR ALIVE!!!!!!!!!
Seeing him post again is bringing back great memories üò≠ We all love you Sky!  We never forgot you!
Saw u in my feed after good knows how long. Lmao love the old intro. Sucks you don't have the same views as back then. Keep doing what ur doing dude.
When you attack mobs and stuff attack slower kind of and when you attack jump and attack and you will do more damage also if you look at your cross hairs you will see a sword that's kind of your attack stamana
Hey man you can sprint underwater ti swin faster, and you can craft a Campfire -it doesn't need coal as fuel or anything, what you need to do is put some meat in there. And haha.... there's a lot of thing's in minecraft that you miss. Lov yo vids man keep it up
Man I remember the good old days when Minecraft was really at its peak. So much nostalgia.
Watch the entire ads for the man who framed my childhood
Adam saying whom instead of who to sound like a super intellectual
This makes me so nostalgic I‚Äôm cryidkdndndn-
We support. We respect. We love. You‚Äôre gonna make it man.
Was this re uploaded?
Caveman sky
I remember this
I know what you are going through it took me many years for me to get out of mine I was lucky that j never got Into anything too deep that I could not get out of but th web people who helped me the most was my family and that's who n would gm talk tk about this cuz maybe they can help you work though this
really enjoyed the episode
You will pull through SKY
What happend to ross and them
the advice I would give for the game?  be aware of the new threats and aids.  try to keep a bed with you.  not sleeping for extended periods can cause phantoms, large bat like monsters, to spawn in.  they swoop down to attack, can be difficult to hit, spawn when you don't sleep, and will hunt you down when you futilely try to outrun them.  if you plan on moving a lot, get an alpaca, they can equip a chest and are more useful for transporting items than horses, and can wear different colored carpets for aesthetics.  be careful if you come across a mansion in the woods, as there will be loot abound, but also the dangerous vindicators and evokers.  though they may appear to be villagers, the despise all who the see, the vindicators attacking with axes and the evokers with spells and summoned minions.  this last one is an old one, but get a cat and a dog, because dogs fight and scare away skeletons, and cats chase away the creepers for some reason.  I hope this was helpful.
Aww im miss my 12 year old self
You‚Äôre our hero.
PEWDS does everything, not you
Just Stay strong . Your my childhood :)
Glad you're doing better! You can actually sprint while underwater and go super fast while also looking ridiculous with the swimming animation :)
üé∂You can‚Äôt only build 
but you also mine
This is always fun timesüéµ
You make my day don't stop what you are doing
What? No! Team Crafted is still a thing! Sky and the gang are all still friends! Don't lie to me!

please, don't lie..
Yo could you put on a faithful texturepack.
Love ya sky, don‚Äôt give up, the harder life is the more powerful u come back, it‚Äôs pretty cheesy but still
Glad ur back I‚Äôve been here sense gta and hope ur getting better thank u for coming back good luck
Reupload?
Didnt you already do episode 2?
So for anyone interested. Pot only makes things worse after multiple uses. In otherwords it is a temporary fix that will make things worse.
WE LOVE SKY!!!!
Also, when u fight mobs and animals, wait for the white bar to fill before hitting it again or it will do like a half a heart of damage
I feel like I'm 6
Love you, Adam!! I hope you take really good care of yourself! Stuff like this is really hard.. I know, I've gone through it, and I still am (except the whole weed bit). I'm not really good at talks like these..haha. I wanna see you get better for us, kay? <33
Hi
What happened to him and goob?
WE LOVE SKY
May I ask what ever happened to your wife
Its the people that you surround yourself. those that are positive and helpful will be much more well helpful than those who love doing stupid stuff and doing drugs etc. I myself haven't had depression, but I've been around a lot of people that do have it and i can say for a fact that if you are there for your friends, or have friends that are there for you, it will make everything so much better. not necessarily easier because nothing in life is easy. Depression isn't fun nor should it be. but it can be defeated. and one thing i always say is "it will get better. i don't know when but it will". just know that you have to not only believe in yourself, but know that at the end of the road, you will be in a much better place than you are now or ever was. and the reason being is not because you have money or girls or fame or any of that stuff, but because you have the experiance, memories, and knowledge of what happened, and how to deal with it. and from there you can go and help others. maybe not to the point of "curing" their depression, but getting them to a point where you can tell them to get help and they'll listen. Good luck Adam. And know that you can do this. no matter how hard or how terrible it is. you can do it. I'm 100% sure everyone here will agree with me.
Its been a long time since ive been watching your videos because it felt like you werent being yourself and seeing this video and you reaching out... i felt like a damn kid  seeing you do this video.. take care man
Love you and everything you do Adam! I will always have respect for you and will pray for you my dude! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my god. The nostalgia of the mic quality, the partial seriousness. My childhood is coming back.
This is giving me my younger flash backs where YouTube was just simple Minecraft video
Yo Adam I‚Äôm glad to hear your getting help. My advice is just spend some time with those  people you consider your own. 







Also it won‚Äôt hurt to yell Butter lol
We believe in you Adam!!üíô
Ganers rise up
I love the cut from him fighting a skeleton to him in the woods with nothing...
you gonna finish your purge serier?
YOU BACK YAY
I missed you sky...
WE LOVE SKY!
<3
2:16 ADD in full force
üëç
Ty‚Äôs left foot?
I can feel 2010 again...
6 years and I‚Äôm still watching I‚Äôm 16 now but Adam was the first YouTuber I watched
Umm Hi Sky I Got A Question I Know This Been Serie been like 4 years ago But You Remember The Maze Serie? Can You Please,Please! Do Season 2 Because Its Really Intresting And It Would Be A Plasuse If You Could Continue The Serie, I Know You Might Not Continue it but I'm Just Saying Because I Really Love That Maze Serie I Would Be Really Happy If You Would Do it And I Know You Will Not But I Have Tried

 üòä Thank You For Reading This.
Reminds of me cool summer nights years ago when I‚Äôd stay up late watching Minecraft, how I miss those times, where did all that time go
Old intro



Adam I glad you are getting better
Really glad you actually did bring back the old intro, now it really is nostalgic lol
And Adam we all love u and hope you will stay safe and hope that you can go through depression safely and not hurting ur self . We love I adamüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
#leftearstuff

Also I'm happy ur back tbh I like this sky better because ik it's u being u no masks hiding anything I hope u get better and kick life's ass üëäüèΩüëäüèΩ

Omg omg omg my childhood is coming back again oh god hell yea
1000th comment
It makes me so happy to see you play again I used to love the mod reviews. From the bottom of my heart I hope you can get better
2019 comeback
3:36 Dang Adam that‚Äôs pretty deep.
Is this a re-upload I feel like this is the exact same as the last video
Llamas were added in 1.11
If you can, can you just do the intro no clip in the beginning cause I‚Äôm usually just really confused at beginning
I miss TrueMU aswell, whatever happened to him?
Makes me happy seeing him happy. He‚Äôs been through a lot and I don‚Äôt fully blame it (at least for the stuff we‚Äôve seen) for what he‚Äôs done. I‚Äôve supported him for a long time and god damn im not gonna stop anytime soon
u need to fill the attack bar then u attack so u deal more dmg, u can't just spam attacks
Hey Adam, i don't know when this was added but I'll leave it here anyways just in case. There are new mobs called husks. They are basically zombies but they dont burn in daylight and they spawn in dessert biomes
Bring back Island of Skies!
Did nostalgia just smack me in the face?
Also any of you guys OG Sky Army soldiers still around? Because I never left.
When he mentioned Ross and thunder muffin, it about broke my heart ;-;
alarm goes off 

R O S S T I M E !!

Sky: Gooby time!
One thing to remember with the new Minecraft, DON'T. GO. INTO THE WATER.


WATER ZOMBIES.
In short: if you WANT to make a series, do it. If you get tired of one, stop
[Oohing and Ahhing over the turtle]

Turtle: Yo where's the ocean fam?
Ok so...

I read the title aaaaand I wasn‚Äôt thinking of romance.

My mind instead came up with  cuthulu
*is this..  Real??  Oh my god... *
THE BUTTER GOD!  HE IS BACK!  PRAISE THEE!!!
Butter Army ~ A True Soldier Never Leaves The Battle Field 
The BUTTER ARMY SHALL RISE ONCE MORE!!!
Are You Staying Or Fleeing!!!??
My god. I‚Äôm a 17 year old kid and I just got teleported to a time when I was 6... the nostalgia is real.
Get Ross in this series PLEASE! üëè
Also,how old is Mason by now!? üòÅ
Someone needs to tell Adam how all new stuff in Minecraft works. Like how parrots make mob sounds!!!
Gooby: h0w tO gO DoWn lAdDeR??

If this becomes a series then theres a long road ahead of us boys.

Props to OG Sky Army
The parrot will imitate any hostile mobs within a certain radius around you, especially if there is a cave system beneath you
It‚Äôs a tradition to watch adam‚Äôs videos no matter what it is.
Things you may have missed:
1) Monsters at night that can fly
2) water zombies
3) Items for every type of wood
4) Turtles?
5) Dolphins
Anymore?
Awe, I love her and her voice is  so cute :)
I love Lovecraft!

How long until Cthulhu shows up?
When the alarm went off I thought it was Rosstime
Sky: I love you
Gooby: I love you too
Sky: Sorry I was talking to the turtle
If you want to do this series, then we want you to do this series. We will support you no matter whatüíï
Sky, I have been watching you ever since I was a kid. I'm glad your going back to what you like. I subbed back üëç
I missed the skydoesminecraft! üò≠üòÇ‚ù§
I'm in absolute tears, i haVEN'T FELT THIS JOY IN FOREVER! I'M SO PROUD OF THIS NOSTALGIC TURN!
I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs found gooby no offence but he‚Äôs other gf was a cu-
"I love you" "I love you too" IM GONNA CRY! IM SO HAPPY FOR ADAM!!!!!
Long time skyarmy member here:
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
Gooby alarm went off- 

Sky: is it gooby time?! 

Me: o my God who misses Ross time
Adam: THERE ARE POLAR BEARS NOW?!

Me: Holy Sh‚Äî‚ÄîAdam how long have you not been in Minecraft?

Adam:  What is that? 

Me: Wha‚Äî‚ÄîADAM.
To place guess what you need to do 
I wish I had someone who would get me butter..



Forever aloneüò≠
How to tell if Sky's gf/wife is his: Same designed skin, different details
Minecraft Guide:
1. Don't dig down
2. Make sure u get mostly wood and cobble so u can make stone tools and a temporary shelter
3. Keep moving until u find the best spot to build (I recommend a place close to a village)
4. Once you've settled down, keep some high walls to protect the villagers, beware the pillagers and their crossbows, be prepared for the pillager beast
5. PROTECT YOUR LOVED ONES AT ALL COSTS
Who's cutting onions?

I can't believe i can see old sky again this is a miracle.
Are we sure this isn't past Sky and Goob from the past before they knew how to play minecraft because they can't even operate the ladders.
I like how Gooby has a better mic than him XD
Plz continue this, its amazing! I have SO much nostalgia! Also u and Gooby r adorable together <3
I hope to god that gooby doesn‚Äôt betray Adam like what Alesa and Dawn did...
The noises are from the parrots.. they mimic the sound of zombies,baby zombies and creepers. 
Glad you're back sky and happy to see you're doing alright
Lovecraft aye? Gonna go fight cthullhu or smthin
Recommendation: it should be a server open to couples
The intro makes me cryyyyy

Nostalgia coming at me like a train XD
Sky, you can tame the parrot by right-clicking it with seeds. DO NOT GIVE THE PARROTS COOKIES, just BTW.
I almost cried seeing that old intro. üò≠ my little 13 year old self is peeing with excitement.. üòÇ
3:33
Sky:you know what we need?! We need a roommate just like back in the day!!
My mom:why are you crying so god damn loud?
Just letting you know that you can tame parrots with seed lol
You were probably hear a drowned (if that's the name)
It's basically a zombie that drowned and transformed into what I just said.
There are other new baddies as well but forgot their names lol
Bird joke: oh really im so raven

Ad: squawk away
Adam you can tame the parrot using seeds and they will sit for you also u should put a room in the same floor on goobys thats just water for the turtle
Sky mentions Ross

I haven't heard that name from you in so long
You two should seriously get a turtle. They're friggin adorable.
I've just started watching you now because a friend said you're cool! I like your content so far very much! :D
Yes I want this series, But if possible with Ross, Being the love Interest üòÇ
Aw! You should definitely continue it!!
It sounds so fun and interesting!
The parrot can imitate monster sounds
i have been watching you adam since, i was like 7 or 8 im 15 now but dude nostalgia is great, i just wanted to say no matter what you do the sky army will back you
"gooby time" gave me Ross time Flashbacks <3
6:25 that sound is the parrot, it will mimic sounds of near bye hostile creatures (zombie)
It's back it's finally back. after all these years he's finally doing another Minecraft let's play.
He has so much to catch up on.
This intro makes me feel so old. I can still remember the one before it as well.
I'd enjoy watching this
MORE LOVECRAFT PLEASE!!!! It‚Äôs a dream come true! üò≠üíõ
I look at this and I wish I was part of your family.
Might just be my Batson side talking.
Whispers the word Shazam
OMG... I HAVEN‚ÄôT SEEN YOUR VIDS IN YEARS AND YOU SOUND SO DIFFERENT

Life if you want to




Wait do you still say Gold is Butter
You have no idea how emotional i got when you brought up Thunder Muffin and butter i literally grew up listening to that UGH-
Awh, I love seeing him growüò≠ they‚Äôre so precious together
i know you will get better soon you are great and amazing
So wholesome that it hurts my heart god it‚Äôs good to have you back are butter leader your army is reforming
(Also would like to see more of this series)
This is amazing!
Also parrots mimic noises of nearby/mobs they have been around.
For example,it made a zombie noise and a creeper noise!
I cried when Adam Mentioned THUNDERMUFFIN R.I.P
This brought me back to a lot...it makes me so happy and ahhhh I don't know it brings back so much happiness 
His voice is also so calm it's nice and Gooby is amazing :')
Yes you should make the series
The parrot makes monster noises
Goobys reaction to the turtles was the EXACT same as mine 
xD
Btw the sound is baby zombie in the mountain
And I would like u go to the ocean and find dolphins
Its actually not Gooby Time but its....








ROSS TIME!!!
Bet loved the video just like the title says. 

Also the sound was the growls of baby zombies.
I MISSED THIS INTRO SO MUCH
I love you so much and you posting videos again makes my life complete you were literally my whole childhood‚ù§Ô∏è
Me: *  reads comments  *

Me: ( starwars meme ) do it.
0:17 that is what i build while teaching my friend how to play Minecraft
the same style 
same second floor
I never watched to original love-craft so I can't really make any sort of comparisons but I think it's a great idea!
He actually retrieved his mic quality back.
It's the parrot they mimick mob sounds
The nostogia!!!

Minecraft Prision Break?

Edit: Also yes, do this series
ADAM YES YOU SHOULD DO THIS! this would be awesome! and you could invite other members of the crew to play with you and stuff.




also, skybase, like, 3.0? 4.0?  either way you should make a new, improved one.
You don't sound like ur old self
(Can't blame u)
4:20 (heh)
When he was like 
"Yahhhh that's so cute I love it"
It almost made me cry I uwu so hard :')
Dude, any series you make is a godsend at this point
Yes please make lovecraft a thing.  I love these types of videos it reminds me of when I first started watching you.
3:06 oh boy...
Hearing Adams voice actually teared me up :‚Äô)
Keep doing it I love ur videos regardless what game u play
Sky I gotta say I have been following you on YouTube for a long long time and I gotta say that this was good, it's good to see ya happy, keep it up man!

I love it when you upload. I read the description and seen you were going to answer questions so I just have one. How are you doing?
Plz bring back the series. I'm dying to see it come back
I like this series it would be pretty epic,but sadly it reminds me of something (R.I.P AVAITOR)
Goobie time...*whisper under breath*...Ross time
OG fans can only like this comment
The noise is the parrot, when a monster is nearby it mimics it‚Äôs sound, in this case a zombie. You can also tame the parrots by giving them any type of seed. There are 5 different types of parrots, one green, two blue (different shades of blue), one red and one grey. You can also have baby turtles, and the turtles lay eggs (they are place able items) also a fun thing, if you play a disc on a jukebox near a parrot.. it dances! And the parrots once tamed follow you and will tend to sit on your shoulders (two can be on you at a time) to get them off, jump or if in creative fly. Hope you read this and are further educated on the new logistics of Minecraft. Oh btw the new 1.14 update is gonna come out soon, it‚Äôs has pandas, foxes, an actual cat spawner with different cat options, and new blocks along with a complete retexture of blocks and entities. Love you Adam, glad you could come back to play for us teenage baby child‚Äôs and make us feel young again! ‚ù§Ô∏è

As a fan of the Lovecraftian Mythos this was quote a troll video name
My god, I‚Äôm gonna sound like a nerd, eh- I don‚Äôt care.

In the 1.10 update, the Husk was added. The attributes are very close to the zombie except they give you a hunger debuff. So basically, they are a more annoying zombie. Fact of the day my dude.

My childhood yessss

the 42 people who disliked are gay
MAKE IT NOW REEEE
She best not hurt youüò≠
demonic screaming
Im just gonna put this here in hopes it helps a little bit with learning the new mechanics of the game as well as the dangers.
Ill explain the Mobs for now and explain the different Mechanics on a Later Episode.



New mobs introduced to Minecraft


Hostile Mobs:





This is what happens when you leave a Zombie underwater for too long.


Unless a Zombie is chasing you, it can't swim in the water. It will sink down and drown before turning into a "Drowned".
While they can spawn natrually in river and ocean biomes, the Drowned are a dangerous underwater entity.
The Drowned can hold a special item called a "Trident" which is a new weapon/tool within the weapons and Tools section of the Creative Interface. It is both a Ranged, And Melee item, which means you can charge it up to throw it, much better use underwater if combined with some new enchantments, ill talk about those later.
Another Item they can Hold are "Nautilus Shells" Ill explain later.
The Drowned are considered "Undead" so they will burn in daylight unless they are in the water, or its raining.

So these are the Items a Drowned can hold (With a chance to drop upon death):
Nautilus Shell
Trident
Fishing Rod


Drowned Can (With a chance to) Drop upon Death:
Rotten Flesh
Gold

Recommended Skills to fight them
Melee, swimming


Those are it for the Drowned




The Nightmares of the Sky


Thats exactly what they are "NIGHTMARES" that are attracted to Insomniacs. Better sleep on the regular if you dont want these dangerous creatures to spawn every night.
If a player is caught not sleeping for more then 3 days, that night, they will be greated by a group of these terrifying creatures, swooping down and biting at you till you perish.
I would be careful if you want to fly around these mobs for they can cast an effect on you that would highly prohibit flight from the Elytra.
You can tell they re there because they will let off this shrill like scream as they dive down towards you, which means you need to be on guard.
While they are terrorizers of the night, they will burn in the day unless covered. This can lead to situations where you have to hide away, or stay inside and sleep (if you can).


Way to Solve this issue?
Sleep on the regular.


Phantoms can drop upon death:
Phantom Membranes (Which are the only items in the game that can Repair an Elytra)


Ways to combat these mobs:
Melee, Ranged, Timing, Cats (They dont like cats and will run away when within 15 blocks of one)


Thats it for the Phantoms


Neutral Mobs (Dont hit these)


Dolphins!

They may be cute, but they sure are Dangerous if you hit one.


Ah Dolphins, One of the Cutest Minecraft Mobs ive seen as of late.

They are an underwater creature that can actually drown and die on land, strange right? Dolphins will cup up to the surface for air and submerge back underwater to play. Dolphins are playful and Joyful, they love to play with the player.
While swimming, if your swimming fast, a Dolphin will come flying up to you out of nowhere if one is to be close by and provide you with a helpful buff called "Dolphins Grace" which vastly increases your swimming speed, faster then the Dolphin itself, however this buff only lasts 5 seconds.
They will bat around items like toys, which means that if you drop something, it may be some time before you find it again.
They will swim with you if your riding in a boat (Which to me is the cutest thing ever), jumping out of the water.
Dolphins also will jump between water pools as they see fit, which means if you have 2 pools close to each other, the Dolphin can and will jump between them as they see fit.


However, if you hit one, ho boy, your in for trouble
Dolphins will attack as a pod, and deal quite some damage, the higher the difficulty, the higher the damage.


Dolphins can Drop:
Raw Cod (Which is basically Raw Fish)


Skills to Combat them
Melee, Swimming.


Thats it



Passive Mobs

Cod, Salmon, Tropical Fish, and Puffer Fish

These now have their own Mobs! They can spawn in groups of their own class and travel together.

Puffer fish however are a different story.
Upon getting close to one, it will puff up from its usual unpuffed size, and will poison the player if they are to touch them.

Upon death, the fish will drop their respective drops
Such as Cod, dropping cod, Salmon dropping Salmon, so on an so forth.
They can also drop BONES. Cheep bones? Worth the risk? Idk :T
Still. The fish are, i guess, Semi-new counting for the fact they are in the game but, dont have their own mob, but now they do!


I hope this info on Mobs is enough to help you get a grasp on how to combat them, should the time come up for them. If not, i hope it has at least helped somebody who hasn't seen these changes either.

See Ya Next Time!
Yes yes yes yes yes. Please keep doing this

Oof I bet Aphmau feels so replaced..
turtles are hard to take care off I should know because I used to own one. xD
I think Sky should play with his old friends and also collab with Mumbo and Grian aswell i think if he collabs with people he will get his skill back and make friends :D
I know it was just random banter and them being total noobs but I just watched this whole thing with a big grin on my face. It was so nice to just see things ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again and to hear genuine happy laughter and see them get pleasure out of the littlest of things like a turtle. Welcome back. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I had the biggest smile on my face watching this! I missed you so much, you are (in my personal opinion) the best creator out there on this platform, you made me smile on days when nothing else could. Watching this just made me feel like a kid again, despite me being in college. You do what you need to do sky, and we‚Äôre there with you!


One thing though, I was so sad when you deleted SkyVsGaming. Some people out there have a few videos that they managed to record before you deleted it, and I‚Äôve been watching those a lot lately because they were some of my favorite episodes with you. Whenever you find the time to, be sure to play some GTAV!
YES MORE

Adam freaking out over the parrot making zombie sounds is a mood
OMFG, IF YOU DID A TEAM CRAFTED REUNION...

Are the old skyvsgaming videos ever coming back or are they gone for good?
pls yes
The zombie sounds are zombies. They also might be baby zombies. We now have different cats, pandas, coral, shipwrecks, woodland mansions, different slabs, turtles, parrots (can be tamed with seeds), dolphins, drowned (sea zombies), wandering traders, berries, and many other things.
When I see sky play lovecraft with someone other than alesa 

Confused screaming

Sky, I think that sound is from a baby zombie. They're weaker than regular zombies, but faster and harder to hit, and they can sometimes be seen riding a chicken.
There must be a cave with monsters nearby that they are mimicking
Adam no hate but your girlfriend sound like a 15 yr/old girl from discord
I want this..... this is beauty at its fines

I love that sky is playing mincraft again. I can't help that notice that he seems to almost have a insecurity with being a youtube again. Like maybe he thinks he wont be as good.  I have hopes for him that he can be as great as he use to be
Also sprint in water to swim if not, sprint and look down, that mighy help
It's a zombie lol

Adam, the sounds you are hearing is from your parrots, they imitate other things. Also, tame your birds with seeds, then you can sit them down or have them ride on your shoulders (Yes if u have two, you can have 2 parrots on your shoulders). You jump to make them get off ur shoulder. I'm so excited to have you back on Minecraft! Maybe play on Hypixel and do a live stream so we can join you!

I just want you to make content that you enjoy.
I believe I was 10 years old the last time I watched a SkyDoesMinecraft video, hell even a minecraft video. I just wanted to say that you have been with me for a long time, and I even remember the days that you were kind of a prick in the old days of tutorials. Anyway glad you're back I guess. I more or less watched you for your jokes rather than the game which I am sure as HECK not gonna watch now. Atleast the gameplay. I will still watch ya for the jokes and your personality so keep being you!
Sky u r amazing.u make me smile and i consider u and the others family.i am always here for u if u need someone to talk to.that goes for all of u guys.im here for u

And i'm really happy that you're back to minecraft... I know that everyone has they're own bad/hard/dark times in life... So if you ever feel like really bad... You can count in us your fans and friends... Don't let the haters get to you...ok? I hope that i made your day becous you always make my day!‚ù§
I'm so happy that minecraft's alright to play now. All of the children are at fortnite and apex. We're safe.
Might be a drowned zombie
Sooooo.... is no one going to question the lava in the frozen tundra.... no ok then
The mob noises is the mimicking from the parrot warning you that there are hostiles near
Don‚Äôt do love craft. It‚Äôs a meme. It‚Äôs a shitty trend for 8 year olds. You‚Äôre better than that.

Sky: my mic quality
Sky: quits Minecraft for music

People: start playing Minecraft un ironically

Sky: 
Cops and robbers pls god I will cry so hard my eyes will grow new eyes and cry some more I've been here since I was 5
Old do not laugh: complex jokes with lots of building and planning
Do not laugh now: weener
The crew is back together again.
But what did it cost?
The audio quality.
Sky: uploads*

5 hours later

Me:

Welcome back, old friend. We knew you wouldn't let us down!

Ross: Do I look happy if I jump like this?
Adam: Yeah
Ross: Well I am really depressed right now. 

Best joke ever made in a do not laugh, does anyone remember it?
(Probably you do, but I am still asking :) )
Cops N' Robbers is a must have for one of your upcoming videos also, the memory build minigame or building and rating minigame
Adam: All you have to do is throw a sausage at me and I laugh
Me: *Throws Pufferfish*
No offense I liked the original rules of your do not laugh

Sky, ever since I have started watching your videos which was back in 2011-2012 when I was only 10 years old, I knew you were an important part of my childhood. Not long ago, I‚Äôve rewatched your old videos again and shed tears knowing a deep part of my childhood was gone, and how not only you, but the entire Team Crafted group separated. But seeing this episode made me know that you are still here, and that you are going back to the way of how you‚Äôve made millions of people love you. Please bring back the memories that we all loved and enjoyed...  
Thank You :‚Äô)

The only youtubers that I only know in this video...
Jerome and Adam....
And here I thought the bone to pick joke was something Adam was gonna laugh at üòÇ
OMG ADAM!!! YOU BROUGHT IT BACKK!!! YOU'RE SOOOOO AMAZINGGG THANK YOUUUU!!!?!?!?
(You also brought back the intro, but I honestly missed do not laugh more..)
I've been watching for YEARS and do not laugh was my favorite series. 
Last thing, get out the bathtub lmao üòÇ
JERIMEEEEE OMGGGGGGG
hears intro
turns into a 10 year old
One word.






Adam
I miss Ross ^
Did he get rid of his mic when he switched to music? This is super nostalgic
Back then he had million views he get them again just gonna take time

What I really miss is his replays 

IDC what anyone says we lost a lot of good YouTubers back then for him to come back show hope for the others
Mic quality

IS THIS REAL OR NO IM CONFUSED
*clicks on video and immediately starts crying
Was the audio recorded in a cave? ü§î
The fact that Adam is doing alright at the moment makes me so happy
Great Sky is subbed to T Series üò£ I want the old Sky back, he did the best content back then
I miss Ross, Tyler, and awkward. I miss Sky's handwritten stories. I'm not saying that this isn't making my happy, just watching this after so long is making me nostalgic.
Wdym he is back he was never gone ;)
I can't tell you how happy I am seeing that intro omgg nostalgiaaaaaaa
(This was your chance to ask where the hell flash is from Sabre)
Oh man, I really miss the butter intro

My heart today... First my favourite Minecraft roleplaying starts to end,  literally,  and now I'm seeing Adam do the best thing ever
[happiness noise]
I miss Ross and Barney and red
Adam, thank you. Thank you for just saving me, I don‚Äôt care if you read this, or when, but I hope it‚Äôs in a time if you need to know your self worth because you are worth so much. Since I was 8 (I‚Äôm 14 now) I‚Äôve watched you. To be honest I remember the first time you did a unboxing fan mail and I remember thinking ‚ÄúI want to give him scissors but rap it duct tape so it‚Äôs extremely hard to get to wishing her had those scissors‚Äù. You made me so happy, even when you didn‚Äôt upload.  Most of my life I have had depression and there are times where I do hurt myself, but I stopped because I take a breath and try and calm myself down. And when that didn‚Äôt work I watch your videos, before I know it  I‚Äôm not sobbing, I‚Äôm not wishing I was dead, I‚Äôm laughing. I thank you because lately I‚Äôm laughing a lot. Your my hero even if you don‚Äôt see it all the time, you don‚Äôt know who I am and we‚Äôve never met but I feel like you helped More then anyone. Thank you.
Woah nostalgia trip XD
OMG MY DAD IS BACK
Fluffy and Sky recording mincraft together, WHAT YEAR IS IT?! But for real, this makes me happy.

That intro holy crap. Haven‚Äôt seen that in a while.
Damn adam
Go old style. If you don't know the rules, there are four players one person in the middle. There are two ways to get a point. First person to three points wins. One way to get a point is to be the person who makes the person in the middle laugh. The other way to get a point is, if you are in the middle and you manage to make it through the onslaught of everyone's jokes, you can get a point that way. (Though that rarely happens)
Wait... Where Ross be
Where‚Äôs Barry and Ross
Anyone remember  WEEEEEEZZYY
9:18 Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit the... FLOOOOOORRRORRRRR

Me: tears of joy
HOLY CRAP MY FAVORITE SERIES IS BACK

sky you have made my day, or year.
I knew watching this would give me nostalgia. 

  But nothing prepared me for that mic I almost cried, I felt like I was watching it Adam back  when he first started making videos.
Dude I missed you so much. Your videos always keep me company!
Love it but would  but the system  of making  a individual laugh  was way funnier
I thought God was playing an April Fools joke on me. But no, these golden videos are back.
You needa do these with the original crew like barney and ross
Why does Adam sound like Kermit XD
WELCOME BACK SKY!! :D
my heart just got really happy
It‚Äôs amazing to see this series again.

Sky, what happened to you?
This looks like the exact place where sky filmed a video with the guys and he sings because he got the amount of likes he said on the other video
thats it why do people dislike the video even though he just started coming back do personally hate him or something because if you do just get out
WUT yes
Mmmm finally
Adam I have a single request, I'm a headphone user and I ask of you to get yourself a good microphone alike what you had in the past, I'm not hating or anything but my ears man.

Also loving that your doing videos again I have someone good to watch play videogames.
Bring facecam back and fix ehco plz thx

(Cooked in my bathtub)
someone should mention the poor kebab shop

Adam, I admire you very much. You're a funny person, and you bring joy to many. I'm glad to see one of these videos again. They make me laugh (ironic, cuz they're called Do Not Laugh Videos), and I missed them. 


But I am a little confused. Last I heard, you said you were trying to take care of yourself for a while, and you were done posting videos about minecraft for a while, so this video surprised me, along with your other minecraft videos lately. 


Not hating, just wondering: Is everything ok? Are you doing better?
The god has returned!
what happened to Ross and Barney and Jim Bob and aphmau and Max what happened and why did you change try not to laugh  those are my only questions Adam?
Even the video is a low quality. Man this is a nostalgia trip
Where do you find these guys?
Well I didn‚Äôt know he got back to Minecraft, well this is interring
Yo adam ik its a bit late but I hope you get well 
I hope and pray for your future

What is/are the mod/mods you are using
Ik it has been a while since you did a do not laugh, and normally I would laugh, but I didn't find anything funny to laugh about. It may be because of your new concept, but can you bring back the one where you need to make the person in the center laugh. Please
Back a couple years ago 
I use to be a really famous Minecraft YouTuberrrrrr
i cant today
Do a cops and robbers

Damn adam bringing back the old voice recording
I miss Ross
Memories
I want to see jesus
Sky kind of sounded like Kermit
My childhood
The quality of your mic is worse than the quality of my youtube videos when im watching.
I was 13 when I stated to watch your videos now I‚Äôm 16 and this video has taken me back to the old days !!!
What is this
I‚Äôm so happy
My dad finally came back from getting milk
Sky: ‚ÄùI‚Äôll see you later recruits!‚Äù

Me: Am I ever getting out of boot camp? It‚Äôs been 6 years
Hey sky, i am not a random 8 year old anymore typing in all caps on your videos anymore. Being extremely toxic to random people on the internet but i use to watch these videos a massive amount as a kid and you got me into Minecraft that thereby got me into Programming and making Plugins Mods, Engines and Games in a way i have you to thank for that. I became a Devolper on multiple servers and almost became a Dev at Mineplex.

You are not going to see these through the massive amount troll comment's of soon to be dead memes and "Thank god i grew up with Minecraft", you very clearly don't do this for the money this video has a large amount of View's and you could most likely milk it for all its worth for a very long time. 

These videos have given me a massive amount of happiness throughout my life and i hope whatever struggles you go through or whatever else, that literal millions of people have found comfort and possibly solace within your videos. It slightly cringes me to say this but here is to the Butter Army and of the Conquering of the Squids.
"Diorite... There's new stuff..."





Diorite was introduced like 5 years ago. Never change, Sky
My childhood has started reassembling itself 





Thanks
Skydoesminecraft is back.
My childhood is back.
The best youtuber is back.
R friend is back.
I missed u sky.
You think we dont wanna watch? 
this video is literally the best thing that has ever happened to me, thanks for everything
YouTube recommended does a good thing for once.
2016: meh, you're play minecraft
2018: better than fortnite
2019:you're play minecraft, that sick son
Adam, you and CallMeCarson are becoming the reason for the revival of Minecraft. And god bless you for it. I‚Äôve never had so much fun back on a game since Minecraft. And you‚Äôre bringing it back, it‚Äôs amazing. Thank you.
This feels exactly like an old video how did he do that
only the real g's remember when his name was "Sky does Minecraft"
Me: searches sky does Minecraft just cuz 

Sky: is doing Minecraft again

Me: oh, hi nostalgia
SkyDoesMinecraft missed:

-Pillagers
-Ravagers
-Smithing Table
-Fletching Table
-Cartography Table
-New Villagers
-New Textures
-Vindicator
-New Furnaces
-Bell
-Barrel
-Campfire
Nobody:

Skydoesminecraft: *uploads

Childhood: Look at all this butter
We can't even be mad about the fact that he doesn't fully understand the new things in the game. It just proves he was and now again is our SkyDoesMinecraft. We've grown up to come back. Just relax while playing, Adam. I've already thanked you for the past.
Some people are here saying
 "oh my God my childhood is back don't leave again"
 but the thing is...
for me at least...
I never felt like you left....
when I was younger and watching your Minecraft videos,
 I was happy...
about a year or so ago....
I discovered I have depression...
but...
I had your music to listen to...
and it made me happy......
and now....
you've come back to Minecraft....
and you're getting help at the same time as I am finding ways to cope.... 
we're both healing....
so....in realitiy....
my childhood never left me....
It grew with me...
And it'll keep growing with me...
It will guide me on my journey to adulthood....
Thank you Adam for being the person that I look up to...
Thank you for being the person who I called my angel during rough times...
You were my angel Adam,
It was like you lifted me off the ground onto my feet again....
Then taught me how to fly...
Keep being yourself Adam....
Because you've been so many people throughout your life
so many masks...
alter egos of who you are inside 
 Sky...
Netnobody...
Adam....
I can really tell Adam, that you're almost there...
With the help that you're getting...
The words you're venting....
I can finally see the true Adam inside you coming up for air...
And I know that you won't let him drown....
Because you're strong enough to protect him...
I'm so proud of you Adam....
We're all proud....
You've grown so much as a person...
And the loyal one's who've stayed have grown with you...
We stayed with you...
Because when we watched your videos....
we were never there for Minecraft...
or "Sky"....
we were there for you....
the real you...
because that's the you we truly love.....
That's the you that truly made our childhoods....
And that's the you that we know will never leave us....

We love you Adam 

And,
 as a long time member of the Skyarmy....
I salute you sir...
welcome home...


Sincerely, with all the love I can give,
-Amelia
YAY! YOUR BACK! claps WE MISSED YOU! 
edit : THE BUTTER KING HAS RETURNED!
I'll be honest with you Adam...the very moment I heard your voice I burst out into tears....
DID HE JUST END WITH I'LL SEE YOU LATER RECRUITS? THE NOSTALGIA IS REAL
4:05 has flashbacks of the squid war. THE SQUIDS ARE ON THE LAND.
Holy heck its like i got hit with the 2012 stick. Honestly didn't know how much i missed these videos. Love you dude,no homo, hope you keep making these because you are the most awesome.
Your Back Sky A miss You You were my favorite Youtuber I still remember The Videos From 2013
*Sky starts getting scared of the squid*
Me: H o l y S h i - How does he react with go- butter?
Thank god I grew up with skydoesminecraft and not ninja
Edit: Thank you guys so much for the likes. I really appreciate it.
"I'll see you later recruits!" 
Me: 'Burts immediately into tears of joy' Its good to have you back Butter King! Never change and if you do only change for the better of yourself.
Not many people you're back yet. YouTube hasn't really done its thing yet
But, what happened?
Your music career okay?
He protecc, he attacc.... but most importantly,
You can place double chests next to each other now. Yes. Mind blowing.
The Nostalgia rate is through the roof 

Muh Childhood it‚Äôs back
I'm glad you came back man I don't want to sound un greatful but   modshowcases?
What you've missed:
Phantoms
Coral
Seagrass
More fish
Shipwrecks
Arrows with affects
Dolphins
More stairs
More slabs
New textures
Diorite
Alot if redstone updates

I fricken love you skyy
When you aint watched skydoesminecraft since you were 10
He‚Äôs thanking us when he‚Äôs the guy that made our childhoods...
DID SOMEONE TURN BACK TIME OR IS LIFE GETTING GOOD???
Came from the meme,
stayed for the nistolgia
Everyone: Yes Minecraft is back!
Me: He made a Gurren Lagaan reference. Noice.
Watched technoblade beat minecraft hardcore with a steering wheel, then watched Sky say diorite was new.

You have missed the Update Aquatic-1.13, and 1.14 - The Village And Pillage Update came out a few days ago
And this is were I learned all my swear words when I was younger
"I'm afraid to come back because I'm really scared that nobody will want me back."


Damn it, man! I came here to be nostalgic, not to cry! Of course we want you back!
We love Sky, always have done, always will do!

Return of the king
Adam, I may be older (like 5 years or whatever older), I still look up to you. Sure, I don‚Äôt want to be a YouTuber anymore, but you showed me that you don‚Äôt have to be one to be successful. You‚Äôre doing music, a type of art, and I want to pursue art, inspiring me and showing me that your dreams are possible now despite what others might say.

All in all, we look up to and love you Adam. Stay strong. You‚Äôve inspired people across the world, so do what you do best and what makes you happy <3
The return of the King
I would definitely watch you again i need people to watch and concerning your heath the best way i can do is watch
Sky, axes are more powerful than swords now, but they swing slower
"See you Later Recruits." Still get chills hearing that after so long. Glad to have you back man. I'm glad you're getting help with everything and that you chose to come back. I'll always follow you Adam. I never thought I'd see you back. But it's always good to have you with us.

By the way I love your music.
Return Of The King
I remember sending Sky fan mail when I was 8, I was always trying to see if my fan mail got opened on video üòÇ
You should add a mod we‚Äôre their are toilets
It‚Äôs good to have ya back buddy. It‚Äôs been a long, long time..... :)
Sky: "Is that a Salmon?
glances over at squid
Sky: PTSD intensifies



I also love it when he looks at features that have been in the game for many years such as salmon and diorite and starts asking if they're new features.
Sky, besides the other YouTubers, you've been a longtime favorite and I'm happy to see u back.
The last time I watched Sky play Minecraft I was 12. I'm 18 now. 






How and why do I feel old...
Bro I‚Äôm so happy for you

Time to live in nostalgia
THE RETURN OF THE KING
I used to stay up late (10:00pm) on my original iPod watching ur vids, when u started doing the cops and robbers
3:56 sky sees a squid, SQUID INTENSIFIES
Just wait till he encounters phantoms for the first time

Edit: Ok WOW 238 likes that's way more than I've ever gotten on a YouTube comment before
The nostalgia tho

Edit: lol I remember this stuff for the majority of my childhood, it‚Äôs good to see you start over Adam.üëçü§ò
Adam: I quit minecraft 
Also Adam: Sky Does Minecraft Episode 1 : New World 2
I know your great in mincraft but can you beat Dandtm?
Hey sky good to see you back. This comment will probably be ignored, but here's what's been added and removed from around where you left off in the 2017-2018 range:




1.11 was the "Exploration Update", focusing on giving players more stuff to do in the overworld.

-A new villager type has been added. Cartographers help you find maps for mansions or ocean temples
-Big structures found in dark oak forests named Woodland Mansions can spawn very rarely. To find these, cartographer villagers sell maps of them as their final trades. Woodland mansions feature new mobs and rewards.
-Illagers (evil villagers) spawn in woodland mansions, and come in two forms as of now: evokers and vindicators
-Evokers are villagers that have iron axes to slash you when entering the mansion, which cripples your shield on hit.
-Vindicators are mini-bosses of the woodland mansions, and around 2-3 spawn in each. They use magic to hurt the player, spawning things like balls, spikes and Vexes. On death, they drop Totems of Undying
-Vexes are small angel things that protect Vindicators and can fly through walls
-Totems of Undying are special items which cause players to cheat death by healing and gaining extra hearts on death. It's a one use item, though
-Llamas have been added and don't really do much aside from spitting at you and holding a chest or two
-Curse enchantments have been added which give players optional challenges like not being able to take off armor or weapons, or some other stuff that I can't remember
-Shulker boxes can be crafted from stuff that drops from shulkers. They're fancy chests
-Observers are redstone machines that watch for a change and send signals based on one
-There's now more than one way to get out of end cities


1.12 was the "World of Color" update which added many decorative blocks as well as a refined crafting system.


-Parrots have been added and spawn in jungles, and can be tamed using seeds. They imitate mobs near them and fly to your shoulder sometimes.
-Concrete powder can be crafted with things like sand and gravel, and makes Concrete when it touches water. Concrete can be dyed in all the regular colors depending on the dye used to craft the powder

-Hardened clay has been renamed to Terracotta. When dying and then smelting this block it turns into Glazed Terracotta, a beautiful block that can be arranged to make many patterns. Here's some patterns to see: 
-Many small updates that add up to nice changes, try to look these up if you care

1.13 is the latest update; the "Update Aquatic" which added stuff to oceans mainly.

-Kelp is gained from oceans and I guarantee it's everywhere, it can be eaten for half a hunger bar I think

-You can now fast swim by sprinting while underwater
-Coral reefs don't do much, but they look pretty
-Dolphins have been added! They give you "Dolphin's Grace" when near them, which makes you swim much faster. If given raw cod, they lead you to treasure
-Shipwrecks have been added and have a few underwater goodies for you to grab in their chests. This may include hearts of the sea which are important
-Treasure maps can be found in shipwrecks and lead to buried treasure and can also contain goodies and hearts of the sea
-New fish mobs have been added, as you see in the water with the salmon. There's four types that you can see like that; Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish and Tropical fish
-Turtles have been added and can't be tamed, but can be bred to make baby turtles which on growing to an adult, drop scutes
-Turtle helmets can be crafted from scutes. These helmets give an infinite water breathing enchantment to players who wear it
-Sea grass spawns in oceans, and is used for breeding turtles
-A type of zombie called the Drowned now spawns; they function as regular zombies that can't drown and do more damage. Occasionally, they'll spawn with a trident, giving them a ranged attack. They can drop their trident on death
-Phantoms were voted in Minecon 2017 to be the mob added in the game out of four choices. They're flying mobs that spawn if you haven't slept for 3-7 days, swooping down to hurt you if you're exposed. They drop phantom membranes which repair Elytra wings
-Tridents can very rarely be looted from Drowneds, and do the most damage in the game. They also have enchantments like having them coming back to you when thrown, and lightning striking where they land. However, they have low durability so Mending on them is recommended
-Turtle potions can be made somehow though I don't remember how. They give slowness IV and resistance III when consumed
-Slow falling potions do what they say and can be made from phantom membranes
-Conduits are player made blocks similar to beacons in that they buff you a lot. They're made from hearts of the sea and can only be placed underwater. By putting more blocks near it in a certain fashion, they'll hurt any mob in a certain radius and can buff your swimming and mining speed as well as helping you breathe forever underwater in the radius
-Pumpkins now have to be sheared in order to get their classic face

There's a couple other stuff added in these updates that aren't as big but that's the big stuff that happened. Hopefully you read this and it's very good to have you playing MC again
Also updates have been insane, basicly a ton of new ... Everything, the ocean update changed water phisics(i know i cant spell) villiges are later getting huge updates and the games gotten alot smoother to play but a bit harder with the addition of drowned, and phantoms .
Drowned are water zombs and phantoms are creature that fly around and attack when u no sleep (basicly at night)
I haven‚Äôt seen sky acknowledge his hatred for squid in a very long time. Big rush of nostalgia right there
For me I think it's good that your joining YouTube again. I think that means that your finally ready to move on with your life (that's not supposed to be in a bad way but in a good way). You keep fighting, man.
THE RETURN OF THE KING
Looks like i can stop taking cold showers and crying at night, because fathers back
Bro you are finally back bro i watched you for years bro we love you we would never be mad og abd btw am i out of bootcamp yets?
I am so glad that I stuck around to see you recover <3 I hope to see you laugh and smile a lot like the old days. Love you so much this is so emotional.
My 11 year old self just traveled into the future to punch me in the gut. This was the biggest wave of nostalgia I‚Äôve felt in a while.

I CAN‚ÄôT TELL IF IT‚ÄôS 2009 OR 2019
YES ADAM! We love ya no matter what. Plz don't feel like anything in general is your fault. There was nothing wrong. You have so many people who still care about you. These are including your friends like who you mentioned. My childhood was built with your videos and the stuff you did with your friends. You made me happy when I was sad. When you posted stuff that felt a bit uneasy, I just wished that you would forget about what ever was bothering you and think about the best things in life. Your fans and friends/family are here for you. If you ever feel like this again don't worry, your not alone. There are so many other people who are with you and care about you. I'm looking forward to sky taking a comeback!   YOU STAY AWESOME ADAM  :) we love you! üíûü§ûüèª
Return of the king
"Where's da beef at."


Best quote yet
SkyDoesMinecraft...

That's the name I never heard in a very long time..


Good to see my childhood back!
Why are you running minecraft at a whole 2 fps
Back to the good old days.
Who's else's favorite game mode to watch from sky was cops and robbers
HOW CRAP I REMEMBER DEADLOX FROM BACK IN DE DAYYYYYY
This feels so much like an old video its about to make me cry of joy
Hey adam you should put the old ass intro back on these vids just for the nostalgia
You were a large part of my childhood dude, I love your videos
the return of the king.
sky......Youve missed EVERYTHING
I like that one video part 2 its the best vid
The combat update you missed
Adam in my eyes you still the most awesome person i know we all have misshaps but no matter what you still this community's favorite  and thank you for being awesome stick with it bro
I'm not crying, i swear.

me sitting on my death bed 
"That's is world. I'm done....
Doctor-" did you hear skydoesminecraft posted a minecraft video?" 
Me- " I AIN'T DYING YET WORLD!!!!!"
I didn't realize I wanted you to come back until it happened.
the return of the king
oh boy, what have you missed? a lot man, too much for me to write(mainly because I'm lazy)
We all think you are amazing and you should take your time to get better and to work towards having a healthier mindset
Sky:Sees squid
Me:AHHHHH
Adam I missed you so much!!! I watched you when I was literally 6 or 7 and when you stopped Minecraft and things I cried! I‚Äôm 14 now~
I missed you!
I remember watching you as a kid
Following the combat update you can no longer spam click while attacking. That‚Äôs why the squid took so many hits lol. There is a small sword icon beneath your crosshairs that recharged after a swing. 

Find an ocean. 

Good luck with your treatment!  Hope it all goes well :)
You can swim faster by tapping W twice in quick succession
Adam we love you! I watched you since cops and robbers one came out and Ive missed you! Im glad that youve came back I wish the best for you in this life. :D
Oh boy oh boy, when i saw this in my recommendation you know I started crying
Being called "recruits" again makes me smile so big :)
you can sprint in water which makes you swim
my skin? cleared.
my childhood? remembered. 

my abandonment issues? fixed.
OMG Adams back at it again my childhood it brings tears to my eyes  I really hope you get better Adam much love my dude I missed you
When you realize the video is intentionally low quality
Music didn't match the tone, but I'm excited to see you back, Sky Boy!
The king is back.

The return of the Emperor
It's update 1.14
Adam, you don‚Äôt have to fake happiness and you don‚Äôt have to fake smiles. I understand that depression can take a toll on you because I‚Äôve been there. I still am. 
You‚Äôre so calm and collected now that I actually admire it. The memories of the 4 years I watched you are coming back. You were my childhood. Thank you for introducing me to the internet.
Welcome back, Adam. We accept you with open arms.
üé∂Guess who's back,

Sky is back,

thanks reddit
Listen Adam, if you can see this, you putting up these types of videos is enough support. You making our childhoods amazing is enough support. If anything, we feel like we've been unsupportive, because a lot of people went on to different YouTubers while you still dealt with depression. But the true ones like us stayed with you. We love you, and don't ever forget that. We love you with all of our hearts, and we know you do as well ‚ù§Ô∏è


-Michael
YES YOU JUST WON BACK A OG SUB
I look back and see that my childhood is still here with me i will watch and continue support

Sky, I‚Äôve been watching you since I was 7 and now I‚Äôm 13, your videos were the highlight of my day when I was younger, I hope you get better. :)
Wow. I was being nostalgic and stumbled across a Sky video. Been a long while since I glanced this way. It's interesting to see that you're back. I really hope you're here for your enjoyment, man. It'll be cool to see your name back in my subbox. (whenever Youtube can be asked to actually fill my subbox)
Hey, Sky, I just wanted to say thank you for for everything you've done on YouTube. I started watching in middle school loved the content. I'm a senior now and I rewatch your older videos and they still make me laugh and actually kinda help when I'm down about stuff. I hope you feel better soon and that your treatment does you well.
You should bring back Bacon Man
I NEVER CLICKED SO FAST ON A VIDEO NOTIFICATION! My childhood. :3

THE BUTTER ARMY WILL RISE ONCE AGAIN!!!!
Adam: What have I missed?


Me: Kelp.
I'm bouta cry, you were my 2nd through 5th grade life

you missed a hOLE aquatic update, which was 1.13. there making a new update, basically a villagers plus thing now. uh there are textures that have been changed. i think thats the important stuff.
Low key would watch Adam stream SKYDOESMINECRAFT for hours
he... he has returned... THE KING!
You‚Äôre amazing
2011 is that you? I missed you... wait where are you going? NO COME BACK PLEASE IT WAS BETTER THEN!

Sky: Looks at Squid 2 seconds later starts having PTSD
Me:Ahhh there we go..
The king has made his incredible return.
The king returns.
Sky ur a great YouTubed and I think u should try to play forest with some people
Highkey my only complaint is how the music is done, it's kinda loud ^^
IMPORTANT THINGS YOU MISSED:
You can sprint underwater to swim now. Also, that green book in your inventory keeps track of new crafting recipes that you haven't used yet but half the items for. This way, you don't have to Google every new recipe. You also have an offhand slot that lets you put things in your left hand. You can craft a shield for it. You can also dual wield items, but you can only use them if they already have a right click action, like a bow.
 
Water physics have changed a little bit, and oceans actually have things in them now. Combat has also changed. Now, after you attack with a weapon, there's a cool down before it can be used at full strength. You can still spam click, though it will be very weak of us you let the weapon fully cool down. Sorry for the wall of text, hope this helps!
I've missed this
15 y/o me: Oh awesome a SkyDoesMinecraft video
Sky:I‚Äôm restarting the original Minecraft series.
Childhood-Self: Get the hot pockets,Mtn Dew,lock the doors and lets get this ish started.

I would prefer this series without background music and just the defualt minecraft music instead
Honestly I have been horribly depressed to. But seeing you back in the game literally makes me feel better also hope you get through depression as well man
SKY IS BACK. wait is it 2009 or?????

Great reference at the startüòÇ

Adam EVERYONE WANTS U BACK
i've missed this!!!!
We missed you Sky <3
Totally... rossome.
Are you playing vanilla minecraft?
You've missed alot
I'll gladly eat up anything you post
This was a nice surprise. I went to watch some old videos since I was feeling nostalgic and I'm greeted with this. Skies are looking bright
Yeah, its rewind time.
7:53 Gurren Lagann reference! Be the drill that will pierce the heavens!
I was 8 when I first watched sky 
I‚Äôm 16 now that‚Äôs crazy 
It‚Äôs been a long journey
Yea so here's a few immediate updates you missed!!!

Water has totally been updated, sunken ships got tons of loot and treasure maps can lead to generated structures, you can also sprint in water to swim. Water interacts with half blocks such as fences and slabs and boats are really good now too.

The Nether and Redstone are exactly the same minus the additional to one new block to each. Commands have been a bit reworked though.

New skeleton and zombie variants spawn specifically in ice, desert and ocean biomes. Also, if you don't sleep for 5 days and aren't covered by blocks, flying mobs will  attack you at night.

New stones have also been added too, though they're entirely useless and noticeable.

Among other animals, Rabbits and Llamas have been added, and sheep drop mutton now.

Combat has been completely changed too! when you hover over an attackable mob, a small hud in the shape of a sword will appear over the crosshair. When it's full, swords will do bonus + AoE damage, and Axes will do bonus damage. Axes do the most single target damage now and can easily break shields, however, swords still are the best generalist weapon. 
Connecting to that last point,  shields are super strong too, so you'll probably want one really soon. You can equip items to your off-hand by pressing F or by bringing up your inventory, so most people put their shields in there.

Tons of new decorative blocks have been added, glazed terracotta and variants of stained clay are craftable among a built in crafting book that's functionally NotEnoughItems. Also you'll love this, you can strip wood logs for a barkless version of each log, plus customizable banners have been added too. (Everything I mentioned looks really nice. Building has never been easier.)

That's everything major that you may need to encounter, The End has been received a massive face-lift, but you won't get there soon.

I'm really excited to watch this playthrough Adam. Seeing you much more grounded really feels organic and makes the connection between the viewer feel really personal, and I'm absolutely loving it!!! 
Pierce the heavens dude, kick logic to the curb and do the impossible! Just believe in the us who believe in you!
SKY LOOK UP 1.13 update
IF YOU DOUBLE TAP THE WALK FORWARD BUTTON YOU CAN SWIM FASTER AND FANCIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USE IT!!!!!!!!!!! AND ALSO SQUID WON'T HURT YOU AT ALL!!!!!!!! Love 'ya
nostalgia hits like a brick
Dude, why in the universe wouldn‚Äôt we want you back. You were our childhood. I love you, (no homo) but like holy crap. Sometimes I go back to look for your vids and I sit there sad they aren‚Äôt there. Then I saw you put them back up it and it brightened my day. I‚Äôm legit struggling to fathom how awesome this is.
Does anyone know why my feed just says video 2 and that's its waiting for the current time forever?
Sky,.please make the laugh series again....
What happened to the newer videos you uploaded?
welcome back general
You should change the version to back when you couldnt even sprint. oh boy the nostalgia
7:53 Kamina, is that you bro?
I‚Äôm crying oml
You‚Äôre doing this and I can‚Äôt even life rn
We all love your Minecraft vids btw
I MISSED U SO MUCH SKYYYYYY
The God is back the butter god is back
# Triggered by squared
SkyDoesMinecraft desperate for money Xd
Tip To Sky: They added Shields, I would suggest you use them.




Cool Features: Can block creeper/Tnt explosions, Can block arrows and stuff






Btw: spamming the sword is an outdated combat, they got an new cooldown mechanic, wait for the cooldown to complete, and use your sword to swipe at the maximum damage when the cooldown completes




Anyways Sky, Im glad your back, this should be a fun lets play
Sky Dose Minecraft,  You the first YouTuber I‚Äôve ever watched, It‚Äôs the reason I use the Name Sky In all my usernames
This message might not be seen by you sky but you have made my life the best everytime i watch your videos it makes me smile and thanks to you and alot of others have influenced me to become a youtuber or someone that can help like youve helped me and i supporte you all the way
YES YES YES YES YESSSSSSSS
Im so glad my hero is back the person i loved ived back and i hope you dont leave
I remember when my mom yelled at me for watching your videos
sky aint used to these lil boi numbers
"Comment down below what have I missed"  Uhhhhhh...oof
We love you sky would love to meet you one day. Your my idle and the reason I Stream
Dad came back from making a mixtape
I was around for the original so why shouldn‚Äôt I now.
I cried when I saw this, the memories.
It‚Äôs been a few years since I‚Äôve seen you : (
Ok Adam here's the new stuff:
-Combat takes time if you spam a sword it deals little damage if you take time it deals alot more.
-going 3 days without sleep causes a flying mob to attack you they have like 30 hp.
-Polar bears, Pandas, fish, turtles, parrots, and Dolphins are new mobs.
-Water zombies/Drowned live in water and sometimes drop Tridents that are trowable and do 9 damage.
-You need the same type of colored wool for a bed.
-You can legit swim in water if you try sprinting in water.
-New shipwrecks under water and wooded mansions.
-New antartic Biome that contains Polar bears and Igloos.
That's all I can remember, Hopefully it helps!
Edit:I'm not adding husk and stuff cause there basically regular zombies and Skeletons but retextured, meanwhile The Drowned drop Tridents.
i was smiling through this whole video
Know I know 2019 will be a good year.
The Butter King is back in Minecraft!
Just don't hug the creepers, even if they have gold.
PS: You can sprint under water, and you have a cool down on your weapons max damage, you cant spam anymore.
You put a smile on my face no matter what.
So does this mean the squid army and butter coming back ;-; 



I watched the very first Minecraft video (nostalgic)
Don't worry we all here for u
sky you have missed a lot in Minecraft.
Okay. If you dont sleep for about 3 nights Phantoms will spawn. Zombies that stay underwater will turn into "Drowneds" If you sprint in water it will start to swim. Also it looks like you dont have optifine installed. (It makes the game run faster) You should  alsi remember spam clicking your sword does less damage. You should wait for the sword to come back up. (Edit: Mojang has alsso gotten back on the update grind there are loads of snapshots coming out every week! These snapshots are for the 1.14 update. (Yes we are that far ikr) If you wish to know more about these updates check out AntVenom on youtube. (P.S Love your vids! Doesn't matter how far you were gone I'll watch it because it makes me happy.)
New trees, new doors, new beds, new food, new mobs and so much more
somethings you missed sky
-new place in the end called the End City with a few new mobs a new edible item, and a new armor piece called the elitra
-update aquatic which adds new things in the sea such as shipwrecks, new mob called the drowned, a new weapon, as well as new water mechanics such as fast swimming (works like running), some new blocks, as well as enchantments
there's also one that's comming out soon called the Village and Pillage update that adds new mobs, new looks for villager, and an awesome new weapon, as well as some more things like bambo
damn its been awhile im all grown up
I‚Äôm crying, HES BACK!
Most of the new blocks added are just decorative
You were a piece of my childhood. I'm so glad to see this. I missed you, dude, and I didn't even realize it until I saw this.

Also, there are a LOT of new things. You can swim fast by sprinting underwater, and the other day I unfortunately found out you should sleep if you want to avoid this new mob called a "phantom" I think? Because it'll swoop down from the sky and smack you. There's a bunch of other stuff too, like mansions, pirate ships, and other stuff, but this is what I know well enough to explain for now. I'll let you discover the rest yourself. It's more exciting that way, I think. :)
THE LEGEND RETURNS
3:59 Sky‚Äôs reaction to the squid brought so many happy memories of when all I did was watch YouTube, but now life‚Äôs all school, jobs, stress. Watching this brought back so much nostalgia. We‚Äôre all glad to see you make a comeback!
Im DoNe WiTh MiNeCrAfT
UP theme starts playing
Ahh skydoesminecraft is back. Boy its like 2010 again
The return of a king
There are so many new mobs and items but head this warning! AVOID THE DROWNED!!
I remember the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a moment here plane‚Äù lol. Only OG‚Äôs will remember that
So basically too many things for comments to tell you.
But, wraiths, endermen are scarer, parrots scare the heck out of you with mimicing mobs and much more
There is a combat cooldown on anything melee

In rivers there is a very common and dangerous water zombie

The little book button in your inventory thing shows you crafting recipes that you unlocked by getting certain items

Cats are now a separate mob from ocelots and are found in villages
Great seeing you back to the old Minecraft videos adam.
I missed you man
Make sure you get some sleep. Like in real life, the game gets a bit trippy if you don‚Äôt
You missed the worst update
combat update
cooldowns
axes > swords
sword (enchanted) > axes
you can SWIM
you have an ally called guardian but guardians doesnt count you as ally
ships! :3 
water temples
new mobs like husks and the stray
VINDICATORS
Invoker i mean evoker


better start off with knowing how axes work
and just grind a sword when u have enchanted table

make a base (ofc)
use AXE as a weapon till u have a diamond sword but still make a diamond axe because this will be your weapon
get enchanment table
and bookshelves

enchant books if you dont have "luck"

sharp 1 + sharp 1 = sharp 2
but heres the catch
sharp 2 + sharp 2 = sharp 3
sharp 3 + sharp 3 = sharp 4
sharp 4 + sharp 4 = sharp 5
(takes alot of exp but is a good method if you have a nether portal with efficnecy pickaxe since quartz mining is a good source of exp)

If youre rich in diamonds
it works the same using swords
sharp 4(diamond sword) + sharp 4 = sharp 5 (diamond sword)
or
sharp 4 (diamond sword) + sharp 4 (diamond sword) = sharp 5 (diamond sword)
(I'm not crazy I swear) only true fans will remember that üòÜ
Id love you to go back to your old videos with friends and playing through maps, and maybe play some mini games on servers
Minecraft is back! First the Crewcraft started up again and now Sky, my childhood is coming back
Do whatever makes you happy and if minecraft makes you happy then get ready for our tears of nostalgia
Omg sky is back. I just recently started playing again too, so there is so much nostalgia now.
Once he listed off everyone thats been their for him such as Deadlox (i lowkey forgot how to spell his name sorry)  i actually started crying and screaming "the memories" its 3 am. My parents are asleep in the room next to me..
My childhood has been reborn. I need to cry
1.start a realms
2.put this world on it
3.get back with deadlox and Jason 
4.create this series
5.after that do some adventure maps
6.officially bring back the old days. 
And I already looked past the bad version of yourself but I‚Äôd just like to see you get some nice friends who would support you as much as I wish I could x
Love ya Sky I can‚Äôt wait for part 2 and I can‚Äôt wait for you to continue
Yeeeesss he back hell yeah
Oh hey my childhood is back, how‚Äôve you been old friend

He's back.
4:25
So what'd I miss? What did I miss? 
Minecraft my sweet sweet home I wanna-

I'm not crying... you are
I've never been this happy before
We're always here for ya cause all your subscribers got your back!
I actually cried watching this
hearing Adams voice, doing minecraft, literally brings back my Childhood. i'm 15 and i've been watching for so long, we've missed you sky, welcome back :) <3
My man I love you don‚Äôt ever apologize you are our worlds and I love you so much thank you for years of enjoyment
Holy crap I remember sitting in my bed when I was like 9 watching your videos I was a sky does Minecraft addict I would watch your videos over and over thank you for this video
Now I want to go play Minecraft again

Can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm mad though
WE LOVE SKY
Dude so much has changed bro!

-you can swim better/faster if you run in the water
-now there are polar bears, parrots, dolphins, fish, and other mobs
-now you can find shipwrecks, coral reefs, and treasure underwater
-there are mansions now with new mobs and items
-recipe book lets you craft more efficiently
-if you don't sleep a mob will come and attack you (forgot what its called)
-tons of textures have changed
-and so much more that I can't think of right now

Not to mention that there's a new update that will add so many more things
I'm gonna cry, 10 year old me is quaking
I used to be a Mineplex admin
its ok Sky we love you <3
Lol Diorite became a thing in minecraft so long ago, dang Adam has it been that long?

Well there's a flying mob that attacks you if you don't sleep

There's wings that makes you glide, but you can fly with them by using fireworks

There's shields, pretty easy to make

Minecraft has a different fighting mechanism that makes it to where you can't spam, you have to wait for it to charge up and then attack for more damage. (Most important thing to know)

Pandas are a thing

There's crossbows, idk if they're in pc yet, but just know that crossbows are a thing and they are awesome.

There is so much you missed man, go look in the minecraft wiki or forums
Plz 1 do not laugh with the rosom sqaud
Your character has swim animations now, there's pandas too apparently
Teamcrafted back please
1:50 Let me just stop you right there, Adam. I've been watching you since middle school and I'm a sophomore in college now. You are the f*cking best, to put it mildly. I connected with you not because I expected you to be a "YouTuber", an image that you may have felt pressured to take up; I connected with you because you just loved having fun with your friends and growing as an individual and as a member of your social group through the incredibly dynamic and diverse sphere of influence that is video games. And of course, as you now explore your individuality through music, I'm still right here with you and I try to listen to everything you put out. Nobody is the best 'body there ever was!


Don't worry about what people expect of you, especially when those expectations are of days long gone. You should never be afraid to revisit old memories, of course, but always remember that the only way through life is FORWARD, period. Stay you, my guy. I'll always show you love and respect!
Plz do the modded cops n robbers series again
I hope sky keeps this up. I remember him from way back in the beginning. I'm so glad he's back. I missed him and like always. I accept him and support him. Welcome back sky.!!!!
Who else  was actually here  for his original series ?
WE LOVE SKY!!!
WHY WAS I NOT TOLD HE IS BACK???
Please make series <3
I'm literally crying and shaking rn, you would never






Be not awesome sky
I'm not sure where to post art for you tbh XD I wanted to draw just normal fan art for the longest time and I don't know where to post it at xD
My child self is screaming of joy- and my 16 y/o self is now continuing to watch Adam‚Äôs videos as if it hasn‚Äôt been years. I‚Äôve never been happier to see another YouTuber come back. üíñ
I forgot ur voice and hearing ur voice doesnt ring a bell
Disappointed you are subscribed to t-series
Hey you should do that lava island again with Ross and deadlox
I shed a tear of happiness when I heard "I'll see you later recruits." been a recruit since way back in the day. It feels good to hear that again.
I like how the thumbnail is similar to the 2011 one
oh my god he‚Äôs back
Adam I‚Äôm glad your back your my childhood and your awesome man!The depression thing I understand I have severe depression and its hard.just know the sky army is here for you and we love you for you!nothing will change that ‚ù§Ô∏è
You have to time your Sword strikes now
You missed fish,  coral,  shipwrecks,  vex's, Vindicators,  tridents,  sea turtles,  dolphins,  and 1.14 coming soon,  etc
What do you MEAN? This is what all of us have wanted! I‚Äôve been wanting a reason to relive these years. This is beautiful not gonna lie.
So nice to see sky back I remember the time I subscribe when sky was at 2 mil feels like the old days are coming back for another round
You should have titled the video "Minecraft nostalgia"
Please Adam "I dOnT tHiNk YoU wIlL wAnT mE bAcK." are you kidding I can remember back when, and still to this day how I look forwards to your insane exploits and everything. I was there when yall played the first epic jump map (I remember the squid moon). That year was tough for everyone, you had your thing that happened, Ian had an issue of his own (he's Christian now, and married and he went to Jeruselum with his wife for passover), everyone had a really bad time then, but they all rebounded, I''m glad you're back. You don't need to worry about all of that crap about not being wanted or anything, I'm glad your back, and I welcome you with open arms, but remember  also mobs you should know about
Strays (recolored zombies)
some recolored skeletons
zombies can detect you from an extreme distance
fish exist, you can catch them with buckets and have an aquarium

Pillagers (villagers that like to fight you)
Pillager beast (the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, they also like to fight you)
ocean temples (look out for the self-propelled limpit bombs)
magma (dont step on it, stay away if its underwater)
items float now, unless they dont, magma sucks them down when its underwater
theres buried treasuremaps
shipwrecks
drowned (underwater zambies)
heckin drowned villages
possibly more, I dont remember.
and yes creepers are still that bad.
bruh it‚Äôs been so long since i played Minecraft (stopped playing round the time i stopped watching u, so about three yrs ago) so now that ur uploading these guess we‚Äôre gonna relearn the rules of Minecraft together üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
We missed you
I don't even play Minecraft anymore but he was my childhood
I use to binge watch your videos when i was a kid cause they were so so so entertaining. Thanks for coming back really looking forward to your other videos coming up soon.
WOAH WOAH WOAH, HOW LONG WAS THIS A THING???????
No one will get tired of you ever :3 also u have missed everything.
Thank you for coming back again sky.....
OH SHI--



Nostalgia is Flooding My Mind AGAIN!
Been here since 100k, keep up the great content  :)
It's been so long, damn... the nostalgia hits hard when it comes to Minecraft.

Get well soon, with that treatment. Depression is a serious thing. So, get well soon.
Why is your minecraft at low quality????
Bro your awesome
I will always watch you. Also, the nostalgia from him seeing the squid
The first house you make better be called skyhub
I hope u get through it man
Gosh I'm so happy.
Honestly, I miss the old days of Minecraft, and I think they will never come back. But I think about it like this:
Beforehand, you were exciting and crazy. But that was Skyz, not the depressed Adam.
I'm happier with this tame Skyz, because it means that Adam is getting the help he needs. 
I've been with both of these characters since I ever got YouTube before, and seeing this just made me giddy. Not only is my favorite YouTuber grtting better, he's also returning to the roots of minecraft, the simpler days.
Adam, remember to think about all of us and yourself equally. Make sure you get the help you deserve.
6:39 ‚ÄúYou thought my name would be something else but it was me, DIO(rite)!‚Äù
omg i love you i ws so young when i used to watch you

Killing the squid was funny, i do miss you doing a voice for the squid, that always cracked me up

This.. this is beautiful. Magestic. Nostalgic. It will be nice to grow up with you again.
Some tips: Watch for phantoms. I have been requested to not tell you how to avoid them, so yeah... Press ctrl while swimming to swim faster. 1.9 pvp has a cool down while fighting. Press the green book for crafting recipes. Can't really think of anything rn, but there there are there are more things. Good Luck!
FINALLY my childhood
im so happy your getting the help you need, i hope you have the best of luck in all your future endeavors, youve changed my life and made me a much happier person and i hope that you can get affected in the same way youve affected me.

Honestly, your update video gave me the confidence to reach out for help. I've been struggling with a lot of problems which I denied having for years now, but when you posted that video I thought: If he can do it, then so should I. You've helped me so much throughout the years and now you did it again. 
We'll always be here to support you no matter what so don't worry about us not wanting you back. 
Because we would gladly have you back!

When he was attacking the squid I was tearing up damn
That like to dislike ratio tells you how much people love you Adam
My childhood has been resurrected
Man , the nostalgia , I used to watch you play jail break with your friends when I was younger and I would laugh so hard as you were getting chased around.

( EDIT ) : Oops , it was actually called Cops & Robbers not jail break.
you da the best sky
glad he is playing minecraft and not fortnite
1.13. aquatic update. All kinds of ocean animals, water zombies, they added a trident weapon that is dropped by the water zombies, there are sunken ships in the ocean with loot in them, and all kinds of other stuff. There's also all kinds of new monsters, the scariest being a flying pterodactyl looking thing, there's an enchanted mansion in a random place usually miles away from spawn, basically Minecraft's a different game.
Sky your gonna make me cry and you're taking me back to 2010/2011
Use the same microphone it's very nostalgic and I love it lmaoo

I have sudden flashbacks to Sky's original base
I used to binge your cops and robbers series
Sky. It's been a while. I watched you at the age of 7-12. I'm 15 now. Thank you for the memories and everything. It's amazing to have you back.

Hey, Sky. I doubt you‚Äôll ever read this (love to hear if you do). You were one of my favorite YouTubers out there and helped me get through some rough times in middle school. I‚Äôm in college now, and I missed you so much. I will keep up with this series and as an art major I will be sending you my fanart. Glad you‚Äôre back, and as a long time recruit of the Sky Army I can say from the bottom of my heart, we‚Äôre here for you, all of us!
Honestly I would like it if you continue this series. Just hearing you ramble is enough for me to be happy hearing you again
3:54 . THOSE DAMN SQUIDS
The nostalgia
You need to time your hits in combat now
Chicken?
You can swim now, it's like sprinting in the water
LOOK AT THE CHICKEN

SKY I AM SO GLAD YOUR BACK you have no idea how much I would watch and re watch your videos, I would come home almost crying and watch your videos to make me happy. EVERY SINGLE DAY. I stayed up all night just to watch and re watch your video's You've made me so happy and when you left my heart DROPPED. Today I was feeling epacially bad/sad and I thought I'd re watch one of your try not to laugh video's to make me feel better.... Ii had no Idea you've been  back for FOUR MONTHS. I grew up watching you for at least 2 years. Ii hope your make more videos. Your the only reason I don't feel bad all the time. I have NO IDEA what I would do with out you, thanks for coming back. <3
Learn how to swing first bro
So guys we did it dad finally got the milk after 2 years
Hes lossing the will to live
I‚Äôm actually really happy this has adds
and i hope you get through your deppression
Stay determined
Hey sky I have a question. Sorry if this is like a touchy subject. But do you still talk with like Jess, Max, and Ross? Like everyone at the office.
‚ÄúComment down below what i missed ‚Äú ... youve missed alot dude ... like a hella lot ... sea monsters , new ores , shields, you can even fly with wings ... havent played in years but i still read the new things on mojangüòÇ
PANDAS ARE IN
You can sprint un water
Last time you played was 1.6, right?

The biggest things mechanically past that point, without looking anything up would probably be
*you can hold down left ctrl to sprint
*the Dark forest biome and the Illager mansion + bosses inside
*the guardian temple at the bottom of the ocean 
*modifications to the biome setup so theres like 40 variations instead of ten
*the End has ended villages and ships and a flying-Cape thing called the elytra
*I think theres polar bears now?
*and theres gonna be cats and pandas in the next update
*and theres parrots in the jungles now
*Villagers have gotten a few upgrades, it's way easier to tell which ones which now
Plus some other stuff I cant remember atm.
he's back. But where's the Budder?
Crys I DONT SEE MINECRAFT THE SAME
You should do a Minecraft TreasureWars series. Fill in for Vikkstar and Lanchlan, it would be amazing.
deja vu I have been in this place before
I was an Orphan til you came back.
We missed u:)
There is one song that I love it is new word
Yo man I‚Äôve watched all of the Sky channels since they came out and I am super excited they‚Äôre back. I‚Äôve missed them so much
It feels like Sky is a much more entertaining commentator now than he was all those years ago at the height of his popularity! I really wish he'd just have a series like this where he just plays survival and talks about whatever he wants.
You missed: looms A BUNCH OF MODS tridernts swimming  swimming zombies and more blocks
Hold up
Legit childhood right here
Team Crafted Reunion 2?

Maybe?

Found out you're doing Minecraft again from a video AntVenom made. I am now preparing for nostalgia.
Tridants water sombies
Hey Sky. I've been watching your videos for years and years. I'm so happy that you're not only back to Minecraft, but also that you're getting help for your depression. We're all here for you.

I literally just watched you and pewdiepie back in the golden days. I remember being in 4th grade and discovering you and gosh I‚Äôm 16 now. It‚Äôs been a ride. Also for an English project in 4th grade I unintentionally made a fan fiction about being a recruit. Pretty epic but hey, those were the good days
my childhood is back you better play more cops and robbers that was my favourite
Goin in fresh NNNoo your goin in blind with a path that‚Äôs surrounded by legos
Bro, if you could start doing Minecraft mod reviews again it would mean the the world to me, 3 particular ones I remember you doing is the ice cream creeper sandwich mod, the slender man mod and the giant creeper mod i think it was, I remember watching you when I was like 10 and i would come home from school just to watch your videos, I'm 16 now and am really happy that you're back on YouTube. 
Much love from South Africa
:')
I hope the people who dislikes this get dysentery
Ran out of money?

WE LOVE SKY
OMG who remembers team crafted ! Please do jailbreak videos again. I miss these minecraft videos

My childhoodüò≠üò≠
We Love Sky
Long time, no see old friend.
Yeah it‚Äôs a new update 1.13
The aquatic update
There‚Äôs a bunch things
-sprint in water to swim (quickly)
-there‚Äôs live salmon, cod, pufferfish, tropical fish, turtles, dolphins
-sunken villages with drowns (drowned zombies), shipwrecks spawn in the ocean
-kelp, seapickles, seagrass grow underwater
I remember watching sky when I was 8 years old. Innocent times. Coming home from school and immediately running to my computer to see the latest video. Once I started highschool I stopped watching him. Now that I'm back, now that you're back, I'm so happy that you're here. Thank you for giving me one of the best childhood memories I've had that will stick with me throughout life. Love you, Adam
We need another  butter song... I used to blare it in my brothers room and I need a new one to annoy him with
1.13 the ocean is all improved with a lot of new things, sea grass, coral, turtles, fish, new enemies, and new weapons, utilities, and armor
As a kid, you were easily my favorite youtuber. You really were there for so many people and were a big part of so many childhoods. I nearly cried when I heard you were doing these videos again. You made me laugh, and you made me happy. Don't doubt that we don't want you back. From all the kids who's lives you brought joy into: thank you.
I‚Äôm just crying my eyes out i missed him so much ü•∫üò≠
3:05 the old sky is back
Papa sky is back!!!
It didn‚Äôt feel the same, i miss the 240p lets play video
I am unworthy of this
Years later and I'm still cheering like a little kid when Sky killed that squid.
WE LOVE SKY
Oh my god......the rumors are true..
Next thing to do is the mod showcases. Do them for the new people who just got into Minecraft.
If he can get on the hermitcraft server that whold be amazing.Like on vid a week and its perfect. Hopefully that will happen but who knows.
What you have missed:
Aquatic update: bunch of fish, underwater things that have water zombie guys that also have chests, sunken ships that have chests that sometimes have treasure maps that lead to treasure, turtles, dolphins, trident.
Village and Pillage: better villages, and these monsters that will attack the villages and the player, cats are a specified mob now.
Etc.: polar bears, these things that will fly through the air and attack you if you haven't slept in a while, a bunch of new blocks.
I'm sure I have missed a million different things but this is all I remember.
God I was gone for a few years, and I came back to this? My God.
Do cops and robbers lol
Play on callmecarsons server
Yessssssssss
On the very very off chance of you seeing this I would like to ask a question. have you planned on making the SkyVsGaming videos public again? you may have talked about this in the past, and if you have I haven't seen it. Many people miss the Gta and GMod videos. If you don't want them public for a personal reason, I understand, but if you have no problem with bringing them back or making a archive then I know many people will appreciate that.
happiness noises
Hours of childhood memories are flooding back.
YES YES YES IM PEEING





Also I hope you get better
Who else has been watching him your whole life basically?
I love this
What update are you on?
Memories


Btw Minecraft does cure depression
3:47 PRAISE THE SUN!!! i didn't know sky played dark souls :o
Oh sky I have a video suggestion for you how about you watch 2 invader zim episodes watch invader zim dark harvest and a spooky Halloween one you'll love it haha üòÅüëç
Here's 1.13 summed up for you:
Dolphins, turtles, visible fish, kelp, sprinting in water makes you swim, phantoms that spawn if you don't sleep for too long, underwater zombies, tridents, spam clicking does less damage, blocks that pull you above or under water (soul sand and magma blocks), and concrete.
There's other things too, I just can't remember them :'>
Sprinting in water will make you swim
2019 is better now
Look kiddo, if you don't put up your old server I might just die because it'd be so nostalgic if you did.
Sky I hope you do cops n robber and try not to laugh again ;w;
My child hood is back
You are the best ever and still want to see you in cops and robers and sky block and so on hope you get better
I feel like he's just doing this because people are telling him too it doesn't really feel the same
I don't know sky, I think I want you to get confused by these crazy updates
Welcome back dad üò¢
You could have just killed some sheep and made a bed
When I was little used to watch you daily on my moms phone and I got in trouble from the swearing xd
Thank you!
When Sky attacked that squid, I felt 12 again
Collab with callmecarson
Nostalgia at its finest..

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks...
Minecraft makes a comeback as Sky makes a comeback, coincidence I THINK NOT
The aquatic update, polar bears, parrots, I know this video now came out before the newest update where there are lots more cats as well, and there are new blocks since youve left, there are also pandas and bamboos. Writing in books looks different, and other things that I've yet to discover.
Though if you're on java minecraft I don't really know, that might be the same but I did all of the windows 10 version updates lol
You have missed a whole heck of a lot. You should go in creative one day and look at all the new stuff but you don't have to üôÇ
ME IN PAST WERE AM I?
WERE IS BUTTER?
WERE IS HOME?
An era is reborn
True OG's will remember squids
Ruuuun it's a squid!!!
All hail Minecraft Renaissance of 2019. The kids are all playing Fortnite and Apex, Minecraft is lit again
Pillagers... Watch out

Wait a minute didn‚Äôt he say he wanted to stop Minecraft?

Well I hope it makes you happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

You can sprint in water to make you go faster and it has a swimming animation
My childhood. This is so wholesome
Run in water and you can swim
This is like SwaggerSouls went pg-13 lmao
Yes minecraft is back
You seemed so depressed plz be less depressed where‚Äôs that happy sky
The last time I watched him was a Minecraft video back in 2010. I was 4. Even though I was young this still gives me nostalgia.
Thank you.
More monsters
Ooo cops and robbers and do not laugh also Adam spitting fire
No more new vids?
oh you missed so much with minecraft uptades and SO DID I

there are drowned mobs, pirate ships, evil night birds, underwater villages?? new biome villages, and lots more
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gasped so loud when sky said he wasn‚Äôt sure if we wanted him back. I don‚Äôt know about  everyone else but I‚Äôve been waiting for this since he stopped. üò≠ my favorite Minecrafter that got me addicted to mc is back and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been happierüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
You missed TOO MANY updates.Anyways,sorry for being late.I'm too busy to even touch my phone.Well anyways,welcome back sky
The king has returned

Also, can I just say that this feels so much like a childhood reboot coming back? I'm about to graduate college, and wow does this help me again like it did in high school. Thank you so much for bringing this back, and I can't wait for you to explore how everything has changed and updated in Minecraft.
Good luck hope you get the treatment ya need

You can‚Äôt spam click attack mobs now, you wait for the sword in the middle of the screen
Adam you can't spam click anymore you have to click then wait 3 seconds to click again for Max damage other wise a diamond sword could basically be hitting something with your fist
Budder is pretty darn üî•

Sky you should put your old music in the background of your old videos in the background of your videos.
Uhh what
I hope I see ross in future episodes!
Ah nostalgia, it‚Äôs tastes like butter
Hiiiiiiiiiii
Yeah
yes
Hi sky
firstttt
It‚Äôs ty
yes the real content is back
Adam add the squids don‚Äôt you remember them
One thing that has changed while you‚Äôve been gone is the combat. Spamming the sword like you did now does not work as well as waiting to strike when the little sword on your screen in the middle has filled back up
What happened to ross
Childhood entered the chat
<3
Hey Sky do you not playing UHC UltraHardCore with somebody YouTuber in Minecraft.
OMG
BUDDER
When he started playing minecraft again? Want views more than thats understandable!
yeet
Oh wait you started doing minecraft again? Awesome, if you dont mind me asking what made you wanna do it?
AWESOME VIDEO! Have a good day!
sky or Adam whichever you prefer are you still gonna play with all the other people you did youtube with live ross mithzan or even thatguybarney
BUTTAH!

SKY, LOX MA CHILDHOOD BOI
My childhood
Sky has been one of my favorite YouTubers for years and now that I go back and look I‚Äôve been watching him for over 8 years and his humor and everything has helped me get through a lot and helped me take my mind off things when I couldn‚Äôt deal with it, I don‚Äôt know how I could convey how much he‚Äôs really helped me but I‚Äôm just one person with the same story as many but still he‚Äôll always have a place in my heart and I hope he takes his time and gets in a better mind set <3
Sky
Omfg I thought u weren't a stupid 2 year old on Minecraft but you once again are
Budderrrrrrr
Firstttt
Talk with Husky and make him explain y he left.
Miss the old days of cops and robbers. The old gang should get back together and make a vid on it
1st
I know there's only 11 but why dislike this?
Minecraft yeah Minecraaaaaaffffftttt
hi
Hey sky just wondering if ur ever gonna bring back skyvsgameing if u don‚Äôt want can u at least put the old videos I like to watch them because I find them really funny especially the bowling one
The hulk movie we deserve.

Sky play minecraft with jerome
Already clickingbaiting, YOUR A TOUTUBER AGAIN???!!
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm enjoying watching Minecraft again
Great video.
Yay!!! Sky is playing Minecraft. Childhood is back!
YEY
You can't spam hit anymore,  that sword under your indicator is your charge
It‚Äôs sad because the joy has left his voice
Wait a minute didn't you say that you were not going to make any videos for three weeks because of your depression?
2nd
Where‚Äôs Rosssss
First
Of all places why did the Hulk come here instead of Infinity War when Banner needed him most??
budder
Omg he‚Äôs back I‚Äôm so happy
Oof
Swallowing children is always fun
Why are you playing Minecraft man? You are totally faking being happy. Do what you want, not what the kids want.
Oof
GO BACK TO HATING SQUIDS
You can't spam the attacks anymore
Sky return to Minecraft Suicide rate dropped to 0%
Too bad i got first
Hulk is a thicky
WHERES THE SKY VS GAMING ARCHIVE, YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ONE IN YOUR LAST MESSAGE VIDEO 6 MONTHS AGO?!?????!!?!??!!
Now I‚Äôm in the mood to make a world just to fill it with squids so I can blow it up
I‚Äôd still love to be able to meet up with sky, went to mine on 2015 just to find out he wasn‚Äôt going and then never had opportunities
Adam sounds human this episode and not like a a cancer patient
Hulk angry
It‚Äôs rewind time
Aww! It‚Äôs so nice to see the YouTuber who created my childhood to be back! Thank you Adam! I missed the old videos so much!!
Tbh sky and deadlox u are crazy awesome üòÇ not even doing this to suck up or get attention.  I don‚Äôt even know if you are going to read this but if you do just read.üòÅ know u r awesome!
Sky I genuinely request you get into contact with Jess,Barney,Ross, Mudkip and red if you haven‚Äôt already. Regardless please get better I know depression is hard to go through,I myself went through depression for 3 years of my life, and I‚Äôm 13. Get well soon mate I‚Äôm looking forward to you picking the pieces of your self back up and getting back out there...-the_original
Hello childhood I‚Äôve missed you
Who is better pewdiepie or t series
Man it‚Äôs like i went back six years god all i need is tobuscus to become relevant again not by keemstar and i will actually cry
Q
Suggestion: You should maybe do videos on other games besides Fortnite and Minecraft because there are lots of games out there that are better than them. For example, Super Smash Bros is very popular but youtubers don‚Äôt get that many views because it is mostly competative gaming. Just focus on Comedy and a variety of games and you should be fine. Have a great Day!üëç
