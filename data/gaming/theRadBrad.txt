This game so cool!  Like Narnia but poor weapon,  I will watch it until ending dude

I love your vids and you're the only game play youtuber I watch.keep up the amazing work and Please do an update on rage 2!!!!!
I Am Very Loving Your Series! Please Make It A Bit Longer!!!
I was totally about to go to sleep when I saw this video pop up and was like:

HEEEEEEYYYYYY, BUDDY! HOW CONVENIENT!
You don't sleep 😂😂😂

But anyway good work finally
Hey brad I've been watching your vids 7 years I first found your channel looking for a skyrim play through
Seeing this series pop up is the highlight of my day. Your reactions are hilarious xD
You know? Maybe you are not the best gamer ever, but definitely your walkthrough videos are the most enjoyable videos on youtube ❤️
Brad at every video : "this game is really new to me, it popped out of..." 
WE KNOW ! And we still love you !  XD
"Yes, but you're a thief. He's a king"

"And what's the difference?"


Never thought a single dialogue from a game made me awoke all night..
My main Character keeps running slow with slight pause while sprinting
Loving walkthrough Brad! Keep the uploads coming 👍
The only gameplay commentary on Youtube that doesn't annoy but rather makes the gameplay more interesting to watch.
Love xx
Come on Rady Booooy take this series to the end quick as we all love you buddy!!!! xDDD
I binged watched this while cleaning house!  What a great game!  Thanks for bringing it to us Rad.   Keep them coming, please.
thanks for playing brad, this game is very enjoyable!
Uploading so slow man I am Off. 

I mean i am liking Videos but.
Just finished this game. Can someone recommend more games like this? This game is a masterpiece.
May you please upload more from this series?
Great Game and great Player    
And

1 Million views will Coming In Next 1 hour or 2
Brad you should call this The "How Convenient" Game with all of the materials there for every situation lol.
It is a wonderful game, but you take to long to upload the game videos.
Please stop Days Gone and focus on this one because it's so much better.
All the best man.
Waiting for these parts like you wouldn't believe.. Much love Brad!
Subscribed cause I love your gameplay. I was so curious about this game and I love it! Thanks for playing dude
thank you so much brad for updating it I will support this series by liking it
I'm in love with this game. Just different!  I hope the story continues to be compelling. Love your game, Brad. I would warm up Hugos bottom if he didn't start listening.
Who else ik is waiting for part 7
it would be amazing if u treated this series like days gone!!
Another great walkthrough by Brad




HOW CONVENIENT
Is it me or you actually said "Plague Tell" instead of "Plague Tale". Keep up the good work. A million thanks for allowing me to enjoy these games as I can not play them.
Thanks for the new episode Brad! keep it up :D
another video. great!!!! continue with the good work brad❤
Quality content .. Been waiting for hours! Nice seeing u grind more rad!
Please tell me everyone can see that thing on hugos neck at 7:55
To be honest,I think I'd be bored playing this game,but I do enjoy watching you play it.
I'm not very good at games,love playing them,but I'm hopeless!!!
"When I want something I take is, I don't declare it"
"You're a thief he's a king."
"What's the difference?
You know that I can't argue with that logic.
I have been with you since heavy rain, i usually dont watch people playing games but ur voice relax me hehe
Keep doing what you love the most!!
In time,they will get to kings castle ?
Bro radbrad just wanna tell you why haven’t I seen your face yet, did you show your face before? Well your on the 5 person in my top 5 person I wanna meet you were sixth, but because I love your videos and because my top person I wanted to meet died (Stanley) 😭 from marvel your now my fifth plz show your face or did you already if u did plz show me the video, thx.
Haha.  The soldiers clearly have no peripheral vision.  How nice!
Brad you post this series more? I'm really enjoying the storyline. Atleast 2 or 3 vids a day would be enough
Aya y'all need to push the like button so he can finish this 😐
I'm so sorry that I betrayed you by watching the rest (nearly) from the other youtubers. But I still watch yours as I really like your gameplay
This game is really good watching you play it makes me wanna play it looks so fun 😍
this has got to be the sleeper hit of 2019.  they haven't carried it near us yet for Xbox1.  this mission was stealthy to be sure.
"so guys" best line XD but you still the best streamer
I would’ve upgrade my sling shot for Boss battles and enemies. Stealth is already good.
OmG that was amazing !!!! Super exited for the next part.
I've litterly waited all day 4 this vid finally by the way Brad I love this series👌👍
"We need to get to the acky-🦆." 
Now isn't that the cutest thing ever...😊
Hey thanks for the uploads I never have time to play but I play vicariously through you lol
Man this game is getting better and better. Can't wait to see end :D although I wonder where is the vampires that talked about very beginning of the game :D again great vid Brad thanks in advance
Ditch the screaming, Muselk sounds just like you.
RadBrad is smart for making videos ahead of time but make it private so there is more content every day!😁
She must be in Olympics...she throws so accurate
Aiy we definitely want part 7 and more keep posting it and we will keep supporting u✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
I cant rest!!make video fast and i love you video!<3
Love you videos brad. Keep up the good work
Broooo is so beautifull your gameplay
A Canadian fan politely thanks you, and hopes for the entire game to come a soon as possible.
I bet Innocence is hinting at Hugo, his remarks always make me smile, what a lovely little guy.
looked for a playthrough because I couldn't play the game myself (I get too stressed out by being chased so I had to give up rather quickly) and found you, and now I also follow you. Thanks, already excited for next part!
I'm liking this game! Really like a strong story AND puzzles in a game. This has both! 😊
But tbh...I feel a little butt hurt (jk) that u dried days gone up on us! THAT story hasn't ended-  clearly- so if we only getting one 20 vid a day now, can it at least be 30 min? Or an hr of missions and clearing out freakers...please?
I used to be an addict so cold turkey isn't working for me now! 😂lol
I have just watched all of your videos on this in a row!  I’m loving this and I’m enjoying watching you play it!
Notice how he saids “ so guys” at the start of every intro
“The ackyduck”

These rats remind me if some places in Manhattan! You see rats crossing the streets and patrolling the sidewalks.
Keep Hugo in the grass until the coast is clear! I bet he slows you down.
It's more interesting when you talk Brad it's just like we play that game together
Loving the series Brad. Keep it up!
Its near the ending

HOW CONVENIENT
Keep it Up Brad.....
where are the rage 2 videos??? not uploading that anymkre?
What makes me interested in playing a game: Action, Thrill, Puzzles, the Eye Candy CGI
What makes me Watch RadBrad: Is he going to pick up that stuff over there O_o, WHERE IS HE GOING :O, Dude he is over there OMG Look at HIM shaking my screen
 - Yup, you are one interesting sucker. How convenient.
I was constantly checking the time on the video because I didn’t want it to end 😫
Great video, but it would be awesome to see a couple Days Gone videos everyday also... i know i would watch horde videos, or the Nero storylines, or any of the remaining storylines just to watch more of that game. Of course if it's not too much trouble I know it's a lot of work
This game is way better than rage 2. i waited and bash my keyboard everytime you update rage 2 instead of this :(
I am really enjoying the series. Thank you
this is just another walking simulator with a lot of hiding and a Somewhat good story SMH so glad i got this for free and not pay $44.
Found your channel when you played saints row 3
I just killed all those dudes, simple, quick and easy.
More brad plss 2 videos a day brad 1 video per day doesnt suffice
Hit like if ur waiting for the next part!😉
13:20 homeboy rocking that old school Kane walk from the attitude era lol
13:20 homeboy rocking that old school Kane walk from the attitude era lol
Hey brad, do more plague tale please, love you👍
I love this game! Please keep updating!!
One thing about this game, the little kid is a bit of a pain in the arse :) always slowing you down
Theradbrad I came here to take over your house because your intro was infested with RATX
Awesome great content thank you can't wait to see what's next
this game is kinda giving off fable three vibes.
Brad please make the duration a lot of number like 40 duration
Your electricity bill should be 1$.
VALOIS CHILDREN! This game! Seriously this game goes the extra mile so beautifully! They could have left the date obscure or not placed it in real history at all but that little word choice gives volumes of context from real historical events.

The Valois name defined a notorious branch of French Royalty whose lack of heir is credited as a big cause of the 100 year war between France and England.  This explains so much but specifically too why English soldiers would so willingly assist the hunt. They labelled them simply as children of the reigning royals in a war of succession (boiling it to simplest terms). Cool detail!
Hey U should post twice a day
Rage 2? This game is cool but I wanna see the rage 2 game play
keep it going, Brad. Finish please!!!!
Man, they whisper so loudly.
I looooooove the gameplay, hope to see more!!
are you not in immersive mode? the only people that plays this game in standard mode, must not be good at games like these.
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO DROP GREAT VID
Very cool Loving this thanks dude,heeheee.
Good work Brad...  dude this is fascinating..
Yeeeeeea man! Keep up the good work. :D
I feel like this game got some Easter eggs to it🥚🥚🤔
About time been waiting all day🔥
I love these series! Keep it up!
Melie lowkey flirting with Amicia tho...
please continue with this awesome game!!!
Cant you play this more this  Awesome!
This game is lit can not wait to see more.
Keep doing it 
You are one awesome gamer
only episode with no rats
Hi Brad i can't understand about the game
Keep up the good work Brad. Likes everything you do such as quick and steady uploads on games, and I don't mind your voice and agrees with the comment thread with @vessi. The only thing that I hate about your videos that I have one 80% of the games you play are your game sense and tend to rush things a bit. Just take it slow for a game like these. I keep yelling in my mind when you waste resources or when you rush thing that you left/forgot the resources behind you. Overall Good work.
Hey can you please play Generation Zero. It is a post apocalyptic robot survival(ish) game set in Sweden 1980s I don't mind even if it is just one video but can you please consider playing it as I would absolutely love to see you playing it
Emelie and Amicia are voiced by one voice actress i feel like....
Right on!! This is awesome
About to sleep ~> saw this ~> oh boy
We would appreciate more parts thanks
Thanks brad please finish this game an please finish Sekiro

I love your videos Brad,theyre smooth loud and clear.When there's a walkthrough that I want to watch,you are the man.Today I was at work thinking all day "i can't wait to get home to watch part 6". Now,i know that there are many other channels with even the whole game done,but I stay loyal,i rather wait and live the moment one day at the time cause I know it will be a good time. gg man
The characters' accents are so beautiful
The game is too much of stealth and it’s boring. So I’m just skipping it
Keep the coming bro! 👍

the ackyduck!
This game reminds me of a polish legend about Prince Popiel with his wife (which i don't remeber the name :P ) where they poisoned their relatives at dinner and threw them in the lake then rats started coming out of their bodies to get their revenge on them. They escaped on the boat to the tower which was at island in the middle of the lake Gopło. They thought that rats can't get them through the lake but they did and they ate the bottom of a boat Prince and princess swam on to unable them to escape. They were eaten alive and thus from that tale now the tower is called a mouse tower ( If i got it wrong at some point sorry and for grammar mistakes xD) Really glad Brad is going to finish it :D

Brad have you meet redjellyfish1234 send message if you have
I don't really like zombie games but this game has me hooked idk why
A Brad video, and I just awoke.


How Convenient
Hey Brad! This is the best series!! Keep up the amazing work!!
13:32 BRAD: gets shot at
also BRAD: maybe I can throw rocks at em?
lmao
Just warmed up my lunch and sat down to watch Rage and notification for Days Gone. HOW CONVENIENT! Love this game and your content Brad!
Hey Brad , I completed the NERO storyline by just going to sleep , I tried this a couple times and I got the call from O’Brien .
Look at Lisa becoming strong enough to defend herself. There was once upon a time when she would look to Deek to protect her. Now she's out there collecting bounties. She kind of remind of Deke at the beginning of the game. I really like how Deke isn't forcing himself on her. Just letting her know there's love on this side and she doesn't have to survive on her own.
Post more Plague Tale bro. Love your videos
Hey Brad, been following you since Bioshock Infinite & watching your gameplays ever since. Keep up the good work man
Brad, you can press L2 and R2 to quickly skim over the storylines!

Quick add on: you hold X on your ammo saddlebags. It's glitched where it doesn't show but you can  still collect your ammo
Brad: One bullet left- gotta make it count

misses 
hahahaha I love it lol
You should be getting a call about Nero can't wait for you to upload that part
Continue the play through brad. We love this series.
Favorite you tuber great work on cranking these videos love your channel

Please post more A plague Tale!!!! Great vids Brad❤️❤️❤️💝😘

happy to see another Days Gone THANKS Brad....
hopefully, brad at least does all the hordes (and tries all the 20+ weapons. lool)
Right on time Brad. I expected nothing less 😌
Been waiting, it was like I was relieved when I refresh my page and saw that you posted another one of these videos. Thank you Brad for what you're doing and please keep going

After the ending, Days Gone still has some stories to go on.
That's one of the reasons why I like this game very much.
Keep these coming bruh. Good job. Love from India.❤️🤘
Brad! Keep driving around until O'Brian radios Deacon, that's not a mission/cut scene you want to miss! (& feels like the real ending to the game)
I’ve been with you from the start and will continue watching you as long as you keep it up! Let’s do this... 😉🤪
Complete NERO missions please. Brad.... Love from Pakistan😊😊☺ and yeah one more thing .... this side stuff you are doing is great.

Love this series, I will never understand why someone would rate it anything below a solid 8/10.

Would really like to see you 100% this game. I'm never bored when I'm watching it. Much love, fam.
Thank you for keeping going with this series Brad! I still love this series like the first episode.
Make sure when you do the last O'Brian mission, you have music turned on!
Hi Brad,   you need to have the same gun while you purchased Ammo in your motorcycle to access it
I'm glad for Lisa. She got out OK. This game is a wonderful story! LOVE IT!
Keep me coming! Love these videos! Thank you so much for your hard work and continued gameplay/posting for us! Super appreciate it and you!
Finish finding NERO!! thats my favorite part of this game so far, Ive watch every episode youve posted. awesome stuff!
Five years ago you left us hanging with infamous second son DLC paper trail, still waiting for part 5
You gotta finish the finding Nero missions.... you'll be in for a hell of a twist at the end!
Please finish the NERO storyline. Its got a pretty good ending
You should pick up more of the ears, it would help level up trust with the camps. You always leave after killing the horde without grabbing too many ears.
Am I the only one who missed the Days Gone gameplays? 🥺💗
I just picked up the collector's edition today. And I started the game. It's absolutely awesome. It's fun to watch you play it but damn it's even better to play it for yourself.
keep doing the game brad we want MORE
Thank you Brad! I waited and waited for more Days Gone!
Brad. In one of the videos can u show us the trophies u have let to get. Road to 100
Hey Bro, keep uploading these and I'll keep watching them.  Deacon is my favorite protagonist in any of the series that I've seen... Kinda reminds me of a Marine I use to know (RIP)  Keep up the stellar work my man......
hey brad i've been one of your subs sence your prototype vdays , spelled that wrong but yes. love you man
weird no horde health bar
11:41 looted a rag and smoke bomb from a completely burnt ripper body.....lol
you can give a toy to Boozer's puppy :D
Brad you really are the king of Walkthrough in Youtube.
Much Love From Bangladesh👨‍👩‍👦‍👦😍😍
What part 79 .. And last day i watch it was part 3
About finding Nero. You have to look it up on youtube. There are videos showing you the secret place ;)
Keep going! Am staying with it til 💯 percent!
Finding Nero is the secret ending, you’ve gotta do at least this one... Would be video 80 too! Please Brad! And great job with the series!
If this game had just 1 ending we’d be seeing more plague tale 😔
Tbh brad going wild on the video games lol 😂😂🤣
Wooh 
Was waiting for it
Love from India
Just spam videos I love it😎😎
Oh my god 😱😱
I have never seen like this big amount of zombies in any game 
Such scary 😰😰
But I've been a big fan for the longest
Please finish the o´brian storyline, it´s an awesome ending!!!
From my experience you have to keep doing a bunch of side missions and fast travel a lot to finish the NERO mission. You’ll get a random call from O’Brien
HOW CONVINIENT is becoming a meme on Brad's channel
Hold X near your bike and you pick up your ammo even if the prompt isn’t there
Give me more videos Brad before i throw a chair😤 lol keep up the great work love the game💯
The saddlebag might work anyways, just gotta hold the button down. There's a bug from the last patch that makes the button prompt disappear.
keep playing brad there is a secret ending, also great series bro !
I wonder what happens if u complete the "im not a ripper" storyline?
I like how brad stayed so calm about the bike glitch that wouldn't let him get the ammo from the bike... most of the youtubers would have start swearing and talk shit about the game XDXD
Brads tactical roll and knife 🔥👏🏻😂😂
I'm watching this instead of studying for my final 😂
Please continue to play more days gone. Unedited gameplay of all you do in it is fine! Love this game and I’ll be viewing all the videos you make on this series/game!
Brad, that bear melee takedown was NASTY son!! I didn’t think it was possible but this game just keeps getting better and better fam!! 

Please keep it coming!
Keep posting this series, love to see it at 100% complete. Still more to learn in the amazing "story"....
Love seeing this series popping up still! Thanks Brad!
Loving it. Just complete the game 100% a good surprise is waiting
That was glitch, happened to me too, also, in the middle of a horde fight. I had to restart the game and then it worked again!
Thanks Brad. Didn’t you know you can give toys to Jack. Already give 2 :)
What’s the most difficult PS4 game you have played?
Damn great job on that horde, don't think that I could do that.
Maybe you have to fix the bike first in order to get ammo?
Brad plz max out the Nitrous.[][]
keep aup my friend,  it's really good game... :))
Half a job Brad lol, finish the jobs like horde's missing loads,
Comon Brad, we see that u already made the video, you know we can't get enough of this game. Keep em' coming
last 3-5 episode that you dont carry a melee weapon.
Whoop! Early post finally! Go get em Brad.
Hey Brad finish the NERO storyline its got a good ending from what I read and heard!
Keep going brad you're so close to getting the secret ending just finish all the missions and the hordes i believe
Please do more of days gone 🙏🏻👌🏻
Love, love, love! Thank you for continuing to upload!
Great timing was wondering if a new part would drop today and it's here
show me love buy me game Tom Clancy's wildlands as gift me my ID is zabighost
If u dont plan on recording everything, would love 2 c u at least finish all the hordes
This is essentially an episode where Brad is on his life line no bullets out of  throwables (e.g Grenades) out of stamina and health cocktails and medkits man...............*Survivor Brad mode activate*
Your YouTube channel is my go to video game strategy guide.
Think you can only collect your ammo from 1 side of your bike
You play as long as you want... if you post it I will watch it... Lainey out, and waiting.
Just got my wisdom teeth out, first thing I said when I woke up was "need Brad" then realized no one knew what I was saying. Keep this series going!!
Love the way u nut up on big hordes bro lol it was huge!!!
goodness..part 79..how long is this game? i just reach part where i got puppy for boozer tho...so im still a long way or what?


sorry for the spoilers .had to ask
Cmon Brad another video of days gone "How Convenient"keep up the good work love it
First...Once again 😎
Please spam these videos fro days gone luv you man!!!!
Just keep it going I’ve really been enjoying these vids.
The ammo could be fixed when you save and restart the game the same thing happened to me
I think Deacon and Joel would make a good team up
really like your series, but why don't you get supplies before doing missions like for Hoards especially I just don't understand LOL. Not just ammo but go round find what you need to make molotov Austin the other stuff?
Holy horde Batman! (In abject terror)
Hey, you need to select the horde on the map for the horde's helath bar to show
still lovin these vids man keep it up! <3
Fabulous keep going...love you man!
YOOOO that Bear takedown was awesome
Hey can you please play Generation Zero. It is a post apocalyptic robot survival(ish) game set in Sweden 1980s I don't mind even if it is just one video but can you please consider playing it as I would absolutely love to see you playing it
Cool fun video liked it, luv from Aamir Dada channel 💖
Do the Nero please 💯% Nero Ending special
The main guy always look paranoid to me for some weird reason
With hoards brad alwsys try to stealth kill almost works every time
Continue on my man. This game is amazing!
16:35 that moment Brad missed the opportunity to say "that's bad news bears" rotflmao
Continue to do more as in finding nuro there will be a big suprise do more
hope you  see this i am your big fan since 2015 maan :) i am inspired by you :) love from faf
i will be famous like you too 1 day maybe
Some of the hoards just have a counter on the top right of the screen as u kill them brad bro greay vid
Hi Brad this is an amazing series and still totally hooked would love to see more keep it up
Awesome series hope you continue to play until you complete all the mission's, I hear that there is another ending video or something when you finish everything.
"I have no ammo" walks right past a cops car.
You didn't purchase ammo to put on the bike last time you were at camp. You switched weapons (sniper, etc) and only bought ammo for them. Not extra.
Just made me tear up man. I love this game so much
Damn Brad keep it up loving this game.
Keep on the good work Brad. There are 1 more secret endings.
Why don't you lead the horde to the big guy and let him handle it.
You can just sit back and watch them kill each other.
Hi Brad,
Love your vids man ❤️
Come on man, let's be get prepared first!
When ever u take on the hords u leave ur left side open and on each video they hit u from ur left side! Better be careful!
I am going keep click that like button twice 🤘
Best horde mission cause no health bar "how Convenient "
As soon as you post these, I click right away, I miss them :(
Yow Brad play rage 2 some more please I freaking love your gameplay in rage 2 plus play it😳😵😵😟😦😦😲😵
Now Time for the NERO STORYLINE ENDING!
Love the series! Keep up the great work Brad
WHEN IS THE PLAGUE PART-6 COMING?
For the horde killers, you can make 30 mins videos with cuts, juat showing the action, its not that much important to see the roads and buying supplies
Before you chases zombie horde search all the buildings to build up on your Molotov cocktails and your Napalm cocktails
I was kinda rooting for the bear to win that fight. lol
What happened with Sekiro? We destroyed the like button and no more videos.
Brad, please do more videos of this game :)
Brad - that bear 1-hit kill was amazing!
I got one bullet left make it count and he miss the shot lol and you made my day
fell asleep waiting.. hahaha. good job! want to see more
Honestly, what a grind this has been. I wish I could afford to get this, but this game has been epic. Glad you did a series on it bc you’re by far one of the best channels out here. Really enjoyed watching these man. Great to see how well the channel is doing to this day
Part 79... How the heck long is this GM?
Is this bug with not getting any ammo from the satchel bag after the latest patch?
Turn your light out and they won't see you. You always have it on. Turn it off.
It's awesome 
The game n Brad's gameplay
I was just thinking, you should of took that horde and led them to the camp.  You would of killed two birds with one stone.  You wasted all your resources on that horde.  That's why recon is key.
We shall get lisa DLC aye..
Keep playing this game man !!! I wanna know the end....
Y'all better smash that like button cause I love this damn series so much. I want to see him clear it all and see the Nero story finish.
14:13 Brad the slasher! 🔪☠️😂
Tell me why lisa looks like thug rose namajunas  with short hair
Hey Brad, yer new Indian name is Bear Killer! Lol
Brad passes by a police car and complains about having no ammo.
Great video please keep recording them Brad.
Brad the trunk of Cop cars have bunch of Ammo
This has to be the best game this year but let's see what happens when last of us 2 comes out they have to go hard af
Please keep it up 100% WANTED
you did lead the first horde to the big guy, they even took about 10 seconds to run over him.
100 percent the game so I can see the secret ending I've been avoiding so I can watch it in your series .
New Brad video clicks how convenient
There is a taser in the game . collect 15 things? At Nero check points. Do a test see if you can burn nests with it?
Finish finding NERO!!!!!!  IT'S WORTH SEEING O'BRIEN AGAIN!
Finding nero story is a secret ending with obrian you are gunna want to see that people are saying it leads to another days game in the future 👍🏻love these videos bro 👊🏻
You have to buy The ammo for The bike from merchant
Tnx Brad, keep them comming :D
Great series and you must really like playing this game?
Will you have a team from a camp to face a supermassive horde
Do the hordes man come on already and 50 cal kills 3 at a time
Can you do 2 hordes for a video please and thank you
I Think Brads last video will be about o brien.
Okay Brad enough days gone you already beat it I wanna see plague tales and rage please. You haven't been posting shit the past few days
What about the O'Brian secret ending?
Keep putting out the videos please. Enjoying every one.
Please finish O'Brian story line Brad :)
Are you going to play the new ghost tea on
2:53 "Burn all thuuu beeebeeeess!!!!"  --Tiny Tina
Hey brad i just got to say your the reason i just bought my first playstation i got a ps4 pro and days gone if it wasn't for you i would have never gotten into this amazing game
Hey brad I would recommend to do back to back hordes just collect in between and cut them together
Hey brad you should do the NERO ending
I always get to the video late 😑
where is rage 2 part 4 and 5 i like the series
The O'Brien ending is pretty crazy!
Rough?? Lol dude ur crazy ur jus no good at hordes
why do bereghost games radbrad and someone else I forgot upload at the exact same time?!?
Brad "I don't want to waste anytime here" spends half the video taking out a pointless horde
Please do Nero storyline next!!! Its super important!!
How about to finish Finding Nero Storyline?
they grow up so fast (sniffing noise)
You need to be tracking the horde on the map in order to see the health bar
Thank his this is not a first person shooter game
Being a riper made Lisa grow up so much.
It a hurricane of videos it’s amazing it’s like when you see one u don’t have to wait for another
Do the NERO ending, please.
Brad max out your bike at Diamond Lake..
It’s the ammo type, Brad. Your saddlebag has ammo for the Chopper & RPD but you’re carrying the Chopper & 50cal. If you notice at the beginning of the video, the game says you must drop your current carried weapon to take saddlebag ammo (around 0:38 mark).
You are ammazing man brad love you 😘
Batman Arkham knight was a long game too! Keep this videos coming
Finish the NERO storyline Brad.
keep playing to finish the Nero story!
Finish the ripped apart storyline the skin you get is so cool
East or West Brad is the best 😀😀👍👍

Thankyou Brad again for another Video

BEST QUALITY YET 💯 KEEP IT UP
Keep it up man! Love it!
Early early!!
I NEED MY DAILY DOES OF PLAGUE TALE!
Brad, please do the Horde missions 100% and record it. It's actually really fun watching Deke gets chased by dozens of freaks LoL and we also want to see the NERO ending people keep talking about
Please spam us with all the videos.. I'm startin to watch Plague Tale.. and there's not much of a video to see. And I want Days Gone complete it's side quests.... Please Spam us.
Hello Brad, hope you're doing well
Dude!!!  Finish it all man!!!  Keep them coming
I hope you complete 100% of game
I can but like and sub once, so hopefully it'll be enough to finish the story lines.  (For all I know they may already be "in the can".)  The Infestation, Horde and Ambush camp stuff seem more like things to do to increase money and exp.
Keep up the amazing work
For some reason that horde was glitched for me.  I killed all of them and more randomly spawned in the cave after, but I got the horde after killing those ones too.
Hey Brad, this is my first time commenting on your channel, I just want to say you are my favorite youtuber and I Love your videos bro, been following for a long while now, keep up the good work bro. As a 33 year old gamer I appreciate your hard work as a youtuber. Much Love to you and keep up the good work. BTW! by far Days gone has been the best game with such a captivating story for me second to Red dead redemption is second.
About time we do the Lisa story line
Dude, it escapes me how you keep forgetting to check cop car trunks for ammo.  You know its there, but you seem to forget to look a lot.  Your bike was right beside the cop car at the hoard and you didn't check the trunk.
well you did had 2 bags but did you buy the ammo?
Your strong to fight boss in short distance
Go to sleep to get the real ending.
Good way to start the Friday!  Thanks Brad!

I am sorry kids, There cant be 10 people who are first
You can attack a horde then leave if you cant fight them save and come back the horde will still be weakened from where you attacked it. Picking up where you left off. I had to do this a couple of times.
Are you gonna play Rage 2 today ?
What a bear fight! Go on Brad!
You should just upload them all at once and make them longer! Also, I think you annoy most of us when YOU DON'T COLLECT EVERYTHING and then say that you don't have the money or gear. lol.

LETS GO
A plague tale please !!!!
Thought about telling a prediction; that you might be ultimately completing this game by "Part 85, or 90". Been loving it... Don't know if you caught my previous comments, & an indication, but I don't think there's been a game that takes place in Oregon since The Goonies II on NES, & I do live in Oregon - Salem, Oregon that is. & don't think I've ever been to that part of Oregon (in Days Gone I mean) I've never been to or near Crater Lake. Think the (closest I've ever been near there was Roseburg, OR.
12:26

Hey Brad I wonder if you could make more vids in a day like days gone man. I loved everything about this game they made really good job there. Don't you think?
Hugo the Rat King  ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
Hi, Brad !! Here's an idea. A "more, please" button. And we could use Oliver twist as the button icon. Proud of myself.
Thank you for uploading again Brad! I enjoyed the video but it felt so short I want more 😂 I understand you've been uploading videos like crazy so I understand. But just know.....I can't wait for the next part
I've been waiting all day for this! :D
Brad upload another video today! I’m loving this game 😭
Keep uploading more of these Brad! I'm always disappointed when the video ends. I've seen other youtube playthroughs that are further in the game, but I been staying loyal to your playthrough!
I finished this game today literally one of the best story played this year after days gone 
But game is very tricky and I am genuinely scared for brad like how carelessly he plays lol
I'm so excited to see your video's about this story , keep going , 
let's get this ! been watching all of your video's 
we love you brad !
10 mill Facecam video ? I really want to see that. You're amazing 😅
Liked the video before I even started the video. Tempted to watch other YouTube videos to finish the story but I'll stick with Brad!
Man I use to watch your channel every day when you uploaded infamous second son and know I´ve returned, this videogame is amazing :V
Legends say when brad was born his first words were
"So what's up guys......"
Loving this series! You talk just the right amount in your videos IMO. Like there is enough commentary but you still let the characters have their lines also. I'm hooked buddy <3
Please make the plague tale videos longer 30 or 35 mins xD
Man this game is amazing. Keep it going Brad!
LMFAO a brand new one it's a stick, so funny Brad !!
Wish you through rocks at everyone’s head when playing. Lol
Hugo says Oh no we’re trapped ! Brad reply’s impossible it’s a video game there always a way ! Lol
I'm liking this game I wasn't sure at first but it's growing on me.;-D
Brad at this point is safe to say you can finish the game you are at part 5 ;)
Please make the videos longer if you cannnn. 20 minutes of this is NOT ENOUGH!! Its too good.
If only jacksepticeye would play this game
Gameplay: Uncharted
Atmosphere: Vampyre and Hellblade had a macabre baby in France
i love your videos man, been watching you for years and still always getting entertained, i dont have a gaming console but if i had one id just give it to you and watch you play haha keep it up man
Hey, much love from Serbia! I feel like I'm watching TW show when I watch your videos.  Keep the show rolling ^^
8:05
I think what may have happened is that the game wanted you to ignite the torch spot next to the guy from afar, then make your way with your own touch. 
That’s my best guess.
I don't know why but I've fallen in love with Amicia. 😍
IGN give 7.0, should I trust IGN?
I love this game😍. It’s like a combination of Styx and Tomb Raider. Waiting for the next part 😁 thank you Brad!
I started watching you after my younger sister watched your play of dead space. :)
Love you brad,loving this game,cant wait to see it accelerate
I was literally just sad cuz I checked your channel for an update on this gameplay and didn't see any but it just popped up on my homepage. I have never clicked on a video so fast before in my life.
I'd been looking out for this all day! Love watching this game so far!
love this! thank you and more please!
which ones better rad brad days gone or a plague tale innocence or rage 2?
Thank you brad it’s awesome game and driving story too
Could we get multiple parts a day of this game? I’m addicted honestly
Plague Tale is getting more views than Days Gone! 😂😂😂
moreeeeeee i want more plague vids ....atleast 2 vids per dya bradddd love u
I am from Iraq and I follow you since many years , I'm so like you ,🌷❤
keep it going brad
this game is amazing
How Convenient  Brag Keep It Up👍❤❤
they didn't have chloroform in the medievel times...so that would have been seen as witchcraft...or magic...or alchemy shiz
This parts different ??? ... Lmao .... Lets watch you throw another rock 👁️👁️
Don't use to much of sleeping gas...it can save you later if you get caught and it's hard to make to...so save it
Ohh good brad, please more minute :'(
When brad uploads a video 
There is never a dull moment👌
Love you too! Been waiting for this and 20m is too short. ;-;
I'm loving this I hope you play it all the way thru! 😍
You made my day brad! Thanks a lot!!
Could u b fast for the next part
theRadBrad be careful with the Somnum! It may impact your upgrades in the future since it costs so much to craft! Remember that.
Rad can yoy please spam this game its really fun to watch , thank you rad love you man
You should do longer episodes of this game because I'm really enjoying it and i hate when a episode ends .
1hour 40 minutes..  Before sir Brad post a new vid haha
Please upload faster! Cant wait heheheh hugs to you Brad!
i love the content, i was watching the firts 4parts this morning at work😂i was waiting for part 5😃
ive really enjoyed watching u play these games - pls upload more!
Please keep the videos coming, we want to know what happens next! Thank you Brad!
I really like the voice acting and the atmosphere for this game!
THANK U BRAD LOVE IT 
EVEN THOUGH IM STILL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VID 😂😍
When Brad couldn't figure out what to do with the corpse right away I was just dying.
Wow best gameplay ever. I cannot wait to see more.
Honestly im so hooked up with the story i cant wait another minute for next ep amazing job
I am just giving my opinon, but this game is more entertaining than Days Gone And other AAA games. LOve your walkthroughs , Brad. Keep it up:)
Dude I remember the days when you played Twisted Metal. Those were the days. I saw you on my recommendation and I was like “ Oh he’s still doing YouTube”. Glad to see you again!
PLEASE UPLOAD MORE OF THEESE! BEEN WAITING ALL DAY LONG!
Amazing series, we love you Brad!
I wonder if helping the guard would have had some sort of effect. They mention that Hugo has something in him that isn't good or evil so I feel like the choices you make might change that.
Why is short 💔 we need the 54 minutes to be back
I wana see you do a dark souls series. Lots of puzzles & hidden stuff
I love u
.. But u need to play this game more... Love it
Rage2 plz but its okay if u dont want to make the vid
There is another YouTuber that has the whole game in like a few hours  but I prefer you
I liked the long videos more. I wanna see everything of the game not just 20 minutes mehh
hey brad i aint tryna rush your but can you post this oftenly like how you posted Days Gone? or if not then it's cool
More lol game is so interesting. Want to see what happens make this a full play through
More more more plz zaddy brad! 😍🤩
aaaaahhh- feel sad now that i have finished watching this one. can't wait for tomorrow's update!
Keep up the great work on the vids Brad!! ❤❤
Hol up, wasn't this on like the trailer for it??
Can we get a part 6 please 🥺 got my addicted to this game already 😁😁
I know its a lot to ask but we need more. Please and Thank you
I like how the stick disappears instead of just burning out
Can't wait to play it! (It's gaming man!)
Part 2 - “oh no, i have to kill him,. There’s gotta be another way. Part 5 - “13:39”
Super glad you're still playing this. This game seems like it's going to be a sleeper hit.
Bro this game reminds me of That brothers game where u use the same controller to control both brothers
I was so sad that the video ended
Hey Brad you are cool man if you would have time to bring out some videos  each day butt only if you have time great content
I love your chanel it's awesome! When dead island 2 comes out will you be playing it?
Come on Brad you can do more than one video a day hook us up bro.😁
541 on likes yes! Already finished damn and its such a good game pls post next part soon
you can control the rats At the eng of the game with Hugo. He finds out he has a special power. You said you wanna know how it ends :))) welcome
I'm loving this series keep it up Brad
I am ready for more, this game is awsome. Cool stuff Brad!
I wish these episodes were longer! Keep up the amazing work though! Can’t wait to see more :D
I got hooked on this immedaitly omg. I was supposed to be sleeping but meh, this is way better
I'm so hooked in this series! I need Episode 6😂
In 11:00 I thought Lucas died when you left him behind
Hope I am not to later to win. Love your videos and keep up the good work.
Lucas: “The cart, maybe we can use it?”
Me: No shit, Sherlock!
Were in it for the long haul as well.Hope u finish the game .
This game has such a unique concept, I think its awesome!
Keep it on dude.you're doing great. Love it 👍
So I just saw the ending...and I'm quite disappointed.
More please ...somehow I am becoming invested in these characters.
you dont have to play rage 2 just do this game
Binged all of these episodes in one go. Super excited for the next one.
I was refreshing youtube every 10 minutes to see if you uploaded a video of this game. btw you are amazing Brad.
I also discovered your chanel 1 year ago and ever since then me and my sister have been watching your videos!💙 we always yell at the TV whenever you mess up or miss something😂 then we remember you can't hear us
Solder boy: be like tiger tiger tiger
Brad can you make this series longer♥️
I luv it when u say
"How convenient"
It's a great time period game & the story is definitely interesting
Brad has that dead eye from all that experience in days gone! 0:44 is the highlight of this video
So are you gonna upload more Rage 2 videos today ?
Every day when I see my dog I say “heyyyyy buddy” just like you lmao
Fan from Morocco Brady. keep going
Please more brad! It’s so interesting to see what happens next 😎
Hey Brad!! You're AWESOME! 😍
MKIceandFire has allready put longer playtrough on his channel for anyone who dont want to wait...
I am going to be SO SAD if you don’t finish this! I just might go on strike!
Looks like you could have lit the torch next to the guy with ignifer
Brad your uploads are so short bud, just get into it and it's over, make them longer fam,
I need more I am hooked on it an you leave evil cliff hangers brad
youre using some upgrade mats to make bombs so use materials wisely
Jesus, just an hour in and the views. Chiiil
nice let´s play:) I look forward to another part
1 part per day.. that's not fair 😑😣
Maaan, it takes you so long to figure things out that you actually have to cut the video. You're not very smart, are you?
I thought it was gonna be live. What happened brad
I've been waiting for this! I don't know if u see my comment that always been waiting for another part of this.. I just woke up, and I saw this! Thanks for making my day better Brad.. btw, I've made a video for you. I don't know if u see this comment but the video is about all your intros compilation.. like " let's do this!, With that being said, let's do this guys!" and everything.. I will make next about " HOW CONVENIENT" 😁😁😁
BEST GAME EVER...!!!!!!!!  What are the weirds cuts u have in the video brad?? Do you die or something??
Been watching your videos since 2010You
This game makes me itch in a bad way..😶 rats
Please upload more! Hooked on this game! 😍
I wish you turned on the background music it's so good. ut besides that the game is so good
In this game they take an idea from uncharted 2...
Could you play new ghost recon wild lands
Yesss I’ve been craving more of this game
Loving this series! Can’t get enough! 🎮❤️
I love this game keep it up brad
I'm obsessed with this game! It's amazing
Recently watched a video containing a top ten list of brads jump scares, finally got to see where the f**k you chair originated from. Keep up the good work brad, been watching you for the past 4 years and every video gets better.
You definitely can save that guy. You had to go forward with the torch about halfway (to see the torch at the end of the hall), then walk back to the start of the hall and put the torch down to use the ignifier stone. He says he is grateful and won't call the guards.
Lets go BRAD keep the series going!!!!
I am not what it is, but your game play is the best online
where TF was my notification...
This game is getting more and more interesting by the day
Spoiler alert 
Hugo is not effectes by the plague
One problem with this game I am at the end of the game and there are still more room to upgrade in the upgrade inventory, WHY ??
You could have of saved the solder you get a trophy for doing it your supost to hit the ignite thing on the ember by him
Just got my copy of this game, all thanks to you theradBrad
How many times Brad is going to repeat these phrases in the next episode? Lock in your bets!
1) This part is so different
2) man i really like this game
3) i can"t say enough good things from this game
4) looks like a low budget game but its better than some AAA games
5) i can't thank you guys enough for the support i really didn't think i would have so much support of this game
this game is so friggin cool i love it!!
Love this game... Feels sooo similar to The Last of Us. enemies? foes, rats? the infected?, Hugo? Ellie
As i was watching this video an add for this game played at the part you entered the tower
yea there are ...you really could have saved him...and i think there are different endings by the good or bad you do in the game

Better than days gone keep going
Owow they been busted o no I hope they escape with the boy and the two other people's who freed her and the boy
Will you ever use a face-cam?
I laughed so hard when you lit the fire after the guy died
Brad, I know that the Somnum is a great tool but don't spam it. It costs A LOT and it will detriment you badly like, not being able to upgrade your equipment, or to make more ignifers. Just saying.
Please play the whole game for us ❤️
I’m enjoying this game

Hi
You don't have game smart
Part 6 😍👏👏
MORE! MORE! MORE!  lol
Reminds me of that movie pitch black
AWWOME as always bro
that amount of chromatic aberration for a medieval game, the post process department went wild. I dont see any part of the screen clearly focused, game is blurry as fk. AA washes the picture's details. Im surprised they didnt add film grain on top of that. Or maybe its youtube's shitty compression that ruined this video.
Keep ‘em coming!!
More brad!!!
This is so sick
Really nice gameplay cool 🤙
You better play inhist
Yoooo part 6 please!

I really don't understand who dislikes any of these videos. Like no matter what there are always people who dislike them. What could you possibly dislike about this? Brad is a great guy and he is playing an interesting game. I understand if this isn't for you, but to actually dislike it? I don't know, its just strange to me.

I truly want this series to get 100% completed on cam. 
Great fan of yours.
Yo brad! Would it be too much to ask if you made a longer video for Days Gone? Maybe killing hordes and using new guns... that would be awesome brother! Thanks for the content and love the channel.
I want to see what happened to that girl who got rescued from RIP by deacon. And Nero ending also XD
Love your video Brad keep doing more

BRAD WE LOVE DAYS GONE. KEEP PLAYING UNTIL COMPLETION BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SOME MORE STUFF COMING
I just finished this game and thanks to you RadBrad. 
Such an incredible story and game play. The only game this year I felt like I wanted to play and finish.
Bro you are just awesome. Want to see more of day's gone, specially horde killing
Brad plz continue past episode 80..plus don't forget to get those new set of tyres you can literally ride down those big zombies with those bike upgrades..

And of course the Nero Storyline
I'm loving this, Plague Tale, and Rage 2! Although Rage 2 is a bit cartoony compared to the original. Thanks for continuing to entertain us, Brad!
Finish the nero storyline Brad, you won't believe how hype that ending is
All my" days gone" watching these videos 😂😂 how Convenient!!!
Bro, you're one of my top people on YouTube! When you said I'm just doing things. I said let's ride fam. I felt like I was talking to a friend.
Please more of this game! I have watched every single part and would love to see it played all the way to 100%! You rock brad!
Hey Brad saying Hi all the way from South Africa. Keep the awesome content coming. Hope to play this game soon. Looks amazing.
I'm not usually a fan of zombie type  games as I'm a big wuss  but you've made this game  absolutely  addictive. 😁
So proud of you and how far you’ve come! Keep up the great work! You’ll always have a supporter in me!
omg I cant take it anymore. Marauders is pronounced Muh-rah-ders. Sorry, but it's gone on far too long. keep up the good work.
brad try to circle them up first so you could maximize the nade's effectivity
Do more A plague tale innocence and rage 2 please!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁🍻
5:15 The Bear Wants To Know Where You Live.
Keep it up Bro, love the story and the action!
we need the plague tale spam! enough with days gone already :(
Deek is an old soul. I like this game because of the characters. Same was for Detroit. Awesome game
Trying to get caught up on this series man! Really glad you’re still grinding! Today is actually my 22nd birthday, any chance I could get a shoutout haha? If not no worries, loving the videos Brad!
Not a video gamer.. but like watching these videos.    Keep it up man!
M watching at night with lights off so every time brad opens the map my eys goes skrrra!!😂😂
Loving this! All 78 have been awesome!! Cannot wait for more!
always enjoyable while eating lol
whatever you play its like a movie to me now 
Endless movie
"Welcome to part 78" lol its funny hearing Brad say that.
Upgrade your bike at diamond lake camp
Love your days gone series Brad and the pleague story keep pumbin up videos mahn with lot of love and respect for ya🤗
Thank you Brad! Love this series best game of all time for me.
Even the video still buffering, i already gave you thumbs up
Watching since part 1.
watching Brad play and listening to him after a shitty day is a blessing
A Marder was a WW2 German Tank Destroyer. A Ma-raud-er is something totally different. Reminds me of the time Brad pronounced "Demolisher" as Demo-LISH-er in Dying Light. 


Just messin' with ya Brad. :)
Holy Shit 10 million subscribers, I've been watching since 2011,and its just crazy thinking about how far the channel has progressed since then.
I did watch all of it...and i ll watch till u stop...which i dont want...i love ur days gone gameplays
Watched from the start, amazing GAMEAGE Brad, took a while but you smashed it guy,
Please 1 heart watching you since resident evil 7 and subbed...
Your the only one who plays the games in a order bro keep it up your the best 👍
Hey Brad, I can not DESTROY that like button fast enough!  I hope it's working and more vids are coming down the pipeline!!!
Anyone wanna add me on PlayStation? I haven't got many people to play with so it would mean alot, is this game worth buying? I've heard it didn't live up to its hype according to people I know
There’s a secret cut scene with O’Brian when u finish everything look it up on YouTube and react to it, it’s crazy👍🏼
Plz Brad next time max out the Nitrous.[][]
Thank you for taking out all those loud speakers before hitting that generator button!  Please keep these videos coming!
100% it in vids brad. We'll keep watching.
Please keep playing Days Gone! I enjoy every minute of it. Since I’m an Xbox player I get to experience it through your videos! Thanks !
What are these💁🏽‍♂️💁🏽‍♂️ I thought u was done with the game
This has been a great playthrough to watch. I think the game has been reviewed low. But I like it. Would like to see closeout of the story lines.
Hi @theradbrad i got a question....if im a casual console gamer should i switch to pc....I like good graphics and want to try pc but all my friend have ps4....should i switch or stay woth console??
I've seen a few videos of people using attracters to group the zombies and then throw explosives into the group
Waiting for this💞

Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Was watching Rage and then this comes out. Leeetss goo Braad haha 😍
"El BradO" , i really love this serie. it's being a hell of a ride.  The one thing i might say is that "i'm not getting triggered by the fact that you keep skiping the O'Brian NERO ending".
Dear Brad,
1. keep the videos coming. i love this game
2. please go swimming. i want to see what happens
3. i'm a chair thrower myself
and 4 keep up the good work. i discovered you by watching ur GTA V series. or was it Until Dawn? 🤔


sincerely,
broke college student from Jamaica
This is amazing. Keep it going. More horde missins

Yeah we would like more hope you finish everything 💪🏼
Keep it coming one of my favourite game I really hope they bring out a second one love you Brad been with you from day one
There's no one else I would rather watch playing games. I've been watching since 2013 (from a different account though)
That bounty girl at diamond lake, did she say goodbye in japanese?
EArRRLyYY. Notice me Brad San!!!!
That time that the 'other' marker stayed on was the time you found Abby but then left behind Gabby.  And it didn't get fixed until the game decided that Gabby was saved despite you abandoning her.
Hey Brad, I heard that you get a gun called the Rock Chuck ( silenced ) if you clear all the camps
There's a secret ending where you meet obrian, please keep playing
Please! Complete all of the storylines! That would be the best! Thanks!
Yes we want more. Did you see Sarah after the the story end :)
I was watching part 77 I checked I found part 78 how convenient
Please do all the hordes Brad I love Days Gone, but most importantly I love you and your videos Brad thank you for the hours of enjoyment! Have a good day Brad
this is the best serie on yt keep up the good work brad!!!!!!!1
Yoo brad you doing awesome bro ease check out the diamond lake camp or Copeland's camp for the gas upgrade level V
I'm curious to know if you managed to pick the gas can up or not at the end 😅😁✌️ 24:28
Definitely easier than dying light. That game was insane!
Greetings from uruguay!!!! Superfan!!!!
All days see you great man d'ont change!!!
Brad idk if u do it on purpose or not but u shoot alot more bullets than what u need 😂😂😂
don't stop showing this game because it's so good and I enjoy watching you play it so keep putting it up.
Plz do more partsvthanks brad👍💯
Finish the Nero storyline please brad and try to get 100% completion thanks brad much appreciated
You should buy ammos and stuffs at other camps. So that you can save money to buy parts for your bike at that camp.
Hi brad thanks for all the videos. here's a tip on the hords, they come out of caves at night and go back in at day .THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!
Love the channel. Loved the series. Please continue posting more videos for this game. Can't believe how good the game is.  You are awesome Brad.
Love from Egypt💕
Since 2013.💓
If oneplus made a radbrad edition one plus 7 pro I would take it
The hordes are too easy, if you go there half prepared then your good, because the horde can’t catch you even if your jogging
can u stll see sarah and boozer and Rikki now that you completed the game or are they no long involved in the gamne for some reason
Really enjoyed this series hope there are more vids coming soon
Hey Brad why don't you stealth kill the horde  use attractor craft it ,would be helpful
Dont ever stop recoding it. We love this game. Road to 100%
Please do continue with this Brad! Also, could you try using the residue bolts on the horde to see if they'll turn on eachother?
Those videos are the best, the game too! Love from Russia ❤
Yo rad im one of the first few 100 ppl to wtch this. Been watching since gta 5 keep it up
Brad you getting lame af now..We want more hordes
Rad: Kerosin is very crucial and i always lack it ignores 25 kerosine tanks
You are supposed to run into Lisa that will complete the Ripped Apart and the Lisa storyline
78 part and you Still try to find the horde in a cave,at night, WTF ?!
Please play more and finish all story lines luv you man!!!
Hey Brad, look up how to pronounce Marauder ... you’re saying it wrong. Just busting your balls man. Really enjoyed this game!
There’s still the nero storyline to complete, it reveals a big twist brad.
Hey this game will be bigger than Red Dead Redemption 2
“there’s a bear behind me” but there’s also a giant rock that doesn’t move that will probably kill brad before a bear will 💀💀
The freakers roam around at night and hibernate in their respective caves during the day.
click like if brad will finish all the missions..👊
Lmao was watching rage and this comes out 😍🔥
Diamond lake is good place for bike upgrades.
You should upload more parts from A plague tale incidence
brad you could probably use the flamethrower when you get around to taking down all the nests since you're always missing kerosene
Keep puting out videos till you finish all the horeds💯
Your videos are very fun to watch thank you for playing this game im hooked on it so much and you make it more funner i been watching your videos since i was 13 and now im 18
Love seeing you clear out hordes!!! Awesome!!!! Keep it up
You actually just can do the livestream which maybe you don't really need to do much of editing for the days gone
Dude pls upgrade the bike to max I want to see the baddass decan bike
rad, I suspect you are doing stuff without us, 2 episode ago you had 2k in your bank account , this video you had 13, are you being sneeky with us and have fun all by yourself,lettin us in the dirt? we want to see all my lord, ALL!!! 
Loving you man, ^^
Another Update!!! You can shoot bodies now! In days gone!
I like your vids, but dont miss those fast travels. They are around the map, take a closer look and you will see them.
Finish recording everything you going to go crazy on the last Nero mission
Brad purchase the drifter tyres (off road) from wizard island brother those tyres are bad ass.😏
Good job, Brad. I have never watched that many videos for one game. Thanks. Btw, you think you can stock up some Molotovs before starting videos? Then you would be prepared and ready with no hesitation.
After dark it divides between 3 spots: lair, watering hole, and feeding ground. They’ll never be in their lair after dark, they’ll be going between drinking and feeding till morning
I got platinum this game is 4/10
Don't stop now man! Run her till the end!
It’s let’s do dis! Not let’s get this! I like it better when you say that! Btw “how convenient lol I love it when you say that too!
YOU NEED TO GET THE O'BRYAN SECRET ENDING !!! YOU GOING TO FLIP YOUR SHITTTT
DO THE FKN NERO STORYLINE SO U CAN FIND OUT WHATS HAPPENING WITH THE FKN ZOMBIES>> ISNT THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GAME?? FFS
Upload more videos of Rage 2 today Brad. Upload at least 3 videos of Rage 2 each day.
Nice video Brad, looking forward to more!
Oh wow this game has a lot of chapters to go.  keep it up 😉
Really Jealous when this game wasn't on PC. This game is great if play on PC
complete the nero mission brad it has an ending twist scene
If they make another on e the should add multiplayer
I love this game thanks for keeping it going after u finished the main story
I've been enjoying your videos since 2016 and im 17 years old now, keep it up brad still supporting your videos up to this day! From the philippines...:)
lol i juuuust posted i need more on the last part. thank you!
Take a horde through an enemy camp and see what happens!
Lol did anyone see that one guy T posing in the air🤣
O'brian said that these freaks evolving, hope to see that in the sequel.
Should probably turned in bounties to Tucker or Copeland since your reputation with them is not full yet.
Get the two secret endings you are missing. One finishes Lisa's storyline and the other has an intriguing turn of events with O'Brian.
You keep saying remastered. They have already said that ps5 will be backwards compatible with PS4 games. So there would be no point. They could just release a patched that would make better use of the ps5
Well you should not expect a horde to be in a cave during the night. They only sleep there during the day
This game rules I have watched  every one. I have said this before  best series  since God of.war
Brad, Please complete the missions to 100% and you will be able to get a secret ending wherein you will know wether it will have a part 2 or not. And let us know what you think about it.
I would love to see some hour long episodes of this game of just you roaming collecting all the achievemens or just doing random side missions Brad!
thank you brad for spamming us with the game! hope to see more!!
the game was awesome but i was disapointed kinda cuse they didnt give Sarah a lot of story time i hope that she has some story after the main story
You should have used the bear as a horde distraction and start crafting distractor items (namely the attractor), then bomb the heck outta those undead.
there's another ending when you get everything to 100%!!
Why is that bounty collector talking Japanese lol
Can days gone have multiple saves on one account ?
Hey Brad -  my grandson Brandon suggested I check you out when I was stuck playing the last of us-  keep doing what you do 😊 
 Days gone is so awesome - just when you think it can’t get  any better it does  -please keep up the videos we all want  to see you get  to 100 percent
I would like to see the finding nero storyline.
MOAR BRAD..WE NEED MOAR!
Complete the whole thing. Radbrad keep it up
Literally just finished catching up on this series and finished part 77. Turned on notifications and 78 popped up. How Convenient! Really need to put that on a shirt Brad. Keep it up man. I appreciate this because I don't have a PS4 but I may borrow a friend's because this is an AWESOME game

Keep them coming Brad love the work
Tq so much rad brad, please upload more
The reason the horde wasn't in the cave is because at night they go to the closest lake to drink water
Can you make a video where you speak about the Best games you’ve played? I don’t know what to watch. I’ve seen your “uncharted 4” series i think it is, “Detroit: become human” they are the best untill now in my opinion. I’ve seen “assassins creed” up to ep 28 and I’m not done yet. I SERIOUSLY LOVE your content on this channel. And I absolutely love the games you play. I just know what to watch next. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
FINISH THE OBRIAN STORY PLZ BRAD
Finish Nero theres a hint for part 2 😉
Love this please don’t ever stop!
Brad I love days gone, but I miss Hugo :P 🤙🏻
Keep them coming brad don’t stop until there’s At least 200 parts fam this an addiction I’m not willing to get rid off 😅

You should loot before going to any horde, also get a melee weapon. Please just stop anywhere that have building so you can do the looting. Please also clear the nests as it will enable you to fast travel more often. Lastly please do more of days gone. Been here since the first part
Finish the game %100!
I want more! Who wants more?
STOP PLAYING THIS GAME AND PLAY PLAGUE
Bro u a LEGEND :D
Go in at night when they're all out. Place remote bombs. Wait till they come in at dawn, then blow them all up.
Brad if you do decide to not record while playing the videos can you at least create another channel where you can upload those videos. Because its people that still want to watch the game even though the main story has ended. The game is really good plus you can do that for other future games as well. (Im just sayin)
Hell yeah horde mode

Game: 3 shots to kill zombie with Chicago Chopper

Brad: ehh, I’d say about 20 bullets should be just enough to kill one zombie
Wuhuuu! Have been waiting my whole life for this episode!
And as you get further into the horde killer line, you unlock the best sidearm, rifle, and mg in the game
Make this blue if you’re an ØG

Dishonored good game but I hope they remastered it.
Crackdown/Redfaction/doom/saintsrow 4/madmax
Have you played NFS no limits?
Brad the reason u got no ability is bc u haven’t been doing side missions the side missions give ability’s
It’s like they stole from days gone and set it in the future or something.. trash
It's a future version of mad max
You beat other youtubers upload scheduel 😅
More more more

All I can say
I didn't know Donald Trump was in this game
Fps version of Mad Max
you can shoot the gatling gun btw
You now you have gatling guns on your car, right?
I wonder if there are different endings depending on which character you play as.
Sounds like the DJ from burnout paradise
We want more rage 2 less A plague tale ☹️☹️
Is this a good game?  I'm thinking about picking it up later today but wanna know how other people are liking it so far

It might not be perfect, few games are, but the more I see the more I like it. Please keep going if you can Rad Brad!  Fun to hear a kind of throaty blast from your shotgun.  I remember in Borderlands you could run over some of the uh local natives, hoping you can do that in Rage 2 as well.  Fun!
is the voice actor from fallout 3 or new vegas?
You're the best YouTuber ever Brad
if you're having fun, keep the series going. don't leave us hanging.
How about A Plague Tale Innocence no more? :(

Klegg looks like guy fieri
Please spam us with plague tale innocence
This game looks like wolfenstein and borderlands had a baby...a pretty cool baby
rage just seems like a xbox 360 game that you find at the bottom of the clearance bin.
The rad brad has really inspired me to make a YouTube channel I'm not the best gamer but I want to do it for all the viewers I would appreciate it if people could go over to my channel and show me some support feel free to give negative that helps me to do better.
First
98 views 245 likes man youtube is drunk
Mk fire and ice is better than you
Is it me or are all the characters ugly?
Do the arks for extra power and shit. Idk if you have in this vid since I just started it, but you honestly should...even if it’s on your own time and not in the video
thank you god a decent gamer that dosent block your feed with fortnite god blesss
I was here first
Heck yes we want more! Keep em coming!!!
Hugo: There's  so many of them. We're  stuck.
Brad: I don't  think we're. There's  always a way. It's a video game, we got this hugo😂😂
KEEP PLAYING! LOVE THIS GAME! I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! 🎮❤️
It's a nice fantasy and adventure game..!!
I always watch Radbrad’s videos when I’m eating my dinner  LOL😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Honestly a gaming legend💯 thank you brad for our fix of daily uploads. 😊
Can you start posting 2 to 3 of these a day?🙏🏾😭💯
Damn this game rocks...  Make the parts a little more longer about 40 mins
Just finished 3rd episode. How convenient
This game is amazing keep up the vids brad.
Hugo is so freaking cute! I loved it when he was talking to the pig! So precious
I was just about to finish part 3 and brad uploads part 4. HOW CONVINIENT!!
When I first saw this game trailer I was hoping you play it 
AND YOU DID!!!
HOW CONVENIENT!!!!!!!
THANKS BRAD
I have been watching you for half a decade and you are 
, Phenomenal but will you show Your mess ups for realistic perspective
"there's always a way out. this is a video game OH HE-"


ME: WAIT COME BACK BRAD
There's always a way out, Hugo. It's a video game. 😂
I'm enjoying this game! Yess keep the videos coming!!!
how dare you abruptly end it like that?!
If this is Blue You’re An OG TheRadbrad $ubscriber😝
👇You Can Be A OG Og Mine Today💞
How can you be the best youtuber and only get 13k? Come on everyone!
Dude I can see the other videos in the playlist ... Why don't u make them available?! 😑
Rip pig 2000 something to 2019 die by kids pushing hay into rat eater 🐷🐷
Pls upload more of this game like the days gone
Thank you so much for making these videos I enjoy watching them after a Long Day's work AKA I do not have a life just a Honda Civic with a turbo he he he he
This is the stuff of nightmares

Rat: squeak
Me: AHHH! DEVIL!!
Was anyone else yelling "RUN BRAD RUN!!!" after he put out that guards lantern and the rats attacked him?
This game is so intriguing idk if it’s the setting or how the games storyline goes. Like what is Hugo’s sickness why are people hunting him down?
You should try switching to the French dub, it's so much smoother and sounds more natural. The French voice actors did a wonderful job!
Clearly this game just likes killing animals for no reason🤷🏾‍♀️🙄
This game takes time during the Black Plague era, read the blackthorn key series, and you will know about this, the saltpeter and sulfur, the Black Plague, etc.
Brad:Hey,Hugo is forever running off man.
lol
Would love seeing this game finished out! Really enjoying this playthrough
Is there a specific schedule you upload every videos of you playing this game? I can’t wait!! 😅😊👍🏻👍🏻 Thank you
This video game really makes me appreciate my shower
Hugo: ask question
Amicia: we have no choice 
🤣
OMG!!! That shield Hugo picked up...it has the Lannister house sigil on it......BRAD, DID YOU SEE IT?!
Keep playing Brad, And yes finish the game!!!
I’m watching the video like GO BRAD LOL GOOOOOO PAST THE RATS LOL
destroy the like button but i couldn't like again. 
jst kidding...
So funny that brad felt so bad when he killed the pig but when he does it to the soldier he said it was necessary? Lmao great stuff brother!
Please upload more, I really enjoyed watching your gameplay in this game!
why cant the rats be cute like stewart little 😭😂
“The mice cheated! Look at that!”
Oh come on brad you’re so funny😂
13:08, 15:00 missed item on the right. 15:07 missed item on the left.
19:35 I was yelling the whole time lol. Run! Run Brad! Brad run! Come on Brad! I thought for sure it was a timed event I was facepalming lol.
Kaleesi help! Dragons Vs rats! Better than GOT😂😂
THANK God this isn't real 


FAMOUS LAST WORDS
Ayyyyyy first comment, been loving these games. Keep up the great work!
Brads genuine concern for Hugo gives me the feeling he’d be a good father :) 
Lol
20 minutes videos is to short for this game Brad.. IJS..love your videos
..cuz its a video game!!😂
I lost the flow of the event..
+ 1 subscriber😂
Wouldn't sticks burn slower when you pick more than one?
Please do 4 daily like you did days gone. Pretty please with a cherry on top. I'll throw in a chicken pork adobo! Hahaha. Much love from the Philippines!
Why is this video shorter? 😂 love your videos keep em coming I always watch your videos and eat something it’s my way of not eating popcorn 😂
Screaming that after blowing mans light and rats eating him.. "RUNN YOU DAMNED"
So it's basically a game where you search for lightable things and go along the story?
"We don't have a choice" - Amicia, 2019. 
Rest in peace wilbur, You will be missed.
I always watch your videos!! Please continue this game 😍😍😍
Hugo's voice is so cute 😍😍

Btw nice vid! Just subscribed here ✌
I'm a new-comer to your channel and these videos are what attracted me. Please do more!
Keep on doing this game i love it i want to know what happens next .
I love your channel

Glad you made another video. Excited for part 5 :D
I love this game so much. Don't stop 💖😂
Keep spaming Brad! :)
Will you play Borderlands 3 btw? It looks awesome. :D
Always 'A WAY OUT' its a video game haha
Such an easy game and this guy still doesn't know how to play.
Stop telling stuff before it happens lmaooo 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Too bad he couldn’t do the alchemy and save the damn pig...not a great apprentice Lucas 😭
Poor cliffhanger Brad!!!!

Also I think you missed something there to the left where you consigned that guy to the rats.
LETS GO ANOTHER VIDEO LOVE YA BRAD!!~!!!!!!1
I wouldn't play this game but I enjoy watching the game play. It's different from a lot of games.
The character voices should be better,the graphics are so cool but some details seems are just left unfinished!
Does the video kinda just abruptly end mid-sentence for anyone else? I smell a re-upload or double coming.
Oh wow I cant express how much Im loving this series, yet another game I NEED! Its like watching a movie watching you play; love this.
I love watching you game because I’m not a gamer and if I played this I’d be screaming at the rats every 5 seconds lol
I think your background music is off. Please turn it on bro...
Thanks Brad! Loving this series💜🐀
Me: I have nothing to do now
Brad: uploads
Me: How convenient!
Lordt haf Merci I have to wait now. I know you're still playing Days Gone and now Rage2, sigh I want the drama of this game more than Rage2
1 minute after upload and the vid has 20 like WoW.
ANOTHER EPISODE PLEEEAASSSSE, I SERIOUSLY KEEP REFRESHING JUST TO SEE THE NEXT ONE. KEEP GOING!!

Absolutely love this! One of my favorite game play vids .. besides Days Gone!!! Very entertaining
The way Brad talks to Hugo is so adorable. 😂😂😂
theradbrad I've been watching your vids for years can you give me some advice how to start a gaming channel like how you start yours
I LOVE THIS GAME, it feels like i go through these videos so quickly

YAAAAS FINALLY IM SO HAPPY KEEP EM COMING BRAD MUCH LOVE FROM TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA🥰🥰🥰
You can try the game in french with english subtitles to have local vibes 😊
Brad bro! Loving this! Can't thank you enough for your channel and these videos!!!
That part with the windmill was cool!
14:44, can you imagine the odor emanating from all of those rotting bodies?
The part 5 is still Raw..
Ill be waiting for it. XD
- Gordon Ramsey -
15:55 missed the other item in the chest as he turns and runs
Man, I dunno if I could handle taking care of a child. Especially Hugo. His whiny little voice, how he questions everything, he doesn't listen. I dunno if I could deal with all that. He's beyond annoying.
Your stealth is awesome. Keep uploading these great videos ✌️✌️ The Rad brad✌️✌️.You are the best.
They remind me of the South Park rats 🤣🤣🤣
Just do it, Brad. Keep it coming. I like the character . The game is interesting .
4:43 IT'S WAS THE ONLY WAY
Amicia almost went dr strange right there
Love when you spam amazing games. Keep it up Brad 🤟
I actually found your channel yesterday, watched the others in this series and I’m hooked. Keep it up you’re really fun to watch with gameplay, gained a new subscriber today!
Row row row your boat gently down the stream
somehow brad reminds me of lew from Unbox therapy...they are like siblings..😅😅
This might be the only game where sticks and stones are your bestfriends....
Can you play more of this game its super good spam us with videos like days gone
Rad Brag Why You Don't Post Videos Of this Game like Days Gone.. We have to wait Too Long For this Game Videos.
"There's always another way" - Dory
Brad: Uploads 4th part
Me: Finals Who???
This game is so fun! Keep working on it, bro!
Awww Brad is such a kind soul! He felt so bad for the pig.. I felt really bad too :((
Brad pleas make 2 eps a day or at lest a bit longer.
great game, I wish I could play it
This game is awesome. Keep playing it Brad!
He keeps calling it a puzzle. But the game tells you what to do so is it really a puzzle? (Shoot out the guys torch)
Brad: I really hope we don't kill the pig (sarcastic laugh) I really don't
When Lucas said his lantern I thought he meant kill him then take it
Your so kind to animals, I hope everyone is 😍
Liked and looking forward to the next one :)
Need more than one video a day. This game is pretty neat. And you get hooked fast.
Keep it up Brad! I don't normally comment...or ever comment but I've been enjoying your channel so much recently.  Keep this game up Brad it's so good!
The way  those rat's burst out of the corpse is like a Trojan horse
Brad you take forever to upload or  make the ones you have uploaded public. Making me have to go watch Tetraninja's walkthrough or somebody else's.... you should upload more frequently just for the sake of keeping your fans interested in your channel.. just imo though
This says 16 views and 28 likes?!? I'm not good at math but I like this series so I won't complain! 😅
"one of them cheated did you see that" rat runs under again " woo look at that" 😂
dam i like the video so much but i'm also playing it and i'm a bit behind...so i will watch it later..keep up the good work man
Keep the series coming. you are really Rad :D
I'm always coming back for more! What is next like goal for double upload?
can we all take a momen and appreciate the fact that this guy is uploading 3 different games at the same time
Keep it coming! This game is awesome!
Keep it up Brad!Appreciate  the hard work you're doing!
Its one hell of a game .... do upload the series .... lots of support from INDIA 🇮🇳 .. ❤️😊
How could you end it there!! Does that mean there's a part 5 soon?? lol
LMS if you want RADBRAD to take us through this journey!
makes me wonder did this really happen like the actual plauge
I think 15 Chapter or 16 Chapter in that game, I forgot haha....
I've been here for a while Brad, glad you're keeping up the top notch work man.
I want to see the next gameplay for this game RadBrad, let’s go!
Come on drop part 5 I want 2 videos a dat
What a game man keep it up brad finish this
I already watch the full walkthrough from another channel but this one is MORE ENTERTAINING because someone is talking here and it is like being played infront of you where error is inevitable, keep it coming!!
I absolutely love this series, please keep the series coming, waking up today and noticing that a new part was out was an amazing feeling
You're timing is impeccable brad as always!! I was just about to eat my munchies and what should I find in my sub box? A new episode of plague tale! cheers m8
4:46 I feel like there's another way and you will get extra points or maybe a treasure.

Why are 5-6 and 7 private????
Woah, the fly/mosquito sound at 13:14 makes me slap my ears although I wear headphones (that hurt my ears af). I hope the game doesn't end soon. Enjoyed the story and makes me nervous at the same time!  Thanks for this Brad!
Don’t end the video like that lol 😂 I thought my phone glitched. I forgive you just keep making more.
Brad is the best walkthrough gamer. Best commentary and humor
How come you pronounce the "r" in game of thrones different than the "r" in other words?
Better then netflix. your the best. D:)
Hit like who all are waiting for the next part5!😆
Looking forward to the rule 34 of this game.
Love to Brad for uploading this and actually listening to his audience (who likes it). Another great video!
Great job from this company.

Great video. As always the content is very funny when you commentary

Brad there's a new update on red dead redemption 2 online you can play as a bouty hunter,collecter or a trader
Make a vidio about it
Ah Alan wake games good times I hope they remastered the game.
Just got bored and wanted to go to sleep, but got the notification. HOW CONVINIENT! or unconvinient...
pls upload more of this game per day
I'm destroy that like button until rats will come after me
My favourite series by far. Please do more than one video a day. When its a puzzle game its more fun to watch Brad.
I love this serie, Brad, please keep playing!
Love this game so far! Keep em coming Brad 👌👌
I played  Alan wake on X360 i could not pass the game dental
This game looks amazing,,, definitely want to see more of it!
Might end up getting it myself too.
I'm already in ch7 it's awesome 😍😍💯💯💯❤️🔥
Yeah keep going man 👍😋🤗
Man you need to finish this game ASAP because it's fantastic more than Days Gone
I always feel bad for killing animals in games don't really care about NPC's though
Please do twice a day of this atleast. I really enjoy this series. Thanks for the content
Fantastic game! Reminds me of when you played God of War 4. Loved those videos too!
Brad Piper and the hordes of Zombie Rats.
The remind me of the dishonored rat plague
When you spend minutes just refreshing just to get the next episode. 😜😜
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER WAY! Poor pig, :.(......
Love coming back to a new plague tale episode ✨✨
Make the videos longer then 23mins or give up 2 or 3 videos a day
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS GAME!
Absolutely loving this! Keep it up :)
Yes please, Brad. More of this game. A full play through would be amazing. And personally, I really want to see where this story goes. After all, nobody expects the (Spanish) Inquisition! 
(Who knows what their chief weapon(s) are? XD)
Yesss multiple uploads a day would be awesome! I admittedly almost looked up a random full play through of this game last night because I’m so invested in the story already, but then I was like nawww who am I kiddin’? I gotta wait for my dude Brad😋
Hey man I believe this game is one of the you should finish! Game's storyline is great also gameplay too. I am sorry but I watched from other channels for a bit and I can easily say you will love this one and I know you already are + probably better than days gone. Anyway keep it up man.
Ps: I wanna watch your playing Brad and stopped watching since I saw your 2nd video about the game:)) and pls do more vids for a day :)))
Ive been waiting for this since 84 years brad 😋
Hugo actin like a lil BITOCH!

Poor piggie.   Please continue, Brad!
It's a Rats Apocalypse Brad.

Hey Brad, in the playlist on ur channel for this game says there are 7 videos but 3 of them are private what is that man?
Hey Brad would you mind if I borrow some of your subscribers lol?
please finish and upload more i love this game
MMMMMMMOOOORRRREEEEE also whoever dislikes is a uncultured swine.
You update, I watch. It's that simple.
One of them cheated, what can you except from a dirty rat. Lol

Keep them coming so i can keep up with days gone lol
I really like the theme of this kind of game,  i hope that you will continue playing this :)
Really love this series! Please keep it going
Rad hugo can controll the rats sooner in the game ahahah
If they made a movie about this i will definately NOT buying it.
Please keep on going Brad! Love from Spain
Love to see more of this
I just finish watching part 3, and i refresh the page and out of no where part 4 came!
Hey I have a theory that if Hugo is head is hurt I think that there is a rat with a plague nearby I THINK
plague in hebrew is 'dever', from the root word having to do with order. a plague is a re-ordering of the population
Thanos would took Care of those rats in mere seconds
I love u for making this a series

RadBrad is the king, baby yeah.
You had so many fans..😍😍
This is one of the great series played by the greatest of the Players.....  can't wait for the next one.....
Brad you're a little slow. But you're still cool.
I love this game a lot 😂 Hugo reminds me a lot of my little brother
Dope game, we want mooooore 😀
There alaways a way out when the vodeo is done 😭😭
Thank you for always providing amazing content! I’m getting into games I never would have thought twice about. Keep up the good work Brad!
Hi bro. I am a big fan of your gameplay and with your inspection I have started a channel. " bb_gamers " is my chanal name bro. Thanks for your inspiration and I love your gameplay a lot.
It's such an amazing but a dark game. It really explores the dark and emotional side of us. I mean, the part where the pig was sacrificed to clear the path to the laboratory, I mean, there was a battle going inside me when I was about to shoot at the 2nd light if I sacrifice the pig or quit playing the game. The game really tried to explore our emotional sides. I really really felt bad for the pig. And yes, there were several different ways of clearing a path without sacrificing the pig, but, it's how the game is designed.
Heck yes we want more! Keep em coming!!!
It would be funny if this was Game of the Year. lol
Will be here till the end, love this game.
"theres a rat in the kichen oh what im gonna do theres a rat in the kitchen oh what..."
The kid is so adorable cx
Seeing the pig get sacrificed was tough, he was just chilling in the back! Anyways AWESOME VIDEOS BRAD! Keep them coming. Let’s GET IT!!!!
Want more of this game. 💣💣💣
You should make it an hour not 20 min
Pleaseee do a full play-through for this one Brad there’s a lot of us that are really into the story!
Only thing that’s bothering me about this game

AI is blind

They haven’t eaten or slept in 24hrs n kids like 5? 

Game devs have no children apparently
I thought you said you read all the comments Brad steam shows this game a 9 out of 10
Fyi ign gave 7/10 on this game
Really Waiting For This ! 😂
How convenient, as I reach home from school!!!
Please finish it....its kike an eary kind of pleasant story to watch...love it.
IMMA WAIT FOR MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THANKS BRAD~ <3
Keep UPLOADING THIS :)
What's  the big deal with this game , i'm seeing  it everywhere  but i only see a woman running with a boy and throwing rocks to distract guards
10million subs for playing games? Damn you must be Hugh Hefner rich
YESH WE WANDZ!!!!!
I've been waiting allll DAY!!








Get to End of Video AHHH!!! Now I got to wait some more :(
Although I'm loving this series. Brad you should try making it so you post the content maybe every 2 days so the demand can be higher, sometimes it to much for me and I can lost interest for example days gone but I'm still catching up
Can you spam it like days gone?
Post more 💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️
Yes please finish the game its very intriguing
this game got me zinked
Finish the game all the way n make more videos
Finally i've been waiting for part 4
I think I would appreciate the rats more if instead of exploding out of the ground they obviously dug through the ground and that the rats seamed more random in coming out of the ground instead of obviously hearding the characters
im really loving this story like and the puzzles
So glad you uploaded I was hooked on the last episode and couldn’t wait to see more and you came through
Yes yes keep them coming.
O my all this rat's coming out of nowhere . Awesome content thanks  . Can't wait to what's next
We love the game man!! Keep em coming!!
I wanna buy this game. But i'll wait until the price drop
10 % here for the walkthrough, 90 % here because we can't afford it.
This game is sick keep playing it brad
Didn't asobo belong to thq before
Loving this game Brad.  More, more....
Keep going with this please Brad!!! Its so intriguing!!!
Alan Wake PTSD 🤣
You took so long to post this that I'm gonna watch someone else play this game

So far so good ;)
thank u brad!!!!!
Ur uploading too slow brad...l wanna stay loyal.
Hurry guys like the video so we can have more videos!!!! Thanks brad!!
0:11
More please!!! This is Fantastic!!!
You didn't play the final dlc for little nightmares
Hi, Brad ! I guess you don't like bacon !!...
Yeah I feel like you could have hurtled over that gate for a reason oh, maybe the pig could have lived
I am one of your days gone fam and started watching play this it is like a movie game so yea more videos
MOAR BRAD!!!!!
@theradbrad bro...i need part 5 asap
Please do multiple videos each day, that’s if you can
When I opened the video I hear a bunch of rats screeching
Please finish it. I want to watch this one through to the end
Is it me or what.. The video ended in a strange time. And no one noticed it??
Why couldn't they just have thrown fire in the middle of the rats instead of killing the pig?
these videos are too short i want more :(
Keep it coming fam ❤️
We obviously want more so please finish it🙏
Radbrads videos for this game just keep on getting better and better. This game is so morbid I like it. I know I have said it so many times already but Radbrad is a fantastic and entertaining YouTuber.
I can’t get enough keep pumping them
Keep em coming bradd
Dude, a part a day until this gets finished sounds perfect to me. That's because this seems like a game that's great when you're exploring other games as well, but a lot of the people in the comments here seem to want to see how this story ends. Days Gone was great for some of us because we loved the story, and those are the ones who are loving Plage Tale as much as I am. The story isn't as exciting as Days Gone, but it sure is damn beautiful and endearing. Keep em coming!
Amazing game!!!
MOREEEEE FASSTTT PLLSSS 😭
gimmmmee that part 5 man i need my fix
What a great game! Intense but great!
i really want a 1 hour video
I prefer Plague than Rage2... just my opinion.
13:06 the ground is covered of rocks
Sweet. Next part please Brad.
Lucas will be killed by Hugo
Yessss.  I've  been waiting!
This game gives me Game of Thrones vibes despite that I have never watched a single episode of it.
Is Lucas a child or am I being catfished
finsh please !! keep it up < 3<3
Yessss more than once a day! Lol
I have finished the game and the boy isn’t magical he is just sick Amicia has magical powers and she kills her brother after the game
I just finished the game. Just too good game
Please keep playing this game, it’s very interesting and something new all together
At some point it was an Arthur talking
I guarantee these vids won’t be coming thick and fast because he be using YouTube every 2 minutes looking how to get it done. The gameplay can be so confusing at times it’s crazy no maps, which I like might I add. Nice story nice change in pace.
Love the videos best gameplays I have seen
Lol. This video is incomplete 😂
PART 5 PLEASEEEEEEEEE!!
nice gameplay bro <3 <3
Yes! Amazing!!
This game is interesting love the vids
I was waiting for this finally
We love this game! Keep them coming 😍
i think i have a crush with AMICIA
I was trying super hard to remember the name of the game (Little Nightmares) yesterday because my friends said they liked unravel and I was about to suggest them this game but I forgot the name "little nightmares". Imagine my shock and surprise when you said the name of the game I was trying to remember!!
Brad you miss so much stuff lol
Just keep them coming brad spam it game is awesome
Pretty please finish it! ❤️❤️❤️
I seriously can't tell if the title is a sex joke
Love you to ;p :)
Come on man make the video at least  30 minutes
Does this game have a soundtrack or does radbrad edit it off for copyright purpose cause the game seems kinda boring without any music to add to the atmosphere lol. Its just like voices talking and then silence.
Awesome game so far more videos
wait, there is a chance that you don't finish the game?
Yayyy! Part 4!
This allows me to watch the story without having to play it for myself. This game really makes you feel.
Finally New upload 🙏🏽
NEXT VIDEO PLEASEEEE
I was waiting for this video to come
I just been wondering what's the number of likes u needed 2 continue and would u have left the ppl who liked it hanging if u hadn't reached it? Also where is the next video? I needs it!
The rats remind me of the scarab beetles in the mummy

IM SMASHING THE LIKE BUTTON
Boat scene but how the rats get thru the water in ratatouille 😂😉😭
spam accepted as always bro!
In the game when there running from the rats it looks like there jogging being slow
I'm hooked to this game cool videos 👌
There was a perfectly good ledge to climb up on and shimmy around, then climb to the loft, then climb over the railing and drop down next to the trap door.  Plenty of light there (4:12).  But the writers had other ideas it seems.  Let's see just how dark this all becomes.
Buying this game tomorrow,hooe it is worth it💖

15:34 I knew it!
Aye I just wanted to say i watch your youtube an its amazing keep doing what your doing. Sadly its a love hate thing because i love games an when ever you play a game i really want to try it just reminds me that I dont have that game nor a console to play it on like for example days gone. So far ive been watching your work since Infamous 2 i believe but only realized that I never sub to you but i did finally. Keep doing what your doing and you make me want to be a gamer even more i just wish i could afford it @theRadBrad
I'm curious as to why there are so many rats
This game sucks. Beautiful blond with cute French accent though.
Who here before a million VIEWS
Why did it have a absurd end
Part 5 😍
So the thing in Hugo cares not for good and evil but evolves with the host and it seems some deaths are avoidable maybe there could be different ending depending on if you choose to kill at every available opportunity or not since Hugo will be influenced by the player actions... Or maybe not.
Brad thanks for always supporting & commenting on my vids. I appreciate you man
Moar please mr brad man
More time in each video please brotha
This is a very interesting game.

SPOILER ALERT: Its a cool game. Hugo is the king of all the rats like he can get them to move out the way and attack the guards his sickness not a sickness his head hurt bc he can talk to the rats and he can control them but he dnt know it yet until the end. They save the mama which is still alive and kill the guy who wants to take Hugo blood and end of the game

Hey Brad, I don't know if you will see this but I wanted to tell you thank you. I have hit depression not long ago about university and had to drop out of it and my job too. So I found myself  with not much to do and no income. So thank you for all have you done. Thank you for cheering me up day to day and to allow me to experience this awesome game without being able to afford it. You give me something to look foward too everyday and it has really helped me so thank you so much and keep up the good work.
Hope you guys are having a great day! Much love and appreciate the support
Days gone still going strong. Yess. 😍 Thanks brad for keeping this game up.
You gotta finish the NERO storyline. You’re in for a real treat.
I promise. Crazy twist. Having to do with O’brian. He’s gonna tell you some crazy shit. Make sure you finish that storyline.
Sad this game is over will always be remembered thx for these wonderful videos brad!
0:01 You already know I gotta hit the like button before the video even starts
Nice !! Brad just post another one of Days gone !! clicking that like button  like a boss.
Was watching your old videos Ghost Recon and brought so much memories Brad❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can't believe im still seeing this.The game is good
I want to thank all the zombies who died in this game
So now use shotgun because you have that smp9. Shotgun, SMP9, and then sniper 50 cal. Perfect LOADOUT.
I can't wait for your reaction to O'Brien ending.
thanks brad keeping the days gone videos coming..   love it, like it.

ps4 exclusive is awesome
I can't get enough of your videos!!! Thanks for uploading after finishing the game!
Brad, my man. Haven't watched this yet, but if Sarah isn't in it, please show where she is and how Deek interacts with her
Man it was written in HINDI on the Iron Mike's redwood carved, wow
Bear. How convenient 
Brad. Hold my beer
If you people haven't watch Brad's 'Reacting to my older videos. ' video  then you should watch it.  It's really nice.
Upgrade👏your👏BIKEEEE👏In👏Iron mikes Camp👏 Brad 👏
Brad i luv ur vidoes, u are the best,  mch luv frm ghana 🇬🇭(africa)
Finished all 77 parts in 3 days damn bro you got me so addicted ♡♡
I think you should complete NERO missions first... brad.
Much love from Pakistan😍😍
Brad, if you finish the Nero with O Brian mission. There is a another ending which surprising
That 50 cal would easily pierce those helmets in the non video game world. Easily.
You pronounce Marauder like Martyr. Confused the hell out of me for a minute there lol.
That Hindu saying touched me, ill remember that.
Thanks Rad for everything.:)
8:32 it'll chug for a few seconds sometimes but other than that it's fine. (Mainly in camps very rarely on my bike even with all the speed upgrades)
I loved this series, thank you so much for your efforts 👍
more dude we want more we want the full 100%, how convinient ^^
WHY ARE THESE STILL ONKY 20 MIN VIDEOS? YOU FINISHED THE GAME BRO. LIKE YOU HARDLY DID ANYTHING IN THIS VIDEO!!!!!! THE FIRST 10 MINUTES IS NOTHING!!!!! THATS HALF THE VIDEO DUDE!!!! GODDAMN YOU'RE SLOW.
one thing I noticed in all your videos I haven't seen you use shotguns then again I could be wrong
You can suppress the sound of a 50 cal but it still won’t be silenced.
This series has been the best on YouTube by far brother!
Brad fails to make a jump.
Me: 😆😆🤣🤣🤣
@theradbrad Brad do u think it is worth it to get ps4 now or might as well wait for ps5.

 Really love ur video on days gone. 

Big fan of your from Indonesia
- You can go to hell !!!
* Already There.


True that.
I just had a dream about RadBrad uploading the 98th video for Days Gone, and I was like "I'm not even halfway through yet!" 😂
I think I’m getting addicted to yr vids 😂
@Theradbrad the bear made me jump and I kno I seen the snow moving😭😭😭
I have watched every video of this series! Truly addicting! Thanks for the great content!
Theres a secret ending with obrien

. Keep playing until he calls you
I really enjoyed this game ❗️❗️♥️ thank you Brad ! You the 🐐 🤘🏾
PLEASE KEEP UPLOADING THIS GAME PLS LUV U BRAD
When you find out Iron Mike was 78 years old when he died in game😱 damnnn
Love the series Brad! Keep it going, can't wait to see all the story lines finished! Can't afford to play all the new stuff so your channel rocks!
MUST HAVE MORE! Thanks for your dedication to this game!
There's bounty hunter on diamond lake. Russel call you earlier
Oh lord man I remember cypher 2 back before full walk throughs 😂😂 still love ya brad
my guess is that a potential DLC is helping Sarah find a cure for the virus
As I play all my games on PC I’m incredibly gutted not to play this, so I’ve loved every one of the 77 videos and hope you do carry on and post at least all the hoard take downs. Love your style and chat 😊👌🏻
hi Brad pls make all four endings of the game . . . you already made the IRON Mike ending and the one with the Ring there are two more,  so we hope there will be at least two more parts of this great GAME
I went out and bought the game and for a good five seconds I sat at the waiting screen and was surprised not to hear Brad’s voice saying “so guys, welcome back to more Days Gone.”
Dude, I’m absolutely loving the videos! You’re right when you said that when you become so involved in a game and when it’s over, you’ll feel like you’re missing something. Keep it up!
Upgrade your bike to diamond lake for beter upgrades. Not every camp has the same bike upgrades.
Please do more brad!! I enjoy watching you kill the hordes!!!
theradbrad you're still my top #1 favorite gamer in the world, i hope that means something to you, i've been trying to get that message to you for a long time,God bless you and your family.
Man good to see hindi in a foreign game ......awesome!?
Maybe if you kill the sniper..they will know you nearby..
Generally with a fifty cal, they combine a suppressor with special subsonic ammunition.
Pls keep it up Brad! I’m interested on how your going to tackle the diff hordes. I just wish you can craft a flamethrower! Also try a crossbow! Its interesting.
When I first seen the videos on YouTube I didn't want the game but once I seen your videos I want to play it. THANK YOU for what you did.
The frame rate on PS4 normal is a bit jankey when you come out of some camps. There's a few bad glitches too like not being able to access your ammo on the bike, but a reset fixes it.
I know resetting the game to fix the jank or being able to fully access your bike isn't great, but it's still a well done game with a lot of effort put in to it. And to be honest in my situation, I'd rather a fully fledged well built single player world with a couple of problems, than the usual generic built around online multilayer and microtransactions.
This game is SOOOO damn good, fam! 

Keep it coming!
Cant wait for you to play Ghost Recon- BreakPoint
This man just touch "yellow snow" i hope he realized that lol
@theRadBrad - the snow did move at 10:55 in the video - you aren't seeing things.  LOL
This game on ps4 slim runs ok, some lag spikes or frame drops happen but still playable
I think brads driving has improved because of this game
15:44 Man... That bear was dead before it even knew he got shot.
you should complete all the story lines......and knock off all the hordes.....go in 100%
So rikki IS Indian!!
Bcoz Patil is an Indian last name much love from India brad!
Oh the same...I died 😂 that was funny I played it back at least 5times
Brads laugh kills me

(WHEEeeze) HA Ha ha
I need a shirt that says, "Howconvenient!"
Why when arriving at iron mike camp, it was snowing in my game ?
Dude you really gotta finish that Nero quest. You won't be disappointed
hahaha, that grave 'stone". why would you write sth on it that only one person can read... logic
I just finished part 76 and now I get this notification!  

HOW CONVENIENT!  
Honestly I can keep watching brads days gone videos non stop
Great videos Brad, my kid and I enjoy them a lot! It's the best series you've done so far. 😎👍
10:15 is that a same bridge before that he just didn't make it?
This reminds me of Ellis from Left 4Dead2 where he tells his story 6:03
THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING THIS VEDIO. I WANT TO PLAY IT TOO BUT CANT
Heck yeah more vids. Thx Brad. Keep it up, love you bro
Keep them coming Brad! I’m loving it!
I played out this game in 4 days lmao. Worth it though.
Hey Brad I'm one of your oldest subscribers...I'm from India...So just wanna tell you that I can read the "Hindi" quotes on Iron Mike's tombstone...It feels really proud to have my mothertounge in this game...It's really a very good game...one of my favorite after Mafia ❤
I wanna se how all the missions end with u playing it for us brad tq... 😁
I watched this whole series and still bought the game and playing it now
Best YouTube entertainment goes to the radbrad🔥🤙🏻
Just keep uploading from this game, we get enthusiastic

Thanks for these Brad! Keep 'em comin'
You have to go see Russell, and the snow did drop

I bought DAYS GONE because if your videos. I’m having a blast.
Love seeing more Days Gone!  I hope you'll show off any DLC to us if/when it comes out as well; I always wanna see more of this :D  Thanks again, Brad!
Marauders = Muh-RAW-ders, my man.
Really good game, wish it was on xbox
.50 Cal bmg is such an impressive cartridge. It would only take one shot to drop a bear in real life
There are still couple more endings: one for Lisa and one for Nero, just wait a couple of in game days!
More more more Brad!!!
Loving this series and thank you again for all your efforts x
Love from India, please keep on playing this game.
yeah!! more of it, but  i couldn't see it on time, youtube showed me a notification of the upload, but meh there was no video showing up!! i guess YouTube is DRUNK again!
Do the NERO ending, man. It'll blow your mind...
What a great game. So much going on, and it keeps you coming back.... holy shit, bring on the DLC next adventure, or make your own character play!!!!! Damn good job on this one!
The snow did move down, like it was melting.

Thanks brad for keeping this game up.!
Thanks brad for keeping this game up.!
Thanks brad for keeping this game up.!
Thanks brad for keeping this game up.!
Hey Brad just go to O'brian because there is a secret ending
I love, and enjoy, and like this series so much my friend, keep up the great work Brad!
Put a front fender and face shield on your bike bro. Keep the vids coming.
I am really glad that you decided to continue videos on this game. THANK YOU!
I looked around, and it looks like there are still some cut scenes to be unlocked with different people you haven't seen in awhile. 
Again. THANK YOU! Wish I could play this game, it looks like so much fun
i made it here. hehehe 5 days of watching... great job.
I'd like to see Prison Mike's storyline in all of this
You might as well upgrade your bike. We like to see its  speed
Man please make the diamond play button video!
Please!🙇‍♂️
Go one my dude. We want to see  Part 90 at least :D
Are you avoiding those HORDES ???/
Please do the There’s Nothing You Can Do secret mission ;)
This game was great your commentary made it better😊. Its hard to say goodbye to it.
Thanks for posting more of this game,  hopefully we can get a little bit of it each day. I know I can't get enough
been so bored all day and my teacher gave us time to do an assignment i finished so i go to youtube....new days gone video how convenient
Eagerly waiting for A plague tale innocence ...🔥🔥
probably my favorite game you’ve played this brad
A Plague Tale, Rage 2... keep it coming!
Great vid again Brad. I'm loving this game, init m8. 
For me I think game of the year will be Last of Us 2. Every gamer is hyped real bad over this game. PlayStation & Xbox are going to enjoy it even if they can only watch u. 
Anyways long message Brad take it easy can't wait for the next episode m8.
Post Videos a Little More Often Man.. I'm Not getting Time to Watch
Damn its 2am in Australia, was about to sleep 🤔  butttt nevermind...
I’d like to see the bike totally upgraded in some future video :) super glad there are more videos even after the main story ended
Eyyyy sarge survives man. I’m glad he didn’t die in the attack.
I haven't been able to find your channel in around a year or 2. I use to always watch you and today you just popped up in my recommended, good to see your still alive lol
Finish lisa history fam you get a nice cutscene 😎😎
Yeah loving this game forever and ever until no one plays and the end of the world hell yeahh brad🤘
You should try to get the final o'Brian cutscene too. It is pretty interesting.
plss do some side staff on this game brad plsss
Right when i said your not making that jump 😵
Lmfao he keep getting wrecked by that same Bridge
Liked and looking forward to the next one!
Keep it going . Love you brad ❤
There are defo frame rates on PS4 especially when you upgrade your bike
Please....play all the incomplete mission and stories ....i really love it brad😍
Been with you since day one brad!! Thanks for all the great content.
I feel like Dying Light 2 could become game of the year
YES! It's good to be here, thanks brad
That Blaire merchant wants some Deek action.
I love this game!!!! Keep it coming Brad
You should max out the bike before the end of the series brad
this or resident evil are my front runners for game of the year.
Make a video of your fully upgraded bike
Wow they actually used Hindi , for it and that also correct 
Impressive
I'm surprised how much I loved watching you play this game. Keep up the good work Brad. 👍
Given that Deek should have been HELLA infected by now given how often he deals with freakers... my guess is that HE and the other non-NERO survivors are a small subset of humanity w/a natural immunity (like in that TNT show “The Last Ship”).

As for NERO personnel, their still alive because of the hazmat suits.

Also, my two cents... I don’t think these are the living dead types of zombies. If anything, I think they just appeared dead while their bodies were being mutated. This looks like a science made problem, not supernatural.
yes brad yes it did move i just rewind it 4 times just to dubble check wow
keep going
and mmaybe bring back some sekiro
Days gone definitely goes down in my top 10 Brad's walkthroughs that I've watched I think it's somewhere around 4-5

The #1 will always be The last of us though it's something special altogether
Thank you for still going on with this series, can’t wait to see what you have in store for us! So pumped
finish the o'brian storyline the ending will make you go wtf!?
Brad I want you to play ghost recon breakpoint
Thanks, Brad. what happened to Lisa? Please continue the Lisa Storyline
You should use different weapons whice you never used.
Love from the Philippines Brad! ❤❤❤
I don't believe that this game received mixed/average Reviews (from Wikipedia) I think it's perfect. Yes there may be scope for improvement but I would give this a solid 4/5 definitely would recommended it
Brad has completely forgotten about the use of rocks and distraction
Another glitch. The matraas in the hindu script of Iron mike's tomb are pretty messed up!.
Keep going till 💯, you're doing grate
Thanks radbrad. After watching you fight that mini hoard I decided to fight a couple. After the mill hoard I was like I'm not fucking with them but it was actually pretty fun. Love your videos and this game is awesome
Watched all of the videos ... As usual your voice is amazing....
Kindly go to the Nero island... ;)
The snow definatly moved lol
Bro go see manny I wonder if he has anything to say after you saved his life
Really love your works,Brad! But i need more Plague!
You should visit Sara.  I mean they dident see each other more then 2 years, visit her man! 😘
Also, finish Nero part
Best gaming channel on youtube and u r very humble brad
just continue to post some of videos of this man.
I think the virus is based off your immune system, if you had a weak immune system, you’ll turn, if you have a strong immune system, like the survivors you’d live. Instead of being infected, you’ll be eaten.
We know it is too much work for you probably... but we really need everything at 100% complete ❤️

Thanks a lot
Hope u post 100% of this, imma watch it till the very end
How convinient, I´ve been following from ep 1 and I´m still around. Please continue with these episodes, it´s the highlight of my day :) Cheers
When this series totally ends,  I'm gonna miss it a lot.  Helluva game
complete all side stories when you do that you’ll get a radio call from O’Brian the call will trigger a storyline titled “There’s Nothing You Can Do”  TRUST ME THE ENDING CUTSCENE IS WORTH IT you will see what happens to O’Brian
Please try to complete Finding Nero
damn, can't wait for you to see the o'brian ending. that'll tie up a lotta loose ends 😂😂
Do and finish the NERO storyline and then something crazy sh*t will happen :>
Man your the best keeper the videos...!!
Thank you for still giving us the story.
Ive completed surviving isnt living but the decal wont come up any help on how to get it?
Should i get this? I love zombies but a game like this with all the survival and stuff isnt my speciality.
I think ghost recon breakpoint might be the other game of the year
Hey radbrad use a shotgun in ur next vid
Love this game so much! Can't wait for the O'brian ending!
Keep the vids coming Brad.  Awesome
I swear if you were to post 50 more videos of just side stuff for this game i would watch every second of it!
keep up the good work brad
Cant wait for days gone 2 just because the content of this game and well the warning of Obrian about whats coming is more than interesting!
Brad please keep uploading days gone gameplay😊 its very sad the game ended😭😖😔😞 i kinna feel very sad nd bored not seeing further uploads but still this one made my day!😁😁😘 keep posting man ONE LOVE😘
Been a long time since you said
Easy does it

I can't wait for you to get the last mission with Nero you're going to like it.
Hey brad finding nero ending is the best you should check that out
The last of us 2 will be the game of the year if it comes out this year
Brad max out your bike at Diamond Lake..you didn't max out your oil tank, add the body upgrades and the tank tyres..with those you can run down those big zombies..
Pls use shotguns rad you never use it im waiting
That Hindi proverb/poem had quite a few spelling mistakes.
Pleas do more of Horde killing❤️❤️👍👍👍
2 more side engings to get, Will be expecting those on this chanell
I want my 50 cal back brad 😂😂😂
YO BRAD GOT THE SECRET ENDING.

Thanks bro for the game expect new ones too
Pleas try to upgrade the bike 🏍 Brad
I watched every episode as you released them, been an amazing series and it makes me wanna buy a ps 4 just for this game
Upload more. Its amazing!
Days gone definitely goes down in my top 10 Brad's walkthroughs that I've watched I think it's somewhere around 4-5
The#1 will always be The last of us though
Keep it going brad =) doing good!
10:55 ITS ALIIIIIVE 😂😂
So here I was like: Brad there's a bear behind you.
Marauders 
Muh raw ders 
That being said, thanks for the videos.
14:53


When you missed the first shot you shot the house. You can see the bullet hole. Cool
Complete nero ending its legit  bro
Keep on playing the game there is another ending that u didn’t get yet so keep on playing
I was respectfully lurking..... waiting for a new video from you Brad... even though I have my notification turned on... LOL
Brother waiting for plague tale ... upload it soon !!
Try to max out the bike
Thanks for the Day Gone vid today.  It'd be great to see all the story lines finished.
The zombies was created by sarah in the lab if you remember in cloverdale then that patient transmitted it to few more where they went home coz they got sick
"9:23"There "NOT" Zombies, there Freakers. If they were zombies, a person should have gone bitten by it and becomes a zombie. But it didn't happen.

To me: These Freakers reminds me a movie called "I Am Legend 2007 Starting Will Smith". A surviving scientist will trying to find a cure to stop the infected people.
The freaks don't look like they've been eaten thay look more like dryed raw chiken
Hey I like to watch A Plague tale more than daya gone
50 cal sniper ftw.  The Chunk machine gun with built in silencer FTW.
Hey theradbrad.
Finding Nero Storyline's last mission and some people's call it the "Secret Ending" and I had a question...
Why is O'Brian is not ok in that mission?

To unlock it  lol
hey Brad, can you show us where is Sarah now? i wanna see her together with Deacon after all the Bad stuffs happened.
aw man i thought you were gna take on a horde on this video smh
After u finish the game I will have one last meeting with o`brain
Think this is the best apocalyptic game of all time. Better than the last of us imo.
I don't want this series to end, Brad 😢 It's too good
Any way to get back to the old zones with Tucker and Copeland?
i want another video of days gone bring us more
Aye brad why are the next videos private
Brad, really enjoyed this play through & loved following the story. If it wasn't for your uploads, I'd have read the reviews & would probably have decided not to buy a copy, such was the negativity on release. I'm half way through the storyline & thoroughly enjoying it. Cheers for your videos, first class as always.
Brad are u planning to continue rage 2
Love from pakistan😍
we need a 1 horde per video kinda thing happening
Hey Bro just a side note.  any bullet traveling faster than 1126 feet per second is going to create a sonic boom. That's why the 50 and mostly all riflecalibers can't be "silenced". The reason suppressores are used on rifles is that the enemies can hear the crack of the sonic boom, but the direction the shot came from is almost impossible to pinpoint. 
   Pistols with a mussle velosity less than 1126 fps are pretty damn quiet although the cycling of the action is fairly loud.  
  When you were playing Elite Sniper (I think) WWII game I believe. The Welrod pistol was the ultimate in hush hush bang bang because you had to manualy cycle the action each time you shot and the mussel Velosity was well below 1000 fps. A true silent killer but with very limited range. Since there is no action cycling the shot is sneaky deeky quite compared to a semi auto pistol.  
  There is a hellava lot more details ans such that goes into suppressing firearms , and people alot smarter than me can explain it better but I thought you might like to know.---Side note a Supressed Desert Eagle is still going to make alot of noise....
  Take care and keep up the great work.


V/R


D.W. Phiillips
Yo man you should do the infestation storyline.
A Days Gone video! My favourite time of day :)
Thanks for another part brad keep up the great work 💪👍
i saw the snow move to your not going crazy alone brother.
This game is insane 💚💚💞😍💚💚
I want to see the ending of lisas storyline!
Could you please finish the infestation and Horde stuff.
There will be 2 more endings like this.... o'brians and that ripper grils ending
wow i could not believe how fast those hoards got you no i thought you were dead but not you you kicked ass again. thanks for some more it mad my day i also been watching you play rage 2 what do you think of the game. bobby. also any of days gone you do i want to see so here is some love for being the best of the best.
Hi I want the game to be completed fully
Pls man keep playing this game on   your channel
brad can you please try out different weapons each video? makes it more enjoyable to watch instead of the same weapon for the whole series
Please make more, like upgrading stuff
There are multiple endings that you can complete
Gawd I really want this game
Brad if you actually did the side missions before you beat the game you are had all the extra perks of the guns and stuff
I'm grateful you played this game Brad, I like that you even play it for people who can't play it themselves. you should also check out the finding nero mission and talk to O'brian, I think he confirms  that there will be sequel of Days gone down the road
...Hindu language..😍😍.
Yo ur eyes are the eyes of god like how much can u play
I remember when it was ep1
The snow did move slightly Brad
you can basically take out anything in 1 to 2 blast with liberator
Is it just me or does any of the people watching not own a ps4 but still enjoy watching brads walkthrough?
Brad doesnt know yet :>
The game is not end man all story are not over please do all of it I wait to watch it
Great Video! There is more endindings then just 2 or 3! I just wanted to tell you. Dont wanna spoil anything.
More Days Gone makes me happy!
Thank you very much, Brad.
Frame rate was fine on a normal ps4 I had no problems
That's all for days gone but waiting for more content on A Plague Tale : Innocence...the game is good but unfortunately don't have enough money to buy it :'(
Remember when you go camping make sure you also bring your 50 cal just in case of a bear
i think it's time to see the face of Theradbrad,  im gonna head  out to instagram and chek him out
Yeah something I been wondering too, do you get bitten and turn or how do that work lol
Definitely want more of that
More HOARD VIDEOS
More Pls! !!
please do more videos of  a plague game its really awesome
Dude before you go take on the sworms you shold stop at the NERO locations to loot up to craft the explosives
I wanted to say thank you so much for this entire series. I have truly enjoyed all of your videos but this one in particular even more. I am a Xbox player so I will most likely never play the game. With your videos, this allows me to watch the footage. Keep up the good work.
We want MOREE!!    You are the best brad
There is 3 more endings in the game one with nero, iron Mike and at wizard island
It's pronounced Ma-rod-ders not martyrs. Mar-ters
We are now same weapon use :)
Full auto shotgun against a horde please😂
LETS GO RAD 100% IS NEAR!
This is my first notification of the day wow
Even though no wifi I am seeing this with my mobile data 
This is how much I like u man u r the best
Keep up 👍👍👍
Funny how people of this game grow on you eh?
Out of movie and entertainment, well
Radbrad's here
Pls Brad do more of this game
I love this game :) Please more
Brad i love this game please do more
at last...i was waiting for this for h and h...i like you man...nice player...awsome game...please more videos..come on..love ya!
brad get the liberator its the best weapon
Brad, I'm just going to put this straight. You're the best youtuber to ever exist.
please more episodes of the plague ;c
That proverb in Hindi is actually totally accurate. Love it when that happens.
Hey brad hopefully you see this but Garvin (one of the head ppl who made this game) recently said that they just might possible bring back syphon filter because of how good Days Gone did. If they do, would be dope af to see you play it
The side arm is just like a primary
Cause high damage
Try a stealth horde. Hide in the bushes and throw attractors then bombs/moltovs etc.
I really dont get the ooint of this game !
Upgrade the hell outta that thing
Brad i think you can get the old gas thingy back in cope lands camp the one that deeks wife give him  i just. Think donno if its true
Sweeeet👌👍
Brad doesn’t pay attention to the weapon conditions 😂 that’s why you unlock it later, it’s in better condition and has higher stats
Just wait tell you see the Nero ending
NIGEL ADKINS, WE'VE GOT!
The game of the year wont be this it will be something that reviewers love so probably Last of US 2
Check out the gas tanks at Copeland’s Camp, I believe your custom fuel tank is their (the one Sarah made you before outbreak)
Hell yes!!
Deacon: Gotta find Sarah, I believe she's alive. All hope is lost, I think she's dead. A new hope, she might be alive! FINALLY FOUND HER! SHE'S ALIVE! Some bastard locked her up inside a mountain, gotta save her! Yush, I saved her.
Story ends... Sarah who? I've got freakers to kill.

Also for game of the year. IF it doesn't get delayed to 2020, it'll go to Borderlands 3. 99,99% sure about it.
Yes, people have been waiting a long while for other games too. But we (Borderlands fans) have been waiting for Borderlands 3 the second Borderlands 2 ended. And no, the Pre-Sequal didn't count, it didn't quench the BL thrist. Just the teaser at the end of BL2 with the hologram showing multiple Vaults across a universe has wanted us for technology to reach a point where it would've been capable to be made. And that time has come.
wait a gosh darn minute brad did this already
Hey Brad, are there any hordes that would follow you back to any of your bases??
BRAD ooofed that deer.
MMMMOOOORREEE!!!!
Hey Brad great game please finish everything for those of us that can not play it.  We will all be waiting.  Thanks again for the great videos
It’s official, Days Gone is the longest play through besides GTAV on this channel.
the chicago uses .45 caliber ammo like the 911 pistol
More Rage 2 please!!  Long time viewer!
Hahahahaha this game is long even if its ended
If the last of us even gets announced that its coming out this year... its the game of the next 5 years for me
I have a reg ps4 frame rate is ok.. It does bog down every now and again.
More side stop please brad enjoyed this game
10:54 Yes,snow moved down from a mountain,with a sound.Interesting... Hmmm.
O’brain... why didn’t you tell us abou the virus:( HE IS One of them! But still human... jumps like 5 meter up, to a flying hely
Cribbage King Mike
Cutscenes after storyline are to be worshipped
Please play more ! Loving it
Yes!yes!yes! More please Brad  😊
small spoiler, you will see O'Brian again
MORE MORE MORE MORE! hahahaha

“How convenient”... love it
Welp. 77 episodes straight. Havnt slept in a while. I always knew of Brad, never considered myself a fan. Dont even really like walkthroughs or let's plays if I'm being honest. But I dont own a playstation and I fell in love with this game from another youtuber who posted it. So thank you. I fell in love with the characters, became invested in the story. Things I got to experience because of this let's play. So thank you! You've earned a subscriber, and it only took you 77 episodes of content to get me.
Keep em coming brad
brad do the nero project story
I hope day's gone 2 will come
Finally those words that I long to hear..."So guys welcome back to more days gone!"❤
Maybe the Nero storyline can answer your questions over the zombies brad.

omg please use other guns try them out you keep saying im going to use the crossbow and you have never used it you shot it 3 time and hit nothing try it it  would be nice to see other guns in use and also try useing some of your other items like remote booms mines stuff like that you know place them down befor you start shooting up the place id like to see some of the rifles even some shotguns being used and for the love of god please stop useing supressers  when you have already been seen take them off if they see u no point in useing it so take it off  iv watched every video so far and you are not trying out the wepons that are avalible in the game it seems like theres lots your not trying out 
you used the crossbow for for one job shot it 3 or 4 times and if i remember you hit nothing ad changed it and keep saying im going to used it and never do just use something new
Part77 wow
Awesome video RadBrad 😁
I heard that they have a secret ending
try Minecraft survival
When Brad turned around and saw the bear I jumped even though I knew the bear was there.
Playing on regular PS4 and I get frame rate drops all the time, but the game is worth it. Wish they would do a patch though.
Hey Bro hate to say it but this is my favorite series that you have produced, hands down...... Although I did watch "the Last of US" twice....... So hard to wait for Last of Us two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait, can't wait.  Keep up the great work that you do my friend.
Upload some more
This game is getting so longg
Upgrade bike to full
More videos plz
Don’t know what you be watching right now
495 views
This game reminds me of mad max game
Frame rate on an original PS4 gets kinda laggy when there is alot going on, or when hordes are moving in. Other then that it's fine for me.
Waiting for more days gone
DAYS GONE!!! Lets GO BOYS!!
Thanks brad
That snow did move.
Keep them coming Brad!
11:35
Yessss
Awsome gameplay
Play life is strange 2 Plzzzz

Please keep making these
I hoping for some more rage 2
Rage part 3
Go to Tucker
Do the Nero mission
5:18 there's a mistake in the last line it should be। जिए not as it is written on that board...
!.7k against 17, hey Brad, your winning, my man :-)
I was hoping you got the full ending cutscene when you beat the game. But the one you got was ok.
10:55 the snow did move
Yellow Snow Kappa
Dont know if you found out yet or anyone mentioned it but if you don't have any molotoves you can place a gas can infront of a nest and shoot it
Do more hordes please
❤️💞💖💖💗💗💘💓😍🥰❣️💕
More Please.
Notice me

That headstone tho!
Hello brad
the snow did move brad... o.o
Epic
So mike dies?
I dont see this game winning game of the year, unless every other game that releases is bad.

The games good just not game of the year good 🤷‍♂️
Days gone story line yey thanks brad
NICEE
Love thisssss
My guess is anyone who is still alive now is immune to the virus? It kinda seems like the only way for them to explain why no one ever "turns" into one of the Freaks.
the found nero mission is not done yet we miss some  cut scenes
I like this game
sweet
___-
Nice!
Complete it!
A PLAGUE TALE PLEASEEE....
Hi brad
Hi
Another Great Video!!!!!!!!!!!
Please play red dead redemption online new update please
indian dev. sent a easter egg at last
Just a doubt....how the hell are you playing this much games ..who else thought this way......
and i beleave that zombies is a copy right so othetr shows games ext can not use the term zombies so walkers freakers what ever there being called is because they cant call them zombies  due to a posibule copy right law stating that on one can use the term so they have to call them something diffrent  like the birthday song is copyright so resteraunt cant sing it but io beleave that that copy right is not active any more
Awesome
NICE
Mooooore
11:43 Brad is waiting for the image to pull down her pants.
oh
💗 💗 💗 💗 💗 channel is very good
Are you on reddit radbrad?
Caleb is my name no joke
How about the auto shotgun try it
Use the liberator it’s nasty
Brad you are right you don't see anyone change in this game, its not even straight on how the Disease is passed. Deacon like everyone seems immune to it hell Deacon goes into a nest and caves fill with shit and piss from the afflicted and yet never seems to catch it. they don't even go into if its spread by a bite because the freakers always eat people completely
What does deselect mean? Don't they mean select?
I've heard there is a secret ending, can you find it?
Who is Bosco ?
When you end the world's end story line you will get a cut seen with obrain
Try to not make sound
BRAD!!! STOP THIS.. WE NEED THE PLAGUE INNOCENT!!! NEED MORE OF THAT..

I'M TIRED OF THIS GAME.. PLEASE..

MORE PLAGUE VIDEOS. 😭😭😭
Oh shit stop playing this,  play New game man and chatfacap wen you playing,
I thought it was the end before I saw this video!


HOW CONVENIENT
Appreciate all the support on this series so far. I haven't planned on doing a full series but we shall see! Much love to all of you
Do the Whole game brad! I like the gameplay of this one. You should try it on Hard.
Hey Brad, I am enjoying this, and I know I'm not alone!!! 


Keep it up and crank out MORE!!
The main menu looks like Far Cry New Dawn 
The driving looks like Mad Max
The gunplay looks like Doom & Wolfenstein
The goofiness looks like Saints Row
that was a fun part lets hope you play it to the end.
Hey theRedBrad the blue icons on your map are arks. They have guns and abilities. Check them out
I'm getting a Saints Row and Mad Max vibe. I'm loving it. Keep playing.
This game is pretty good but they could have really used some cutscenes for the dialogue. Having the characters just stand there is plain awkward.
Keep it up Brad loving the game !
killing dwarfs at circuit
"This is serious borderlands i think"
8.41 rage 2 : no option 
swtor: dark side  killed the person and go in lol.
Wellspring reminds me a lot of Sanctuary from Borderlands 2
Just wait for DOOM Eternal I think that's going to be really good!!
theRadBrad is awesome!! He is a huge inspiration behind creating my own channel. Thank you Brad for the hours and hours of entertainment. Cheers from Maine!!!
I have unfortunately become addicted to rads play through on this exclusively lol. Please more, these are rad brad.
Looks like a mix of Borderlands and Far Cry: Blood Dragon.
I loved the first rage and i just ordered this one,looks great
Was late on the first part and then got blessed with another right after.. amazing
Thank you TheRadBrad for posting another part for Rage 2. Keep up the hard work!
I was about to say mix of borderlands and saints row 5 engine remembers me the drifting as well but I heard it later and I was like shi# got it xd but damn the ending xd
Always enjoy your vids thanks, mate. ive just got rage 2. on pc. just installing it right now.  got those butterflies in my belly :) i love getting new games.
One day... I'll be on your level with YouTube. You truly are motivating me with every video... For years!  I appreciate your dedication bro!
Upload part 3 of Rage 2 next.
Porque no registras bien las zonas? Solo haces la misión obviando todos los materiales que puedes recoger para comprar en las tiendas. 🤷‍♂️
How is the winner of the games being given away announced?
It was Finks Arena in Borderlands 2 it was in the ice area The Fridge
When brad says that the game is sick you should buy it
Hey, if you're reading this...
Keep it going man! Great work.
Loving this series so far Brad keep em coming 🤗🙏
Idk but I feel like watching rage 1 when you did it
Please playthrough the entire game? I need a kickass shooter to hold me over until Borderlands 3
Idk how I feel about it. I played it for an hour or 2 yesterday and it felt kind of bland. Minus the combat... The gunplay is good. But thats about it. Idk well see what happens ima try it again today
Once you out of ammo. Switch to the shot gun. Then your side arm! Remember that! Don't ever reload while being shot at.
Thankq dude for ur hard work. Ur spending more time for us to make us happy. Soo really thankq soo much. Ur the man for the gameplay. Love u dude.
The character you're thinking of is prof.genki
I cant wait for dead rising 5 just a. Nice game 
And yes do more rage 2 
Do the whole game
id say boarder lands and titanfall -giant robots kinda
keep cracking them out but not as often as days gone bc I couldn't watch the whole series bc I couldn't keep up
6.7k likes 81 dislikes brad just think
Thank you Brad's other story starting😍😍
Enjoying this series so far keep it up with more of this! 

How Convenient  😁
Part 2 already..... Let's a go
Tnx for making another episode 😀really exited for this game
Hey Brad, the graphics look insane and Im only watching 1080p .....how is it on the ps4 pro in 4k HDR ? cheers
It feels as if, just last month you was at 1mil
I haven't seen that much neon hot pink since the 80's.
Do the whole game.
"I really love this game and been waiting for it." "I didn't plan on doing a series of this." Dang cuz, you a lie!
I never understand why in all the gameplay you are in such a rush and say things like if I have time? I would love to see this in its entirety and enjoy watching you play 😊
I watched the first part and thought hmm i don't know if i want to buy this game at all or even watch it but after watching the second part my opinion has changed and i'll defiantly buy it :P really enjoying it so far!
The mask (if I remember correctly) is the original mutant bash tv host
Keep it up i really like this game and would love to see more <3
Hey brad do a full Walkthrough I just hope this game comes out for the switch
You should do a full series for this game
I enjoy your videos but this game is very underwhelming. I expected better. I'm glad I didn't buy it.
This looks like fallout 4 and border land mixed together
Just always waiting and checking back for more Days Gone, LOL
Dear Brad I have seen your Brad unleashed videos....pls upload more like that....
Mix of mad max world and borderlands this is fun
As someone who can't afford to buy AAA games, i really appreciate the content you make  because it's the only way i get to enjoy video games , please keep this series going
I'm thoroughly enjoying this, tempted to get myself a copy, looks amazingly fun!
Roses a red violets are blue make this like button blue
👍
YouTube needs to fix there notifications because I should be getting all ur videos anyway it’s ok let’s gooo🔥👏🏻
It has that care free feel of Borderlands & Saints Row
Looooove it brad keep rage 2 coming!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would love to win this game man. I have tried a thousand times and it just doesn't happen for me.
You welcome keep doing your thing bro 💪💯
I REALLY want this. 


It never ends :D
This is like a cross between Borderlands and Bulletstorm
I got that for only $2500
i was waiting for this question brad how big is the map compare to Days gone ?
You should watch your play through of the first one so you can recognize the characters that are older in this. Other than that love your videos keep em coming.
You should play sniper elite v2 remastered
Waking up to this IS the BEST! YAY :) SO Happy! Thanks Brad..
@TheRadBrad - You were thinking of professor genki challenges in the saints row series and yaya, they were fun as hell as well! :)
Keep em comeing Brad this game looks sick especially on pc might end up getting this 😎👌🎮
It’s really like doom in mad max Universum
Love your videos keep up the good work by the way make sure to check out the alternate endings of days gone trust me you'll love them and there's a surprise in there that may tell you something big is coming
That arena you’re thinking about from Borderlands 2 is the coliseum in the Badass Crater Of Badassitude from Torgues Campaign Of Carnage.
Is this game out? Because it says pre-order when I try to buy it nevermind lol
THE NOSTALGIA OF WELLSPRING
This is Borderlands with Mad Max (you just don't have to eat maggots to live)
This game is like if DOOM and borderlands had a badass midget psycho
Game looks amazing, love your work Brad.
I want to see your reaction for the ending scene with o'brien 😮
I found you on my birthday in 2012 April 16th
you shold do you the hole game i love watching you play it keep it up man
In my opinion brad is the best youtuber on this earth
16:52-19:06 if u don’t want to b scarred then skip this
I found ur channel  when u started playing saint rows
Do more Brad! Please! The hype will come once everyone sees how good and fun the game actually is. It has redeemed itself and it will take a while before people catch on.
Your aim tho brad 😂😂 but keep it up part 3
I found your channel when you started doin days gone. I was hooked . You're awesome mate.
I was waiting for this video love your content.
Keep playing Rage2. Loved it so far
Hey Brad Love From India Please Keep posting the Walkthroughs They are So Much Fun
I am enjoying watching you ay. This game is enjoyable.
Definitely upload the whole game. The first episode alone was gnarly.
Brad I agree with quantum 6
The arena part kinda remind me of Farcry 4 where you fight in a similar situation
I think u should bc I’m debating on getting it and I love your walkthroughs
Do a full playthrough this is a very good game.
just finished the first vid! keep up the good work!
The Masks remind me of JK Stiles of the First Rage game
please do the whole series .Sire Brad kindly!
Brad I want you to play ghost recon breakpoint
I love this series so far I even stayed with the days gone series thank you for what you do I’ve been watching your channel for a while
Do more of this game it is amazing
Ohhh no I forgot about this channel after the grand theft walk through 😪 glad I’m back 👌 ur driving still sucks tho 😂
I'm like this series still
Can wait to see you with al the guns and abilities
I cant beleive how much this game is amazing
I loved part one hope you keep up the work. I just subscribed in part one.
Loosum was the first girl you spoke to in the first Rage game
Should be a multiplayer in this game !
Get sidetracked, that's the fun of the game. Visit some arks, and other side missions
I found your channel when titan fall 2 came out and i was thinking of buying it way to late lol
We want diamond play button review......
we enjoy every game u play brad, u should do the whole game!
Hey Brad u still thinking of days gone
This game reminds me of mad max and doom mainly because the companies that made those two games made this one
Hey bud love your gamplay I watch you when I don't wanna buy said game or don't have a PlayStation I love this series I hope you keep going to been if it's only when you got extra time
the saints row reference you aer thinking about was named gats fun time murder show game looks fun the shooting is also fun.
Its like borderlands with HD graphics
Remember when loosum hagar was hot back in Rage 1?
Finish this game , you have that habbit of finishing lousy games while abandoning good games 🤨
I like turtles and the game plz like I’m desperate
Yo this game seems op my verdict will be 7.5
I thought the video title was “Lossum Possum”
Why does this remind me of a new version of far cry 3 blood dragon
I really need to see ur face bro, Iam begging you
This game is a cross between Mad Max and DOOM both are great games also
Please do more! First part made me want to buy it. Lol
btw do half life 2
Looks dry to me, maybe an unpopular opinion. I played enough (too many) sandbox games and “sandbox” games to recognize an empty bland world vs a rich lived-in world. The combat seems amazing but for me if a game only has 1 single thing going for it I won’t play it. It needs more imoz
I never subscribe until this year but was watching your change since 2012
I have beaten the story and so far the gameplay is really good and smooth i love it
Borderlands and doom
Damn , that's what we call shooter games , not COD crap
BRad go all the way to the end for the children😣😣😣
YES!  Another Story Shooter game lol
Dang Brad where did you get your license...lost lake lol
I luv watchin your vids even old stuff
The way you play is so clunky,,
Borderlands 2 arena you mean the arena in Badass Crator of Badassitude? And the saints row the third arena you mean Genki's slaughter house (or whatever it was called, something like that)?
Brad i love this game i know views are not good but please continue playing this game -
Thank u soooooo much for making another video
Can't wait for next video for rage 2
Not watching just dropping a like and comment, will come back later. Brad is awesome
Pleaseeee do the whole game
Yes. Yes.





Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes.      Yes
Please finish the game I cant afford it right now so watching you play is the only way I'll get to see it. I could watch other ppl but they dont play like you or explain things through out
Saints Row ....
Doom x Borderlands x Wolfenstein
For days gone try do the secret endings with O’Brien and Lisa and iron mikes grave and can’t remember other but in O’Brien’s you see his face
Plz play the whole game lol im avoiding all other rage vids like the plague.
Almost passing James Charles xD
Please do the whole game brad that would be great
Just went back to your rage 1 playthrough and you sound like a kid in it haha
PLEASE KEEP THIS SERIES GOING

Do The Whole Game Bro We Loving It
Nobody cares about this trash. We want videos on actual good games. Boo RedBrad  boo 👎
Please do the series
This is literally borderlands
This is what DOOM should of been
Really cool game and enjoyable, I'm guessing you will finish the game in really short time or at least complete the main story in short time. next episode remember to use the exp you got.
YES! Rage!
Man it's the wildest thing. I am not subscribed to you. Yet, my subscriptions now shows you as part of channels I subscribed to. Anyone else have this happen? I literally don't watch this dude's videos at all.
This is a type of game I like
Please do more brad it not every  day you get to do awesome games like  THIS think  about it
Brad be savin me so much money lately.
Brad you do realize there are cannons on the car.
Waiting for part 3!!
You're the best YouTuber ever Brad

the end of the video!!!
I used to love doing the cards in rage one
Game looks beautiful
say needs three whole acts in act four
What a load of crap... "I might do a couple more of these." He diggin for views?
This game reminds me of Borderlands 2
I wish bodies and blood would pile up on the ground
ty for makeing more i love it ;D
I'm hooked on the gameplay,you gotta do the whole game for the people
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 10M SUBS BROTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wolfenstein was a more entertaining game

HOW CONVENINT
1st🔥🔥
Brad finally Reading comments And Also started giving Hearts! 🔥
finish the game for us
nice play brad you are asowm
Use you focus on the explosives instead of wasting a ton of bullets
@theRadBrad This game is like the Sunset Overdrive of first-person shooters.  From the footage I’ve watched it has some flavors of the more recent Far Cry games but seems to have lost all of the elements of the original Rage.  Avalanche seems to have contributed the bulk of the development with iD taking a backseat which is a bad thing to me.  This doesn’t look like a Rage game.
This is some real advanced warfare action game..!!
Plisss  continue plague
This game is like mad max.
We need more
That's not ar brad
Lol that ending
I can't wait to get this game. Just told hubby I am getting this game this weekend. I don't ask for half of the games I want.
Do u remember the game name the last of us..... U said that u were close to 1 million subscribers.... Now u are 10 million........ How does it feel to be now?
I just got a notification
Rad, why you always make me smile?
Do the whole game this is so fun to watch
do the whole game Brad!! I love it
Your kinda bad at this game
In first 500 viewers ^^
pls Brad, do the side stuff too, its realy interessting and a just as important part of it as the main story ^_~ either way, keep up the good work, much love from Austria <3

This game is way better than Borderlands. Borderlands is too cartoonish. Don't know why people like it so much.
Nice
LOOSUM HAGAR LOOKS ALOT MORE DIFFERENT THAN HER RAGE 1 COUNTERPART
It’s like Borderlands and doom had a baby and named it Rage 2
More midafucks more
Normal Mode is easy.. Crank it up to hard & things become much more intense..loving this game so far..hunting down all arks..

theRadBrad: Thats a gg there boys 😂
Goes into dark area where torches are everywhere, it's dark, and she says that they have to be careful.

"I was NOT expecting rats".
Game: (is a game about rats)
Brad: "I was not expecting rats" lol
The plague 
Finally a good game is coming

I love this game brad thanks for playing
I found your channel during Witcher Wild Hunt. Chubbs for President 2020!
I Don't Have PS4 But I'm Glad to Watch new gameplays as well. 
ThanK You Mr.Rad..
Tooo Much Love from Pakistan.. :)
Lucky me! Just caught up on Days Gone, now this!
Aww Hugo is so precious! When he gets scolded by Amicia, I just can't help but not aww
here at 3am watching these vids, this awesome game just grips you :)))
GUARD: Keep your eyes peeled
Brad: CROSS ON THE STREET
13:51
"Mmmmmmm?" 
"Mmmmmmm?"

TF was that sound? That was surely not a boat. Sounds like someone moaning at some delicious food lol.
All this game is, is every New York subway commuters worst nightmare lmfao
I subbed for your commentary and gameplay of  this game please continue!
Amicia: "let's go and see"
Brad: "let's go and see? Let's get out of here!" 😂😂😂
It’s great game Thanks for playing that and please continue this
This game reminds me of Lara Croft with the art style and puzzle format.
Love this game I was hoping you play it and you did 
❤❤❤thank you brad 😍
I love Hugo so much. His mannerism, voice and movement is perfect. The Game devs did such a great, for some weird reason I feel sympathy for him.
sleepless night... here comes brad...alley-oop ✌️✌️✌️✌️
Can you show us what happens when you get caught by guards or rats??
The trailers honestly ruined the ending, please do not watch the trailers.
Has a perfectly good path to use but chooses to walk through bloody mud... SMH
Waiting for this game to rip my heart out 😂😂😂
I Cant Wait For Part 4,Please Keep Up The Good Work!
22:25
I'm not the only one who notice the giant pig testicles am I?
Anyone New..
Do watch Detroit Become Human
Days Gone

Hey brad, long time fan, please dont edit out your deaths , it spoils the flow of the video, plus your reactions might be funny?. I love this game, deffo a sleeper hit of 2019. It gets very hard later on and the puzzles are always simple but take more than a first glance to solve. This game is proberly the most brutal dictation of the plague era, in this day an age of censorship madness its nice to see a gritty historical game with the gore and the blood and the fear and grief that was around then. Keep up the great work. This is a must buy if you love single player games, we gotta keep the single player games going!
Idk why but I love Hugo, I got respect for the lil dude
Thanks brad keep playing this one bro
Some wieird ass edits dude. Please don’t do that from the nest part
I didn't ask for this game but Wow I love it!!! 🔥

Dont get me wrong though this Is a Good game.
This game is like a walking simulator, repetitive.
this is such an interesting game and so different from all the popular games out right now
Yassss I'm so happy that you uploaded another part of this!!
I don't have a console to play this game ...so please continue the game 🤗
I've watched the series and I love it. Please continue. I've liked all the videos and hope you can continue part 4. Thank you!
If you're watching this late and there are more episodes out already when Brad said cows i thought they were cows not PIGS (that's why you're reading this right)
RadBrad,I am getting hooked again!....
"Let's go and see? I don't know about that, let's get outta here!!" 

Reminds me of why we keep coming back for more from Brad 😂 And ermmm of course at times because you don't have a PS to play exclusives :P
When you wish it was days gone...(unlimited rocks)
hope you will upload more for this game its a new thing and wanna see more of it
I love the setting of this game, French plague era. Historical setting game! I’ll buy it at $15.
I'm calling it now Hugo is the grand Inquisitors son and he's immune
I see you RadBrad. The grind is real. I watched Days Gone and now Im ready for another great adventure. Sending good vibes from South Bronx, New York
I love this game so far! Hope you continue it.
If possible brad play all known game to mankind. I'd enjoy it till I die.

Another great video but more Days Gone please!
just in time, open a youtube page and instantly watch
More please!  Thanks man! You always deliver!
Love that small guy ! His voice is amazingly cute.
We do want to see you fail aswell.. Adds more tension to the game for us viewers. Otherwise it will seem as if Amicia is just going for a walk hand in hand with her bro.
And we can try to figure out the puzzles aswell! Rock on!
Yey a new upload!Please keep playing this i wish you all the best!Support from Japan😁😁
Loving the series, please keep it up :)

Anyway pls continue, really curious whts gonna happen next.
Please keep it going! 
Everyone keep liking it up!
Lit video 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well brad that's what you get because nobody expects the rodent inquisition
They should go to lost lake camp. It safe there.
Man, the game designers really missed an opportunity to have Amicia crush rats with her elbow armor ;)
Don’t leave us hanging mate it’s to good
Yes yes Rad Brad please continue with this series!! I binged on Days Gone now I got into this one . CONTINUE CONTINUE!!!
Love it Brad!!!! I love this story and I get to hear chapter three!!! Thanks so much. I don't get to play games so this is my vicarious living!!!
Can't watch part 4. It says it's a private video. Help me out
Realizes there's no part 4 yet :(( I want more... but I also want you to continue Days Gone.... Oh the humanity!
I just wanna ask you is this the physical copy tof the game or the digital?
I just  finished watching part 2 and I saw the notification😅😊

Aww shit here we go again.
rathole opens up
runs right into it
Didn’t expect I’d be so hooked on this
I love how the NPCs adopt that Skyrim "Musta been the wind" outlook on life
I've been keeping close watch on your updates for this game and I can't wait for more as I finish up your Days Gone series. Feel like I've missed a lot of your playthroughs as I've been getting my life together, glad to see that you're still a very enjoyable gamer as well as commentator.
53 seconds! Love you Brad!
guard : whats thats noise ?..maybe theres someone hidding in the pan  😂
Subscribed in 2019. Can’t wait to play this game. Finally good linear style game!
You could hunt crows with sling
Aww Hugo is so precious :’(
Yeah Brad continue it! I want to know the story and watch it all the way to the end! :D
Keep this series coming! I really enjoy it.
I was about to go on tetra's channel to see if he is playing it as well or not and then refreshed the page and saw this and i was like.. well i am sticking to brad. Uploaded the video just in time. Thx brad have a good day
Oh yeah this is a great game to play when you have mice infested walls.

O-O-O
F L E A S  O N  R A T S 
F L E A S  O N R A T S
LOL as I watched part 2 just right now, and then part 3 CAME OUT tf.. lucky!!!
OMG I love this game. Just the threats of the rats is so frightening.
Dang, here before 50 likes 😂
Mr. Rad have a blessed day brother 🙏🏽
Brad are you going to do a vlog on the diamond play button I remember you saying that before
Is anyone else more tense because Brad edits out getting caught, so you don't know exactly how horrible it'll be?
I like how he say “hey guys so welcome back to...” I should get that tattooed on me 😍😍
Ahh how i wish i have a sister.
You deserve the destruction of that like button, this series is far more intriguing than I thought
Yo this game is so good and so different from the ones that recently came out! I love it ❤️❤️❤️
all these jump cuts are telling me this game's actually difficult, unlike most triple A hand holding simulators
The last of us but switched genders
Do you all guys realize amicia's face was changed compared to the demo version? Amicia's face looked like Daisy Ridley on the latter version
Maybe for avoiding copyright ingfringment?
where is the part 4 brad eagerly waiting for it..
What I've been waiting for all day <3
Continue brad, This fantastic so far!!!!
Please continue until the end!! 😄
Damn that AI knew it was the second time, that's some small but smart asf detailing from the devs
believe it or not Brad I seen this on Steam and it's gots 9 out of 10... I just don't talk I tell you something... but I think you should finish the game  I mean you can look up the ratings and see
Plz continue this game brad!
Brad yo I just wanna know do u pre upload your videos and set them Private cuz it says u have seven videos but it's only 3
YOU ARE MISSING SO MANY ITEMSSSSSSSS>>>KRIINNGGGGEEE
action shooters are played out my man. please finish this series and play more games like this. inside, gris, a way out, cuphead, hellblade, and little monsters are some of the best series you have done imo. so much fun!

Brad you a fan of wrestling like wwe I heard you when you said the rock says 😂😂😂lol
I really hope you can keep this through the end!!! It seems like such a good game
Well, you've done it again.  Hooked me on a story.  Please, continue this.  
Did you know, the Plague is clearly part of this tale and the Inquisition.  But the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) was active as well.  Oi!  What a headache I have.
More brad more, please!
I just finished watching part 2 and here’s part 3. How convenient

The gameplay is same old same old, but the story may have something to offer?  Definitely interested in this one now.

Please continue this, I need to know what happens
Who else love these videos?
"Leave me alone!" I feel bad for Hugo haha
I really really hope you do the whole series the story is incredibly interesting
stop walking through the mud when there's a PATH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
This game looks like it's based of the era in which the Black Plague occurred across Europe.
Love from Serbia bro your videos are awesome
I think I want this game even though it will creep my wife out as she is terrified of rats and mice
Why other parts are not appearing for me😢
I really like this game, I hope you keep playing it!

Cool 😉 thanks that you share the third part of this game. I quite like it, but after I saw the price of it, LOL guess I will be waiting a bit that the price goes down, because I believe that you play this game pretty fast, maybe a week or so when working.

poor hugo, i sometimes think his sister is to harsh on him, even though he has good manners for a   5 year old and is very ill but ik she cares about him and is scared
All the games brad plays looks so cool but i dont play them cuz i already know the story because i watched brad
Please upload part 4 asap.
Reminds me of Hitman Absolution mixed with some Res Evil 4 and Lara Croft. Seems a bit too on rails / repetitive so far but the story and setting are great.
looks incredibly similar to senua
I know yall think im lying but ive been a fan since you did your first episode on the last of us
More More!

Anyone else thinks they see rats it reminds you of the song by ghost,

When the character says rats I just do the noise which goes along with it

Mate try killing the guys without helmets
I like this game so far. Keep them coming...
You can kill guards without helmets.Just slingshot them in head.
Just right now again! It's been awhile since I followed, but one of the main reasons is that even way back when,YOU kept the cussing to a minimum, which few even today can do or control. It's that ever so small thing that you have that most don't, self control and respect. This allowed me to watch you with my then 4 year old son, opening up his world into gaming. I appreciate it now as much as I appreciated it then. THANK YOU!
Is this game out on all platforms or no?
Nice! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Please upload this more ...
lets gooo ! keep this series going, por favor !
A beautiful game
I love these brother sister relation . Too bad that I don't have anyonr
Continue
Why couldn’t Amica see her mother ?
This is an amazing game
I mean when rad let alicia get eaten by rats they didn't seem interested in the boy at all. so could be he can control the rats if he learns how to since they won't attack him
My favourite series that brads ever made was spider-man. Anyone else?
I agree too😊
This game makes me act like I’m in minecraft in real life
Love this series thanks brad
YEEESSSSSSS
No more Days gone 😭
LETS GET THIS
Please like this brad!!!
So this game is based in what I assume to be 12th century France (1300s) during the time of the Black Plague, a pandemic that wiped out between 75 to 200 million people across the European continent, also known as Eurasia. This pandemic lasted between 1347 into 1351, which is a five year span of time. Though in that five year span, millions died from the Plague.

I'm taking a wild guess that this storyline is based in 1347 or 1348, at the very latest for 1348, when the pandemic first started across Europe.

Excuse my little history comment, I hope y'all don't mind. As an archaeologist I really enjoy piecing stuff together and figuring historical stuff out.
More of this brad.
thank you brad!!!
I am waiting for part 4
bro drop part 4
Honestly amazing that the antagonist is named Nicholas cause now I can get scared when outta nowhere I here my name
I really think this is a great game, but the voice acting is so weak. They don't really try to trick our mind to thinking they're really in the scene. Lacking emotion is a better way of saying it.
Is that little boy a monster the girl his protector from him turn evil. Great content lets see what the series awaits
Please make more rage 2 videos

watching this while having my suhoor
Aw she’s struggling to see she’s a parent full time. At least they met Lucas. Beatrice (their mother) could only care for one just like how their dad raised her when he could. I think the maids encouraged her to leave her mother alone.

Thanks a lot ❤️
Keep it up Brad! Its like my netflix at this point.
I’m watching this on my phone, but does ‘we all done things’ look like Woody Harrelson from Zombieland? Great vids as always Brad 🌻
I like your playing,Rad. Keep it up bro. Waiting for your vedioes on THE LAST OF US PART 2
You have to keep recording videos until you 100 percent complete the game.
Awesome game  BEND STUDIO should make another DAYS GONE 2 👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Keep them coming for as long as you can, really enjoying the video's.  😊
DMN IM EXCITED FOR THE SECRET ENDING! GOTTA SEE HOW IT GOES DOWN WITH O'BRIAN! THANKS @theRadBrad
I'm curious about what happens if you take a different bike to the mevhanic
wow brad 10 million subscribers, awesome.. congratulations
He wasted a whole mag for 1 guy hahahah and the way he kept shooting when he's dead it's so funny, the ragdoll made it better
Thanks Brad for the insomnia , its been a hell of a ride!!  now what to do.
Thanks for continuing the game this has made my day
Complete the whole game and you will get a secret ending (not lying)
Yeah~! More Days Gone~!
God bless you, Brad~!
Dude im so close to getting a platinum on this game and it would be my first platinum i ve been playing since april the 26th
Anyone know where sarah is? (After ending)
I could’t find her ..
Brad.... Man i love whatever you you make for us and i really.. Really appreciate it but their is one think always.. You forget to do something in which is very important and that is changing guns abd strategies
AHHH THANK YOU, BRAD! i can't physically play video games so this is really the only way.
Like button destroyed. It's pronounced ma-raw-der. Not mar-uder
please keep posting a video at least once a day. i would personally prefer you post 2 videos every day so i have something to watch when i come home from school. i look forward to watching these every day.
Probably the best game I've ever seen... in realistic way, and having that non-censored straight up talk, no political correctess no nothing to make it sound like sweet talking every time you kill someone. 
Manly man game for sure! 
Besides that end-game content is so incredibly fun. D: Can't wait to get that game in my hands and get chased by a huge crowd of 'fans' XD 
Ohh... just imagine if you could mod the game... if you simply could get 1k or more hordes like 10k. It would be freaky.
Me: Looks up and just sees a deer get slammed

Brad: I've never tried to ovoid a deer so much and still hit it.

LOL 😁😂
Ayy been waiting for this!💪


I watched Ep 1 five days ago and finally catched up with the ending!🤣
Brad please upload everything you do in this. I am enjoying every single bit of it.
So happy to see more of this! I loved watching this game!

Been waiting for this! Thank you for all the work you do brad!
You play only for playing,many times  you play without any interest
There are some special endings you can get if you continue to play
Tough the main story is over I enjoy your gameplay of it as much.

Shoots ONE bullet from a light machine gun and reloads. 😂
Famous last word : How convenient 
Lmao i got it stuck in my head 😂😂
That failed jump attempt was like if Wipeout used Motorcycles instead of hard timing stamina I loved that show 😁
GOTY? too soon to say, give it till the next update in June. remember there is a DLC coming

Thanks Brad, after having 4 parts a day to gasp, laugh, and pray you can outrun that horde, I couldn't stand to go cold turkey. You could do 1 or 2 a day and everything will be fine. Your the best.
Dude sounds super crazy just talking to himself like that lol.
Finish this game like 100%. We wanna see all hordes missions 😍😍👌🔥

Thanks Brad, but remember the motto - More is better???  ( ';') Keep em coming. (';' )
I really hope they do a Days Gone 2,  this series and game were amazing!
The biggest horde in the game i think is on the Old Sawmill that you beat in 2 phase
100% Trophies are quite doable..go for it
You are so noob when facing this horde LOL
Hey brad 
My name is aswin
I really cant get this game 
So i watch your gameplay

Your talking is what keeps me like it
So keep talking and do days gone videos please
Horde it up man! Been watching your vids for years. This game is awesome. You’re awesome. “Let’s do this”
Siphon Filter Easter Egg with a breakdown please! :D
Finally I managed to cope up. More power for you. Thanks a lot for the vids.
Brad keep it up brother! I’m loving this series..
" I MISSED ONE I THINK " 😂              I haven't laughed this hard in a long time, THANX BRAD
Brad at the start of taking out the horde: boy this is easy and it's so small

Brad 2 minutes later: boy this is crazy, they're so fast 

😅
Keep playing rage 2. Loved the first part ❤️ much love brad
PEOPLE WANT ME TO USE THE CROSSBOW MORE! Most frequent saying of 2019......
Brad, have You seen the alternate ending videos? In one if the Deac meets tgat Brian guy and he says: They are coming and no one can stop them.
Than he takes his safety mask off and you are that he's syarting to morph. ....
Brad u have to keep playing this game. Road to 100%
Love ya man thanks for the awesome vids!!!
Yes, the breakers and reachers are faster than your default run speed.  Not sure if they are faster than sprint but obviously you skimped on stamina, and have missed about 2/3 of the NERO injectors so far.
I love you...but it frustrates me seeing you run around in circles...
If you are having fun then we are having too, plEAs make more vids. And PLEASE FINISH SEKIROOOO!!!
love ur vids bro keep up and please do more of these thanks
Apparently when you 100% the game the secret ending impacts the story huge!  Loved this series Brad, this journey was insane!
No doubt why you are the king of walkthroughs
Please upload more of this . This is my stress reliever after work ! Thanks Brad !
I have loved your play through  and watched obsessively but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THROW MOLOTOVS OR SOMETHING while trying to retreat!!
Good Gracious. Never think you have more video on this 😂😂😂 how convenient....
I enjoy you're vids brad and keep it up.
MINI SPOILER

Hey brad, you can find deacons rings over at the miltia base camp. As well as Sarah's wedding ring.
So sad its over. But had a blast watching every video. Keeps posting bonus vids!
Hey Brad please don't stop with games upload man. It is so cool to watch!
Brad I'm very happy that you are doing some side stuffs and kinda exploring the game so that we can enjoy it
@theradbrad we need more man. I'd like to see you complete the Finding Nero story line, maybe O'Brian tell Deek more about the evolution of the freakers. Also, eager to see you upgrade your bike man.

That's more like it! please Brad continue  to a 100%! never missed a video of this game!! don't forget to do the O'brian things  :D

Epic ending and a pro gamer 
All hail theradbrad !!
Please do more finding NERO stuff bc there's a secret ending
16:07 That reaction of Deacon and Brad is hilarious, lol.
Brad's casual chuckle when he failed the bridge jump, LOL! I nearly spat my drink out seeing Deacon sprawled while Brad laughed :)
yes waited for more parts since there is a lot of incompleted missions that you did not finish it especially Lisa thank you
Keep em coming Brad!!! Thanks bro.

Please continue making videos 
We want to see all endings of the game
Gimme moarrrrrr!!! I know you got the footage, just upload it all at once!! I never like a video but liked them all!
Hey Brad, love your videos but could you please finish the Lisa story-line? It seemed really interesting so just wanted the conclusion. Thanks!
Love the work ethic Brad keep pumping them out and I'll keep watching them!
I was about to watch avengers  and just decided to refreshed YouTube...for my surprise... Brad's Days gone !!  How convenient. sorry avengers but you have to wait !!
I love the series so much! Much love Brad! Don't stop being awesome!
Love your days gone vids. Keep posting

Awesome Brad, thank you for posting another one, keep them coming. still the best game out
It's such a beautiful game dude! Glad to see you'll do extra videos of the side stuff, most people don't do that
OH YUP! BEEN WANTING MORE OF THIS EVER SINCE THE ENDING
Is there music in this game? Did you mute it?
Was there music in the end credits?
TheRadBrad: so you perform that, hold that, tap that to do a range attack.

That’s a bar....
Brad 100% the game ! 
We want more, amazing game !
Brad plz upgrade your bike at Diamond Lake.. They've got the sickest upgrades..and obviously the best weapons..
I would keep watching if you post more vids
My precioussssssss ... hummm I mean , nice another Days Gone video from Brad :D
Please complete all of the game. Thank you so much I have enjoyed watching this game thus far.
Please keep going bro, more horde missions, bounty’s
I watched everything you did on another channel in less than 9 hours...love your stuff but this shit went way to long bro
this game should never end i was expecting 500 episodes from brad for this one 😭
I would like to see more. been following your vids on it since you started.. it actually is why i started to play myself
I loved this game. I am really sad that I did not get in on the free give away during the first video. Ah well. Thanks for posting more!!
You gotta do 100%. There’s a secret ending!
Sawmill is suppose to be the biggest hoard I think
Hey Brad I watched the complete series and I just wanna let u know the Chicago chopper is not as good as the AR u had before u switched it.
amazing game with amazing gameplay waiting for the vids like hell I kinda feel sorry you finished the game ... less videos
thank you brad for the post ending videos
Is it just me, cuz I can’t stop watching days gone and brad
Loving this game definitely keep em coming!!!
What I think you should do is make long videos because people seem to be very interested like I am still watching 😁 but it’s fine whatever you continue doing
Please record the ending with the sound track on. For the full immersion, if you could. I understand that it's YouTube 2019,  but...
better than RDR2 and GoT 😂😂
I don't understand why people are so harsh on this game it's amazing and I haven't even gotten it yet 😂🤣 but I seriously don't understand why.
Of course we want more of this game.[][]
Hello Brad. I love you. I love your videos. Looking forward to more Days Gone gameplay.
Love that you're continuing to play even after you finish it's great
Great idea will luvv it!! I search all the time of after the end story!! Luv brad❤️
Absolutely loved the series, always enjoy watching your content. You are one of few who complete a game. I struggle with buying the games for myself so having your videos are amazing for me and. So many others. Can't wait for more side stuff and the secret ending 😁
I literally wait for your next video in this series. I really hope you keep putting up videos, especially horde missions. It's like these kids are my new favorite TV show. Lol
Keep spamming us I really don't mind.  Love this game.
A good way of getting your trust level up is these Horde missions, the bounties rack up a huge amount XP.
Please just stay making these vids and getting 100% on everthing

Hi Brad! Cool video, been waiting for this!
Hey brad I will be so angry if you don't finish this game😂😂😂😂😂
Yoo man too early 🤘
Crossbow bolt that makes freaks attack each other might buy you some time?
Syphon Philter was such an awesome game back in the day! Didn't they make a couple? Either way, great game.
Do more of these, please. We're hooked man
Ok so am I the only one who played the game and did everything at once and had absolutely nothing left 😂
You should get that mashine gun sidearm. Probably better for hordes
Damn, now that the series is over I don’t have anything to watch anymore 🤧
This is definitely my favorite game of 2019 so far......
Woah i nvr been this fast, hope there will be more of days gonee!
deff want to see some videos when they come out with the horde mode
Brad u should bring a horde to a enemy or friendly camp
I KNEW IT! Thanks Brad for this vid, gonna destroy the like button as you say.
Hey Brad you should play drinking game rules like every time Decon spots a big cat you have to go for a horde regardless of what supplies you have on you
Keep doing it....I watched all parts till date
B-Rad, upgrade your stamina a bit
brad where to find sarah after completing the game ?
Not sure if I already wrote this in the comments of your last video for this game but there's another ending with O'Brian if you keep playing - it kind of sets up the coming DLC, I think...  Seems that way anyway..
Omg yes!!! Thank you so much for following through with the extras!!!!!!!!!
Perhaps try preparing the area before pulling the horde..  lay proximity mines et, plan the route, watching you run for your life is fun... but oh the indigestion! LOL <GRIN>
I kept refreshing my browser waiting for more :)
YOU HALF TO BALANCE STAMINA AND HEALTH IN ALL THESE TYPE OF GAMES BRAD
Wow! I can't believe i just watch all Days Gone! And there's even more! 
Keep it up.
Yes please keep going till 100, love this game, love you
You already killed the biggest horde at the sawmill
Keep up the awesome work i would love to see this game all the way through, with ya since the walking dead
yo if you get the semi automatic shotgun with a drum it works nice man one shot kills you should try it
Please more. The best series I have seen so far!
Dawn of the dead game would be awesome .. I’ve been waiting for marvel to come out with a daredevil game @theRadBrad

Brad, im relatively new to your channel (MK 11) but im really  digging your posts and walkthroughs. The days gone game i would say is the best ive seen out so far and love the videos that you bring out. Keep them coming, id like to see what kinda trouble you can get Saint John into next.
Keep up the fantastic work. I cant wait to see what you do next.
Go to diamond lake to upgrade your bike
Dude! The way you took out the bikers, especially the second one while he was sitting on his bike about to ride away.. That was true mafia-type execution that too with a Tommy Gun.. Reminded me of Sonny Corleone's execution in The Godfather
if you listen while Brad is killing the guards on the gate, you can hear the creature he kills at 15:20 stalking him.
Awesome. Keep them coming. I don’t want the videos to end.
Vro I freaking love this guy every time I’m sick or its a game I cant get [THE chair thrower] is always their to save my wallet
19:03  😂😂😂😭👌🏾
This game did deserve more than 5 out of ten! The story was amazing, the missions are not super repetitive. Also, there is so much more to do after the story is over! I will be buying the game when I get a chance. Thank you for making these videos!
There's a secret ending with O'Brian's storyline
Brad, are you planning to do the horde missions?
Please carry on posting this, great content!
Keep it going 
100% everything
Plz complete this game full❤️ much love
Just keep uploading, we love to watch you
don’t stop uploading
Hope the endgame gameplay continues Brad thank you for the great series it feels like the best you have ever done on your channel.
Yup! Those zombies do seem a little faster.
The sawmill was my fav. (Sorry)
Aye another video let’s go brad I’m so glad ur re visiting it👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Days gone 2 time to take back our world
Please wipe another horde for us and we're waiting for the secret ending too.thanks for playing it even though the story is finished we want to see some more.
brad, we are destroying that like button soo....
Loved this game a lot hope to see more of it
Watching you play this makes me want to buy a PS4 just so I can play this game
Brad you can try luring small horde to an enemy camp.
Please, keep the video's coming.
No views but I’m the 6th like 😂💀
I'm kinda pissed that during free roam I cant find Sarah or kouri
Can you just play this game forever
Please finish up brad💕💕💕💕
I cant get over this Ex- TBH! :D :D :D
You should try all weapons man, let us see how they get the job done
Make more videos of this plz this game is so good
As another person said, if we're watching at 76 videos in we hooked til you decide to stop uploading on days gone bud, this is simply a amazing game and it's best shared with a amazing youtuber as yourself.
Hey bro can u go to iron mike funeral.
that horde was crazy LOOOOL
Brad there is a NERO secret ending... with Obrein ... that was badass ending
Please keep it up we love the series and want those secret ending scenes !!
i just can't get enough of this amazing game
Please definitely do more horde videos! I have the game but to scared to actually do those hahaha can only watch it.
Anyone else notice the people you rescue kinda all looking the same. LoL
The biggest horde is the Saw Mill (lumber yard) Horde you've already done it but you never had the Horde Health Bar when you did it so you might be able to do it again, the mass grave construction site is a good one to do.
Thanks for continuing
When you’re throwing the Molotov, throw it more towards the center of the horde instead of the front so you can do more damage
This games now a days have so much better stories compared to real movies. We get attached to characters. I am going to miss this gameplay videos. Deacon showing superpowers, Boozer's jokes and becoming one punch man. Everything
You gotta zig zag dude not run straight an why do u run away from crap
Newest comment for a second xD   Yeah,i would like to see more of Days Gone. :) Lets put all the hordes down. Maybe,then you would get something.I did not saw that flame gun in action,where you make fire,with it... Or is it unavailable ? If enemy is using it,then maybe we can too somehow ? Maybe its a gift when 100 proc,will be completed ?
You should buy smp9 as it is a very good side arm
Loving it, please keep posting more, I just dont have time to play this one.
I would definitely love a DLC to this game man that would be amazing
Plz complete the hord missions
I really enjoy your videos. Just wanted to say thanks for doing what you do. Being a housewife and a mother of a daughter that is graduating in a few days, I haven't had much to spend on games. Thanks for the opportunity to watch these games I've been anticipating, even if I can't play them yet.
duuudeeee sawmill was the biggest horde and you did it so casually
Make another Badass Malee weapon, you need one for the hoards when they run up on you.  I'm still watching Days Gone. I know the ending is near and it's been an epic ride, thank you. Let's Get It! Downloaded the full version of Days Gone the other day... I;l never make it to the playing level as you, but I'm gonna give it my ALL!
Thanks for still playing brad
upload more
Can you do the Easter egg video and give a breakdown
Do more of these man??
Keep it going Brad ! :)
I love your Channel Brad if I am on the edge if I want to buy the game I watch you play and decide oh and when fighting hordes wouldn’t it be better to throw the pipe bomb a a little a head of you and run pass
Watching this whilst I wait for one punch man. Not unhappy with my wait :)
I like the series but im more interested in “The plague innocence” please pretty please keep playing that game.😁
I like the series but im more interested in “The plague innocence” please pretty please keep playing that game.😁

Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going full steam!
The more you play the game the more the zombies evolve
Brad. You NEED to finish the Nero stuff
Does deacon ever get his bike back
There is more to the game that I suggest u record
I wish he'd use focus when running & gunning
Try taking a horde into an enemy camp! They'll thin out the horde a bit for you, and the horde will take out the camp
Post more of'em man..!
Keep them video's coming brad!!! The best series ever.!!!!
You were supposed to take our all the anarchist
Brad you not gonna mention the secret Nero ending?
Hell yea brother thank you!
Pleasee play THE LAST OF US 2

Hey Brad I'm typing this before watching this video, if you haven't made it to the mission where O'Brian takes his helmet off.....oh man u really need to get to that one cause it's crazy
EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU BRAD
please don’t stop uploading lol
Brad, Marauder[mah-raw-der]
I heard that when you finish all the objectives there's a secret ending
I also think you should do a video showcasing all the guns that you bought but didn't use.

do 30 minute parts
keep up the good ur bro ur the best on world
keep the coming if u want i'll watch everyone
Dope video gamer keep with the vids
Stupid questions. How does the Freaker or Hooligan Virus spread (airborne, blood, etc.). And how are Deacon and the others not infected? I may have missed that part in the videos.
Brad there is the secret  ending that you need to get if you complete 100% the Nero missions and the wold end, you need to see it
Brad, have you even watched someone take down a horde, because you are epically bad at it. Painful to watch bad at it.
thank you for showing us more
Keep the videos coming love this game!
I definitely want to see more of the hordes and I wanna know what's all going on with Lisa because last we say her was when we rescued her from a Ripper.
Im still shocked about the rating on this game the story was so good even more gf wanted to watch that never happens....shame
Brad definitely want more ...keep on playing
I bought finally 😍😍
YeeeeeeeaH!! More!!
Love your vids <3
Please do all the quests Brad. We wanna see 100% from your side.
Hello, the best walkthrough I've seen. I have seen that there is another end in which O'Brian has to do, maybe you should make that end.
Always want more videos!
Brad can you adopt me pls im a homeless boy and i need to work in a wet market so that i can watch your vids😟
Definitely record the horde missions. Or at least the final one!
Smp9 is a large capacity side arm.
Lol Breaker, Reacher, and Screamer appear at the same time haha

I really like this game men..

brad go to the diamond lake and upgrade your bike mate :) nice contents, by the way, thank you for the videos,and also my man I know when your playing you cant focus more on items more than someone watching but man you don't pay attention sometimes and you lose lots of good items that you can get ,
There is a secret ending with Bryan ,if u read comments u would Fuking know
I would really like to see you taking down the hordes using traps

yay waiting for this
You should do a vid with face cam
Keep it going please . i love this game
I wanna see a video of u exploring the map all those white parts I'm curious of what u can find there
thanks for the upload brad i was thinking you might not post another vid of this game for a while. btw, if you want to see how to defeat a horde without even using molotovs/cocktails watch shirrako's channel. he just uses all of his guns lol. takes some skill but it's more fun that way lol.
Bring on more videos of this game.
We need more of this video
Kind of sad this game is over. Never found out if Boozer's dog is still alive. This series was fun to watch and enjoy seeing you crash the motorcycle multiple times. Keep it up Brad
Scary game i won't play this game
It's kinda weird I just found out about you like a week ago and you are one of my favorite youtubers
Please Need more of this Game.
Sorry Brad :( i feel so bad now, video popped in my feed showing the 4 endings, i knew you would play more of the game (hordes and stuff) but didn't occur to me you would too play the other endings :( I'll still watch every one of these videos though :)
does anyone know the location of sarah after finishing the main story? i have found every charakter in camps and so on but only sarah is missing :/
Please do more of these 🙂
Hey radbrad can you sell other people's bikes? Also can you replay the game with everything unlocked?
finalyyyy😍😍
what was the siphon filter thing about in game?
Brad please do the o'brian thing make it 100% asap... you need to see that e nding....
All the 29 people that disliked it, can be thrown in a horde 🥵💯
Oh hells yeah.! Thanks Brad
The story gets deeper then just finding Sarah.  There is also a storyline about the freakers and NERO and how they go hand and hand you should check out that storyline, the NERO one that is.
Wait they still call deacon corporal when the colonel is already dead and the militia thing is gone
The part numbers continues!
please upload more of A Plauge Tale,

Hey brad restart the game haha
personally i want to see you take down the nests too, not just the hordes, ive really been liking this game, even though the main story is over
amazing bro👍😎👍😎👍😎
Well good news on that brad you already killed the biggest horde in the game its the sawmill one
Just admit it , you can't put down the controller after all the attachment
I wonder if the developers will add a feature where after you beat the game and kill all the hordes you can opt to have them respawn
First, Always love your videos, Brad.   Keep up the good work.
Ye boi i love these parts
Assman is back ! LOL
We just saw the dark side of theRadBrad at 18:14.😂😂😂

Keep it up with this game!
Keep this videos coming this game is epic👌
hey brad i noticed there seems to be no music at all in your recent playthroughs, which sucks because there have been teams working on those in each game....did you mute the music to avoid youtube 'copyright issues' or something?
Dude. Your bike....

Has anyone else used the hordes to wipe out the camps I love doing that
You need to meet o'brain his going yo show a secret to you

16:15 How to hunt deer

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.   That deer though!  Bonk!
I wait for days gone like it was episodes of a TV show. And I'd rather get spammed with this than plague, right now.
Hey return to lost lake camp
I dont understand why so many reviews are low...?.?.?.?
Aww the rest is private smh again
I think the sawmill horde was the biggest one. The hordes that would be closer in comparison to the sawmill horde are around the mountains I think.
U rock bro u are the best
Was waiting for more parts
Hey brad upgrade the bike please
Please post all mission in future
Keep it going!!! Its better then walking dead!
Wooooo! HELL YEAAAHHH!!! XD
You can spam us with these videos Brad. Don’t worry

Ps5 comeing out in 2020

Use the attraction device to get the horde bunched together then use molotovs, napalm, machine gun, etc.
EASTER EGG!
Another smashes cup
Do the last Neri mission 👌
Post more of plague tale innocence
7:56 Guess they missed you... :D

Can’t wait for that 100% reaction
loved the days gone vidoe
I gotta admit that I am addicted to these videos
Keep the videos coming
Buat video lagi bohhhh....
Keep up with this series, please.
You have to finish the O'Brien missions
If you shoot the rope the person hung will drop and sometimes can be searched
Yes more Days gone!
I really like the horde missions but more fun are the ones where you run around and shoot gas tanks
@theRadBrad we wanna see the Nero thing cause it was building so much detail story on the evolution of zombies something big must be there
79th viewr ahh am so late😀😀😀
YES!!!!!!!
More more more!!! Great game 9 out of 10
16:53 BAMBI !!!! NOOOOOOOOO

Brad you should get a horde to chase you and run into an enemy camp and see what happens

Don't you dare stop days gone without finishing all the side mission and shit, try a new gun man & custom accent, oh yeah if sarah is at lost lake, where would she be ?
You could lour the horde over to kill them, might be kinda interesting.
Super Special Awesome Series!
Next time throw the grenade/pipe bomb at your feet while you run instead of turning around to throw it at the horde. It’s much more effective.
100% PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I LOVE IT.
Nice gaming! Go on, Brad!
Finish the nero story brad pls
The biggest horde in the game was the Sawmill horde with 500 freaks! Don’t forget the secret ending when you complete “Finding Nero”, O’Brian will eventually contact you again!
Do more videos
Do More your awesome!!!
So it same for me, the breaker, screamer and the fast zombie came out once you explode the gate. But instead I kill the enemy I ran to the little tower and let them kill each other hehhee then snipe the remaining zombie
I want this game to never end
Do more hordes videos
Can’t get enough of watching everyone’s different hoard tactics

hi brad I'm not disapointed or anything but if you could upload more of days gone Horde gameplay that'll be good. oh and did you know if the seacret ending in days gone with O'Brien. You can go look it up it's pretty cool. But I don't know how to get to the ending but Ytube knows so yah I don't have the game so I couldent go check. LOVE YOUR VIDEOS BRAD KEEP IT UP!!!!!!!
Brad I have to say I love every video.  I have been building computers and gaming since 1981.  A 100% computer gamer until 3 months ago when I got my PS4 PRO.  My wife has every gaming platform since the Odyssey.  I broke away from the computer, and plugged the PS4 Pro into my 4k HD tv and love it.  However, the transition from mouse and keyboard to controller has not been easy.  Your videos have helped this old gamer make the transition a little easier.  Keep it up and many thanks! ! !
15:40 😁😂
Play more plague innocence
At about 15:20 that freaked looked like a werewolf. And Brad some of those freakers are faster than you, remember their called reachers
Try to complete the worlds end mission's, there is another unbelievable cutscene of O'Brian. And other multiple cutscenes if you go to Lost lake and find Rikki . And also complete the ripper mission, another ending too
great vids brad keep them comeing

18:13 damn brad overkill lol
More vids brother
Brad, while I appreciate your concern of possibly spamming us the viewers it is, in fact, impossible to do so. Spam is unsolicited notification or information and I do not turn on my YouTube notification bell and so I voluntarily watch your videos or not, it is 100% my choice always. The viewers control the vertical and horizontal of what we watch, you could produce a million videos an hour every hour and we the viewers would still be in charge or how many we watch.
the game about the plague is way better
more please!
Secret ending?
Do More Videos like this!!!!!
Another Great Video!!!!!!
Sir..  I thought you will not play this game..  Thank you sir for continuing this series.. Really benefit to a people like me without ps4..

Brad. I’ve never commented on a video before. I found your channel when I saw the tomb raider game in 2013 . I watched the entire series in a day never stopping watching it until the end   I love watching your videos because it gives me a chance to see what the new games look like   I don’t make enough money to get the next gen consoles so I don’t get to play the next gen games. But you give me the opportunity to see these games. Don’t stop what you’re doing. You give us a chance to experience it all. Thank you.
Stop ik kijk dit van jou en denniskuhh die speelt ook dit en yarasky player ook nooooooooooooooooooooooog😓

If I remember correctly I found sometime in 2010. But I don’t really recall haha 😅
It's basically shooting and alternate fire of Doom, vehicle play like Mad Max, blow stuff up and cause chaos like Just Cause, humor of Borderlands, objectives and side quests like Far Cry. It's a great game.
It’s weird that everyone is dying around them and they just don’t care
Wow 10million subscribers. Nice.
I was there from the start, love your channel keep up the good work
I started watching you back in 2011 when I was 7 now I’m 14
Props to Sam Reigel as the male Walker voice!
I really love the fact that you're filled with gratitude and never fails to express it at the start of every video!
The rage series was the first series I watched by you ever since then I’ve seen almost every single series this is a new account but I’ve always loved your play style 😂
i would love to play this with my dad, its like the only kind of game he likes EVER!! if your still giving out the PS4 version of the game, i would be so great full if i got a chance to win that! i just started watching your channel as well.
Found you when you made a walkthrough for the first season of The Walking Dead, just to see if it was worth getting or not (Hint: It was). You are a huge factor if I get a game (or system even) or not. Either console.
Found your channel back in the call of duty days peet.

Do beyond the Good And Evil 2
I been watching your vids for 6 years and i play on ps4 and i have been watching since resident evil 6
what RAGE was/is about (note this is all the FIRST game): a meteor called Apophis hit earth, people predicted it so they hid in capsules called Arks under the earth to save themselves. unfortunately the calculations of these Arks went wrong. also one Ark was purposefully designed to rise up early and control the new world...that became the Authority (bad guys). when apophis hit survivors became seperate into gangs and tribes and clans...many of which went mad and had their own views on what Apophis had meant. there were also mutated freaks in the cities. the humans who remained sane set up outposts and homes where they could. Nicholas Raine was the sole survivor of an Ark that awoke far later than all the the others...so he had no idea what everything was...who the authority was...he was just a confused guy in a wasteland of lunatics. The people in the Arks were led to believe they would wake to a new day and together would work to a new age...well that needless to say never happened...because the Authority had awoken first and fu$£ed everythnig up...and started hunting and killing Ark survivors.
Been watching your vids since the titan fall 1 days love all the hard work and great content keep it comin bro!

Great story! Starts off with two apparently popular/ important people. One gets murdered by a door and no one cares.
Wow!!! Just amazing seeing the first few minutes an seeing the head bitten off after the bomb got thrown in the mouth then blew up. Just sick 👍🏻😆..I love it. The weapon choosing is looks similar to resistance an so does the weapons a little bit but wow,this is a Must have game for me..

I've been with you since your original playthrough of Assassin's Creed 3, way back what feels like longer than 2012. My mom had grounded me (I was still in high school ag the time) and the only way I could get my AC3 dose was by watching your amazingly hilarious playthrough. Keep it real Brad!

Found your channel when you played the original rage
I found your channel back on gtaV😂
I love how whichever character you use,  the other one gets killed the right at the beginning. 

But I don't like how the characters kind of treat the whole situation as more of a game,  than them actually going through it. Its still pretty  ig?
Great video! I'm having a blast playing it too.

Been that long since I've subscribed to you that i can't remember what series it was I first watched on your channel
Man, I have just bought and installed the game - watching your intro sold me in the first 5 minutes.  You should get a cut from the sales dude!
3:45 The girl goes to "secure" the door and dies and no one seems to give a crap, lol...Nice immersion...
PS: Some parts of the "Blackout" mission seem like a video colonoscopy.
Found your channel on 2013... Last of us😍

Hi Brad, I found your channel back when you played Saints Row 4 and u have to say I absolutely love your channel. Honestly, at the time, I was looking for a channel with no commentary on the videos, because everyone yells or talks over the dialog but not you. Besides like a lot of people can't always afford a new game and you give me the chance to experience the game and I have purchased a lot of games that you had played on here.
I found this page about 3 years ago

Surprisingly a lot of people requested me to do more of this game so I figured I'd do another part for it. If this one does well expect more. I got some Rage 2 later today and each day expect some Days Gone, potentially this game and Rage 2. Much love everyone
13:38 bruh i thought the sneeze come from the game but it was you all along!
Days Gone: Fighting a horde of zombies

A Plague Tale Innocence: Fighting a horde of rats
Gotta mention, the voice act they used for the child is amazing
13:40 brad sneezes I lowkey thought it was another character in the game 😂
I love the relationship between the sister and brother because they are surviving and living in a dying world.
You can turn on the music, the developer tweeted that videos won't be claimed.
receives flower from small boy

Brad: Nice :)
Brad: sneezes
Me: SOMEONE WITH THE PLAGUE IN THERE!
I seriously hope you play this through completely....im so invested now!!
Brad don't ever ever ever ever stop uploading this game please! I freakin love it
i can't resiste the cuteness of the boy's voice omggg <3 . and the girl accent is amazing too. 

well the voice acting is top overall
Play it till the end!! I'm loving the brother-sister dynamic
Damn, I haven't seen so many killer rats since the opening of Resident Evil: Outbreak.
More! That’s all I’m gonna say...I’m supposed to be working
9:40 the heck? Who invited Ratatouille’s family to this game?
13:44 bless you
"How Convenient" and "Heyyy buddy" are music to my ears when Brad says them
One of the best games I saw in a while really want to see more uploads.
Love you brad. This game is awesome cant wait for the end
Awesome game. Brad Rules. But JESUS, That ANNOYING HUGO KID, "UGH!!!"
In all my life of watching your videos,I never once heard you sneeze until today 13:34
I thought someone actually sneezed in the game.  That was u 😅😅
“Stay near the light”

goes out to call out another monk
I think napalm Molotov would be effective against rats.
Hugo is such a sweet boy😍 the developer did a good job because who would care to protect a little brat lol
"This shit is BANANAS!!" HAHAA ! Right you are my good sir hahaa
y'all if anything happens to hugo i'm fighting EVERYBODY IDC. he must be protected at all cost, ugh my freaking heart hurts for him
When the priest walked away from the light I was just facepalming. Am I the only one disappointed that he died? He seemed like a nice, helpful man.
Thank you brad for giving us the best. Much love fam
Would you rather: zombies or rats?
DAYSGONE was awesome!

Looking forward to another series with Brad! So far this one seems good.

theRadBrad is by far the BEST gaming!
the voice and sound effect of the game is really great. I am going to play the game.
I looked at some thumbnail images & you're right.  They look like the same person.  
This game is amazing!  How many zombie hordes in the past 10 yrs?  10 thousand!  How many rat hordes?  1.  Something truly different for a change!
Hugo is already my favorite 😭😭 he has my whole heart
Remind me at God Of War bruh... Who can relate?
This is great. Keep up the good work Brad!
Not spoiling just a short theory




Maybe the Mom isnt dead since the kid said he wanted to see mom on that cutscene. Idk the Mom is really pretty and she looks strong maybe shes the one who stabbed the guy lol
I’ve been waiting for the continuation!! I started to like the game!!
This somewhat reminds me of Horizon Zero Dawn. And that's a huge compliment! This game looks great :) And I agree with Brad, far as it being better than most of the triple A games that have come out.
nice brad keep up the good work. I like this new content here for games wished i had the money to play them all
Hahahahaha. U sneezed and I was like, hey the doctor sneezed. He is in there😁😁😁😁🤣
keep playing this it's amazing!!! :) one of the best new story drven games I've seen. also, getting eaten by rats for the first time is brutal lol
yep more of this brad keep up the great work.
Brad if u put the rats on the thumbnail it’ll get more views
Hugo is so cute! My heart! 🥰
Black death is the most terrifying disease has ever seen by humankind even ebola virus has to shy away! Im glad i never born that time ..
 HOW CONVENIENT! 😂
BLESS YOU FROM SNEEZING BRAD!!! I got your back!
Tomorrow is my school...
Nah school can wait.
KEEP IT UP BRAD!!
8:44 LOL XD Don't worry monk man, gawd will provide ;) 
Oh wait... nvm :D
Wow when brad sneezed i legitly thought it was in the game
My mans ain't even try to pick up that axe
13:28 I thought it was a character in the game sneezing. LOL
Just finished the tentative final part of Days Gone (NERO ENDING PLS), and then this was released 5 minutes later...

13:40 Thought someone got whipped in-game 😂
I found your channel back on assassin's creed syndicate and enjoyed your channel ever since
4:45 the relationship between these two siblings are really heart-warming, like you can feel the love even though looking back you know they don't spend much time together but the interactions together are captured perfectly, such loving relationship.
Nice... Thanks Brad for Listening 👍
13:38 I thought it was Laurentius sneezing lol

PLEASE DO MORE OF THIS GAME I ABSOLUTELY AM ENJOYING IT. YOU'RE THE BEST!!!
Amercia sounded like Sansa from GOT 😁👌🏽
13:38 thought that came from the game lol
Not sure if in your game setting you turned off the game score, but the game gives such a bigger impact with the score/music on. especially when the Rats attack. Turn it on.
I love this walkthrough it helps me not to be so sad over GOT.
Great content. Ty for uploads. Keep up the good work 💪🙌

This seems to be an amazing game, your vid encouraged me to purchase it today. I wanted to wait for a sale, but a small company that created an amazing game like this should receive my full support.

Hugo sounds so adorable. After watching the first part I looked up the va’s.
Don't stop uploading this series please its amazing😁
this game is actually amazing brad plz HIT US WITH MORE
Bless you lol @theRadBrad😭
Do a reaction vid on the trailer of the new ghost recon, "Ghost recon breackpoint".
This kind of game I will just watch Brad playing rather than buying :)
came here for Days Gone, stayed for the good content.. your voice sound great and the way you play and the fact that you don;t overtalk during cutscenes or when other characters are saying anything makes it just a great experience.
I f*cking love this games, he has a Resident Evil 4 vibe
brad you have to continue this it so cool
such a cliff hanger
Even though this is the 2nd episode, I already love the series!
I'm enjoying the game! Keep up the great job.
Yo Brad when you sneezed I actually thought there is somebody upstairs 😂
You gotta finish this  :) I'm gettin Lara and Zero Dawn vibes
2nd Part was pretty sick with the rats!  Keep em coming mannn!
Funny thing that we all came here from DAYS GONE..life's moving on
I just woke up to see this in my notifications! Yaaay! Can't wait for a part 3 🤗 This game is awesome!
Everything is great! The graphics, gameplay, voices and all!
More of this game it's great and days gone  different ending try and fully complete it please
Honestly Brad is my favorite youtuber and I'm glad money and fame didn't change him at all , same brad I followed few years ago 🙌✅
Don't let the Days Gone love from us fans deter you from posting this game... Please.
I destroyed the 'like' button, just like you said. Now it's not working! 😁😁😁
Im liking the story, will look forward to the next part
Thanks for all your hard work Brad, I was really looking forward to this one. I hope you're keeping up your goal of standing in every video ! 😊
Ok I need more! I'm sorry if I sounded rude 😂
I'm just another bitchy fangirl 👏
this game is amazing. keep doing more!
Another sekiro??? Another unfinished game? We'll see!
YESSSS I LOVE THIS GAME I LUV U BRAD YOU ROCK
Damn yo those rats  you can see all their glowing eyes so creepy theyre really gnarly never seen something like that goddamn
I'm really loving this series so far and it's only the second part! :D
U gotta upload another dude....  The game rocks 😍😍
13:38 I thought someone was upstairs sneezing from the plague xD
damn this lady!! you just dont get it do you!! so slow~!!! damn!!
I prefer this game than Days Gone. Days Gone is so predictable.
Oh please Brad make this a series it looks amazing so far
I’m in love with the storyline for this game! Not sure I like the female protagonist so much, she seems a bit mean, but besides that I’m super excited for it! Keep posting it Brad!
As much as I like Days Gone, I can't watch anymore of those videos. They stretched that game out waayyyy too much. A Plague Tale, looks awesome and I think will be more quality over quantity.
I mean....its alright like

Its NOT days gone tho 😭😭
Just keep up the good work brad!!
Please continue this Brad! I love you play this game, its great!
OMG This Game is very well Done!!!
"Not bad, not bad at all" the SA2 vibes!
Hugo's voice is just pure. It melts my heart.
whos here after watching Days Gone Ending?
Loving the game! Please keep playing! 🎮❤️
who else thought his sneeze was included in the game?
Man we got days gone already great story 
Now this 
Seems like it's brad time this year
Thank you for the video Brad keek up the good work

Please do more of this game, I'm enjoying this.
Great video, Brad. But come on give us a death scene with the rats! 😂
When are you gonna post the next episode. My god, it's been 24hrs.  :P
The Rats in the Walls by H.P. Lovecraft.  If this game ends in an underground ancient cult then, I already know the sequel.  ;D
I'd love to see you play through this whole game. It does seem like it's going to have those puzzle-solving moments, but I think it will also have some chasing sequences and actual boss fights like in the 1st part.
Looking forward to watching you play this series. Probably a lot of yelling at the screen but I've come to expect that Haha and of course the 1st part didnt surprised me when you asked if you could pet the chickens
Thanks for sharing your video on this game. Graphic looking lovely I might check it out. 😉But where is the 3rd part? Would have liked to watch the rest of the game LOL 😋
Keep it up man love this game so far!!!
Brad! I’m looking forward to watching this whole gameplay! Love ya! ^_^
Hey Brad, so far so good. Can't wait for the next part to be uploaded.
its finally here the second part although I  hate rats but this game is so good thank you for uploading, waiting for more parts
I absolutely adore this game, hope you can keep cranking up the videos!
Hoping no outro means you have another part already ! Love this so far
"I don't know that guy seemed like he don't want to be talked to" I was dying😂😂
I really like what this game might become, I ask that you keep playing.
When brad sneezed I thought it was someone in the chapel XD
This game is awesome! Please upload more chapters :D
Honestly it's better than days gone 🤣😁
Great job Brad! Thumbs up on the video!👍
This game is scarier than days gone 




Cuz of rats hahaha

Seems like an interesting story, hopefully you finsih it, Hugo is sweet
I actually love all Brad's video, I don't have any console or computer to play games, so I just watch Brad to know what's the game all about atleast I kind experience that I'm also playing. Thank you Brad for uploading videos and keep up the goodwork!
Really enjoying this game. Upload more please! Waiting for the third video! =)
Finally!! I was waiting for this! ❤️
Please finish the game brad! this is great so far.
I feel lucky to find this Channel. <3
Part 3 please this game is amazing
the end scene 😢💔 ohhh
I thought your sneeze was a character in the game lol
Ive really got into the campaign. hopefully youll upload more often this great game. You have my support.
The "private Video" thingy from the list it's killing me. It looks preeeettty interesting, fo' real..  we all know that can't compare with DAYS GONE, cuz that was beyond anything... and Deak.. ohh Deak...  but this looks like it will end with a plot staging Hugo with superpowers of somekind , being the darkness or controling them...

Can't wait to see more of it
You know flame throwers are looking pretty nice right know.
I wish they made it into a fantastical universe instead of trying to pretend like it's historical. Kind of break my immersion.
Couldn’t play this myself too scared and weird not my type of game but I’ll watch Brad play 

How convenient
Waiting for more... 👌 
Part 3 please
This game isn't my cup of tea, not a game I would play personally
Yay! You won't regret this, it's a fascinating game.
I picture Chris Tucker with the rats!   (Rush Hour 2)
I thought someone sneezed in the game 😂😂😂😂🤷🏽‍♀️
Woop, actually really enjoying this !
I love this game it reminds me of the dishonored 1 game type of vibe. 😌
alolly? i think its the name of the character in HZD
Keep up with this series please I've been waiting to see you play
I’ve been waiting for part 2 keep up the great work
Love this!!!!

This game is actually pretty fun to watch, especially when it's brad playing it xD
This game is really interesting, I might stop watching your playthrough so I can play it myself without getting spoiled. The graphics are pretty awesome, and the story is really pulling me in.
this game is so good! pls continue
I miss days gone.. alot😘 it is best game soo far
I love this game so much. <3 it's a combination between Little nightmares and Until Dawn.
Your reactions are on point with my own. XD so many rats.
Just waited for this series. Love this game & this series 😘😘
Please Brad Keep it up 💕
Dude part 3 .. i like story driven games
keep going do more vids on plague tale and rage 2
Brad always dedicates his life to us and we dedicate our love and support to him for always doing his work😊
This game is Soo Good!!
More Please!
Just right now again! It's been awhile since I followed, but one of the main reasons is that even way back when,YOU kept the cussing to a minimum, which few even today can do or control. It's that ever so small thing that you have that most don't, self control and respect. This allowed me to watch you with my then 4 year old son, opening up his world into gaming. I appreciate it now as much as I appreciated it then. THANK YOU! 
Show less
13.35 He snieze badly🤣🤣
Such a cool game! Hope to see more of it on your channel

13:38 I thought that was a noise from an NPC in the room ahead, but it was Brad sneezing lol
please continue this game <3
KEEP DROPPING MORE OF THISS
Loving this game so far keep it up
IGN gave this game a bad review and people are in shock. People are saying IGN is out of tune. I think they need new people to review games, people who really enjoy playing games and luv everything about it.
Love this game keep it coming
Please upload ghost recon breakpoint
These games are about to make me go completely broke. 😂
What an I doing here I still need to finish the first walkthrough lol
You're  a legend . Love your videos :)
Fitting that the big enemy in a game about the Black Plague would be rats.
13:38 bless u
Part 2 yeeesss my man I really like this game hey
Yeah, I'm curious about the story. It seems like it will be mostly linear, like most horror games.
I love how this game is connected to history
brad please keep playing this game it looks really good and fun to play and are you going to ever finish darksiders 3?
Thank you Brad!  
This is beginning to remind me of Senua's Sacrifice, gripping story with puzzles and a bit of combat.
I used to volunteer at a bird of prey rescue, in order to be released back into the wild, they needed to pass mouse school.  The rescue had their own mouse house where we kept live mice.  When Amicia mentioned the air burning her throat it all came back.  The smell of those mice was similar to opening a bottle of ammonia.  I can't imagine how horrible a crypt of rats smells.
This game makes me think of dishonored in a way cause of the time period, plague, and the person protecting a child.
Continue playing this game, it looks great and you seem to be having fun with it. Love your content man.
YES! KEEP PLAYING AND UPDATING THIS!
Brad mentions kingdomcome and vampyr  this gives me a bad feeling
after days gone i was hoping this game's part 2 show up finally i'm not bored again
after you finished main story of days gone, i just don't know witch one that i want to watching again,
Rage 2 or This??? both game i can play with my pc >.< well guess i gonna watching it both..
nobody expects the spanish inquisition!!
But in reality mice arent scared of light. NYC mice live with people
You have me here from beginning to end. :)
We waaaant moooore please!! :D

It's a type of game that I know I won't buy, but am highly intrigued and curious by it, so even to see somebody else's perspective is more than enough! So, thanks Brad for playing this for us ^_^
The way there is to characters and the clothes and POV give me god of war vibes. The dialogue and looting system to
Dude why is the video lagging every 5 seconds from the ladder scene
If you enjoy it play it.
Just out of curiosity, how many hours does Brad spend a day playing video games? I imagine it must be a lot, which is pretty dope since it's a very fun job to have.
I am not going to play this game anytime soon, please can you do all the parts and finish the game so I can get to see how it ends? Thank you.
More please! It's such a good game
pls finish it brad :)
Please more of this!! We need a break from Days Gone!!!!
I was watching this last night before I went to bed and I can't stop thinking of it. Need moreeeee!
This game is actually pretty good

Thanks for showing more of this game!
My goddamned ocd is going through the roof... I really just want to burn those rats
Bless you!
How many want Brad to continue the plague tale : innocence series then destroy the like button
I think this game is amazing and surprises are yet to come
Love this!!! Hope people but that Like button.
14:28 Heh, she said do do, yes I'm immature...
it sounds an amazing movie keep go on brad😉😉😉
I think the game is awesome
Brad, the lord of cliffhangerland
Hmmmm.Rats in ancient time were bringing the plague with them,so in reality if there would be a plague,we would need to avoid them. Just dont know,what kind of things acording to the game story makes those rats so energetic and fast ? There should be some story about that.
It reminds me of Prince of Persia, Sand of times and the 2008 reboot, with all the puzzles.
That is a GANG of rats!!! OMG
I got so excited when I saw part two of this game that I scared my roommate lol I love it
Dont leave us hanging dude. We want you to finish the story of this game. Need to know..
Really hope you keep playing this!
I hope you do a full playthrough of this Brad.
Pesky rats :p
lol!! Dude when you sneezed at 13:35, I literally thought there was a character around the corner from them sneezing in the game!! lol!!!
After a jumpscare you get a 14:28
I love this game so much more than I thought that I was going to! It really brings you back to reality on how numb we are to killing!
Yes please, Brad. Please do this game all the way through. It'll be more then worth it
Bless you 😉
Finally been waiting since 1st part
Please, upload another video of this game! I'm literally about to buy it because it looks so interesting
I thought that sneeze was in game at 13:40 lol 😂
There is any fight in the game
Get someone with a rodent phobia and make them play this game😅
More of this series please.
Redbrad pls continue the series
Yay you’re doing more! 😆💛
Love this game, keep it up please.
Love this series! Please, finish this game!
I'm really impressed at the voice acting in this game!
i seriously hate the rats in this game ugh! but i love everything else
I really need to see more of this game please brad.
Do more this is so amazing
Ya'll better fricking bring that like button up more so we can get more of this game!
Put a like if you want him to do more of this game :)
i can't lie i'm annoyed i need a PS4 Pro to play this game...i'm very anti PS4 pro (because i just feel games should require nothing more than install/ download and then play...no special requirements like Pro or online only...it feels biased...especially considering that the Pro has to be paid for now). but i still think this game looks amazing and will happily watch others play it so game on radbrad.
also  OH....my...god...
yes please continue this game
I really love this game😘😘😘
I honestly only like when he plays games ‼️
13:38 Bless you ☺🙂
Make your videos longer,please!!!!
It seems like it'll be more linear. You know what wasn't linear though?....DETROIT ALMOST HUMAN!! Amazing!!!
Plz keep playing this brad you’re the only gamer on YouTube that I still watch

OH MY GOOOOOOD THANKS BRO

Look man id be the first  to say not to play these games but i like it... im gonna buy it... the acting the graphic and the story plus its not 60 its like  30 or 40 and it has 13-14 hr gameplay window.. which is amazing.. keep it up man a good series to play.
I am their leader and we are not scared of light we're scared of women with kids
Do you play only one game at a time Brad?
plz part 3 fast
Play ghost recon breakpoint
Dude you have to do more of this game!
3:51 HAH! Fat chance if that ever happens
When he sneezed at the top of the steps I thought it was part of the game!
Make it full series brad......thanks for vid....
I'm still wondering what ate the DOG 🤔
this is just unplayable on consoles, you guys should see it on ultra settings on rtx gpu
lol, when i saw sulfur and alcohol, i had a hunch that there  would be  explosive crafting, then there was a barricade made of wood... put two and two together...
plz finish this game it looks so good
Hmm, why was there alcohol in the church?🤔
Brad you should try and get your audience in to this game like you did with DG . It’s a great game and story it’s so easy to kill and be killed these days in games with no consequences. But this game does a great job making you feel what it should be like or what it is like taking a life.

PS: Can you show the secret ending in days Gone also. Finish all the story’s.
this game looks terrefying xD
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS. I saw the first one today and I was dreading the wait
Kingdom Come Deliverance LOL!!!!!
Can you please spam this game for the ones that do enjoy it

You keep saying you don't know what to compare it too....what about the last of us? How does that compare?
Part 3 pls rad... This is  a good game... Thanks rad
Walking simulator and boring, stilted dialogues. And rats NEVER behave like that. Stupid.
More game!! Love the story so far. I like a lot of the type of games you play so they are great for judging what I should buy next. Just picked up Thief because I just saw your 2014 videos, lol.
Continue this series Brad
Brad, I live vicariously through your channel! I don't have time nor a gaming system so I listen to your videos like audiobooks when I'm studying for classes, and watch them when I need to let my brain unwind. Your always polite to let the cinematics run before speaking. And btw my wife is now very familiar and uses your strugglebus vernacular. Later brother! Love this game! Hope you keep playing it as it's like an awesome novel that you only get to read the first two chapters!
I can't wait for some rage content
Please finish this series Brad I’m already enjoying it!!!
PART 3???
Is it just me or is it really painful waching him not going to ever location in a game
love this so far !!
Would love to see more of this game 👍
This game looks much better than i thought it would
Do more of this series

Yo, I’m a big fan but like I really would love if you do a Zelda Breath Of The Wild play through, I feel it would be great, but if you don’t that’s fine too, I know you have a lot of things you’re recording and working on, but great work and I love your channel!
YEA BOIIIIII

Spoiler

OH MY GOD!!
More of this game please brad
Compared to the demo shown earlier this year, this game seems disappointing cutscene and mechanic wise ( as far as the rat swarms),everything seems half done to me, the story is amazing as far as the characters, just wish more effort was put into the cutscenes if that makes sense
Pls finish!
Please keep playing this Brad!
Man, Brad is so clueless when it comes to playing. I’d be scream at the scream like, RIGHT THERE YOU DIMWITS! CAN’T YOU SEE IT THE DAMN THING SHINING IN FRONT YOU? And he still misses the items 😂
13:25 💀💀
Spam this joint brody :) 💯💯
Love this game now
Stay in the light Mr Brad
I want to be hugo in the last min of the vid
13:40 who else thought the sneeze was from the game
The bite are the black rat that carried the plage from Asian to Europe
to be honest, i really did like this game in the beginning but honestly it's gotten a lot more interested after that whole village chase down :)
Her hair is alot like the chick from horizon zero dawn I think that's why u think she looks like her.
Quit overusing "YO" . It makes you sound like an old white guy trying to fit in.
More!!!!! Brad please more!!!!!

Why the hell did god create rats
finish it
This sucks to see the kids go through this. I like the cute scene at the end.
I wanna see what happens now too
Finish it
Want more
It’s the Mummy all over again!
Hahahah
If the rats hate fire then why didn't they destroy the fireplaces
Bring Back Sekiro :(
The setting of the story is a bit stupid. If I were the protagonist, I would carry a torch or lamp with me the whole time. The stupid limitation in the game that you can't carry anything other than throwables is absurd and do not even offer any reasonable excuse.
why does seeing all those rats make me think of the name Skizzo ;)
Moreee pleaase
I just saw brad litteraly pass by the item on the floor🤣
ja graag super leuk en cool
Awesome brad
The game is to bright....
upload more Brad, please! It's such a good game
Glad he's actually continuing this series

"HOW CONVENIENT!" 😂
BRAD! YOU ROCK! thanks for sharing brother
Thanks Brad I’ve been waiting for this
The voice of Amicia has the same familiar voice actor as Aloy from horizon zero dawn.

Wild episode 2 pops up 
Me: Nope. No sleep tonight.
Can’t wait for the rest Brad. Keep it up
Are you going for 100% for Days Gone?

Brad you are the best🔥💯
Why TheRadBrad YouTube channel is so Awesome.
i didnt realise there were rats in the loading screen until now...
Just switched to youtube and got this at the right time...... how convenient 😂......
And we need a part three made brad😂😂?
i click it so fast lol
Days gone pls
right on time... how convenient
let's do this
REALLY?! RATS!
The Black Death
Those rats remind me of the movie: Indiana Jones: and the last crusade.
i would leave the kid to die. holy crap annoying little brat
I don't like her voice acting :( I want to but it sounds off to me
What is this game about?
bruh i literally just wait every 4 hours and refresh till i see a vid
Uploaded 1 minute ago... just in time. Love you Brad, been a fan for a LONG time.
Lets do this. Brad you are the reason i love gaming so much.. From my primary school day's i have been watching you. Never got bored.
Hey guys, James Charles shouted you out, like to undo or he kisses you!

Hi can u post days home right now
hi
Cmon brad this game sucks
Days gone was really cool
Play another game pleasee mannn!!😢
yaay!
Sekiro?
Good game
Hey brad, i dont know if you knew this but this game was heavily inspired by the bubonic plague during the Middle ages. Hence, the rats piling up during the loading screen. However, unfortunately it wasn't rats that spread the disease it was ticks from these animals that killed 75% of the population. Also, in the last video the people drew an "X" at their door to let everyone know that house has been infected. In real life, instead of an X its would've been a "+" to symbolized that GOD would've healed them. But now, we know that wasn't the case.
This is getting lowkey boring plus this part barely has any likes so luckily he’ll stop playing it.
Is it just me? or the voices of the characters in the story are so annoying.
Is this about the black plague
Spam these. Please.
great video!
Hugo is an annoying brat. I'm sorry to say
Nice
He is the most annoying kid I have ever seen.
Keep them coming Brad, I like the bronze age type games. I love any games like this, as a kid i played d&d every weekend.
Hugo gave a beautiful flower to Amicia because Amicia is soooooooo very beautiful girl, smart, kind, humble, and caring to Hugo so that's why she received a beautiful flower from him.
I don't buy games until I see RadBrad play a couple hours. You've saved me a lot of money and disappointment. This game is pretty good and I will be buying.
Moooooooooooooooore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brad seems to ignore the whole point of this game. It’s to show how used we are to death in video games and she is here to represent that it is bad and shouldn’t be taken lightly.
Yay!
Rage2
Last time I was this early. Brad was starting Days gone.
Big entertainer brad, you only playing for us..... funny but you don’t have to if you don’t like this game, but  doesn’t mean you don’t like  it, if you do go and beat it
they need to burn those clothes before they get to the farm O_O
I heard about this in a commercial but it seems too BORING. WAY TOO RELIGIOUS BASED WHICH MAKES IT ANNOYING. BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN SAN JOSE WHO OVER DO IT WITH THE RELIGIOUS STUFF.
Radbad go play code vein
That boy is a pain in the ass.. His sister got into all sorts of trouble because of his ego
I like it
Looks so boring
0
Puzzles are crap 👎
Im calling it now, trying to like it but voice acting is putting me off, the 13 year old girl (ish) sounds like a mid 30’s Indian lady, the 7 year old boy sounds like a 15 year old schoolboy out of surrey, uk...  part of any story is the ‘immersion’ level, in this case i feel as immersed as an electric boiler heater.. undo the bolts and i’m going to float..  yeah, not doing it, ok story (feels a little dragged out no?) but voice acting is a no no, it should be a “non non”.. but seriously, they couldn’t have found some french people to do the voices, albeit in english with french accents? Yeah.. ok its an indy game but you want me to be immersed as a french heroine? Wheres the ooh la la? The Je ne sais qua ? part of it?
i kinda hate this game mostly because of Hugo. i dont like kids
POOr little hugo...
The kid is kinda annoying
I believe that this series may be even better than days gone
Oh... no... oh... that is rat shit on the walls roof and floor...
This game is great but it’s kinda dumb how for some reason you cant pick back up the torches after you put them on the wall
Bless you
I puked watching this idk if i can continue watching 🤮
Days gone is garbage
I posted a World Record Days Gone Horde video. Defeated a Horde in 12 seconds. Confirmed by the devs lol
I mean yea cool youre playing new games but this game just isnt my style it seems like its medival so yea i hope you play another game though
This game is pure garbage
Appreciate the support on this series! Really means a lot to me. 


Edit: I got the secret ending along with Iron Mikes and Lisa coming up this week so expect more of this game :D
You gotta keep posting this game, it's not over. Finding NERO to speak with O'Brien. He still has so much to tell you. Destroy all the hoards and 100% the game. I've like so many others have watched every video from this series. We wanna see it finish, please keep posting Days Gone. Gotta feeling more story lines are going to open up, DLC's  still very excited for the potential. Thanks again Brad for the commitment, absolutely amazing my man.
I can't believe Boozer made it! Got me all emotional and shit!!!
Find O'Brian. we will see the real ending in this game brad ! and finish it 100% please:)
I m gonna miss that "syphon filter roll" 😂😂😂
There is a secret ending. Finish the FINDING NERO STORYLINE. And you'll see the secret true ending. Rad!!

fantastic buddy really enjoyed every single video i'm one of those who couldn't afford the game well done from the U.K ..........
Thanks for the awesome gameplay RadBrad! Keep it up. You the real MVP
Dopest game I've seen in a while thanks for the uploads bro!
Brad: uploads
Me: Aw shit here we go again.
Thanks dude for playing this for us! I enjoyed every part of it. I'd like to see you top off on all missions even though it takes time to record and edit all the stuff. Wish you all the best and I do hope you keep your channel up and running!
I love you playing this man! Awesome and I would like you to keep going! Great!
Hey man, Thank you for recording this game, i really want it to play but i don't have enough money to ps4 you know haha. Thank you bro keep it up :)
I've been watching your channel since the first telltale Walking Dead game Brad. This was fantastic hopefully you get to play the sequel 😎
This is the first series I have watched from start to end on Brads channel since one of the early batman series, normally I watch the first few parts to see what the game is like but I was absolutely hooked on this game since the very first episode, good job Brad!
You only missed out on some short cutscenes from when you are gathering for the assault on wizard island. I believe if you are at level 3 rep with all of the camps, they will join you.
gotta say thank u radbrad.
u made my days.
days gone is the best game in the 21 century.
plz keep posting more videos!! i watch ever vids u post

find sarah where she will be after the end
Great Game I loved it, i watched it all. Brad your great also man all the best.
Thanks for playing days gone. I couldn't afford it so your videos is how I played. So again thank you. Keep posting some good content man!
I really enjoyed this series!!! Keep playing until you get 100%.
Loved this game thanks for playing it and your the best youtuber
He got his ring back just as he was let go when the militia captured him.
Yo man....just finished watching until only the ending part...I don't do free roam stuff...anyway thanks for an another adventure...really appreciate it
Brad… you are the coolest gamer on youtube. I played my Days gone story and kept on going to watch after how you did it… You are right, the game is awsome.
Wow what an amazing journey thanks for this epic journey brad
Deek: (tappin’ bottles w/his fingers ‘The Warriors’ style)

“Skiiiiiizo... come out to PLAYEEEYAY!
Man this game and Detroit become human. They really are the game that touches your heart. Keep playin games like this man
Thanks Bro, great ride. Be Sure to finish the ending though with O'Brien . CLIFF HANGER ENDING for Days Gone 2.!
That moment you realize what Deacons name means.... 0-0
the horde KILLER 100% please
When boozer suprised deacon that he's alive I was so happy that deak didn't lose his best friend
This game was absolutely incredible. I got so attached to almost all of the characters. The soundtrack was stunning. The story was so gripping and I found myself laughing and crying often lol. I just finished the main story about 15 minutes ago and I’m just sitting here blown away.
I am late but i wanted to say thank you so much for this series Brad! Loved and enjoyed every bit of it!
Wow. This was one of my favourite series of brads ever. Its a shame that I was down under while doing them though. I was asleep when he uploaded every video
I‘am so sad this is the ending, was a fucking great journey!! Love ya all guys!
"give em hell brotha" - boozer 2019 damn. thanks brad for giving us this series. this is the first time I completely finished a 70+ walkthrough and Im glad i did. but srsly brad keep it up
Thanks for the game brad! I dont have a PS4 and this was amazing! I appreciate it my man. See you next time.
I loved this series I don't have a ps4 so my boyfriend and I watched it from start to finish. We loved it thank you for being so active on it! I can't wait for post game uploads!
Great ending. Still gonna watch until you finished... 😘
sometimes your play style is painful to watch but - what the hell - i watched the whole series and that’s a first. thanks brad!

and, yes, the pro reviews were definitely political and i’m so glad your channel with its millions of subs exists to push back against the political bullshit. this was a dream game - like an incredible movie that you can be a character in. so he looked at her ass once and all the zombies were white (did they want the player to be slaying zombies by the hundreds of all colors? these people are insane and should be ignored, bypassed, overcome.) 
i agree - 9/10 and your series - i would have preferred you went into the final penultimate moment prepared as one would in such a case but you beat it and unbelievably, i watched 70 something videos. 
thanks again!
Thanks theRadBrad, I got hooked - you do a great job.
Got off and was relieved but saddened some this was an incredible series salute to you Brad and those who stayed for this whole great experience Radster’s until next time I love Ya And See Y’all Soon
WOOOOOOOWWWW......75 parts!!!!! That’s insane!!!! The best YouTube streamer ever!!! Great job RadBrad!!!!
There's a mission of nero which gives hint about 2nd part. "O'Brian says that more are coming and they're evolving". There'll be a dlc coming or 2nd part of days gone .
Thank you, Brad, for playing this games several times throughout the day! As always, you brought your natural enthusiasm to each video. Thanks again for your genuine heartfelt efforts.
The game isn’t over talk to O’Brian he’s a ...
Please upgrade your bike at diamond lake.
I'm already missing DAYS GONE

You are actually awesome but what you doing keep it up I'll be following you since the beginning of last year I watched you do alien isolation Detroit human I think with days gone it's a very very long game and a people get fed up with it or who's interesting it which is why it's got a low appreciation count but you make them very interesting and very enjoyable keep it up
Well, watched  whole series since part 1. Thank you Brad so much, we want more, curios about that O'Brian mission

What a game and a perfect ending. Really hope they make a second one. Thanks for another epic and super memorable series. ❤
So no joke. I'm not sure if it's because of how long the game was but when Boozer was alright, him and Sarah were alright, and they are rebuilding now. Dude. I loved this series. I hope there is a second one. This was great. Rikki and Addy were cool people to follow. Idk it's just all around a fun series to watch. I binged and waited for you to post a lot. I just sat back and relaxed. Awesome series Brad. I know I'm late but so aweosme.
I've watched all 75 parts and I'm literally blown away by the story and the character development. This was such an amazing game to watch you play, it was beautiful and so story rich and despite all the violence and zombies it was so wholesome. Watching all of them come back together made my heart so happy.

Please, please, please 100% this!
Yaaaas! Wish granted! I've been refreshing all day. :P
I want to see part 100. You owe it to your channel Brad! Thanks!!
Please continue with the series. I've watched from the first episode.

The most horrifying thing to see early in the morning. A series' end :(
Watched you play a few games over the last couple of years but never thought I would watch someone play one game over 75 videos and look forward to the next one being uploaded, great game would make a great movie!  Keep up the great work Brad!

thank u my brother :) this has been an incredible journey
Yo Brad this was an awesome series ... I see you started a new game ..Welp let’s get... 👍🏾. On to the next l...
Awesome job Brad. Watched the entire series and was blown away!!
I want see Ghost Recon break point .. so play the game bro.
A sequel to the game!!! My GOD this would be awesome! Being like them finding a cure or smth. That would be sick
Watched every single video. Awesome ending 🙌💯
This game has been spectacular in my views. And the gamer too <3

You(Radbrad)  stated that this game was given a 5/10. Maybe the person rating might be having a bad time but in my views,  this game deserves a 9 to 9.5 out of 10.
I had watched every single video of this series and I would get too indulged into this that I might not even know what's going on around me. 

Such a awesome series.  I loved it.
Absolutely loved the playthrough Brad. I enjoyed watching every part and hope to see more games like this, played by you.
Deek talks hella low, like theirs not an audience right their
Oh my god I'm so glad Boozer survived. Nearly killed mw when I thought he blew up.
A bunch of YouTubers said that the only thing that is good about this game is the graphics and I agree but I am also pissed about the reviews cause I think this is the best game of the year so far but anyways that's just my opinion. :)
i will miss this game brad plox do more days gone
Man i miss days gone already . Brad try playing iron mike side mission and the other side mission too and the horde mission don't play them until you finsh the side mission first. Love you brad and this game is 10/10 nobody care about the viewrs
BFG Soldier: “I know where you’re at.”
Deek: <shoots the ever lovin’ s**t out of him> ‘I know where you’re at TOO b***h.’ 😁
yes brad plz continue on this series all the side missions and horde stuff
Sad to see is the end. Thanks for playing this for us! I enjoyed every part of it.

I've been struggling the last few weeks with exams and the last uni assignments I have before I graduate, and I just wanted to thank you for this series Brad❤ I've been coming home from work, revising, and then finally relaxing with this series. Your play style and commentary is so chill, you've really done this beautiful game justice. You have a subscriber for life here. Please play more!!☺
Finish the game so much left to do.
i wonder if you had exploded the barrels yourself, then what would have happened (during the fight with skizzo). the ending was kind of... i don't know... i guess was expecting the colonel to put up a fight not get poisoned by sarah.


And please upload horde missions.
Did anyone get chills on 14:40 🤧💔omg Bozeman still alive 😢
Great series!! Never watched your videos before but this game has me hooked!! Keep post videos PLEASE!!!!
O’Brien - alright lets get this drifter and Sara out of here  

O’Brien looks at everyone with guns- oh hell no
I cried when I saw that Boozer's alive :<
I am genuinely so happy that boozer survived
Been on this channel sense the walking dead Ep 1 back in like 2013 amazing how much has changed brad 👏👏👏👏
A lot of the less than amazing reviews were because it didn’t match their political reviews
Yo Brad I totally enjoyed this series it was a wonderful game the only other series that I actually watched from start to end was God of War thank you delivering this to us
Please continue with the infestation, Nero, protecting the weak, or else it will just end like this and making me sad hahahahahaha
Great series. I was hooked from start to finish. Thank you
Just finished the game and it's the best story I've played ever
This game deserves a platinum trophy.
What exactly happen to captain Kouri.  Did he left hes place or it stays,  keep up some f u have free time brad,  it was a awesome and continueng game, thanks for uploading more than 75 videos on Days Gone gonna miss this, Love Vidssss☺☺
Best series yet keep going love your video I'm going to get me a ps4 just to play this
Their is one more ending ... U will get a call from O brien soon n u have to meet him
I have never been this much in love with a game in my entire life. It sucks that it has to end. I love your content do keep up the amazing work.
I didn't know that deacon was the face of an actual actor
I was thinking to say boozer will die 4 episodes ago when deacon told him not to blow up I got confirm but fun fact xd he didn't nice story line hmmm feel like if u had 2-3 more storys to go true like camps would be better doe but hope updates come
That was an amazing series. It's really sad when you finish an epic game. It's kind of like, hell, what do I play now?
Thanks Brad. Really loved watching the videos and got so excited when you posted a new video. Thanks man.
You have to finish all the missions you'll get a cutscene of O'Brian, THERE'S GONNA BE A SEQUEL
Dude you gotta show us that secret endcredits scene with O'Brien
This was an AWESOME series Brad. Can't believe I watched all the videos..You better spam us with them horde missions..can't wait!!!
Please do a 100%!!
Finish the NERO. You will meet O'Brian for the last time when he is infected by the mutated virus.
U r such a good creator, u know when to put in jokes, u r really funny, u stopped talking when cutscenes r happening and I am thankfull for that. And once more u r a good creator and only thing I can say to u is thank u and also i watched all the parts. Keep going Brad, much love.
Genuinely watched 75 eps in 3 days
I don’t have time to play it, yet I watched the whole series 😅 Thanks, Brad! All the best.
Bro u have to see that secret ending yourself and please record your reaction to that cause holy hell what a twist, and a great set up for the inevitable sequel
Finding Nero gets you a bonus cut scene an is probably telling us that there might be a part 2
i am really glad that boozer survived TT, awesome game awesome ending, tyvm Brad for showing us this game, one of the reasons i watched ur vids is because there is always commentary which i really enjoyed, love ya fam <3
We need more Brad back to back
Thank you brad for this journey.
Hey if you do the O'Brian mission, it sets up the sequel, please do a video on it
Yes We Want MOOOOOOREEEEEE. Keep Em Coming Bro...
When u first get to skizo I died multiple times from a gliched gernade . And u go past it like it's on Easy mode. .
Damn  hate to see it end!
Brad - make more videos. For me days gone is like movie with chapters and watching how you explore the world is exiting. Keep going on this shit bro !
Wow wat a game....... More videos of these plz 🙏🙏
BRAD BRAD BRAD! THERE IS MORE TO THE GAME! COMPLETE FINDING NERO! PLEASE POST MORE PARTS FOR THIS GAME! There is either a second days gone coming out or a dlc.
Hey Brad, you should gonna try Horde Killer. you’ll love it 😁
Ha that's funny for a mission name "where's my damn rings"
This game was at least a 9 out of 10if not a perfect 10. Fantastic game
For sure you need to continue at least till ya got all stuff to 100%. 1 or 2 per day would be nice. Game is great and am sad its not a PC game. Keep it up man, loving it
You missed the secret mission at the end bro !
Yo, there's another o'brian mission you should do after this.
Awesome story. Always enjoy your play through videos. Sometime I watch games I wouldn't normally buy, but really enjoy experiencing a different type of game. so glad you like sharing with all of us. Can't wait for Last of Us 2.  Thanks again and keep up the great videos.
Please make the remaining video, the ending part is 75 so make 76, 77....so on till 100%.
Everyone: destroys that like button
Rad: happy noises
What an awesome ending, watched every part and enjoyed every minute. Cheers Brad
Hell ya Brad thank you thank you thank you for this game this game is awesome say hi to chubbs for me
It's finally over 😂 I enjoyed the story more, but I don't like those fade to black transition between cutscene, and some cutscene felt like it's unfinished
The sad part is,every company in real life got a skizzo...
There are about three different endings, which is the reason half the storylines aren't complete. I won't spoil them, but there is a NERO ending; a Lisa ending and an Iron Mike ending. Keep exploring and you'll find out how to get them.
The funny and great thing about this game is that it wasn't actually thought out; it was more of an experiment at first and then developed into a masterpiece.
Enjoyed the series... But after this??? What to see
Best series ever what a great game, if I'm ever able to afford a ps4 I am getting this game.  Keep going Brad, would love to see more.
Straight up dedicated to watching this, in class Rn ⚔️
AT LAST IT ENDED BECAUSE NOW IT STARTED TO FEEL LIKE IT WILL NEVER END
Part 75.. still saying thanks to Sony
Wow.. what an amazing game. I literally felt like I was watching a movie. Thank you Brad for playing this game. I don’t have a way of playing these type of games...so thank you so much. 💜
Good thing I started 3 days ago caz I wanted to this game in one full swipe, didn't really take long just 3 days and I ALMOST caught Brad almost just 5 hours late.
A perfect death for the religious whacko Colonel bible-thumper...
Keep making vids of this series Brad. You have hordes and infestations to clean up bud. Lol
Keep playing if its still fun for you! Id love to see any further game play!
Apparently there are a couple.of secret endings including a very special NERO ending as well as a special NERO weapon. I hope Brad goes for it ALL
Hey Brad, I've been watching you since The Last of Us on and off a bit but you are by far my favorite Let's player. You have a fantastic and positive attitude always and it's quite contagious. I just wanna say, thank you for all your amazing content!
thanks for a good series man, been watching from 1 - 75... most of the time that's not the case, but this time the game is pretty awesome.
Hey Brad, just so you know there's actually a secret ending in the game. If you find it, it'll blow your mind!
ALWAYS MORE VIDEOS OF THIS GAME!
Bravo. This has been a spectacular series!
It's bittersweet to see it end, to be honest. Enjoyed the series so much, man. Thanks.
RadBrad I’ve been through thick and thin through this game with ya all the way and sad to see it’s the end of the game man! It’s been an almost a month but it’s been awesome just to watch! Who needs Netflix anymore lol keep it going bro I got your back
You gotta do the o'Brian mission you get another ending 😱😱
Captain kouri might have a camp out there as side mission
Loved this series never want it to end thanks for posting the game
Such a good game. Thanks Radbrad.
Thanks Brad your awesome!♡
Yea please do free roam and take Down hordes 💯💯
You lost some end cut scene then Brian reveal him self and he is half freak. Days gone 2 you fight Nero
Keep playing, your amazing
DAMMIT I HAVE NEVER BINGED A SERIES ON YT LIKE THIS. Im gonna miss this game. Loved every episode Brad! Hope to see some more crazy games like these you can crush
It's been a awesome journey every single episode's been awesome thank you so much brother 😇😇😇
except for every person who attacked deacon, wrote this right before boozer was like yeah i didnt ruin the game by dying at the end
There’s still a lot more for the ending you have to discover still so this not actually the full ending.
MESSAGE TO RAD BRAD: I admire your dedication and focus to your channel! Nobody does it better! I watched every episode of this game that you did! You sir, are a true YouTube professional and that's really all I can say! Actually, I can say this: THANKS BROTHER!
Lol this took about 20 days 😂 I’ve never seen that before usally it’s like 10 days or somthing
Ty man, great videos.
I thoroughly enjoyed watching this play through and you Brad, looks fun and amazing to play. Looking forward to more Plague Tales Innocence as well, looked very interesting as well!
What a tremendously good game, I started watching the series because I didn't have any plans to play it, plus I thought it was going to be a cheat, not-so-good game. Boy was I wrong! 10/10 love watching your vids. :)
Best game series ever keep it up bro
So how do you get to the secret ending with O’Brien revealing himself? Do you have to finish every storyline?
C'mon brad finish NERO story line mission and you won't believe what is going to happen it ill surprise you nice brad thanks for series
Wow, it was an amazing ending I’ve ever seen hope there’ will be a sequel coming
5:12 *takes bullet to head but casually steps back like it was a gust of wind
Been watching this channel since Last of Us, but haven't really been absorbed into a game until this series posted! 
Great run, sir! Thanks for your hard work and the Spam. Looking forward to more of the game and see you rise to the great hundos on all storylines.
33:29


That lady dove right when you rode past her lol ahahhhaha.

Brad ! thank you very much! it was a hell of a story ! I hope you are gonna do uploads of it until you beat it a 100% ! keep the awesome stuff coming pleaseeeeee
Feel like I just finished a show series :(
Deacon saint john is one of my favourite characters in the last year for sure
Felt like At Last Deacon should have had a Punisher symbol on his chest
Keep doing all the hordes and missions and you'll get a secret o'Brien ending
Enjoyed the gameplay really wish i had a system that could play it and enjoy the gameplay myself 👍
Keep it going!! Watched the whole series.
Bro. are you married? Just asking
Decon st. John the jerk of a protagonist nobody knew they wanted to see until they did
Fantastic series  and an awesome  job thank you so much best series  since God.of war
When i saw the words ending a little part of me just died




Also this game isnt a 5/10 and really needs a sequel with same characters of course
I'm sad the series is over but man this took up a lot of my procrastination time.
"Someone ring the bell..."
This was well worth the two year wait. Great game and my favorite of the year as well.
KiNda wish you’d keep in your fails and not cut them.
Was so happy to see boozer back! This was a great game would love to see you play some more of this especially the hordes!
Wow ,best game of the year 🔥🔥
From start to finish, this has been my absolute favorite to watch. Please 100% the game and take us along for the ride.
Excellent game..... and the gamer too thanks Brad ur awesome
Thanks brad for this series,  remember to cut the alarm off first😆
Sad day, cant wait 2 c u finish the hordes n everything else
I have watched every part of this series thanks for the experience brad
Yo who else almost started to cry but when you saw boozer who else was like,  NOOO HE'S ALIVE OH MY GOD
When the game ends around 21:00 and there still 12 minutes left 🤔
Damn, thats 75 thumbs up i gave you..  worth every click tbh, been a pleasure to watch
I love this series so much but there’s still a bunch of stuff left to do especially with OBrian
I'd give this a game a 6/10
This is the first time i actually stayed and watch brad from part 1 to part 75. Brad ty for filling a void in my life. As a series ends i will continue to watch brad
This game is really underrated!!
yes boozers alive thats actually all i cared about lol
they just don't make this type of game for PC anymore, no micro transactions, no loot boxes, just good fun 10 out of 10
I can’t believe how good this series was! Every day I wanted more parts so I could find out what was going 2 happen. I was hooked all the way through. Thanks for playing Brad really did enjoy watching,gutted the story is over tho lol hope 2 see more videos for full completion 😀 👍 spam away!
Nice job Brad i love it 😍😂
Thanks for making this series I meed to get this game now
There's a secret ending with O'Brian's storyline

I’m glad to have experience this milestone of urs loved this series good work
Do the finding neuro it's a good cutscene and you missed it
this game would be a great netflix original
This game has been so damn amazing! I’ve been following the creators as soon as they announced it and watching them do gameplay and improve it over 5 years. Seeing it all come together into such an amazing game is so satisfying!!
Thanks for this amazing series!
Thank you so much for playing this game for us and for everything that you do, it's really awesome! I really enjoyed the whole game. I'm sad that it's over now though. I would like to see more of the missions that are left also, or anything else that you do in this game.

I've never watched a whole playlist of your videos but this one I flew through and watched start to finish and will continue watching till you get that hundo
pls play it more and do 100%
Please continue 😍😍😍
im not spoiling anything but the secret ending you get from the Finding Nero storyline is 10/10 worth doing
This series was AMAZING ‼️
There will be a sequal. Finish the Nero storyline and you'll see :)
Why your playlist have 79 video?
Please complete the game and do upload videos as usual
Brad: kill them with numbers
Did he mean kill them with math?
Hay brad there another ending where all the camp come and fight with him

Boozer is alive!!! I'm so happy he didn't die.
Do the O'Brian mission it sets up the sequel man
Brad you missed a lotta cut scenes that you might like.... Good play do good brother
Do the O Brian Last... Warning Sequel...!! That's the Ending...
This game was one hell of a ride...pun intended
Thankyou Brad ... Big thumsup from india
Can you do another episode were you find O'brian
This game was so good best game of the year gonna miss it
I have noticed that u shoot way more bullets that needed
I almost cry when boozer showed up
This game didn’t deserve all the hate ign and gamespot are fools
This is one of the game to get back into single players for sure!
This is still not the full ending Brad, complete all the quests to get the true ending
I'd like to see another days gone game coming out
You know with the other camps they would've helped to in the end
Best game ever 10 out of 10
Good job on the series! About 15 vids in I realized why the Deacon character seemed so familiar. The voice actor played the vampire on one of my favorite tv shows, Being Human, were a vampire, werewolf, and ghost become roommates.
Well that was fun last time I was this hooked it was the farcry before last.
I guess Ill see you again for the last of us 2.
You think people watch because they can't afford the game ? In your mind Are they at the library listening with one ear bud they found a persistent cough their only distraction lol
Nar it's cause you chilled AF and get the occasion headshot thanks brad
Fun fact, a blast wave is actually more dangerous under water.
Amazing!!! I am sad it's over :(  the story is crazy good
Thanks for the ride, Brad.
If you find all 18 collectables you get the Syphon Filter Tazer :-)
man im gonna miss Brads "Tactical Roll!"
@theradbrad is this the longest game you have played on this channel?
Do the Nero mission ended hella amazing
I was on the fence about getting this game. Brad, you've convinced me to give it a shot.
There's still one mission you haven't completed! Finish "there's nothing you can do," you won't regret it
No1 strimmer 😎
Brad you're awesome. But can you play another ending where you should had Copeland's  Camp and Tucker's Camp join you in that war?
We definitely need more!!! Please play till 100% done!
Thanks theRadBrad that's some of the best entertainment I think I've had I'm surprised all the editing hasn't sent you quite mad Watched all the parts and they weren't at all bad Well done and thanks from this London lad.
brad, Their is more then just that one ending, if you play more you will get the other ends added too this one - their is a "secret" ending as well
When making  endgame vids can you label them like eg part one part 2 etc etc
BEST 75 PARTS IVE EVER WATCHED !!!
Gotta get that secret ending! It'll change ya!
I'm glad that Boozer is alive. Damn Skizzo
Thanks Brad. I don't have a PS4 to play this. But watching you play this to the end, makes me feel like playing with a friend. You're awesome and never boring. Will continue to watch your other games.
Keep playing till you get 100%, you got all of us behind you supporting this series
Finally the end. It was like watching a movie. Great story , great game and thanks to Brad for the walkthrough. Hope they do sequel.
this game looks like endless...
Wow, what an epic series, loved watching you play this game, watched all your red dead series to and this was more gripping, love the way you let the games roll its like watching an epic movie, keep up the good work, fab Brad 😁
So this might have been the second longest game u played
Thanks for completing the story, been destroying Like buttons like never before haha, usually am the type to drop off after a few videos but this game kept me gripped, you and this game have cheered me up through some bad days, looked forward to it after work. Please do complete the side missions I don't care how long it takes. you sweating during horde missions 😂 and crashing yourself to game over🤣🤣, priceless and hilarious
awesome game and ending way better than GOT this Sunday night lol. Loved this game. My boyfriend and I love watching you play games. This game was awesome We both loved it. Thank you so much for being here.  You did great at this hope to see you play more
Finally a 30 minute episode
Keep em coming, Brad!
I would like to see more end-game content
You need to find the IPCA stun gun pieces and craft it..*in reference to Syphon filter Easter egg*
Who else was happy and crying when you saw that Boozer was alive? LMAO
@theRadBrad,

This series was and still is amazing. I definitely want to see more of it, since I dont own a play-station and possibly a lot of us may not either. It would only be cool to explore more of the map. Re-visit places you been to before to re-view it from another perspective, without the rush that a mission can give. You'll see things you may have missed. You'll find things you wouldn't have because you 'had to run through' that specific area. 



Thus please do, don't stop bringing up some parts. I'm enjoying watching it as much as you seem to enjoy playing it Brad.
I'm going to watch this series again because I love it so much
You have one more ending I think its with nero
plz do this game 100% complete
8/10? Man, you're seriously underrating this game. Been hooked on this since the first video. Please keep spamming us with it until you get 100%. Thanks, heaps.
Wow this game was long brad!
Thanks for another amazing serie.
Brad it’s been one hell of a series, I would’ve never bought most of these games if it wasn’t for you . Been watching your channel for 8yrs brotha talk about Committed Lol . I appreciate everything you do much love .
Bro he did get his ring back. Cap kori gave it back
Glad to see that GOD's plans get once again reduced to insignificance by GOOD people 😉.
this is kind of game that you watch till end then you buy the game and still play the game.
Just keep on playing it dude it is so fun to watch it.
Anyone else have the audio lag?
Max out the bike first
The game got a 5/10 because they gave the critics the unpatched buggy copy, god knows why they did it but thats the reason for the low scores.
One of the best game i played
Amazing series,  great job Brad
I'm so glad that the series ended before we lose wifi
Cmon Brad keep doing the story missions on youtube atleast theres quite a few interesting things left
thank you brad for playing it
The Colonel reminds me of Charles Lee from Assassins creed lll
im way behind on this series and my gameplay is about 8days behind yours
Deacon is willing to fight a one man war against an army for his girl, Sarah can kill an armory with her knowledge ... and plants.
Which one is more dangerous?

Boozer in my opinion is pretty impressive, he survived an explosion from a heavily implied point blank distance.
Brad thanku for playing this series I has been with u from part 1 keep up what you have been doing again thank u for playing this game
Secret Endings?????
I got teary when Boozer popped up. He was a good supporting character.
Upgrade ur weapons shotguns r king in close quarters n throw grenades when it’s 2-3 people togather
👏👍👍😉👽
👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think you skipped the very last cut scene in the credits
its my first time to watch a full wakthrough from brad , i mean i used to watch the first parts of games but this game especially  the story line is just amazing thanks brad for all the hardwork and thanks for all people who supported you through this journey
Maaaaaaaan
I watched the entire series..
Brad get the other camps' trust to max and do this again!!!
2nd series from bras ive watched from start to finish. the other one is god of war
I was not gonna get the game but I’m for sure gonna get it now
Well...GG👍
Ok here's how i think the ending should have gone deek gets a side car for his bike boozer is in the side car with Sara on the back they ride in to the sun set with should i stay or go now by the clash in the background
And This How It Ends
Awesome video RadBrad 😁 I love your videos 😍
Continue the game to see the other ending
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 100% THIS GAME. It was awesome. I don't have a Play Station or the time to play a game like this in the time you did.  You did a really good job. I didn't think much of this game when I saw it for sale in ASDA. I only Watched it because I had 10 mins to spare.   I can't believe it 75 episodes and still not 100%.  Thanks PLAY STATION and Thanks BRAD.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
Now finished the plague tale game brad
Complete the NERO storyline
Do moreeeeeeeeeee pls
How convenient should be your trademark lol
They could turn this game into a movie or tv series
Please do some more Free Roaming and Horde videos!!
days gone is awesome, i have beaten days gone two time and you still have 3 more cutscenne to see, some horde are easy to kill
this was one heck of a ride thank you and ill be watching for the rest of the missions. you are super and i really loved watching you play and i am not sure but ill be here as long as you hit me up and i will destroy the like button. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007 play forever.
Im not gonna say what it is, but there is a secret ending you may find interesting.
Big fan from Indonesia since 2015 😂
Plz upload more videos on this series
Straight up made me tear up. Great series.
What is the motorcycle deacon drives? What the bikes name?
the guy who rated 5 out of 10 has soem big big issues
Im shedding tears, man. What an incredible game this was.
Fantastic game...you were awesome...more!
Game was like looking a 40 hour film, loved it ! Please continue the side missions and HORDES KILLING :)
New record 75 parts 👍👍👍
In the cut scene the bike seems to be completely upgraded
He did get his ring back Brad lol
aw man dude i just kept going on this game its far from over rad brad you gotta keep going trust me dont stop its just starting
Well it's been real Brad Take it easy my friend
You should go for 100 percent brad
I read somewhere that there are multiple endings depending on whether you get the trust level all the way up in all deferent camps or not, and other endings when you finish certain side missions.
Hey rad you should complete the game 100 and meet O'Brien the cutscene is really good leading to a sequel.
You didnt get the obrian ending 
They meet up and obrian warns deekon that the virus is evolving in humans to something more than just dum freaks and obrian takes his helmet off and turns out he is an evolved freak turns away and jumps in the helicopter as it takes off
Hi thank you for the awesome videos loved the great content ive can't wait to see what's next. & can't wait to see what other games awaits
Thank you, Brad. I just finished watching and I must say this was absolutely insane. Loved every minute of it. You had 75 episodes, each of about 22 minutes. If you do the math with those numbers, it would result in over 27 hours of content for this series alone. I'm glad I got to spend so much time with you, and I'm looking forward to you playing more games as well as continuing to explore this one! Regarding the end (spoilers), I was highly satisfied. Loved it. It would have been nice to see Deacon stay as leader of what used to be the Militia with Sarah, and have Ricki and Boozer stay as leaders of Lost Lake. Still, I am very happy with how things worked out, and I'm so glad Boozer is alive and we got the happy ending with Sarah that we all wanted :)
This is easily a 10/10 for me. With all the combat, gameplay, hordes, story, thought put into everything, and pretty much everything you mentioned during the credit scenes, this game was absolutely outstanding. And the fact you still have much more to explore is beyond surreal to me. Loved it, thank you so much for all your dedication, hard work, humility, and kindness. We love you Brad :)
finishing NERO is IMPORTANT!!!!
Finished "Finding NERO" stuff, you will have a "hidden" ending
Please finish this game  100%😊
There is a secret ending when finishing Finding Nero story line,like everybody so that he could see this!!!
Can we get that big 80 bomb?
We all now that that people who are watching are on xbox
O'Brien is a hybrid freak
Yes do more parts i love your series
Boozer and him are best friend goals
This game is 8.5/10 and this was actually from a trustworthy game reviewer from Finland.
So freak-in good, keep up a few vids please
yes keep going we want to see more days gone
Wow we have come a long way😁😁
Awesome game and awesome gameplay...Love it
4/10 
The self commentary wasn't needed when deacon would grunt and grind his teeth not making any sense when he would kill zombies. The body gestures when they would talk out of a cut scene was off and looked weird. The fact you can regain health by killing enemies..soo at what point are med kits even needed? You're basically unstoppable. The story was just for a girl.
Brad it's not fully over. If everything is complete then you'll end up getting the secret ending.
Keep doing the side missions man it gets better
There is a SECRET ending!!
please finish, your not done ... the O'Brien mission is insane ....
I wanna see this forever....  100%.  Everything.
Brad ur just a zombie type of guy
want to see more there a different ending with nero I here
surely gonna miss this game 😭😭😭
I thought deek was having a dream about  boozer
Absolutely LOVED this series!!! I don't have a PlayStation so being able to live vicariously through you and feeling that your gameplay is similar to what mine would be, makes it all the better. I would love if you keep posting more of this game. Thank you for doing what you do, so that those of us that can't afford to play ourselves still get to enjoy in on the fun. Have a great one!
yay!!!!!!!! happy ending
Actor's name Sam Witwer
Thanks RADBRAD.. Great game..
Best game off this year or maybe even ever?
Finally I reached the endgame!
"I think they kick your front door in and arrest you." I like the new brad that lets a little humour out.
YES for hordes parts 🙌
Brad is the real MVP.
perfect game ❤❤👌🏻👍
There is a secret ending just do the Nero story line please I want to see your reaction
its hard to watch al this series but it was worth it LD
cried when i saw boozer
Damnit boozer ! And why do sarah needs a lot of those water hemlock ? She just need a tiny bit of it to kill that sonofabtch.. Anyway the story was great ! Guess you don't wanna mess with a drifter hah.. Wonder what the other camp leader's reaction to deacon destroyed a militia camp
And secret ending part. Do it please
I thought that boozerman died 🤯🤯😬😰
Thanks brad for this series
Man not giving any spoilers but the  secret ending of this game is completely scary and shocking even after I had read the ending on wikipedia!!😶
not done, you haven't unlocked the true ending, i have seen it and was gobsmacked.
It's so funny how the reviews all called deacon an asshole and said you couldn't really relate to any of the characters or anything. Deacon and boozer were my favorite part of the game their story was fuckin great
Well done RadBrad...great game.
Deacon's epic speech:

"I'm not a leader..."

Random guy: "damn right!"
please keep goin man!!!!!
Thank you for posting this videos I'm in high school and its finals week and your videos helped calm down from all the stupid work in school
You just ended and i just started
"YEAH IRON MIKE! IRON MIKE!!"
The nostalgia from completing another theRadBrad Lets play

I would like to see more gameplay
Your the best youtuber on youtube brad
Dam sad it ended but loved the story 👌
10/10
Thank you for all of these videos and all of your time that you put into these videos I appreciate it and what makes you my favorite YouTuber over all is because you interact with your subscribers a lot more than they do they just try and sell merch and then they throw on a video as for you you actually interact with your subscribers you ask them what they want out of the videos and things like that that's what makes you my favorite YouTuber and keep it up man love you
I’m so sad the series ended. I waited for another episode
The credits is a boss fight
This is one of my favourite game I've ever played and completed tried doing the hordes they extremely hard you need a lot of bullets I'll give this game a 10 out 10
Haven’t you Seen all the special ending for the game yet. There three more then the one you did they are interesting
MMOOOOORRRREEE!!!
Nooooooo 😭😭😭
What will I watch?
I bought my copy 2 weeks ago only done a few parts been busy with life etc but recently bought an Xbox one X and been playing rdr2 in 4k. Can't put it down lol.
You should do the secret ending with o’brian
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! IM NOT READY FOR THIS😭😭😭
Spoilers.. after you beat the game, there are stronger and bigger hordes everywhere, gets tough but fun.
You have to finish finding nero!
we want moreeee love u brad
I want more brad that all i ask from u... 😁 😁
Noooo it's not the end is it ??? What will I do now ? I guess I'll have to buy it and play it for myself
Do more NERO
Ending came out in my bed time :( But it's fine though!
Love you Brad, the choices you made in-game were probably the ones I'd make, I don't have money to afford a game, let alone a console, lol. It's been one heck of a journey, been here since Dark Souls 2.  Its good to see that you haven't changed. NEVER use a webcam NEVER, if you're going to start a game that's like 50 parts long, it's not like we don't want to see your pretty face, I'd love to see you bring back your VR days.. It's just that without a webcam, it feels like playing the game, lmao Thanks Brad, for being such a great guy and for playing the games for us~!
And again- congrats on 10 million, haha! 
Love you Brad!
How did they end it without closing the Nero part of the game?
Darn it, I was tears to learned Boozer make it. Hahaha...
I really wanna see a maxed out bike all weapons bought and all hordes and infestations removed
Brad I loved the series
Dude the horde scared the shit outta me and it was 4 in the morning and I shattered my phone screen😥😂
So good seeing Skizzo bite the dust
I am so happy I watched every single video and followed the whole story. You the shit rad brad! Please go 100% everything on this game! It’s soooo worth it.
I thought boozer die and he appear i was like wow,mind blown.
This series is the reason I’m buying a PS4, this has been the game I’ve been waiting for! Now that I’ve seen it all and everything it has to offer, I fell in love. Now I’m out 300 bucks
I'm happy for Deacon and Sarah to have each other back in a teenage dream couple even after everything that has happened and them splitting apart from each other while making a plan to survive the tough life those two have such young love till death does them apart just as amazing couple just like Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher 👫
PS4 pro like ur pro
Everybody destroy that like button, lets get more likes then part 1.
I need to see hordes and finishing of the rest of the game!!
Please continue playing
This game is 10/10
Please I need at least one video a day until you hit 100%
Play more and there also is a secret ending with O’Brien
Bring the hoard in any camp ;)
Last part and my mans still hasnt upgraded his stamina, and only has used a handfull of guns. But i dont mind it was a hell of a ride.
Wish this was bot just a ps exclusive would like to play this game.
Who ships addy with weaver
I agree with you that this game is going to be the best of the year or one of the best. Everything about this game seems to have that amazing quality and a story to go with it. I can't wait to play it and experience everything for myself. I really do wonder if they're gonna make some DLC for this and if they do I can already tell that it'll be great. I just wish that the reviews for it actually were as good as the game itself. Can't wait to watch you fight the hordes and do more of the missions and side quests.
The crowds responses are so unrealistic. It doesnt even make sense. Where are the people who gave up in the militia? Other than the wounded of course
9:50 my throat suddenly got very sensitive
Almost cried when Boozer showed up
FINDING NERO FOR A COOLER ENDING
more pls brad xD
I love dis game plees keep an plying

I love you fam!!!!!! Love the series!!!!!
great series brad
You are amazing thanks for giving us those amazing seiries keep playing this game plz
Go do the secret endings
Great video...Just want to add that if your trust level was high enough the other 2 camps Copeland & Hot Springs would have also joined you in the final battle and been a part of your speech etc...
Just happy boozer lived.
Ur the main man 👍
Happily vouch for the story!
3:15 got to mark first😂
Man this was such a great game I just wish it wasn't a PlayStation exclusive
YOU NEED TO FINISH FINDING NERO QUEST

There's another ending, in case you're wondering.
the second time i cried after titanic
More video brad
Dude we love ur vids
Bye Bye days gone
You miss a secret ending
kori gave him his ring back a few episodes agao
I think whoever gave this game bad review was probably leftist. This person could find this game very supportive towards the gun laws. The Second Amendment of United States Constitution, right to keep and bare Arms was mention in the game. Or something else, but I'm sure this was political. Nowadays everything is so polarized by the political climate. And you can see effects of political correctness in all forms of art. Artist can't create freely anymore and this pains me greatly.
For some reason I’m not getting notifications
Fantastic game. Thanks Brad.
Thradbrad keep playing the game and at one point the nero guys calls and it changes everything
Well that was anti climatic
I'm kinda sad that this is over
Nooooooo i wish it jist kept on going forever
Game is underated because of bugs
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO BOOZMANS DOG!!!!
I am going to miss this sieries it was to good to be true...
Who else here from part 1
I have enjoyed every min of this please please play the rest o the stuff...
I miss this alredy
yo wheres the post credits scene?
Full finish! Plat this baby
you have to get secret ending
“He never did get his ring” yes he did Brad, wasn’t you there when the Sargent gave him it back?
Does this mean we're going to get more plauge tale
Can’t believe it’s over....so much time invested. What next? Socialise? Work? Sleep? Lol all what I’ve lacked since this series started
MORE DAY'S GONE!!!!! PLEASE
The so sad this game is over i wish they had so much more
pls upload side missions brad
More!! I need more! Pretty please?
Such a great story sad to it end
thanks god days gone series ended. so now please play the plague tale!!!!
Are all the freakers died?
i loved this series
Gotta love it how some loudspeakers on Nero checkpoints attract a shit ton of zombies but a huge bomb and thousands of gunshots brought nothing
More!!!
Anyone else notice daniel radcliffe's name during the credits at 23:13. Apparently he did some art work.
Extra  part
Do the bounty missions need to be completed or are they optional?
Id love to see him play online lol and do a team takedown of a horde
ignore the 45 arseholes this game was awesome makes me want to start gaming again
I am one of those people who can't afford these games when they first drop. So I'm one of people who really appreciates what you do. Thank you radbrad, for bringing these games to me. It's an honor to be a follower
Sat through this game series with you from ep 1 to 75 and didn’t lose interest, literally don’t regret the hours watching this such a great game , and your such a great person aswell
DO THE SECRET ENDING WITH NERO
I think its not over yet :(
Best series yet.
2nd game?
7:03 Rambo?
Please finish the big quest lines with Nero etc
Noooooo why is it ending😫😫
keep going
So brad ....we going loud n proud for the ending huh?....
You didn't talk to obrian yet!
This story was so good.. the best I’ve ever seen in a game... this highkey could’ve been a movie.
Keep it going!
Keep playing this game there still more
Games with a compelling story are the absolute best games! It's the reason The last of Us was such a hit and it's the reason this one is going to be a hit too! It really holds the attention of the player and viewers! Thanks for playing this for us Brad! Every video was amazing!!! You're the best! We appreciate you so much!!
What an awesome story and game, thanks for playing this through to completion. ive been waiting to see you play this game since you released that footage from the E3 trailer a year ago, you did a great job as usual. ive been watching and subbed to you since Ryse: son of Rome/ Dead Rising 3; no other gaming channel is as positive and just enjoyable to watch so congrats on those 10 million plus subs you deserve everyone of them and more. Say a big ol' Heey buddy to chubbs and pet that dog for all of us.
more!!!!!!
The game like a movie it you think about
Awesome series Brad really enjoyed it!  And who the hell would dislike this video, I mean common guys?!?!?!
There are 3 other endings...got to finish the stories. I can't wait. Pretty sure there will be a sequel
Throw a grenade or something!!
Why don't they make an online zombie freeroam game
Let's get this
Please continue the series
Loves your videos
Man great series
I don't understand the rush to complete the game when you have so many high view counts on each vid. I'm hooked on this game so I'll watch whatever u post but for a lot of people this series is now over. You could've milked this game for so many more vids because the ambush/marauder vein gave you recipes for all types of melee weapons. I bet their are people intrigued on the question mark missions. The ripper girl storyline looked very fascinating. On to the next game!
Great series sucks we won’t see anymore days gone from you
well those are some quiet credit scenes...
WHAT ,THE END! I’m sad now
it's not a one way trip
Honestly Skizzo deserved worse way to die!
Isn’t there other characters and stories on this game
GONNA MISS THIS SERIES NOOOOWWW!!!!!!!!!
Nicee another uhmmm now rage 2
So this is some Netflix shit in a video game.
🥺🥺😢😢😭😭
Boozer made me cry
I don't really like to like videos on YouTube. But this one deserves one from me.
A sad day today
Yes pls keep playing! I will be with you for 100%! I haven't even played it yet but just watching you, it is SUCH a good game. A friend I've had for nearly 20 years is a self-proclaimed redneck (like when I met him his family in 2001 they still had an outhouse), and just the little cultural details and mannerisms they've gotten right have blown me away. And you taking the time to explore the angles and actually give the audience time to see the characters and build a love for them instead of just stomping through the dialogue? Thank you.
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTHER YOU LIVE!!!!
What about Copeland  and the other girl in the camp
Awesome series man
Wait what? Wow
Really enjoyed this series
Theres supposed to be a secret ending
Skizzo is the great, great, great,great, great, grand son of Micah!
I saw daniel radcliffe show up in additional art, was a he a face or voice for a random character?
There is still 2 more endings
Do the Nero mission please do it
I watched every single second of this serious, the first time I have watched a whole serious and I LOVED IT! Best story I have seen since Bioshock infinite. Brad I will definitely be watching more of u, that first video of this game was the first video I have ever seen of yours but I love your game play and how u play ur great thank you because I don't have a PlayStation and had been waiting for this game but u gave me the experience.
thankyou man
loved this
Please do more
Thank u radbrad love ur videos
woooow  its amaizing we finish it
Get the secret ending
Finaly we did it
Had to cut me a piece of cake for this!
I have a question is what the puppy alive
After the Nero then you should stop
Do another horde mission
Road to 100%
I think there is 4 after credit endings
Thanks brad :)
get the secret ending man
Please play the last of us 2 when it comes out
Its been a pleasure.
There is still an ending to you safe now
This game is awesome. For me it's up there with Uncharted, The last of us, Far Cry and Red Dead Redemption. I hope to see more games from them in the future. The critics who gave it 5/10 reviews should be fired. 9/10 game for sure 👏
Skizzophrenia
Here's the end 😢
Amazing series
Boozer IS a BADASS!!!
Imagine this. Last of us/RDR2/GTA had a baby and named it Days gone
Made it finally
Id love to see more of the horde fights
I like the game overall but it gets a little repetitive with rescuing people.
Please please PLEASE do all the free roam stuff
What a ride!
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This games not done there's more the one ending to this game but thanks tho cuz I never seen this one
Can't believe it finally ended...
I bet theres going to be a sequel to this game but more evolved.
Well here it is 😭😭😭
nooooooooooooooo
part 2 of plague tale?
Theres more then one ending and one secret ending
play more
You shode finish the o briyen part i have seen spoiler s

Overall its a great game! I give it a 9 out of 10! Keep pumping out more videos, I wanna see the hordes get destroyed and all the other storylines as well...
congratulation
Days Gone baby let's gooooooooo
It finally here the end
Im gonna miss this game😢😢😭😭
Don't know about the other 10 MiLlIoN subscribers, but I'd love to see more. Absolutely no reason to destroy any chairs, throwing that b-ball up for your signature comment. Bless brother from another mother, and Let's do dis!'.... Ps. Your channel strengthened my relationship with my brother, made me a dedicated ps-gamer. PSN-fRoGsToNe-
Awesome game.
Bru more
I wish Xbox had exclusives... 😥
why are there no subtitles on some cutscenes?
Dont tell me this is the last video on days gone😟😟
Secret ending
This was a great series, probably the first full series I've watched on your channel. It probably helps that I'm a Pc/Xbox user and this is one of the first PS4 games that I actually wish I could play through myself. Most of the other 'big' PS4 titles I've watched and thought yeah, that's cool, but I don't need to play it. This, however, even after seeing the end - I still have an urge to play it at some point.
we want more brad..
Go after the horde with the auto shotgun😂😂
More is good.
Great job Brad
More Plague Tale please!
Yooooooo
swear deacon doesnt sleep
Why did it end
I can not thank you enough Thank you very much
There is more ending
16:50 who da hell is Jack?
can you take out all those loud speakers at the Nero site?
can I have this game after you finish it?
Hoard missions
Thanks Brad
Great game and as always a pure pleasure to watch you play it. Would love to see some horde runs, and other missions. Great work Brad.
Quite possibly one of the top 10games of the decade
come to this i wish it would not end . the game is so good getting better and better. thanks brad for the fun all though out the series
Do side stuff
Please more
more!
Do the Nero missions
cool bro
You gotta get to the last O’brian cutscene!!
This was the best game I have ever seen you play in all these years of watching you, Brad! I normally find zombie games boring, just too many bullet sponges and not enough characters to care about but this game has such depth and breadth of story and so many different missions that are all linked together! Fantastic Game! I am just sorry it is over. Hopefully, they will make a DLC and additional stories.
Would love to see more xx
More sir
Uptop
thats the thing brad, some games and movies great to the people who love it, but critics hate it idk why people see all of it and only look for the good parts, but critics look for the bad stuff that's the problem with number ratings
Plague tale of innocence
RADBRAD
MORE
Finish the Horde Missions Brad
More parts, more parts, more parts!
l want more
Thank you so much Brad! So AMAZING game, Love from Sweden ❤️
Hi Brad, please complete this game 100%. Want to see more videos of this game. Who knows, u might get some special weapon for completing game for 100%
I'm saving this for when I get back from work - thanks for the series! Really enjoyed every minute of it.
i love you Brad! i really wish this game was on PC and was multiplayer cause holy crap the storyline is amazing thanks so much Brad for bringing us this
Thank you very much Brad for this amazing series. Some of us can't afford or have the time to play games like this. So watching it on YouTube with your commentary really makes it worthwhile.
I waited each day eagerly for your videos to come out and always left craving for more after the daily dose of 4 videos 😂. Thanks again. Keep up the good work.
I'd love to see 100% completion, please!!!
Hey brad at the end credits of games, put some trap beats in the background 😎. That's what I do big dawg
Outstanding. This one I just may have to watch from the beginning again. Thx for this.
i don’t know if a part 2 is coming for days gone, or a movie. complete the nero story for lore. DLC is confirmed, so do it!
I've been watching these nonstop and I'll sit there with the TV on waiting for updates 😄
In my opinion, this game has some amazing voice actors, especially deacon.
I’ve been watching your videos since I was in high school I’m grown now with a family  and your sir is apart for my family
Keep going i wanna see the of the neru
Awesome series and you did a wonderful job Brad.  I hope you finish it completely.  I will be here to watch it.
still alot secret ending for this..
A crazy concept for part two would be if they went back to deacon and boozers days as bikers
That was a great ending to a great game!!
I hate it when things end :O what a great game though :D I am definitely going to play it :D
Do more please
WE WANT MORE WE WANT MORE
I've waited for this gameplay for 84 years..... Genuinely loved this series and will be buying the game now thanks brad
Was a awesome series brad.. been wtih you frompart1..keep up the good work.
Thank you Brad for your endless efforts to provide us with the perfect gaming experience. There is literally no one else like you on this planet❣
This was an epic journey and I'm glad I was apart of it
Spectacular series Brad and i managed to watch each and every episode of this series. It was a lovely RUN! :) :) Keep us entertained just like this !
How come you give this game a 5!!..this game had everything right..the start..the ending..the missions were engaging...overall the game was phenomenal.. 8.5/10 from me
The nero ending where O'Brian happens to have done something....is a potential sequence to this
Love jou vids l have a struggling channel l do not know what to post

Are u going to keep playing a Tale of Plague?
Brilliant series brad thanks 🙏🏽
😭 I didn't want to click on the video I don't want it to end!!!
I don’t think that they’re hasn’t had a game that hasn’t got you more emotionally involved since the last of us.
Despite him not really figuring things out most of the game he made it fun to watch. Even if it was irritating beyond belief at some points. Wish this game was released with more polish at launch. That would've helped a ton.
"ALLRIGHT GUYZZZ" What a way to end the series Man!!! It's Been Outstanding and I was so very Mesmerized by the way game unfolded and thanks to the entire "GONE DAYS" TEAM for pulling off an absolute Wonder. Brad-the Man, you been wonderful and was eagerly waiting for each n every part every day. Fantabulous Job Man..U rocked the Show..To be very frank with you, this is my first "Youtube full series watch" for almost 12 years. U did what's required, kept everyone of us engaged till the last minute. Kudos to You for letting us Know about this UNDERRATED GAME and also for playing it. LOVE FROM INDIA. KEEP ROCKING BRAD.. HOPE TO SEE MORE OF YOUR VIDEOS .........................

THE END OF DAYS GONE ON PS4
No more Jack the dog?
Absolutely brilliant love every second of this game 5/10 is so ridiculously and definitely not what I think the youtube/ actually players would vote for. I only watched you play it but definitely would say 9/10 or even 10/10 . Thank you Brad and Sony for such an amazing game
Craziest game of the year
Get the secret ending finish finding NERO
i want more
Yup. Sony Bend have a new Franchise. Looking forward to the sequel of Days Gone.
Brad, Man, thank you for this series. 
I wish best for you man, following you since 2013 ✌🏽
thankyou brad
for your effort to bring this game till end
Please do more videos to this game. I’m loving the game 
Thank you for all the time and effort you have put into this series 
Keep up the great work and Let’s Get This
Thank you for one of the best experiences in my life. This game got into me from the first episode, and I can say that I loved every single one of them, loved the way you played it and much more I loved the series. That ending was spectacular and I'm looking forward for more from Days Gone. Thank you RadBrad <3
Brad, the game was awesome, but you had a lot to do with me coming back for more.  Love your style of playing.  Let's get this 100% done.  I am here for it.
Just keep uploading, we keep supporting❤️
The best ending in a game,this one and assasins creed odessy
It’s finally over.... I feel... empty. Yet whole. HOW CONVENIENT
Series Since Part 1...Was A Good Series... Call Of Duty Series, Assassin's creed Series, NFS, and Now This.... ✌️
Kinda disappointing you didnt even get to fight skizzo or the colonel. Oh well.
I think they already made a second part to the game where things get restored and another country helps them. The ending just leads into another part.
There is a lot open for DLCs or a sequel... Sarah wants to find cure, and there’s the stuff related to the secret ending after you complete “Finding Nero” that leaves us with lots of questions and expectations!
Please 100% it, amazing series
Really want to see more game play especially the hordes
Continue the plague tale please I want to see more pls even this game too
Next big game dying light 2
Bonus videos!
Pretty boring ending with mainly cut scenes...
:(
Thank you Brad. Been an awesome journey. Can't wait for more horde killer video's.
Man,I can't believe were here at the end, 75 parts this was a long journey,gj brad keep it up brother
thx for that awesome journey Brad, was a hell of a ride, and definitly hope u do the rest too, realy enjoyed this one alot ^^ keep up the good work, and we will always keep supporting u ^^ much love, stay safe <3
Days gone was a fantastic game, I enjoyed every minute watch it, Brad you did a great job on this series. This game deserves a 9/10
Yes, we need more, Brad. Meet Lisa. Kill some hordes. Try to complete the game 💯%.. We're with you.
The game storyline was excellent! Loved all 70 something parts. However I think the last boss fight was weak. It should've went harder than it did. Good game overall. 💯
I watched all the seris really enjoyed thx
Man the Story mattered to me this ending was awesome and I was crying when I saw Boozer alive and I was crying to see a brother in Boozer that's just proves that this games story was Fantastic to immerse us into a 10 out of 10 game, enough said man
masterpiece great work congratulations to the creators!!!
If you ever replay this, try to get Copland and Hot Springs to level 3 before the final fight, not only will you get a different cutscene when they band together to ride south, you’ll also see another characters in this final cutscene when they ride back north, like Copeland and Many, Alkai and so on... Abs yes, play it with soundtrack, the soundtrack is amazing!!!
Yeah Boozer’s Alive Never Felt So Good!!!
Theradbrad hello. God bless you and your family. Happy Mothers Day to your Mom everyday. I have a question for you. Would you think about going back and play Sniper Elite V2 updated version? You are a bad ass with the sniper rifle.
best single player game I have ever seen.
what an amazing game. I really cried in the last video when we all thought Boozer died. What a story and what a game. i cant wait to go out and add this to my collection. Congrats Brad, you have done a fantastic job, keep doing what you do

Thanks ❤❤
Great zombie series
Jes more parts
yea more videos
fim more videos dudeee i wana watch horde videos
Someone make brad crashes compilation please
That how I shoot without auto aim
Yo Brad, do the hordes and the rest of the storylines.
I would have to say that's the longest intro you talked in a game-ending I don't mean this in a bad way but I've heard you say more things in this game that you never said in any other game series that you've done what's different is is when you talked in your videos you're talking about the game but in almost every video in this game you talked about just anything I know I always talk about small things that you said or whatever is because it's just to me it's different you're the only YouTuber I speak in comments and I also follow some big-time YouTubers but I don't say nothing to them I just had to say my parts for the end of your series here I mean I didn't like talk to you or nothing but I have OCD I have it pretty bad and I have to do things a certain way and you just have to understand that I guess .  I make content everyday I have so much s*** that I do I don't even know what how I have time for it I personally do too much but I enjoy what I do I've been doing it a long time back when I started there wasn't no computer all tape  :)   alright Brad you're the best don't get it twisted
Its Not Finish YET
brad has literally zero upgrades of 'focus'
also brad : that thing's accuracy is so bad 3:30
Im so sad this game is over Brad dang it was beautiful an great good job bro loved it
That surely was an epic journey with a epic game...loved every minute from part 1.❤❤
There no end...they gonna fight super zombie next DAYS GONE 2
I wasn't expecting this uplaod will be the ending feeling so sad 😔 but thanks brad for giving us this epic journey/series ♥
The end of a beautiful story 😞. Thanks for making these series Brad. I finished the game 2 weeks ago but I stuck around and watched all 75 parts aftwards
Been here from 1 video to 75th videos love you and your gameplay radbrat😘😍
Voice acting a bit poor. Also ending was a bit anticlimax. Ending felt like depending on choises naturally different clips but it felt like rough cut jumps to them. Not flowing.
PLs keep playing for everything rad <3
Watched every minute of this and absolutely loved it ❤❤❤❤
Thanks Brad!
This game was an absolute roller-coaster, thank you so much for playing it!  I'll watch this later when I can appreciate it.
I've been watching "Alien Isolation" to help keep me up while studying.  Whatever happened to "oh my sweet buttery Jesus?"
When the zombies are attacking you some of them sound like smeigal from Lord of the rings.
It's not over yet Brad!!!! Keep going, you need to talk to o'Brian!!!!
Thank you for every episode so far!!👍👍👍👍
It was the longest series u played on ur channel . Congratulations on completing this lol.
Why dont you use the scan thing, it highlights enemies.
Once again you have outdone yourself with another great series. Definitely my favorite this far in the year. Been watching for 5 years an have enjoyed each game you have played. Your the best Brad until the next series. 👍👍👍👍👍
Awesome series! Loved the game!

I’ve been here since the first video 👌🏻 it was a great series, thanks brad

Loved the whole series... Lots of love @theRadBrad
High key glad boozer made it lol last vid I thought he was really out out
Yo brad keep those videos coming! I enjoy your videos and I’d like to see more horde take downstairs
Nice thing to come to after a rough exam
Please give us more A plague tale innocence. Love the ending of this game sad they didn't set up a sequal.
Damn 75 parts i have been here for all of them if i had a ps4 i would def buy this ehh maybe i ll get the remaster on the ps5, yeah def down for more parts
Make another video before you start other series
Yessss boozer I knew it.

Dear radbrat please take the automatic shotgun or that what it is called for the horde mission.. Please
O'Brien mission please
Im sad its over but i loved wathing yours and only yours cause yours was the longest i seen on youtube

Should be a DLC that allow u to build your own camp.... What you guys think?
Nice 👍 brad what a nice adventure. Thanks for awesome game i love it keep going finish the game we support you brad👏👐
Hey brad please make a video of unboxing of ur diamond play button
That was one hell of a journey. Thank you Brad for taking us on it!
Love u brad for the amazing series🙏keep it up and upload more videos👍
Damn rad what a game. I've been here since 2011 Dead Space, and holy crap you've come along way. Loved this series loved your cpmmitary.
If you continue posting this game, I will continue to watch them.. Would love to see u get 100% on the game.. THANK YOU for a job well done...
Thank you brad for finishing the game.
There's the post ending mission where it shows O'Brian real face
I have watched every minute of every video.  Thank you so much for taking the time to create these!  I would love to see more!  I so wish this game was also for the PC...............  Again thank you for doing this.............
Hot springs and copelands camp supposed to help too idk why they are not on the cutscene when all was forming
By the way Brad, awesome job on the series! Thank you! Although I beat the game in a week (which never happened before, I just couldn’t put it down, I honestly also don’t understand some of the reviews), and although I am on my second playthrough on hard, I still watched every single one of your videos!
Brad please play A Plague Tale: Innocence next, please complete it. It's a very good game.
Brad  please do the secret Ending with OBrian
Hahaha yeah take that skizzward you coward.
IT was a really great and awasome   game 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼. It were really chilling series to watch . Really like to hear your two words ' HOW CONVENIENT ' during the vedio . finally biggest fan from INDIA . KEEP IT UP. 💖💖💖💖
“I can help I’m a doctor” 😂😂😂
Please finish the game to the end
Men I cried at the ending
Nero secret ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!  @radbrad
Noooooo 😩😩😩😩 av enjoyed this one
Brad been grinding this amazing ass content for our entertainment. I think i speak for most people when i say thank you Brad.
Been sitting on your page for 10 mins waiting XD. I think I'm ready for it.
ONE MOR PART! I can’t wait another 12 hours. I’M TOO IMPATIENT!
Brad: gets tackled off his bike by a zombie
Also Brad: complaints about not trading insurance
You did a mistake Brad. You should have maxed the trust level on all the camps you would have gotten a different ending
brad you forgot about the other 2 camp tucker and Copeland if you finish their quest completely they will show the scene tucker geng, copeland geng and iron mike geng will meet up 10:10 and they follow you to battle and if you did this actually the ending i believe is that you had united the 3 camps together
Don't quit right away after the "main" ending, wait until you've finished the "finding nero" storyline. Keep up the good work!
I won't believe Boozer is dead until we see a dead body on screen. Nope, I refuse.
Brad please play A Plague Tell game fully 😀😀😀😀. We want that. Love you bro. I'm here since Injustice 2.
Deacon wants to find sarah


We want to find out how it ends
I thought cope's camp and Tucker's camp come along....
Darn, looks like you missed out on having all the camps help you.
1 view 19 likes and 5 comments ok YouTube's drunk again
With this episode

Days gone is now officially the longest series of Brad in his channel
Damn if you completed the camp missions beforehand you would have Iron Mikes camp, Tuckers, and Copeland’s gang helping you out.
This video has 0 dislikes so far, KEEP IT THAT WAY!
Edit: Ladies and Gentlemen, we FAILED
It's very enjoyable watching you play this game! Thank you for the amazing content!

If Boozer dies this game went from my favorite game of the year to my least favorite😂
Hey brad you should do all the endings
Saints row the third was your longest series
WHY DIDNT BOOZER FAWKING JUMP
I wonder how bad it is for the past week or two  that I need to watch a Days Gone video as soon as it is released. I literally make time at 11am, 3pm, 7pm, and 11pm. Thanks for making it a cliff hanger to 😂😂

There was a much better version where you bring all three camps to fight at wizard island.
Plzz buy and use the SMP9 gun it was amazing
Is nobody going to say anything about Boozer dying? I legit was sad af when that happened. Boozman was such a good guy ugh ! He never even got to see Sarah again 💔
I love being able to wake up smoke some weed and watch your videos
There is still an Unkept promise about using the crossbow ...
Brad, you don't know how happy i was when you said ´´Somebody told me the chicago chopper is the best gun in the game´´ and i thought, jeez that guy is me, i was screaming man.
been here since ep 1, sad to hear you completed the game.

How convenient
Brad I love the effort and time u put in ur awesome ❤️
The hit and run was a reacher.
You posted this video exactly at 11:00 pm
Only 2 more parts :( loved this series so much
Oh wow, that is so cool, I had all three camps at level 3 at this point, so Copeland and Hot Springs (Alkai) joined for this final fight, so it affected this cutscene and the final one probably too...
Ready for the final part Brad, love the series tho :)
I almost about to cry when Bozzer came out and I think I spelled his name right correct me if I'm wrong
This wonderful game thank you brad
Thanks for the videos man, love it 😍😂
When half way into the video Deek echos Brad saying, "Alright guys, let do this!!" Get hyped!!!
Man, you got off easy on that instadeath reacher fight and horde saw mill fight. I know by experience.
[spoiler] if u had maxed the other camps' trust, at this point 11:25 they wouldve shown up to join you [/spoiler]
Lol you go inside the nero building its snowing and covered in snow you come out no sign of snow
This has been one of my favorite series to watch you've done. No doubt you're the best YouTube gamer out there. Keep up the great work and I'll keep watching. Have a great day and I can't wait to see the finish of the game.
Brad throw a grenade bro. Make sure it's at a sweet spot.
When YouTube is full of drama but all I care about is watching Brad's videos 👍
I'm loving the back to back vids
Otifications squad where you at?!
I should be sleeping.... but brad is Supreme overlord
Love the vids brad 🙌🏼 Keep em commmiinnnn
Is this your main job?
Okay...this cliff hanger suucked...should just went for the big ending
Love the bite sized episodes. 
Keep going Bro.
Love you Brad, I just love watching your videos, they never get old😁❤️
How will this end tune in later for the final part of days gone


How convenient
Did anyone else realize that when he went into the NERO MMU it was snowing then like 10 seconds later it was like spring? 🤣
Thank you so much for putting dedication to this series! So much love from the philippines!
Boozer wanted to live, not just survive. Good story writing
Literally everyone: Brad needs more Stamina jeez
Brad: NEED MORE HEALTH!!!
Man I was sitting there one day and I’m like I’m not gonna watch anything and get the game myself and go in blind but as you see I’m here part 74 watched every single minute of every part
New DAYS GONE video? say no more RadBrad say no more
Brad complains about having no stamina 
*keeps upgrading health not stamina 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
the theme for the final mission in mw3 wouldve been perfectfor this
You are the real gamer man keep it up love you very much from India
this game is soo long , BUT I LOVE ITTTT
You now if had down all camps to level 3 there would be more ppl to fight with you meaning Copeland and tucker camps aswell
Best Youtuber Game Reviewer EVER!!
Absolutely in love with this days gone series! I can’t afford the game but I’m so happy I get to enjoy it through you!
oh brother that was so cool. best series ever with the best youtuber. how convenient!!!
Refresh and you shall receive! Thanks Brad!
lets go brad one more part till the final i can't wait man you the best
Love the series brad keep it up!!
Thank you Brad for giving us quality content 👌🏽
You did a great mistake Brad. You should have maxed out the trust level for all the camps. Again that special weapon of yours too sucks. You could have gone for 50 caliber.
I love this game. I don't know if I'm gonna try and also play it, because I'm already satisfied with Brad's videos. hahahaha
I’m on Part 51 right now.. been watching a few parts almost every night when I can. Really entertaining. The game is dope.
YES THERE BACK!!!! THE LAST MONGLES ALIVE!!
Btw if no one noticed that's the guy who did starkiller
STOP REPEATING YOURSELF  we get it you like the game...
I want these to come out faster😂. I wait so long for these.
just wanted to let you know ive been a big fan for a long time and its been amazing seeing the channel grow, the current "Days Gone" series is super fire love the game myself, in fact have watched you play more than i have played myself. love the vids keep it up man
Going straight to the ending. Not waiting any time. Let's Get it!!!!!
Gta5: I made a 74 part series!

Days gone: Hold my booze....
No homo but i luv u brad and enjoy the content
I just got the game it’s so much fun your the best keep up the gd word
Is this game really so big??part 74!!
That thing was standing there at 7:39 threw 7:41 and you just power slide right up next to it.
Brad, Days Gone; top sold video game on EU PSN, second most on US PSN, top spot for two weeks in Japan, top spot for three weeks in UK...
Can't wait for Brad to use shotguns.
When u are refreshing your YT page for a whole 10-20 mins for his video then u know that Ur dedicated!!
This school bully almost broke 2 of my fingers but this video got me in a better mood
Hilarious part about the CC is it is a .45. The Aug is a 5.56mm, which is much more powerful.
Way to leave it on a cliffhanger.... DAMN! Excellent game!!!!
HIT AND RUN LMAO
I might have to stay up till midnight to watch the last episode. But Brad u are my main streamer and you are the best
Bro i have been watching your walkthroughs since the Last of Us  and i have been watching ALL OF  your vids for the past 5 years . U ARE AN INSPIRATION BRO . !!!!!!😅😅😅😅😅😅
This game is awesome man. But sadly it will end soon :')
Keep up the work man love this game
There is a different version when you and the other two camps join in the fight
Not ready for this series to end but I'm really excited for Plague and Rage! I'll always stay with your channel for playthroughs
You're the best YouTuber ever Brad
Love all your video Brad! Keep it comin
Think you should emphasize stamina over health. Can’t hurt you if you can run
I am really committed watching the whole series. The game is amazing love watching you play this game. Hope you may post the last parts. It's 9/10 game.
There are different endings I've heard you'll have to redo certain things before ending the game again @TheRadBrad 😊
Man..  I want to seeing skizzo dead,  damn skizzo
Brad more people show up and help if you got the trust level to 3 btw lol
no rad we on the war why stop the video due
"I'm not even aiming with this thing anymore." Bruh you dont aim at all lmao
Man you should had max out trust for tucker and cope they would also had join u and you will get different end.
Keep spamming it Brad :D . Just love this series .
Ik i'm late. I was in school but can i get a big 'R.I.P' in my replies?
If you get enough truth level on other camps, you will see them come and help ya. There is a nice cut scene for it
As soon as we got to that army area I wanted to take it out. I was hoping we would. Thank you bradddddd.
Longest series (part 74 btw)
These videos come out every several hours because brad spends so much time on the description lol thank you brad
The police has been called due to a recent report of the abuse of the refresh button.






Ah Sh*t here we go again
Brad: "This is my favorite game of the year!"
Also Brad: "This might be my favorite game of the year!"
Bruh YOU LEAVE US ON A CLIF HANGER
Man, i love the game you put into and helping us out people to get the gameplay experience
Brad, u end the video with THE BIGGEST CLIFFHANGER EVER
U have missed out the best ending now
here since Silent Hill Downpour anytime I need a walkthrough I come to your channel
Man U keep making these videos n I’ll keep giving u likes
When I don`t know who is game in trending I go to you channel! I watched you whed you played Destiny Taken King! You are so coal in this game. I am from Serbia and I and my friends watching every day. You are the best.😀💪🕶
(Deacon) “Be careful driving this truck” (Boozer) “What, you think I’m gonna blow myself up..?” 😩 Hours later blows himself up.. I think 🤔
What? How can you stop the video THERE?!?!!
Enjoying these vids dude....keep on spamming...😎
Brad plz release 75 part also willing to see it
finally, I'm second viewer
If you got more Trust from the other 2 camps they would have aided you as well
How dare you with this cliffhanger 😤 final part now!  Lol
I tend to binge these episodes in groups of 10 or so and I’m so anxious to see the conclusion. 5 am gang
I feel like I’m watching seasons of a show, the story’s so good. I look forward to it every night lol.. plus your commentary and what not is entertaining and funny. Keep up the good work. Never heard of you or channel till this game series. I just looked up “Days Gone” to see some trailers of the game, saw your Part One, watched it, and have been hooked since lol. 💯
I was wondering when is he gonna post part 74 and boom here it drops
If you maxed the trust level on all camps they would’ve come to help as well
Wassup Brad. There's a few extra scenes and characters that show up during the pre raid scene if the northern camps are full trust and rescue Manny. Got a vid up myself you can peep if you want to see it. They also show up pre speech scene! Game was Dope.
Should have done this mission in one video...can't wait
Love you bro. You are awesome ! !
Mate have you been sleeping how do you get all of these vids out
Yessss!!! ❤️
I say thank you by supporting all your videos
That's kinda messed up cause u spend the WHOLE GAME trying to keep boozer alive and he just offs himself at the end😂
The voice acting is good you can tell deacon lost something when boozer  didn't jump
Screw Sarah I want Boozer back!
Hey Brad....if you can see this....believe me....You're the greatest Gameplay Youtuber I have ever seen ....my favs are the Amnesia.....Outlast 1 WistleBlower and 2 and Alien Isolation....we all love you Brad and let me tell you...that many of us hit the Like button just after starting the video...cause we know the video is gonna be hella-epic....love ya Brad....❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks man. Best game ever.
Keep that shit rolling love the vids
Was anyone else thinking of Halo when Dom died.
BOOZER!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭
A little bit diffrent with my game scene. If you maxed the honor on other camp, they will join your events. Mine have tucker group, but not cooper group. Too impatient to view the ending. 😀😀😀
the tease oml, love you brad
So excited about the ending of this game
in normal ending cope and tucker come to help
I like how Brad always sounds friendly and completely grateful both to his viewers and his sponcers and there are always just a few haters downvoting his videos and posting somewhat passive aggressive, petty comments.

You guys could learn something from his attitude. I'm new to the channel, but now I understand why he has the following he does. Gratitude.
19 comment keep up the good work
Wasn't worth the wait, but it's a pretty great game.
Hey brad, you may already know that there are multiple endings. And if you help more of the groups before the truck bomb they all show up to help you like Rickie’s group did. That might give you the good ending with boozer. Great channel, been watching your channel since 2012. Keep being you and God bless😎🇺🇸
In case you haven't heard "this game is his favorite of the year":D
Only 1 part left! This has been a fun journey
nobody gonna comment that after he upgraded his health it was snowy when he went in but when he left the snow was gone? just me, okay
A cant wait for the final part thank you brad for all the part
this is like the ending of rdr2 when john marston is fighting to the top of the hill
this part was sick thank you Brad.
Can you upload at the end of the year your best moments in 2019 like funny moment, your best series, and some other stuff y'know. That would be cool.
Cant wait to see ending, I just wanna say thank you for all your content
And please do more of 'A Plague Tale: Innocence' Love that game too
Boss fight was awsome. Thank again bro.
I don’t want this series to end.😭😭
U can shoot those speakers on the Nero checkpoints to turn them off btw
Why you don’t use Grenades or pipe bombs or Molotov’s against multiple enemies ? Whyyyyyyy? 🤣
Never Gonna Give You Up, Never Gonna Let You Down!! Lol been following since video 1, going strong here
If you helped out with the other camps more you would have had 2 more large groups of bikers from the other two camps ride in to help take down the militia.
It's quite sad. I actually liked the guy who was selling the guns the guy from the bike upgrades, they seemed like pretty cool dudes
Whatever. Finish it already. Days gone is just a failure.
If you had completed the other camps they would have helped too
What's up my guy! Just wanted to say I plan on watching all these videos once I finish the game myself... I just don't want to spoil anything for myself but I still like supporting your channel so I'll be back man! Awesome series man.
Says "Skyrim" and "40 50 hours" in the same sentence bro I have a thousand hours in Skyrim💯💯💯👑👑🤑🤑🔥🔥
god danm your upload schedule but I still love you
this one gave me the feels pray that boozeman isnt dead
The last of us 2 comes out this year
I just realized that the person that told brad what the best wepon had to go through a lot of zombies with all the game guns killing them and writing down what the best gun is  :]
also bradthe last of us is due this year and naughty dogs themselves have confirmed it, they started asking for help wrapping things up
Thank for flooding us brad... Please continue
If you had lvl 3 with all camps they come with you. It pretty sweet cutscene
im so motivated to get a ps4 and the game with this... tnx brad
Hey Brad have u seen the Real characters of the game
7:51 LMFAO!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
I agree 100% best game in a very long time!!!
can u finish the last mission on part 75 even if it is very long
Even though mine says I'm the first I'm sure there's a thousand more before me I'm just happy to be here
Alright here we go guys Radster’s real life supporters welcome to all new subscribers
I love the Plague Tale series plz do more in the future.
I like Deacon's attitude! He ain't gonna stop til you pluck em with the sig.
I absolutely hates Rikki's character in this game
BRAD STOP BEING A PUNK AND GO KILL SOME HORDES!!! ITS THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE GAME.
Boozer and deek are friendship goals.
There was actually a way to get all three camps to join you in the fight
Bro, I literally stayed up just waiting for this update. I haven’t even been to sleep yet. 😂
Omfg u cut it at the best parts !!!!!😭
I never got a notification😰anyways can’t wait for some more content from any game cause I watch every video
Deacon + Sarah = Happiness 
Brad + upload new part = More happiness than one could ever ask for!
Was wanting all the camps to join in
Please! Do the second part of a plague tale :Innocence
I’ve been watching brads vids since almost the start, stumbled across them as a walk through once when I got stuck... now I rarely game but the way he does them I find really engaging and for me it’s more like watching a long film.. in some cases very long... but he draws me in and then I just can’t step away.
Brad. U have to play this until u get tired of it. We love it. Road to 100%
When you complete all the side missions u get 1 0f 4 secret endings

Like complete all the o Brian stuff to get his ending ngl his eniding is mad cool
thank you brad😭😭😭
uploaded 12 seconds ago LOL
on part number 73 my 7 year old watched it with me and when the video was over she made me like the video lol i think she enjoyed it too. keep up the good work brad.
Stopped watching at episode 24 &’ bought a ps4 yesterday cuz of you
7:41 haha that zombie was there just to troll u XD
Loving this series Brad, let’s get this!
Brad the mission was different in another game play i watched. the iron Mike wasn't the only one was helped deec. Copland and the others was helped too i think it was Because you didn't complet the jobs for the other's
Brad what you gonna do if this breaks gta record
Have you considered streaming this instead of making 70+ parts . Easier on your part plus donates ! Get with the wave
Honestly i wish the game would never end
There's a secret ending if you play past the ending. You have to play for quite a while, just doing side quests and stuff.
Hi brad I am from Afghanistan 🇦🇫
The critics were trippin on the reviews man.. The story is really well done, the game play looks great and really fun, the characters are super cool. Graphics are great. What’s not to like.... I love just watching it.. lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Realizing what I just said I take that back you should throw a party now
i think part 76-83 will be the ending what about you ??
when you finish this game please try playing green hell
(7:52) Then why did you STOP?😁 theRadBrad
Brad ... Fan from India . Love ur game play
really that kind of cliffhanger now that is unfair
Can't wait for the end








But not us
Wait I thought we can get other camps to join us too.
demm i cant wait so long for the other part.

Drop part 75 asap
This video was 1 of the most stress inducing ones especially how boozer did deek like that not going to lie kinda mad now
hey brad where a plague tale innocence part 2 waiting for it!
Damn it Boozer, why you had to die? :(
Brad are you gonna play days gone again on your own time to see if you miss something?
I cant wait..   anymore 😭😭
Love this part brad u the best. Let's finish strong spam us please
Ok now after watching this series I have come to the conclusion that “st John kinda looks like John marston! From red dead
Yooo , already part 74, easy Brad eeeeaaaassssyyyy !!!
Woah woah woah woah WOAH NOW that’s not supposed to happen the other camps were supposed to come into the cutscene and attack with you.
NO BOOZER!!!!!
Brad's dad jokes always makes my day
Watch the new video and have to wait the 12 hours for the next video.  Lol then repeat all day waiting 4 hours lol
If you have higher trust at the other camps they all come and you get a different ending.
Please upload the plague part 2...
Hey Brad lovs your videos plz replay
Chicago chopper the best it can hit snipers one bullet at a time
I'm not subscribed to him but his videos keep showing up in my subscriptions feed wtf
Been refreshing all day long
WE HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR THE FINALE REEEEE
yo brad you need to keep playing after you finish the game so you can get the secret ending
Aaaaargh.... just 1 video left. Thanks Brad for everything, you rocks!
go to 853 days and faint nero for secert ending
Clickbaited..okay brother
I love how theRadBrad always uses the secondary weapon and when he approaches a cutscene, Deacon always has his pistol out. There should've been various DUAL PISTOLS.
Just like gears of war.....rip boozer
You didn’t get the best ending, best ending gets all 3 camps to support Deek’s militia assault.
"Think I'm going to blow myself up?"
Please, this isn't how I want Boozer to go.
It’s funny he was almost like scared of zombies now he’s taking out hordes left and right
damnit brad the cliffhanger
Please do 100% of this game! Its just too good!
i watched all 73 parts in arrow and finally i'm here before the finally i really appreciate your hard work brad we love you ♥
oh damn 1 more part and its done
Heya brad if you had maxed all trust levels all the camps would have come together for the attack on the militia.
Thank you and love you brad
I think u guys should see o brian face ,seriously
keep it up brad!
hey brad if u finish all the mission in each camp they will help u fight the militia
I love this thank you so much
Did anyone else think of grease when brad said its electrifying.  Lol... grease lightning go grease lightning.....
oh boy finally made it here on time
i cannot believe you stopped the video there..
Brad plz for the other video I can't bear it anymore
For killing boozer this game is a 1 out of 10
In Far Cry New Fawn I upgraded the MS 15 to 2200 damage. So powerful. Shoots through a mask in a headset. Penetrates two bad guys standing in the bullet path.  
Really don't need anything else.
Really your going to post the last one tomorrow?! I can't wait that long
BRAD I  BEEN HERE  WHEN DEAD SPACE 1
I'm being blessed with all these videos
next please bro 🤛
When is next upload?
Ohhhh Shyyyyet!! Brad please release one more part just for today man!! Please!!





That cliff hanger 😅
           
                                               I love Brad!
please do the second part of the plague innocence
I love the fact that Boozer is using an ice cream scoop to shift gears while driving.
He never radioed rikki like he said
Also nitrous boost can waste gas
Love the series but please start another
goddamnit why didn't boozer jump :(
Deek is like John Wick he lost his wife,  he has one vehicle that he drives because his wife gave it to him etc.
The way brad gets smacked is so funny 3:59
I turned on post notifications just for these videos, also that plague game was quite good aswell
big love brad from moroco 😘😘
Dude, thanks again.
Awesome just 1 more part I will not sleep today I will wait for this part to come I am so excited ooohhhh
Where'd the snow go around the start of the video?
Why u just can’t cut the alarm off first brad😓
Awesome Radbrad✌️
It’s a big one 👀
Remember that joke Boozer made earlier? About not wanting to blow himself up?
Was refreshing the channel like hell
Waking up to 2 new videos yes please
imagine dead eye in the game, focus is similar but dead eye is better
Im not sure how brad thinks this game is better than red dead 2
I was not ready for that 😢
I $<"(>,% knew it!  
That sucks.
It's been a great experience along with Days Gone because of theRadBrad.
Thank you very much, Brad.
This game is good still wondering when will it end lol
Brad, I’d really wish you’d disable those NERO speakers, man. Those zombies wouldn’t give you such a hard time while you play.
Your ending was different
Love your videos 😎💖
Seeing that truck reminded me of dom's death from gears of war now boozeman ;-;
7:57 😂😂😂
The sawmill was in the trailer!
Series gonna end soon 😪
Rest in peace boozeman😭😭😭
Fav game for ps4
I believe if you had the other camps trust level 3 they would also appear in the cutscene
can’t wait for part 75!!
Hummm i think the ending is a little bit different from Shirrako played....
Reminds me of the final rdr2 mission
(7:42) insert sonic slap
IRON MIKE! IRON MIKE! IRON MIKE!!! WOOOOOOO
Oh yeah buddy part 74
I think I was right when I said the series would end on part 75 put then I could he wrong and hes gonna try and get those different endings
Love ur vids
I've caught up. Get on with it.
DONT STOP UPLOADING!!!
We are heading to the endgame
Its just sad that Boozer died:[
I don't like it but I want to tell you that your stealth skills are very poor and You always messed the game
You are the best ☺
nooo they cant do this, Boozeman :'(
Please do more parts
thank u brad :)))))))
Hey theRadBrad I love the content and can’t wait for more Episodes of the a plague tale👍
I want to play this game but i cant buy it so i watch radbrad :)
Brad I watch you videos for so almost a year now . Can I get a love please ?
Will you reply to this is there a part 2 for plague tale or not
Hit the like button if you want Brad to all the side missions, quests, Hordes and explore the entire map completely!


Thanks Brad for the entire Show!.
That's the biggest Cliffhanger I've ever seen
use the flashbang to blind the enemies.falshbang could stop the horde for a second ,that would give you some advantage to take them out using greenade or something
Tommy gun is better than that
7:43 My Name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest  Dead Freak!
Waiting for the next part brad..gd job......
RIP

Boozer
Cheezits Crust first Boozer drives in with the big truck and now they want to plant charges all around the camp I swear where's Michael Bay when ya need him also I don't want to believe that Boozer died he can't I know he jumped there is no way they killed his character someone has to take care of Jack 😫
Man I'm gonna miss this series
Brad are you playing mk online
Awesome video RadBrad 😁
I remember part one m8 great job
Boozer will be missed. He was a great guy. Only had one arm but he got a fake arm and God damn was he good at playing with that clutch
MORE MORE MORE!! WAHH
Still the rest of the series is private
If you get your trust level up with the other camps they can also help you fight the militia.
where is colelamd
Wazzzzzzzaaaapppp.been here since part 1 baby
Are you going to be playing left 4 dead 3??
Yeah radbrad for part 74
Boozeman was my fave character
I don’t want the series to finish 😖
You are the best
YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!
End the video?, right in the middle of the fun shooting
Christ I panic like crazy when a Horde come at me.....my usual reaction "SHIT! They're fast!" *Pause....Load saved game" lmao I hate being a wuss!
Brad: “It’s daytime now. How conVEEnient.”
Game: <immediately starts snowing> 😄
*
Deek: “I need ALL the ammos cause I’m going up against a horde and will probably die.”
Blair: “Hey Deek! Stop by more often!” 🤔

Damn Blair! Stop being so thirsty and read the room!
Early squad?
The cut scene of them leaving from lost lake, if you would've done the bounty missions for Copeland and the other camp they would've all met you and ride out with ya. Just saying, don't think it matters either way though. Was hoping you'd change your guns back before going into the "you can't do it alone" mission too. Looking forward to the last episode though. No spoilers.....
dudeeeeeee you need to upload the last part right nowwwwww!!!!!
That looks pretty Epic
Keep it brad
One more for tonight please
Thank you Brad, it hurt watching boozman die....
The suspense is killing me
Last episode for the story tonight please?
Wow,you will soon be with 11 000 000 subscribers,if this keeps up...and yeah i hope that Boozer is somehow alive.
Omg I need more !!!
You all rock , have a nice day !
Brad plz upload part 75
The end is near.
next one the conclusion.
Another episode keep the 4 hour streak going🔥🔥.Also brad did you make the last episode 1 hour or 20 minutes
Beginning of the video: Walks into the building in the middle of a snow storm. 30 seconds later walks out and it’s sunny and all the snow has melted. That’s cool. Fu global warming.
Don't leave us hanging.
WHERES THE LAST PART AHHH
Hey Brad did u notice when u entered the neuro station it was snowing and when u came out it was pure sunshine
Isnt the game over yet damn

You rock too
R.I.P Boozeman.
I just refreshed and Saw this pop up
KEEP IT UP BRAD. been here from part 1
Best game brad
19th!
final part 😔
see the up next saying ending like what how
It's a great story but game? No, it has performance issues and that's where the bulk of negativity comes from. My playthrough consisted of synchronisation issues with audio during cutscenes and that kills the immersion so I've been watching Brad's videos just so I can enjoy it properly. Hopefully Bend Studio will sort out the bugs, but by God it's infuriating to see on my console.
My body is ready
Damn. I was going through walkthroughs just to see how close I am to beating the game. Just destroyed the dam and thought I was at least 85% done with the game. Looks like I'm only around half way. This game is too damn long for what it is. It feels like I've been playing it forever.
DOOOOMMMMMMM NOOOOOOO
I was waiting for this to upload, and I don't ever regret it!  Man, it's go great to watch your videos, with what I think is a perfect balance of game and commentary!!  Thank you, Brad!
From part 1.... ✌️
I just wanted to let you know that you inspired me to make a YouTube channel thank you so much hopefully I can make it it like you ! Keep being awesome(:
Been enjoying watching this series
EYYYY
Brad i hope you see this!
i dont want this series to end
Part 75 76 77 78????? 🙄
Why the boozman 😔
22:32


He took every shot like a champ lol.
Just 1 morw
FINAL PART TONIGHT BRAD PLEASE I NEEEEED IT
brad doesn't reach the best ending as you didnt get hot spring and copeland for level 3 trust lol
I think this is one of the games that you don’t want the story to end
I like snow
Damn this is a long game it has more then 74 parts not even 
Red Dead Redemption 2 had this much parts
plague tale innocence please!
Not even snapchats
Is brad gonna premier
Boozer is one hell of a drifter
What if it was a horde full of the big zombies...
do a 1 hour long finale !!!!!!!
Not sure what im going to do when this series is over
I feel that AC/DC shoot to thrill should have been in this video
Yaa boozer lives
This game really is not that good...
Let's get it guys
UPLOAD IT PLEASE!!!
I’m finally up to date lol took me forever to get here
Try the ppsh Brad
still here cant wait to see ending
4:38 freaker fart
Boozer nooo
What a coincidence my last name is Boozer
I dont think im an open world zombie person cuz i like exploring without  a freaker disturbing me
Pls do another one soon
Hey the rad brad you use the same gun you should use other gun it going to the end so why not use new gun just rocking day gone it's going to be the end .
Almost done 😢
That reminds me of when Dom sacrificed himself in Gears of War.
Nooooooooo not like this
Last one please brad
Wyoming
This is soooo good, Im gonna feel kinda sad when it ends, so I´ll keep enjoying while I can, still looking forward to seeing you play a plague tale. keep up the amazing videos.

Awesome!!
Oh Crap should have posted 2 vids for the finish.
Zombie ran off lmao
I'm confused
Use flashbangs
Rip boozer
First
First
Loves your videos
Thank you
Amazing series
I think I worked all the other camps to trust level three and I had a different cutscene for the scene when Deacon says everyone follow rikki. I think mine was better but I do not want to spoil what happened. It also affected the last speech and the credits
More yet?
At school watching this
Part 75
A plague tale innocence please
I was really looking forward to this game when I first heard about it and then after watching the first previews of gameplay I wasn't too fussed. Then the shitty reviews came out and I decided I wouldn't bother with it. However.......After watching your playthrough it looks really good and I'll definitely get it when the price drops by about half.
thank you brad, we still here even you playing another games ;)
love it, like it
Brad I like you... Need finish please brad..
damn, that is one of the good game you won't forget.  another one is The Last of Us.
horde videos are the best
its good
Found his channel like in 2014 and then I got too busy in life and then now just seeing him here labeled as the "King of the Youtube Walkthrough"


Don't you ever stop Brad
Can you play more Plague Tale Please
If they killed god dam boozman I will actually cry over a game
Morrrrrrre pleaseeeee! Been watching since vid 1 and the only gamer I will watch on YouTube. As always, such excellence that my non gaming sister who gets instantly bored when I talk about games/gaming, started watching with me religiously every day/night and didn't want any 'spoilers'. All the way from London UK, thanks Brad.
RADBRAD
This is the longest video after gta 5 well done Brad and thank you for your videos
Hey brad did you know if you had level 100 trust with the other camps they would have joined you in the fight and would show up in the cutscene where they are getting ready to hit the militia
Hello brad
Cant you do like a double upload or something? Cant stand the waiting 😂 much love from belgium
Hope the next part drops soon
STOP LOOTING EVERY SINGLE BODY
R.I.P boozer

Nooooo!!!! Booseman nooo
No not boozer bro
First yes
Boozer is a RIPer now damm!t.
I CAN SAY IT NOW BOOZER LIVES
Bradley.
U have another YouTube channel
Had
Thank you
97TH
Thank you
This game is scary i would not play it even u gave me for free
Out of everybody else that coulda died it just had to be boozer
You got a different ending, Theres a cutscene where its all of those camps and they all rally up to converge onto Wizard Island (You get helped by Copeland and the other camp) - pretty sure Boozer survives if you get this if he didnt die already
BOOOOZMAN!?!?😭
i am wondering where are copelands army and tuckers army
Dude why are you so bad at this game why would loot them when you getting shot it but I don’t understand you have no sense of logic
Noooooooooooooo Boozeman
Aayyye nice I was the 7,920 view and that's good enough for me lol.  Keep those Vids coming brad we all appreciate them!!
Sleeping dogs
Boozman
I'm pretty sure you finished the game by now, but just for future reference. If there are permanent upgrades such as health stamina and focus, don't max out health. You can edit and still give good content if you die, but maxing health isn't necessarily the issue. It's a zombie semi-survival game. Run and get those OP slow time shots in. Health is great, but getting wrecked by a horde and surviving it is not peak gaming. I only say this because a bit of a lead (stamina) and a ton of focus with two automatic rifles would wreck a horde. You got this B-Rad, just have more confidence in yourself. And I know you played Dark Souls 2/Sekiro, everything hits hard, health isn't OP, getting hit either twice or thrice ends in death, which forces two things, a huge health bar or a responsive player who dodges and parries, investing into more critical skills, ie. Sprint time and slow-mo time.
 I love yah bud, but watching you struggle with stamina during a horde event hurts me. Go get 'em Deacon St. John !
10:43 anyone else cheesin at this part?
Get the smp9
Y make it 2 parts to this story it just ruins it
IT DIDN'T NOTIFY ME WTF
Boozer is alive still
Okay, boozer dying was trash.
Haha all the people crying at 12:15 FILLS ME WITH JOY!!!!!!
RESIDUE BOLTS...Hi Brad. I don't recall if you have but incase you haven't, what about using the Residue Bolts for the hoard? Crossbow bolts with residue are an interesting variety of bullets. The defeated enemy will become enraged and attack his allies. It is necessary to rely on these while securing areas with a large number of enemies. Hit one of them and let him "help" Deacon to clean up the area.😉
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZER NO!!! BRO?!
Awesome
75?
Hey
onder 100 gang
Im on part 2I just have one question does this guy ever grow a pair and kill a horde?😂😂  i swear everytime he sees one he shits himself and swears he'll be back later
I thought the whole 3 camps work together!!!! In the end as per shirrako's end part video..??!!!
U wont beleve what will happen at z end :]
70+ parts for around 150k views a video but you haven’t finished Witcher 3 which had over 2 million views on the first episode and far outweighs this game in content. Sometimes I don’t understand you Brad. Is it for the views or for the fans. You had so much support on witcher 3 but you cut it short and on this series with significantly less support you devote so many parts to it. Smh.
There so many parts because you do 1 mission a video lol.
So I haven’t had internet for about 6 days and I’m 30 parts behind lmao
You should of gotten all the camps at level 3 trust, then you'd have all the camps joining your final fight :)
Hi how are ya?
YEET
I don't believe any game reviews after a game just came out. These people rushed playing this game and never got really into it. This is a great game and i believe evey one here can agree to this.
No you rock Brad! You're the best!!! 🥰
piece of advice or some spoiler in this game if you finish the storyline in Copeland's camp and tucker's camp they will be helping you fight the militia and max their trust level
who thinks that the story line of red dead 2 compares to this? Im still in the middle of it but this has felt like a netflix series!
I’m not sure if I want to see the end already or if l want to keep watching. The hordes are the worst.
plz Post more days gone videos me and my wife love watching them
aahh rad it getting more thrilling every part plss finish it for us 
YOUR AWSOME!! BIG FAN
This video game is AWESOME!! Despite the reviews, and honestly...

The freaks aren't our enemies--the critics are!

Something Colonel Garrett would say lol.
I cannot wait either, It is wonderful and you are awesome for sharing.
Greetings from Brazil! I watch you since skyrim :D
That was such a dumb way to kill off Boozer, lit could've jumped a million times and the gate would've still blown up
Definitely goty here. I can’t believe the rating ign have this game.
Where's Jack?
Soooo, if you could like spam the last few videos for the story that would be great. Lol 😅😅
Nah that zombie @7:59 owes you his ear
Forgot what channel i used to watch Dead Space walkthroughts... well,  just found it! It's been too long, 2019 already... i miss 2012.
Didn't think that Boozer was a muslim. Wow
Last second part let's get this 😂 😇
Boooooozer
😃😃
Hey brad you missed up the to other camp to help you, the hotspring camp and copeland camp, because you didn't finish the trust mission on this camp
If you helped out more in Tucker’s camp and Cope’s camp, they would’ve shown up in cutscene where You and Boozer were getting ready to ride out with the lost lake camp for war. They would’ve helped you to take down the militia.
NVM 😂😂
WTF is this 23 minute bs
R.I.P. BOOZER... DA REAL OG
Spoilers boozer dead
Please post the last part tonight.
69th comment
Anyone else cry when bozzer did that
Just finished smoking a blunt n brad uploads part 74 
HOW CONVENIENT!
BOOZER NOOOOOOOOOO why kill boozer
You’re making us take wayy too long waiting for you , just upload and upload with no stop, I don’t ever get bored so pleasee ... no one else is doing something as interesting as you!
Nooo Boozeman
Not going to lie seems like your just leeching this game as much as possible
Even in days gone, the drum gun is the best
Wait it didn’t show Copeland’s army nor Tucker’s army joining the fight. Is it one of those other options?
I would love to buy the game, but get to scared of the Zombies, when I get scared I get goofier and make really dumb mistakes and always die. I enjoy watching you and others play. I am 65 and love video games. I play Call of Duty all the time. LOL
A year ago before days gone came out, I said hopefully Bend Studios will not make the horde ridiculously hard to complete. I have watched other people play it, and they said it's extremely difficult, Brad has also said that it is extremely hard, I understand that it should be a little difficult, but not to the degree that it is. For other reasons I'm not buying the game but, games like dying light, and days gone, make it so hard that it becomes un- fun. The Horde part makes the game not fun. So if you find yourself screaming at the TV take the game back and get your money back or take my advice and do not buy this game. Does anybody remember why you're playing games,?! For fun!!! Not for political reasons, and not to be so difficult that it stresses you out.! Come on people no matter what age you are, no matter what political party you belong to, we are all playing the game in our Leisure Time for fun! For fun!!!!!!! Honestly, when you're doing the same part over 442 times! Is that fun!!? Nothing should be that difficult in a video game I mean come on oh man! Even when you finish a game like dying light or days gone, it's really not replayable, and you don't want to play it again, unless it has New Game Plus. Think about it?! Is there a deeper reason why they're making it so difficult. Ponder that question deeply. And also a little side note people, there are 80, and yes I said 80 hordes! Conjugate that for a second. 80 freaking freaker hordes! I personally do not recommend this game. I understand he's a biker it looks cool you're on a motorcycle , but take that away, really pay attention to what they're saying in the story line , really pay attention to how difficult some parts are and ask yourself, do I want to pay hard-earned money for this!?! Grand Theft Auto 5 is a great game, nothing is really too difficult, and they insult every political party, they insult everyone and that is what makes a game fun to play and enjoy! No bias no favoritism No Agenda insult everyone and let's rock and roll let's play the game. That is truly what makes a game fun!
when you finish from days gone  came down to us .watch dogs 3. i beg you  who is with me like
Been waiting for the part 74, How convenient. Thank you brad.
I just finished the previous part and now you upload the new one HOW CONVENIENT!!! AND I LOVE YOU DUDE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING
World War Z
World War Z
World War Z
Roses are red

This is crazy dude I’ve been hatching you since 2013-2014
1 minute ago!? How convenient!? :D
PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! change the facial expression of ST. John
I just finished part 73 a few minutes ago..

HOW CONVENIENT
Just finished episode 73 and episode 74 just dropped 
How Convienient
Days gone without Brad liking my comments: 1052
I view and 34 likes God dang it YouTube stop drinking.
Two parts left! Really thank you guys for all the support you've been showing this series. Much love
Brad: "I don't think ill fight a hoard soon"
Title : "Sawmill Hoard"
Me: "Aww shit here we go again"
Brad has managed to switch my body clock from UK to US

HOW CONVENIENT
Literally just finished watching part 72

HOW CONVENIENT
Radbrad:i need ammo man
Police car beside him
Me:are you fockin blind
I did the sawmill horde long before i did the mission. It was super awkward just skipping right to Boozer in the truck xD
The best YouTuber on the planet. I have learned so much and spent many hours enjoying your videos. Thank you so much <3
Beginning of the video. "I dont think I be fighting a horde no time soon". Ends up fighting one lol
Nice just on time 
Refreshed and Refreshed
just one word, Thank you!
Actually those are two :P
I saw a video where he killed the Saw Mill horde easily in stealth by just using a attractor then explosives. It's actually very smart. 

I killed the train horde easily in the start of the game and they just spawned back.
i love the videos so much. im going to keep on watching until the end.
Sawmill horde took me 45 mins but m glad i cleared it.
Militia members are noticeably more difficult to kill because of their armor.
This honestly has been my favorite series yet, despite the several uploads a day I still can’t wait long enough for the next one so I go and watch your older videos so hopefully those older videos are still monetized. Keep up the amazing work man 🙏🏻
Hey brad u should get merch with only HOW CONVENIENT on it lol
Hey i'm watchin your games here from philippines :) keep up the good work . Make shout outs sometime
oh shiiit here we go again memes;;i love your channel keep it up brad
Sniper having 6X zoom with focus still misses the shot, that's our Brad.....
I just love the way you say "How Convenient " :)
Aww man, I was looking forward to seeing the full saw mill horde fight as its the biggest horde in the game
Brad: The zombie horde in Days Gone is most craziest thing i have ever see in a game.
World War Z: Am I a joke to you????
fully committed squad where you at
Other players use those radio things to stack the freaks then throw grenades and the likes, hope brad knows this strat, it’ll help him a lot.
Sometimes I think Brad just completely ignores his mini map. Still love the vids tho lol.
Been watching your channel for over 6 years honestly got to say you came along way keep up the good work and I want to see part two of that new series
Love your channel and this game keep up the good work🤘🏽@theradbrad
Love you brad , I’ve been watching you since halo 2 much love keep up the good work ❤️
My god man why didnt u use the environment jus not worth watching
my game starts kind of lagging after a couple hours of gameplay any suggestions 😃
1st. Brad uploads How Convenient. Love the series brad. Thank you. You're almost completed the story.
Me: Brad use a machine gun on the horde!
Brad: I don't know... 
Me: Do it!
Brad: Selects RPD
Me: Yes! Yes!!
THANKS SONY FOR THE HOOK UP
I'm addicted to this sentence.
Use the mines man, you literally collected them 2 min ago
Brad: i dont think ill be fighting any hordes soon

Also brad:SAWMILL HORDE
Brad you have C4 and you arent using it. it is frustrating :D
Got back from school to see this

Thank you for this radbrad keep it up!! Thanks btw for upgrading your bike just do it often maybe more when your trust increases
JeanDeek Picard: “We have engaged The Horde.”

Deek: “I don’t think I need a suppressor for this militia fight”
Nearby Horde: “Hold my beer.” 😮😄
When you see a big horde coming your way.....  RUN BRAD RUN!!!!!
Reason watching brad
1. I cant play the game
2. I can sleep while watching his video ( how convinient )
Man!! Thank you for this game play and Ur valuable time editing and creating such nice 😍 video game content
I am enjoying, and liking, and loving this series so much my friend, keep up the great work Brad!
Hey man!! just enjoying my birthday watching your vids bro thanks for uploading brad!
Gahhh!! You completely ignored all the traps the game developers gave to you.
This series makes my day better. Keep up with the good stuff Brad.
0:41 Brad: I dont want to fight a horde anytime soon.

Me: (sees title) are you sure about that
Just finished 72, Brad uploads. How convenient!? Keep up the good work Brad
My girl gets mad cause i dont text her until the video is finished keep up the good work
Oh boy this is the part I have been waiting for since the whole series finally Brad thank you thank you so much ❤️ keep it up

Hay Brad are you excited for gears 5
I was just watching your last video not too long ago and was waiting on the next. And u did 
HOW CONVENIENT
I'm pretty sure I am not getting my PhD anytime soon thanks to you, Brad 😂😂 ... Keep 'em comin
Hey man this walkthrough has become a part of my daily routine
Always make my day brad. But when are you continuing 'S Plauge's Tale', I'm really looking forward to it.
watched ever video since the 1st...love the videos, keep it up brad
0:38 " I don't think ill be fighting a horde anytime soon. " proceeds to title video Sawmill Horde. That's funny. 😁
yeah that's true your intro brad😂 i've to check again n again if i'm watching the same video or not😂
Haven't heard anything about your little one's in a while.
How's everything with the cutie's Chubbs & Bosco?
nice video as always Brad , keep it up (y)
Love your videos! Please do all the secret endings i can't waitt 😊
Long video games are the best.
Keep on bring move of this game.
When the next episode for a Plague Tale !????
Brad u should switch the 50. For a LMG
Im from Indonesia and we love the video brad, keep it going 😄😄
I legit spent the last two days watching this freaking spam lol 
I'll probably fall asleep during my exam ._____.
40 seconds in..... “don’t think I’ll be fighting a horde anytime soon” looks at video title.. 😂
You should have gotten the smp9 it's the only automatic sidearm
brad, i'm loving these series. i would never play a game like this because it's become tradition to watch you play walktroughs! you are my favourite youtuber, keep up the good work and can't wait for you to play the new star wars game!!
Just watched part 72 and see this video
How convenient
couple of weeks of videos leading up to the ending, cant wait !!!
I am watching since part 1 and every part I watched was fabulous
'I don't think I'm going to be fighting a horde anytime soon'
-Looks at title: That's an Oxymoron
You should've gotten focus. Plus, you know you can fast travel to get away from the horde and go to a camp to refill on ammo?
Upgrade your bike AGAIN and you will have more space of bag to carry more bullets
I wish you can use a flashbang, but   you already finished the game.  😐😐
Love you brad, keep up the great work!
Brad, Thank you for the effort on this series.
Brad if you want a 2x4 to craft a melee weapon check on the beds of wrecked trucks. They usually have 2x4s
He still playing this? Good I love his videos
How can someone survive that in real life?
How can someone survive a Horde of zombies?
How will your survive this if you were in this situation?
What will you do if you wake up in the morning beside a Horde of zombies like that?
gets shot 2 or 20 times
"This area was pretty chill"
Brad you are amazing. Keep them videos coming..
Man I thought that you will figure this out but a tip for you 
you can roll, when the zombie pause for moment to attack you
A 50 cal headship will always be enough.

The hest milee weapon in Dying Light in, in my opinion, a machete or one handed short sword. They are a little less lower in damage than the Karna. Buy have a higher "fire rate".
Loving this game! So many zombies. Haha
Nice another episode of days gone thanks theRadBrad! 😃😃


“And let’s get this”
BRAD USE THE BARN HOUSE ITS FULL OF TRAPS!!!!!!!!!
Blaire is the #1 side character: Change my mind
I always hear scooby do laugh when a horde is around,  listen carefully
I started watching this a bit late but I caught up and now I am losing it waiting for the end!!! Love you by the way. Been watching for years and I'm here for the same reason as some, I can't experience this myself so I'm happy to experience it with you. Thank you and keep it up as always
I fuckiing love you brother
redbrad pls send me ps plus 12 month US code..plz
All I got to say is as long as your posting videos for Days Gone I'll be watching, love this game! You do such a good job with all of your playthroughs. Thank you for giving us the option and chance to be able to watch gameplay that we can't afford or can't play in general.
The missions in part 71 & 72 are actually in the e3 trailer. Check your 2016 & 2017 e3 trailer Brad.
I still cant believe you have 73 video of this amazing game
Kept on refreshing on his channel just to get this vid
20:58 Huh... Can someone perhaps STILL not be over big Deek St. John?
Guys I can’t get into chemult collage in order to progress with the story
im still thinking boozers dog is dead if he really is I will be so pissed
first time I saw you doing 3-4 missions in a single video 😂😂😂
the machine pistol secondary is a beast man. try that
How did you escape that massive group of freakers aka zombies , the way you escape that was to godly lol
that uzi thing is more effective than the desert eagle brad, specially for fighting hordes
I spent two days binge watching the first 65 or so videos and the anticipation for each one after that really hit hard. That’s how you know you’ve got a series worth being proud of making. Keep up the great work.
U can use the proximity mine to destroy the wood piles u though u could cut with the knife 💯💯
Thanks for uploading videos. Feel refreshed
From Jamaica hi am loveing this game keep it up really really nice game
Sony's trolling! "The last of 'em!"! 😀
I like him calling the fast travel, teleport hahaha
thanks for the videos Brad and keep it going.
Days Gone without Brad liking my comments: 812
I've been waiting for this, pretty sure everybody remembers this from the gameplay reveal a while back.
Finally brad Started Giving Hearts!
There’s an automatic shotgun in the game you should try that I’ve been hearing about.
I’ve been watching brad since I was 11 years old I’m about to turn 20 still watching 😭
My days gone save doesn't have that mark enemy when I use the binocular but it has it on other saves any idea how to fix this?
I've watched theRadBrad since GTA5 but I never commented every each part like this.
I just going to get some popcorn and some drinks and relax because you know that Brad always Deliver
Fight more hordes lol they look fun asf😂👌
You are the best youtuber ever brad keep it up
I think he needs to talk to Manny in Copeland camp for his old engine. The one from shara
Man this is amazing i really love watching your videos you never talk over the caracters and when you do say something its always smart
just create all molotovs when you going for a Horde fight
Upgrade sattle bag for your bike u can hold mre ammo an get it from your bike bro good work thoe watching till the end an after
Why is it when i watch brad do the hordes it makes it look so much easier, this one took forever for me. I had to use all my equipment all my traps and all my smg ammo and nearly all my rpd ammo
How convenient! I wish I would have seen your first video of this series on time, to have the chance to be on the draw.  thanks for the great comments.
Fantastic series - loving every minute of it.
You can do donuts just hit circle and hold you left trigger aiming right
Put more videos 🤓 I am like super excited to what is look like the end 😀💖
Don't reload so much you run out of ammo so fast
please!continue The gameplay of the plague tale innocence
The video quality after 20 mins is sooooo bad, please make sure the video quality is good
Nobody :

Brad : HOW CONVENIENT
And we really thank you Radster’s 👊
I don't own any console, but watching the Rad Brad play makes me feel like I'm playing
I've been screaming to get a saddle bag for your bike for extra ammo since like part 40...he just now gets it with 2 parts left till end game.. 😑
Hey brad you should bring the sawmill horde to Iron Mike camp to see what they would do
Buy SMP9 GUN IT HELP YOU LOT
(S)he( be)li(ve)d 




SBEVE
Watching Brad’s videos > studying for finals
Hey Brad, next time you do the horde mission use a radio attractor and after zombies swarm on it, use naphlam. It'll take nearly a quarter of them.
The no. Of times desk talked about the napalm molotovs. And yet brad didn’t get any. How conveniently inconvenient
I’ve been enjoying every episode!!!
been watching since prototype 2!
Almost at the end can't wait wait to see how the game finishes this story. Your the Best Brad!!!!!
When are you uploading the second video of that game with the brother and sister?
This part for me was a pain 
I was low on ammo
5800 views in 13 minutes? Thats insane
The collector in me is upset that you don't pick all the ears from the horde up. Haha
21:58 look at the sun shinning onto the building as you jump down that what perfect timing .
This is so awesome. Be sad when you do finish the game
lets ge this guys😂❤️
Hey Brad, next time you do the horde mission use a radio attractor and after zombies swarm on it, use a naplam. It'll take nearly a quarter of them.
Intrudusing THE BRAND NEW TERMATOR
You playing on easy terminator? Just strolling through the bullets
You made your exhaust louder you must of slipped your thumb off a button and selected a louder exhaust.
im so sad 
its near the end
keep up champ
I’ve been avoiding spoilers so hard just so I can finish it with you
I'm so sad the game is almost over. It's been great!! 😩😩😩❤❤
Buy the secondary smg it will help you a lot.
Blair cant stop flirting with Deacon.
0:40 Haha lol I don't think I'll be fighting a horde anytime soon! Man you couldn't be more wrong
I can't believe it....
He took half of the biggest horde in the game in the last vid and now he only has to worry about the other half....
Brad in a horde there is no use of weapon that is high in damage and low fire rate get that smp9 side arm
This is more exciting than voting politics who are corrupt.
I cant believe I've watched 77 videos. It's like a mini series, only better.
this game has more parts than GTA 5..... that's crazy
fails to use grenades or explosives what a shame...
1:47
HE LOOKS LIKE THE TERMINATOR!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I - COULDN'T - STOP - LAUGHING!!!!!😂
remember a lot of parts ago when brad was laughing at the title of the mission called i tried to hit that once, and it said it in the mission exactly how brad was thinking it to be. we just all moved past that. ok brad
Threw his weapon on the floor again while buying ammo... hopefully he won't need back anymore :))
Made it in time your best Brad 💯😎
For a second I thought the quest name was "The Last of *Us*"
When it comes to series... Brad you're definitely the man. You always do a lot of the side stuff, but don't stray too far from the main story for too long and you always try to show us the cool easter eggs and all that kind of stuff... even when the series is over 70 parts :)
First seconds of this video "I dont think that I will be fighting any hordes soon." Title of the video SAWMILL HORDE
Thank god brad uploaded another part I’m addicted to this series
The Sawmill one was the one I was talking about....... between 72 and 73 video are probably your best videos ever because you constantly had to run run run from zombies you never had to run like that before & fight too I did hear you say in part 72 that you beat the game so yeah so your intro to your game got a little scrambled because this ain't the end yet ...you did good on those zombies. too bad it wasn't a full bar or you would have been through a whole video doing it  so what's next Rage 2
Just finished this mission lol it was a pain lol. I made the mistake of running from the horde when I first met them earlier in the story lol 😂
Am I the only one who tenses up when the zombies are chasing him?🤣🤣
brad u gotta finish this series quick, i’m begging😂
Please continue the vid even you finish playing the main mission please continue the game and still upload it, I love when you are playing it
Hey play other game right remember Saturday night please thanks vove the videos too favorite
You tech us new skills  in  the  game
is the engine already maxxed up?? feeling sad knowing that this will all going to end
Can you imagine what goes through the people's heads when some dangerous melee weapon is being swung at their faces at such speed?
Wow this game is so amazing is it on xbox 360
Is it weird that I bought the game and I haven’t touched it cuz I’d rather watch it from brad then play it 👀
I love your vids and I tell my friends to sub to
Rad you gotta craft as you go... Then the extra material will help ya along the way fam...
dang not even an hour posted and, lik 1 and half thousand likes. radbrad you deserve all the love you get
It says I'm 2 watching n the 23 to like 10th to communicate
I've never seen sooo many parts on this channel
You should do a one hour 'special' for the ending
😱 I start basic training tomorrow lol I hope we can finish the game by then 😂
Keep the videos coming Brad can't wait to see the endgame.
Brad certainly isn't using his ammo sparringly
Taking primary,  lost that gun u collect during u been betrayed,  but ur right of something creating Video only Horde,  I hope O Brian well be contacted again and let the game still go on like side mission 3 years before the game release?, there more....
taking on the horde at full health is harder but holy crap its so cool.
Finally put the knobby tires on!
"I've got nothing but time."
Brad calling rpk rpd we all love you brad
Bro why didn't you finish the game
I think the sawmill horde is the biggest horde
theRadbrad what if someone leave you in small island, can you survive without your console:)
Me:Woke up from a nap
@theradbrad: uploads part 73
Me: HOW CONVENIENT
Lol runnin' gunnin' sprayin' and prayin' lol that was nice.
PLZ do Dead Rising 2 again. It was awesome and funny when you played it in the past. I miss "GET IT OFF ME".
PLZ do Dead Rising 2 again. It was awesome and funny when you played it in the past. I miss "GET IT OFF ME".
When I stumbled onto the second militia a horde was already approaching it so I hid in the bushes and watched lol.
The RPD is my favorite gun on Black ops 2 in zombies. So I’m so happy they have it here in this game.... MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE 😍🔥🔥
Can’t wait for the ending. Heard it gets crazy 🔥🔥🔥
I love you man keep doing good
This is one long journey.... Gonna miss this when Brad is finally done with it.. Thumbs up to anyone who been watching this since the first episode... You are a true fan of Brad!!!
Happy mother's day Brad!  Stamina Brad!
If it ain't theRadBrad video I ain't watching it. Love your channel bro..
Man what an awesome game thanks brad!
Brad you the GOAT 🐐
Noti g gang luv yo vids
Bruhh I Love These Videos .. Keep It Up ..
Nice job. You can't make us wait till tomorrow.
Brad is the goat 💯♨️
My man taken down a horde by himself if there were a zombie apocalypse I’d come find you
Every time he says oh sh*t I think it’s deacon because it sounds exactly the same every time
I love these so much thank you, your awesome
I’m dying for u put all the vids out but I know that if you do imma be sad when it ends
Rad “how convinient” brad
why do you have the soundtrack so quiet? its one of the games best qualities in my opinion.
Daily dose of smack 💯
How do you make the freaker health bar appear? I've taken nearly 90% of the hordes and not once did I have a freaked meter.
Use Chicago chopper or Shotgun it is OP
Brad you gotta utilize distractions and traps more
Buy the combat shotgun from Tucker's camp
Hi brad I am from Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Refreshed and saw this and shed tears of joy
I thought that Sarah and Kouri had something going on
Much love brad!!
cant wait for that "ending" thumbail!
100% and then some let's get it
I’ve been obsessed with these videos ! So my boyfriend went out and ended up buying me the game as a surprise! Thanks for the awesome videos !!!
FINALLY!!
I just saw the ending. I cannot wait anympore
You forgot to buy the smg secondary please buy that it help with the horde :(
With these white pants they look like a horde of Capoeristas... 😂 😂 😂
Really good game  I like it this and plague tale innocence thumbs way up
It's cheaper to refill your saddlebags then to buy ammo flat out
I have been watching this so much that I'm starting to have dreams about it
a horde with 500 zomibe  and a big rpg
Use the saddlebags to refill your ammo
Damn dude you went into the shit. I just had them run up the hill to the hill. I ran back to the camp three times and then those eight runner wolf started to come out. I had a full bar which sucked, great job.
HOW CONVENIENCE!
How convenient you took out half the horde last episode. Now it isnt that bad.
next time when doing horde mission use crowdbreaker gun. trust me you'll be surprised
I finished the game
😢😴😴😴😴😴😴
21:50 the zombie that just goes flying😂
I love the series so far but you could maybe try getting to higher ground when you fight a hord
Come on Brad, you are the man
the tommy gun was alot more damage than what ur using
would of been nice to see the sawmill horde fought all in one go. Pretty disappointing.
U play this game with your character built like a tank on easy lmao,  beat it with 125 health it's much more fun that way and the fights are more intense. The way your playing is unbalanced and boring! not how the game is meant to be played. VERY BORING GAMEPLAY
One thousandth like. Keep up the amazing vids Brad!
U can shoot them logs bro and they roll im pretty sure
Best series of 2019
Go ahead drop the last 2 parts tonight. Let's get it lol
Hey Brad, did you check out Ghost Recon Breakpoint? You should definitely play it on your channel mate when it releases or before if you get an early copy.
Keep up the great work we love you
Keep them coming radbrad 🙌
Ya you do u be like dang I saw this one
love what you do brad!
Upload the next one in hour
plz someone send me ps plus 12 month US code
Only 500 views dam
Now this has to be the longest series Brad has ever done on this channel
I LOVE THE DAYS GONE SERIES
Woohoo, keep it up! Thank you for uploading
i have binged this whole game dude
Tells us that he doesn't think that he will be fighting a horde anytime soon but the thumbnail determines that was a lie lmao but seriously Brad that is the biggest horde in the entire game break some legs brother
Rikki is really hot for Deacon.
Way too many people call him Deek.  I feel like that should be reserved for Boozer and Sarah.
Imagine if that horde was full of breakers. Now that would be a Horde.
Rad. I have to tell you that you don't explore the environment well.  Many times you miss bullets, beer bottles and other stuffs. You need to get all these items and fight against horde. That will make the mission more easy. Don't just rush to complete the game.
part 73 two more to go till the end can't wait
We gotta work on your horde strategy 😫
Yea brad, i had the choice when i graduated high school. Either i buy a PlayStation 4... Or my fender Stratocaster. Lol of course i had to keep the Blues alive. But thanks to you i don't feel entirely like I'm missing out on these great games. Thank you for all that you do and keep days gone rolling. I'll be watching
So by part 73 you are by the horde? I have seen one while driving but not there they say the map is big but its not
you can break stock of log
Man love your clutch
i was really waiting to see how brad will beat the sawmill horde
Two parts left it was good while it lasted 👏🏾
Best option for a horde is shotgun.
Could you shoot the strapped down logs and they fall on the zombies?
Hell yeah.. 79th viwer
I want more videos of this game till u get 100% after u beat it it get interesting
Where I live I don't want to stay up all night watching days gone, but next evening I got three videos to watch
Just all the horde fighting parts alone are worth the price. Can try over and over in different ways, awesome!
To put this simply the RPD is an absolute trash weapon outside of hoards. Has no damage, no accuracy, and you cant silence it. The only upside to it is its massive magazine size
Brad, this series is awesome
HOW CONVENIENT 😂
I recommend you play “Zombi”
19:30
19:30
19:30
19:30
keep it up!
Brad man, you gotta show us how to go tactical on a horde. Like horde genocide.
This is officially the longest series ever
killing a horde of zombies just looks so satisfying
Is it worth getting? Like is the story good and after your done with the story is it still enjoyable to play?
Amazing videos brad
No joke just got off days gone after doing a side mission this is madness
Wonder what that light in the distance was?
I cant say anything more than wow
The supresser reduces the power of the bullet
24:02 LOL XD
Radbrad there a perk that get to see all the berries and the tree
Lame running aorund taking so many shots.. kids game.  EFT is a mans game.
Hello like 👍👍
Thanks bro👌
Thank god i grew up watching this man not fortnite
Keep it up brad
Fully amazing game😍
Yes ..... just finished the last one
Another wonderful part of days gone it was a point where I couldn't keep up lmfao and a week ago I was like Brad upload more😂
please spam those two parts at once please brad❤
i going to buy days gone because it look fun to play and i love games with story with it.
Bro plz plz plz upgrade ur bike regularly. Plz
That railway tunnel near the sawmill works like magic Brad. Just a few good bomb placements took out more than half the horde for me because it's confined and to go around the tunnel means a great distance for the horde so they all keep piling up in the tunnel making it easy for me to wipe out dozens of them with one molotov.
I love  All your videos
Theradbrad hello and God bless you and your family. Damn, you are a bad ass with the sniper rifle. My favorite weapon is the shotgun and magnum. Noisy but does the job.
Took you long enough to do the sawmill horde
74 out already
First 2k and 2k in 5min dam
Just got the notification
Dude seriously just quit gaming
RIP to the freaker that had the grenade thrown at his nuts
Been here since video 1
Brad incase you forgot, you could go back to your and boozer camp there is a lot of materials there and ammo
Finish the game today.
Keep em coming
Can u pls look around more
Why do always say the same thing first tye intro it's cool tho but it sometimes annoying so let's get this live the videos tho
cool bro👍😎👍😎👍😎
Man the explosions in this game weak asf or am I just not seeing something
Attractors can distract the hoards and make them easy targets
First :)
Hey bro I like your walkthroughs really . But just an advise when you are killing a hord you can use your surroundings to kill them . By the way thanks for playing for the people like me who can not afford them you know the drill .. well that being said .. guys
Dammit i wanted to be first
if you don't kill the entire horde before leaving the area, the horde's numbers will increase over time
Who else knows exactly when his upload times are😂
see what actually prepping can do
Hey brad keep up the good work
Brad the 🐐
Hey where the heck is A Plague tale: Innocence?
When will it be out for xbox
I will miss this game once it ends.
Funny that the big bottles are called "Growlers". In the UK that word is sometimes used as a slang word for a particular region of female anatomy. I'll say no more.
Right as I search for it. It is convenient, but I'm not going to say it.
That aim tho hehe
Yessssss
love your videos you are the best this is game of the year
Lol cool part 73
THE PLAGUE INNOCENCE PART 2
You should collect  all of them
love the vids
10 minutes
Use the smp9 as you sidearm
Good intros 😂
Here we go again 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Hopefully more Plague Tale soon 🙏
I look so forward to these videos 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Damn that’s quick
Those freaked are just too needy. They just need a hug Brad.
No I don’t won’t this game to end 😔 hope another  good game come out
That was awesome
Just beat the game it was great
what's the point of using the supressor, right?
Me, watching this, it’s honestly sooo good to watch. It’s like watching a really good movie. Man I love this series. Good series Brad.😁👍
welcom back
Please post the last two today 😂
Another video

How Convenient
Use an LMG against hordes

19th Comment.
Thanks brad
Love the videos brad
Lit Gameplay
Please you must use the tommy gun next part because it very useful pleasssssseeeeee
thanks brad!!!!!!
Hell yeah
This game good?
I still got to make that Freaker's song What i might do is just use the video game videos to make it with a little editing here and there and throwing some music and there I make should be pretty amazing
make a 1 hour finale!!!!!!!
Ok so let’s get this straight, Deek says we must attack the militia first because they want to kill everyone......Deek literally goes around killing everyone and anything he can! Makes total sense
Did you hear that there's a Easter egg linking days gone to the syphon filter games where this is a time where they didn't save the world
Another day another horde 👍
Brad I love you too baby
Ima guess it’s gonna stop at part 97
Best videos to watch
clever comment
You can use your traps
Awesome Gameplay
nice aiming
🙋
So the horde u fought earlier was only half dammm that's insane is a lucky u didn't bcuz I don't know how u were going to make it through
2 weeks 73
Please play the plague tale innocence. Days gone is starting to get boring now.
21:49 you can see a Freak fly outta nowhere
1:46
anybody see that Freaker 21:50
can i have this game after you beat it?
Hi My friend
Can I get a shout out it's my bday
I want to watch all after game horde videos
If Sarah dies I’m going to cry
Im not gonna lie ive watched every part of this series with you from start to here and these last few episodes feel so rushed compared to the rest of this awesome series.
How convenient 😃
It so many hords
Please more Plague Tale Brad
Brad should start giving shoutouts to funniest comments
Now waiting for part 74
You can stick c4 bombs to the packed logs and the logs will fall  on the zombies when it blows just a tip
Man this game is the total duplicate of last day on earth but without the storyline(off course)
See the game's gameplay for yourself!
They could hear the bullet ricochet off the helmet
Ayeee here early
You need to get a new sidearm.
How convinient
it gets better and better lets get it fam!!!
How do you make videos so fast
Please made the part 2 of the plague tale innocence
😁😋🤣
people lied on this game the horde does wandering around the sawmill dynamically, that's if you go to the saw mill first then get them out of the barn by chasing you, then go back later on and do  the mission so all of them will be outside  just like in the E3 trailer 2016
That nigguh rad brad
How long is this game
For the horde
Yee yee
First
Have you tried leading a horde to those at an outpost and watch go at it
Hi brad
Why don’t you go get the damn materials you need before you fight the damn horde?
Another Great Video!!!!!!!!
2 left
I love  this game
79th
...
Why is it a half bar horde already when brad goes to the sawmill?
Last video of the day!!(for me) Can't wait until tomorrow!!
More please.
Hi there
Hey Brad if you go around and find all the Hordes and keep taking them out you will get rewarded with a MG 55 and then take out a few more Hordes using that gun and u will get rewarded with a MG55 Magazine Upgrade. It's way better then that RPD gun you have now.
Whoever put a dislike already sucks big NuTS
I love puppies
A Plague Tale Innocence?

Gg
Fucken aye
Hellooooo
I can't wait for days gone 2!!!!!!
Awesome brad
I don't believe any game reviews after a game just came out. These people rushed playing this game and never got really into it. This is a great game and i believe evey one here can agree to this.
Wow
Really getting the hang of those hordes! The way you took them out was BOSS!! 🧟‍♂️💣
Hhiii
Yuhooo
So how many "Human bodies" have you looted? Because there is a Trophy for looting 500 human bodies
Funny Comment

How convenient 😂😂😂
Says that he is going to focus to the storyline and goes to the biggiest horde in the game
Im so excited for the ending. Who else?
Brad:"I don't wan't to run into a horde"
also brad: runs into a huge horde
Thanks SONY for the hookup


How can you forget that brad?


How?
SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!???
Using a 50Cal against a Horde!!
BRAD THAT'S THE BEST JOKE YOU'VE CRACKED SINCE YOU BEGAN PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!😂😂😂😂
NO OFFENSE THOUGH!!!
We love you Brad!!! Great Job, been here from the beginning
Episode 72? Dang he's gonna have all his days gone before he finishes this game
I’ve been binge watching this series it’s amazing keep it up Brad
Brad you should film you completing that nero story line that O'brayan twist is insane,I want to see your reaction
Do some horde missions brad after finishing the game. Will continue to support this! Thank youu❤️
I dont own a ps4, thank you for sharing this amazing experience with us brad ❤️
The reason the horde was so big was because it’s actually 2 hordes, if you find Two Dog first then chase him it starts a whole horde chasing mission with a health bar, it’s the same mission as they showed in the one gameplay trailer at the saw mill
Am I the only person who watches Brad's videos before deciding to buy a game?? lol
Brad: I’m not going near that hoard
Brad (30 sec later): walks right into hoard 😂
Brad I love you, I've been watching you since the Dead Rising 2 days. Maybe you remember me from your premier and also you should premier the last episode.
0:53 never attack a man filling up his bike at a gas station, those guys just casually waiting for brad to finish before they attack
actually in days gone u need to stick to side missions, in order to maxed out ur equipment. main missions are getting more harder if ur weapons are still lvl 2-3
Brad, looking for fuel: "How convenient, there's one by a horde."
*Brad drives through a town without scoping out the place and arrives at a gas pump
Deacon: "Nice"
Rival gang that just jumped Brad: "Sup"
Brad: *Pushes L2 as soon as he sees them
Just like watching the vids.
Watched for years now. 
Favourite channel for playthrough s
Great job getting the videos out! Here's hoping you actually improved your horde strategies lol


After watching video: Oh no....
I dont think they wnt to talk brad 😂 those horde jst freaking hungry
At this point in the game my bike was almost maxed out. I’m grinding my teeth seeing his bike
Am from Kenya 🇰🇪
I love ua videos Brad usually feel like am the one holding the controller playing this awesome games... Thanks bro for making my days NOT boring
Brad: Have I been here before, this place seems familiar?

Me: It was in the Demo ,Brad. 

Brad runs into horde with little ammo. 😂😂
He FINALLY got the storage upgrade for his bike, after 72 parts!
LOL RUN BRAD....Marine Corps readiness moto...Alway be prepared.
Wasted your time by doing nothing seriously dude....
By the way love your videos brad!
Like your game-play.
Funny that Brad keep on telling himself that you need stamina, ammo, fuel, and crafting materials, but run straight into missions first.
Wonder if Brad will ever figure out if lmga are good for horses
2nd fav Brad line: ok, time to go
NEVER CLICKED A VIDEO SO FAST!! Thank you Brad!
Me: don't turn on the power before take out all the speakers
Rad: *take out 3 speakers and turn on power
5 Speakers: HELP HELP!!!
Horde rushing to Rad
Came back from work > immediately watch new uploads

Anyone else thinking "Fallout" when you read the title "Two dog"? :P You know, the radio guy

Edit : The fallout guy is called "Three dog"
brad use your flashbangs on the zombies it works
Thanks for uploading all the videos Brad I can only watch this game cuz where I live the game is too expensive to buy. Enjoy all your game play
Damn 100k views every video?!? You doing great my guy
That horde legit had me worried myself just from watching! Nice bike rides too
Hi brad I’ve watched all your videos keep up the good work
Had to laugh! Been comments all through the game to upgrade bike and only realizes that you can put saddlebags on when only 3 parts left 😂😂. Then i might add forgets to store more ammo lmao!  😂. Really enjoying this game though good job Brad 👍
I love just free roaming in this game. The map is gorgeous
You are doing great I am watching u since 2016 keep making more and more videos .
Finally you upgraded the saddle bags...lol love watching you play this series.. keep it up man.
Sick game . Most underated game of 2019. In it until the end
Use the light machine gun please The sniper is getting a bit old ❤️😂🤷🏽‍♂️
I've been watching you for a while Brad, and I have to say this is one of the best series you've ever done... 👍
Yes yes 🙌😁😊 I want More parts uploaded
Not able to afford the game? I can't afford anything to play on 😂😂 been watching you since DayZ series man!
great job Brad! thanks again for this!
Noice....these hoards are ace 🤣
Two Dog made his debut when the first play through was introduced for days gone.
7 years on this channel and never have I received a like from RadBrad. Eitherway love your content, keep it coming 🍻
Lol Brad, first and for most brother thank you for what you do. I laugh every time I watch you play shooting games, because sometimes you will shoot twice and reload, and sometimes you will shoot the whole Mag and then reload. It cracks me up.
this is amazing - best series of 2019. love it
Love your channel and I love your game review but i must say that in this game you were rusty like not preparing b4 missions not picking up important supplies no love lost but it your reviews that I look at when I get in a jam. Come on bro you're elite not amateur.
I'm loving the days gone videos you're making. Since the first video of days gone you posted I kept watching your videos
Brad. Thank you for these Videos.. Totally in love with them <3
It's not convenient man.... Since u upload it and like i have to watch it .... Cause it's damn too good bro.. I like u that much😎
You did track two dog wrong you were supposed to come from the front not the back of the mill
Best YouTube gamer, keep up the great work. Fan from Australia since 2011
Joseph!World's best bounty collector

RADY BREADY ALWAYS READY to upload Fast!
Imagine cutting to 12:27 with zero context of how he got in that situation lol
Yessss! Looking forward to you slaying some more hordes Brad. Keep it up! :D
End of part 72, and brad FINALLY invests in saddlebags.
Geting the thrust lvl up for malisha you could have the best bike upgrades
This game has been awesome. I have been saving so I couldn’t buy the game, but you came through with the back to back vids. Thanks bro.
Saddlebags and looting to prep for a horde Brad is the way forward👍
I've been around since modern warfare 2. How many years has it been since then.?
It feel like ages ago. .im glad your voice changed thou😄
He should have prep his weapon into heavy auto weapon  before fighting the horde.
Don’t want to do horde missions now.....*walks into horde*😑😑... then “this is not a good idea, I shouldn’t have come here” 😩
Thats one of the hardest hords in the game brad

How convenient
well// always smash the like btn before even watching...!!LOL
Great work on this series i enjoyed every moment of it. 
please do "Rage 2" next. 
will there be a part 2 for A Plague Tale: Innocence?
thanks brad.
Please continue with the game. I'm hooked on watching this series, it's one of the best you've done. Keep kicking arse!
if you do hords remember to put the machine gun the big one its better than the 50 call
Finally caught up to the Series! Brad I watch this because I don't have a PS4 keep up the good work with these PS4 Exclusives!
Read your comments bro, I’ve literally been telling you to invest in saddle bags since your second video.
yo brad......i hope you play "Ghost Recon - Breakpoint"
Glad you completed it, Brad! Thanks for taking us on the journey!
You did mouthing for 16 minutes of this video. Great content
JUST SAT ON THE SOFA CHECKED NOTIFICATIONS! 

HOW CONVENIENT!
I love how brad is completely oblivious to the E3 demo portion of the game.
Thanks for all the videos, that's a lot of work you put into this game. Keep up the great videos. Always a pleasure to watch your game play and commentary.
Hey Brad, I am a new subscriber but I've been following this series since 2 minutes after the intro and I really liked that you spammed us. Keep up the good work
Was looking For A Plague Tale 

And Got this How Convenient
Why Brad would tackle hordes without an LMG..... The world may never know.
In support You brad thanks the video
Thanks for sticking through the game Brad. I would like to see you do the horde missions!😄
One of my favorite series on youtube. Keep up the good work Brad!!!
You need creosote for the bomb. Creosote is used in lumber. Railroad ties etc. Your gonna have to go back to that lumber yard
"I could have refilled the ammo on the pouch, I'll do that later on though" Famous last words.
Reason why I’ve been watching ever episode of days gone is because I work 60+ hours a week and I can set my phone aside while working and watch
I'm surprised how committed of Brad keeping up with this series. Keep it up brother 💪 <3
Nice, just finished part 71! How convenient! Awesome walkthrough, best let's player confirmed!
Hey BRAD, Next Time You Fight A Horde, Get to a higher ground.
CLIMB CONTAINERS AND VEHICLES TO GET A SAFER GROUND.

ALTHOUGH THE FREAKS CAN CLIMB THEM..... IT'LL TAKE THEM MORE TIME TO DO SO. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY BETTER WHILE UP THERE!!!
thank you brad!!! I kind of fell behind on videos because of school but I'm back! Love it!
Your hard work and enthusiasm is highly appreciated, keep it up.
Still watching, Brad. God, I love your videos. Part 72, still going strong, viewer and creator alike. How convenient. :D
Brad: talking about the game... *hits a fkn' tree*
          "and I'm gonna die... how convenient -.-" that killed me LMAO
Brad by the way I have been watching your videos from 2006 my boi 👊🏻🙏🏼
Yes yes yes another I love this series
Edit:brad can you heart this please 
😫🙏🙏💓
Let's take a poll, who do you think is an angrier protagonist: Deacon or Kratos
I was waiting for this! Thank you brad! ❤️
Oh man..  Make this part until 100+  😂😂😂😂 I'll always watch you Brad!  Keep it up bro!
Keep grinding bro love your channel
You are the only playthrough YouTuber I watch 👌🏼
“I need everything... And I’m gonna die. How convenient.” -RadBrad 😂😂 20:03
Turned on YouTube and a new Radbrad Days Gone episode who needs Netflix 👍👍👍
Those driving skills my guy 😂😂 “and I’m gonna die.. how convenient” loved this series
So close to the end... LETS DO THIS!!!
"Hold on now, l-let's talk about this-"
It's been a wild ride and it's not finished yet! Glad I'm watching your play through my dude you're the real MVP!
That horde was crazy!! for being unprepared you handled it like a boss! ( ง °皿°)ง⁼³₌₃
Keep up the great work Brad , i'm here since the begining.
And good job love your content but I really liked your witcher series and I hope you you play it again

Love this series. This was my first time viewing your channel. Subbing now. Keep up the great work.
Hahaha man, you ran into the biggest hoard in game and changed the story of how you kill two dogs!! Hope you realised this after :D Awesome job Brad!
Perfect timing!!! Just finished part 71.... Love your vids
Brad I caught up with you. Better upload the whole thing quick!
For the horde wait till a lot of zombies surround the explosives, you always let the explosives explode right at the front xD Same with molotoves, etc just throw them in the middle of the pack
This section was the one shown in the first gameplay footage shown in 2016
Hey brad just want to say keep up this good work this game has been amazing and I love it thank you for doing stuff like this
FIRST
you should 100% complete it on stream
I’m eating a packet of crisps and sat in bed and your video appears on my phone 

How convenient
I normally never comment on video's, but I really need to appreciate how nice and fun this series is. Thanks you so much Brad
Lol I’v been bought this game but I watch you play it instead of playing it.😅

Love you Brad but give us the rest of the videos today I need to see the ending😂
This series is the best Brad love it man keep it up much love
Nice video Brad. I recommend you to use SMG chicago chopper as primary and any kind of MG as special when you go against the hordes.
Love the vids...love my comment back
That sawmill horde is the biggest horde in the game so good try Brad...Saddlebag ammo is way cheaper than buying individual ammo it's great
Brad I'm actually sad this game is about to end. You made it even more better. 
Btw it's my birthday today.
Yos first kinda im at 70 views since i last updated the site!
Bro I'm at work and all I'm doing is watching this😂😂🤣

Sad that I'm going camping for the next four days and can't watch the next ones made, but means I'll have plenty of these to keep me busy when I come back so all good 😂👍
My reason is that I play on x box not ps4

Ceda, Geo-Pharm, Umbrella, and now Nero.
Brad: I don't wanna do a horde mission now,  might eat up the whole video. 
Freakers: Did somebody say horde???
i have been here almost  from the beginning I choose  to play after seeing you play them to see how hard and if it is a good game thank you keep up great work
Well that was the biggest hord and the hord from the trailer that u were looking for in the first parts.
But really I enjoyed every part of this game ❤️💯
This game is amazing. I hope they make a sequel. Thanks Brad for the videos!
@theRadBrad, witch one of this games would you choose, days gone, rage 2 or division 2? I can only buy one but cant really decide witch one i should go for. 
Love your playtrough of days gone so far. 
🤘🏻🦖🤘🏻

U r fighting hordes and militia now u need to drop the sniper.. get ur machine gun or get that lmg from Tucker.. and drop this primary weapon too the previous one had a larger clip and caused more damage

Just opened YouTube and bam episode 72. 3 minutes in. Thanks Brad!
I literally can't stop watching this series, god this is addicting!

I hope Brad will keep playing Days Gone and uploading it more after ending.
Run Brad Run! (Zombie Hordes)
8 videos left... because the playlist of the game said so.
Fighting a horde with a pistol, respect man!
Brad you don"t  read comments, I told you ten's of episodes ago that you could upgrade your storage on your bike, I'm sure you even can hold a jericane of gaz at level 3, I:m sad now that you've ignored me ;).
loves ya my man
Keep up the good work Brad lovering it
I just done watching part 71 and i keep tellin myself where is part 72 and now here it is i wait about like 1 hour i kept refreshin your video keep up the good work brad i always love you♥️
lol I came back to this part after having my character take a nap because night time the freaks/zombies are crazy, much easier in daylight but Im loving this game its so good!!
Notification squad!! Brad loved the series you made it so good it was like Game of Thrones to me, anticipation and waiting for next episodes were killin me sometimes. Thanks for making it so great, love you and keep up the good work! ❤️
one of the dumbest moved brad made hahahaha love you bro
Wait, I'm confused, did he just say he completed the game in his intro?? Didn't part 71 end with him in a mission? So how come in part 72 he said he completed the game?
Hi I watched every part of game I have ps4 but not this game yet days gone so  I keep watching it love it brooo
You need an Lmg and the Chicago chopper ASAP
Who are the 65 nolifes that disliked this amazing video
Bar none the best story driven zombie game! 
Amazing. 
Too bad that I don't have a PS4;
But I have Brad to play it for me.




How Convenient!
Gotta say since I cant afford a ps4 I really love watching you play these games
Why does it take so long for youtube to make the rest of these series viewable!!!!
Ps Brad you DA Man!
i very enjoy watch u played,thanks
I'm Just Gonna go head and like before i start Watching!
I’ve literally been waiting for this mission and he does it in an interesting way😂
Fantastic walkthrough Brad..;-D
Can you please complete everything. Thank you
Man every time I watch brad do a play through I am always in love with the story and his gameplay
greetings from mexico, this is an amazing gameplay youtube channel
10:58 you are totally unprepared for this. You even said you should have re uped on ammo and equipment. Hard to watch.
Against hordes the perk "one hit - 2 birds" could help. 1 bullet for 2 zombies?
Keep up the good work Brad 👍🏼😁
Yes new part been watching days gone from part 1
5:04 you are correct, saved me a lot of money, enjoying your videos to the core, Thanks a ton bro !!
ya you know there is the horde why still need to go? backup and plan properly man
18:11 So why did you check the clues and start the bounty mission??
i watch all your videos for 2-3 years and you are my favorite on and have a nice day and keep on making days gone videos
BRAD. Im back on track of the series. Keep the days gone going. And its funny every time you say its the end game and its not lol
it's 4.20am here brad. i promise i will sleep after this
Hahahaha he had no idea what he was getting into 😂😂😂 this is the largest horde i think
I hit play so fast my finger got burned. Kickass Brad!
Loved this game because of your vids brad!!
I like your stuff, can't play this game, and love watching you play it, because you actually care about playing it
Hey bradwhen fighting herd and you run outof ammo. Theirs traps u can set set up. Lilk when u see the 18wheelrs with wood. Cut the rope nd the logd with fall on them...
Man if those zombies were coming after me, I would be shutting my pants right now... 😨😨😨😨😨
Dude you are so bad at this game watching you in this series is so painful
that's the horde that is being shown in the trailer you should have known the background of the game sir so that you'll have some game sense and can make much more interesting gameplay
figures out in part 72 that he can get saddle bags when he could have had them in around part 20-30..... lmao oh brad....
Dont have a ps4 so I'm glad you shared this, i didnt think it was going to be any good from the trailers they had released. But i was wrong.
This has been the best game I've ever watched you play brad. Im sad that it's coming to an end. I read some people think the story was lack luster. Idk what game they were playing i think it's been phenomenal.
Pretty sure you have short term memory loss as you forget to check your inventory every episode.... 😂😂😂
Finish Days Gone today Brad. :-)
70 plus videos and still can't figure out basic stuff. Ran around a county at night shooting guns and got surprised a horde follower him
Just done watching part 71 and here is Part 72.... awesome
You still didn’t  have bike storage?
When your on part 72 and part 54 is still new
First like and view let’s go keep up the great work brad
21:14
              SHE IS BLINKING WITH ONE EYE
13:39


Brad, you let him B slap you lol ahhahahaaha.
I Have the game!! It is just fun to watch you play!!
If you had enough cents? LMFAO ITS CREDITS DUDE. I THINK IF YOU HAD ENOUGH SENSE YOU WOULDNT BE TERRIBLE AT MOST GAME'S.
Wait I’m confused u said u have finished the game no way it’s done???
till now only 7 haters...but i want to compete you in India.
Days gone for a reason. Consumes a lot of time
Just like Ur videos I own the game but love Ur commenty and game play :) plus U entain my kids :)
Try to go to Copeland's camp cuz mabe he has more bike upgrades.
We all want 100% on this, I could watch this series all day
How am I keeping up with these videos
Awesome vid again, well done brad. You are the best.
Hey love your videos play it after
"Maybe there all.......oh...my...god" 🤣🤣
This is scary lol i won't play this game even its free
When you do bounty hunters jobs you have to carry detonators in order to defeat the hordes you have to stock up on a lot of explosive especially detonators
Sometimes being master race sucks.  Watched H20 Delirious through like 30 hours of Red Dead I think I watched you through Detroit
Um just on part 48😢
A new video? HOW CONVENIENT! :)
I like the hordes but when you just go running into it like this its 90% running around its not entertaining but when you planned the one hord that was great
Part 72 and yet your bike is not fast it’s the same not cool men
Keep up great work living your vids
20:00 very convenient 🤦🏻‍♂️😂🍯
I love you dude and just wondering can you upload more a plague tale innocence
Saw mill horde is the biggest horde in game would recommend an LMG
I might check rage 2 when I'm done here xd nice job
I'm not excited for the end because watching from the beginning I have invested pretty much over 24hrs of watching time and I'm going to miss it but thanks for saying you'll continue on after the storyline ends, I'm 100% going to be here for that. It's been great fun even though I've had my nit picks at your unawareness at times, I can't imagine watching it on any other channel, thanks Brad :)
Can't believe how addicted I am to watching this series, love watching your gameplays Brad
Keep Going bro . Well Done
'Rikki' looks like she could be the sister of 'Tony Montana' :D
You did 72 videos 20 mins a video and you still not finished, like bro start streaming,  like as a viewer who supports your channel stop this nonsense!
Damn I need a PS4: days gone, uncharted, the last of us  😭 all Xbox has is Forza Horizon
Hit like if your already waiting for the next part
Should of just finished pumping the gas. Dudes were gonna let you finish
I enjoy watching games you play. I can't ever afford them until maybe a year or 2 later... Oh the joys of being an adult... I wish you could have finished kingdom hearts 3
Love this series brad lets go need 73 and up
The title should have been " Just a side mission nothing great".
Every "Brad vs. Horde" is like a zombie movie fight scene.
This is I swear the first time you used explosives properly I’m so proud <3 love u Brad your awesome :)
I like your commentary on the video it's funny and you go silent in a cutscene
2 minutes 62 comments and 233 likes GG!
Brad have you seen the new ghost recon trailer?
Btw 6:13 is the biggest horde in the game it is the sawmill one
Love the vids you make my day better
Keep this up! i want to see the end bro! <3
Hey brad, the syphon filter easter egg is the Unknown Nero Weapon
This is probably the first game series that I want to see to the end. Checking back periodically, patiently waiting for that next upload. Who else here can relate? Great job on the gameplay Brad! Keep up the good work. I am a PC guy so I need my PlayStation fixes and you are the best man for the job.
I can't help but be a tad amused when Brad got the saddlebag cause people have been telling him to get one since like 10 videos ago lol
Thanks for upgrading the bike
So it looks like he ain't gonna listen. Uploads every 4 hours, only 3 to 4 video's. And only less than 30 mins of video duration.
In all honesty after the whole story line is done, you should do the side stuff maybe off recording.
U waste too much ammo by reloading your weapon earlier like too much ammo is wasted
Another vid wats left 3 more sad day approching until last of us 2 or left for dead 3 pops up :)
howwwww sweet, ive been refreshing all day!
Is that flirtatious banter I hear?!
1 I love your videos 2 I got xbox😂
yoo i can’t get enough of this series 😩
How long is the series? 75 or 79 parts?
Gagagshszhgzusiwb :)
The reason you recognize the saw mill is because the bounty mission there for two dog is from the E3 gameplay trailer from 2016 when they announced the game
Wow that was awesome and unscripted episode. You handled that horde like a boss and I really mean that
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!! that gamestyle bruh is pisses me so much
This game reminds me of how bad my decision was to get a Xbox over a PS4!!
U need every upgrade brad to have an A1 bike or high grade bike
If only Brad can use chairs as ammo "watches the horde run wild"
I love this game and have been following it since the beginning but on the last two vids I didn’t get a notification :( Atleast I made sure to check!
Love how he accidentally runs into the biggest horde in the game.
So crazy how a 30hr game nearly beat rdr2 a 70hr game part wise
Your vids are awesome and this series is amazing, but this episode was kinda useless. You took out one horde and completed a bounty. Hoped you would have done another main story mission.

Fokus for mission story brand !!
Keep these episodes coming this is soo fun to watch 🤩❤
He said he finished we on part 72 , guess how many parts we gonna finish on
i live for these uploads
0:50 😂😂🤣
i think you should start the side missions and unlock the good guns so you can breeze tru the main mission and stuff. the later missions are more harder so always come prepared ...
Longest series I have ever watched on youtube.
Brad are you going to do a full walkthrough of A Plague Tale Innocence?
we want more ! we want more ! XD love you brad buddy
How about collecting stuff so u can fight the zombies
Why are you always so unprepared when playing lol
You should totally make videos completing everything
Yes!!! Love the days gone videos!
This looks familiar because this was the same horde fight that was originally in the preview, back in the day.
Finding Nero 
Finding Nemo
Thanks for those rad videos and keep up the support brad
Yes! Thanks for all the video!!
Like always enjoyed the entire series.... amazing Brad ...
Was Iron Mike related to Rikki?
Yey for new uploads we support you brad
By the way that's the biggest horde in the game and in order to see the hordes health bar you must select the horde on the map
Got myself a piece of cherry pie and how convenient another video ! Let’s go!
We need more awsome series brad much love
Thanks Brad.... This has been a great series and its very shocking to see how underrated this game is...... Love ya man😀😀😀
Hey Brad I love it if you play a game having nasty monster s in it
6:12 It's the mission from the E3 demo
Would love to see the 100% completion.
I just got done with 71 Thanks for this
Wait why did he say he completed game?
in the episode 47 from this game put on 16:46 and see the face which is on the rock
Casually walks into the biggest horde in the game! Hahaha
the hordes remind me of world war z so much
Brad I've been with you sense dead space 2
The other one had a health bar. Lol this game is fucking awesome for doing that... Just means its too big for a health bar. Hahahaha
That brad is the biggest horde in the game
The end is coming :'(

awsome gameplay brad and best game
Keep it Bro epic series
God dam. I love every second of this
Keep them coming brad 🤘
Did u know the sawmill has 2 diffrent hordes one massive one and one smaller one
Are you going to do more plague i think it's called
it’s the E3 demo horde, that’s why it’s so finials! ITS THE BIGGEST HORDE IN THE GAME
Lol i just finished last part and refreshed your page boom a new vid is there
Love the content keep it up plz
Longest series I’ve ever watched! I normally lose interest but this game has held it, thank you for playing to completion. Can’t wait for the finale!
I love you so much Brad
First yes😁😁
I miss the tommy gun we must retrieve it
Do the biggest hord in the game sawmill
Love this series keep it up bro
Start using the lmg more that sniper isn’t going to do anything when you run out of your primary ammo facing a horde
Keep it up❤
Dude you shud listen and grab a lmg
I have a gaming  laptop  but I don't know how to download  this game
Wow earlier then my ejaculation....
I love your channel keep it up
do you not wear a head set like how do you not hear the shit going on around you
yes yes more please
After the ending, I would like to see the hoard missions completed, maybe all of the nests destroyed, bike fully upgraded; and the NERO missions completed if it's not (I forgot if it was finished or not) because it seemed to explain how the zombies came about and them evolving.
amazing bro👍😎👍😎👍😎👍😎
That moment you realize Deacon St John is Starkiller from Star Wars and Doomsday in Smallville!!
What's better than having a dog? HAVING TWO DOGS! 😍😍😍🙈
Please take care of schisso 🔪🔫
its 4.45 a.m here gonna get some sleep peace
Why do people say first when they’re literally about 5 minutes late
Please do the side stuff after! I’d love to see everything!!
Noiceee....I can procrastinate now
Brad we need to see you focus fire an MG on a horde..
I just beat the game. This was a good game.
Where is part 75?
we need the rest of it today. I need to see the ending
The Sawmill Horde are 500 freaks, the hordes in the beginning area, Cascade (Copeland’s area) are 30 to 100 I think, but those are small and easy, Hot Springs (Tucker’s area) are 50 to 200... The game rewards you for being brave and doing those early, after 4 hordes you get the level 4 auto sidearm, SMP9, it’s great, the next one is the auto shotgun (level 5), although it has only 16 shots it’s very strong, you can take out Ragers and Breakers very easily, the best ones are the IDF Pup and the MG55 though which you get after 50% and 60%, so after 20 and 24 hordes... They make the endgame a lot easier!
The thing I learn being a fan of Brad's videos is that he might not be the smartest in game's tactic, but he always pulls through any situation and that makes his gameplay different and more interesting. Like, who would've gone to a horde fight with nothing? LoL Another great video, Brad
My name is jeff finaly the finaly
Would love to see more of this game after you finish it
I NEED MORE!!! ONLY WAY I CAN PLAY THIS GAME IS THROUGH  YOU!!!!
Biggest horde in the game...that's why there's no health bar, they dont want you to know just how big it really is
I cant play this game because I  have a xbox not a ps4
Keep playing plz. Still be eager to watch more episodes
Amazing series man cant wait to see you do all those hordes.
Second boom 💥
I believe you can the ropes on the log piles to have them role over the hordes.
Noooooooooo. Please dont tell us it will end Brad!😫 Say it isn't so...
I see racoon in the map
Who’s game made me want to watch you play the last of ud
It took me over an hour to defeat that horde, you need an LMG & many Molotov’s
7:10 let's talk about this...lol
This doesn’t really matter that much but I noticed that the area he was fighting that horde was the same location that showcased a horde fight in the 2016 E3 gameplay demo
more more more this game is making me buy ps4 :P
Keep it up Brad!
Brad your great keep putting them out hro
Keep it up Brad!
LET'S FKIN GO
Keep it up bro
Keep up the good work make more tales on the plague game
People who dislike Brad's videos really need to re-evaluate their lives
Use the Mines Rad! Use your $&@?!ing Mines!!
Stamina, stamina, stamina!!!!
Complete the game there are secret endings like for brad to see
I love you brad thx
You missed 71 brad.
part 72 what the hell, how much is this game
Post like 9 times today please!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
When did u complete it I've watched episode and not seen that part?? Anyone else??
when u see that horde;oh shit here we fo again
0:55 They just wanted to pop in and say hi.
Swear down I was actually gonna swap to PS4 just to get this game
Am i the only one upset that he triggered the whole mission in the wrong way?😂if you watch the early footage where they showcase this mission youre supposed to sneak in and chase two dog which triggers the horde and you chase him while the horde chases both of you and he ends up getting eaten by the horde and then you finish the horde. It also has some cut scenes if you do it right I believe.
I found your channel in 2013
That horde stuff was intense!
The E3 video of this horde is intense
dam i just finished part 71 and lookie here its part 72
Keep em coming as many as u can
Did you notice that guy hiding behind stone on right hand side? 0:43

Lmao you decide to take on one of the biggest hordes and you have absolutely no supplies. That's why we luv ya Brad lol
make more of A Plague Tale: Innocence
Do a plague tales innocence part 2
Pretty bummed out that you cant have the soundtrack, I always thought the game just didn’t have one, lol. But why would the videos get taken down? Are all the songs played in the game copyrighted?
You can also set some traps
Love wt u do... ✌🤘
Second 😂
Just finished the last part and he posts right when I’m finished with it. How convenient!
Hey does anybody remember the saw mill horde and the junk yard horde in the demo
Love the series
Yo Brad this is the one from the trailer !!! and its awesome that we really get to see the location !
Wish they'd let you buy molotovs.
Do all exploring and hords

Since I cant have a PS4 at the moment yes I want more to this game lol
More 100 percent

Pls pls keep doing vids after series is over with like the optional hored mission i dont plan on getting a ps4. So this is the only way i get to see it watchng you play dude your the best
When are you going to finish the witcher 3 wild hunt
Hahah on the bounty mission next to the first body there is a hole in the fence follow the clues and he gets torn apart by the horde then you just collect the knife without even contacting the horde I had it done in 5 mins hahaha love you man
Why does this video even have dislikes? or any of his videos? my assumption is people who can't buy this game, or PC gamers who are QQin' because it will never come to PC, awesome video as always brad.
Hey aren't you going also play the game the plague

You skipped the nitrous.
Did he say he finished it?
How convention!
I’ve been here since the beginning
U gotta blow up the or shoot the lock to release the wood
Yesssssss
Plz post more brad
I can tell that you were never in the military because you always have your light on and you never stock up on supplies
Deek: “How many Freaker ears can I trade for credits?”

Bounty Post: 😁 “I’m sure I can take whatever you got drifter.”

<Deek dumps ALL the freaker ears from the Iron Butte horde>

Bounty Post: 😱 “Christ on His Throne NO!!!”
Brad plz upload part 73 74

I'm sorry but i'm disappointed with this episode, u didnt do anything on the main story
make video for 1h. I am waiting to see the ending fast enough plz
Lol part 72
love you brad
I watch because I love walkthroughs. I discovered walkthroughs in 2013. Horror...then I discovered theRadBrad. I don't need a console.
Finally bought saddlebags lol
I dont get notification bro youtube sucks
You have to do the secret ending
Seriously could of got to this in 14 parts instead of 72 if you done 1 decent length video instead of 4/5 shitty 20min ones. 
Proof you’re just doing it for the money
Use the building!! you didnt even kills the horde, just wasted a whole video.
I wish our support could afford a webcam
0:15 ;)
100 %Please
The sawmill was in the trailer
does anyone else recognize this bit as the area/mission from the first gameplay trailer?
I was second
Where a plague tale innocence part 2?
Can i got a heart plzz
Love this game
that sawmill was what they used for the E3 trailer brad
Love the feed bruh
This was in the E3 gamplay too, I think he either set a remote bomb on the logs or he shot them to get away from the horde.
Happy Part 72!
And you should've not killed the horde first or kill two d og like that because it's a special misson
let's go dad
Can you get to the ending
Bring us more!!!
5:13 ;)
That area you were fighting a horde and killed Two Dog is from the demo. You can watch the demo and see everything you could do there
This was the part shown in the trailer.
Love your vids
Great Job!!!
Brad forgot this is the sawmill horde from the first trailer.
Yes more episodes
Can't believe it's coming to an end soon 💔
the worst since of direction goes to... BRAD
ALMOST THE FIRST
This is epic
Oh no! 😣 finale inbound
Get the saddle bags for your bike and park it close. Then you can run back to it and refill your ammo. Also I'll fill up the saddle bags at the merchant, then fill my guns from that, It's cheaper that way.
You need to get the secret ending
We want it all Brad!
The Hoard wants more...
brad is so rad fam!!!!
Get it brad
Love the videos
Man i hope boozer survives
DADDY
Well...I finally decided to buy a PS4 Pro even though I still have the first release version PS4 and oh my God the graphics on the pro are a night and day difference. I do not regret buying the pro one bit especially having a 4k HDR capable tv (Sony X900F 65").
After playing this game nonstop for 4 days now I can easily say this is one of my all time favorite games ever. This ranks up there with TLOU and RDR2. 
I do not understand the negative reviews I read before purchasing this game and watching these videos from @theradbrad made my mind up to go out and buy this game.
I traded in "Metro Exodus" after completing it to GameStop and got over $30.00 in trade in value for it which was very surprising.
So I got this amazing game brand new for under $30.00 which is very cool...I believe after tax I ended up paying like $24.00 for it. :)> I never planned on playing Metro Exodus again so this was an awesome decision.
TLOU2 is going to be epic once it is released. :)>
I also own an XBox One X but I really prefer the PS4 Pro as Sony's exclusives are far better. GOW4 is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen...far more beautiful on the Pro vs the regular PS4.

I really hope we get some added DLC story lines for "Days Gone" in the near future. This has got to be one of the most addictive games out right now.
Two dog more like a rip off of three dog in fallout 3
That sawmill was the one from one of the games trailers
Love your channel
Post moree
couldn't afford
Love your videos
Finally uses the saddle bags
3 episodes left
Just some criticism I guess but could you like cut out the horde stuff (not completely) it takes up half the video. But anyway been here since you where doing the walking dead game.
Play a plagues tale
Let's get it!
Do the hoard missions they look so fun.
Brad loving it....
Please continue
Nice video dude
-___
I don’t want it to end! I’m currently more excited for episodes of this than the new Game of Thrones episodes
Put another up, please.
I caught up
Infinity gone
man i like this game
play some more plague
Makes it a lot easier to use noise attractors. Can napalm and Molotov or whatever items you have the whole group. Easy way to kill a lot at one time
14:16 did that zombie get tired? The mf clearly stopped to catch wind. But i thought zombies didn't breathe or suffer from fatigue? I have so many questions 😂
I heard the saw mill was one of the worst hordes cant wait for that
Please keep making Morrrrrre!
Yes plz!
I couldn't wait.
Try to get 100% there is a cutscene once you’ve done it
We love u too
Bruh ditch ur .50
Noooooooo it’s almost over😔 been here sense the beginning as well.
Wouuuiiiiii yoooooo
0:51 Priceless
good shit brad
up the brad
At 17:37 ...... You missed a bunch of supplies on your right!
Great series
World end is the trailer of gameplay. Its very big hell horde
there is no health bar, because the horde never ends... When you go in, you want to go in quiet, without lights, noise, or anything.
Spam us man upload more videos common
First
Dude your videos are great to watch. The only things that I don't like is when you chicken out when you feel out numbered and you'd rather run away then actually try and get good at the game. Stuff like the gun fight in part 69 I think or stuff you did in Sekiro. Specially when the game clearly tells you. Fight! But you go... Nah I can't. Not in my personality to run from problems, so it pisses me off when you do it. That's instant skip for me.  This game you did amazing though. Congrats!
When is the next plague video
More of the plague please
GIVE US MORE
Whens the next plague tales episode?
💎
Hi
Wooooo
I'm sure it would take me months to finish this game. I'm one of those who check out every nook and cranny. I totally suck the game in. But once I finished it, I would just cruise around and enjoy to ride.
Second
More!
Moreee
Who dared do dislike our GOD Brad!!
This bounty mission is in the trailer and no brad it`s not a bad thing to go into a horde, that is if you actually would pick up materials instead of skipping 80-95%...... 
Also before doing the bounty mission you stated that you ended up too far away, and it was roughly 170m from the objective. Now does that make you a couch potato or what?
Thank you
This game is long asfffff
You are a man
RUN IN THE BARN HOUSE!!!!!!!!!
i hate ps4 and this game no more no more no more
Use the chicago chopper
Moar
1 st
i just finished the whole game too and i realy liked it but i was a lil let down in the end i mean after all that the end was to take out skizzo what about the zombies no cure for man kind no notthing horrible ending smh
What if you need to burn the orange ropes holding the big logs or shoot it.
Ayyy
You haven't beat the game where is the big battle on the Island with Boozer and your wife.
Sorry Brad, but i have to say this. For years of you playing, you still doesn't get the grasp of the game you're playing even if you have been through different stages. Like for instances, louring the horde outside of the "obstacle area" will get the other drifting, by-stander freaks to add with the horde. Not preparing enough to create molotov and or napalm, not buying the right gun to fight the horde, and lastly, not following the story line, well sometimes. Not boosting your stamina hence you once said you needed to boost it instead of health next time, but then you found a NERO site and an injector then boom, boosted the health. Hahahaha. Im just here watching because of your good but sometimes noob commentary. :)
I hope this series is like 80 episodes or even more.
Love your vids Brad!!
In the beginning of the video you said you finished the game I’m confused :/ did you finish or no
I wanna see the horde fights.
:)
Did he just took out half of the biggest horde in the game?
Hi
Third
Third
Loves your videos
That's  not one horde it's 2 and they r from 2016 trailer
Spoiler: There is 8 videos left in brad' s playlist of this game... There all privated but...
I want to see the new videos of the plague game you just uploaded why are the videos private??
Plz 100% this game i don't have enough money for a playstation and watching you playing this game made get really into this game. plzzzzzzz 100% it
How many parts left?
Play a plague tale Brad
I just like your stuff
I thought he was hiding in there haha he wasn't:-(
Brad doesn't know how to take hords.
I don't believe any game reviews after a game just came out. These people rushed playing this game and never got really into it. This is a great game and i believe evey one here can agree to this.
If you hit the pile of logs the logs will fall and kill the zombies
Yeah whatever. r
YAY
Use c4 bombs Brad ffs
very nice part 72
Those wood piles you could have put sticky bombs or whatever to blow them up and of course they slow them down
Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad!
Upload brad!!!!!!!
Just hated this video. When you got story line going on, why doing side missions. Worst video.
Yo
Please play Sunset Overdrive please
Brad,  please spam the shut out of this game till the end. I feel as though I am binge watching something on Netflix. I need to know how this story ends, no more suspense.
I have no idea why you always say I dont have supplies? you keep going from mission to mission then back never making up your mind and then you never have what you need.... Not trolling and I like the game and everything but jesus you repeat the same shit over and over and over again. Please take this as constructive criticism
So hard to watch this guy when it’s trash!
hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes hordes
But where is Three Dog?
I'm committed rad brad
The areas where 100's of the Horde start coming after you I can honestly say is truly the scariest experiences I have ever had to deal with in a video game. My adrenaline starts rushing my heart rate goes up...truly an awesome experience. :)>
Nice
1st
How many more?
Worst video till now u just wasted the whole video on a side mission sorry just my opinion.
23 minutes of nothing
use the attractor with hords then throw something
Another wasted video. No story mission... Just a waste of time...
Scrolling thru youtube
Notification : New days gone video 
Me : HOW CONVENIENT
Watching because I’m a pc gamer...  if it was on Pc I’d have bought it... but i won’t buy a console..
u coulden't kill the hord ....what a shame
You say you're not tired of playing the game, but you are because you've stopped doing the one thing that has got you this far... STOCKING UP ON MATERIALS! That's why that Hoard kicked your butt and sent you running for your life. Just saying...
this was a poiintless story video :/
I went for the nero center forgot to shoot all the speakers and the horde killed two dogs for me I died twice.
good to be back
Cool vid
Fwog
i saod ur play some of the most upcoming games like day  one 2 and this nut techinally isnt bl3 gonna be a big game coming for xbox pc playstation techinally theradbrad plz reply i wanna know
I cannot get enough of this series. Please spam. But I gotta say; you are such an idiot for never upgrading your stamina! You don’t need that much health man! You knew you’d have to do more running towards the end of the game! You’re killing me Smalls!
about to go to sleep but a video just dropped
How convinient :D
Great best gaming channel 💗 love keep doing Bro 🌈🌈🌈
The rad Brad is the beat gaming YouTuber ever
Whoever presses dislike on this series must be fun at parties.
Legend says if u comment early brad will like ur comment

Best game this year so far
Is it true that if you upgrade your bike to much it don't work?
AYYY FIRST WASUP BRAD
I was refreshing and waiting for this to come out
"I need more stamina man"
"Constantly jacking up health point as soon as finding the Nero's Injector"
CAN'T...GET...ENOUGH, gonna be sad when this series is over.
Brad please use the LMG when tackling the horde... it's the best weapon you can use against them!

Like so he can see!
Brad: clears out an ambush camp like it's nothing

Me: dies while driving to iron Mike's camp
Oh i finally get my first like, i am so happy. But why is it blue?

Lost Lake rando background gossip girl... I missed YOU most of all! 😄
Is the voice actor for Deacon the same as Joe from Family Guy?
Wasn't this mission from the early gameplay footage/demo? This and the sawmill horde. Its funny that both those things are things you're coming across at the end of this playthrough.
Yo Brad, upload parts 72, 73, 74, and 75 today. Finish the game today.

Love how he passes 2 to 3 big gass tankers during the hord saying . i need something explosive
Brad: "I NEED some explosives"

run past a fuel truck marked with explosive signs

Brad: "I don't think there's any more explosives here..."
Do I have my silencer on I do not 🤣

Hi Brad i am your big fan 1 year before i saw your channel when you playing assassins creed unity
Hell yeah we are almost there! Love you Brad no homo
Use proximity charges for horde missions they are in ur inventory brad and also thank you for ur videos
Isn't this the scene from the trailer?
Nice vids by the way yo!
🆒
It be so badass if they made to were you can put a X4 accog scope of the 50BMG.
Great video man love your channel stay classy
The people who say they were refreshing are a bunch of liars lmao, first of all you're prob just another person like me watching random videos waiting until he post because you have NOTIFICATIONS on.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! KEEP IT UO BRAD! LOVE YA
Part 71 and there are 71 likes rn.
Brad your work is really appreciated, thanks for your commitment.
Man I love Ur video so much
And I'm destroying the like btn 💓💓
I wanted you to go the opposite way throigh that cargo door container all the zombies would have been trapped easy killz
"I dont really want it (LMG) but time is sniper so good"

and hows the Sniper rifle against the horde working for you Brad?
when your doing hordes brad use machine guns instead of the sniper because the sniper can kill max 20 zombies but machine gun can have like 300 ammo so thats like 150 zombies (if aiming for the head XD)
Creosate : X
Creosote : O
But it doesn't matter as long as Days Gone keeps going.
upload more videos pls brad!! I really enjoy watching you play so much 
and hope you back to upload 5 videos of DAYS GONE each day
So as far as I know, a horde of Deacon is more dangerous than a 5x horde of freaker
Two ads at the beginning of this video before it starts!?
Horde stuff and side missions of this 10/10 awesome game...love you ma...keep it up!
Each time Brad posts a video, my day brightens by 3000 percent
Man i stayed up all day just to watch your series 😂🤣🤣 love u brad
Uhhh love the videos man, you mean Creosote? Not creosate
Brad: I think I have everything that I need, not gonna worry about that.
Everything he need: 1 bullet and a prayer.
Was just about to go to a party
Sees new upload

Love your work Brad . 
Can not  wait for the ending .
Still loving this game. You're doing an awesome job.
Brad, it's creosote.  A tar-like derivative of coal used as a preservative for telephone poles.
Youtube is always late with my notifications.  I am here Brad.

Brad is the best gamer YouTuber don’t @ me💯
Well that answers my question on can those flammable liquid trucks be blown up. I had to wait a~40 parts to know, but it's nice anyway.
The story is wrapping up and it feels like the ending will be spectacular I'm so happy that I started watching  this series keep up the great work
I’ve watched since beginning. Thanks for this awesome series.
I love your videos I watch them everyday keep up the good work 👍🏻
“I hope he have ammo” 

(Looks at ammo box walks over it)
"Are they in the trees?"
Shoots
"Well that takes care of that"
Man the game has been awsome expected from brad much love and keep up with the great content 😁❤
Finally! brad got the Ear to the Ground skill.
Man love your series! Keep up with it!😎
Those hoards really get the blood, sweat, nerves, and anxiety pumping lol! I encountered a few much larger then this one haha be careful in the southern area of the map lmao
Keep going brad, with you all the way!

Awesome game and awesome Brad. Thanks we enjoyed this game so much 🌸💙
I am with you from the first part...I totally enjoy....keep up the good work
Checking my notifications and Brad uploads a video How Convenient
I have the feeling Dying Light 2 will also be very engaging. Am soooo looking forward to it. Played Dying Light for almost a year.

Edit: I'm pretty sure one 50 caliber round in the head would down a bear.
0:33 80 videos? More like 200 + DLC erhm.. Horde mode..
Dude, Playstation should be thanking you. 10m subscribers, you are a free advertisement for the game.
Are you going for the secret ending?
Brad why does this game have to end!!! This has been an amazing series. I love you! I have followed for so long now i always wait for your playthroughs for any game. Awesome man!
Planning is clearly not Brad's strongpoint.... frustrates the hell out of my strategist mind.
Huge fan,btw you can buy saddle bags for your bike to story ammo in, so you can keep extra.
Him: The good thing about this gun is it doesn't really matter if you-
misses a shot
ya gotta build that stamina up with these hordes...good luck
Always I'm within 1k views for all those 71 videos.
CREOSOTE, you got wrong spelling I think
Just realized this is the level from the E3 demo.
chicago chopper is not a shotgun .-. 
yes it's a great gun 
decent accuracy and very good amount of ammo but it's NOT a shotgun
Thanks brad your awesome please keep it going  love you man
That 50 Cal goes in 2 shot for the bear!!! Another Great Part Brad! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
This game like Death Stranding...I didn't understand Death Stranding
Someone needs to create a meme with deek smiling saying "How convenient".. Haha
If it eats a hoomans, it's a grizlord; stay away.
Noti squadddd!!
Legit passed over the same ammo box during the horde like 20times
"I can shift the hell out of some gears"...."And scoop a helluva lot of ice cream"
Yo kill Skizzo at the end HOORAY
Iron Mike shouldn't have protected Skizzo
Blast them away
Check all the police cars u will find ammo
Brad I love you bro but g you passed so many explosive trucks whyyyy
What du heck man this game is very long. Thanks for the content man really enjoying them gameplays 🔥

Nose down Manny! Good episode with epic hoard take-out, way to go Brad.
I am finally caught up. Whew Brad you can crank them out lol.
Hey Brad, man, you gotta put out longer videos. At least do 40 minute videos.

Me: How convenient
Heyy rad can I ask u one thing and that is ......... I wanna meet you get inspired by you...... just love Ur videos and love Ur commentary
It's only 2 big hordes and you fought one at the beginning of the video. My man Brad my man. 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️
Bro can u do more vids like 10 uploads on a single day. My exams are coming. I have watched ur vids long back when u played call of duty and nfs the run
I love this game Brad keep up the great vids bro
If you think about it, those "Thank You guys" moment in the beginning of the videos are like the opening theme of a TV shows, Brad's one.
71 parts in and somehow I still can't stop watching.  Great freaking game!
Brad - we the people are definitely NOT tired of this game brotha! Please continue to bless us with endless days gone uploads!
Love watching you play this game man! Just started watching your channel this year and it's awesome. I've always just had my xbox but watching you play this makes me wanna go out and get a PS4  just for this game!
Gotta, gotta, gotta, take advantage of the killing ground. Every time you left that ripped up area, you were doing it wrong.
Hey bro there's a secret ending once you get 100% in everything
Why is he so surprised about running out of stamina?
Can't wait to see the ending brad:-)
Love this series brother!!🤟

Brad the mission is a E3 demo. Two demos
Bring the tommy gun back brad!
Bro I’m excited because kouri and all of the camps will maybe unite and go against the militia
Happy Mother’s Day !!!
From a Mother to another ❗️♥️♥️♥️


Obviously talking to Mother’s in the comment section!
Isn’t this the mission in the reveal gameplay when they opened the gate and let the horde clear out all of the squatters?
I love the game, I really do, but I expected something different after watching the early footage when it came out. Seeing this reminds me of how excited I was about the game.
Keep the videos coming!! It practically the only thing I'm watching now on youtube!!!!!  So good!!😁
Use focus with hordes thats why I kept struggling too! You say you need explosives, use the barrels!
Lw when I beat this game it didn’t feel like a whole 70 parts but it was worth it this game is fkn amazing
When he said around 80 videos I was so happy
We are getting close to the end, guys! Thank you, Brad
Been here since gta 5.still watching everyday
@theRadBrad  it's not "CREOSATE" it's "CREOSOTE".

I appreciate you my dude.
Yes been waiting for this Brad, been watching you for ages now Brad and you never fail to make me smile and laugh, keep being yourself! Lots of love from Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 👍👍
Loved the series bro keep it up
You should have brought you machine gun with you and that might help
Hey Brad r u going to give a copy of game...:)
Radbrad You are stucked in this game!!!! Hahahaha... Still ending is so far
Brad tip : you can blow up logs you see with anything but they want you to use remote explosives
The smile on Boozer's face when he brags about being able to shift gears is everything!
Its always cringey watching brad play like what you doing or did you not see that item 😂
Man these suspenses between the videos are very long, my days are gone
Brad keep jacking his Heath like he super man he is buff
man brad ive been waiting since yesterday the best game ive ever played and ive ever seen
YOUTUBE PLEASE! JUST GIVE ME THE NOTIFICATIONS, PLEASE!
Damn It Brad all you had to do was blow that fuel tanker.
Best game this year by the best YouTuber
Don't know if Brad will read this but apparently, there are four secret endings to this game. Would Brad be exploring them all?
#40 on trending for gaming, how convenient.
8:20

Men .. days gone could reach part 100.
oh boy you know you're dedicated when you refresh at 12 pm
Im surprised that thwre are so many games that are honest with their trailers

Like Mortal Kombat, they had all the moves in the trailer added in the game
And day's gone, the missions and the horde in the sawmill
21:21 "I'm inside!" :D

21:23 "I was inside!!!!" :O
realy a grea game, i cant say it often enough ^^ im realy sorry for everyone that listens to the underrated reviews and doesnt give it a shot, they miss out one of the most awesome story driven games in years. thx alot for taking us along Brad
I love you man I like the way you edit the scenes at the end of the video, making us watch the next series ..
You nailed it ..
You killed it..
You're awesome brad
Tight corners not wide a wide open place loll
When the Next A Plague Tale Gameplay part 2
I waited years to watch that boss fight with the rager bear and all it took was less than five seconds and 3 shots lol
What I like about brad is that everytime he's so humble and in the start of the video he always says that he loves us and not a lot of big YouTube channels do that
I like how the mission they showed way back from one of the E3's is only being played now
Are you not gonna actually finish this game like you do the rest
Bro u gotta upgrade your stamina
Soon Brad is gonna be running in the 90s....in the number of videos that is
Thank you Brad you are the best
OMG I JUST FINISHED 70
Damn! Thx for the release
Hi can we get more videos on days gone?
Man this game is so good every episode is so amazing I hope there will be another game like this in the year.
Great Job on this game. I really am jacked to get it for myself. Deek is easily one of my favorite characters that I have ever seen.
Well how can we get bored??...you are so  passionate about this game...we all love your gaming...that is it...keep playin' and we will keep watching
Yo just to let you know you can shoot the barrels next to the log piles and they will roll onto and bury the freakers

Love u ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
BRAD!!!!
Part 71 cause of those short videos.
Creosote not Creosate, just sayin'!!!
The whole level is DESIGNED to guide the horde in long narrow passages between exploding cisterns and other trucks but our adorable idiot Brad shoots it from the side....

I love the game but I got several headaches facepalming myself at the way he fails to understand basic game mechanics.......
3min ago i got it fe

Glad to see Boozer can now live out his dream as an ice cream man.
Brad your officially my favorite youtuber.
Loving the vids, Brad
How many bullets it's gonna take to kill this bear, 3 head shots later with his OP sniper and it's dead lol.
Wasnt the Manny mision the one of the inside trailer
100 Gallons of Creosote reminds me of Monty Python and the meaning of life. :)
GUYS WAIT FOR BOOZER WHAT HE WILL DO FOR THE LAST MISSION HE IS AMAZING. CAUSE I DONT WANT TO SPOIL IT OFCOURSE.
MAN!! I WISH THIS GAME IS NEVER ENDING
Thanks brad for the series i really love it
That was the mission they showed at E3  with saving Manny and different ways to do it.
damn it!! i am an hour too late to get a heart :(
You mentioned Syphon Filter several times throughout the playthrough. I honestly thought No one else played Syphon Filter that game was the Shit no lie
Why do y'all all ways have to brag a about being first
Bro you missed mad shit in this game lol
The best theme song for deacon and sarah is Africa by toto
71 episodes... and still a long way till the end 😂
I am surprised radbrad didn't notice that the scene with the infected bear was early footage he received from e3
i remember this part first day of  the trailer of  days gone
You can blow the oil tank why don't you!!!!
1.8 likes and 8 dislikes, there are 8 devils who watch utube.
Upgrade your storage on your bike cause it gives you amo
You've heard it from the horses mouth 
Brad beats it
The game from what I heard counts a total of 40 hordes shit I only completed 1 so far but I am not that far yet so yeah
Shoot the GAS TRUCK!
It’s kinda been like watching a tv series...love the horde scenes!
I guess there is an automatic shotgun in the game which is great for the hoard mission I guess..
your commentary is good and all that but your mission approach sucks !
I need more days gone you done got me hooked
bought the game because of you brad thanks
Keep up the grind
wish this was on PC. awesome game.
Lol, that was me that said the Chicago chopper is the best, it is for taking out hordes, high damage and fire rate, along with a large magazine that you can make even bigger
You need to get those saddle bags to carry ammo and stuff.  Just saying.......
The auto shotgun  Brad is the best gun in the game
Oh shit, this was the teaser trailer i remember now
10 minutes! This is the earliest I’ve been since I was born!
HEY BRAD. I just wanna say thank you for all of your videos. Ive watched many of your series with others games. And i really enjoy every single of it. I also cant afford to play games because they cause so much. Tha k you brad for your videos!
Keep up the great work .🧙
brad sure loves his zombie games..
I want more of this game. I'm obsessed with it.
Guys what game should i get, I need help :)
Days Gone i get 40 dollars used
Red dead redemption 2 that i get for 30 dollars used
Why did Deek turn to joe from family guy after the horde?
this game is gonna take forever to finish
Damn Deek with the deep cut.  “Why wasn’t it like this before.”  🤯
I want you to keep playing until you decide when your done btw you can bring a horde to a enemy camp it’s awesome
This was a great part!
What I'll gonna do after ......i love this game ..and i enjoyed every vdo you played ...😘
please do rage 2 when it comes out
Hello Brad, I can't believe your on Part 71 (I Love it) keep it going, your awesome at playing game's & I never miss your Video's keep them coming, one of my favorite thing's about your Video's is when you say "How Convenient", I also Love your Intro's... "And Let's Do This"...Lol
Brad complainin bout the suppressor not attach
Brad doesnt care when he had the suppressor when un stealth
This is wonderful
i was about to leave youtube and this shows up... how convenient!!
Keep up the great work bro. Little Advice tho.. Those red boxes that look like red cross containers are actually explosives. They're everywhere.. Use them to your advantage especially with hordes
The longest episode in BradTV
Hey Brad I was watching you fight the hord, did you know the tanker trucks can blow up to. You run by them but don't shoot them, why?
Been waiting All day's for this.. Only game out before rage 2.. Hope to see you upload it maybe already monday 🙏👍

You're the best!
Loveing the 50 caliber yam bowy food
completed the story on this today.
3:28 that just gave me Vietnam flash backs
THANK YOU BRAD
Brad the big green trucks good lord..
Love this series man, would love to see you take down the hordes after the main story too
Is that a rocket launcher in your inventory???
need to start a petition to get this game on xbox
you are horrible at this game but love the content :3
23 min ago
After you finish the game i just want to see you beat the hordes and get all the stuff from missions
50 cal it doesn’t matter where you hit, if it doesn’t kill you you will wish it had. Something about a half inch in diameter and with that velocity is a beast, I got to fire them when I was in the military.
Im loving this series and you should rapid fire the rest of story asap im dying to see then end of it...
Brad is actually bad at killing hordes wasting diesel trucks kills like 4 only
Didn't they use the encampment where you rescue Manny in the E3 trailer a year or two ago?
Drop part 72 like asap plz
1st to one of these is quite a treat! will never happen again! keep it up Brad!
thank u brad :)
The rescue manny mission is the same one from the e3 demo a while back. Supposedly you could remove a gate behind the camp and attract a full horde to fight the squatters. Haven’t played it yet so don’t know if it’s there
Brad you miss a horde in the Manny mission
And here I thought I was going to meet my family for Mother's Day. Nope, must watch this video FIRST!
When is deek going to get his jacket back

I have to say I love your videos they are amazing but I do have some issues ways you complete you mission like the horde in this video, instead of using all your throwables at once and and space it out more, use your surroundings a lot more go through smaller spaces to create distance between you and the horde, use your proximity bombs on lumber stacks, mix it up to conserve your ammo and other utilities, other then that you're fantastic, keep up the great work!
I can't believe there are just 4 freaking parts left
Yes please multiple videos a day
3 mounts later. Part 231
Sekiro shadows die twice?
Couldn’t be happier thanks rad
try using the chicago chopper next time you want to destroy some horde
This is so good and so addictive. More please
We want multiple videos a day
So what happens if a zombie hits/bites you or whatever? do you just take damage or are you insta undead or somethin? (this is first i have seen of this game)
How long this goddamn game
This series has sped by so far.
brad the legend
Awesome vid bro!
Make an attractor and throw them at the oil tanks. Then Napalm molly the horde!

HORDE TIME
1 bullet AhAhAh
2 bullets AhAhAh
3! Bullets AhAhAh!
finish the game please
I missed the first bunch of videos but I’m glad I’m watching now.
if you are having a good, bad, boring, daily ...  day just watch Brad doing simultaneous head-shoot and blowing up freakers horde in days gone!
Keep them coming Brad!!!
After 12  hrs sir haha..  12 midnight here in the phillipines..
Now what am I going to binge watch?
Should be a DLC that allow u to build your own camp.... What you guys think?
Man, I've been saying it since the first time you faced a horde.
Time to change out that sniper for an LMG.
I subscribed you 5 years ago....
I aint gonna lie brad, but I finished watching the story on someone else's channel ...I know I know - it was childish and selfish but your videos come out every 4 hours and they are 20 minutes long...I know I'm a two timing son 'uva ya knw what... LOOK ...I didn't say I was perfect, but I had to find out... I know you would have done the same thing in my shoes so don't judge me...anyways I hope you understand. I'll come back for each episode after this one and smash like to pay tribute for something real that started over here.
U think that horde was tough wait till u get to the sawmill horde
The reviews are anti gaming reviews, its getting political one gamer was upset that Decon wasn't played by a transvestite or a by a black woman instead of a white male so on and so forth, you getting the picture now gaming is very political right now its coming to be election year.
Im early af finally
This is a long story game
Great job fam.
Brad please play the plaque something again pleaseeee!!!
And the wood piles can be shot
you are the best of the best. i was sure those hoards had you this time but you kicked ass. and you may not no this but you can ride a bike like i never seen before. those jumps and close calls make me want to see you play so much more. my friend if the game ends and you still play hit me up i want to see you in action so much its like a movie and you are the star.. brad i watched you years ago but i think ill be back fore good i love how you give two games away and how you always thank sony you are a super star and i love you right back. bobby god bless my friend. play fore ever.
cool bro
gg....
I want some more plague tale

RADBRAD
Leeets gooo
Hi there big fun of yours ... Finally writing on your wall... I don't know that if u can see my comment or not... U always inspired me to do things I have always dreamed of... Like to buy PS4 ... Each video of your is like inspection to me... Respect form bottom of my heart... Fan from India
ah yess, here we go again
First
Just finished part 70 now this

How Convenient!!!😂
your stupidity astounds me
Hi brother
Dang I been waiting all morning
Brad sold his soul years ago I miss the old brad time to unsub il miss your annoying voice
Lol he said don’t make a sound as he stepped on a can
Hope it don't end
Thank you
Thank you for the dedication brad! Love from the Philippines!
👍
Please play more Plague Tale
Ayeeee
Hey play the plague game
5 th
3:02 that freaker went flying hahahahaha
thank you
I would like to do the same
love you
I accidentally dislike this video, i feel so ashamed 😓
Yeah yeah yeah let's get it
Why does Brad shoot the damn gasoline trucks so damn early when he’s fighting a horde instead of waiting until they all gather near it. It’s so cringe
What up 😝
Don't want it to end!!!!
Finally
4am
Bear at 20:22
part 71
Finaly
Isn't this the part in the trailer where you use a swarm to defeat the enemies? But it doesn't happen in the actual game? In the actual game no swarm but you still get the bear
screw the negative reviews of this game. this game just sold more copies than God of War in Japan. And is selling more then expected globally and companies like IGN who gave it bad reviews are getting a bad rep for it so bad they had to post a video defending their negative review of the game.
:)
Comment before brad
Brad if u do the horde stuff after finish the story, and u have tank trucks standing around, try to lure them close to it but dont shoot it as soon as a few are next to it, wait till theres a bigger pack of min 10 plus, else just run another round, but that way u could have safed some of the bullets and time ^^ realy awesome to watch u chew tru them tho ntl, i love this series and its sad to know we are getting cloes to the end, i enjoyed every episode of it ^^
Hi
Love from india rad brad. I want to meet you and see u play such games n learn how to make videos. I wonder if u let fans meet n greet. Its a dream 😊
When Borderlands 3 comes out you should play it.
Lonely
finally
Yayayayyayayyayya
I don't believe any game reviews after a game just came out. These people rushed playing this game and never got really into it. This is a great game and i believe evey one here will agree to this.
awesome
5th
ayy
This isn't  a game. This is a career.
Boozer dies in the last mission
hhhhhhhh 20:09 🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
Awesome video
BRAD IF YOU 100%COMPLETE THE  GAME INCLUDING SIDE STUFF YOU WILL GET A SECRET ENDING WITH O BRIAN .NOT GONA SOPIL IT BUT ITS HELLA AMAZING
i wonder why the dear or what you call them is the key because they are  not in infected
This is what im waiting for!!!!!!
i really get annoyed watching him play, waist all the bombs and he was not using the area properly
So convenient
I’m so sad that it’s coming to an end. I Get more invested in this game than any TV show
e a r l y
If u know this mission of the bear one was in the trailer or the demo and they did it in a different way and u in another way 
So try to remember it
More

OOF
BIG BLACK BONERINO

God you're slow...
Skizzo is the worst
Hi 66 yea boi
Man then starting... Hahhahha...
Hiiiiiiiyaaaaaaaa , another awesome vid !
Shot the green truck
3rd boi
SPAM MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can’t wait another 3.5 hours
نایس 💪
Can you shoot gas tankers to make them explode on horde
Anyone else get out of breathe like deek just watching him run around and that’s a good use for a ice cream scoop in a apocalypse a fake hand
Just Keep It Going 👌💪👍
Brad you need to stop shooting explosives to early you could take out an entire hoard with 2 fuel trucks it’s timing you panic shoot
awesome! :)
Great vid broda
Seen all episodes, even skipped sleep. Thank you Brad! ❤️❤️
Brad can you upload  every 2 hours because I’m going crazy because I look to see if you have any vids but you won’t have the next video
Like you said they put ways to take out the hordes in the area
Keep uploading 4 videos daily we want more days gone brad!!!
I waited 11 hours for this, thanks brad! 😘
❤️💞❣️💖💘💓💘💖💖💗💗🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Been following you since 2013 Brad❤️❤️❤️❤️
First
finishing this video makes me feel empty, how much more if the series is over😭😭😭
Brad I really love this series im so hooked man haven't missed one episode👍
Skizzo is a real piece of crap. Smh.

Of all the camp bases you could've ended up on, he ends up at this one. Kouri has my respect. He's such a honorable guy. I hope Deek crosses paths with him again.
I've always respected Iron Mike. Always been a stand up guy with a good heart.
I am refreshing and refreshing
Part 69 was 3 hours and 58 minutes ago and i know the pattern lets go first
Thank you Brad! Can't believe there are only 5 freaking episodes left! Much love <333
Please spam this series and finish it.. I can’t handle the suspense 😂
I just finished part 69 and thought I would have to wait until tomorrow for the next part. 3 minutes later I see part 70. Thanks Brad!
Brad we need you to never stop playing this. We need 100%. Can u upload until 100% done????
Im suppose to be studying but Im watchin radbrad instead XD
I was refreshing from 3.58.. haha love you Brad. I love all your videos. I hope Plague series does well also.
Mike was a good man, and a good leader...RIP
This game's so good I'm about to go nuts to see what happens next!
I swear to god skizzo better die horribly!
Rest in peace Iron Mike.Skizzo you will suffer for this.
13:26
I like how it's the end of the game and the tip that the game decide was most important for Brad was, "your bike takes damage when you ram into things".
I just finished this game could not have done it without watching you videos 


Love your channel it’s helped me through lots in life
Once the ending picked up. The story was sooo good
Brad please use the LMG when tackling hordes... it's the best weapon you can use. Like so he can see!
brad talking about if you get sht by a 50 cal you'll die. also running into an area with well armed man getting shot several time we kill you, lol
IDF Pup is short for Israeli Defense Force Bull Pup Rifle which would be a Tavor X95.  Keep the great content coming.
Casually refreshing for the video lol, been bored. ❤
Looking forward to brad clearing up the horde lol
Maybe this time he'll blow himself up again 🤣🤣🤣
I have never seen such a good game! And brad you made it 100x more fun, keep it up! <3
I want to see Ghost Recon Break point game play.. do 😋🤔you play the game bro..
Im enjoying this series but ur so bad at this game xd, love you tho!
Love your videos brother.keep it up.much love from India.😍😍😍
I really want to see skizzo get hit up with that spiked bat lol
This game has increased to be fascinating and I love the way you play them without any unexpected cuts in the scene.

Hey Rad, Heres a tip. 

If you are gonna fight hordes (after the game) I suggest using a Machine gun preferably the RPD. 
That's all, If you see this, Thank you for reading.
0:57 Me yelling at my laptop "take the SMP9 machine pistol Brad"....and he didn't hear me :(
oh my god Brad, you didn't take the uzi secondary lol
Man i..the story is like getting high right now...i check your update almost every hour..i following this from the first part dude...keep up the amazing works!
Lol deacon is whispering to a yelling crowd.
My new favorite quote:
"I don't care who you are man, a 50. caliper is going to kill you"

Yayyyyy another video. # 70 to be precise.
Thise guys who set up that wire trap, I would have killed them all. So they cannot harm anyone else.

You're absolutely right Brad. A 50 caliber round will go through walls.
Brad I'm from Indian. and I always love to watch you video. I didn't missed. Bro love from heart❤
BRAD 4 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 🙌
as much as i love this series... I'm a little excited for the ending so you can chill a bit after grinding so hard on uploading lol Take it easy Brad we love ya
It’s getting to a point where I should just cancel my Netflix brad... 😂
Hey Brad you are my favorite YouTuber I've watched every video on this game and Days Gone is the best game that came out this year so far
DAYS GONE+UNCHARTED=The Nathan Apocalyse The Game
Yes. Brads the best at these games. Hes a legend
when you go to fight a horde try to replace the 50 cal sniper with a machine gun that s make it a lot easy
So now you are fighting the militia. Mixing God with Guns is never a good idea.
Capt. Kouri is a chill dude.👌
Your timing is perfect Brad... "how convenient" !!!
You gotta hurry up with more uploads, dude. ;)
Brad this series have been amazing I didn't miss a video till now I am waiting for new videos until this series finishes 🖒😃
Just chilling and watching my favorite youtuber
This so cool🤙🏽but wheres the dishonerd 2 playthorughs😂🤣
Literally picks up a remote explosive 1 minute before, hmmmm how do I need to blow this open uses granade 🤔🤔🤔 10iq
Boozer could use a Shinobi prosthetic or two tbh. Thanks Brad, I thought had to wait for tomos for 70.
Brad, i gotta say, this is quality content dude. been binge-watching this series from episode 1 since 2 days ago and i cant stop watching. keep it up, my dude. let's get this.
Part 70 Brad was right lol
Can you stop ending your videos the game is getting to good

Man ive been waiting for this brad. Keep up the amazing work
I was on part 54 yesterday and now im on 70. I was 20 videos behind i never thought i would say this again brad but MORE BRAD MORE
Why DAYS GONE was not for free the demo version?
Brad, use the LMG and Tommy gun on hordes mission(more ammo), explore to get crafting materials for the napalm cocktail, traps, etc and you also forgot to top up your ammo before leaving the camp
Waiting so much for this video ❤️ thank you brad
I love this game and how you play it. Keep it up
Brad bro what a game man and made more videos quick
Keep it comin Brad!!!Can't wait for the next video

My favorite YouTube brad I've been so up to date that I've been waiting for more vjds to com e out so I can have more to watch

My notifications aren’t working properly man wish I was here earlier how not convenient
this game is getting intense more and more... epic gameplay Brad well done and keep up the good work
thank you brad for another more days💖
Best part of the series bro.
wish you would give us 20 minuets of game-play and cut scenes were in overtime
This is sick man! Hello from Australia. Your a beast at eating games. Love it man.
Lol kinda wish Brad took that SMG sidearm :((
Love it,; " I don't care who you are; a 50 caliber is going to kill you ...like no doubt" LMAO
Thanks bro for the uploads
another video how CONVENIENT
Just finished this game myself, what a crazy good game this is... One of the best games I've ever played
Bro please spam this series untill it is finished
And nothing else 
Bcoz i can't wait for ending
You can’t never trust a dude who still wears a basketball jersey in 2019
Just woke up HOW CONVINIENT!!!
Deacan was a dbz character for a second "sonsabitches get the hella outta my wayyyyy!!"
Where is part 71 and 72 😧
i hope in game you get the chance to kill skizo. I want that mofo dead
Can you make your videos longer I have watched every single video
Ive been waiting how convenient. 😎
When you were in the infermary with Rikki, Skizzo looked and saw what Deek has on his back and now it all ads up
dude, get the damn SMP9!!!!
Go brad youre the best :))
U gotta hit us with part 71 soon Brad. This series is going crazy
Been here since part one bro hope you've been well can't wait to see how it ends!
Been waiting for your uploads for 4hrs. Dude i just wanna finish this game watching on your channel. Im from Philippines :)
It's been a long time since a game made me feel something. How the hell does this game have such low ratings??????
I'm angry; angry at the people who say this game is bad, and made at the game developers for making such good characters.
Thanks for the speedy uploads
Woke up to another vid thanks Brad🔥
Blyad I was late 42 minutes
Thx brad i have something to sleep too
first one ,, love u Brad
Yes brad keep spamming. The cliffhanger was killing me.
I just want these episodes to come out faster. The storyline is so good.
I cant believe it i finally caught up to the parts!
IM HOOKED PLEASE KEEP UPLOADLOADING THA 4 OR MORE VIDS A DAY TILL THIS GAME IS OVER TO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM FR BROTHA
You know, I can't help but wonder if this series would be a couple episodes shorter if you didn't have the 20-40 second intro at the beginning of each one.
20-40 seconds times 70 videos is quite a lot of time. Probably adds up to the length of a couple videos.
Upload more. Ending is getting getting better,  😊😁😊😊
I`ve never ever hated a character as much as i hate that son of a b*tch Skizzo. I don`t even hated Shepard as much as this God damn b*tch. Punched my desk so hard at the scene with Iron Mike... I can`t belive also how underrated this game is because of some.... yeah you know it.
omg the anticipation of waiting on these videos is killing me. this game is 100% without a doubt phenomenal
The lucky brad ,, he is gonna finish it soon....😆
I dont find any word to say you 
Just wow
Brad I am caught up with the series and I have a request plz upload faster!!
I never knew a video game would make me cry but damn man when iron Mike died.😭
woow  man this  was hard to  play i was like run run brad
I'm going to be real upset if I don't get to kill that POS Skizzo lol.
I don't want Skizzo or Colonel Garrett to die a slow death make them pay for what they done to Deacon and Sarah and let's just hope Rikki didn't jinx the game
Hey brad...love your gameplays. There is a reason you are king of walkthroughs. I just want you to finish days gone series. I cant handle this suspense. This is game is outstanding. I dont know why people says this game doesnt have a plot. On my opinon this game has a strong plot. The way different storylines are connected is just....incredible. love this game. SO FAR SO GOOD.
Need more brad..this game have a good stories...it's not a mistake that i've been watching it from part 1 till now..
I love days gone and i really love  the series
Keep it up Brad I love your gameplay videos 💯💥❤️
You know a game was good when you completed it but still watch it all again.

Bro I’m scared that the militia will kill of the camps up north like Copeland’s camp and iron mike’s
Congrats on 10mil bro! Whooo! I believe I’ve stuck around since you were at about 5.7, I think I found you through your Outlast/LoU and Gta5 - well outlast I think I just wanted to see you get scared a bit, but that’s where I began to really like your personality🤘
I'm a grown man tearing up for the death of iron Mike. Smh. Wow this game got me in my feelings.
This has to be the longest series ever
I thought game's gonna end here ! But more left
Endgame right there with you Brad!

Deacon out here turning super saiyan!
I was just a boy on part 1 i havn't seen the light in days until part 70 now i'm a fully grown man.
Rad if you finish this game 100 percent there's going to be a secret ending
Hey Brad, you're going to need a boat load of stamina for those horde missions. Not just health.
Captain kouri
They really should have listened and killed Skizzo
Man I absolutely love the series I wish it would never end. Please finish this one before you start up with another game
This may be the worst gameplay I’ve ever seen
More more moooooooreeeeeeeeeeeee
Next episode might be The Last one :(
Skizzo is the Vanilla Ice of the apocalypse , he is gonna go down just like Vanilla Ice his career :D
His weapon choice was so bad this episode 😂😂
When you beat the game can you please upload the side missions because that is cool and I know I'll never be able to play this game lol not with my time.
About time.... Evey 4 hours is not fast enough lol... Can't wait for the hour long end video. At least that's what I'm hoping.
Brad that gun u traded at the beginning its like the AUG its about I of the best smg guns in the game
I still don't get why people were complaining about this game before it come out
End is near thanks bro
im so happy that the game is so long! i love it i wish it  would go even more :D
Can you please post 40 minute episodes. It almost seems like that's fair!
Brad why you don't take the sidearm smg
WHERE IS THE PART 71???? ITS ALREADY PASS 5 HOURS
1=like
1=RIP FOR IRON MIKE
It's awesome content thanx can't wait to see that next videos.
My only question is who's going to sacrifice him/herself driving that suicide truck into that militia camp... Cause you already know that's a one way ticket
Good job an good game draw you in
Hey I know I was a little late to the party on this series but it just meant I could binge watch it for the last couple of days 😂😂 I just want to thank you for making the series and I appreciate your style of making these videos ( like giving the real experience of enjoying and playing the game along side you). I look forward to seeing more gameplay, I’m so excited to see the ending and experience along side you and everyone else that is supporting the series😄

U should drop the sniper now.. get the machine gun in special u will fight hordes and armies u will need a lot of bullets
Nothing like laying in your bed and watching brad play 🤙🏻
The graphics don't seem that great for PS4 PRO

If you come early Brad will Heart your comment

Hey Brad! Just wanted to write ye an appreciation post pal! 
I've had a battle with cancer the last 3 years, it's been mentally and physically draining but I tell you all I wanted to do was chill with my xbox or playstation but didnt have the mental focus or concentration to do so! I tell you man I've been spamming your channel for a while and didnt realise how helpful it uas to just chill and watch the game been played I've really enjoyed watching man and has been greatly beneficial to me over the last few years your one of the best streamers out there I find most annoying and talk over the video but you dont and you've a great personality too pal! Just wanted you to know your fine work is appreciated bro!❤

Keep it up brad keep going until u finish it
The motorcycle looks like the Ghost Recon motorcycle.
Face reveal???
I have a suggestion go live on Sunday and do horde missions apart from the story line so that we can interact with you so .. it would be separate from the main missions for a great experience and then you would be close complete the game closer when u start back the main story line missions
i Belive in this as a real life lol :D

Why couldn't deek go to the other camps and recruit more "soilders" to help fight the militia, and i hope skizzo dies a painful death.
@1:06 that sir is what we call a tavor. Sweet gun to shoot in real life. Its kinda funny that the name of it in game is "IDF pup" for israeli defense force bullpup hahaha
Yeah just go ahead and upload the rest now I know others will agree
Hell yah!!!
3:55 sounded like you hit water when you head shot that guy
Thanks, Brad, for all of excellent vids. I've enjoyed several of your walkthroughs for DG and several HL Mods. I use your vids on HL in case I get stuck, or to preview a Mod. No PS4, so you're providing me with vicarious play action. Keep up the great work!
U MISSED THE FLAME THROWET
wheres the early squad at
Didn't take the machine pistol omg
Can you do more of A Plague Tale
Wouldn’t it be cool if you can get Copeland’s and Tucker’s camp to help you fight the Malicia sorry if I spelled that wrong.

Watch all episodes weres 71 it like a movie man
These last parts are getting better and better
Deacon is a class act
I know it’s only a game but I had tears in my eyes when iron Mike died
One of best games I've seen and I have almost seen all. The haters are pathetic and small minded. People who hate on these game can't be a friend of mine.
I was sooooo waiting for this!!
i don't know where you're going but you didn't buy bullets right.
For Gods sake Brad slow down so I can catch up. Seriously, have you been putting out 6 or 7 episodes a day for the last week or so? All joking aside I'm loving the series and can't wait to see how it ends.
Yo, you need to post more I'm dying to see what happens.
New part... YES!!
Why i can’t access your 71st video?
OMG how come you suddenly suck at playing ? why do you always rush throug the game take your time and do it proper
Finally, why did you leave us on a cliff hanger brad?
See why I said Sarah made the right call shooting Jim? Iron Mike should not have let Skizzo walk... Damn Skizzo!
Yow! Iron mike! 😭😭😭
I wonder if he's gonna recruit Copeland and tucker to fight
Nooooo not mikeeeeee 😭😭😭😭
LETS GOOO BRAD!
Honestly I thought I wouldn’t like the other series you put out today, but once again it seems like I’m gonna be spending some time with you 😂
@theradbrad do you like the idea that syphon filter and days gone are in the same world or so a Theory suggests
that cutscene after iron mike was killed was kinda weak
WELCOME TO THE 70TH EPISODE OF DAYS GONE ON PS4
Nightmare House 2: Walkthrough - Part 1 ....I had to go back brad and watch this video just through your playlist because it goes back to when you started out... you say I got a guest with me the Holy Bible ..you really sound different all right lol that's when you would say wild words in your videos sound all hyper I do that myself I like to have fun when i make a recording too...ONLY IF PEPOLE KNEW ABOUT ME NOW   :)
doesn't feel like its been 70 episodes my oh my
more more more please
i loved mike he's like a grandpa to that camp
Well it's almost 80 😊
who cares if its a damn ps4 pro you ack like your better than us
What about the little sub machine gun, bro!?
here at 2 minutes which is pretty rare
I hope they recruit the other settlements like Copelands camp to help them even tho they  dont get along it will benefit them to from not being slaughtered by the militia
Love this series
Hey rad you can craft a stun gun in this game it looks amazing why dont you try to craft one?
Those snipers are so accurate
Where are the rest of the videos. Part 71-79
Couldn't have a better youtuber play a fantastic game!!
Love you brad... ❤️❤️
I will miss this series😩
So is there a way to game capture without sacrificing HDR and resolution higher than 1080p on console? Like how Brad’s description says PS4pro but I’m sure he has to record in 1080.
9:50 ;)
Using the wrong weapons on the wrong enemies, cant aim, always in bad shooting positions, and still doesn't die. This game is clearly too easy
20:53 It's Kouri, should take over the south camp after the crazy colonel's gone for good.
R.I.P 😭
You’ve answered my prayers 🙏🏽
Horde missions add them in series too brad
Ur waiting to long inbeetween to mske 1 come on already
19:06 drops trou ;)
Hello!!!!
Hi @theRadBrad, keep it up! IDF PUP is israeli IWI Tavor TAR-21 bullpup assault rifle (IDF stands for Israel Defense Forces). The one you had before was also bullpup - latest model of Steyr AUG - Steyr AUG A3-CQC. But this one is the most modern and sophisticated modular bullpup rifle up to day (US has it for sale for general public in semiautomatic version and quite popular).
Brads attention to detail is very bad, doesn’t even know kouris name and doesn’t realise that the car he pushed in the tunnel rolled back not disappeared
Another Great Video Brother!!!!!!!!
cool bro👍😎👍😎👍😎
Rikki looking snack able in the thumbnail.Besides that awesome series and great walkthrough Brad. And to the haters those of us who saw you play mafia 3. We saw what a repetitive game looks like.
22:54 look at what we have here. probably the last heavy and regular rippers alive.
Oh boy here we go!! Wonder what gonna happen next!!!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why are you recorded 23 minutes?
Pls make next part fast
Cant wait to get the game myself. I just wish there would be moments where you could make decisions that would affect the outcome of the end game. Other than that game seems perfect
i am still here
upgrade your bike
Nooooo iron mike
Brad the 🐐
ow yeah!!
Can you do a hour finale?
Like this brad ❤️
MORE PARTS PLS
Damn iron Mike's death hit hard...he just wanted peace and all he got was hate and war. Rest in piece old man.
Damn nowadays games looks so satisfying
Brad the rest of the series is private
3:27 -  3:45 bullet sponging ur way out of this eh?
Play the new ghost recon
I need the last 5 videos ASAP!!!!!!!!
more days gone woooooooooooooo
First the doc, then mike. Why must the likable characters die?
Dude.. You're really a crappy player.. But the vlogs are great..
Please do more of the other Plague game too
18:41 nice attention to detail with a mapp gas torch acting as a mig torch. Makes no sense cause there’s no wire feed or buzz box nearby.
Keep the good shit up immm keep whatching in till I get bored of video games and thats never
The hype ohh my god
i love you too rad keep you play days gone
Please increase  length of each video
Let's go Brad!!!!
When will u play Rage 2, Brad?

Let's finish this today brad . Spam em
Isn’t there a epilogue
Are you gonna be playing rage 2?
Hey Brad I think You must done all camp mission to get Trust lvl 3, I think at the ending mission, All camp will send people to help you attack the militia camp But I don't think so hehe cause I don't know it will happen or not cause I check many youtubers that play Days Gone, Someone play it and then all the people at Tucker, Copeland, and Iron Mike camps together help Deacon attack Militia Camp and the other Youtuber, they not come to help Deacon, only Rikki, Addy and the others at the Iron Mike camp help him to attack militia camp, I don't know hehe, Just giving my opinion
HORDE TIME !!!~!
Next part right now
Keep them coming
Love the videos
Hi love you
gets shot 30 times in 1 min still alive
5 more to go!
You know , Brad I wanna thank you for keeping me going while I've been sick. I feel like Iron Mike on his death bed coughing like that and my runny nose. These videos have kept me going and I wanna say thanks I've been a subscriber since idk 2011 maybe. All I know is that i remember when you did GTA V. thank you so much for keeping these videos coming. I've been thinking of getting a PS4 and buying Days Gone just because you make the game look so amazing.
god damn Skizzo...
love watching but here some recommendations, Change up the whole "lets get this" after the 50th time it was super cringy and i skip ahead. secondly, try and work on the observation and awareness of objectives and fights, as i said i enjoy watching you and the reason i dont watch other lets plays is its absolutely heartbreaking and physically painful to sit there and watch someone run by an objective for 5 mins while commenting. i hate it. but with you ive tolerated it because i enjoy your commentary and videos. take a moment and gather your senses to properly complete objectives it makes for better gameplay over all. love the vids hope to see more! CHEERS!!
Hay rad love the videos
Brad your videos are the best
i'll wait the next video
Brad love ur series
I try not to watch these before I get to the part I’m watching haha
No thanks. Can't wait till it ends.
Three hour live marathon

Aaaaaaaarrrgggg... Neeed mooorree... More videos!!!
That sound at 3:57 when you slow motion popped that dude in the head sounded so off and hilarious.
Why you change the sub machinegun man
I feel like Deek’s plan could’ve been better if he added the factor of freaks, they could’ve led a Horde to the camp where the colonel is, the truck creating an opening for them and he could sneak in, in the chaos and take Sarah out of the camp.
RIP Mike
Come on brad make another one man !!!!!
Pepega
FIRST
More Plague tale!
Hey there, thanks
Yeaass
Yeahhhhh
Wow nice vid man
Use an AR
Almost done ... :(
Part 100 ?
Yeet wasa
Spoiler warning :at the end all the camp unite and attack The militia And skizoo die
Rip
Hey just wondering, what’s your favourite PS4 game?
Oh man this game is getting pretty much boring
Skizzo and Micah are like One in the same
not sure if you're really high playing this game or whatever but its so frustrating to watch  2:36 - 8:50 . cant you just change the clip to another footage of you playing this part decently?  its supposed to be a finally right?
i think having to kill that many hordes is starting to feal to repetitive its like all there is at the end
Thank god
They want war!
Hi
Hi
has a 50. cal, tries to shoot them with a pistol
I love these videos👍👍👍
Give me rent!
Alright
Amazing
Damn
I so can’t wait to see the bomb go off
Yayayayayayayaayayayaya
Am I the only one who thinks that part of the game was cut or something like once he gets to the camp all the fighting is done and when iron mike dies deak says skizzo shot iron mike but not once does it say how he got shot
UPLOAD FASTER RAD PLEASEEEEE🙏🙏🙏
It’s going down
This game looks extremely boring, ps4 can keep their wack exclusive.
40
How episodes left?
I hope they make games realistic like mount and blade bannerlord. Here 1 man killing 100 of them is so unrealistic. Atleast let the poor mam have companions with him.
Before you're going the horde mission,you need to prepare your supplies like fuse boom, grenade,and others bomb and including the big Molotov and the small molotov too. You need a plan to kill the horde cuz that mission is the hardest. Its the biggest horde. So goodluck to you Brad!
Brad,go back to the place that you started at. There is a sub machine gun that you can get by killing 4 hordes
Rap
were there rippers shooting at the end?
Omg omg omg omg omg omg
yeet

This might've been the best episode yet. Plz moar good sir.
6ix9ine anyone? cuz ya know part 69?




alright I'll stop
is anyone going to talk about how brad chuckles? no offense
I would have killed Skizzo too. Long before he had a chance to do this.
69? you know what that means! ;)




nothin
I saw Kouri wearing the ring like 5 episodes back (if it was that ring) He was wearing a ring and jewelry wasn't allowed.
"I'm gonna throw every chair around me" it's funny cause he isnt sitting down, hes standing.
OH SNAP a twist  "How convenient"
I am straight addicted to this series. Cannot wait for each new episode! This storyline is better than most shows on tv. Keep it up Brad!!
Other episode HOW CONVENIENT!

hi
I am sure that Garret is crazy and it was in love with the doctor and his death make him more crazy. And if he was true Cristian he will know the 10 commandments and that he says is not in the 10 commandments. It is on exodus if he does not know to different that I think is crazy 100%. It will be e
Ironic to find out that before the virus he escape a madhouse.

Yessssssssssss
Just simply thank you brad!
I wish you popular “Let’s players” would actually do it for any reason besides money. You’re supposed to be dedicated to the game you play. Not slow down and start playing other games, even quitting before you finish, just because views are slowing down. Y’all are doing it for the wrong reason

Dude stop say thanks every minute :D But for real we dont need that, im not sayin' any bad, we are like you and your content,  you making time in this so WE are say thanks for all the 69 (now its 71 i believe) Part of the gameplay. Im not from the US, all my english "skills" is from games and YouTube things like that, but i do watch Your gameplays, not the ones with my language. Yes, you are a cool normal guy with respect to subscribers, quality content and let us listen to every story and speaking in-game :D  Big like for you +1 subscriber (If you say thanks in the comment i just explode and eat my socks :3)
In brad's videos i hear him saying "Endgame" and it got me thinking he was talking about Marvels Endgame😅😅😅
Things just got spicy 





I’m sorry I’ll leave 😐

Yeah I watched all the videos and now I'm waiting for new ones
COME ON JUST POST THEM ALL AT ONCE THIS IS SO AGONISING
HA 69
Nice. (im sorry i needed to do it.)
This game is overrated but theradbrad is underrated
2 things, skizzo better get what he deserves because many games let people like that live because they don't exist anyway, and kouri is the best
the story got very interesting , we want more videos a day .. Spam us,Brad
Appreciate the support you show on this! They allowed me to post it early so I got this first video up. I'll have more Days Gone in a few hours for those wondering. Thanks for any and all likes you drop on this video.
HUGO : *knows that both his parent died
 BRAD : "How convenient.. "
The dog really just died like that 😐

And also their whispering sounds like talking loudly but silently
Not even ten minutes in and I'm tearing up over the poor dog😢😢😢
HUGO: About to be burned alive
BRAD: cAn I fEeD tHe ChIcKeNs??
It looks like those unreal engine 4 demo games videos
game: 1- ᎢᎻᎬ ᎠᎬ ᎡᏌNᎬ ᏞᎬᏩᎪᏟY

me: dE RuNe SanDstOrM
Guard: where is Hugo DE RUNE!!?
Tree: ......
Guard: *stabs tree.
I can`t even remember when I found your Channel 😂
This is a sponsored video, so he is playing it.
He will upload days gone still.
This helps support Brad. 
Chill.
Here we are again, the lack of gaming conscious..
Respect to those servants. They stayed loyal till the very end. If that were me, i would've talked by a single punch
well.. 90% of the times the dog gets killed in such games..rip
She really killed an armored man with a slingshot...
Found your channel when you played Detroit become human. Your gameplay was my favorite.
47:13
"No wait we just want to leave."
Straight kill the man
33:26 see a marked door 

"Oh this door look promising"

Glad you not lived where black death become a pandemic in europe 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
42:20 hugo runs away

theRadBrad: *checks out armor then proceeds in complimenting the armor *
Well, new series... cool.
Hugo: hello?
Me: he is a cinnamon roll that must be forever protected-
Hi bro love from India....
Please keep uploading this game.....
Huge fan btw
"Ps4 pro gameplay" doesn't even record in 4k.. fuken Nice :)
I've actually been curious about this game from seeing screenshots, so I'd like to see a bit of it in action. I may very well pick this one up if it's interesting, so gonna start watching your video now!
This better be a good game
sees the character petting the dog
HOW CAN I LIKE A VIDEO TWICE
Most definitely keep playing this!! I'm mysteriously intrigued!!!!!
so does the dog come back as a boss monster later on?
I found your channel when you were uploading Arkham Asylum Videos
"i can smell something cooking, is it fair?"


no definetely no 

just no
I started watching and subscribe to you when i was really into horizon zero dawn and really enjoyed watching you play and help me get through some of the task and missions
Bro it would help a lot if you didn't talk while everyone around you in the game is talking. personally I'd like to hear what the npc's are saying since this is a story driven game.
Shout out to the best YT gamer!! Keep up the good work!!! Started watching your videos last year and now I am addicted!! Thank you
I found your channel when you were playing deadrising 3.PS4
Yo brad please please please continue this series!!! been watching you since black ops 2 campaign
Brad pls do the diamond play button unboxing and love your vids brad
Been watching since 2012.
 Love your videos . I really need that ps4 copy . Much love:)
I found your channel when you were playing Silent Hill Downpour!
Ironically I first met you looking for someone to see if anyone got passed the level 5 in Amy. 

And I subbed for Downpour.
I've got exams atm and your videos really help me relax. Thanks! 👍
Please play full game! So interesting already! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I found your channel during the FarCry5 play through. Really enjoyed it and went back to watch other playthroughs!
I found your channel in 2017 with your watchdog 2 playthrough!
Found your channel when you were playing Silent Hill Downpour.
Wow, such a beautiful game.
HOW DARE YOU START A NEW SERIES

Chill I'm just kidding
It’s been a few years since I found your channel. I think my first series was the first telltale walking dead season.
That old lady is Alvor the Blacksmith mom lol..."Here's what you need to craft or upgrade your weapon"
Been a fan for several months... Your playthroughs remind me of me and my friends sitting around doing commentary while the others play. Great job! Keep it up!
Hi Brad I've been subbed for at least 8 if not more years really like your content keep on working hard and i hope lifes great 😃🙏👍
Use this as a finish DAYS GONE button
I found your channel in 2012 in the original ac3 walkthrough.
I found your channel 3 years ago. You are one of the only youtubers that actually play story games and for that I thank you. Keep doing what you are doing.
Brad : If you guys like it.....

1 million views in six days 😂
"This seems like a nice game."
dog incident happens
"Nevermind."
Me: it's already 4 am I should sleep
Brad:" uploads video "
Me:well how convenient
Found your channel with you trying out MK11, been hooked since!
Anyone of you guys wants to ruin brads day, just make a game and put a cute dog in it and then right after 8 mins in the game kill that Dog.
Watching the Spider-Man game I found you.
I found your channel ages ago when you played InFamous, actually ^^
Hey! I see a lot of comments demanding you play Days Gone. I think this game has amazing potential and story! In any case, I'm looking forward to seeing your playthrough. Thanks for your hard work Brad.
I found your channel during the amnesia series! That game was chilling but I felt like I had a very relatable buddy with me going through it.
Hmmm i do not like her accent, french grammer lessons flashbacks
Found your channel when you did outlast in 2013 and have been watching ever since
Ok so listen! I found out about you playing tomb raider and I freaking love you!! So I just saw this game and I'm like "ok I'm kinda getting a tomb raider vibe" and my little brother agreed with me. I I picked some random video and when I heard your voice I kinda fangirl lol! So yeah I really want this game for my Xbox one but if I don't win it's totally fine just wanted to tell that I love you and your channel ok...bye!✌🏽
I found your channel a few years ago, I think during MGSV release. My nephew showed me your channel because I prefer to watch Lets Plays instead of official reviews to determine if I'm going to buy a game. You've got some of the best Lets Plays plus it helps that you get everything early now so I cab decide before release! :)
I've been watching you since assassins creed 3 😂 it has been a long time hah
I found your channel when you were doing the amazing spider-man walkthrough. And I have been watching ever since except when it is a game I wanted to play myself but nevertheless keep up the good work
You got your 20k likes...part two please :)
-Dog dies.
-Dog fans have left the building. Go back to Skyrim. At least there you help a dog find his master. xD
Idk the image u choose in you video reminds of the last of us
Theradbrad:*plays this game*
**after playing the game


TheRATbrad
I discovered your channel with Days Gone ! Totally worth it 😱
1:46 "The fact that you can pet the dog, I like it"
Aegon Targaryen aka Jon Snow listen to this, pet Ghost damn it!
First found your channel when you did your halo 5 play through sand I’ve watched ever since
I found your channel relatively recently, when I was looking for a good AC Odyssey playthrough! Really enjoyed watching yours, and have been looking forward to this game, so I had to check this out as well.
i found theRadBrad's channel back in i think 2016 through beta release of we happy few episode
I found your channel when you played Batman Arkham City. Been watching ever since. Great content and funny and entertaining commentary 🙂. Keep up the good work Brad. I would love to win a copy on PlayStation 4.
Showing affection to your dog is a must. Good job sir.
Rad brad ,love from India .I always felt when you upload any game,I would watch it at night before sleep to relax myself as i am watchin a  movie with a close friend.Thanks for being there
I found your channel back when you started playing the walking dead.
I remember I found your channel in the 2009 sometimes i wouldn't watch your video but i would always leave a like..even if i don't watch your awesome videos i am still here to support you c: also if i get picked then i would like a ps4 one please for my little sister dad since his birthday is coming up which is on May 23
Found your channel back when you played CoD MW4 ❤️ been a fan ever since.
Me: wants to sleep
Brad: Upload Video
Me: Oh well let do this!!!
never seen a slingshot as a deadly weapon before :v
Oh my goodness, so many years ago did I find your channel. Jeez...maybe 2013? I watched you play the last of us. And I remember you telling us about getting Chubs. Because I have 2 corgis.
I found your channel in like 2013 or something like that. but fb would unsubscribe me
I found your channel when I was thinking about buying the surge. Watched you play it for awhile and ended up buying the game. I love your videos man. I would love to win a copy for xb1
Please do this game! Even if you have to wait till days gone is finished, Plague Tale has so much potential, so please continue this even if you finish Days Gone first. I've really been hoping you'd play this game, theRadBrad!
found you a total of 3 years ago and have been watching since then
Im a cat person but my tears starting to drop when the dog died
i found your channel when you started playing the walking dead telltale series! it was amazing to see the progression of the characters and the choices you made ahahah
47:12   Amicia - we just want to leave


brad - continues to aim like it was days gone.
Started watching you when COD Ghosts came out and you did it's Campaign (Xbox)
Brad a few questions: I've not gotten a PS4 yet

1. If I get a 500gig, how hard is it to mod(with a 1tb drive?
1a. What be drive would be best?
2. Should I spring for a pro.. I've heard many games won't play on Slims
When you're 5 day late no one to talk with😭😭
Fernando from Paladins “deaths sweet embrace”
I have a theory that hugo is god of the rats because he has their plague and as they were escaping the beginning rats were emerging from the ground
Days gone First death: Leon 
Plagues tale first death: Leon 

Hmm......
Dude you are awesome, i dont have the money to buy the game even ps4 hahaha but thanks to your walkthrough I enjoy watching the games you play hahaha how convenient with your voice
That ponytail animation is tripping me out, That's not how physics work :/
I found you channel back in 2013 watching The last of Us
You should try the French vo. It's betyer since that's originally their language in the game.
Why does this game remind me of we happy few?😂😂
I found your channel in 2013 when you were playing the last of us for the first time.Been a fan since then!
I really like how almost every servant (even though they just take care of the estate) never tell the inquisition anything even though they'll probably be killed for it.
I found your channel during your resident evil two days and thought your stand back six feet joke was hilarious and have always kept up with your videos because of your charisma
666 Dislikes lmao what kind of devilry is this.?
I See what you mean. It's very silent with multiple hills XD
I think I found your channel back in 2013 when you started playing Dead Space 3, because I was looking to see the review on that game, (I worked on the project) and I was really excited and happy to see someone playing it. I really enjoyed watching your walkthroughs and I kept watching ever since, especially when I know I wont have time or I can't afford to buy the game and play it. I just put your vids on and do my stuff. Keep it up! <3
I found your channel when GTAV just came out and you did a playthrough❤️
I watched the whole thing!
they both have seen each and every death so far...the ptsd is gonna be stacked like a pokemon on battle roids.
That intro reminds me of another game...
Farcry 3
Naaah....
Brad been a fan since 2013 you're a God man keep it up
I found your channel way back during deadspace I couldn't afford the game at the time and became addicted to your content been here ever since
I found your channel right about the time the last of us came out
This game looks intriguing!  Thanks for the video Brad! I have been a fan since I discovered your channel with The Evil Within vid series.  Keep doing what you do man, you're fabulous!
I found your channel when you did Batman arkham knight
RadBrad is the ideal YouTuber. Gaming.
Don't remember exact time I found your channel, but I think the game was Prototype 2 :3
that first dude you plugged in the face with the sling 😂
This is the only channel i love to watched walkthroughs, and i like ur sexy voice.

HOW CONVENIENT 😂
Edited: how did dis comment get a like
Been watching your channel since dead space. Can't believe it's been that long to be honest.
Love watching your videos!  First discovered your channel when you played OUTLAST!
Aye yo hugo is either a half breed vamp or a werewolf how much yall wanna bet, only reason i say vamp is becuase of them saying vamps
Game looks beautiful but the voice actors sounding like they are in a empty room when they are really out in a forest kills it!
When Hugo went under the hole I literally saw a wall where you can climb so I said bruh
Crazy how many subs you have! I literally watched you back when you had less than 500k. You were the first game walkthrough youtuber i ever watched! And still my fav 😁
You need to play life is strange 2
I just started your Until Dawn playthrough. (late to the party lol) You're great at what you do, man!
The thing I like about this game is that it shows us how we are so used to death in video games. While the main character, not having to have experienced such tragedy, is frightened by it.
Beautiful.
Ive heard that human flesh smells sickening. I think that boy has a problem.
Rats remind me of people on black Friday
Me when I see a dog with the game called plague: nope I’m not watching a animal death
hey brad. i'm really happy that you decided to play this game. i found your channel back when u were playing dead rising 2. keep up the good work. love your stuff.
is it me or i can't seem to 100% finish protecting the weak? 🤔
I Got an ad for a plague tale  :edit two times
I found your channel last year randomly, and I've seen many games since. I've never won anything in my life before and I don't know if you gave the games away already, but this would be awesome.
Great  job on this channel , keep up the good work, I wanna check their new game out when i can
found your channel a couple years ago as I was looking for a decent walkthrough of Bloodborne
looks well boring, cant even imagine playing it twice.
omg its been years since i have found your channel!! i think u was playing silent hill.. its been that long and i still love ur personality and u in general !!
It sounds like every guard has the same voice..
"A man's gotta eat..." haha. Love that bro!
Brad: I guess hugo want to get burn alive
Me: that would be the first game to kill a kid brutally
Voice acting is honestly painful ;_;
Game looks great, gunna watch the first episode then dip, don't wana spoil it all for myself
This is my new personal game of the year.
Brad at 26:35 the mother tells you what to do you didn’t have to use a combination
Yo Brad I've been following this game for a while now and it looks sick, and i found your channel during your playthrough of Watch Dogs in 2014 you're the reason i got the game
Hey @theRadBrad, I just really want to thank you for your hardwork in giving us content in such short times. I really appreciate it and I respect you greatly for making so many videos in such a short time. Keep up your good work :) We fans will keep on supporting you!
rad can i win a game bro an i been commenting for a while lol i was with u since u were in the hundreds can i just win one......btw much love to u man an keep up the good work i will always be a fan no matter what

found your channel way back during your murder soul suspect series and I've been watching you since. Love your content made keep it up
Clervie Reminds me of Mrs. Doubtfire...Robin Williams
Hey friend!

I had to have found your channel back when I was in middle school, between 2011 and 2014. Now I'm in college, and I always feel nostalgic when I read your username and hear your voice. I really appreciate it. It's the little things that help people get through their day
Finished watching all of days gone videos then saw this how convenient
Can't even watch a video game without hearing about Game of Thrones. Geez
I am getting some the last of us vibes from this and I LOVED the last of us......I am not rly sure when I started watching u but I think It was  back in 2015 since then u are #1 walkthroug chanall for me.Keep up the good work
The video is off and unclear but your commentary makes it worth it.
Let me just say, this channel has been one of the most reliant gamer channels on YouTube. Brad is so humble and plays some of the best games! 

Thank you so much for all these years. I find myself loosing interest and then coming back over and over again simply cause Brad has one of the best personalities! So personable. Every time I come back it’s still the same old Brad who has the same fun commentary.

Kudos! Love you, Brad!
Who else thought of dishonored when they saw rats in the title screen?😂
Been a fan of yours since you had 1 mil. Keep it up
I’ve been watching your channel since the Until Dawn series! I really enjoy watching you play it’s like watching a tv show. Would love to win a copy for either system. Keep up the great videos, Brad! 🙌🏼
This game is amazing! I hoping 1 of the comments wud say that b4 I dived in, but then I gleamed it 4 myself.
This game looks great! Your commentary is funny as always. I found your channel years ago during your playthroughs of Dead Island and Walking Dead Season 1. Whichever came first lol
I can’t help but say.... THIS STUPID LITTLE BOY
Love finding new content on this channel, haven't heard of this game before this but I love it
Found your channel from Farcry 4 walkthrough 😊🤙
i smell SKYRIM's NPCs.. lol
Found your channel when I was watching you play through The Last Of Us. Keep up the amazing work man.
I have a ps4 and brad i been seeing your channel grow since Dead Island, great and funny moments lol.
I watched his channel first when he played Metro Exodus. 😂 It hasn’t been long, but I love ethics community and your vids Jack! 👍🏻
WHEN'S THE NEXT EP. BRAD!? I really love your channel, I watch your vids 24/7. I hope you have an amazing time playing this, cause I sure do have a good time watching your videos!! I started watching you when you played Mw2!!!
Brad.. been watching your videos for years and years! Always been a fan 🤙
The intro is making me uncomfortable oml
I can’t wait for you to keep playing this!!
I was dying laughing at Brad's commentary during this part LMFAO
Please play the game this is exciting me to death, please
i hope this game dosen't make people hate brits. we already have enough on our plate
Oh Must of been the Wind,😀😀
Always like seeing some gameplay.  Found you playing Fallout New Vegas.
Found your channel June 14, 2013
Y’all must obviously forgot this is a gaming channel, don’t nobody want to see one game forever. I want to see more of this. Keep it up Brad👍🏾
Good game and video I like your channel and gameplay
hugo still a kid.. but he is annoying cmiiw. nice game.. where's theres no Indonesian youtuber (Gamer) who played this game yet. I always search your name "TheRadBrad". While searching new game  walktrough/LetsPlay. If i search for a new game in youtube randomly, your name show up. I like your content xD
Hey, great videos!
Found the channel a few months ago. Don't really have the time to play all the games I would like to, so I end up watching your videos while I work. Allowing the cutscenes and story to play out, helps to see and enjoy the game even without playing it.
Thanks!
I found your channel recently with the Days Gone videos. Would like to win a Ps4 copy of this game 👍. Good luck everyone
I'm not a dog person but seeing what happened to the dog scarred me a little.
I started to watch you since the new god of war
I found your channel in 2017
I started watching ur videos when u were around 4mil
Found your channel when you played far cry 3 which is like 5-7 years ago? Please pick me 
(｡•́︿•̀｡) and also i dont have twitter anymore. The dog 😭
Whats up Sir,  Have been watching since the last of us.  Always great content from your channel.  More videos of this game please

I found you when searching for The Last of Us game play. What a great game! (xbox)
Found your channel when i was looking for a COD: Ghosts video.. Brilliant videos man..
Hey Brad I'd love to get this game for x box I found your channel when you played portal 2 I'm not to sure what time that was but I've been a huge fan for a long time please keep up the awesome work you da best
So far this is the most paintully on rails game I have seen.  Hope it opens up soon because this is SO LINEAR.
Huge fan of the channel brand,  keep up the good work! xbox user btw
Found your channel while you were playing dead space 2 and the time i just got ps3. Good times
Anyone else find Amicia extremely attractive. Like seriously attractive.
Me: I don't wanna sleep
Brad uploads new video
Me: HOW CONVENIENT
I honestly, do not know, how I keep ending up on your channel.
Ik sweetheart, when my dog gets nearly half eaten then gets pulled underground by an unidentified being, I too have the initial reaction of trying to jump after him.
This seems very interesting. Let's see where this rabbit hole ends up
Love your content. I started watching the Days Gone videos you slammed out.
I found your channel when you started playing Dead Rising 3 & every time i want to watch a campaign walkthrough i know where to find it lol. Love the videos man 👍🏽
Found your channel my jr year in high school i was always too broke to buy the games so i got to enjoy you play them
Lol I really hate how you play games it's like there's no skills
I found your channel when you played I Am Alive waaaaaaaaaaay back, Love your videos man, Keep up the good work
I horrible when I watch scary games cause I pretty sure the kid has is like the antidote. 🙃 I havent heard about this game so that's a first impression.
Well this was Ned Stark all over again...
I appreciate your playthrough videos. It has made me consider a console purchase.

Thank you
I actually started watching u since ur batman Arkham city walkthrough 7 years ago, keep up the good work❤️
The game is btw gorgeous, ikd about consoles but on pc 1440p max sittings it looks amazing
the start kinda reminds me of fable then it turned into the last of us.
The first videos I remember seeing over on your chyannel were the good ol' Halo 4 videos... Damn that was a while ago. How about everyone else, when did you first find the TheRadBrad channel.

Also yeah I'd keep going on with this series, looks like it has a lot of potential. :D
I found your channel back a couple years ago and found your lets plays quite entertaining. You had a relaxed vibe to your videos that no other channel offers. I love it for unwinding and the entertainment of your reactions to what happens in game
would have been better with better voice actors idk, maybe its just me
This is old French the inquisition is from france
Immediately goes and likes the other 2 parts he's released so he won't stop
Found you channel when you were playing AC3 and was hooked and subscribed during your Halo 4 walkthrough
David and goliath well Amica and Conrad.
Its the same publisher as Vampyr Brad same as the call of cthulhu
You're my number one person to go to for reliable and constant content on new releases! I do watch mark, jack, and pewdiepie but the experience I get from you is different lmao. I started watching you when TLOU came out
Hmm. PROgress and proGRESS. Are there any other words in the English language that have a different meaning based on which syllable gets the emphasis?
Finally; i was waiting for this; 

Yes @theRadBrad; post more videos for this (-:
Sir Gregor aka The Mountain.
Don't forget to play Tom Clancys Breaking Point soon brah :)
The only thing i wanted was nothing to happend to the dog...........WHHHHHYYY!!!!!!
I started watching in 2012. Me and my now wife would binge your walking dead play through. Keep up the awesome work man. Ps4 btw
If it wasn't for the subtitles,  it sounds like the dog's name should be Leon instead of Lion, RIP either way... Anyway, keep up the fantastic work.
Xbox.  I forgot when I found your channel, I think it was somewhere in 2016 or 2017, watching Dead Rising 3.
I love you 3000, Brad❤
I found your channel I believe it was around 6 years ago. Hoping to win the copy of this game! Excited to see you play it!
In my opinion, all games are now featuring a "pet the dog" option, because they all known Brad is going to like it :)
Screw this game, it killed a dog! 😞
Thank you for this look into the game. It  seems to be a nice one (no zombies so far..). And it will come out for XBox too.  Hope for some more parts while i am watching the ending of Days Gone. Keep going. You are my favourite Youtuber..:-))
I haven’t heard of this game!! I will be purchasing this game tomorrow. Great video.
Found your channel probably 2013ish love the vids
I was hoping for more exploring the game's detail but this is still as good as always
I found your channel when I was looking for a gameplay for Heavy Rain. Then I was amazed by your voice (I really like hearing your voice) and loved the choices you made in Heavy Rain, I binged watch almost all of your gameplay after that. 🤘
Excited for this playthrough!

I think I found your channel when you played The Last of Us
The child has stolen my heart. HE MUST LIVE!
i started watching around the time you played Horizon Zero Dawn
Joined your channel after your AC:O play through!! Super good stuff.
Looks interesting, and really good. Brad found your channel 5 years ago with infamous second son. Been watching you ever since, and I appreciate all the hard work you do. thank you for making great content.
you pet dog, I hit like. any disagreements?
Actually love this game and you Brad!! Ps4 all the way 👌🏻❤
Are you going to replay ghost wild lands the new one
Andddddd......lion dead!!!

Rest in peace...lion!......such a good doggo!!
I found your chanel in 2013 and I loved your dying light series
Hey rad Brad ur huge fan from Pakistan and I have been watching you since 2013
Please finish the game and make regular uploads, It looks very interesting!


found your channel when you played The Last of Us, been a fan ever since.
Comment contains spoilers for this video. 


If that had been my dog I would have dove in after her. I can’t believe they had to start on such a heartbreaking note! Damnit. Why the dog?!?! Anything but the dog!!
I might have to watch you Brad. I reached the dog scene and had to pause the game.  That affected me.  And if the game affected me that much I don't want to know how much worse it can get
Definitely liked the video. I found your channel back when you only had 10,000 subscribers. It's good to see how far you've come! I will definitely be playing this if/when I get this, the moral systems are so intriguing! I love the idea of 1 hit kills and consequences for your actions. See you later RadBrad!
Must be nice to make a living playing games,brads on easy street....getting paid very well doing what you love,
Only Big brothers/sisters are the pros at this game , Since they take care of younger siblings XD
I found your channel way back when you played Dead Rising 1. Haven't fallen off since ^^
Of course the dog dies gruesomely.
Hugo asks to many questions. And as a big sister she needs to tell him "shut up we trynna escape" ..
New Red Dead 2 DLC looks good
Is this the story Jack Marston always talking about
Would love to see the whole game.  Thanks for days gone.
damn.  i just know she's going to die and i'm going to cry about it.
Seems like a interesting game, but played pretty quickly I guess. That poor dog so sad 😥 thanks for sharing your video 😉
I found your channel when you were playing saints row
I think the thing that ate the dog is connected with Hugo cause the guard said where’s your son he killed 2 of my men
Discovered your channel a while back and watch your videos just to get a sense of the game. Really helps me to decide whether to buy it or not!
Its not a Brad video without the “Heeeeeeey buddy!”
Hey! I love your videos! I have been a subscriber for about 2 years! Keep up the good work!
Found your amazing channel on dead rising 3 been here to watch the person you became it’s cool❤️
Found your channel a couple of weeks ago when I'm playing TLOU and stumble upon your walkthrough after that your channel is my go to, for a walktrough to check if the game is good. Keep up the good work
I had a feeling you were gonna have a feeling about something obvious
I found your channel this year and so far your the most entertaining gamer I’ve seen🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
only just come across your channel, so glad to see gameplay for this game, i've been thinking about getting it but wanted to see some gameplay before deciding.
been watching you for years mate. love chubbs! started watching when you played Gears of War 3.
Does anybody find it funny that you find rocks on the shelves and crates but not the floor
>nobody

> theradbrad: post when you found my channel

Liked and found your channel looking for hellblade walkthroughs lol one of the best games I've ever played
First started watching your videos back when Dying Light first came out. Always loved your commentary!
Do more of this game
I found your channel during TWD Survival Instinct videos in 2012 maybe
From accidental find to actually finding a gem xd I love your vids dude. Found your channel when u played until dawn. Man it was intense
I found your channel since the MGSV days lmao u just straight up finish the game
Found your channel when I first saw god of war (2018) game, don't have a console but your videos were a very good alternative, thanks radbrad
Noooo doggie died ... How dare you Brad? U could have told us
Looks pretty good
I hope you keep up the good work and have a nice day(or in my case night)
Lost me at the stealth sections. No game has ever made stealth sections fun.
Thank you for the presentation of the video.
Looks like a very interesting game!
@18:34 never fck with a mother's child
Hey Brad...I found this beast of a channel about 3 years ago! You still have the best playthroughs💪...Tbis game looks sick btw😱

Just love you brad. What ever game you play they are just fantastic ❤️♥️
THANK YOU!!!! OMG BRAD THANKS!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO PLAY THIS GAME!
I don't have anything on the game, no offense and i did like it but really they can't just go throught the knights as simple as this, the developers should have think of something better.
Me again LOL.... but PLEASE continue videos for this gameplay!!! Whether I get it from you or buy it myself, I will need you!!! ;)
I played this for the  first time today and it reminded of tomb Raider kinda
one day I was looking for a video to watch and i saw your video so it was dead spece
I found your channel a few months ago honestly and the videos I first watched was the walking dead series :D ever since then you’ve been my favorite gamer to watch gameplays!
Man I'm almost done with days gone and this looks like my next YouTube series. Keep it up
Found channel searching for this game
hey , nice video
Found your channel back in 2013 

have a nice day!
Please play plague tale fully through.
I'm gonna continue when I wake up can someone tell whether there are jumpscares
a sling can launch a fist sized rock at speeds nearing 100mph the pressure it impacts with is near the same as a handgun.....yeah it does alot of damage
Poor dog...I have this game. I haven't played it yet. It's very beautiful.
Nobody: 
Brad: How Convenient
See what happens when you play a real game! 1m views wow!!!
Your voice is deeper than like 2 years ago
Love ya Brad and I'm looking forward to playi ng thiss
OMG ! i love this game so much💙
thank you so much brad🌹
23:00 I thought dude was thanking the guards for letting him go, then I realized it's all English. Lol
This game looks awesome. Please play the whole game and i started watching you in 2011 keep up the good work Brad
this reminds me a lot of skyrim!
“I’m supposed to hit it from the back” 😂😂😂😂😂
Started watching when you played Beyond Two Souls! You've been one of my favorite YouTubers for game plays 😊
Hey Brad! Started watching your channel about 8 years ago when you were playing Dead Rising 2! It's been a crazy ride watching your channel grow the way it has. Can't wait to see what else you have in the future!
Hey brad love you vids been watching you since mw3
3:00 i bet the dog is infected, or kills the father or somethin
Those helmets cover these guys eyesights making them the blindest guards ever
No. Post more days gone. Lol love you Brad.
26:03 amicia whisper and the guard did not hear it??? and the guard is much more closer
I've been waiting for a new playthrough 🙌🏿
I found ur channel back in state of decay days
This game looks beautiful but the gameplay looks terrible.
Hey brad! love from india i found your channel last year and i saw dead space as the first video😍♥️! would love to win giveaway for ps4
The killed dog reminded me of JoJo...
It's funny he always says he wants to see how the video does. When has his content not done well?
Great first video! Hope to see way more of it!
I found your channel like a year or two ago, when I was bored on YouTube. Stuck with your playthroughs ever since, cause I normally cant afford the games it's great to see them being played by someone who enjoys them as much as I would❤
I think this game is awesome in its own way. I remember I found your channel a long long time ago. It was back when Dead Space 2 released. I thoroughly enjoy your content and have always supported your journey. Thanks for the great content.
Poor lion. I literally cried. 

Good game though. I would have loved it if lion wasnt dead. 😟😢
Just found your channel today. Loving the video, I subbed and liked. I will be watching a loy more.
Your videos get me through the day man! Love them, keep up the great work!
I first found your channel back when you originally played the dead space games
I always wanted te date a french girl, tell her to call me lion with that accent.
I found your channel from the Catherine playthrough back in 2012
Ohhh I found your channel when Alien Isolation came out! I was low key terrified of the game and your channel helped me get through it hahahaha
I was going to watch this series, but I won't be anymore. It's not cool to kill off dogs. The only thing I find unacceptable in games.
I found your channel in 2012 for farcry 3
I found your channel when you were below 500k subscribers I always leave comments to receive free games never get one though but would be happy to get this one/much love your faithful subscriber
Hordes are waiting Brad. Hordes are waiting...
It's funny how all of those guards lack periferal vision
Dude if this is about the beast of geveadon
I found the chanal during the most recent god of war
I found your channel your during the Arkham city days and boy I’ve not regretted my life since!

I found your channel in 2012 when I was looking up YouTube videos of telltale's the walking dead season 1, and I have been watching ever since. 😎🧟‍♀️
Like. Now I have a chance to win this game.

The girls voice reminds me of Sophie from angels and demons.
Is it me or should the gamma be turned down a bit
It's so rude when a game lets you pet a dog only for the dog to die
Saw this on the Store, wanted to see if anyone had any gameplay... LO AND BEHOLD THE MAN BRAD CAME THROUGH!!!
I started watching your videos when you started playing dead rising
I have been following you for a few years. The first SERIES that I watched you play in full was Resident Evil: Biohazard.
Found your channel in 2014, i searched for dead space gameplay and your vid came first on the list. After watching, i subscribed to your channel and since then i've been always checking for your gameplay updates. Keep it up brad!
I've been watching Rad's channel for years now love it!
I love your channel. I’ve been watching since you played Heavy Rain for ps3.
Found your channel during wolfenstein 2 making me later on getting said game and i was here for the entire days gone series and have started loving you ever since (wolfenstein) and i also use ps4
Damn it the 9:00 part should be censored now im crying
I absolutely hate it when any game or movie portrays an animal, especially a dog dying.
I am really interested in this game now. I was not bored at any time during this gameplay. 👌
Please do full series bro!!! Thx!
The ominous atmosphere and giant gloomy cathedral are right up my alley, gameplay not so much. Gonna sit this one out and watch the walk throughs. Enjoy, Brad
A dog dies within the first 10 minutes, that’s quite tragic
yeaaa.. i'm happy this game played by you. really want see the gameplays
I think he watched gameplay on this game before he considered actually playing it 🤔
Hey brad just wanna day thanks for all the amazing context u bring to me and all the fans never get bored of you and I’m always excited for i new video thank you keep up the great work.
I'm sorry to say this but Hugo is a btch. Just needed to say this. Thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
I found your channel a few weeks ago. Watched days gone. Wasn't a fan of the game but like you so I found  other things to watch.

¬radbrad
If I remeber I think I watched your videos on The Darkness 2 and The Sleeping Dogs back in 2012 so a pretty long time!
They killed you dog and now you are going to have to go all John Wick on them. I found your channel when you did the amazing series Day Gone.
The bad guy sort of looks like Darth Revan's mask
I was curious about this game too, perfect timing.

I started watching during Silent Hill Downpour. Still a personal play through of mine.
i found your channel back during deadspace 2 walkthrough i've been with you ever since and its been a wild but worthwhile ride.
Is it me or this game is better than Last of Us?
Ive been watching your channel for 2 years now, and it has got me through some stuff thank you for being awesome.
This AMICIA has an awful English accent! :)
Love the constant upload of days gone. Keep it up but I had to skip at 8:46 it was too sad for me to watch that part.
I found your channel on Homefront the Revolution walkthrough watched walkthrough on your channel ever since
So somebody made a game about the Rat Plague from Dishonored?
i found your channel when you first uploaded your batman arkam knight serie
After seeing this i need a game for game of thrones
I found your channel back in 2013 when you played Assassins Creed Black Flag
Also fun fact as far as I remember you were the first channel I subscribed to (xb1)
voice acting in this game is... SO SO. love your gameplay Brad
"He's a beast, Hugo does have superpwoes" , this is why we watch Brad XD
Like if you’ve been here since dead island
just wanted to say, which u probably wont see due to all the fans u have, I love ur humbleness and u always get me excited to play new releases! been a fan for a few yrs!
This game looks sick. I love the way they seem to be telling the story, though the part where the boy ran away seemed a little staged XD.
This is definitely more your style..Sekiro had you way out of your league.
Haven't seen your videos in a long time, wow, bravo on 10 million subs!!!
been years i found you dude.
I found the chanel around 5 years ago,  you actaully got me to find one of my favouite games :) i'd love to win a new game to play and experience it myself. Love your videos!
Such a wicked game so far I really hope you play more!! Also I’m pretty sure it was 2013 when I found your channel, I found you when you started posting dead rising 3! Long time fan 😁
Oh man... I don't know if I remember how long I've been watching your stuff. I love it though. Simple and awesome. Keep up the good work!
Can u go back to doing Sekiro? I loved watching you play that game
The rats on the main menu look scaretasticly delicious!
Reminds me visually of dragon age inquisition. But I have yet to play it.
This game is definitely not for trypophobia. haha
I first found your channel when you played Detroit Become Human and I have been a huge fan since! You play the best games and your style of playing makes it feel like I'm right there with you. Watching your videos is the most relaxing part of my day and just an amazing way to take a break from the world and enjoy myself. Keep up the great work!!!
poor lion..... it made me soo sad. The Game looks so good though much love brad <3
Started watching during Detroit becoming human and watch for the games I don’t know if I wanna play or I’m stuck. Thanks for all the great content
Gorgeous game!!! Looking forward to this play through! Found your channel a few years ago and you have to be one of the best gaming channels on YouTube I truly get to immerse in every game with you! Keep up the good work!
I start your channel from quantum break, awesome gameplay as always 😆😆
So excited for this game glad to watch u play it
And my heart is crushed.
I found your channel 3 maybe 4 years ago and i watch almost every single uploads you do.
PLAY THE WHOLE GAME BRAD!!! <3
I love this channel but I'd rather watch days gone
No commentary version 😶!?
I love you man I first started watching your channel when you played “ evil within “
Started watching you around the time you played outlast and i always watch your play through before buying a new game
Literally found your channel just now, it was a suggested video on the fron page. I've been interested to see this game in action since it was announced.
Really wanna play this game ..been watching your videos since dishonored 
Xbox

Brad : Chasing Hugo
Brad : wait can I feed this chicken 😂
You read my mind Brad, this is the game I wanted to see you play.
Do days gone(If you want ) Godd video BTW
Worst playthrough of A Plague Tale I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. Such a shame, Brad.
I found 2012 when I was 6 years good times
Box pls
Please play full game! So interesting already! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
A lot of people coming in this game
Yes please kept show this game please and kept up the good work
After watching the entire video I am liking this even more... wow, hopefully I'll get to play this in the near future!
i think hugo has a bubonic plague because the timeline of this games is 1348 and bubonic plague or black death starts in 1347 but reached europe in 1348 like the timeline of this game
I think I was searching for a full play of heavy rain and found your channel way back when? Then watched the last of us, beyond two souls and detroit become human, looking forward to more of this game as well!
Man the commentary is hilarious.. Loved it.
i was here before the notification lol
I found your channel during your walk through of dead space of course
My ass clenched every time brad sees a guard
I like how brad was pretty happy with the first kill while amicia paused in horror for a few seconds
Those graphical glitchhes though. But still seems like a decent game.
Brad you're the best youtuber ever thank you for keeping me entertained every single day woohoo <3
You won a new sub.👍
HOUGO WAS GOING TO GET ALL OF THEM KILLED 
RAD = can i feed the chickens!!!

Loving the graphics and stealth so far, not sure if enough for a buy...
Asassins Creed 3 (the original playtrough)! Xbox one 😄
i need more of this plz best channel ever ,keep up the good work
The environment of the game feels so awesome!(The town)
I found your channel when you played the last of us that game was epic
You're probably thinking about Deliverance. This game has a Kingdom Come vibe to it.
Damn I wish I had time to play games...
Wait, you can't jump in this game unless you get a key over an obstacle?!
A 50 kg girl trolling a 150 kg armored man....is just ridiculous.
Stop spinning the damn camera like an amateur cinematographer 🤬
The last of us series is when I found your channel your playthroughs are awesome keep up the great work
Ps4 and found your channel in the dead or alive series 😁😁
Found this channel in 2014 doubt i would win but xbox1
Just right now again! It's been awhile since I followed, but one of the main reasons is that even way back when,YOU kept the cussing to a minimum, which few even today can do or control. It's that ever so small thing that you have that most don't, self control and respect. This allowed me to watch you with my then 4 year old son, opening up his world into gaming. I appreciate it now as much as I appreciated it then. THANK YOU!
I started watching you back when you were a contender in midget league MMA.
would love to play this game! adding my only 3 ps4 games:'(
Your my favorite YouTube I watch you every day keep up the good work brother
It’s hard to watch brad plays stealthy games lol
Been here since Dead Island feels like ages since I subbed.

Edit: Technically it has been ages lol
I first found your channel when you were playing sunset overdrive 4 years ago! I love your channel! I play on playstation :)
Arkham City is when I first found your channel. I didn't have the game at the time and wanted to see it. Always enjoy watching your playthroughs.
“He’s doing that curb stomp, he needs to calm down” 😂😂😂😂.
There was a whole state of rats my guy
Definitely play more! This game looks really good. I personally found your channel all the way back in the Shadow of the Colossus days :)
Found your channel back from when you played gta 5 in ps3 ! Copy of ps4 please :)
Hey Brad, I found your channel a couple years back.. I think you were at a couple 100k subs. I've been watching your vids for awhile now :) Thanks for making such great walkthroughs. Really keeps me busy when I am not on my ps4 :)

"I guess Hugo wants to get burn alive" RadBrad famous last words

I think I found your channel back when you started the Walking Dead Series by Telltale! Either that or the first Dead Rising, not quite sure. 
One thing IS for sure: you made me fell in love with those games and watching playthroughs in general. And I thank you for the countless hours of entertainment, Brad!
Lots of love from the Netherlands <3
Found you from tetra ninja like year or 2 ago
This game looks and (probably) feels good to play, but I think the dialogue is really awkward
Finnaly i cant wait till this game is out
Watching for 5 years now 👌🏾
I found your channel in 2016 when you started playing uncharted 4. I don’t care if I don’t win the game but your definitely one of my go to channels.
I discovered your channel by googling RE2 Remake gameplays. :) Also, I think you're the only one who's uploaded an RE2 ghost survivor gameplay/walkthrough. ❤

 Happy I subscribed cause your style of gameplay/let's plays is refreshing, you're chill and funny. ❤
by watching this play through I am starting to think that Europeans were really evil back in the day.
Hello! I just found your channel today after my brother recommended this video. Subbed :)
No idea if I'm too late for the giveaway but I recently stumbled upon your channel whilst looking for Days Gone reviews. I'm only a few episodes off having watched all.
Bro please do ark survival extinction
As soon as I saw the trailer for this game I thought: “I hope Brad does a playthrough of this!” 

And here it is, how convient !
99.99% PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY FOUND YOU'RE CHANNEL BRAD do you care
I found you seven years ago when you played Catherine.
Found your channel last year, and while I have followed, and taken great pleasure in watching you play various titles, by far the best was that one you did with a friend, where you escape (eventually) prison, and go right some wrongs. But the twist at the end surprised you as much as me!!
God Bless you, Brad and long may you  provide entertaining and informative game play!!
Been watching you since about 2014.
I found your channel when I watched the last of us play through
I found your channel way back while Crises 2 walkthrough you’re good man keep the good work up love from india
Not bad for a game that followed days gone

Hey brad I know you won’t see this but I found your channel in 2012 when you played Far Cry  3 it made me become the Far Cry fam I am today

Brad: “well I don’t know where it is”
This game has some potentials, i think you should play the whole game.
When I first found your channel it was during the time you made a gameplay of thief. I was curious how the game was and if I’d like it. Soon I started to binge watch your videos of it. It was amazing and it brings make so much nostalgia of good times. I am very grateful that I found your channel during the time I did. Now I love these types of games more than ever because of you. :)
I dun like how they kill the dog...:(
I found you channel in the the last of us series :) please give me the game, it looks awesom!!
Oh man! I was so excited for another days gone video but I got this instead! Darn, still love you though Brad xD<3
I am new here .. subscribed
I like your channel, because so much kids comment here
in this case with pouty brats tryna blow your cover, normally i say kill them but thats to much. instead id just knock them out
AI in every stealth game: Hears the FAINTEST noise and proceeds to head in that direction to stand around for minutes only to finally realize it must've been the wind
This game really reflects killing in video games and the innocent reaction of her shows the sad realisation we are used to death
Heard it's interesting. Thanks Brad as always. (not interested in winning a copy just wanted to say thanks.)
This looks like FABLE!!
Been following and watching you since your Katherine walkthrough.
I waited for her a while ago
cool video keep it up
dude where is days gone?
Slow down brad i dont know what to watch first😂
Much love from nigeria brad👍
When you first did VAMPYR
Hey, found the channel during first tomb raider playthrough and hqve been in and out as the games interested
The game comes out in 2-3 days and then there's Brad... 
Thank you!
Found your channel way back on The Last of Us when I couldn't aford a console!
Grats on 10 mil 👑
what type of game starts by killing a dog, im sorry but no game should ever kill a dog
Why the fck did the mom just not go with them, like what was her reason for staying? For dramatic effect??
This game looks great, I would love to play it on PS4, I found your channel by chance on my feed two years ago, I hope you do a full series.
Omg I cant wait to play this game!  Got goosebumps watching this.
I Was waiting for days gone And i see that =(
Found your channel when you were playing Prototype 2
Brad, this is a constructive criticism. LISTEN.TO.THE.DIALOGUE. They usually tell you the next objective. You can't rely only on clues on screen because they don't always gives you the best details. For example, the old lady already told you specifically about finding leather to upgrade your sling. But you didn't pay attention until the objective showed up on corner. That is not a good way on playing games - From a long time frustrated fan
Man honestly I can’t remember when I found your channel all Ik is I subscribed around before you got a million subscribers and kept getting happy and tripping out the more faster and faster your channel blew up man. Just want to say keep up the good work you’re awesome bro
I Found your channel in 2008
I was waiting for a day's gone part.... This is kinda boring 🙄
After that dog gone... i couldn't bring myself to watch further.... i will watch in a bit.. but i have to calm down first.. i mean.. OMG WHY THEY HAD TO KILL THE DOG!!!!!  :'(
This looks awesome . Found your channel while searching you tube been hooked ever since .your awesome Brad.
Been a hot minute since I've actually wanted to watch a playthrough on your channel! This game reminds me of the old Last of Us & HitMan Absolution days! <3 I definitely want more of this game Brad!
Them killing off a dog like that makes me hate the game for it’s dark turn but is impressed on how dark it turned
Im first 😂
I found your channel when you were first playing Ryse: Son of Rome. I was then hooked and have watched practically all of your new games. I like that you're a wholesome person avoiding the internet drama and just here for good times. Keep doing what you do.
You always announce the winner on twitter. But I, like others who enjoy your content, do not have Twitter. Could you also announce them here? I mean, does it not make sense to announce the winner where the actual contest is announced? Thank you for all your work and content! Love it!
I found your channel when you played horizon zero dawn and that actually encouraged me to buy a ps4, so thank you for reigniting my passion for gaming
Been with you since Dead Space <3
wow, empowered independent woman, fighting against social injustice and patriarchy.
I found you on youtube!! lol Yer my goto for games
That girl sounds like Currie from fo4
I found your channel in 2013 when looking for a GTA V walkthrough. Been hooked ever since. I would like a PS4 copy BTW
I was so looking forward for the new days gone
Looks amazing, the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired.
Did you remove the music ? I saw the intro in its french version and its has a beautiful music ..
I found your channel in 2014
How the hell im supposed  to win with over 10m subs lol
Get this outta here. DAYS GONE ONLY
I found your channel the first assassins creed unity video and I now watch your channel
nice video brad..loved the game
I started watching your channel since 2014
Ugh, ruined due to commentary.
Cliff hanger on days gone man brutal...
Hey you can speak but not too loud please, that break the ambiance.
I just found your channel. You seem pretty cool. Was watching gameplay and your channel popped up. I want this game! Xbox One please?
Been watching since dead space 1
I won’t lie I stopped watching to go cry for the dog these game developers just cruel 😞 now I gotta cuddle my dog
Where's days gone?
Loved your days gone clips. Please play more of this one as well.
I found your channel during the last of us
i think my fav part about brad is that hes never changed
only chapter one and im tired of Hugos BS
What happened to days gone, not cool
nooooooppee dog dies I continue watching. I'll come back later haha
I love your game play so much, why does this game look 10x with you playing it. I started intensely watching you when you started playing we happy few and haven’t stopped since. I even bought we happy few for my ps4 because of you
You don't need to be a giant to be strong, you just need a sling and a stone throw into the right spot.
I found your channel in your Assassin's Creed Black Flag Walkthrough! Was a blast.
Let's finish Days Gone, I am not going to watch past part 1 of this series until Days Gone is done
Please do a full play though! I love this game already!
Haven't watched Brad in a while; he never fails to make me laugh😂
31:18 I laugh every time Brad finds an animal "HeY BuDdY"
I just chanced on this game today, looks pretty neat!
We need DAYS GONE brad


*Edit : NIce game by the way! Brad!
Nahh Aloy is more savage 😂
Is it me or there's a new trend with games involving hiding in tall grasses?
last time i checked it was hiding in a haystack
@13:13  LOL your paraboid as hell LOLOL
Such a game, please buy it and play the whole game, he deserves it!!
I found your channel when you played assassins creed origins

31:14 reminded me of life is strange 2
Hi , I've been here since the batman Arkham asylum and infamous gameplays loved watching the channel grow so much through out the years going from old gen to new gen was amazing . keep up the good work .

What is with this asmr whispers?
Why only 5 parts to this series
Yay!!!! it's more than 20k likes!!! can't wait for the 2nd part.
I have to say that you are one of a few that i enjoy watching. I have started watching your Chanel when i was stuck while playing Bloodborne. :)
Please Kill him all badguys my buddy please
I really hope you keep playing this game. It looks amazing!
اللعبة حلوة لا اريد احمله ؟؟؟
I found it before i had my ps4 when i was looking for ps4 pro gameplays💕

I found your channel from watch dogs 1
Don't ensemble this as The Last Of Us
I found you back whennyou recorded the walking dead tell tale series.
life is strange 1563
I found your channel from Batman Arkham city, my friend told me about it and ever since then I couldn't stop watching you! Say hi to chubs
animal deaths are more sad than human deaths most times
bro i found your channel back 2014
Brad must've felt sad for the poor dog
This is my first video of yours - I enjoyed it!
Omg I would love this game. I have to be your biggest Canadian fan. I have watched your channel since you posted the first video of TWD season 1.  You are my favourite person to watch on YouTube. My favourite line you use to use was “Come on Q” would love this for the PS4. Thank you for the chance and all the great videos you make.
Looks very interesting already.  How did I find your channel? I was reading and looking for things about Silent Hill Downpour, the only one that I never played, I saw all that walkthrough  And from that moment I subscribed.
i actually dont even remember when i found your channel. ac syndicate videos are the oldest ones that come to mind. anw love your videos dud
I can't decide whether I should get days gone or this ( I am more story driven). Guys help!!!
Aloy’s great great great great great grandmother confirmed
Looks good I'll get it for my xbox one x for better performance, it kinda remind me of hellblade and I loved that game
Might be my new game now ^-^
You can pet the dog! 10/10
I found your channel in 2013. I really hope I win the ps4 copy. I really want to play this game.
I found your channel when i was looking for a watch dogs play through
I found your channel on 2017
You are the best youtuber I love your channel
Ten minutes into the vid and already this holy  cow ...interesting game
Hi rad love your input"
God dayum, that child is annoying.
Do you mean the game AFTER DAWN
"can we feed the chickens?"
Thanks Brad! You could play a white noise game and make it entertaining.
When I found your channel? Man I have no idea how long ago that was
Found your channel when you started rise
Damn he's annoying... sorry I know he's just a kid.
I found your channel when you played Assassins creed Unity. Would love to play this on Xbox one
Love you Brad!!
Love you Brad!!
I found you 2012 when you where playing dishonored, the time when youtube was simpler and nicer
Bro man's gotta eat haha
You got 20k likes 😂❤️
Gonna check this out man. Def subbed now.  What else do you play?
I found your channel like 3 or 4 years ago when you had the video series with the vr head set and got scared when your dog barked at something outside lol
This is my favorite gaming channel. The reason I love it so much is because you sound EXACTLY like my friend Sean! It cracks me up! Keep up the good work!
Too many ads, brad.
Kinda like the game Thief.
Last time I watched you was the “Dead Space” series... its good to be back...
First video I saw of you was saints row 3 and the dlc.
I looked up fqllout 3 walkthroughs and ur channel popped up
It reminds me of Horizon!
GODAMN you are blind
The game you played may have been dishonored
Brad is the game that you played called Brothers?
33:00 "she doesnt know that we can just climb through the window" brad it isn't assasins creed😂
Watched your videos since 2014. To be honest, I have unsubbed a few 
times because of frustration with your gameplay, but always returned for
 the entertainment. Today, I do not have time to play myself because of 
work and family, but I enjoy watching you play and "Days Gone" was just 
awesome ... The fact that the game does not get better reviews, just 
enforces that reviews are divas and completely out of touch with what is
 good. 

Keep it up ... I will still be here when you cannot do it anymore ... 
:)
Wtf is this MC accent LOL
This reminds me of Dishonored for some reason
This kind of game don't suits me... I would prefer game that allow me to sneak behind those soldier and have a sweet sweet neck stab..
I found your channel about 3 years ago!
meanwhile, GoT is imploding on itself thanks to the writers
i already hate this kid but interesting story keep it up!
Found you when you played silent hill down pour.
people in the olden days are very critical blaming one person for everything
This seems like a dope game based off of previews, excited for the playthrough man! Been following you since '09 and plan on sticking around a lot longer!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
i found you're channel when i was 5 im now 13 years of age and ive loved watching u ever since i found u and i hope u keep on making videos and don't worry even once u stop ill still be going back through all the vids you've made
This game reminds me of the game Everybody’s Gone To The Rapture.
Anyone get fable 2 vibes from this
I found your channel about 5 months ago but only watched a few videos, but i’ve started to watch more just a few days about to watch you play Days Gone but i’m definitely staying longer for this game
I found your channel back around bo2
I liked this game
This game is osm
Ive always thought english caused the rat plague by turning rats into biological weapon, and then german retaliate with true biological weapon, deadly gas.
Found this channel when I was looking for how to beat far cry 3 lol shortly after the launch of Xbox one ...PS4 Incase i win😁
dog dies 
How Convenient!
Amazing video I need this💪🏽 I started to watch a little after fallout 3 wonderful time
k this game looks sick xD
Days gone 2
That kid, I appreciate his honesty, but I hate how he keeps complaining any asking stupid questions.
This game has some gorgeous music. Why in the world would you turn it off???
NOBODY EXPECTS THE FRENCH INQUISITION
Just found it a month ago.  Please let it be me.
7:30 Should've turned left.
31:09 No duh.
@kubz scouts
22:16 the mother do a victory 360
Hey brad , not sure if you’ll see this but I was wondering do you ever feel rushed playing games on your channel? Like you can’t leisurely play? I was just wondering.
I don't have a PS4 or an Xbox but I'm gonna post a comment anyway.
So interesting already !! i am loving it.
been here since the last of us
I found your channel on 2015 January
Holy shit the voice acting is super good

Amicia: MUMMY IS DEAD, HUGO!! You’ll never see her again!! Or Daddy!!

My thought: Damn straight Amicia, you tell that god damn demon child!!!
been watching since 2012 far cry 3
The boss fight at the end is literally a replica of the one at the church in Dead Island
I don’t really like Amicia’s voice actor
Thor enters "You should've gone for the head"
Been on the channel since The Evil Within 1, great memories
Been here since 2mil
40:50 there was an odd glitch where the head of the lady turned 180 degrees without moving her body.
For a sickly child hugo can run pretty fast. Apperently faster then a teenage girl who should be quite fit
When did I find you're channel well cause of poor life choices my memory sucks but I it was sometime in 2012 can't remember the game I watched you play though.
David and Goliath
My brother lead me here and now I am OBSESSED!
For anyone unsure of the setting: It's hard to tell based on the accents, though some of the more convincing ones sounded Spanish. It's almost definitely during the Spanish Inquisition given the undertones of politics surrounding the "Inquisition", and the brutality displayed in the game and historically, as well as the plage themes,  so I'll assume it's Spain during the Early Renaissance.
Hey buddy....you probably won’t see this but just had to let you know about how you have effected/changed my life. I am unfortunately a 59 year old woman who has recently become disabled. These video games are the FIRST I have played in my life. I am clumsy, uncoordinated, confused and definitely do not have good instincts for this. YOU my friend have made this a pleasure to get involved with. I get stuck, and I get stuck all the time, but I hear your voice and I know it will be ok. Thanks a lot for taking the time to show us newbies the ropes. Who said you can’t teach an old dog some new tricks.
Call Hugo "Little man"
Turn the game music on!!
Insane Graphics ♥️
This game looks wonderful wow!!
This game actually looks really cool and the puzzles are great
You are amazing man just amazing
10:26 is it The Order 1886?
Watching Brad play hurts me physically
Found you at evil within Bruv!
i ended up liking this game a lot
Someone compared this game to be like LiS2 & i was like, “but Daniel is a shithead (ofc he’s like 9 years old). Then I see Hugo run off after Amicia yells at him & I’m like “mhm theres the resemblance”.😂
First walkthrough i watched on your channel was far cry 3. Back then i had nothing to play on so i used to watch you play instead and it was awesome. I never watched gameplay on youtube before I started watching your videos! 




Now i have something to play on and enough money to buy any game i want so i dont want a free copy, but wanted you to know your videos have been a big part of wellbeing in certain periods of my life! Thanks for that
I have a ps4 would like to win a copy
voice actors are... cringe...
Love the videos good job bro
More please!!!
Fucked that dog UP!
I don't know anything about this game..... But for me is pretty obvious that Hugo can control the rats! Not now but lately. For me is a sure buy!
Was the game last of us.  This game reminded u of that game
Brad can you turn on the game soundtrack
It seems like any game that has a dog in it somehow makes the dog die
I have been watching since 2014
More likes than views? What devilrey is this?!
Back in 2012, Halo 4; man those were different times
41:17 I though you were French!? XD
Everyone was bashing the game, but I think it looks amazing, and I found your channel around 2013. During the Dead Rising 3 walkthrough. (Xbox one) :p
OH HELL NO THE RATSSSS 😂
I found your channel 2012
I like this game but iI would have liked it more if Lion had survived
I hope you end up doing a full play through.
i am so excited for this game
hey can you give me a snap shot at your face
Don't do it Anakin! I have the high grass!
Hey radbrad I find your video when the first evil within was out
part 2 asap pls and pls make them longer than 20 mins
Bruh I just love rad Brad so much bro don't ever delete your channel
werry wery best game i love it
Brad, started watching your channel in January while overcoming a serious surgery; I couldn't sit and play my games myself so watching you was awesome.  Now, even though I'm back on my Xbox, I'm going back and watching all your stuff; it's great.  Thank you!!!
Graphics are AWESOME!
Rip days gone letsplay
Amazing game so far. 👌👌👌
Love this game..  I'm getting it
This game looks so interesting i really want it on my xbox
I LOVE all of your walk throughs! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! You really are RAD Brad!!! Can I have a PS4 copy of this game? Or Xbox1... if not, I appreciate your videos so much! You have helped me through so many games!!! THANK YOU!!!
No one expects the Spanish inquisition!
Very Beautiful game.
Found your channel at Dead Space
If you are still watching 2019 radbrad. And still complaining about he is missing obvious things and messing up missions. Then you have a mental issue.
I really liked this game
Hey Brad, been watching your videos since 2015
Welp...they killed the dog....that's enough for me.
Lol she is completely flat chested hahahaha her grandma has double Ds lmao HAHAHAHAHAHA
I hope you choose me if I get the game it will be good (ps4)
Love the channel bro!
It says this game is made by asobo the people who used to be owned by thq like their movie tie in games
This looks beautiful
Yes ps4 2016
NOBODY EXPECTED THE SPANISH INQUISITION
You have to play a female? Shits gay
And this is why sony is greAt! Xbox I feel doesn’t give you games like this. Is this on pc?
Instant masterpiece.
YES!!!!!! :)
That girl is thicc
The graphics and movement of the game reminds me of assassin screed
I want to watch this but honestly turning off game music for every single playthrough really takes away from the experience
This game gives me the fable vibes fr, I want to play that again or something like it at least
This looks interesting! I'd like to see more!
Just seen the 10minutes and so far I lm felling the game!!
Am I the only one who wants to hug Hugo
I just bought it today. Haven't played it yet since I am at work, but it reminds me a lot of Last of Us, which was and still is my all time favorite game. I hope this game doesn't disappoint my expectations :)
XD thought I put notification bell on
I found your channel somewhere in 2015 during the Dying Light playthrough.I instantly subbed :) I love your videos man and I would like a chance to win this game on ps4
Do part 4 please Brad quick
is this game inspired by the Black Plague? Cause the black plague was transmitted from rats to humans.
Good game.  Please do next parts also
Poor dog 🥺
Awwwwww the mother got killed thats sad 😔
BEST GAMER CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE
The game is amazing
NNOO!! THE DOGGO TUT WHY? 😭😭
She has an Icelandic accent. The main character.
mama i killed a man
I like it but it seems too dark for me. But I'll still watch for your brad .
I have been waiting for this brad!!!!!
A great story game for real🖤
i hate it when a pet dies😢
does this game use raytracing?
This game looks so good
RIP Lion man I really feel sorry for the dog
Man I don’t know if I ever could be a YT gamer like brad. I would be exploring to much and not many viewers might like it. Brad you are amazing and one day dream of being a YT gamer. Hard to say when I found your channel but have seen the South Park stick of truth series and many others.
Found your channel in 2016
oh no you f up that’s John wicks sister
Your video is studdering so much Wtf
Heeeeyyyy Buuddy
Never trust a small quite child named Hugo.
I fell in love with Amicia, lol
I don't like when devs put Children in the game. They ask just as many questions as real kids.
I found your channel in 2013
so much effort to make a garbage game.. how disappointing. or perhaps this girl is best slingshooter ever
The girl looks like Ayra Stark (Maisie Williams)  in the face
Ok This is a theory. Her mother knew that he could cure the sickness but, she didn't have enough time to figure out a cure.
The spec ops
skaven intensify
Need new game
aIm FoR dA HeAd
Your thinking about fable
34:30 tell us more ;)
I’ve just discovered you today and this is the first video of yours I’ve seen! I’ve been looking for some let’s play YouTubers and stumbled across this video. I’ve subscribed and now I’ve now got a backlog of videos of awesome games to watch !
Ohhhh... My... Gods...
Love your stuff
Not the Doge!!!!! 😱😱😱
That got dark real quick
nice bro
How is this guy so successful and pleasing. I’ve been watching brad since far cry religiously however don’t comment much. Without a webcam so much support love you brother!❤️❤️
So no combat? Like she can't have a sword ... smh
awesome job Brad!
My god this game is magical. It's unique.
This game looks amazing!!
Game looks pretty good for those that like stealth.
